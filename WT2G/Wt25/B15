<H1>ReExamining 
Limb Salvage in Diabetic Patients
with Renal Failure</H1>
<P><I>by Christopher E. Attinger, MD</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Is current pessimism toward salvage of the infected limb in the diabetic patient with renal failure justified?</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>Current statistics suggest that high-risk diabetic patients have a 50 percent chance of losing an infected foot or lower leg--let alone a gangrenous foot--upon presentation to a medical facility. Even worse, the diabetic patient's chance of losing the contralateral limb within five years of the first amputation is 50 percent, and the chance of dying from cardiac disease within that same time period is also 50 percent. Fortunately, advances in aggressive wound care, distal revascularization, and careful limb preservation techniques have increased successful salvage rates to 80-95 percent. This high rate is possible when diabetic patients with foot problems are seen by a diabetic foot team that includes a wound specialist, orthopedist, podiatrist, vascular surgeon, plastic surgeon, infectious disease specialist, endocrinologist, pedorthist, rehabilitation specialist, and hyperbarist. The medical community is gradually recognizing the benefit of such a specialized team approach and is increasingly referring patients to diabetic centers.
<P>However, diabetic patients with renal failure who present with an infected or gangrenous foot face far more alarming statistics: 25 - 40 percent undergo immediate amputation without any salvage attempt and 25 percent of these patients die during the peri-operative period. When revascularization is attempted, 60 to 100 percent of those patients die within three years of the surgery. Recent vascular literature is so pessimistic in its approach to these patients that some authors recommend primary amputation instead of revascularization or salvage attempts.
<P>Renal failure complicates the already compromised wound healing ability of diabetic patients. Vascular disease is accelerated with renal failure and more than half of renal failure, diabetic patients require revascularization before the foot can be salvaged (versus one-fourth to one-third of diabetic patients without renal failure). Renal failure patients have depressed immune function and impaired healing ability, which means the foot is subject to more frequent and more serious infections. These wounds can take up to three times longer to heal and therefore are more susceptible to dehiscence or recurrence.

<H2>Registry Review</H2>
The negative medical attitude towards the threatened extremity of diabetics with renal failure led us to review procedures at our institution to see if current pessimism is justified. Of the 237 diabetic patients entered in Georgetown University's diabetic foot registry between 1990 and 1994, 47 were consecutive renal failure diabetic patients with 55 threatened limbs. We followed their progress though May 1996. Twenty-eight patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) had creatine greater than 1.7 (average: 2.6), 15 patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRD) were on hemodialysis, and four were renal transplant patients. The average age of the CRF patients was 60; the ESRD patients' average age was 52; and for the transplant patients, the average was 45. Medically, the condition of the dialysis patients was the most dire, due to the ravages of atherosclerosis. Eighty percent had suffered a heart attack or were in congestive failure, 27 percent had suffered a stroke, and 80 percent had retinopathy.
<P>CRF and transplant patients most often presented with ulcers or osteomyelitis while the dialysis patients presented with frank gangrene. The wounds of CRF patients most often were located in the forefoot; ESRD and transplant patients had wounds equally distributed between the forefoot and the mid or hindfoot. Our initial approach was to assess the patient's vascular status, debride the wound surgically, and obtain deep cultures. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were then started. 

<H2>Revascularization Standards</H2>
If pulses were not palpable, the patient was sent to the noninvasive vascular lab. Revascularization was considered when a flat pulse wave was recorded at either the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery and/or when the digital artery pressure was less than 30 mm Hg. Revascularization was also performed if the eventual soft tissue reconstruction was to involve either a pedicled muscle flap or microsurgical free flap. Fifty-two percent of the limbs required revascularization. Over half of these were sophisticated distal vein bypasses to the arteries of the ankle or foot.
<P>Reconstruction was not considered until the wound edges were soft and wrinkled and all erythema had disappeared. Unfortunately, two below-knee amputations were necessary to control spreading infection. Evidence that the wound had healing capacity (granulation tissue or neoepithelialization) also was necessary. To achieve this, multiple surgical debridements had to be performed and the patients often were treated as outpatients on home I.V. antibiotics and serial dressing changes until the wound was ready to be closed. In our experience Silvadene was remarkably effective at sterilizing the wound bed without inhibiting wound healing.
<P>Wound closure required a combination of local amputations and soft tissue coverage techniques. Most amputations were in the forefoot--involving the phalanges and metatarsal heads--although Lisfranc and Chopart amputation techniques also were utilized. Biomechanical consideration often dictated either Achilles tendon lengthening or tenodesis to be performed at the same time. Soft tissue closures usually were straightforward and principally involved skin grafting, local flaps, or skin flaps.
<P>There was a high complication rate (37 percent) associated with treating these patients. Most involved delayed healing due to dehiscence, partial flap, or skin graft loss. Fortunately, medical complications were low and only one peri-operative death occurred. Nine wounds did not heal: three of these went on to BK amputations, two patients (three wounds) subsequently died with open wounds, and three went on to be healed by secondary intention.
<P>The average hospital stay per wound was approximately one month for both the CRF and dialysis patient and two weeks for transplant patients. The CRF and dialysis patients' wounds took an average of 100 days to heal, while the transplant patients' wounds healed in half that time. The wounds stayed healed for 14 to 17 months. Unfortunately, a 23 percent recurrence rate occurred, most often due to inadequate shoewear, biomechanical abnormality, and patient neglect.
<P>The limb salvage rate in this series of 55 threatened lower extremities was 91 percent at 2+ years and only five BK amputations were required. Previously published results have only achieved a 65 percent salvage at one year. More importantly, the survival rate was 66 percent at 2+ years with 70 percent of the CRF patients and 50 percent of the dialysis patients still alive. This is in comparison to previously published reports with a 0-40 percent survival rate at three years.
<P>The current pessimism in the medical literature towards attempting to salvage the threatened extremity in the renal failure diabetic patient may be unwarranted. By using a team effort and ensuring that the wound is aggressively treated by debridement, topical wound care, I.V. antibiotics, and sophisticated revascularization techniques, the infection and gangrene can be eliminated and a healthy wound can then emerge. A combination of limited foot amputations, biomechanical rebalancing, and soft tissue closure techniques then restores the foot so that it can again function. Moreover, more progress is clearly attainable if that 23 percent recurrence rate is addressed with better shoewear and better attention to biomechanical problems.

<H2>Spaced out Shannon</H2>
Shannon Lucid, the record-breaking U.S. space traveler, is in the midst of a physical rehabilitation program to reacclimate her body to the demands of gravity. NASA experts say this process generally takes anywhere from four to eight weeks, but that subtle differences in gait and other movement adopted in space's weightless environment may be evident months longer.
<P>The body undergoes phenomenal adjustments to microgravity. Being in space, said Joe Ortega, MD, a NASA flight surgeon, "is like lying down all the time." Since the body doesn't have to work against gravity to pump blood to the brain, it rids itself of approximately 10 percent of its fluid within the first 36 hours of space travel. Even with exercise, muscles needed to support a person against gravity quickly atrophy. Some bone mass is typically lost and head-eye coordination changes. 
<P>About an hour before landing, astronauts drink an isotonic solution to regain the fluid their bodies expelled in space. They also wear a cooling system that constricts blood vessels and a special suit that squeezes the blood from their legs upward. These measures are designed to prevent orthostatic intolerance--or in other words, fainting from a lack of blood to the brain upon standing. 
<P>"We won't want Lucid to do much in the first week," explained Dr. Ortega, "because her muscles are weakened. After about five days of rest she'll go into a rehab program, and from there it will take four to eight weeks to fully recover."  

<H2>BioMechanics Desk Reference</H2>
The 1997 <CITE>BioMechanics Desk Reference</CITE> is now in production and scheduled to be mailed in mid-January. The second volume will feature an index to prior issues of <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>, and several dozen articles covering topics from Aquatic Therapy to X-ray. A survey of <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> readers showed that more than 90 percent of respondents used the BDR throughout the year and consulted it 10 or more times. 

<h2>PFA readies for San Antonio</h2>
The Pedorthic Footwear Association is putting the finishing touches on its annual seminar, to be held this year on November 14 in historic San Antonio. Leading topics under discussion will include orthotic materials and gait analysis. Two workshops on the World Wide Web will be conducted by <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> Editor Edwin Black and Bradley Kliewer, the webmaster for the magazine's 15 <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> and <CITE>Stride</CITE> web sites. The party highlight of the event will be the "BioMechanics and Stride Fiesta," sponsored by Soft Spots Shoes, and cosponsored by JMS Plastics, Johnson &#38; Johnson Orthopaedics, OrthoDynactive, and UCO International. A sumptuous gait altering Mexican buffet will be accompanied by the wild Mucho UCO Mariachis and Dancers, assembled by UCO International. Tickets for this year's events can be obtained on-site from the booths of Soft Spots, as well as JMS, Johnson &#38; Johnson Orthopaedics, and OrthoDynactive.

<H2>Double-jointed kids</H2>
Double-jointed children are more likely to develop bunions, according to Alan H. Shaw, DPM. During a 12-year period, Dr. Shaw surgically treated 120 bunions on 65 patients from six to 20 years of age. The group included 47 girls and 18 boys. "Most children with bunions have them as a result of hypermobility of the joints (double-jointed) and flat foot," explains Dr. Shaw. "When you add hypermobile joints to a flatfooted child, the result is a serious combination that can eventually lead to a bunion formation. 
<P>Children will complain of arch pain, strain, and calf tightness, which should not be mistaken for shin splints or pulled muscles. The pain and strain is a result of the tightened Achilles and calf muscle group. Joint deformity and deterioration eventually set in. Dr. Shaw always advises conservative treatment first, including foot orthoses and for girls, avoidance of heels of more than two inches, if at all. Dr. Shaw found no indication of greater prevalence among highly active or athletic children.

<H1>Snowboarding: The Injury and the Ecstasy</H1>
<P><I>by Peter Janes, MD &#38; Terrell Joseph</I>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>Adrenaline rushes through your veins. You can hear your heart pounding inside your chest. As you fly down the slope, faceshots of champagne snow remind you that you're alive. A few balanced turns later you find yourself meandering around a turn, eloquently gliding across silken snow. Welcome to snowboarding, the world's fastest growing winter sport.
<P>Over the past decade, surfing on snow, or snowboarding, has skyrocketed into a full-blown industry. Snowboarding is no longer just for rebellious teenage "skate-rats." It is now being enjoyed by thousands of men, women, and children of all ages. Its image as a genuine sport has also grown. In fact, in the winter of 1998, snowboarding will finally become an Olympic event. Japan will be the host as competitors run gates on high-tech racing snowboards. 
<P>So what's the attraction? Why the newfound craze? Despite a particularly rowdy first day or two, snowboarding is relatively easy to learn--much easier then skiing. Its learning curve is "frightfully steep but mercifully short," explains Bill Gottlieb, MD, a Colorado emergency room physician and avid snowboarder. After a few hours, beginner riders find themselves cruising the bunny slopes with ease. Sean Warren, a veteran snowboard instructor on Vail Mountain, explains, "It's wonderfully unsophisticated; you just stand up and lean, the board does most of the work." The kinetics are a familiar, whole body motion. By shifting their weight from the toe-side to the heel-side edge, snowboarders control the direction of the board. Surfing on snow is composed of single, direct leans using one edge at a time. The motion is intuitive; you lean to the left and you go to the left.
<P>Snowboarding doesn't require the complex left/right synchrony necessary for smooth skiing. Nor does it demand the mirrored coordination and timing from all four extremities that skiing does. What's more, poles aren't necessary for snowboarding; this enables snowboarders to use their hands to help with balance.
<P>Many former skiers are turning to snowboarding. This group, dubbed "crossovers," are typically men in their 30s or 40s who have skied for 10 years or more. They prefer stiff ski-type boots and hard plate bindings with superb edge control. In fact, some are almost able to touch their shoulder to the snow before rising up in the next turn. 

<H2>Boards and Boots</H2>
During the last decade the snowboard industry has grown from a couple of basement operations to more than 200 snowboard manufacturers. Snowboards are now fabricated of everything from wood and fiberglass to kevlar and carbon-fiber, and they come in varying degrees of stiffness. Snowboard boots range from soft, lace-up "moon boots" to hard, plastic shelled ski-type boots. Soft or "hybrid" boots are the most popular, combining comfort and support. In the past, the binding system attaching the boot to the board has consisted of locking straps that some snowboarders find difficult to use. This is significant because as snowboarders push their way through the lift line, they must free their backfoot from the board. Some newer boots and bindings preserve the comfort of the soft "moon boot" feel while offering a locking step-in/step-out mechanism. The boots click in and out of the board just as bicycle shoes click in and out of pedals. Theoretically, with this new system, the boot is easier to attach and detach for chairlift rides.
<P>Manufacturers are working to incorporate more safety into their products. One safety issue--the argument for releasable bindings--is still subject to debate. Currently, most boards remain attached to the foot during a fall. At first, this seems dangerous but, in reality, when you crash the board it stays away from the face and head. In contrast, ski crashes result in a chaotic jumble of ski and poles flipping and flying around the face. Moreover, if snowboards with releasable bindings allow only one foot to come unclicked, then this subjects the lower extremity to rotation. This rotation quickly creates torsional strain on the knee, precisely providing the mechanism necessary to tear ligaments. A releasable binding system in which both boots release simultaneously may be safer but has yet to be thoroughly investigated or perfected.
<P>Snowboard boot manufacturers are also now designing boots with more ankle support. The assumption is that a stiffer boot may decrease the incidence of ankle injuries in snowboarders. However, the jury is still out on that one. The rigid boot that may protect the ankle may instead transmit forces to the leg and knee. 

<H2>Snap, Crackle, and Pop</H2>
The potential energy stored while snowboarding does not come without a price. As in any other sport in which the athlete ballistically flies through space, there is the potential to get hurt. There is a virtual potpourri of snap, crackle, and pop associated with snowboarding. Few know this better than the group of surgeons at Vail-Summit Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine. During the past eight years, this group has been compiling snowboard injuries from 18 medical centers representing 12 Colorado ski resorts. The Colorado Snowboard Injury Study is a growing collection of more than 4,000 physician-diagnosed snowboard injuries, ranking the project as the largest snowboarding study in the world. More than 60 orthopedic surgeons, emergency room and family practice physicians, with the assistance of physician assistants and physical therapists, have submitted information on snowboard injuries from across the state. Our study is investigating everything from the mechanism of injury to the type of equipment in use when the injury occurred. The results, presented biannually to the International Congress on Ski Trauma and Safety Symposium, offer interesting insights.
<P>For example, the Colorado Snowboarding Injury Study determined that one of the most common injuries is falling on one's wrist. Indeed almost 25 percent of snowboard injuries are to the distal forearm and wrist. Fracture of the distal radius leads the pack, representing more than 80 percent of all wrist injuries. Of 976 diagnosed wrist injuries, 50 percent were reported sustained by beginners or those with no snowboarding experience at all. 
<P>Forty-two percent of diagnosed snowboard injuries are fractured bones. That yields 1,721 broken bones and miles of casting material. A separate 1,000 patients presented with sprains/strains of ligaments in the shoulder, knee, and ankle. The forward leg on the snowboard affects 80 percent of lower extremity injuries. Knee injuries are not uncommon but are twice as frequent in skiers. All in all, the overall rate of injury between skiers and snowboarders is the same: approximately 3-4 per 1,000 skiers/snowboarders-days. 
<P>To better understand how injuries occur, consider the crash itself. The first hours on a snowboard can be frustrating to say the least. Just like learning to ride a bicycle, when the snowboard slows down, the tendency is to fall over. Usually, the fall is forward or backwards and onto an outstretched arm and wrist. Instructors teach students to ball up their fist or use their elbows to break the fall. Secondly, once a person musters up some speed, he wants to ride on one edge and only on one edge. If the snowboarder allows the other edge to accidentally catch, he basically folds like a hinge and his body is sucked to the earth with remarkable speed and force.
<P>Falling, as described, is the most common mechanism of injury. Contrary to what many skiers believe, collisions with skiers represent only seven percent of snowboard injuries. There are, however, other ways to end up in the emergency room. One sure way is to collide with a tree or any other firmly grounded object. Expert snowboarders rationalize that snowboarding through groups of trees is made easier by the position of the body on a snowboard. B.J. Carrington, an expert rider from Boulder, explains, "Going between trees is like going through a series of doorways, your body is positioned sideways and you go through one shoulder at a time. Plus," he adds, "you don't have any poles so your hands are available for all the branches." Needless to say, the surgeons at the bottom of the hill stay busy.
<P>The Colorado Snowboard Injury Study also identified a lower extremity injury that appears to be unique to snowboarding. A fracture of the lateral process of the bone at the junction of the foot and ankle--the talus--is seen so frequently from snowboard falls that it has earned notoriety as "Snowboarder's Talus Fracture." The mechanism of the injury (fracture talus) is generally thought to be a sudden, severe dorsiflexion. Catching a front edge seems to be the culprit, thereby hyperdorsiflexing the foot towards the head. 
<P>The fracture may present itself as a bad ankle sprain and is difficult to diagnosis from an X-ray alone. Computerized tomography (CT) is often necessary to fully diagnose and clearly identify this fracture. It is important for physicians to be aware of Snowboarder's Talus Fracture because failure to treat it can lead to non-union of the fragmented bone. The snowboarder then risks developing an activity limiting, post-traumatic arthritis.
<P>According to our study, physicians are also seeing higher incidences of other serious injuries: fractured spines, ruptured organs, and multiple diagnoses. Doctors are repairing more femur and tibia/fibula fractures in expert snowboarders. Our study identified closed head injuries, sustained by 81 snowboarders who did not wear a helmet. Riders with this immortal mentality too often fail to appreciate the necessity of health insurance. This "no fear" attitude typifies the high-risk logic that some snowboarders demonstrate. Our study indicates that more riders consider themselves "experts" and their riding style reflects the resulting injury pattern. The hype associated with the snowboarding craze has fueled an environment of risk-taking, especially in younger riders. Consider this scenario: the film camera is running, the photographer lets out a whistle. A 19 year old white male with two earrings (one in his lip, the other in his nose) approaches a 25-ft. "kicker" jump fully intending to execute a 720 degree spin in the air. He hits it with just a little too much speed. Result: Big hospital air.
<P>All in all, statistics show that snowboarding is no more dangerous than skiing. Snowboarding provides tens of thousands of people a rewarding sense of accomplishment and relative mastery after just a few day. It's not for everyone, but many who try it, including doctors and nurses alike, claim they will never ski again.

<H3>Five Steps to Preventing Injury While Snowboarding</H3>
</CENTER>
<UL><LI>Advise your patients that if they insist on leaving the earth, they need to have a plan. Too many riders end up in the emergency room due to "flat landings."</UL> 
<UL><LI>Patients should be told that using the right equipment is essential. Properly fitted boots are a must, and a board of proper length must be chosen.</UL> 
<UL><LI>Advise them to take lessons. Qualified instructors teach useful techniques for beginners. The first day or two may mimic a small automobile accident, but an instructor can show snowboarders ways to reduce the number of falls.</UL>
<UL><LI>Snowboarders should wear a helmet. Icy conditions cause many falls and the ice is as hard as concrete.</UL> 
<UL><LI>Snowboarders should wear a wristguard--especially in the beginning. Remember, 25 percent of all snowboard injuries are to the wrist and over half of these wrists belong to beginners. Grandoe gloves is developing a lightweight wristguard specifically for snowboarders. It is highly recommended and may be available for rental right along with the snowboard.</UL>

<H2>We've increased our frequency from 10 times per year to monthly--two more issues. You asked for it. You got it.</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Welcome to our final regular issue of the year. What a year, and it's still not over. Since October, we seem to be producing almost one magazine issue every other week. 
<P>Our special Paralympic issue recently mailed and was well received at the annual meeting of the American Orthotic and Prosthetic Association in Cincinnati. In a few days, some 10,000 distributing practitioners and hundreds of comfort shoe stores will receive the winter issue of <CITE>Stride</CITE>. We are rushing to complete the January issue of <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> to mail before Christmas. Our staff and contributors are finishing two specialty-specific reports on "Practice in the Next Century," one for O&#38;P and one for podiatry. A third special report for orthopedists, "Managed Care and the Orthopedic Surgeon," will mail in time for the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons annual meeting in San Francisco. 
<P>Soon the 1997 <CITE>BioMechanics Desk Reference</CITE> will dizzy our small staff with nearly 30 articles and special features, as well as thousands of commercial listings and descriptions. All of our websites are constantly growing and being updated with new information as we record some 20,000 hits monthly; indeed our websites are among the most visited practitioner sites in the world. Our newest is the Wound Management Home Page. While all this is happening, we are hard at work nailing down an exciting 1997 editorial lineup that will yield a fascinating combination of hardhitting features and clinical application articles. Expect new columns in surgery, electrotherapy, and comfort shoes. Our new <A HREF="/biomech/nov96/wound.html">wound management</A> column launches this issue.
<P>And the most important news is we've increased our frequency from 10 times per year to monthly--two more issues. You asked for it. You got it.
<P>As we look toward Thanksgiving and the year-end holidays, we at <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> have much to be thankful for. Practitioners in some 10 specialties have given a profound vote of confidence to our special brand of independence and cross-specialty thinking. In response, we have developed <CITE>Stride</CITE> and our specialty-specific issues. Our editorial is not for sale, and readers know this. Advertisers large and small have accepted our independence and your demand for it. For example, this issue is our biggest ever in advertising pages (outside of the <CITE>BioMechanics Desk Reference</CITE>). And already advertisers have renewed or increased their commitments extending to 1998, ensuring the continuing independence of <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>. Indeed, within three hours of our announcing the two added 1997 issues, most of our leading advertisers signed on for the extras.
<P>We maintain close working relationships with virtually all recognized professional associations. And each week dozens of expert practitioners stop their day to provide us with expertise or to review manuscripts. These practitioners often work without any recognition. Most are not even on our special Board of Advisors. So in our special <A HREF="/biomech/nov96/reviewers.html">reviewer recognition</A> section, we've listed several dozen who have worked with us during the past half year.
<P>Also every week, numerous practitioners call us to complain about inequities they perceive or experience, either from managed care, commercial sources, the healthcare field in general, and not infrequently from each other. We will continue to advance the cause of cross-specialty cooperation and success, and promote the benefits of the biomechanics mainstream to the American public. 
<P>If all that seems like a lot, hey, it keeps us busy to the bone. But it could be worse; if no one cared, we'd have nothing to do. Thank you for a great 1996, for ensuring an even better 1997, and most of all, thank you for caring.
<P>See you at the PFA in San Antonio and the AAOS in San Francisco.

<H1>The Economics of Wound Care</H1>
<P><I>by Tamara D. Fishman, DPM and Allan Freedline, DPM</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Although many variables are involved in wound care treatment, the medical community must find ways to measure these issues to compete in the managed care arena.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=2><B>Editor's Note:</B>
<P><CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> has published occasional articles on wound care in our Team Diabetic section, in the <CITE>BioMechanics Desk Reference</CITE>, and in our specialty-specific issues. In examining wound care more closely, we realize how significant a practice concern this area has become for all of our readers. That's why we're launching a new bimonthly column, <B>Wound Management</B>. Our inaugural column introduces the biomechanics mainstream to the economics of wound care, because as managed care tightens, outcomes become more important. Wound care is not only the concern of the medical and surgical practitioner. The entire biomechanics health team is vital, including but not limited to orthotists involved in pressure distribution casting, pedorthists engaged in protective and compensatory shoe modification, as well as physical therapists, occupational therapists, nutritionists, and others. The spectrum of wound management covers everything from high-tech dressings to low-tech soft goods to specially designed pillows and mattresses. Looking ahead, we'll publish a lengthy overview of regimens in the <CITE>BioMechanics Desk Reference</CITE>, and then every other month explore specific treatment categories and modalities. 
<BR>--<B>Edwin Black</B></FONT>
<HR>
<P>In 1995 approximately 10 million wounds in the United States required medical care due to etiologies that included trauma, burns, diabetes, pressure, and venous and arterial dysfunctions. Treatment costs alone are estimated at five to seven billion dollars annually. 
<P>Adding to the treatment costs are the estimated 25,000 wound care products on the market. This $1.74 billion industry is expected to grow steadily through the year 2000. Moreover, the aging population and increased number of chronic wounds are setting the stage for even more wound care demands and higher expenditures.  
<P>Wound management must and indeed is changing from an art to a science. Practitioners today realize that wound care is no longer made up of Band-Aids, Povidone-Iodine, and gauze. The multi-specialty approach has decreased both direct and indirect costs to the healthcare system while improving the patient's quality of life and providing a new level of satisfaction to the practitioner. 
<P>Positioning yourself as a wound care specialist serves three important functions. To begin with, your practice will receive an infusion of patients and fees associated with debridement, X-rays, laboratory testing, physical therapy modalities, office visits, and ancillary services. Furthermore, by providing faster healing rates, your efforts will save the healthcare system a substantial amount of money per wound. Most important, the improved quality of life that your patients attain is almost immeasurable.  
<P>Managed care's cost containment ideology dictates that wounds be treated and healed by the most cost-effective methods available. To prove positive outcomes, we must define standards of care, healing rates, algorithms, and critical pathways. Although many variables are involved in wound care treatment, the medical community must determine a way to measure these issues to compete in the managed care arena. 
<P>With all the focus on controlling costs, is your practice arming itself with these vital statistics? Primary care physicians need a reason to refer a wound patient to a specialty center or physician. Charting particular outcomes and protocols will be especially important in being included on managed care plans and being perceived as the wound care leader in your community. Whether you are practicing in an outpatient clinic, private office, or through a hospital, the following areas of concern must be addressed:
<P>1. Achieving faster healing rates.
<P>2. Lowering rates of infection, amputation, and complications.
<P>3. Decreasing the length of stay for your wound patients.
<P>4. Evaluating critical pathways.
<P>5. Developing physician education tools.
<P>6. Examining and possibly rewriting protocols for your facility.
<P>Healthcare providers should survey and critically analyze all areas of wound care in terms of their own practice. For example, practitioners could compare their outcomes with community and national standards to determine if certain areas of wound care would be better served by another specialist. The managed care penetration in a community also must be taken into consideration. 
<P>While the costs of health care in the U.S. are staggering, one area where immediate cost containment can be achieved is wound care. Simultaneously, the patient's quality of life is improved through resumption of daily activities. Practitioners should take the time to retool themselves with the knowledge they need to become a wound care leader.

<H1>Foot and Ankle Taping for Dancers</H1>
<P><I>by Sean P. Gallagher, PT</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>For dancers, taping can be a workable and more aesthetically pleasing solution than bracing.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>Lower extremity injuries make up more than 70 percent of all dancer injuries and most of the ligament sprains are due to extreme lateral inversion. Causes can include poor footwear, slippery floors, learning a new repertoire, poor technique, fatigue, and being out of shape. All but poor technique are relatively easy to remedy in a short period of time. Poor technique, however, requires neuromuscular reeducation to avoid chronic re-injury patterns in the foot and ankle. Dancers must spend time on preventative exercises and movement lessons functionally based on their particular dance style and technique.
<P>In my experience, treating acute ligament sprains in a dancer's foot and ankle should include the following standard protocols: rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) for the first two days. Thereafter, the unique requirements of the dance profession require treatment that varies from what is normally prescribed for other patient populations with ligament sprains. 
<P>For aesthetic reasons, a majority of dancers are unable to wear ankle braces while dancing. To be on stage in tights and leotards with a big bulky ankle brace is just not feasible. Not only would the dancer not wear the brace, most likely the artistic staff would not allow it. Likewise, audiences attend dance performances to see the dancers move their feet with grace and amazing articulation. Thus, to limit the motion of a dancer's foot with a brace would be more of a problem than, for example, doing likewise to a pitcher's or quaterback's throwing arm. There are exceptions, of course, such as Broadway shows and other types of theatre dance which require costumes that may cover the leg and ankle. Yet, even with these costumes, it may be impossible to wear a brace if it does not fit into the custom shoes usually worn in Broadway shows.
<P>Since bracing is not an acceptable option for most dancers (except during acute stages of the injury and in their street shoes), taping the foot and ankle can help safely transition the dancer back to a full schedule with support. Taping and padding can also be used to help support biomechanical dysfunctions that normally require orthotic intervention, including pronation, supination, and a dropped metatarsal head or cuboid. (A caveat: the dancer's high level of activity requires careful consideration of any return to work plan. A dancer's schedule can include a one to two hour dance class, up to six hours of rehearsals, and then an actual performance.) 
<P>Taping lends discreet support to the dancer with a ligamentis sprain of the foot and ankle. Understandably, if it looks too bulky, the dancer may not wear it; therefore maximum support with a minimum of materials is essential. With taping, the healthcare provider can specifically limit the movements of the dancer depending on the biomechanical evaluation of the foot and ankle. These profession-related problems require the therapist working with dancers to be well versed in ankle taping. 
<P>Here are some basic taping strategies that address three common injuries seen in a performing arts medicine practice. The basic taping principles are the same for all injuries, but taping allows the practitioner to employ the best support system for the injury at hand. Don't forget, support with less is better.

<H2>Taping for a lateral ankle sprain:</H2>
<UL>1. Start with foot in dorsiflexion.

<P>2. Always start with prewrap as this will help avoid any blistering.
<P>3. Using cloth athletic tapes, start with one shin anchor just below the gastroncnemius belly. Then apply two stirrups (pulling tight from medial to lateral) and add one more anchor at the shin.
<P>4. With Elastikon tape do a heel lock with a figure eight action around the heel, then have the patient plantarflex and repeat the figure eight heel lock in the reverse direction.
<P>5. Return the foot to dorsiflexion and close up the rest of the ankle with cloth athletic tape. Be sure there are no spaces in the tape and no wrinkles, as these may cause blistering if excessive.
<P>6. Tape should be flesh colored if possible. The dancers, however, can use make-up to color and fine-tune it to their skin tone.</UL> 

<H2>Taping an inferior tibiofibular ligament sprain:</H2>
<UL>Use the same taping as for a lateral ankle sprain.
<P><UL><LI>Add one extra Elastikon wrap around the inferior tibiofibular joint for extra support.</UL></UL>

<H2>Taping for a calcaneocuboid ligament sprain:</H2>
<UL>Same as for lateral ankle sprain.
<P><UL><LI>Use a felt or foam pad cut to the plantar size of the cuboid bone. Place the pad on the plantar aspect of the foot under the cuboid bone, putting on the pre-wrap and tape.
<P><LI>Use the figure eight heel lock to tighten the tape with an eversion tension to help lift and support the cuboid.</UL></UL></UL>

<H2>Taping for a medial (eversion) ankle sprain:</H2>
<UL>Same as for lateral ankle sprain except the tension pull for the ankle stirrups is medial instead of lateral.</UL>

<H2>Rehabilitation Program</H2>
After injury, a rehabilitation program that includes modalities to increase blood flow, muscle reeducation, pain management, and control edema should begin. A therapeutic exercise program also should be started to increase range of motion (ROM), strength, and proprioception. Lastly, the goal of attaining prior level of functioning of the patient should be stressed. 
<P>Rehabilitation goals can be enhanced with functional taping. Taping allows patients a certain level of comfort and safety as they progress through their prescribed strengthening, endurance, ROM, and proprioception program. Early taping intervention can also provide enhancement of ankle awareness to help the patient avoid a reoccurrence of the ankle sprain. Grade three ankle sprains require casting, surgery, or immobile bracing before a rehabilitation program can begin.
<P>Prolonged use of foot and ankle taping, however, can delay full recovery and hinder the end stage rehabilitation program. Why? Patients can become reliant on tape to provide functional support post-healing instead of using their own muscles. Patients should be weaned from using ankle taping as soon as the healthcare provider feels it is safe to do so, depending on the severity of the injury and the patient's activity requirements.
<P>When taping your dance patients, keep in mind the following three factors:
<P><B>Type of Injury.</B> 
<UL>Make sure the taping helps prevent the movements the patient needs to avoid due to injury.</UL>
<P><B>Cost.</B> 
<UL>Patients should only pay for what they need. By using tape sparingly, the dancer also will be better able to afford this type of preventative treatment.</UL>
<P><B>Comfort/Ease of Use.</B> 
<UL>Over time, dancers will let you know which taping applications feel most comfortable and are the least bulky.</UL>

<CENTER>
<H2>Types and Treatment of Ligament Sprains in the Foot and Ankle</H2>
</CENTER>
<P><B>Lateral inversion sprains.</B>  There are three levels of lateral ankle sprains: I, II, and III degree. First and second degree sprains are usually treated conservatively with rest, ice, compression (immobilization), and elevation in the first 24 to 48 hours. Grade III ankle sprains usually require surgical intervention in the dance population.
<P><B>Inferior tibiofibular ligament.</B> This common sprain in dancers may be due to the fact that the trochlear surface of the talus is wider anteriorly. When a dancer lands from a jump and is dorsiflexed and has an inversion strain, the wider trochlear surface imparts an increased stress to the fibula if the anterior talofibular ligament is compromised. This can cause an increased strain on the inferior tibiofibular joint and ligaments.
<P><B>Calcaneocubiod ligament sprains.</B> These sprains are also common in dancers and usually occur in a dancer with an inversion strain when the foot is in extreme plantar flexion. Thus, dancers with a pes cavus foot are more likely to sustain this type of injury. Swelling and pain are located slightly anterior and inferior to the anterior talofibular ligament, and fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal should be ruled out.
<P><B>The Deltoid ligament sprain.</B> Eversion sprains are not as common in the dancer as in other professions. The Deltoid ligament sprain is more commonly seen in dancers with a pes planus foot. As such, flat feet or pronation may be a warning sign of this type of ankle injury.

<H1>The Road Ahead
for Higher O&#38;P Education</H1>

</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>As our healthcare economics system moves toward managed care and costs of academic programs escalate, it becomes increasingly difficult to provide quality care and education. The rigors and necessity of higher education accreditation conflict with the idea that educational systems must streamline and become more cost-effective. Allied health must find a way to reconcile these economic issues with quality education. 

<H2>Trends in Allied Health Education</H2>
Allied health will be redefined for the 21st century. One of the greatest challenges is determining how to educate allied health professionals for the next century's competitive healthcare environment. This is a formidable task: Both the health and education worlds are in a state of crisis. Dramatic change in health practice is not only inevitable, but already upon us. These changes are calling into question the assumptions underlying current models of health professional education, the methods of financing education, the purposes of public accountability (accreditation), and the multicultural nature of the allied health professions. These issues are significant not only for the O&#38;P community but for the entire healthcare workforce in general and allied health in particular.
<P>Approximately 60 percent of the healthcare workforce are allied health workers. They are projected to be one of the fastest growing occupational groups in the 21st century. These workers are strategically positioned to provide curative, tertiary, preventive, and primary care to large numbers of patients and will influence their attitudes regarding the health professions. Managed care coupled with a demand for schools and programs to expand the scientific base of education programs may affect every level of the U.S. education system.
<P>Consider what's happening. The health environment is shifting focus to primary care, preventive services, and health promotion. These new emphases will push medicine out of the corridors of academic health science centers and into community-based service centers. The much-discussed emerging integrated delivery system will demand that allied health workers feel equally at home in acute care, ambulatory, managed care, and home health environments. Moreover, the changing practice environment will require allied health practitioners to work on interdisciplinary teams and become comfortable with electronic learning. Teachers will be required to employ so-called distance learning to reach students in community settings.
<P>Moreover, the new market-oriented and market-driven health delivery system of the '90s is already forcing both the healthcare and education industries to transform into entrepreneurial operations. This transformation focuses on accountability. The public expectation is that higher education, including orthotic and prosthetic education, must be cost-effective in an openly competitive market economy while maintaining high-quality standards. The critical question for higher education is how to assess and define quality in the self-regulatory process of accreditation and simultaneously gain public confidence and credibility in the quality of its product.
<P>The competitive marketplace is doing something new for most of us: urging the use of a less costly, multi-skilled health professional team. In this environment, the orthotics and prosthetics field will be required to reexamine its curriculum and develop a built-in career ladder. This should encourage professional collaboration and include career advancement incentives. Finally, the leadership of the varying professions must develop a model scope of practice regulations based upon proven outcomes and effectiveness for cost-conscious competitive marketplace incentives.

<H2>Challenges Facing O&#38;P Programs</H2>
With the changing environment, allied health professions struggle to maintain their educational programs. O&#38;P is no exception. Program funding is a critical issue many O&#38;P programs face year to year. Currently, higher tuition and clinical service are the primary sources of program funding, in addition to some limited state or federal monies. Without a doubt, programs that depend upon federal grants face a bleak future. Educational program survivability will depend upon its ability to generate its own income. Some programs rely on higher tuition rates--about $10,000 for certificate programs. But state baccalaureate programs cannot deviate from established tuition fees. Some hospital-based programs limit enrollment and use students to help generate income. Other programs rely on faculty to provide a clinical practice on-site and funnel generated revenues back into the O&#38;P program.
<P>The opportunity to practice attracts faculty and is a necessary experience for educators, but it can present problems when attempting to satisfy the demands of both the classroom and clinic. Programs involved in patient care require faculty members to perform two jobs: educate students and ensure the financial security of their program through clinical practice. 
<P>In 1993, the National Commission on Orthotic and Prosthetic Education (NCOPE) adopted guidelines for new program structures. The patient contact portion of the curriculum can be shifted into a formalized residency, thereby making programs less expensive. Or, a program could offer the didactic portion of the curriculum on campus and use area laboratories to provide hands-on clinical education. Programs could implement alternative learning tools, patient demonstrations, simulations, computer models, and more. With the decreased need for a multitude of orthoses and prostheses, programs could function more cost-effectively.
<P>Attracting faculty is another challenge. Practitioners generally do not explore teaching as a career option. Furthermore, educational facilities are unable to recruit and compensate faculty at levels comparable to private practices. Experienced faculty members sometimes are forced to seek positions with higher compensation outside the university. 
<P>Finally, research opportunities are an identifiable challenge. Since they typically do not possess advanced degrees, orthotic-prosthetic faculty, with notable exceptions, generally don't initiate and attract funding for research. They do, however, have the opportunity to collaborate on projects. A greater emphasis is being placed on research, at a basic level, in the curricula of the primary education programs and residencies. Only with the understanding of the importance of research and advanced degrees can O&#38;P achieve full recognition as a profession.

<H2>Accreditation and O&#38;P</H2>
Accreditation is a system of recognizing educational institutions and professional programs that meet the minimum standards in preparing students for practice. The system of accreditation is key to ensuring that education remains fundamentally sound, responsible, responsive, and effective, thereby providing for public confidence in the integrity and quality of educational programs. For allied health professions, including O&#38;P, accreditation ensures consistency of professional and educational standards; it lays a foundation for quality assurance for professional standards; and it establishes a base for public trust.
<P>For educational institutions and programs, accreditation also serves a valuable role. Programs benefit from the self-evaluation and self-directed improvement provided by the accreditation process.
<P>Accreditation also motivates programs to learn about and comply with consistent national standards. It inaugurates a dialogue between professionals in the field and academic institutions on the basic standards of course content, administrative procedures, patient management, design and fabrication of systems, pertinent engineering principles, interaction with other members of allied health teams, problem solving, relevant clinical research, and other salient issues. 
<P>O&#38;P has a history of developing voluntary accreditation standards. In 1972, the profession created the Educational Accreditation Commission (EAC) to confront the profession's need for an accreditation process. That same year, the EAC set out to establish criteria for assessing and comparing existing curricula for O&#38;P. The commission developed the first set of "Essentials for the Orthotist and Prosthetist" at the baccalaureate and certificate program levels. As O&#38;P matured as a profession, so too did its educational and accreditation processes. In 1991, the EAC was reorganized and restructured into the NCOPE. NCOPE developed a new set of "essentials" reflecting the need for more flexibility in educational programming and the growing technological developments in the field. 
<P>NCOPE pursued and received recognition for O&#38;P as an allied health profession in 1992 by the American Medical Association. With this national recognition, NCOPE qualified for membership in the nationally recognized allied health accreditation agency, the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP). CAAHEP is recognized by two vital bodies: the Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation (CORPA), a national, nonprofit, private-sector organization that recognizes nongovernmental accrediting agencies in postsecondary education; and the U.S. Department of Education (DOE), a federal agency authorized by federal statute to publish a list of accrediting agencies and associations recognized as reliable authorities on educational quality.
<P>Accreditation, the demand for multi-skilled health professionals, managed care, lack of government support--how will allied health education blend these concepts together for the future? The quality of education delivered to the student and the quality of health care offered to the public rely on how allied health professionals and educational programs answer these questions.

<H1>Ski Boot Dynamics and Custom Orthoses</H1>
<P><I>by Jeffrey S. Rich, C.Ped and Greg Hoffman, C.Ped</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>The biomechanics of skiing require the practitioner to treat the leg, orthosis, foot, and ski boot as a single unit.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>Last spring, <CITE>Skiing Trade News</CITE>, in conjunction with <CITE>Ski Magazine</CITE> and Master Fit University, sponsored Sports Balance 2000, a research study on stance issues. The <CITE>Ski Magazine</CITE> Boot Test Camp, with access to elite athletes and more than 200 different pairs of boots, was our laboratory.
<P>Our study goals included answers to the following questions: Are there particular brands or models that work better for a knock-kneed or bowlegged skier? Are there boots that are better for supinators or pronators? What role does the boot's center seam play in the balance equation? And, what effect does the boot cuff have on balance and performance? (See <A HREF="#diagram">diagram</A> below.)
<P>Using a group of exceptional everyday skiers, including former World Cup racers and top instructors, we had each subject try various boots several times. We recorded their personal impressions and empirical stance data using commercial canting devices.
<P>Testers initially skied each boot with stock insoles. The second time out we substituted their existing custom, weightbearing footbeds with full-blown orthoses with forefoot control and, if necessary, added toe/heel lifts and underbinding cants. Our goal was to create ideal ski balance: a flat ski with the knee in a slight A-framed position.

<H2>The Results</H2>
<B>The cuff is the boot's key control center.</B> While other variables held constant, testers consistently experienced greater differences in their skiing depending on whether their boot cuffs fit snugly or loosely. The snugger the fit, the quicker the boot. Our study ranked fit zones in the following order of importance: cuff, Achilles tendon region, heel pocket, instep/shin, forefoot shape, and toe box.
<P><B>A cuff cant is crucial to proper balance.</B> A cuff cant is the single most important feature on a boot. If the cuff doesn't match the lower leg shape, the ski will not sit flat on the snow. For skiers with excessive tibial varum, it was impossible to create a balanced stance in boots without a cuff cant adjuster. Sanmarco's Symflex is clearly the best canting system, followed by designs with adjustments on both sides of the ankles.
<P><B>The higher the cuff the more of an impact on stance alignment.</B> In fact, some skiers could not be aligned properly in boots with a tall cuff. High cuff proved to be a major problem for skiers with extreme tibial varum or valgum. A high-rising cuff on a bowlegged skier hits the curve in the lower leg, making it difficult--if not impossible--to achieve a significant cuff cant. The result? The skier catches his or her outside edge.
<P><B>Transverse plane deformities wreak havoc on the center seam.</B> The center seam on a ski boot is anything <I>but</I> centered. The foot has a theoretical balance line that bisects the center of the heel and runs through the center of the second toe. Most ski boot "center seams" actually are between one and two degrees inside of center. This results in an abducted stance with the foot mass being outside of center. The outside center position prevents pronation and balances the knock-kneed skier somewhat, but makes it much more difficult to achieve an ideal balance for bowlegged skiers. Since all boots have an abducted stance, a skier with an abducted stance will ride his outside edges. Stretching and/or removing liner material changes the center line on the boot and in many cases makes the skier perform better.
<P><B>Skiers with extreme frontal plane deformities are in trouble.</B> A slight knock-kneed stance is a plus for skiing because it puts the knee over the inside edge of the ski, allowing for quicker turn initiations. An unbalanced knock-kneed stance causes the skier to ride the inside edges. Bowlegged skiers, conversely, will ride the outside edges. When it comes to skiing it's better to be knock-kneed than bowlegged. Measurements of more than 3 degrees of tibia varum are considered excessive. These skiers should always opt for boots with dual cuff cants or a Sanmarco model with Symflex. An extreme bowleg or knock-kneed stance, however, is a detriment and requires cuff canting, foot/orthoses, and possible underbinding cants.
<P><B>Toe lifts and/or heel lifts can significantly improve balance.</B> Lifts, placed under the toe of the bindings or under the heel, are proving to be a boon to recreational skiers since they help improve fore/aft balance. In some cases, we were able to improve skier balance with toe lifts, eliminating "pot belly" and hunched over stances. Again, the amount of toe lift need varied by model.
<P><B>Limited ankle dorsiflexion in skiing can stunt ski skill growth.</B> Limited dorsiflexion of the knee, ankle joint, functional and/or forefoot equinus hinders balance and performance greatly. The flexibility of the ankle joint--the ability to drive the knee forward over the toes--helps determine the appropriate boot stiffness and the amount of heel lift necessary to balance the fore/aft stance.
<P>Minimal ankle dorsiflexion in some ski boots is 8-10 degrees; and that is just for stand, no flexing (see Ideal ski stance). Most boots have between 12-16 degrees of total forward lean. Total forward lean angle is the sum of the ramp angle (6-8 degrees) minus the forward lean of rear cuff (9-14 degrees).
<P>A skier with less than 12 degrees can get immediate performance improvement with a heel lift. For a foot with a low or normal instep, heel lifts center the body mass over the foot while relieving tension on tight calves. A skier with a high instep may not have enough room in the boots for heel lifts. In that case, the bindings may be moved to position the boot a half to full inch forward of the standard mounting point on the ski.
<P><B>Leg length discrepancies are common and must be corrected for proper stance.</B> We were surprised to find that nearly half of our subjects had one short leg. The largest length discrepancy was 1/2 inch. We found that without correctly lifting the short leg, ideal stance alignment was not possible. As little as a 1/8-inch discrepancy can affect balance. For differences greater than 1/2-inch, underbinding lifters should be installed.
<P><B>Orthoses make a big difference.</B> Boot performance often went from mediocre to excellent with the addition of orthoses. As underfoot support was increased, from stock insole to custom footbed to custom orthosis, so did overall comfort, control, and performance. Orthoses greatly enhanced skiing posture, sometimes eliminating the need for canting.
<P>Since the heel bone is the "control center" for proper foot balance, problems here greatly affect stance. The calcaneal stance position helps determine the degree of pronation and supination.
<P>The preferred calcaneal stance for skiing is 2 to 4 degrees of valgus. Measurements outside this range indicated a need for orthoses. The orthoses should maintain a calcaneal stance just shy of perpendicular to the ground. The calcaneal stance less than 2 degrees of valgus may result in catching an outside edge while more than 5 degrees of valgus may make it difficult for the skier to get off his inside edge.
<P>All forefoot imbalance should be corrected to achieve optimal stance alignment. Without posting the forefoot it was nearly impossible to keep the knee tracking straight. With the addition of a forefoot post (when needed) the dynamics of the turn were constant and rhythmic.
<P>Like being slightly knock-kneed, we also discovered that a slight forefoot valgus is a plus for skiing. With the orthotic forefoot posted, the valgus stance helps position the knee medially, increasing leverage power to the inside edge of the ski. (Note: Before installing an orthosis into a ski boot check that there is no varus or arch support built into the plastic shellbed. If there is, grind it flat.)
<P>Interestingly, our test subjects--all tremendously accomplished skiers--felt significant improvement after undergoing their intensive balance sessions. Our coaching observers also noted marked improvements in every case. We also did some placebo testing, setting some of our skiers off balance to see if they'd notice. They all came in whining like first time ski kids.
<P>Remember, the biomechanical needs of skiers are dramatically different from those of gait sports athletes and go far beyond just constructing an orthosis. The leg, orthosis, foot, and ski boot must function together as a unit. Rigid or over-corrected orthoses often are not tolerated. The skier's optimal stance is slightly knock-kneed with at least 14 degrees of dorsiflexion. A good specialty ski shop should understand the performance tuning protocol, the skier's needs, and the biomechanics of the ski boot. So should any practitioner serving a skiing patient.
<P>Before attempting to install a ski orthosis ask yourself these questions. Do you know how to adjust the cuff cant? Forward lean? The position to mount the bindings? Which center seam is best? How much heel or toe lift is needed? Do you even know which boot fits the foot the best? If you can't answer any of these questions, seek some boot fitting knowledge or align yourself with a C.Ped. or ski shop specializing in ski boot dynamics. Placing an orthotic device in a ski boot without checking the boot's alignment may offer little benefit and can move the skier even further out of alignment or even cause injury.

<P><I>The ideal skier stance: From the sagittal plane, there should be no pressure on the front or rear of the boot's cuff. A lateral view reveals that the center of the shoulder, hips, and ankle bisect in a vertical line. The center of the knee joint bisects the ball of the foot. From the front, the skier should be naturally assuming a slight knock-kneed stance of 1 to 2 degrees.</I>

Forefoot Pathology with Prefabricated Metatarsal Longitudinal Arch Supports</TITLE></HEAD>

<H1>Treating 
Forefoot Pathology with Prefabricated Metatarsal Longitudinal Arch Supports</H1>
<P><I>by Thomas H. Lee, MD; Sheldon Lin, MD; &#38; Zach Ruhl, CP</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Many common forefoot abnormalities can be treated with prefabricated metatarsal supports.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>Historically, external shoe modifications have been the mainstay of treatment for forefoot conditions. Generally, these leather modifications--made of one-eighth inch to three-sixteenths inch lifts--were positioned on the outer sole of the shoe. Although metatarsal bars remain common, devices such as the Denver heel, Hauser comma bars, and Nutt wedges began to lose their sense of efficacy--not because they did not work but because they became unsightly in adulthood.
<P>Internal shoe modifications allowed for multiple corrections and the use of several materials interchangeable from shoe to shoe. Initial rigid arch supports were constructed of steel. The Whitman support or the more comfortable Shaffer plate were occasionally helpful in childhood, and less so in adulthood.
<P>More malleable prefabricated orthoses evolved as newer, softer, and more comfortable materials provided increased ease of use and comfort. Mixtures of rubber and cork gave way to present day high-tech plastic hybrids.
<P>Due to the rising costs in construction of sophisticated internal supports, prefabricated devices are often helpful in the initial treatment of common forefoot deformities. For conditions involved in overload forces (e.g., intractable plantar keratosis, metatarsalgia, or interdigital neuroma), several off-the-shelf devices can initially stabilize the condition.
<P>Overload can exist in the forefoot from several anatomic considerations. The 1st metatarsal is shorter in approximately 60 percent of the population. The mobility of the 1st metatarsocuneiform joint determines the amount of weightbearing on the 1st ray. The plantar aponeurosis brings about plantar flexion of the 1st ray but in several pathologic conditions, such as bunion deformities, this does not occur efficiently. As a result, forces are transferred to the 2nd ray, causing an overload condition. The 2nd and 3rd metatarsals are quite stable because of the rigid-locking tarsometatarsal joint. As a result, any hypermobility of their neighboring rays will overload these metatarsal heads. An equinus position will abnormally transfer forces from the hindfoot to the forefoot. Cavus feet will decrease the overall surface area of the foot and any abnormal alignment of the metatarsophalangeal joints secondary to subluxation or dislocation, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, will expose these metatarsal heads to high pressure points.
<P>Simple forefoot or lesser toe conditions are amenable to the judicious use of moleskin. Tape and prefabricated slings can be used as sleeves or braces for minor forefoot deformities. The shoe must be large enough to accommodate these appliances if the patient is to remain comfortable. 
<P>Prefabricated longitudinal arch supports have several distinct advantages in treating forefoot pathology. As their name implies, they originally are designed to support the longitudinal arch in the area of the midfoot. With careful placement, however, they can effectively off-load focal areas of pressure in the forefoot by altering the weightbearing load pattern. Peak pressures are centered in the metatarsal head area from approximately 30 to 55 percent of the walking cycle. In addition, the forefoot is also subjected to medial and lateral shear forces as well as torque forces at toe-off. These forces during a running cycle can easily exceed three times a person's body weight.
<P>The distinct advantages of prefabricated longitudinal metatarsal supports are their easy availability and inexpensive cost. They are available from several manufacturers and are easily accessible to patients. The initial placement of the pad is done in the office. Patients are given a careful explanation of how the pad functions to alter the weightbearing forces on their feet. Placement of the pad is facilitated by observing the patient's insoles. Areas of high pressure such as keratoses will form a dark stain in the insole and the pad is placed just proximal to this spot. A common error is to place the pad on the area of high pressure or to randomly place it in the forefoot. This error generally exacerbates the patient's condition. Frequently, the shoe will not be able to accept the new pad and a modification to a lace-up shoe or Blucher-type is necessary. A Spenco-type liner is a convenient addition that allows the pads to be interchangeable from shoe to shoe.
<P>The goal of all orthoses is to allow for smooth transference of weightbearing with a soft heel strike and a smooth roll-off. In many common forefoot abnormalities, prefabricated metatarsal supports are an inexpensive and effective intervention.

<H2>Longitudinal Metatarsal Arch Pads</H2>
The Longitudinal Metatarsal Arch Pad is the original Hapad. This pad inspired the development of Hapad's complete line of natural wool felt foot products. A combination metatarsal and scaphoid pad, it provides a comfortable correction that permits natural foot flexibility so the arches strengthen and orthotic dependence is reduced. Available in five thicknesses: 5/16-, 3/8-, 7/16-, 1/2- and 9/16-inch.

Metatarsal pads are common--offered in some form by the vendors listed below and others. However, metatarsal longitudinal arch pads are far less common, and some of those listed below do not carry them. Practitioners should identify exactly which type of pad is needed for the patient's therapy, and order accordingly.

<H1>The ADT Network</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>The granddaddy of the networks is still growing.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>There is only one true network of automated orthotic labs. By network, I mean a group of independently-owned and operated labs that subscribe to a single orthotic CAD-CAM technology and are in fact prepared to back each other up in the event of a local fabrication problem. That network is the ADT Network, named for Yorba Linda, California-based American Digital Technology. At least nine licensees operate within the ADT Network: Creative Orthotic Laboratory, Earthwalk Orthotics Laboratory, Gulf Biomechanical Laboratory, M-Tech Laboratory, Piedmont Orthotic Laboratory, Plus Laboratory, Rocky Mountain Orthotics Laboratory, one government facility, and a lab in Northern Ireland. The status of Bloch Orthotic Lab as part of the network is yet to be determined.
<P>Together, ADT's American labs serve a growing practitioner base of thousands, which by year's end may be generating as many as 7,000 to 8,000 custom devices per month, according to an ADT estimate given to <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>. If the ADT Network enjoys even modest growth next year, the network may be responsible for more than 100,000 annual devices on the low side, and perhaps double that number if additional hoped-for licensees sign on. 
<P>Despite ADT's big footprint, most doctors probably aren't aware that their lab is using ADT technology or is even part of some informal coast-to-coast network. The physicians who send their prescriptions to Piedmont, Plus, or any of the others have developed a relationship with their particular lab, and generally have done so long before the lab adopted the ADT system. Even labs that opened their doors once enabled by the ADT system, such as Bloch Orthotic Laboratory and Earthwalk, attract clientele based on their own merits, not on the ADT brand name. That's because ADT licensees are nothing close to franchisees. Each lab is fiercely independent, each has its own distinct signature and identity, both in terms of business and orthotic philosophy. And each is fighting for competitive market share--even as they cooperate.
<P>The ADT system, known as Ortho-Cam, is essentially transparent to the practitioner. He sends negative casts to his chosen lab. The lab digitizes the cast electromagnetically using a wand digitizer that looks much like a pen. Unlike a laser scanner that emits a light, the ADT cast digitizer takes a direct contact measurement by mapping more than 1,000 positions on the cast using eight standard anatomical reference points. 
<P>To digitize the cast, the lab technician simply sweeps over the cast surface with the wand. The measured areas are graphically displayed on the monitor, so if any spots are missed, another sweep gobbles them up. An experienced lab tech can sweep a cast within about 90 seconds, says an ADT engineer.
<P>There is a right way and a wrong way to digitize. ADT trains licensee technicians to avoid incorrect sweeping styles, such as using two hands. A rainbow of orthotic corrections can be done prior to milling. ADT says its software can also "grow the orthosis" for pediatric patients up to three sizes without redigitizing.
<P>Once the cast is digitized, the independent lab has the choice of direct CAD-CAM milling or creating a positive intermediary for more traditional fabrication means. A common misconception is that the ADT system is confined to polypropylene. Although a large percentage of devices created by ADT labs are indeed milled from flexible polypropylene, the system is capable of fabricating a spectrum of devices out of almost any material--rigid, flexible, or accommodative. More ADT labs will soon be opting for this expanded capability.
<P>For milling, labs either maintain their own on-site miller or modem the information to ADT's central fabrication facility in California or to another cooperating network lab. Piedmont, for example, maintains its own milling system. Gulf in Texas and McCartney in Northern Ireland modem directly to ADT. Ohio-based Earthwalk, a recent entry in the field, has avoided the expense of acquiring a miller by modeming its datacasts to Rocky Mountain Orthotics. 
<P>In turn, Howard Hillman, owner of Rocky Mountain says, "If our mill goes down we are backed up by ADT itself, or any other licensee." The same goes for cast digitizers. If one lab's digitizing system goes down, it could ship its casts to another network lab or to ADT itself for digitizing. ADT also maintains a spare digitizer on hand ready to ship if a lab system goes down. 
<P>In a nutshell, ADT means backup. In the event of a catastrophic event, such as a fire or massive computer failure, any individual lab can turn to the network. Ironically, this is not as novel as it sounds. There are many quiet fulfillment arrangements in place between old-line manual custom labs where one lab with lower cost and excess capacity will fabricate devices for another manual lab that is either maxxed or has found an economic advantage in doing so.
<P>The ADT system has certainly proved its flexibility in that it is fueling the completely diverse orthotic and business styles of so many labs. Piedmont was an old-line family-owned manual lab with a tradition of old-fashioned craftsmanship. Creative was originally a local manual lab known as Valley West in its pre-ADT days. Plus Orthotic Lab, the successor to the old Paragon, prides itself on being a CAD-CAM animal. Gulf Biomechanical operates an O&#38;P shop using Seattle CAD-CAM technology for prostheses, and employs ADT technology just for foot orthoses. Bloch Orthotic Laboratory evolved from a well-entrenched local pedorthic and orthotic service. Earthwalk, the newest addition to the network, married the academic polymer knowledge of owner Susan Boren to the biomechanical enabling of the ADT system. Diversity is the hallmark of the network.
<P>However, one commonality many of the labs share is the ability to break out of their small local lab identity using CAD-CAM technology and the global ADT mindset. Piedmont, Creative, Rocky Mountain, and Bloch were all small local or regional operations until they automated. Adopting ADT technology eliminated the years and resources needed to establish a national following. "Automation took 60 percent of the cost out of our manual production," says Dave McAninch, part-owner of Piedmont. 
<P>As a result, labs can focus more resources on advertising and marketing, taking advantage in many cases of their trendy and marketable niche in automation. Labs such as Bloch and Rocky Mountain have established national client lists by using automation as a calling card. With automation comes the fast turnaround efficiencies of a well-honed operation normally years in the making. Moreover, there is a market payoff in the discounts derived from a CAD-CAM fabricating system that doesn't take a lunch break or collect health benefits.
<P>What could make the ADT Network an indisputable orthotic powerhouse would be the successful introduction of ADT's years-delayed office scanner, the BioScan. After years of broken delivery date promises, ADT is tight-lipped about release dates or details, but <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> has learned that ADT is now targeting year's end to release a $5,000 scanner. A so-called Partnership Program will reduce the cost to $1,500 if the practice satisfies a volume requirement. ADT is hoping to sell 100 units by next summer. Many have seen ADT's delivery promises come and go in the past. The most credible part of BioScan's possible delivery is ADT's refusal to hype or entice <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> with vaporous announcements. Further details will appear in <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> only after the long-delayed, oft-revised BioScan actually appears and proves it can work.
<P>Nonetheless, the mere promise of the scanner is a scintillating notion to the licensees. Imagine an office-based scanner that instantly creates its own open architecture standard by virtue of compatibility with nine or more labs. Moreover, ADT President Michael Grumbine promises to open his standard up to all other players in the industry.
<P>"A scanner would benefit us and our doctors tremendously," says Piedmont's McAninch. "Our volume users would have better turnaround. Quality would improve twofold: casting errors would be eliminated, and the doctor would have the responsibility to fill out the prescription because we would only get what is on our monitor."
<P>One leading distraction to the fulfillment of ADT's potential is the constellation of litigation that has surrounded those associated with ADT and its network--more than even a seasoned reporter can keep track of without a scorecard. Over recent years, there has been litigation by and against former employees, ADT management groups, and licensees dealing with issues of patent infringement, slander, management, and ownership. What's more, there has been contemplation of future suits that might outshadow anything to date. All totalled, legal fees and expenses from all the parties certainly must rank in the strong six-digit realm. Hours and hours have been devoted to depositions, testimonies, trials, arbitrations, and aggravation. Just before we went to press, one network lab official not even a party to a suit made two transcontinental trips within one month to testify in a proceeding. 
<P>But by the time this issue of <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> reaches readers, a large part of the litigation may be resolved. Major arbitration and settlement efforts are underway with leading licensee and management litigants. "There's nothing more I want to see than peaceful waters," says ADT's Grumbine. "But we have issues we have to resolve, and we must defend our patents and defend our technology." Piedmont's McAninch conceded all the litigation is indeed a distraction, but hoped it would come to a close. "ADT is the best system I know," he says. "But will it remain the best system? All the litigation is distracting from the updates and the technology. I'll be happy when it ends."
<P>Jeff Bloch, owner of Bloch Orthotic Labs and one of the litigants, commented that once litigation ended, more of the network can concentrate on the market. "Grumbine has a track record in automation. If the scanner comes out, it would create its own imperative. He might be able to capture the market. I would consider upgrading my system and working with him. I have confidence in him."
<P>The fact that ADT has persevered and continually added new licensees, and the fact that its leading labs have prospered--despite all its problems--is testimony to the staying power of ADT technology and its network. For the biomechanics mainstream, its agenda for ADT is a short one: more technology, more economy, more efficacy, and more access to orthotic automation.

<H1>In-House Fabrication 
of Temporary Orthoses</H1>
<P><I>by Skip Hunter, PT, ATC</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Not only quick and inexpensive, in-house temporary orthoses also are a valuable evaluation tool in the fabrication of permanent orthoses.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>In-house fabrication of temporary orthoses offers several advantages: it can be done quickly, the devices are usually inexpensive, and most are easily adjusted. The drawbacks are that they often do not provide the control some patients demand and the materials used may not be very durable.
<P>There are many ways to fabricate temporary orthoses in your office: the choices are as numerous as the number of different materials available. In my practice, I base my decision of technique on the ease of working with a particular material and the relative speed at which the materials bond at low temperatures. I prefer placing the patient in a non-weightbearing position, which doesn't require special equipment such as foam trays or pillows. This position also provides better access to the foot and ankle and allows the patient to remain neutral during the molding process. The actual molding of the material can be performed on a treatment table or plinth. 
<P>Two pieces of heat moldable thermoplastic (Aliplast 10, buff of 1/8- inch thickness and Plastazote #2 of 1/4-inch thickness) are cut out of their respective sheets in a rectangular shape slightly larger than the shape and size of the foot. These two pieces are then placed in a preheated oven at approximately 300 degrees. The Aliplast is placed on top of the Plastazote. At this temperature the two pieces will soften and bond in approximately two minutes.
<P>During this time, the patient is placed prone with the knee bent to a 90 degree angle. The ankle is placed in neutral and the foot is protected by a thick sock or stockinette. Subtalar neutral is determined by palpation as the patient is maintained in this prone position.
<P>The thermoplastic is removed from the oven after the two materials bond and become moldable. Practitioners should protect their hands by wearing gloves. A mask is also recommended since some smoke is created as the two substances bond. The contour of the foot is then captured as the neutral position is maintained. The practitioner's hands should use enough force to hold neutral and at the same time mold the material to the arch, forefoot, and rearfoot. This position is held for approximately one minute for the materials to become firm enough to hold the shape of the foot.
<P>Next, the patient is seated and the foot is placed onto the material so that it follows the contour of the materials. The outline of the foot is traced onto the material so that it ends at the toe sulcus. This outline of the foot is then cut out of the materials. The final process consists of grinding the orthosis so that it fits the shoe and at the same time maintains the foot in neutral. This grinding produces dust, necessitating eye protection, a mask, and a covering for the practitioner's clothes. The first grind bevels the outside edges of the Plastazote at approximately 20 degrees, allowing a good fit in the shoe. Following this, the front edge of the orthosis is trimmed back to the level of the metatarsal heads. Next, the bottom of the orthosis is ground so that it is flat. An experienced practitioner can incorporate posts on the forefoot or rearfoot by selectively grinding more or less Plastazote from the bottom. The front edge of the orthosis is bevelled very thin so that the patient cannot feel the end of the orthosis under the metatarsal heads. Additional support may be added by gluing another piece of Plastazote under the arch. This arch cookie should be crescent moon-shaped so that it fills the arch area. After the glue dries, this area may be ground flat so that it matches the contour of the rest of the bottom of the orthosis.
<P>Modifications such as forefoot and rearfoot posts, metatarsal pads, heel lifts, and sesamoid pads are easily added to temporary orthoses. They may be added by using self-adhering felt to locate the correct area on the orthosis for maximum comfort and relief. Once the proper area of relief is located, a more permanent material may be used to replace the felt. Nickelplast, firmer Plastazote, or Aliplast may be glued in place of the original felt. I often allow the patient several days of trial with the felt before changing to more permanent materials.
<P>Special adaptions may be necessary for patients with unusual problems. Diabetic and rheumatoid feet may require softer orthotic material and longer, full-length orthoses. In these cases, softer materials are used and the orthosis is left at full-length rather than trimmed at the metatarsal heads.
<P>As a finishing touch, a covering may be added to the top of the orthosis. My usual choice is Spenco, although several commercial products similar to this material are available. A covering may prevent orthotic movement in the shoe, increase patient comfort, add shock absorption, and increase the attractiveness of the orthosis.
<P>In-house temporary orthoses are a cost effective, time efficient, and comfortable way to address many lower extremity problems. While temporary orthoses may not be a final solution to a problem, they can be a valuable evaluation tool. These short-term orthoses may assess the need for longer lasting orthoses and, in the hands of an experienced practitioner, a temporary orthosis may also provide information about proper positioning and special modifications. This information may be tried out in a temporary orthosis before solutions are incorporated into a permanent orthosis, saving the patient time and expense.

<H1>Diabetic Hosiery: 
Playing Soft and Loose with the Facts</H1>
<P><I>by Douglas H. Richie, Jr., DPM</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Diabetic patients should wear low-compression acrylic, not cotton, socks that maintain shape, resist compression or bunching, and remain soft.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>Less than 10 percent of diabetics in the U.S. wear professionally-fitted additional depth or custom footwear. The other 90 percent buy their shoes in athletic shoe stores, department stores, or through mail order catalogs. A review of consumer-oriented medical mail order catalogs shows an alarming number of foot care products targeted to diabetic patients. Of greater concern are the claims made about the health benefits of these products. Misrepresentation of scientific facts concerning specifications and potential benefits of therapeutic hosiery is not only propagated in consumer advertisements and catalogs but is pervasive within the medical community.
<P>Although erroneous, the following statement may actually be true: "Made of 100 percent cotton fibers which doctors recommend." Without any formal training in footwear and hosiery products, doctors often fall into the trap of propagating myths about socks. For example, "White cotton socks are healthy." This statement couldn't be further from the truth. While dyes can be allergenic and harmful, cotton is truly inferior to newer synthetic fibers in therapeutic hosiery construction. 
<P>Unlike other parts of the body exposed to open ambient air, the human foot is encased in a closed container, the shoe. Hydrophilic fibers such as cotton and wool can absorb moisture and then allow evaporation--although slowly--when worn as apparel in the form of shirts, pants, and gloves. Inside the shoe, movement of moisture known as "wicking" becomes more important than absorption. Hydrophobic fibers such as acrylic will wick moisture two and a half times faster than cotton, facilitating delivery of moisture to the shoe upper for evaporation. Hydrophilic cotton fibers trap moisture inside the shoe and against the skin of the foot. This moisture enhances microbial colonization on the skin and increases skin susceptibility to breakdown from shearing forces. Newer, high-tech synthetic fibers such as CoolMax, ThermoStat, and Akwatek have cross-sectional variations to increase surface area for wicking, while reducing heat build-up commonly experienced in pure acrylic socks.
<P>Admittedly, when autonomic neuropathy affects people with diabetes, sweating in the feet is decreased or absent. But cotton fiber socks should still be avoided because these fibers compress more easily, lose shape, and bunch up when compared to high-tech synthetic fiber socks. Additionally, cotton fiber socks become abrasive with pilling after repeated wash-and-wear cycles. These mechanical deficiencies of cotton can lead to increased friction and skin injury in diabetic patients.
<P>Here is another myth: "Non-binding oversized socks help promote circulation." A nonbinding sock is often a formless bag of fabric that slips off the leg and into the shoe, creating a wrinkled foreign object that can cause skin injury. Furthermore, fear of the sock impeding arterial inflow is unfounded.
<P>Studies have shown that high-quality athletic socks with elastic crew uppers provide between 9 and 12mm Hg pressure. This amount of compression is significantly less than what is used in prescription compression hosiery designed for venous insufficiency. Yet research has shown that a low level of compression (9-12 mm Hg) not only improves venous function but does not compromise arterial inflow. The elastic compression used in high-quality hosiery is necessary at low ranges to provide fit, enhance venous return and optimal arterial inflow. An abrupt elastic seam at the top of the crew can cause skin injury. Seamless, hemmed crew uppers--especially those that drop out all elastic at the very top--are recommended to avoid leaving a characteristic depression in the skin.
<P>Several studies published during the past decade have documented that hosiery with dense padding can reduce plantar pressures by up to 30 percent and continue providing these protective benefits for up to six months. Subsequent F-Scan studies demonstrated that padded athletic socks offer significant pressure relief inside the shoe as compared to conventional dress socks.
<P>To reduce pressure against the skin of the foot, sock products must be significantly thicker than conventional hosiery. This presents a shoe-fitting dilemma. As mentioned above, the padded sports sock demonstrates significant pressure relief, but it can also increase shoe size requirements by a full size and a half. For the unknowing patient who is not properly fit, these thicker hosiery products can pose a greater risk than any protective benefit.
<P>An alternative to extremely thick padded sports hosiery products is the newer shear-reducing sock systems designed not only to reduce direct pressure against the skin but also to mitigate the tangentially applied shearing forces thought to be the primary contributor to skin injury in diabetic patients.
<P>The U.S. Army has conducted the most extensive research yet on hosiery products and their ability to reduce skin injury on soldiers' feet. They discovered that the most effective sock systems include a thinner CoolMax-type liner with an outer layer of sock composed of moderately padded acrylic or wool. These sock systems require that the terry loops of the padding not come into direct contact with the skin surface. 

<H2>Recommendations &#38; Conclusions</H2>

<H1>Force vs. Pressure</H1>
<P><I>by by Eric Fuller, DPM</I>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>Two terms, force and pressure, are often confused. Understanding the distinction between the two is important to understanding mechanical stress on body structures. In some instances, force is more important; in others pressure is. 
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Force.</FONT></B> First understand where force comes from. When you are standing on the surface of the Earth, not one but two forces are involved. The first is the force of gravity, the mutually attractive force between two bodies. In this case, it is the mutually attractive force between the Earth and a body. The second force is ground reaction force. Newton's second law states that the net force acting on a body is equal to its mass times its acceleration. Unless opposed by ground reaction force, gravity would cause a body to fall toward the center of the Earth. The ground applies a force equal and opposite to the force of gravity, so the net force on the stationary body is zero. Ground reaction force keeps things from falling toward the center of the Earth.
<P>Two factors affect the magnitude of ground reaction force. The first is the pull of gravity: the greater the mass of the individual, the greater the force of gravity, the greater the ground reaction force. The second factor is the acceleration--upward or downward--of the body. Imagine a person standing on a long flexible board supported on both ends, but not its middle. When the person is just standing, the board is flexed a constant amount. This flex comes from the constant pull of gravity. The person then flexes and extends his knees, and bounces on the board. Flexion and extension of the knees will accelerate the body up and down and alter the force applied to the board. The board bends more when more force is applied, and it bends less when less force is applied.
<P>The effects of up and down acceleration can be seen on total ground reaction force in walking. During walking, the body reaches its highest vertical point when it is directly over a single limb. The body then falls forward and down toward the next step and reaches its lowest vertical point when both feet are on the ground and the body is directly between the two feet. When the body's height changes, it must be accelerated up or down by changes in the amount of ground reaction force. In gait, the force-versus-time curve exhibits a typical two-humped pattern. The first hump occurs as weight is transferred from the trailing foot on the foot that is being measured, and the body is accelerated upward from its lowest point. This hump will reach a magnitude above body weight (typically 5-15 percent above body weight in walking and higher in running). As the body approaches its highest point, it is decelerating and ground reaction force will decrease to slightly less than bodyweight (5-10 percent). As the body approaches the lowest point, it must slow down (decelerate) its fall and prepare to rise back up again onto the other leg. Ground reaction force then increases back up above body weight and the second hump of the force-time curve is seen. This typical curve is seen in walking. It may not have this shape in running or jumping, since the accelerations may be different.
<P>Ground reaction force can have a horizontal component as well; this is known as shear. Shear can be linear or rotational, and is generated when the foot pushes off the ground to either accelerate or decelerate horizontal motion. Remember Newton's second law of motion: force is equal to mass times acceleration. When a person starts walking from rest, he is accelerating. The foot pushes against the ground and then the ground pushes back on the foot (Newton's third law: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction). The horizontal push from the ground is what causes the person to start moving when he walks. This shear between the ground and the foot can be demonstrated by walking on a slippery surface and observing the lack of shear caused by insufficient friction with the ground.
<P>Up until this point, the discussion has been about the total force on the entire foot. It is not yet known whether total force causes, or has any correlation with, pathology of the lower extremity. For example, much has been written about how the force at heel impact can equal two to three times body weight. However, it has been calculated that the force between the talus and tibia in a slow jog can equal 11 times body weight, because of muscular compression of the talus and the tibia. (The gastroc pulls the calcaneus up and the tibia down at the same time.) So some parts of the body can easily stand forces that are two to three times body weight. It has been proven, however, that force on a small area in an insensitive foot can lead to ulceration. That brings us to pressure.
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Pressure.</FONT></B> Pressure is equal to force divided by area. The same force applied over an area twice as large will endure half the pressure. The fact that area is involved is very important for the measurement of pressure. Taking the entire force on the foot and dividing that by the total area of contact of the foot would provide very little information. However, pressure can be measured for discrete locations on the plantar surface of the foot. Localized areas of high and low pressure can be identified. Most systems that measure pressure distribution essentially are comprised of numerous small force sensors in an array. It is vital to understand that the value of pressure from a particular sensor depends upon the size of the sensor. For example, a metatarsal head may rest on a single sensor. If that sensor is 1 square centimeter, then the pressure value would be different from a sensor of 1.25 square centimeters--even though the force on the two sensors would be the same. For this reason and others, the values of one pressure measurement system should not be compared with the values measured with another system. In diabetics, localized areas of high pressure have been associated with ulceration. However, it is very difficult to establish a universal value at which an individual foot will ulcerate because it depends upon both the system used and the individual fragility of the foot. 
<P>The goal in treatment of high plantar forces is to shift the force to some other location, because the total force on the foot will remain the same. When force is removed from one location of the foot, it must go somewhere else. The purpose of accommodative insoles is to distribute pressure; that is, increase pressure in areas where it is low and decrease it in locations where it is high. The pressure should be below the threshold for ulceration when there is force evenly distributed across the entire plantar surface of the foot.
<P>Let's review. Force and pressure are related by different factors. Pressure is equal to force divided by the area that the force is applied to. In gait, when one foot is up in the air, the force on the foot on the ground is approximately body weight. The total force on the foot can only be changed by transferring the force to some other structure. The force can be transferred to the arms with the use of crutches, or to the tibial tuberosity with a patellar tendon bearing brace, or if the person decreases his or her mass. 
<P>There is no way to get around gravity. As the bumper sticker says "Gravity--it's not just a good idea, it's the law."

<H1>Running Start</H1>
</CENTER>

<H2>Aerobic riders no better off</H2>
So-called "aerobic riding" machines often fell short when tested against treadmill running, cycling, and skiing machines, according to a recent study by the International Association of Fitness Professionals. When exertion was maintained at the "somewhat hard" level, one method of fitness equipment exercise did not appear superior to any other. However, treadmills, cycles, and skiing machines did yield significantly higher oxygen consumption values and kilocaloric expenditures than did aerobic riding, according to the association. Although aerobic riding was perceived as a "somewhat hard" workout, it was probably muscular systems, not cardiorespiratory systems that were overloaded, states Len Kravitz, PhD, the principal investigator. Ironically, this lack of cardiovascular demand led Kravitz to suggest that such machines might then be helpful to unfit populations who are less capable of high cardiovascular demands.

<H2>Spontaneous achilles ruptures</H2>
A rare complication for patients undergoing flouroquinolone antibiotic treatment has been suggested by Saul Trevino, MD. According to Dr. Trevino, tendinitis or even rupture of the tendon tissue is a rare but possible side effect of using certain antibiotics such as norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin, and ofloxacin. Most patients who suffer these complications generally display other risk factors such as advanced age or kidney failure. Dr. Trevino cites 85 cases of tendinitis by December, 1993 reported to the World Health organization and 17 cases of rupture reported to the FDA by October, 1994. Most occurrences were outside the United States.

<H2><CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> websites</H2>
The <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> Gateway and its 15 derivative specialty home pages together garner approximately 20,000 "hits" per month, according to Brad Kliewer, <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> webmaster. The most frequented site is the Gateway at www.biomech.com/biomech. The second most frequented site is the Physical Therapy Home Page. The least frequented is the Pedorthics Home Page. Kliewer observed that there are some 60,000 physical therapists in America, and only slightly more than 1,000 certified pedorthists. 

<H2>Nourishing legislation</H2>
The American Dietetic Association is working with several dozen senators and congressmen to pass the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act. The ADA maintains that analysis of 2,400 hospital cases revealed an average $8,000 per patient savings with the intervention of medical nutrition therapy. For example, a 1994 study showed that type II diabetics could better control their sugar levels, weight, and cholesterol when proper nutrition was administered by a registered dietician. Therapy can range from simple diet modifications to specialized I V feedings. 
<P>Patients suffering from AIDS, kidney disease, and burns can also benefit, says the ADA. The group asserts that their members could save the system billions of dollars per year. The annual cost of hospitalizations for diabetics alone is an estimated $65 billion.

<H2><CITE>Stride</CITE> pass-on readership</H2>
<CITE>Stride</CITE> pass-on readership has reached approximately 470,000, with distribution via some 9,000 practitioner's offices and hundreds of shoe stores and fitness and style centers. Each week, the editors of <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> and <CITE>Stride</CITE> receive two dozen or more telephoned, email, web mail, or written requests for help with biomechanical problems. All callers are referred to the "Who Can Help" section of the magazine. No individual doctor references are given out, and a variety of professional associations are always mentioned simultaneously. "It appears we are fulfilling our mission of bringing greater biomechanical health to the American public and more of the American public to the biomechanics mainstream," said <CITE>Stride</CITE> publisher Edwin Black.

<HR>

<P>Many readers have seen our Board of Advisors listed on our masthead. What they don't know is that while these individuals consult with us day in and day out, there are scores more who help us review peer manuscripts. They never get any recognition. 
<P>At any given time, between 100 and 200 manuscripts are being reviewed. Each submitted article is reviewed by at least six and sometimes up to a dozen experts from a cross-section of specialties. So many are circulating at any given time that we developed a databank to help us keep track. From that we developed a list (printed below) of those who have helped us just in the past half year. The list is organized by specialty. What the list doesn't say is that while some individuals may review just one manuscript every now and then, there are quite a few who review as many as 10 articles per month. For example, Al Pike, CP; Sean Gallagher, PT; Ken Knight, ATC; Sheldon Langer, DPM; John Michael, CPO; Glen Pfeffer, MD; Paul Scherer, DPM; and James Sammarco, MD, are typical of those who unexpectedly receive faxed manuscript after faxed manuscript. Sometimes a manuscript must be resubmitted a second time after all the marginal notes and corrections are incorporated. Because of the efforts of hundreds of practitioners, we have been able to publish scores of articles that meet a high standard of cross-specialty acceptance. I know we haven't included all of them because our database is still being tweaked. But our peer reviewers literally make <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> the magazine it is. 
<P>This is our way of saying thanks.

<H1>Tracing the Pain</H1>
<P><I>by Philip Harris, MD</I>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Back pain affects millions of Americans and starts from the ground up.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
In any given year up to 50 percent of working age adults suffer from low back pain. Yet, most practitioners rarely consider the lower extremities as a factor. Instead, they typically examine more commonly known risk factors--frequent exposure to vibration, repetitive twisting and bending, poor conditioning, and even cigarette smoking. 
<P>But etiology is often difficult to determine. Ignoring the effect of the lower extremities on back pain can mean missing the root cause of pain and denying appropriate treatment.
<P>A series of curves, including cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, and lumbar lordosis help to build a sturdy base for easy standing. This is where the lower extremities come into play. Along with these curves other body elements provide stability; namely the anterior longitudal ligament, abdominal wall, Y ligaments of the hip, posterior capsule, and the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee. Ankle stability is maintained through the gastrocsoleus muscles.
<P>When walking, the body must adjust to the force of gait, which affects both the spine and the lower extremities. Remembering that for each action there is an equal and opposite reaction, one can understand that the gravity force of the body is met by ground reaction forces transmitted up through the legs and hips.

<H2>From the Ground Up</H2>
To dissipate ground reaction forces, the body uses heel strike, pronation of the foot, and knee and hip flexion. Pelvic rotation, pelvic tilting, knee flexion, ankle motion, and horizontal movement of the center of gravity all work to minimize movement at the center of gravity and thereby decrease the amount of energy required to walk. 
<P>Any alteration in the function of the lower extremities can decrease these absorptive capacities and increase the work load and stress on various tissues. This can, in turn, lead to increased stress on the spine and its supports. The result can be a key cause of low back pain. 
<P>The most common way the foot and ankle affect back pain is through excessive pronation, either in itself or as a compensatory mechanism. This can be seen with pes planus, forefoot varus, and other conditions. 
<P>Excessive pronation can lead to a more abrupt transition in the gait cycle, which increases the transmission of force up the body. In addition, pronation leads to internal rotation of the tibia, increased internal rotation of the femur, and subsequent stress on the hip joint. Excessive pronation puts the hip in a suboptimal position, sometimes resulting in tight gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, tensor fascia lata, and piriformis. This can lead to a susceptibility to piriformis syndrome, gluteal trigger points, and sacroiliac dysfunction. 
<P>If the pelvis compensates by rotating, it can move the stress up to the spine, causing it to function in suboptimal planes and possibly exacerbating any underlying back pain. 
<P>Lower extremities can also affect back function with forefoot equinus. This creates plantarflexion of the forefoot relative to the rearfoot. The ankle must go through increased dorsiflexion to allow the body to move forward over the foot in midstance. This compensation is achieved via dorsiflexion of the metatarsal joint and/or pronation of the subtalar joint. If one cannot do this--as with a rigid forefoot valgus--one can hyperextend the knee or develop a functional leg length discrepancy, requiring increased pelvic rotation. This may lead to sacroiliac irritation or lumbosacral pain.

<H2>At the Ankle</H2>
Patients with ankle problems frequently develop a tight gastrocnemius muscle. This can impact the back by shortening stride length and tightening hamstrings. Tight hamstrings have a well-known association with back pain through various mechanisms that include pelvic rotation and flattening of the lumbar lordosis. This is especially a problem for patients with spondylolisthesis. 
<P>A tight gastrocnemius can also lead to the development of plantar fasciitis. I have had a number of patients with plantar fasciitis who experience concomitant back pain. In one case, the patient had radiculopathy with pain down the leg, documented by EMG. In treating the plantar fasciitis and prescribing a foot orthosis, we were able to resolve the leg pain and prevent what would have been an unnecessary and unsuccessful back procedure. In another case, by treating the plantar fasciitis and eliminating pain in the distal portion of the leg, we were able to greatly relieve the patient's discomfort and prevent an unnecessary and expensive work-up.


<H2>Knee Connection</H2>
The knee can also contribute to back pain. Patients with arthritic conditions of the knee can end up with flexion contractures. This frequently leads to forward flexion of the upper spine and a shift in the center of gravity. In time, patients in this situation develop tight hip flexors and kyphosis. They end up with decreased mobility of the spine, increased stress on it, and decreased ability to absorb shock. The earlier this chain of events can be interrupted, the better. 
<P>Valgus deformities at the knee can have similar effects to pes planus with internal rotation of the hip and the sequence of events as described. With severe unilateral valgus or varus, the patient can develop a leg length discrepancy. If the problem is bad enough, patients can develop uneven stride lengths, increased pelvic rotation, increased movement of the center of gravity, and increased stress on hip stabilizers and rotators. These factors can result in back pain. In addition, knee valgus or varus can cause unilateral tightness of the hamstrings, altering the lumbopelvic rhythm on one side and forcing the knee to tilt, creating asymmetric mechanics during lifting and bending activities, increasing susceptibility to back injury.

<H2>Hip Link</H2>
The hip is the final link between the lower extremities and the pelvis. A lot of the motion that was thought to originate in the back is actually pelvic rotation of the hip. This includes flexing and extending the spine as well as some rotation of the spine. When these movements are limited, stress on the back and its supporting structures is increased. The muscles that control the hip, such as the iliopsoas, glutei, piriformis, and rectus, are also connected to the spine and pelvis. When these muscles tighten, shorten, or weaken, alterations in static posture, dynamic posture, gait, and lumbosacral and pelvic rhythm can occur. This can lead to numerous pain syndromes. It is always important to evaluate the muscles acting around the hip when evaluating a patient with back pain.
<P>Lower extremity impact on the spine changes with different activities. During sports or heavy labor, alterations that may otherwise be of little clinical consequence can become significant. For example, recreational runners with excessively mobile feet may benefit from orthoses or good running shoes with a more rigid and supportive design. 
<P>Patients with rigid feet and limitations in motion may benefit from a sneaker or running shoe that has greater shock absorption capacity in the heel. When evaluating athletes, practitioners should look at their technique to understand the demands of their activities. One can then maximize their physical function as well as alter their technique, especially in situations where physical limitations prohibit ideal techniques. At times, bracing, orthoses, and taping can all prove to be beneficial and helpful. This principle may also be applied in the workplace.
<P>In sedentary occupations, low back pain may also be exacerbated by lower extremity positioning. The recent rash of cumulative trauma disorders or repetitive strain injuries has led to increased interest in the effects of static work posture. 

<H2>Seating</H2>
One key element to back trouble in the workplace is seating. While there is no perfect seat--and even if there were, it would have to be changed as the worker's job varied--there are some standard principles for healthy seating.
<P>Unsupported sitting leads to increased pelvic rotation and decreased lumbar lordosis. The result is increased stress on the discs, both through increasing trunk movement and deformation of the discs themselves. If erect posture is consciously maintained,  muscles unaccustomed to use, such as the erector spinae, must contract for long periods of time. This usually leads to fatigue and an inability to maintain that posture because of pain or discomfort. 
<P>The use of a lumbar support, preferably one that is adjustable, can maintain lordosis, decrease stress on the disc, decrease the trunk load moment, and decrease muscle activity. Moreover, appropriate back rest inclination is helpful. The height of the chair must be adjusted so that the feet can lay flat, and the knee and hip angles are not too large. If knee flexion is too great one tends to see increased hip flexion and with that, pelvic rotation and flattening of the lumbar lordosis. In addition, if the chair is too low, the weight is transferred backward on the ischial tuberosities, off the feet and thighs. The force that is usually dissipated through the legs (as much as 25 percent of the body weight) remains to tax the spine. High chairs frequently cause patients to slide forward to avoid uncomfortable pressure on the back of the thighs. When this happens, people lose the support of the back rest, necessitating increased muscular effort and eventually causing pain.
<P>Lower extremity health can contribute to the development and persistence of back pain. A thorough evaluation of alignment, mobility, and strength in the feet, legs, and hips should be included in the examination of a patient with back pain. It can make the difference between successful treatment and the development of a chronically painful back.

<P>
Chiropractic physicians have every reason to feel indignant about their access to the biomechanics mainstream. Their knowledge and experience stays within their own community and doesn't have a chance to reach and enhance practitioners from other medical specialty groups. In turn, considerable expertise from the realms of orthopedic surgery, podiatry, pedorthics, physiatry, O&#38;P, clinical athletic training, and physical therapy often remains behind its own wall. Some of the most respected vendors within the biomechanics field aren't accessible to chiropractors, especially vendors within the foot orthosis, gait analysis, and bracing industries. How many times have I heard a chiropractic physician say he submits his casts to a leading orthotic lab through a PT, MD, or DPM because the labs won't deal directly with DCs? As a result, treatment options are limited. Research and development gains are stifled.
 
<P>Frankly, in my view the losses to the vendors and even the practitioners pales in comparison to the losses suffered by the American public. If millions of chiropractic patients cannot derive the benefits of doctors who have access to the best labs, the best technology, and the best technique, then it is the patients who are most shortchanged and everyone else is a distant third in my book. 

<P>But that's over now. Welcome to a special edition of <CITE>BioMechanics Magazine</CITE>.

<P><CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> is the award-winning cross-specialty publication that eschews suffix envy to focus debate where it belongs: on procedure-specific issues. Our magazine is read by some 50,000 lower extremity providers, including most orthopedic surgeons, podiatrists, pedorthists, physiatrists, orthotists, prosthetists, clinical athletic trainers, and a fair number of physical therapists and rehabilitation specialists, but only slightly more than 1,000 chiropractors. This special edition, featuring some of the best articles ever published by <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> will go to an additional 12,000 chiropractic physicians. If you want to become a regular subscriber just fill out the cover wrap or the form on the inside back cover.

<P>Our list was painstakingly assembled to reach those practitioners we felt were most concerned with the lower extremity. The thank yous are too numerous to mention, but the Florida Chiropractic Association, California Chiropractic Association, and Thomas Hyde, DC, lead the list. 

<P>For this issue, we did not ask leading chiropractors to contribute articles. There is ample access to such materials within the chiropractic literature. Instead, we chose to assemble our previously published viewpoints proffered by the best and brightest from other specialties--precisely to fulfill <CITE>BioMechanics'</CITE> cross-specialty mission. Donald Baxter MD, Sheldon Langer DPM, Gary Gray PT, Alberto Esquenazi, MD, and Philip Harris, MD, are all towering figures within their communities. We are seeking biomechanical debate. But you can't benefit from the debate unless you're in the room. Well, the door is open.

<P>Indeed, this effort is about more choices. Do you want to explore a new technique? Do you want genuine custom orthoses produced from three- dimensional intermediary impressions produced by plaster, foam, or laser scan? Does the situation indicate a less expensive prefab, or a high-end customizable? Are you stuck with old-fashioned undefinable materials from a narrow vendor list, or do you want to sculpt your devices from identifiable materials your patient needs, produced by the best labs in the world? And if any lab won't fill your prescription, let <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> know by fax, letter, or website E-mail. We'll take a look.

<P><CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> is about change and the free exchange of ideas. Forward motion is the best motion in the world of biomechanics.

<H1>Custom Orthoses for the Workplace</H1>
<P><I>by Alberto Esquenazi, MD</I>
</CENTER>


<P>In considering foot health in the work place, the potential for injury is everywhere, and the body is constantly vulnerable. Heel cord and/or plantar fascia tightness, calf weakness, increased pronation, or high arches can increase the likelihood of foot injuries. Impaired or absent sensation creates fertile ground for disfiguring injury and complicating infections that can result in limb amputation. This is especially true for the patient with diabetic neuropathy, for whom optimal footwear and protection from temperature extremes is imperative. Indeed, for diabetics with insensate feet, foot trauma is the most common work-related problem. It can stem from a poorly-fitted work shoe that is either new and not yet broken in, one that is old and deteriorating, or one that is an incorrect size. 
<P>Trauma also can occur due to swelling of the limb after prolonged standing. External factors in the workplace that can induce trauma come in many forms and include the repetitive pounding against a hard surface that one sustains, for example, while getting on and off a truck, or going up and down steps while carrying packages.
<P>Optimizing the biomechanical posture of the foot, improving lower-limb flexibility and strength, and correcting or accommodating the presence of any abnormality in the architecture of the foot are all key interventions to prevent disabling injuries in the workplace. As witness to the necessity of such intervention, it is this practitioner's guess that more prescriptions are written for foot orthoses than for all other orthoses combined. 
<P>In the hands of the experienced practitioner (see the <A HREF="#guide">Selective Guide to Custom Orthotic Labs</A>), custom, not prefabricated, foot orthoses are an especially effective tool in the management of abnormal foot biomechanics. The wide variety of foot configuration and size indicates that, when time and economical factors permit, custom orthoses should always be considered.
<P>As the name indicates, custom orthoses are made specifically for an individual. On-site fabrication by a qualified, skilled clinician is preferable to central fabrication. Custom orthoses also are superior to prefabricated devices because they can be designed to provide optimal control of corrective forces to the affected joint. In addition, they can be configured to precisely match the anatomy and type of activity of the individual, which is of particular importance in cases of impaired sensation. 
<P>By way of example, a patient working for three years as a courier presented with right foot pain, particularly prevalent following days when she had carried some 50 packages each weighing 20 pounds. The pain was localized in the mid and forefoot. It tended to be more acute late in the day and after work, and diminished during days off and over weekends. The patient was observed in a simulated work environment during which time she was found to lead with her right foot during ascent and descent from a truck. The provision of a molded soft shoe with a reinforced sole combined with heel-cord stretching exercises resulted in rapid improvement of her condition.
<P>Custom orthoses can be corrective or accommodative. Corrective orthoses are designed to improve the position of the foot by correcting the alignment of skeletal structures; they can be made of rigid materials such as thermoplastics, acrylic laminates, and carbon graphite composites. More flexible devices are made with cork and polyethylene. Accommodative orthoses are made of soft open or closed cell foams alone or in combination with semiflexible materials, and are meant to provide cushioning and support to both normal and deformed limb structures. They prevent further deformity while ultimately improving function and controlling the direction and/or alignment of the joint movement.
<P>Appropriate posting, longitudinal or transverse arch buildups, heel lifts, pressure relief areas, or other special modifications and use of different materials in the same orthotic device can be integrated into the design and combined at the time of fabrication. Several factors should be considered when selecting materials used in custom orthotic fabrication for the workplace; these include the type of activity and work demand, the length of time to be used on the job, the amount of force to be applied across the orthosis and the amount of axial loading. Also, the amount of cushioning that is desirable without introducing stress on the ankle joint should be considered. An example of this careful application is the use of TPE (thermoplastic elastomer) for the longitudinal arch, Pelite as a molded substrate, and Poron for shock absorption in the same device. 
<P>When prescribing foot orthoses for the workplace, knowledge of the disease or disorder in question, functional anatomy, biomechanics, orthotic componentry, work requirements, and recognition of the anticipated functional outcomes are essential for proper prescription. Probative questions, for example, about different gait patterns the patient uses during the workday can also help practitioners and patients recognize and correct environmental work hazards. Information about different types of walking/work surfaces can reveal various demands placed on the locomotive system. Consideration should be given to the fact that external loads act as dynamic forces that may require different orthotic prescriptions and materials for different activities. Unlike sports orthoses, workplace orthoses often require that cosmesis supersede function and impact more heavily on user compliance.
<P>A complete orthotic prescription should consider the joints involved and the type or types of work footwear to be worn. A laced shoe, for example, is well suited to accommodate the extra space required with the addition of an orthosis. A loafer, conversely, may need to be larger (in length and/or width) or modified to accommodate the orthosis. When this is not feasible the device itself should be modified with the understanding that overall performance may be compromised. It should suggest the desired biomechanical alignment and materials of fabrication to the orthotist. In the very active adult, accommodative orthoses may need to be refurbished or replaced often to adjust for material deterioration; in the child, this should be done to accommodate growth.
<P>Casts must also be considered when one reflects upon the possible need for frequent orthotic adjustments or replacements. The expense of custom devices depends partly on the practitioner and on the fabrication time required for that particular orthosis. For a less complex accommodative device, price is not significantly different from the price of a prefabricated orthosis. Some practitioners either self-fabricate or use labs that can deliver an appliance within days instead of weeks. This time may be further reduced with the use of computerized design and manufacturing systems. 
<P>Custom orthoses also provide a wide choice of materials for manufacturing. Plastics are lightweight and cosmetically appealing; they provide total contact, adjustable flexibility, the ability to remold, and increased density. Composite and multilayered materials and metal orthoses have the advantage of increased durability and in the hands of a skilled orthotist, built-in adjustability. With the advent of new materials such as carbon graphite and extruded plastic materials, soon we should have the additional advantage of maximum tension strength with lightweight design and ease of adjustability.
<P>When the custom orthosis is ready it should be evaluated on the patient to assure proper fit and function. When these characteristics are achieved, a supervised, gradual increase in wearing time should begin. 
<P>Custom orthoses, although likely to be more expensive than prefabricated devices, in our clinical experience allow for better fit, biomechanical control, and selection of materials. In the work environment where the individual may be exposed to significant forces, these characteristics are especially important and may make the difference between an efficient worker and one who has not yet evolved to his or her fullest potential in the workplace.
<P>Clearly, the expense of casting and other factors are central obstacles for employers to overcome. But the value of preventative and/or corrective measures before a patient's situation develops or worsens must be rationally confronted with something other than a short-term fix.

<P>Selecting a custom orthotic lab isn't easy. To start, look for a lab with no secrets, that is, no secret fabrication or measuring methodologies, and of course no "secret" materials. Materials must be matched to the pathomechanics of the patient. If your lab won't answer straight questions about the exact materials used, including equivalents for proprietary names, it's time to find another lab. At least 40 prescription orthotic labs are available for chiropractic physicians. These range from small family-lead enterprises, such as Piedmont Orthotic Lab, to cutting-edge operations such as Somathotics, which is probably engaged in the most aggressive research and development to advance the field of chiropractic biomechanics. Space forbids a more detailed listing, but here is a short list of some of America's most biomechanically trustworthy custom orthotic labs.

<H1>Bad Casting: The Enemy of Custom Orthoses</H1>
<P><I>by Sheldon Langer, DPM</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Traditionally, neutral subtalar position plaster casting for the purpose of fabricating biomechanically correct functional foot orthoses has been the only acceptable method by which a practitioner could capture the unaltered angular relationships between the osseous segments of the rearfoot and the forefoot. By neutral position and unaltered, I mean that the subtalar joint is placed and retained in a position that is neither intentionally nor inadvertently pronated or supinated while the forefoot is loaded against the rearfoot.
<P>The forefoot loading process requires the placement of a dorsiflectory force against the 4th and 5th metatarsal segments (the lateral column of the foot) in such a manner that only the forefoot is fully pronated at the midtarsal joint while the subtalar joint remains fixed in its neutral position.
<P>When these maneuvers are properly performed, regardless of the technique used, the foot ends up in the most stable, and functional, position--the ideal position from which to make a model for the production of a functional orthosis.
<P>Historically, moistened plaster of Paris splints have been placed on the foot prior to the neutral position/loading process so the hardened negative cast could capture the unaltered foot positions. Today, dimensional scanning systems, such as Bergmann's Optical Casting System and Benefoot's ScanCast 3-D, may obviate the need for plaster of Paris casting. However, it is extremely unlikely that anything will ever obviate the need for good, neutral subtalar joint casting techniques.
<P>Custom-made functional foot orthoses are fabricated one at a time and each one must embody the individual variations of a particular patient's foot anatomy. Therefore accurate models on which to fabricate these orthotic devices is mandatory. To put it mildly, anything short of a totally accurate translation of the patient's foot anatomy, with its inherent rearfoot to forefoot relationships and deformities, may render the patient's therapy less effective. To put it more strongly, poor casting techniques can create iatrogenic orthotic problems.
<P>The two most widely used neutral subtalar joint/forefoot loading casting techniques are the toe suspension technique and the direct metatarsal head loading technique. When properly performed, both techniques produce negative casts that embody the inherent angular relationships of the rearfoot to the forefoot segments. These techniques also have relatively few disadvantages.
<P>The toe suspension technique is much more demanding than direct metatarsal head loading. For example, once subtalar joint neutrality has been established, the practitioner loads the forefoot by first grasping the proximal phalanges of the 4th and 5th toes, between the proximal phalanx of the thumb and second metacarpal head on the same side. Then, a lifting force must be applied while simultaneously rotating the toes in a plantar direction "over" the thumb and moving the entire foot in a dorsiflectory direction of the point of resistance--a fairly complex maneuver when properly executed.
<P>On the other hand, with the direct metatarsal head loading technique, the 4th and 5th metatarsal heads are palpated and held between the thumb and index finger of the ipsi lateral hand. Once subtalar joint neutrality has been established, a direct loading force is exerted against the 4th and 5th metatarsal heads in a dorsiflectory direction until resistance is reached, thus signifying full loading. Although a thumb print is left in the negative cast, it is easily filled in at the time of positive cast preparation, and there is little likelihood of incomplete forefoot loading. Consequently, I vote for the simpler, easier-to-perform direct metatarsal head loading technique.
<P>Correct casting procedure starts with positioning the patient comfortably in a tilt-back chair in a supine or semi-supine position or lying on a table in a prone position. Most patients, by far, prefer the semi-supine position to the prone position. Also, the prone position presents some major drawbacks. For example, if the practitioner has taken measurements particularly relating to forefoot varus or valgus, and they are not totally accurate, the practitioner has the opportunity  to realign the forefoot to match up with those incorrectly perceived measurement values. This prejudicial perception is possible because when the patient is in the prone position, the practitioner can see the bisection of the posterior aspect of the calcaneus. In the supine position, visualization of the posterior aspect of the heel is not possible. Therefore, it cannot influence the practitioner's attempt to realign the forefoot according to a measurement's preconceived notion.
<P>The prone position is also an awkward position for maintaining the foot in neutral subtalar position and for full forefoot loading since the patient's forefoot is at the lowest level. Incomplete loading of the forefoot may occur especially when the toe suspension casting technique is used, since the practitioner's hand position and rotation are reversed. Often, the 4th and 5th toes are rotated into a dorsiflexed position rather than a plantarflexed position. This, in turn, creates a plantargrade force on the 4th and 5th metatarsal heads and a resultant erroneous forefoot varus position in the negative cast.
<P>Finally, the prone position prevents the practitioner from observing when the patient is subtly "helping" by actively dorsiflexing the foot during the loading process. The intentional or inadvertent active dorsiflexion is caused by the contraction of the anterior tibial and extensor hallusis longus muscles. Their tendons become taut; this tautness is easily observed when the patient is supine, but not when he is prone. The muscle action causes elevation of the 1st metatarsal segment and possible supination of the subtalar joint, resulting in the "capture" of erroneous forefoot and rearfoot relationships. Consequently, I prefer the supine or semi-supine position.
<P>In general, casting problems are really casting errors due to lapses in technique or failure--on the part of the practitioner, casting technician, or patient--to understand and appreciate the precision the casting process requires. 
<P>In many instances, even when subtalar neutrality and forefoot loading has been correctly achieved, casts may show indentations in the area of the calcaneus, suggesting that the heel area of the cast may have been held and thus compressed or distorted. Since the soft tissue of the foot closely follows the shape of the osseous segments, an orthotic device made from such a cast could be uncomfortable or compromised in its control. There may be a basic misunderstanding of the practitioner or technician on the importance of patient positioning, preservation of cast contours, and neutral position and loading.
<P>Grasping the heel or rearfoot generally occurs when the patient has an in-toe or out-toe influence in the tibial and/or femoral segment, and the foot is either adducted or abducted during the casting process. Therefore, before starting the casting process, the patient's limb or body should be repositioned; that is, rotated or tilted so that the foot is essentially vertical from heel to toe. Then, there will be no need to "hold onto the foot" to prevent it from rolling in or out.
<P>Improper or incomplete loading of the forefoot is the most common casting error, followed closely by a failure to achieve a truly neutral subtalar joint position--one that is neither pronated nor supinated. Orthoses made on pronated plaster casts or from "pronated" electronic scanning data often are not sufficiently controlling to prevent the pathomechanics that are responsible for the patient's complaints. Conversely, supinated casts may be over-controlling and intolerable, and hence not capable of being utilized by the patient.
<P>The casting errors that cause the most damage, however, are those that either obscure true forefoot varus or valgus deformities or create erroneous forefoot varus or forefoot valgus positions in the negative plaster casts or electronic scanning data. Regardless of how they are fabricated--whether by traditional methods or CAD-CAM generation--foot orthoses made from such casts will embody erroneous forefoot to rearfoot angular relationships. Consequently, the forefoot and/or rearfoot post controls that are applied or eliminated will be erroneous, and the ability of the orthoses to properly control the biomechanical factors that cause abnormal compensatory movements will be significantly, if not totally, compromised.
<P>Clearly, casting for biomechanically controlling functional foot orthoses is a demanding process. When performed properly, it can help ensure your desired results. When done improperly, it can be your device's worst enemy.

<H1>The Relationship of Low Back Pain to the Foot</H1>
<P><I>by Gary Gray, PT</I>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Treating a foot abnormality with an appropriate interface can effectively address a cause of low back pain.</B></I></FONT>
</CENTER>

<HR>
The foot initiates a chain reaction within the locomotor system that directly influences the function of the low back. The initial function of the foot as it relates to lumbopelvic function is shock absorption. With successful pronation of the foot, the initiation of absorbing shock for the low back and the rest of the body is achieved via primary flexion of the knee and hip. Pronation of the foot, which includes eversion of the calcaneus, adduction, and plantar flexion of the talus, translates into internal rotation of the limb, as well as flexion of the limb, in order to absorb shock.
<P>With pronation, the foot can accommodate the various surfaces it meets and initiate a stable base for the limb and trunk. As the foot pronates, the midtarsal joint relatively unlocks, providing for the flexible accommodation of the foot to various ground surfaces. This temporarily flexible base allows for more proximal stability as the limb and trunk take advantage of pronation.
<P>Successful pronation of the foot allows for the appropriate chain reaction to occur at the pelvis, and therefore, at the lumbopelvic junction. As the rest of the limb is flexing, the pelvis reacts with sagittal plane anterior rotation. As the rest of the limb internally rotates during pronation, the pelvis reacts with a forward rotation of its own in the transverse plane. As the subtalar joint everts, with the knee abducting and the hip adducting, the pelvis also moves in the frontal plane into upward rotation and translation of the pelvis toward the pronating limb. The triplane motions of the foot and leg, as well as of the pelvis and lumbar spine, that are caused by ground reaction and body weight forces upon initial foot contact, are collectively termed pronation.
<P>Another significant function the foot performs on behalf of the low back during the pronation phase is the creation of loading. To be successful in locomotion and in all forms of upright function, the foot and limb must pronate to effectively load and stimulate the muscular and proprioceptive systems of the hips and pelvis, especially in the transverse plane. During pronation, the lower extremity and trunk muscles react eccentrically to gain a functional advantage toward productive movement.
<P>One of the many complexities of biomechanically integrating the function of the foot with the low back is realizing the need to also understand what the opposite foot is doing. During walking, while one foot and leg are reacting into pronation, the other foot and leg are reacting into supination. As the one leg continues to go through pronation to successfully absorb shock, accommodate to the ground, and to load the muscular and proprioceptive systems, the other limb begins its journey though the swing phase. At this time, the low back is dealing with the continued ground reaction forces of the pronating limb, the momentum forces of the swing limb, the reaction forces of the trunk, and the momentum forces of the arm swing. The low back continues to deal with significant forces as the swing limb moves forward and the stance limb undergoes transformation into supination and prepares for heel lift and propulsion.
<P>As one foot pronates and the other supinates, it is critical to understand the movement of the pelvis, and therefore, movement of the lumbopelvic junction. During pronation of one foot and leg with concurrent supination of the opposite, the pelvis anteriorly rotates in the sagittal plane, creating extension at the lumbosacral junction. 
<P>In the transverse plane, the pelvis rotates forward with the pronating limb and rearward with the supinating limb. Even though there is minimal rotation appreciated between the sacrum and the fifth lumbar vertebrae, rotation is described as forward rotation on the pronating side. 
<P>In the frontal plane, there is upward rotation of the pelvis on the pronation side and downward rotation of the pelvis on the supinated side as the pelvis translates towards the pronating limb. This frontal plane motion creates lateral flexion at the lumbosacral junction towards the pronating side and away from the supinating side. Interestingly enough, the only time during gait that there is posterior rotation of the pelvis in the sagittal plane, and therefore relative flexion at the lumbosacral junction, is during the transformation of the foot and leg from pronation into supination while the opposite leg flies by through the swing phase.
<P>As important as the foot is to the low back during pronation, it is even more important during transformation and supination. Pronation is reactively passive and supination is reactively active. Many timely events must occur for the foot and limb to successfully supinate to provide a dynamically stable base for the well-being and optimal function of the low back. Pelvic success during function allows for dynamic mechanical protection of the low back, specifically the ligaments, muscles, intervertebral disc, and zygapophyseal joints. 
<P>With pronation and supination occurring at the right time, and at the right place within all three planes throughout the entire locomotor system and into the low back, appropriate reactions and forces afford dynamic success for the lumbosacral junction and its associated structures. However, if pronatory and/or supinatory dysfunction is present in the foot and limb, there is a probability of a mechanical low back disorder that will eventually create symptoms.
<P>Foot dysfunction is one of the primary causes of abnormal pronation and supination of the limbs. Too much pronation, not enough pronation, pronation at the wrong time, early supination, and ineffective supination of the limb are some of the compensations that can dramatically affect the function of the pelvis and lumbosacral junction. 
<P>Since the primary cause of abnormal limb compensation is intrinsic to the foot, specific functional evaluative procedures must be included when assessing patients. A complete lower extremity functional profile must be developed and correlated to the upright function of the low back. 
<P>Understanding various foot dysfunctions caused by common foot abnormalities, along with our integrated biomechanical understanding of the relationship between the foot and the low back, provides a direct chain link of understanding to the possible compensations and symptoms revealed at the low back with the potential primary cause at the foot.
<P>Too much pronation too quickly as a result of a significant calcaneal varus deformity can cause a chain reaction to the lumbosacral junction of abnormal motion and forces in the sagittal plane (extension) and in the frontal plane (lateral flexion).
<P>A forefoot varus deformity, with its dramatic ill effects during propulsion, causes prolonged pronation with direct abnormal motion and forces into the low back, especially in the transverse plane. The lack of shock absorption secondary to the lack of pronation at the foot due to a hypomobile subtalar joint or a rigid forefoot valgus creates havoc up into the sacroiliac joints and lumbosacral junction. 
<P>In addition to dealing with more than their fair share of ground reaction forces, the low back structures gain no functional advantage due to the ineffective loading of the proprioceptive and muscular systems so vital to the success of the function of the low back.
<P>Simple foot and ankle equinus influences dramatically upset the timing of normal pronation and supination of the limbs and trunk, causing significant abnormal forces and motions in all three planes and ultimate mechanical low back disorders.
<P>Numerous other foot abnormalities, including midtarsal joint and first ray problems, as well as hallux dysfunctions, are direct causes for and can be linked directly to low back dysfunction.
<P>A biomechanical understanding of the relationship between the foot and the low back provides the practitioner with a functional perspective with which to evaluate the relationship between the cause of foot abnormalities and low back compensations and symptoms.
<P>The foot abnormality can be simply treated with the use of an appropriate interface, be it a lift, soft tissue supplement, prefabricated or custom-casted orthoses. The interface has the potential to create an environment that allows for more normal reaction of pronation and supination, and therefore, low back function.

<H1>The Ideal Running Orthosis
<BR>a Philosophy of Design</H1>
<P><I>by Donald E. Baxter, MD; David A. Porter, MD, PhD; Paul Flahavan, C.Ped; &#38; Charles May</I>
</CENTER>

<P>The Ideal Orthosis. Now there's a mouthful. Is there such a thing as an Ideal Foot Orthosis for runners? Can one orthosis meet all the foot needs of all people? Of course not. Is there an orthosis that is so ideal that one should wear it to prevent foot problems? Of course not. Is there one orthosis that meets all the needs of both the rigid and flexible foot? Of course not. However, is there an Ideal Orthosis for each individual with a pathologic foot disorder requiring orthotic management? We say yes.
<P>The Ideal Orthosis should be adaptable with a custom fit for comfort and a semirigid or flexible construct. It should be lightweight and inexpensive with a covering to decrease shear but give control to both the forefoot and hindfoot. The Ideal Orthosis should be durable and transferable to most shoes. It should have the ability to maintain memory in its shape and be adjustable for later modifications.
<P>Currently, there are two broad categories of orthotic design: corrective and accommodative. A rigid, corrective orthosis attempts to place the foot in a corrected position so that over time the abnormal anatomy of the foot will "mold" to the corrected position. A soft or accommodative orthosis attempts to change the stress pattern of the foot by relieving areas of high stress or by positioning the foot to allow it to absorb stress in a more physiologic manner. This kind of correction generally requires a softer orthosis. But we use accommodative orthoses almost exclusively in a semirigid construct according to the following principles.
<P><B>Adaptability.</B> Although we construct our orthoses from custom molds, the orthosis often needs to be modified to meet additional requirements. Particularly when a pronated foot undergoes corrective surgery the Ideal Orthosis should allow easy alteration from the preoperative to postoperative fit. A semirigid design easily lends itself to such modifications and adaptations.
<P><B>Custom Fit and Comfort.</B> In many instances we use off-the-shelf shoe inserts such as metatarsal pads for intractable plantar keratosis (IPK) or non-operative treatment of interdigital neuromas. However, for the Ideal Orthosis, maximal comfort and control are obtained by fabricating the orthosis from a cast of the foot in the weightbearing position using primarily impression foam as the casting medium. Bony prominence relief, metatarsal lifts, and posting can then be built into this custom fit.
<P><B>Semirigid or Flexible Construction.</B> As mentioned, we favor and prescribe semirigid orthoses almost exclusively. This allows accommodation of the running or playing surface to the pathologic foot for maximal comfort while controlling the rate of maximal velocity of pronation or giving relief to over-stressed areas of the foot. Some believe strongly in the use of rigid orthoses (typically hard plastic) constructed from a cast with the hindfoot in a neutral subtalar position. We believe the "neutral" or "corrected" subtalar position is ill-defined and not physiologically reproducible. Futhermore, the subtalar joint ranges through nearly 40 degrees of motion during running and we can't determine which of these 40 degrees is the "correct" position for each athlete. Placing the foot in the functional weightbearing position as the starting point for constructing your Ideal Orthosis seems to make physiologic sense and customizes the subtalar position for each athlete. During construction of the orthosis, attention is also paid to the position of the forefoot. Posting is added for forefoot varus or valgus. 
<P>Forefoot posting aids in hindfoot control such as in the Cavus foot with forefoot valgus and compensatory hindfoot varus. Lateral forefoot posting in this instance helps control the hindfoot varus. Small amounts of hindfoot and forefoot correction position the subtalar joint at its own neutral position at heel strike to allow as much inversion or eversion as possible in the individual athlete.
<P><B>Lightweight.</B> The need for the Ideal Orthosis to be lightweight seems obvious, but depending on the material used, the orthosis can weigh between 35 and 200 grams. Studies have found that the energy cost of running can be increased by as much as 1.7 percent to 1.9 percent with the addition of 200 grams of shoe mass. For the elite athlete we often recommend using an orthosis during training to reduce the risk of injury and stress reaction, but to compete without the orthosis because of the increased energy demand. For the noncompetitive athlete, the small increase in energy demand may be far outweighed by the comfort of the orthosis.
<P><B>Inexpensive.</B> The least expensive orthotic management involves off-the-shelf inserts which are often all that is required for the minimally pathologic foot such as mild IPKs or mild overpronation. However, for the Ideal Orthosis, customizing the insert adds expense. This expense need not, however, be excessive. Our average orthotic cost in the last year was $275. Orthoses in the $400-500 range seem exorbitant in most instances.
<P><B>Shear Control.</B> Shear control and prevention has often been a neglected area in orthotic management. We believe reducing shear is an important component of the Ideal Orthosis especially when treating sesamoiditis, hyperkeratosis, or athletes with restricted hip or ankle rotation. We accomplish this by applying a soft stretch nylon covered polyurethane foam or microshell rubber over the semirigid construct.
<P><B>Forefoot and Hindfoot Control.</B> A great deal of attention has centered on whether an orthosis can control motion of the foot. Kinematic studies have centered on the hindfoot and studies have demonstrated a small reduction in maximal pronation (10 percent or less) with a 20-70 percent reduction in maximal velocity of pronation. This reduction may be the key biomechanical alteration that orthotic management gives to result in a 60-70 percent satisfaction rate from patients.

<P><B>Transferability.</B> Athletes have numerous pairs of shoes depending on the surface and type of competition. To minimize expense and maximize continuity, the insert must be transferable from competitive shoe to training shoe to walking shoe.
<P><B>Durability and Resiliency.</B> Not only must the Ideal Orthosis be inexpensive, lightweight and able to control the forefoot and hindfoot, it also must maintain its shape after repeated use (resiliency) and stand up to repeated high compression and shear loads under elite athletic use (durability). In our experience, semirigid orthoses provide good shock absorption and foot control for 1-2 years and then may need to be replaced. Rigid orthoses may have higher durability and resiliency, but they cause discomfort for many patients who can't seem to tolerate them because of pressure under the bony prominence. Indeed, rigid orthoses can lead to increased stress reaction in the foot and lower extremity because of poor shock absorbency.
<P><B>Characteristics to Avoid.</B> Remember, avoid making an orthosis too rigid. Regardless of the position in which the orthosis places the foot ("correct" or not), if the orthosis is uncomfortable it will not be worn. Here, compliance is a dominant issue. Also, avoid trying to overcorrect the foot. For instance, overcorrecting the pronated foot can result in stress fractures of the 5th metatarsal or sinus tarsi syndrome. Also, leaving the orthosis at the forefoot level with a sharp edge can dig into metatarsal heads. If the orthosis doesn't reach the end of the shoe, place a comfortable liner over the orthosis that extends to the tips of the toes. 
<P>Another question that often arises is: Should the athlete wear an orthosis to prevent a foot or ankle problem from arising? That is, should a runner wear a prophylactic insert? We recommend these athletes wear a well constructed athletic shoe with a good arch support.
<P>Following these guidelines, we have had excellent success with orthotic management in numerous elite and recreational athletes. Patient satisfaction has ranged from 64 to an astonishing 96 percent, which is on the higher side of that quoted from patient surveys in the literature.

<HR>
The lines continue to blur between insoles and foot orthoses, and between prefabricated, customized, and custom devices. True, techniques and efficacy are blurring. But the definitions should not blur when demarcating one category from another, that is, prefabricated versus custom appliances.
<P>So there is no mistake, here's the definition: a custom foot orthosis is a device created from a corrected intermediary three-dimensional impression of the foot when that device is prescribed, modified, and fitted by a healthcare professional. The intermediary three-dimensional impression is mandatory. It does not have to be plaster. That impression can also be created by contact digitizing or optical scanning, and with less reliability by impression pillows, sand impressions, or a foam box.
<P>Individualizing, personalizing, direct molding, or otherwise customizing a prefabricated device that lacks the corrected intermediary impression dramatically improves the usefulness and appropriateness of a prefab device, but it does not magically convert that device into a custom orthosis. Again, we are not talking efficacy, only terminology. There are many excellent prefabricated devices manufactured by some of the best names in custom orthoses. Practitioners prove to themselves daily that in many instances a custom device is unwarranted and a good prefab is indicated. But, just because the correct choice was made to prescribe a prefab which took clinical savvy to customize, it is no call to pretend that a choice actually yielded a genuine custom appliance. But that is what is happening all too often thanks to two trends: professional lack of understanding and unrelenting marketeering.
<P>Let's acknowledge that technology, economics, and the march of clinical progress have surpassed the clinical terminology. Today, the words customize and custom are often separated only by a cast. But that cast is what traditionally--and tradition is the ruling concept here--distinguishes a more expensive and time intensive device.
<P>First, let's look at the cast itself. That cast is a clinical three-dimensional outline of the foot, including the plantar surface, that allows the practitioner to correct deformities. It allows for a second opinion, medical review, a benchmark for later treatment, and clinical documentation if questions ever arise. Casts are generally stored--either manually or digitally--for six months, two years, sometimes even longer. This permits a second or third device for special use or different shoes, or even if there is a tolerance problem with the original orthosis.
<P>Now, I don't have any stock in plaster or Handi Wipes. I'm not claiming that a cast is necessary in all or even most cases. But if the device is truly custom, it springs from a corrected cast. The notion that you can dip thermoldable plastic into water for 10 minutes, soften it up, and then press it onto the bottom of a patient's foot and thereby create a genuine custom device overlooks the whole notion of treating deformities. Simply echoing the shape of the deformity does not correct it. To coin a phrase: deformity in, deformity out. That's something the marketeers don't quite comprehend. This does not mean you can't create a fully functional device by diagnosing the problem, and then using your experience and talent to modify a prefab into a perfectly effective appliance. That's the value of prefabs. In many cases you can achieve the same results with far less effort or expense--or at least come close enough to bar justification of the additional expense.
<P>It's easy for prefab companies with a highly customizable direct mold product to appeal to some practitioners as though they offer a custom device. In some practice quarters, providers simply do not know the art of casting. They believe that directly molding a device to a patient's foot--without the cast--is in fact custom orthotic treatment.
<P>There would be many who would call for new terminology to keep up with the new technologies. There's merit to that. Maybe it's time to introduce a more refined category of orthosis--call it a "casted custom." Certainly, there was a call for such a change after a group of podiatrists in New York were prosecuted for attempting to obtain custom reimbursement when prescribing a prefabricated orthosis. 
<P>Interestingly enough, the newest technologies in orthotic automation--from contact digitizers to scanners to CAD-CAM millers--are all designed to fulfill traditional casted custom prescriptions. 
<P>The decision to opt for custom vs. prefab is driven by clinical, economic, and practice factors. The biomechanics mainstream has matured to the point where it can advocate the use of quality premolded devices. Functional purists such as Benefoot and PAL have successfully introduced prefabricated products. Indeed, Allied-OSI is even deploying its own prefabricated MBS as a custom by molding it to a custom cast.
<P>But until someone changes the official lexicon of biomechanics, if you go the route of a custom device, you must begin with a three-dimensional impression and work from there.

<H1>Dealing With Managed Care</H1>
<P><I>by Harry Goldsmith, DPM</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Managed care was designed as a radical new approach to deliver better health care. Something went wrong.</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>Several months ago, in a radio interview, a spokesperson for a major managed care third-party payer was quoted as saying that the industry was enjoying the financial benefits of fierce competition among physicians, medical groups, hospitals, and other providers of healthcare for patient contracts. He went on to say that the downward spiral of third-party reimbursement has not yet bottomed out in California, and that the industry would be foolish to halt what he labeled "provider driven" declining reimbursement. 
<P>Why indeed?
<P>Many of the reimbursement reductions are driven by indirect healthcare provider endorsement. Enough providers in California are worried about their potential revenue losses from being passed over or excluded from managed care contracts that they are signing any and all agreements that cross their desks. 
<P>Following basic economic dogma of noninterference with bidders willing to cut their financial throats by bidding down their reimbursement allowances, managed care plans are sitting in the catbird's seat. Their obligation to the insured is to provide primary and specialty medical care (also hospital and diagnostic availability), and their obligation to their stockholders is to operate profitably. Both goals are accomplished. Unfortunately, the healthcare provider who lost the patient contract is shut out of the market, while the "winning" provider has to deal with the arrangements negotiated. 
<P>Here's an example. Two podiatrists vied for an exclusive capitation contract to provide foot care to a managed care plan's 25,000 patients. Dr. Smith, after examining her practice, submitted a proposal to provide full-service medical and surgical foot and ankle care for 60 cents per potential patient per month. She calculated that with a guarantee of $15,000 coming in every month her incurred expenses would be met, plus a reasonable profit could be made. Dr. Jones low-balled his bid with an offer to provide the same services for 30 cents per potential patient per month. Needless to say, Dr. Jones was awarded the contract, and soon thereafter his practice saw an influx of 200 additional patient encounters per month. Unfortunately, there was only a 15 percent remaining appointment availability in his schedule to book the new managed care patients. Dr. Jones was so focused on grabbing the contract that he never really sat down and assessed the overall impact the contract would have on his practice. All he saw was a guaranteed $7,500 arriving on the first of the month. It was several months down the road that Dr. Jones calculated that on average he was receiving $37.50 a month for each patient he saw regardless of which services and procedures he performed: initial office visits, hospital consultations, matrixectomies, bunionectomies, diagnostic x-rays, and so on.
<P>It wasn't long before the flood of capitated patients began to push Dr. Jones' schedule to its limits. After two and a half months, Dr. Jones was called by the capitation plan administrator and informed that patients were complaining that they had to wait up to two weeks for an appointment. He was told that his contract guaranteed appointments within seven working days of the patient's request. Dr. Jones responded by adjusting his schedule to increase available practice hours with early morning, noon, and evening appointments. He shifted his surgical days and investigated ambulatory surgical centers with available Saturday operating times. In order to handle the increased paperwork, he upgraded his computer system to include an electronic medical record-keeping program. To help with the back office work, he hired another medical assistant. Of course, his supply costs increased, but then that was to be expected. And each month he was sent a "report card" from the plan administration that outlined a record of his patient complaints, his prescription record (with constant "encouragement" to shift his prescribing pattern from brand name medication to generic substitutes, or better yet, to over-the-counter medication), his durable medical equipment orders, the number of outside service referrals such as physical therapy or MRI, and his patients' length of stay in the hospital. Still, he was receiving a $7,500 check on the first of every month. 
<P>Dr. Jones was constantly trying to keep both the plan's patients and his "private" patients happy. In the first six months, the plan's capitated patients made up 40 percent of his monthly patient load. There were hints that the plan's marketing program was so successful that another 15,000 patients were to be added by the first of the year. It was unfortunate that some of his Medicare and better-paying PPO patients had to be given appointments several weeks down the road, but what could he do? 
<P>When I caught up with Dr. Jones about 10 months into his contract year, I asked him how things were going. He said that in 15 years of practice he had never been so busy or worked so hard. Despite this seemingly good news, he went on to say that his income was down 22 percent from the previous year. When we got around to talking about his 30-cent capitated patient allowance, I asked him how he could have afforded to submit a proposal with a reimbursement figure so significantly lower than his actual cost of doing business. He answered that he had planned right from the beginning to submit a bid low enough to guarantee him the contract. He also said that he felt that once the plan administrators saw the good quality of care he was rendering, he would be in a position to renegotiate his contract allowance to 45 cents. 
<P>I started to smile. "What's so funny?" he asked. I told him that come the anniversary date, I wouldn't be surprised if the plan administrators came to him with a song and dance about how financially tight things were and then let him know that they would have to lower his monthly per-patient capitation to 28 cents for the coming year.
<P>I was wrong. They lowered it to 25 cents. A year and a half after signing his exclusive contract, Dr. Jones was seriously considering closing his office and moving out of the area. 
<P>This example points to the ever-increasing financial dangers of signing managed care agreements without doing your homework. You should be methodically examining all the benefits and liabilities associated with the contract, and how they will affect your practice and office. 

<H2>The Benefits</H2>
The signing of managed care agreements should result in an expectation of benefits for you and your practice. These benefits should include new or recaptured sources of income, a more reliable cash flow, the perception of a busy and successful practice, as well as secondary referrals of non-managed care patients from the PPO, IPA, and HMO primary care physicians. 
<P>The value of a managed care contract increases as the reimbursement processing times decrease. Practitioners should be looking for specific contract language that clearly spells out the MCO's obligations. An ideal contract would include penalties for delays in processing provider reimbursement. Red flags should be raised if your capitation check is chronically late, if your discounted fee-for-service reimbursements frequently exceed the stated maximum processing times, if your staff has to repeatedly follow up on non-processed claims, or if your claims are routinely and unfairly denied or modified. Of course, make sure that your office follows the usual and customary billing rules, guidelines, and definitions prior to yelling at the managed care plan staff. If you take "liberties" in your billing practices, you may find yourself removed from the contract at renewal time.
<P>Theoretically, you should definitely see an increased patient load under a capitation scheme, and possibly under a PPO/IPA plan, so your office should be geared to accept these new patients in the most efficient, effective ways possible. That may mean increasing office hours or hiring additional staff. Patients should never get the impression that they are part of a cattle call. Your staff must remain courteous, kind, obedient, and cheerful despite expected additional workloads. Remember that a happy capitated patient will tell three other capitated patients to come see you, but a ticked-off managed care patient will call the plan and report you.  
<P>One of the most beneficial, and least considered, means of practice enhancement under managed care is the secondary referral. The specialist referral limitations placed on contracted primary care physicians tend to foster a secondary referral source that includes non-managed care patients for those same specialists. It is not altogether unusual for the contracted specialist to begin seeing all of the PCP's referrals: private, cash, Medicare, freebie, and even family members. Keep in mind that when some win, others lose. If a specialist happens to lose or not accept a contract, the practice will often experience a general loss of primary care physician patient referrals. It's nothing personal. It's business. The PCPs are probably not giving it a second thought. 
<P>Another benefit: Your marketing budget should go down. Since most managed care plans mail provider directories to their insureds, the money you spend on telephone directory advertisements, newspaper ads, Valu-Paks, and skywriting can be reduced significantly. These patients are directed to you through the "closed" panels of providers available. It doesn't matter how big your telephone directory ad is as long as the patient finds you in the insurance directory. Money saved is money saved. One other possible benefit in some types of managed care (usually capitation plans) is the end-of-the-year bonus program. While this is obviously not guaranteed, the bonus may be disbursed among the contracted physicians as a reward for performing efficiently and cost-effectively. This, of course, is contingent on the managed care plan's profitability. In addition, some managed care plans withhold a portion of your capitation or reimbursement allowances (10 to 20 percent) and place it in a "risk" pool account in their bank. At the end of the year, again if you meet expected goals, and the plan is profitable, all or a portion may be returned to you, generally with great fanfare. This is not a bonus. This was originally your money, which is used as a form of "carrot and stick" incentive to help ensure that you walk the straight and narrow as dictated by the plan. Think of it as a financial gun you hold to your own head. If you have such a withhold or reserve built into the plans you are considering, you should calculate your actual reimbursement based on the assumption that you will never see the withheld money again. 
  
<H2>The Liabilities</H2>
A word to the wise: If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Ask yourself, do you feel lucky today? Well, do you? How can a contract that promises you a new source of patients and money have a down side? Ask yourself: How much open time is in my practice schedule for accepting new managed care patients without displacing my current patients? How many patients your practice can absorb is probably the most important question: 10 a week? 50 a week? More? The practitioner who is looking to fill in his nearly full schedule with an occasional managed care patient can afford to be very picky in choosing the contract arrangement that best meets the practice's current and future needs.
<P>The practitioner with all kinds of time on his hands must be less picky. In the office where the daily schedule has enough holes to qualify it as a Swiss consulate, any increase in the patient load will help offset some of the office's fixed expenses. As soon as a practice stabilizes to, say, an 85 percent patient saturation level, a review should be performed on all existing managed care contracts to look for plans to delete. Those would have the lowest fee schedules; exhibit chronic delinquency in reimbursements; require more than the usual paperwork and staff time; have greater than usual pre-certification and mandatory second opinion requirements; reimburse podiatrists at a lower rate than their MD or DO counterparts when performing the same procedures on patients with the same conditions; historically refer very few or no patients to the practice; limit the scope of the treatments to a point that affects quality of care.
<P>Signing a contract with a reimbursement schedule discounted so low that you lose money each time the patient comes to your office makes no sense, but doctors do it every day. Why? There is a prevailing impression among providers that if you don't grab every contract out there, you may have lost the opportunity to participate in the managed care plan forever. This is not necessarily so. Sometimes, just say no.

<P>It began with the best of intentions. Health care was in desperate need of reform. Young, activist doctors perplexed by reactive medicine spearheaded a movement to focus on health and wellness, not sickness. Eventually, the corporations invaded the realm. By the time all the parts were sewn together and bolts of energy coursed through it, a monster arose. 
<P>Now we must cope with the Frankenstein that is managed care. By now, the term managed care has saturated this nation to the point that it is just another example of corporate doublethink like natural hair spray and diet ice cream. The system now in place is unmanaged care or mismanaged care. But managed it ain't.
<P>But I believe so many people are getting fed up with the abuses and misuses of managed care that the tide is slowly turning. You and your patients can do something to advance the change. Doctors and IPA's are helpless as they watch their patient base migrate to MCO control. Legislators are paralyzed by a whirlwind of competing special interest groups. Nonetheless, the market is primed for change. 
<P>The market is the union, governmental, and corporate buyers that contract with MCOs. Employees and members are becoming disgruntled and corporate America is tired of hearing the complaints. The emerging competitive edge among MCO's will be the qualitative edge. Quality of care can start a comeback. Of course, that would entail higher rates, more reimbursement, and more inclusion--not just more pocket lining.
<P>Any shift back to quality will gain momentum only if corporate America demands it. That means the most powerful party in this mess is the patient herself. Her complaint to her boss or union will speak more loudly and effectively than 1,000 faxes from a podiatry group to Rep. Henry Waxman. The one pathology managed care is afraid of is a corporate migraine.
<P>Relief is years away, however. Until then, podiatrists must cope day-to-day with the creature. This special podiatry issue of <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> will help. More than just a forum for commiserating, we offer practice outlooks and clinical strategies on how to succeed in a managed care environment. For example, the areas of immobilization, wound management, and custom foot orthoses have been wracked by reimbursement and management policies virtually dictating standards of care that not infrequently can compromise the patient's health. It's sad to think that many doctors can no longer offer their best care. Gag rules border on asking the doctor to undertake deception of patients by omission or silence. The professions must not permit it. And no one can gag <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE>.
<P>This issue also offers insight into one of the most successful podiatry IPAs in the country, and provides a must-read perspective by Harry Goldsmith, DPM. I love Dr. Goldsmith's work. I'm glad he's on the <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> team.
<P>There is much more that podiatry can and must do to succeed in a managed care world. Run from those within podiatry who for their own interests preach against cross-specialty cooperation. Contend intelligently and effectively with those in other specialties who construct cross-specialty barriers against cooperation with podiatry. The referral stream is too precious to divert. 
<P>Stop fragmenting podiatric presence with 50 to 60 meetings per year that dilute the buying power, clinical momentum, and lobbying voice of podiatry. Why not do as the physical therapy, orthopedic and many other disciplines do? Conduct one or two major meetings each year that enjoy massive attendance, vendor support, and political attention. I'll have more to say on that later this year.
<P>Finally, let me say a great big hello again. See you soon. How soon? Real soon.

<H1>Reengineering The Office</H1>
<P><I>by Jon A. Hultman, DPM</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Remember the "good old days" when there was a doctor shortage? A time when a drop in profit was "fixed" by simply raising fees or finding the correct billing codes? Today, instead of shortages, we have an oversupply, and competition for patients forces doctors to accept fee discounts. Initially, price competition only made it necessary for doctors to work harder for less money and trim practice "fat" where possible. Unfortunately, this provided only a short-term "fix". Ultimately, as price competition intensified and patient and paper workloads escalated, profit and quality problems became magnified. "Fixing" a practice to compete in today's environment requires radical, not incremental, changes. This being the case, what is the appropriate strategy for doctors to pursue? In a word: reengineering.
<P>My partners and I turned to reengineering seven years ago when it became clear that our office infrastructure could no longer support the demands of managed care. Our most pressing problems were high costs, an inability to keep up with the increasing volume of paperwork and phone calls, and escalating business demands that reduced the amount of time doctors and staff had for delivering patient care. Our infrastructure could barely support our existing patient volume. We first attempted to "fix" these problems with equipment. We purchased newer computers and "better" software. Instead of helping, this worsened our situation. The new computer processes required even more of our staff's time and prompted them to request additional help. It became clear that an adequate "off-the-shelf" solution did not exist. It was not until we analyzed the sources of our problems and adapted our system accordingly that we were able to do more work, better, with a smaller staff. We were even able, when necessary, to increase patient volume.
<P>When a practice is reengineered, the goals should be to organize work around results rather than tasks and to prevent problems rather than react to them. Processes are improved by making them shorter and faster and by designing them to require less supervision and produce consistent outcomes. This usually requires processes to be totally redesigned, not just "fixed." Controls incorporated into these processes eliminate expensive inspection and follow-up. Improvement comes from eliminating wasted tasks, speeding up bottlenecked tasks, and reducing variation for each task to an economic minimum. As we learned from the purchase of our new computer and software, such equipment should be employed only when it is able to accomplish one or more of these goals.
<P>Reengineering a medical practice or clinic takes a significant amount of time and can be very disruptive. Job descriptions dramatically change and boundaries between front and back offices become blurred. Decision points are moved to where the work is performed, and work is done in parallel rather than sequentially. Perhaps the biggest challenge is that the job description changes apply equally to doctors and staff. Efficiency is controlled at the point of service and the doctor is required to assume some duties not traditionally considered to be "doctor duties." It is possible to duplicate our office's successes in medical practices of any size if the doctors in these practices are amenable to learning new skills, able to tolerate a period of chaos, and are willing to learn and participate in new, nontraditional doctor roles.
<P>Doctors who are able to reengineer their practices will thrive in a mature managed care market, one that emphasizes both cost-effective care and patient satisfaction. Success in this market requires a new way of thinking, a new set of skills, and an open mind. Will you be ready?

<H1>Exclusive Provider Organizations: A Perspective</H1>
<P><I>by Paul R. Scherer, DPM</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>A California-based Executive Provider Organization gives its perspective on closed and open panels.</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>During the early part of the last decade, several sectors of the healthcare delivery industry experimented with new and innovative management methods. These methods included limiting the number of doctors from whom patients could seek care, critical evaluation of the doctors selected to participate, and strict monitoring of the doctors' practice and procedures. Initial experiments in these methods so greatly reduced the cost and improved the quality of care that a revolution was begun in the industry. Many believe the revolution has gone too far, especially those left outside the new systems.
<P>Podiatry Plan was one of those early experiments, which are now known as Single Specialty Medical Groups. When we first began in 1983, we were called an Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO). Eighty podiatrists were carefully selected in Northern California to provide care to 40,000 beneficiaries of an ERISA Trust Fund. A fee for each podiatric procedure was established. The term exclusive meant that an indemnity patient from this group would receive no benefits for care received outside the group. The program included controls such as prior authorization of all surgery--inpatient or outpatient--and the capturing of data to create provider outcome profiles. Following the first year of operation, more patients went to see a podiatrist than the previous year and at almost half the cost. The savings predominantly came from the elimination of unnecessary procedures and hospitalizations and controlling over-utilization of x-rays, orthotics, and minor surgical procedures. The administrative cost of the program was borne by the insurance company, not the provider.
<P>Additional cost savings were realized by offering a 20 percent discount fee rate from the usual and customary. Providers accepted this discount in return for increased volume, quicker payment of claims, and reduced paperwork. The providers within the group ultimately were satisfied with this discount rate because reimbursement from other health insurance companies had plummeted even further under other managed care scenarios.
<P>Podiatrists excluded from the group were frustrated because only one or two podiatrists in a particular area were chosen to participate. This "froze out" all the other podiatrists in that area. The California Podiatric Medical Association (CPMA) formed a parallel organization in 1985 to compete, but it allowed all association members who applied to participate. This organization ultimately did not succeed and was reborn in 1993, but continues to be unable to secure a broad patient base. Its lack of success is due to both provider ownership and a liberal certification process. Other recent panels in California and Arizona also have not been successful because the only entrance requirement was the application fee. The fear of exclusion has driven some providers to join these groups with slim prospects for success.
<P>The success of Podiatry Plan, since its first contract in 1983, has been good. We now provide a managed service for almost 700,000 beneficiaries in California, Nevada, and Hawaii. We have 350 providers selected by a critical review based on NCQA Guidelines. This review includes primary evaluation of credentials, malpractice records, and an assessment of competence by the provider's peers in their community. Once accepted--and to stay in the program--the providers must also pass onsite visits.
<P>Podiatry Plan is a closely held for-profit corporation. We must be efficient enough to be of value to the insurance companies; otherwise we would lose our clients. We must also cover all benefits--including orthotics and peripheral services such as routine care--and reimburse with reasonable surgical fees; otherwise we would lose our providers. This delicate balance must be struck initially and maintained for growth. Our reputation has allowed Podiatry Plan to obtain some of the highest contract and capitation rates. Its strength has provided special buying opportunities for malpractice insurance and medical supplies, and has increased access to pharmaceutical companies. The cumulative surgical load allows Podiatry Plan to demand deep discounts from surgical centers, which are then able to reduce costs to their clients.
<P>Podiatry Plan certainly is not the only single specialty medical contract group in the country for podiatry. Single specialty groups are not limited to podiatry either. Anesthesiology, urology, pathology, and even cardiac surgery have successful groups. The recent success of the Physician Resource Group (NYSE-PRG), an ophthalmology group formed as an IPO last June, demonstrates the confidence the market has in the efficiency of this form of healthcare delivery.
<P>Recent changes in healthcare are unsettling to most providers, but several basic assumptions still can be made. Change is constant. The most efficient methods will succeed, the least efficient will fail. The provider who understands what is going on will be able to predict change and will succeed.

<H1>Immobilization in a Managed Care Environment</H1>
<P><I>by Steven R. Kravitz, DPM</I>
</CENTER>

<P>In the realm of immobilization, the physician is often faced with multiple choices that can produce the same therapeutic effect, yet yield significant differences in cost. Cost is not only affected by the price of a specific supply or piece of equipment, but also by the length of the physician's or staff's treatment time. PPOs, HMOs, and similar managed care networks monitor physicians based on the quality of care, the satisfaction and outcome of the patients treated, and overall costs. The ways in which all these factors combine are creating new mandates and ground rules when immobilizing patients.
<P>Pricing of devices and methods varies significantly and practitioners must be able to choose the most cost-effective device. However, that should be based not only on competitive price, but also on the degree of comfort (which affects patient compliance) and device durability. Complicating treatment is the reality that reimbursement levels may be established by the HMO or PPO based upon the diagnosis or a specific procedure, independent of the type of immobilization utilized. These factors must all be carefully weighed in the ultimate decision making process. Here are some of the options.
<P>Pre-manufactured cam walkers and similar devices immobilize with a high degree of patient comfort and little technical time required by the physician for application of the device. Patients who must utilize ankle and/or foot immobilization for long periods of time (six weeks or longer) can benefit from the use of such devices in a cost-effective manner. For patients requiring less immobilization time, a bivalved synthetic cast can be used for non-weightbearing treatment programs, or for weightbearing immobilization with the use of a cast shoe. This less expensive alternative to the cam walker allows for easy examination of a wound and physical therapy. 
<P>For long-term use, casts often are less durable than cam walkers and may need to be replaced. This adds to the physician's time and increases the overall treatment cost. In these situations, cam walkers can be significantly beneficial. 
<P>A plaster--or if necessary synthetic--posterior splint is often a satisfactory method of applying cost-effective non-weightbearing immobilization for the short term. Pre-manufactured splints are only cost-effective when used for a longer period of time. Therefore, acute ankle sprains and similar injuries often benefit from application of an office-made posterior splint. This can be followed by plaster or synthetic (fiberglass) casts for longer-term immobilization following the acute phase of swelling or as part of the overall postoperative management of a patient following osteotomy and similar surgical procedures. These devices are cost-effective, provide protective non-weightbearing immobilization, and allow for expedient wound inspection and dressing changes. 
<P>Patient selection is important here. Posterior splints provide less protection than an applied cast to a surgical site. The active patient who may present a compliance concern for the usual postoperative instructions, such as resting and elevating the surgical foot, may require the use of a cast application providing more protection to the surgical site. Such immobilization decreases the possibility of expensive post-operative complications secondary to osseous trauma to reconstructive osteotomy procedures. Hence, judging compliance and obtaining better ultimate outcomes are organically linked to success with the MCO.
<P>Longer-term splintage can be dispensed through a variety of ankle stirrup splint devices. Padded air bladder ankle stirrup splints allow return to active ambulation and athletic activity while protecting the ankle and rearfoot from inversion, and thus reproduction of an acute ankle or subtalar injury. At the same time, these devices allow for active participation of the patient in vigorous daily activities, which aids in the rehabilitation of the injured site. The patient may ambulate with these devices for several weeks. Again, patient compliance and comfort are primary concerns. At times, in a manufacturer's attempt to gain a competitive edge in the overall marketplace by lower cost factors, a less expensive device can sacrifice comfort. Therefore, physicians should carefully examine any new device and evaluate both efficiency and comfort.
<P>Adhesive tape strapping can be used for splintage of multiple ankle and pedal sprains and strains. These dressings provide partial immobilization but can be effective in significantly decreasing the possibility of re-injury to a recently sprained ankle, acute plantar fasciitis, or similar soft tissue injuries. These dressings are, of course, very temporary. When repeated application is required for long periods of time, other forms of splintage often are preferred. 
<P>Plaster for the application of posterior splints and casts is certainly less expensive than synthetic material. When utilized for just several days, plaster certainly may be satisfactory, but it is far less durable than fiberglass and similar synthetic products. Hence, when given the time required and the supplies necessary to reapply a less durable device, fiberglass and similar synthetic casting materials become attractive alternatives.
<P>The managed care environment has focused the physician's attention on methods of immobilization that not only provide a high quality of care but are also cost-effective. Methods of immobilization that are more costly initially can be justified in the overall treatment regimen of the patient when extended periods of immobilization are necessary. Remember, cost-effective doesn't mean just less expensive: it means low cost with high effectiveness.

<H1>Healing the Wound in a Managed Care Environment</H1>
<P><I>by John C. Sorensen, DPM</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>The national cost  of chronic wounds is impossible to determine, but estimates approach six billion dollars.
</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>Managed care forces us as providers to closely evaluate our algorithms for treatment delivery. The emphasis must be on prevention. This means an even greater provider role as educator as much as healer. That said, how do we approach chronic ulcerations in a capitated environment? Of course the provider must be well-versed in cost vs. outcomes for a given patient presentation. It's an ongoing process of evaluation of support services, quality of care, and utilization management.
<P>Each year, up to three million leg ulcers occur in patients in the United States, including venous stasis ulcers, diabetic ulcers, ischemic leg ulcers, and ulcers from pressure. The national cost of chronic wounds is impossible to determine, but estimates approach six billion dollars. Clinic visits, hospitalizations, prostheses and orthoses, rehabilitation, occupational and physical therapy, and long-term care all make up a part of this staggering figure. Direct costs such as labor and materials can be calculated, but the costs due to reduction in quality of life and lost functionality cannot be measured. Yet they are two major factors in overall healthcare costs. 
<P>The process of healing from initial injury through complete epithelialization is a remarkable one. If any of the complex series of events are impeded due to the patient's underlying medical condition, presence of infection, inadequate vascular perfusion, presence of edema, or areas of increased stress, a chronic wound can develop. The reversal of these impediments, in addition to appropriate topical therapy, usually means the difference between success and failure. When evaluating a chronic wound, an appropriate work up of the patient and the wound should be done. Detailed clinical records are necessary for accurate appraisal of improvement or deterioration. Treatment plans must be dynamic; that is, the caregiver must make appropriate changes in a timely fashion. 
<P>With more patients first seeing gatekeepers in the managed healthcare arena, accurate wound assessments are vital. The patient's primary care physician should then initiate proper treatment. The physician must identify nonhealing or deteriorating wounds and refer that patient to a specialist in so-called centers of excellence while limb salvage is still an option. The timely movement of a patient from an acute to a subacute care facility to a skilled nursing home or to the patient's own home translates into lower healthcare costs and improved quality of life. But a practitioner must have knowledge of reimbursement issues, and proper documentation is important before instituting care at any of these levels.
<P>Several wound care centers of excellence have sprung from the need to incorporate a team approach in cost-effective wound healing. Curative Health Services, The Diabetic Foot Care Centers of America, and Vivra Health Advantage are examples. Others, such as the Wound Care Institute--a not-for-profit institution--promote education first. It was founded by Tamara Fishman, DPM, to enhance the current level of wound management education that caregivers possess. Centers of excellence have been shown to obtain more accurate information on the initial patient visit, utilizing a more comprehensive battery of diagnostic and laboratory tests. An economic model of the Curative Health Sciences topical releasate protocol showed reduced amputation rates and lower overall expense compared with traditional treatments in a wound care clinic.
<P>Prevention is the most cost-effective solution to ulcer management. When patients are empowered with a portion of their own care, they can assist in preventing the sequelae of disease from occurring in the first place. This should not be excused as simply "read this simple pamphlet for advice" but rather should consist of an ongoing discussion between all care givers and the patient. Educational presentations and programs allow patients and their families more direct involvement with healthcare and can help lower overall costs. The psychosocial aspects of chronic wounds should not be overlooked either. The patient's quality of life may be as important as a decrease in ulcer size. This is especially important when the risk of amputation is considered. 
<P>Lower extremity wounds can present from many different etiologies, but the most common are diabetic neurotrophic, venous stasis, ischemic, and pressure induced.
<P><B>Diabetic neuropathic ulcerations.</B> Approximately 14 million Americans are diabetics, and 15 percent of them will develop foot ulcers. One half of all leg amputations occur in diabetic patients. Morbidity and mortality from amputation continue with up to a 50 percent likelihood of contralateral limb amputation.
<P>Ulcers appear following repetitive moderate stress in a neuropathic foot. Prevention requires rigid blood glucose control to reduce the neurologic complications. Identification of the high-risk or neurologically deficient foot then necessitates adequately off-loading areas or foci of stress with prophylactic surgery and/or pressure-reducing orthoses and extra-depth or custom shoes.
<P>Patient education is very important. Diabetics must monitor their feet regularly once neuropathy is diagnosed and seek prompt medical attention whenever areas of erythema or integument breakdown have occurred. These patients unfortunately have multiple admissions for the same ulceration. A multidisciplinary team is needed to ensure that these patients do not fall between the cracks in terms of the life-long management of the disease. Algorithms such as the one introduced at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio can help the clinician in the management of the diabetic foot.
<P>The goal of such a system is improved communication between members of the limb salvage team, which in turn should lead to a reduction in the number of diabetes-related lower extremity amputations. In the new managed care era, this type of system is critical as it formulates a protocol for treatment on a large scale. This becomes very important when clinical signs of infection are present. Aggressive debridement, then meticulous wound care that includes appropriate off-weighting should continue until the ulcer has epithelialized to help prevent the sequelae of amputation or death. Clinically based research on these algorithms is necessary to show cost effectiveness of early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
<P><B>Venous Ulcerations.</B> Venous ulcers affect an estimated 500,000 Americans and are at least as common as diabetic ulcers. The average lifetime cost for chronic venous insufficiency is estimated at $40,000.
<P>Ulcers from venous hypertension usually are associated with valvular incompetence. Fibrin cuffs around capillaries cause decreased oxygen tension and lower nutritive capacity. Tissue breakdown then occurs. Lower leg edema is the usual presentation of these patients, and compression and maintenance of a clean wound environment are important. Moisture-retentive dressings can reduce dressing changes. They are more efficient, but they cannot be used with a heavily exudative wound. New layered bandage systems provide a continuous pressure gradient necessary for healing to occur. Patient education is crucial to prevent recurrence once the ulcer has healed. Recurrence is nonetheless around 70 percent and usually reflects both poor tissue quality and the patient's inability to incorporate continued compression therapy as a lifestyle modification.
<P><B>Ischemic Ulcerations.</B> Patients presenting with lower limb ischemia complain of rest pain, claudication during ambulation, and non-healing wounds. Diabetics are prone to ischemic disease at a 15-fold increase over non-diabetics. If indicated, distal bypasses are becoming more popular alternatives to amputations in the healing of ischemic ulceration. These relatively new techniques afford the vascular surgeon a means to help prevent amputation. The New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston employs an aggressive approach to revascularization. The diabetic's greatest fear is amputation, and we believe the benefits of an aggressive revascularization program outweigh the risks and costs even if this requires an initial lengthy period of hospitalization.
<P><B>Pressure Ulcerations.</B> The prevalence of pressure ulcerations ranges from 14 to 20 percent of hospitalized adult patients. This costs the U.S. healthcare system $3.5 billion annually. Treatment of pressure ulceration relies on removal of external irritants, maintenance of a moist wound environment, minimization of necrotic tissue, and restoration of proper nutrition. These wounds are a major time burden for nurses, and methods have been evaluated to make more efficient use of time resources. For example, a study published in 1993 in Decubitus comparing traditional moist gauze dressings with a hydrocolloid dressing showed a per diem savings of $8.71 for the hydrocolloid dressing, factoring in both labor and materials.
<P>The use of hemorheologic agents may be indicated in selected patients. Patient education includes the need for smoking cessation, the encouragement of an exercise program to promote collateralization, and dietary modifications.
<P>At this time, very few managed care contracts are given to centers of excellence for wound care or even foot care in these high-risk patients. Our task is to present data that first shows our cost effectiveness and second, that the relatively small number of patients with ulcerations or high-risk feet represent a disproportionate cost in terms of morbidity and mortality.
<P>Our knowledge of wound care is advancing rapidly. The healing and maintenance of patients with ulcerations undoubtedly will see many changes. It is up to us as providers to be well-versed in the appropriate identification of chronic wounds and progression through successful algorithms to improve overall health--and to heal the patient's wounds.

<H1>Custom Foot Orthoses and the Tribulations of Managed Care</H1>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>
When do financial realities become moral responsibilities?</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>The way it used to be is nearly over for many podiatrists. Managed care has fixed the problem. But now, as we see, the cure for America's healthcare woes is worse than the malady. Custom foot orthotic therapy is a good example of just how bad the system is. Indeed, abuses in this area may push some podiatrists to decide if they want to consciously go along with compromised treatment that is fraught with moral and legal implications.
<P>Many doctors in managed care relationships are told they must live within certain economic facts of life. For these providers, it's a constant challenge to practice orthotic therapy as they know it with the labs they respect. Vying to answer the call are the likes of Allied-OSI with Footlights and Benefoot with its Benefoot Express. And there are many like IO Lab and Bloch Orthotic Lab, who don't bother dressing up their devices as "managed care" as much as steeply discounted. These labs and many others reduce their costs by offering stripped-down options, less service and consolidated marketing and by spending fewer resources at conventions.
<P>The story of how the orthosis industry and independent doctors coexist is another article. Today, we speak of doctors mandated to use a given lab or group of labs, which in turn have been mandated to provide a certain level of orthosis. 
<P>What is a mandated lab? MCOs and IPAs negotiate with competing labs for big contracts, say for some or all of the prescriptions of the group's doctors. Labs commit to a price and a product. You can bet the negotiation is tense as labs crunch the numbers on volume, excess capacity, guaranteed income, and final product. Sometimes, a lab mandate is a move for the better. Practitioners gain access to well-organized labs offering a variety of devices that fit within the MCO's guidelines. 
<P>The best mandated situations allow podiatrists to select from among several labs, depending on the device in question. One lab may excel at sports devices, another at diabetic devices. Some labs, especially automated labs, are excellent for appliances using Polypro. Others offer every material under the sun. Choice is important, but in even the best of such situations a practitioner may be required to abandon a good lab relationship and start a new one. Worse, his existing relationship with a longtime lab may be redefined by the MCO, which may limit certain types of devices or cost elements.
<P>Imagine being required to use one of several labs. Now imagine being limited to just two. Worse, imagine being limited to just one. Some doctors already are coming to grips with this scenario. Maybe the limitation is inconvenient but tolerable and the patient's welfare will not be compromised. But what if the mandated lab or labs in question are unable or not allowed to produce the device your patient genuinely needs?
<P>The question is near and dear to the heart of Sheldon Langer, DPM, medical director of Benefoot and arguably one of the industry's most insightful authorities on managed care. "If the mandated lab is not the practitioner's customary supplier, the doctor must find the new lab's material that is closest to what he normally uses and modify it as best he can. If the new lab can't do it, then patient welfare is the dominant mandate. Patient outcomes will not be good anyway if a compromise exists, so there may as well be some accountability. The doctor is obligated to tell the MCO that this lab may be fine for many things but not for this condition or this particular patient's needs. Otherwise he is compromising quality of care for financial reasons."
<P>Dr. Langer's advice is a fine policy for a frustrated physician who takes the time to initiate what would certainly be a lengthy dialogue with his MCO. But what's the responsibility right then and there to the patient in question, who is expecting prompt, efficacious treatment?
<P>"If Mrs. Jones is right there," says Dr. Langer, "the podiatrist is morally obligated to say, 'Plan X does not provide for Y. If you are to be properly treated you must pay for Y out of pocket.' Then it becomes a patient option."
<P>Is this permissible? "It depends on the gag rules of the specific organization," replies Dr. Langer. "From a moral stance, to not honestly disclose a compromise of care issue to a patient who relies upon your judgment is reprehensible. From the legal perspective, silence could mean great exposure. Each practitioner must reach his own point. If you can live with a mandated lab without compromising treatment standards for financial consideration, fine. But if any doctor can't, then that doctor clearly made the wrong contract and must consider his moral and legal exposure. He must speak up. Under no circumstances can a doctor say, 'I was following orders' when a patient's health is being impacted." 
<P>Speaking up is easier said than done, especially when precious MCO contracts are on the line, and with 12 guys right behind you ready to step in. All too often, the doctor compromises his financial health--he eats the difference. Indeed, in many cases, MCO's are depending upon the doctor to eat it. But that diet can't go on for long. At some point, a practitioner will take out his calculator and "just say no."
<P>Some MCO plans practice another system that guts the provider's innards. Some plans segment orthotic care so profoundly that no one can rightly assume the responsibility, yet ultimately all will share in the blame in the event of a problem. First, the podiatrist is asked to only diagnose and prescribe the orthotic device. The prescription then goes to an orthotist or orthotech, who casts the patient and forwards it to a lab or pedorthist subcontracted to the MCO. The lab sends devices back to the CO for dispensing. He receives a fee the podiatrist normally receives. The patient ultimately returns to the podiatrist for examination of the orthosis, further care, and evaluation. The podiatrist is fully expected to be responsible for that patient's outcome yet he has no control over the casting, fitting, and furnishing of the device. "In such a scenario," says Dr. Langer, "the podiatrist is cut out financially, and more reprehensibly cut out of the actual care and management of the patient." 
<P>Again, the doctor must speak honestly. Just as the doctor does not manufacture or dispense drugs, and therefore does not control their quality assurance, if a managed care plan forces a doctor out of the usual patient care control, the patient must know the truth.
<P>As managed care situations worsen, they all converge on one central issue: quality of care. "No matter how you slice it, quality of care is being sacrificed," asserts Dr. Langer. "When it becomes bad enough, the powers that be will react with long overdue oversight. But by the time that point is reached, who knows how many patients' health will have been compromised?"
<P>Managed care is market driven. Doctors and labs both are hurting, and they are helpless to change the situation. Congress isn't listening because too many of them are busy taking contributions. In-fighting and political fighting are exactly the kind of diversion managed care organizations are counting on to keep the heat away from them. Ironically, it is the party at the center of the storm--the patient--who may be able to exert some influence, not by complaining to his doctor but by complaining to his boss. 
<P>The pendulum is starting to swing as employers and unions feel employee and member frustration at the highest levels. Contractors are demanding more quality and service from MCOs. That qualitative edge is slowly becoming the competitive edge. Moreover, MCOs are being called onto the carpet by Wall Street and the financial community. Earnings have underperformed and MCOs are now admitting they simply can't continue providing the services people need at the costs previously imagined. MCOs are warning that rates will increase. Bet on it. But such increases must yield greater care, not simply more MCO profits--or healthcare has not gained.
<P>Patients want more care. Doctors want to render more care. In the realm of orthotic control, doctors must reconcile both of these demands with the realities of managed care. In doing so, each practitioner may arrive at the point where he can no longer be silent. 
<P>And when finally you speak, speak loudly.

<H1>Unleashing the Fire Inside</H1>

<P>One chilled Autumn Sunday about 25 years ago, we were jogging around the block just down from Gladys' restaurant, on the south side of Chicago. As the leaves crackled beneath our feet, I asked, "So you still run, even at your age?" Jesse Owens, known then as "The Fastest Man on Earth," turned to me and said, "It's what's in here that counts," pointing to his heart, and adding, "It's what's inside. Anyone can turn it loose."
<P>This August in Atlanta, more than 3,000 Paralympians turned it loose in a magical integration of their own innate drive, the best prosthetic technology known to mankind, and a profession-wide effort to make each individual be all that he or she could be. World records, personal limitations, and not a few hearts were broken by the awesome spectacle of the Paralympics. It's what's inside, as Owens said. And indeed the magnificent glory of the 10th Paralympiad was that the fire inside these world class athletes burning to explode was indeed unleashed. 
<P>The unleashers were the P&#38;O community, working both as a unit and through a cadre of its best and brightest. They are the wizards, the empowerers, the magicians of human movement that help fearless and determined athletes to new levels of achievement. Perhaps the most important realization for the world is one emphasized by some of this special issue's contributors: these athletes are not engaged in a "feel good" athletic event, where everybody wins just for trying. Failing to medal is as crushing a blow to these athletes as it is to any other. 
<P>Paralympians are world-class athletes who are faster, stronger, and more energized than 99.9 percent of humanity--and just a second or two behind able-bodied Olympians. They are driven to medal, obsessive about their times. They want to win. Anything else is utter failure. They have gone bionic to prove it. Only when we comprehend the magnitude of defeat suffered by a Paralympian who did not achieve Gold, only then can we respect these valiant men and women for what they are: world-class athletes who deserve honor in victory and respect in defeat.
<P>Certainly, America has begun the process. This Paralympics received national attention as never before. President Bill Clinton was honorary chair of the Paralympics. The torch launched its journey to Atlanta from the White House and wound its way throughout this nation. And the grandeur of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies was unforgettable. 
<P>But the crowds that came out in Barcelona weren't there in Atlanta. Doug Mackey of Disabled Sports commented, "The crowd came disguised as empty seats." Award ceremonies were not infrequently conducted before cleaning crews and empty grandstands. Perhaps it is the organizers' insatiable desire to turn every moment into money, but the decision to charge for Paralympic tickets had a measurable impact on attendance. At Barcelona, attendance was free, and the stadiums were jammed. <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> understands that even now Sydney organizers are rethinking this decision. 
<P>Some thanks are in order. <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> thanks its special issue advisors, including Michael Joyce, CP, John Michael, CPO, Al Pike, CP, Ed Harrison, and Doug Mackey and many others both among the professionals and among vendors who gave us technical and professional guidance. 
<P>Now a personal word. I see the accomplishments of the Paralympics as a miracle of our day. The inspiration these men and women offer is not limited to the disabled community. More aptly, it is the world at large that can draw the greatest inspiration from the Paralympians. One look at the accomplishments of these athletes cancels every feeble excuse one can muster to justify accepting their own limitations. The triumph in Atlanta was not that of the disabled spirit, but of the human spirit indeed!

<H1>The Moment:
<BR>Heat, Flame, Fire--Ignition</H1>
<P><I>by John Michael, CPO, with Edwin Black</I>
</CENTER>


<P>Every face on the bus dripped with sweat. It was 90 degrees with a humidity index to match, and the air conditioning unit was broken. We were still wearing our coats and ties required for the reception at the Carter Presidential Center. Each time our driver tried a better route, he soon found the way blocked by police barricades designed to control traffic. Why?
<P>Opening Ceremonies were sold out, and the streets were jammed with 85,000 people all heading one place: the Olympic Stadium! Finally, after more than 90 minutes on the steamy bus, we arrived at the Stadium--less than five minutes prior to the start of the Ceremonies. 
<P>What happened next can be described with one barely sufficient word: spectacular! 
<P>The giant stadium was filled to overflowing with 85,000 cheering spectators from all corners of the globe. It was the largest audience ever gathered to witness an event featuring athletes with a physical disability. As the American flag was raised, a bald eagle suddenly flew over the stadium, circled the flag twice, and landed on the dais. 
<P>Stirring music and the choreographed movements of hundreds of volunteers on the infield continued the spectacle. Just as the music was warming to a crescendo, the U.S. Army Golden Knights began parachuting onto the field. For his final act as a full-time enlisted man, Sgt. 1st Class Dana Bowman parachuted into the stadium wearing his dual lower limb prostheses and landed in the midst of all the excitement. Fireworks. Applause. Deafening cheers!
<P>Vice President Al Gore was among the dignitaries who opened the Tenth Paralympiad. Because more than 100 countries were represented at this Paralympics, it took quite some time for each country's athletes to parade behind their native flag. Smiles, waves, and cheers were abundant as the proud competitors entered the field to the sound of their national anthem and then circled the field. Waving flags and shouts of encouragement from the grandstands heralded each new group of competitors.
<P>The emcee for the evening's entertainment was, you guessed it: Christopher Reeve, who spoke eloquently about the achievements of the Paralympic competitors. The entire assembly rocked to live music provided by Carly Simon, Hall &#38; Oates, Liza Minnelli, Aretha Franklin, and the thousands of members of the gospel choir led by Kirk Franklin.
<P>Yet all this exhilaration was only a warm-up to the most awe-inducing event of the day: the parade of the Paralympic torch and lighting of the cauldron. The flaming torch, which had been carried across the USA beginning at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., was finally handed off to a series of Paralympic competitors who carried it around the oval track using crutches, wheelchairs, and prostheses for mobility. Paralympic spokesman Al Mead carried the torch up a long expanse of stairs to the base of the giant Olympic cauldron, using his powerful thigh musculature to compensate for the limitations of a trans-femoral prosthesis. 
<P>Then, Winter Paralympian and noted mountain climber Mark Wellman anchored the torch between his paralyzed legs and proceeded to climb eighty feet of thin wire cable. Hand over hand, inch by inch, he hauled himself up to the top and touched the torch to the cauldron. The crowd went wild with cheers and tears. Magnificent flames exploded skyward to officially ignite the Games. 
<P>Now the real fire would be unleashed as men and women overcame all obstacles to make athletic history in Atlanta.
<P>
<H2>The Crowd Came Dressed as Empty Seats</H2>
<P><I>by Doug Mackey</I>
<P>Early on, Atlanta Paralympics Organizing Committee (APOC) organizers forecasted 1,500,001 spectators would witness the Games. That was one more than in Barcelona. 
<P>By day one it was apparent the attendance prediction was optimistic. The final tally was less than half of Barcelona's. Slightly more than 700,000 attended, including both the opening and closing ceremonies. 
<P>The weekdays were toughest. It was disheartening to see venues--especially at the cavernous Olympic Stadium--virtually empty, with few on hand to witness record-shattering performances. Rain delayed competitions long past midnight, so medals presentations were played out in front of the cleaning crew and a mere smattering of fans, with national anthems echoing eerily throughout the empty stadium. Contrast that to Barcelona, where more than 5,000 fans were turned away from the sold-out gold medal basketball game. In Atlanta, slightly more than 7,000 traveled to the 16,000-seat OMNI for the bronze/gold single-admission doubleheader.
<P>Was charging an admission a mistake? No, say APOC and International Paralympics Committee (IPC) organizers. "Charging admission for the Games gives them a perceived value," said IPC Chairman Dr. Robert Steadward. However, organizers of the Sydney Games are reexamining the plan to sell tickets.

<HR>
<P>The triumph of the spirit at the 1996 Paralympic Games was a genuine three-way achievement: athlete, technology, and practitioner. World records were smashed. New personal bests were everywhere. Contenders, such as runner Tony Volpentest, extended their maximum velocity, in his case coming to within one and one-half seconds of the Olympic record. A new pinnacle of performance was achieved. Why?
<P>It would be tempting to say that new technology enabled new performance breakthroughs. But most of the technology visible on the field was not new. Certainly, much was the latest and greatest, state-of-the-art. But most of it was existing and recent technology tweaked and optimized. Little new wizardry was unveiled. 
<P>There were some notable exceptions. For example, Otto Bock's 3R80, an as-yet-unreleased knee joint, made an appearance. The rotary hydraulic knee works much like a Mazda rotary engine, dispensing with piston action. The 3R80 features a weight-activated hydraulic stance stabilizer in addition to its hydraulic swing phase control. Flex-Foot deployed its Sprint-Flex II, which utilizes an open-C configuration, rather than the traditional J-effect of the Sprint-Flex I. The open-C approach offers greater compression and rebound during running and was first tested this May. Endolite equipped bronze medal runner Todd Schaffhauser with a high activity knee frame developed earlier this year. The beefed up carbon fiber frame moves the leg more rapidly into extension.
<P>USMC provided its Multiplex ProSport to sprinter John Siciliano. The ProSport is, however, a dynamic technologic step down, according to Michael Joyce, CP, Paralympic director of prosthetic services and one of ProSport's innovators. "ProSport is fundamentally a hybrid," says Joyce. "It uses the geometry of the Mark V, but the top is titanium. It's too heavy for walking. It rebounds off the knee unit--metal on metal. No hydraulics, just a simple spring." 
<P>There were other innovations and enhancements from other vendors, but by and large, the components used at the Games were the same components already available to amputees throughout the world. The real quantum leap came not from the alloys and hydraulics of prosthetic technology but rather more from the way prosthetists enhanced existing technology to create high-performance packages. Paralympians completed the triangle when they comprehended and exploited these performance packages by training longer and harder than ever before. In addition to access to state-of-the-art devices, this time the athletes enjoyed the added benefit of dedicated prosthetists, direct manufacturer support, and often independent sponsorship. All that translated to the opportunity for more and better training. Prosthetists, coaches, and competitors worked to shave nanoseconds off times. That ceaseless adjusting of training, alignment, and suspension brought the Paralympics closer than ever to the able-bodied records. That combination propelled the contenders past their personal best, past world records, and to even more prestigious medals around their necks.
<P>"The Paralympics is not a pity sports event," said one key CPO working with the Atlanta Games. "This was a world-class athletic competition with world-class athletes. People need to understand that."
<P>More prosthetic progress was made off the field than on. New gels, sockets, and interfaces coupled with new shock-absorbing components allowed Paralympians to train harder. Comfort became an issue. Flex-Foot's omnipresent Re-Flex VSP is more than 18 months old and originally was designed for the general populace to withstand the shock of climbing stairs and stepping off curbs. This technology trickled up, says Flex-Foot's Tony Russell, because it allowed Paralympians to train harder and longer and reduce damage to their residual limb. Ohio Willow Wood made available its Alpha Cushion Liner to enhance shock absorption and reduce skin breakdown, again addressing comfort and harder training. 
<P>Perhaps the most important factor was the optimizing done by manufacturers' prosthetists. From the outset, Joyce maintained, "there are probably not six prosthetists in the world accustomed to working with this level of elite athlete. That's why I invited the representatives of the companies such as Flex-Foot, Endolite, College Park, and Otto Bock to support their products," he explains. "You can't expect a new or recently introduced product to be immediately mastered by professionals at large. But the manufacturers' representatives could optimize the components by sport, and by athlete, as no one else could."
<P>In turn, the volunteer practitioners took something back to their practices: motivation to work with hundreds of future world-class contenders who are pushing the limits of human performance. The process creates a dynamic Mobius of prosthetic advancement. The technology gravitates up, gravitates down, and comes back again, accelerating and interweaving the triumph of the human spirit with the triumph of man's technology.

<BR><B>Flex-Foot's Re-Flex VSP</B> utilizes an integrated shock absorption system. A carbon fiber compression spring and telescoping tubes provide up to an inch of vertical compression. This cushions the impact to amputees' residual limbs, allowing patients to land on their prosthesis--for example when descending stairs or curbs--without discomfort. Gait lab force plate investigations have demonstrated that the Re-Flex VSP equalized loading for both the sound and prosthetic sides.

<TD ALIGN="TOP">
<P><IMG SRC="/biomech/OandP1.96/tech2.jpg" WIDTH=78 HEIGHT=208>
<BR><B>USMC's Multiplex ProSport</B> was developed to extend the endoskeletal option to a wider range of above-knee amputees up to 350 lbs. ProSport accommodates all of the standard knee control units. The titanium knee bracket is configured with a large center hole for single-bolt socket attachment as well as with the universal four-hole pattern. A knee flexion bumper system enables the user to easily change bumper durometer to alter knee flexion "bounce" while sprinting.

<P><IMG SRC="/biomech/OandP1.96/tech3.jpg" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=191> 
<BR><B>Flex-Foot's Sprint-Flex II</B> features a C shape which increases the lever arm, allowing for greater energy storage and return and therefore propulsion. Additionally, as the C shape compresses, it provides a level of shock absorption and comfort. Shock absorption avoids the buildup of tension in the athlete's body during foot strike on the prosthetic side, thereby facilitating the desired relaxed running style.

<BR><B>Endolite's Hi-Activity Knee</B> system made of carbon fiber employs a CaTech swing and stance unit, the smallest unit of its kind. The clinical advantage of this reduced length of hydraulic knee control is that it is able to provide a lighter yet functional prosthesis for the active or athletic amputee. With the running prosthesis, it enables a longer Flex-Foot section of the prosthesis to give the amputee a higher degree of energy return when running.

<IMG SRC="/biomech/OandP1.96/michael.jpg" WIDTH=127 HEIGHT=147 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>I arrived on August 12, one of 12,000 eager and slightly dazed volunteers, to begin helping out during the 1996 Paralympic competitions in any way I could. I received a shopping bag full of information and souvenirs from the Orthotic &#38; Prosthetic Athlete Fund headquarters. Most valuable, I was to find, were a cap for protection from the hot Georgia sun and a MARTA pass for free transportation everywhere.
<P>On August 15, I met at length with the director of O&#38;P operations, Mike Joyce, CP, who was in charge of the team of ABC-certified prosthetist/orthotist volunteers. Together, we reviewed all the logistics for the venues staffed by the practitioners, trying to verify that most contingencies had been anticipated. Visits to the major venues and practice runs using public transportation verified that the plans seemed both realistic and appropriate. 
<P>In addition to the main repair stations at the Paralympic Village and Chaney Stadium, volunteers with tool kits stationed themselves at more than a dozen other venues to provide on-the-spot evaluation and simple repairs. More involved problems were whisked to the container stations for immediate servicing. After most of the major repairs and adjustments had been completed, the focus shifted to spontaneous problems, such as when Paralympian Dennis Oehler cracked his prosthesis during the evening's long jump competition. U.S. Coach Jim McElhiney, CP, temporarily glued and reinforced the area with fiberglass casting tape, allowing Oehler to complete the heat successfully and qualify for the finals. The prosthesis later was stripped, reinforced, and relaminated at the Chaney Stadium container.
<P>Occasionally, it was necessary to find a source for specialized parts such as the French prosthetic foot that an athlete from the Middle East broke during practice. After we made temporary repairs, several phone calls led to U.S. importer DAW, who was willing not only to donate but also to deliver the needed replacement at no charge. Virtually every manufacturer contacted was equally generous, allowing an average of 30 repairs per day to be completed without any charge to the participants. Some manufacturers--including Flex-Foot, Endolite, and College Park--had their own teams of cell-phone equipped staff at the Paralympics to provide repair parts or technical information on a moment's notice.
<P>There were some emergencies. On the final day, about 45 minutes after the close of the repair station in preparation for the closing ceremonies reception, a cell phone call came in. An Egyptian visitor reported needing "emergency adjustments" to his AFO's. I got back in the car and drove to the Paralympic Village to reopen the container. Two off-duty volunteers escorted the athlete to the container, where we discovered that he had somehow secured new thermoplastic floor reaction AFO's but apparently left for the Paralympics before they could be fitted or finished. The three of us trimmed, fitted, and finished the orthoses. They fit and functioned well, and the athlete left with a broad smile, confident that he could now walk reasonable distances during the closing ceremonies rather than use a wheelchair.
<P>I left with an increased respect for the tremendous achievements of all the Paralympian competitors, plus pride in the role my profession had played in supporting this noteworthy event. As I boarded the aircraft to return home, I reflected on the events of the past two weeks and concluded that, although the United States clearly has access to the leading technology in prosthesis design, such hardware only offers the <I>potential</I> for winning. It is the grueling, continuous training of these dedicated athletes, combined with their native abilities, that earns the medals.

<P>Last September, I had the privilege of doing something to help Karen Lewis, a world-class competitor in the shot put, discus, long jump, javelin, and 100-meter sprint, be the best she could be: I designed and fabricated a prosthesis for her. She currently holds world records in shot put and discus, plus national records in javelin and pentathlon. Lewis is a congenital symes amputee (through the ankle). I designed two prostheses for her: a carbon graphite socket using a sprinting style Flex-Foot Symes (also a carbon graphite composite), and a Flex-Walk. These materials make the lightest, most dynamically efficient prosthesis available. 
<P>Knowing that Lewis was going to the Paralympics, I approached Robert Owens and Bill Karcher, owners of Oregon Orthopedic, about the possibility of attending the event as her personal prosthetist. Both thought this would be a great way to support Lewis. I then contacted our governing organization, the American Board for Certification in Orthotics and Prosthetics, to get the details. I was assigned two days at the Olympic stadium covering athletic track and field and three days at Georgia International Horse Park covering the equestrian events. 
<P>Although Lewis didn't medal, she was not disappointed with her performance. After having surgery in the spring and a baby just last year, she was doing well just to be there. She was grouped with upper extremity amputees, a grouping she was not comfortable with. Her national record still stands. 
<P>Her prosthesis held up fine. In fact, the only person I had to help was a female athlete from Bermuda, who needed a cable fixed on her upper extremity prosthesis. At the equestrian events, only three competitors wore their prostheses. One man apologized to me for not wearing his. He had a shoulder disarticulation and a hip disarticulation.
<P>I wish every company would send someone to the Paralympics. More disabled people should be encouraged to compete, too. I'm going to try to go again, even though Sydney is a long way away.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Winners and Losers Indeed</B></FONT>

<P>I have heard well-meaning broadcasters say that there are no losers in the Paralympics, only winners. I am sure the athletes do not agree. They come to the Games from all parts of the world to compete at the highest level they can. They show great determination, courage, and skill. It may not be obvious to those who do not work or deal directly with physically challenged individuals, but I know they are proud to represent their countries and do their best to win medals. Like any world-class athlete, they are profoundly disappointed if they do not perform up to their abilities--if they do not win gold.
<P>Even so, the structure of the Games themselves can't help but affect the essence of the competition. This was my first parathletic event. Like others, I found the classifications a little confusing. There were athletes at all levels. There are five leading disabled sports organizations (DSOs) representing amputees, wheelchair, and others. Each DSO has a classification system based on levels of disability. There are logistical requirements that must be met to schedule an event. For example, generally there must be at least six athletes from at least four countries to hold an event. Without this minimum, the event is scratched. To me, this does not seem quite fair, but having three medals to earn and potentially only one to two competitors in a heat would take some of the meaning out of the word "competition." I hope that if more people could be made aware of their potential, they might want to compete in future events. That would broaden the Games.
<P>As a proud American, I assumed the United States would dominate in most events. I was mistaken. Track and field, for example, demonstrated the prosthetic technology the world has to offer. And, surprisingly, it was not noticeably different from what I use in my everyday practice. It seemed as though every lower extremity amputee competed with a prosthesis on some form of Flex-Foot. Carbon fiber sockets, along with the use of silicone inserts and silicone suspension sleeves, also had a good presence. State-of-the-art technology has gone global. Certainly, the Barcelona Games were a major impetus for this global sharing of technology. Sure, all this technology improves the competitors' athletic ability. More importantly, it will likely improve the everyday life of many more who are not yet world-class athletes.

<P>During the 10th Paralympic Games from August 15 through August 25, a volunteer cadre of prosthetic and orthotic practitioners provided repair services to some 3,000 physically challenged athletes from all over the world. This effort grew out of an initiative begun in 1993 by the American Orthotic and Prosthetic Association, the American Academy of Orthotists and Prosthetists, and the American Board for Certification in Orthotics and Prosthetics and was established as the Orthotic and Prosthetic Athlete Assistance Fund. The Fund was contracted by the Atlanta Paralympic Organizing Committee as the official provider of orthotic and prosthetic services during the Atlanta Paralympic Games.
<P>Those of us who had been involved in previous Paralympics and international competitions as staff members of Disabled Sports USA recognized the lack of adequate repair services for our athletes when competing. There are no words to describe the emotional damage suffered by an athlete who has trained for years for this elite level of competition only to have a failure of a prosthetic or orthotic component make competition unattainable.
<P>Through the united efforts of our profession's component manufacturers and suppliers, our patient care facilities nationwide, and our ABC-certified practitioners who volunteered their time at the Atlanta Games, we were determined to set the standard in Atlanta for future competitions.
<P>At the outset it became clear that our team of practitioners would not sit on the sidelines. As the athletes arrived in Atlanta, our screening system discovered numerous problems--everything from broken and cracked prosthetic sockets to orthotic uprights and bands being held together with athletic tape.
<P>Repairs were begun from our repair facility in the international zone adjacent to the Paralympic Village as soon as the athletes could be processed. In just two days before the opening ceremonies we engineered some 60 repairs. Upgrading of the prostheses and orthoses was not allowed, so repairs and component replacements were performed to return the devices to their original structural status. Once the Games were underway, 70 volunteer practitioners made their way in and out of Atlanta working with a system that included two fixed repair container sites provided by Otto Bock and practitioners at all competition sites. Virtually all professional skills and components were donated by the worldwide O&#38;P community. By the closing ceremony, approximately 300 repairs or replacements were recorded, ranging from total realignment and relamination of broken prostheses to replacement of crutch tips. But more important than the amount of work completed was the fact that these athletes were not denied their long-held dream of competing at the 10th Paralympic Games. We made that possible.
<P>As I look back upon our united professional effort, I remember the athletes most: the world champion swimmer from Denmark who was to carry her nation's flag in the opening ceremonies coming into the repair facility that afternoon unable to wear her prosthesis because of a broken suspension shuttle lock and then watching her proudly march that evening at the head of her delegation with her prosthesis repaired; the U.S. athlete who shattered his prosthetic lamination on his last long jump attempt in the evening preliminaries but was ready for the finals the next day after a total realignment and relamination; and the many athletes who could not even speak to us or thank us in our language but showed us their sincere appreciation for our efforts by giving us a team pin or some other small token for remembrance.
<P>I left Atlanta having proudly shared in this monumental experience with my professional colleagues. "The Triumph of the Human Spirit" was a triumph for us as well.

<P>The 1996 Paralympic Games hosted the largest number of athletes in Paralympic history. The O&#38;P Athlete Assistance Fund provided prosthetic and orthotic repair stations in 13 venues, as well as the airport and the Paralympic Village. As the director of operations for O&#38;P services, I was responsible for ensuring that no athlete was unable to compete due to failure of a prosthesis or orthotic device. To accomplish this I managed a staff of more than 70 ABC-certified practitioners from around the country, as well as a small group of international prosthetists. In the end, more than 300 repairs were accomplished and all athletes completed their events successfully.
<P>I arrived in Atlanta on August 7, with five days to prepare the repair stations and set up our main base of operations in the Paralympic Village. On August 12, 200 athletes wearing prostheses or othoses were examined for potential problems. Fifty arrived needing repairs, and five of them needed immediate repair. An additional five had problems beyond repair and had to have their prostheses replaced with like components.
<P>A swimmer from Denmark arrived with a 6-inch crack in her transtibial prosthetic socket, and it was held together with two hose clamps. It was only three days to opening ceremonies and she was the flag bearer for her country.
<P>A Russian powerlifter arrived carrying his transfemoral competition prosthesis with four cracks from top to bottom in the socket. Through his interpreter, he asked if it could be repaired in time for his competition.
<P>It seemed as though the Third World countries were using conventional componentry, most in need of repair, and the more advanced countries arrived with the latest technology built into their prostheses. Most of the first week was spent doing more than 30 repairs a day. By the start of competition, the problems that arrived with the athletes were almost all handled. Then athletes began showing up with new breakages resulting perhaps from increased levels of training as they readied for competition.
<P>The British team prosthetist kept us very busy with athletes who were cracking their laminations and needing complete replacement of their sockets. Even though these were labor-intensive operations, they were handled quickly and within 24 hours the athletes were back in their prostheses, ready for their next competition.
<P>This kind of support was possible only through the skill and dedication of the volunteer prosthetists manning their repair stations. This level of  commitment has never before been available to Paralympic athletes. The speed and thoroughness with which the repairs were handled allowed all participants to concentrate on their athletic abilities without distractions from their prostheses. I am proud of the fact that any problem, large or small, was handled with such efficiency. I hope that future Paralympic events use the 1996 Games as a model for providing O&#38;P support.

<H2>Extending Max Velocity: Volpentest vs. Volpentest</H2>                

<P><I>by Tony Volpentest</I>
       
<P>My challenge was to push my body beyond what it had ever accomplished, and indeed beyond what 99.9 percent of the humans on Earth are capable of accomplishing. Coming to Atlanta, I already possessed the confidence of winning two gold medals for the 100- and 200-meter sprint and a silver in the 4x1 relay at Barcelona. I knew I was a half-second ahead of the next guy, Neil Fuller of Australia. Fuller ran 11.97 in the 100, against my 11.36. In the 200, he ran 24.72 behind my 23.28. But I was determined to set a new world record. 
<P>That meant the one man I had to beat, the only person I had to surpass, the only guy to catch was myself. It was a race of me against me--and a race against the clock. There was only one way I could win: extend my max velocity.
<P>Extending max velocity meant my training changed, my prosthetics changed, my entire outlook changed. The burst of energy you often see at the end of a close race is the unleashing of max velocity. In my case, I needed to extend my max velocity from 40 to 65 meters.
<P>My coach believes to race fast, you have to train fast. Other countries may fall short because they train at three-fourths speed. I used to do it too. A typical workout for me used to be eight 200-meter sprints at 28 seconds with three minutes of rest in between--that was functioning at 80 percent of max velocity. The philosophy is that eventually your time will drop by simple conditioning and strengthening.
<P>Problem. Your body actually gets used to that speed as a top speed. So this year, I trained faster. I ran 180-, 150-, and 120-meter exercises at 95 percent. I rested longer, as much as five minutes between races. Faster workouts are much tougher and more demanding on the body. But you are training your muscles to fire more quickly. As such, there would be more demands on my prosthetics as well. I'm a Syme's amputee. My left leg is full-length without toes. The right leg is only three inches shorter than the left, and the foot is much smaller. I run on a Flex-Foot SprintFlex. The Flex-Foot cannot bolt under the foot; it must bolt about a quarter of the way up the shaft. The spring release was key.
<P>John Sabolich, CPO, created a new prosthetic leg, which goes up to the knee on both sides. Fundamentally, the Sabolich prosthesis duplicated the legs I received from the Shriners about five years ago. But his socket fits more precisely onto my body, so extra room is eliminated. That and newer materials meant the prosthetists could take half the weight off both legs. The legs I ran on in Spain were 4.5 lbs. each. These new legs were 2.25 lbs. each. Lightening the legs enabled my coach to train me at the more intense level--like an elite Olympic athlete. And that training is what allowed me to extend my max velocity.
<P>Things were very different this year compared with Barcelona. Many Paralympians paid their own way to Spain. For Atlanta, the United States Olympic Committee paid all travel and lodging expenses. This time, we received a lot more attention from the general public and the media. It wasn't just a single report after the Olympic Games had ended, but phenomenal ongoing daily media coverage. Crowds here, however, were smaller than Barcelona's. At Barcelona, attendance was as much as 55,000. But tickets were free. In Atlanta, they charged for tickets and we attracted only 5,000 to 10,000 per day. But as I prepared for the race, I knew that the important people in my life were in that stadium--and that was all that mattered: my brother and his wife, my coach and his family, Mom and Dad, and, of course, my wife, Alison. 
<P>In getting into position for the 100, the main demand is staying focused. Some competitors won't look at the other guy. But I knew who my main competitor was. So I just warmed up, staying relaxed and focused. I had trained a lifetime for less than 12 seconds. My partners were my family, my coach, and my technology. I was ready for the gun to fire.
<P>I heard the shot, and my body exploded in speed. I never looked back or to my left or right. But when I broke the finish line, my eyes went right to the clock. 11.36. Yes! I had reversed the last two digits on my best time, from 11.63 to 11.36. A new world record and just 1.5 seconds behind the Olympic winner himself, Canadian Donovan Bailey, who ran 9.84. 
<P>It was great. I immediately ran over to my wife. She was jumping and emotional as I crossed the line. She gave me an American flag. Flag in hand, I ran over to the one person who had made it possible for me to be there: Ross Perot, one of my key sponsors. 
<P>Perot wanted to stay low-key and didn't want a lot of press, so few knew he had taken time off from the presidential campaign to attend. For a year, he has helped me realize my dream. Way back when, he asked if my prostheses were the best. He sent me to Sabolich. And now to have Perot in the stadium as I achieved that dream and broke the world record--what an awesome feeling!
<P>The legs I ran on were essentially the same legs and feet any person can be fitted with. If I can extend my max velocity at the Paralympics, any disabled person in any situation can extend their max velocity in the races they must run every day.

<H2>One Dream, One Nightmare</H2>
<P><I>by Aimee Mullins</I>
<P>I thought watching the Opening Ceremonies for the Centennial Olympic Games would prepare me for my first experience as a member of the 1996 United States Paralympic Team. I was so wrong. Nothing could have prepared me for what awaited me when I walked with my teammates into Olympic Stadium on that balmy evening in Atlanta.
<P>After two hours of politely ushering in the other 100-plus countries, a full-house crowd rose to its feet and let loose a unified roar that shook the stands and sent a chill down the spine of every proud athlete who walked behind that star spangled banner. The Olympic fanfare only heightened as we marched around the track. Trumpets fought over crowd noise to play the universally familiar Olympic theme song, "Bugler's Dream." The only feeling I can remember was one of overwhelming emotion--wanting to laugh, scream, and cry at the same time. It made me realize how, at that moment, those present had no emotional control over body, mind, or spirit. Everything was part of a soaring throng!
<P>The only other time at which I felt such unbelievable anticipation and fear, nervousness and excitement all at once, along with this feeling of surreality, was my 100-meter race on August 17. Twenty minutes before my race, I was at the warm-up track five blocks from the stadium when I saw the heat sheet, which lists competitors and their best times. My race was a combined classification race, which meant the officiating body of the Paralympics, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), deemed it acceptable to make leg amputees race against arm amputees. The heat sheet confirmed my worst nightmare: I was the only double BK (below-the-knee) amputee in the entire race, competing against two single BK's and 12 women who were each missing a hand. (IPC rules state that there must be six women from at least four countries in order to constitute a separate race. Since there were only three leg amputees, they combined us with the arm amputees.) The arm amputees boasted recorded times between 12.2 seconds and 13.9 seconds, and my best time was 15.77 seconds.
<P>When I walked onto this same track in the Olympic Stadium, this track on which I had celebrated just two days before, I knew that it would take nothing short of a miracle to achieve my goal. In the tunnel, I said to myself right before my heat walked out, "Aimee, you are the fastest female sprinter in the United States, and that's got to count for something!" So I went out there and played the only card I had left: the crowd. I became a showman, and my crowd responded with screams and whistles, cheers and chants. That in itself was worth all the work it took to get there. I was overcome with an indescribable feeling. I can't remember anything between the time the gun went off and the finish line, but I suddenly found myself fighting tears of frustration. My time was not fast enough. All I had ever wanted was to win, to stand on that medal platform and hear my country's anthem. I felt as if I had let everyone down. But as I turned toward the stands, the people were still screaming for me, waving flags, and sharing my tears. Somebody handed me a great big flag, and I stood in front of my family, friends, and the complete strangers who came out to support me, holding up my flag for the world to see. I will never again be able to look at an American flag with the same eyes.
<P>When all was said and done (I did the long jump the following Wednesday), I set two world records in my class and had the best time of my life. I don't have any medals to hang on my wall, but I have all the memories of the time when I put on a U.S. uniform and ran for my country.

<H2>Living Up to Potential</H2>

<P><I>by Shawn Brown</I>
<P>My goal going into the Paralympics was not necessarily to win a gold medal but to set a personal best. And I succeeded. I set my sixth consecutive world record and my personal best ever, even considering my competitions before I lost my leg. Now I know there is nothing I can't do on one leg that I did on two. My next goal is to throw the discus 60 meters and to break the world record with every throw. I know it is possible, and I'm going to do it.
<P>Although I did not get an opportunity to mingle a lot with athletes from around the world, I was able to help a thrower from Ukraine. We were out throwing on the practice field when I noticed he was wearing street shoes to throw and slipping everywhere. I had a spare pair and gave them to him. He didn't speak English, and was visually impaired, so I used a lot of sign language to get him to wear the shoes. With them on, he won a silver. 
<P>I think these Paralympic Games were only the beginning of something big. I am very active in the Paralympic movement and would like to see disabled sports more accepted in the United States. It was good to launch the beginning of corporate sponsorship in the U.S. I think it can only get better from here out. We have added credibility to the movement, we broke nearly 200 world records, and we have a lot more we can do with the right support.
<P>These Paralympics made it clear that we are on the way to getting that support. I was thrilled to see the level of corporate sponsors involved. I think because Coca-Cola, IBM, Bell South, and others were so supportive and felt the Paralympics were a strong marketing venue, other large corporations and the general public became aware that we are strong athletes with whom a large demographic group can identify. There are 49 million Americans with disabilities. It is good to finally see companies realize that market potential.
<P>I believe that the trend of larger sponsors getting involved in the Games will trickle down to individual athletes being endorsed by the likes of traditional personal sponsors such as Nike, Chevrolet, and Gatorade. Personal sponsorship increases the amount of time each athlete can devote to training. With athletes training full-time for their sport, we will then boost the level of competition and awareness that bridges the gap between able and disabled sports and adds more credibility to disabled people.

<BR>The Future of O&#38;P (December 1996)

<IMG SRC="/graphics/ed.jpg" WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="304">
<H2>by <A HREF="mailto:eblack@bix.com">Edwin Black</A></H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Whirlwinds of change await just over the horizon. Welcome to our second special O&#38;P edition, "O&#38;P in the 21st Century." With cascading changes in technology and managed care, it is no wonder that many in O&#38;P worry that the first decades of the next millennium may be less friendly than the last decades of this one. 
<P>To produce this special report, <CITE>BioMechanics</CITE> first surveyed a number of leaders about their concerns for the future. From the multitude of topics suggested, we narrowed our focus to just five. We then asked several of the profession's most visionary thinkers to let their minds wander into the 21st Century. We told our contributors not to confine themselves to the year 2001, but to peer deep into the next century, even a generation or two ahead. Their articles were peer reviewed for credibility and mainstream thought. The result was five informed glimpses into the profession's future: Alvin Pike, CP, writing on scope; John Sabolich, CPO, and Giovani Ortega, BSME, writing on bionics and componentry; Marla Hirsch, Esq., writing on managed care; James Alaimo, CPO, writing on patient care facilities; and I added my own prophesy of a new global role for the profession.
<P>Remember, our contributors are predicting not what they want to occur, but what they guess will occur. Each of you has the power to join or resist those visions. But to make a difference in your future, O&#38;P must radically change its visibility with government, the biomechanics mainstream, managed care, and the public at large. Each practitioner must become a public relations ambassador in his own home town. That's a new role for many in O&#38;P. It's true the O&#38;P National Office has put a great deal of effort into positive publicity. And when John Sabolich, CPO, appears on Donahue or 20/20, he brings the entire profession with him. But for all the good PR, there are small but potent pockets within O&#38;P that find it easier to climb a tree and shun a reporter than stand on the ground and cooperate. I recall one prominent O&#38;P task force member who responded to a press inquiry by immediately insulting editors and declaring he would not cooperate. Another former leader consistently refused to grant interviews to publications outside the O&#38;P field. Why? 
<P>The profession is working magic, salvaging lives and spirits with bits of metal and fiberglass spun together to provide mobility where just years ago there would have been human desolation. Far beyond simple restorative efforts, the Paralympics have proven O&#38;P's ability to catapult its patients into a new realm of personal empowerment. But with all the recent Paralympic exposure, did we see CPs and CPOs granting interviews with local TV stations and newspapers to explain the technology and the accomplishments? Did we see a post-Paralympic parade in Washington, D.C. before Congress? Those were once in a lifetime opportunities.
<P>In a world where managed care carries no sentiment for credentials, where whole professions are wondering if they will exist in 10 to 15 years, and where not enough credit is being paid to O&#38;P, why opt for isolation? In the next century, it will be easy for the isolated to disappear. 
<P>More than preserving your rightful place in the biomechanics chain of command, by extolling O&#38;P virtues to others in health care instead of avoiding contact, by cooperating with the media instead of insulting it, by working with the public instead of ignoring them, you will make perhaps the greatest contribution to society. You will help erase the archaic stigma that so many amputees self-attach when they lose a limb. No one wants to suffer through an amputation, but when it does happen there is more than hope, there is vitality.
<P>And there will be hope and vitality in the next century. But only for those who walk forward, only for those who face the light and consider the possibilities. Admittedly, the light ahead is intense; for many it will be blinding. Hopefully this issue will give you a preview.

<CENTER>
<H1>The Next Revolution in Prosthetics: the PRE?</H1>
<P><I>by Alvin C. Pike, CP</I>
</CENTER>

<P>A revolution is brewing. CAD/CAM technology, introduced into prosthetic design several years ago, will alter the future of the profession. While it has been slow to find its place in the prosthetist's arsenal of weapons, eventually it will play a major role in the direction and future of this profession. Just as Mr. Otto Bock and his company changed the fabrication method in his time with industrialized prostheses, the computer will bring about the next revolution in prostheses for both fitting and fabrication. 
<P>Don't confuse this revolution with evolution. Big changes are coming. The next century will see an entirely new class of computer-driven O&#38;P facilities, in my opinion, similar to the optician or dentist offices of today. They will be located in medical complexes and larger shopping malls. They will not be staffed by traditional orthotists and prosthetists, but by a new breed of professionals who will evolve into a new level of practitioner. Let's call them Physical Restoration Engineers (PRE's). 
<IMG SRC="/biomech/OandP2.96/scope3.jpg" WIDTH=401 HEIGHT=153 ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="diagram">
<P>Deep into the next century, these PRE's will be drawn from the biomedical and bioengineering programs found in many universities today throughout the world. They will be a meld of disciplines: orthotics, prosthetics, anaplastology, and the as yet undefined field of osseointegrated prostheses. This new profession will not be hampered by old traditions, conflicts, or paradigms. PRE's will thrive because they will quickly grasp how present and emerging computer technology can be used to completely change the 20th century system for the delivery of orthoses and prostheses. These elite professionals will be aware and online, plugged into the new technologies being developed in the world's research laboratories. They will feel compelled to constantly take advantage of new opportunities in the rapidly changing marketplace of orthotic and prosthetic services. In short, they will be the techno-wizards of body rebuilding.
<P>Years into the 21st Century, an amputee will visit a computerized PRE office with access to a large database of successful outcomes of prosthetic device prescriptions. From their home computers, amputees will have already input data about their needs. This input will include facts about their lifestyle, workstyle, and playstyle that will guide the PRE's efforts.
<P>At the PRE's fingertips will be extensive information about socket shape, components, alignment, and other factors to be cross-referenced with what has already proven successful for many other amputees. The database technology used to cross-reference this anatomical data will be similar to that used in law enforcement today to match fingerprints. And it will be shared be PRE's globally.
<P>Selecting componentry will change dramatically. Many of today's prosthetic components are so similar that it has become virtually impossible for the practitioner to know what makes each and every component unique. Ironically, so many choices often limit the practitioner. He often remains with what he is most familiar, reducing the options available to the amputee. Indeed, every time an amputee is fit today, prosthetists start over from point A with their own cast. Prosthetists depend upon years of personal experience and memory of what has worked in the past, applying that to their next fitting. In essence, this method relies upon the many shortcomings of the human mind complicated by a list of unknown factors. The decision processes of the 21st Century will remove much of today's subjectiveness, improving the potential for a successful outcome with the very first prosthesis.
<P>Decades from now, the PRE will apply an advanced generation of CAD/CAM systems using "fuzzy logic." Information about successful fittings will be returned back to individual PRE systems and global databanks. The memory of the computer will augment that of the human practitioner. Indeed, the computer will be able to apply the memory of thousands of successful fitting outcomes from hundreds of practitioners. These practitioners will continuously consult online in real time using images and other computer tools to constantly add to this body of knowledge of successful outcomes. Developing these additional tools will require the kind of nontraditional thinking that allowed John Harlan, Craig Pratt, Ernest Burgess, MD, and David Boone, CP, to envision and develop their world-famous Shapemaker software. And so it will be for the new PRE's of the next century. 
<P>One can easily envision an encounter at the physical restoration facility of the future. An amputee with a transtibial (BK) amputation presents. A pneumatic cuff placed on the remaining limb inflates to a series of pressure settings. Differential readings obtained from the pressure transducers within the cuff produce a realization of the soft tissue and bony substructure. This data is augmented with individual and global information from the PRE. A socket template is selected to produce a test socket. The skill and talent of the traditional prosthetist won't be lost, but these new tools will elevate these skills to a much higher plane.
<P> After the test socket, a definitive socket could be produced using rapid prototype manufacturing technology similar to the "squirt shape" system developed at Northwestern University, or by another method using a direct laser cutting or fusion process. The final prosthetic socket will intimately fit the residual limb. It also will feature an outer shape that will permit inserting or attaching the socket to the present prosthesis while still retaining the previous alignment.
<P>To obtain information for alignment, shape cosmesis, and length, a laser scanner or digitizing imager such as those already being developed for other major industries would be utilized. Such a device would be coupled with a measurement-based system as currently in use by Otto Bock, Vorum, BioSculpter, IPOS, and others for above-knee sockets. These new systems will be driven by computers incorporating neural net technology.
<P>For this revolution to occur, a strong external force will be required to change the paradigms of traditional thinking about O&#38;P. This force could be nontraditional industries seeking opportunities in our marketplace. By way of example, for better or worse, agribusiness revolutionized farming with capital expertise and a business imperative, applying new technologies to family farm thinking. It may be the same for O&#38;P. Or, it may be the cumulative force of continuous change in the healthcare delivery system. Surely, the labor-intensive aspect of the O&#38;P field as it exists must be dramatically reduced. The computer will be a prime mover in this inevitable process. 
<P>Be forewarned: evolution is occurring now. But revolution is on its way. The process will not be without casualties. The healthcare system in the United States is undergoing disruptive change. Change is something the orthotics and prosthetics industry historically has been slow to accept, at least voluntarily. But change will come and it will even include the demise of patient care facilities for orthoses and prostheses as we know them today.
<P>My vision is purely intuitive, based on my own personal experiences. How close are we? CAD/CAM systems used today are but first-generation systems. Even still their value is being proven in this country and abroad in less-developed nations. Practitioners and amputees are already linked by E-mail, discussing the outcomes of prosthetic fittings and components used. Mergers and consolidations are occurring everywhere in the O&#38;P field. Managed care changes are speeding along faster than the profession's ability to react. No sooner do we digest and respond to one change than another enters the scene. Society demands mobility and O&#38;P's technologic orientation fits the future mindset.
<P>Will today's professionals sense the move of the future? It will be difficult, but I believe they will. That's why my faith is reinforced in the future of O&#38;P professionals as they confront the coming decades of the next century.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Bionic Man--Sooner Than You May Think</B></FONT>
<P><I>by John Sabolich, CPO &#38; Giovani Ortega, BSME</I>
</CENTER>
<HR>

Kids have always imitated their TV action heroes. During the '70s every kid thought he was <CITE>The Six Million Dollar Man</CITE>. In front yards all across the country, youngsters would chase each other "in slow motion" on a pair of "bionic" legs. When they caught each other one would get punched again in slow motion with a "bionic" arm. A pretend reconnaissance mission would sometimes require kids to use their "bionic" eye to spot enemy targets. As we all know, only the most experienced could look into the distance in "slow motion" without looking completely silly. Although most of us probably can't remember the contents of a single episode of the series, the opening sequence of the show burned into our memories the dream of every rehabilitation researcher: "We can rebuild him, we have the technology." 
<P><CITE>The Six Million Dollar Man</CITE> didn't offer a very realistic glimpse into the future of prosthetics. But it did provide engineers and physicians with a picture of the ultimate goal: a multidisciplinary effort to seamlessly join artificial components with human body functions. Although the show did not provide a blueprint for accomplishing such a task, a recent review of research shows that bits and pieces of the necessary technology are indeed emerging. It's just a matter of time--maybe just decades--before the next century's technology makes the bionic man possible.
<P>Research labs throughout the country are investigating at their own pace the technologies that will be used as building blocks for assembling the 21st Century bionic systems. While some aspects of the overall effort are even now well developed (non-invasive prosthetics, for example), overall progress is dependent upon overcoming numerous obstacles ahead of singular developments.
In its most elemental approach, the task of joining body to machine can be delegated to two teams with new and existing knowledge regarding the human body and its functions. Team Physiology's mission is to characterize the physiological functions necessary to interface with the artificial component. The team includes--but is not limited to--biomechanists, neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, and vascular specialists. Team Physiology's knowledge is then passed along to Team Artificial so that it can develop components capable of emulating both the anatomic and physiological functions. Team Artificial requires the help of basic researchers, computer scientists, and bio-engineers and prosthetists. So how close--or how far along--are we? The three primary areas of investigation for each team are structure, actuation, and control. (See <A HREF="#fig">Figure 1</A>).
<P><B>Structure.</B> The field of prosthetics has already proven the benefits of utilizing advanced materials for artificial limb applications. Advanced super alloys such as titanium composites like carbon fiber, borrowed from other industries, are strong, lightweight, and provide excellent structural integrity for supporting a wide range of daily living activities. These same materials could also provide a platform to support actuators, electronics, and ancillary devices in anatomically consistent dimensions. Advanced socket technology has successfully used moldable and compliant materials to improve the non-invasive interface between the residual limb and prosthetic hardware, especially in terms of skin compatibility and tissue loading during weightbearing. With respect to invasive interfaces, some research has examined the possibility of connecting the prosthetic hardware directly to the bone of an amputated limb. Problems to be addressed with this approach include dealing with bonding methods and skin infection at the exit site, but even preliminary results looks promising.
<P><B>Actuation.</B> Prosthetic researchers are frequently asked: "Why don't you just attach a robot arm or leg to amputees so they can run and walk like you and me?" Unlike existing robots, people generally don't want to be tethered to an extension cord. Nor would they like to carry around a car-sized battery all day long. The power requirements of electric motors that duplicate the forces generated by human muscle are still not available in a compact, portable power source. The human muscle is an extraordinary, energy-efficient linear actuator. The energy derived from a good country meal of chicken-fried steak, mashed potatoes, and gravy is enough to last for days of walking, running, and lifting. Remember, human muscles are miraculously lightweight and flexible, compact, and streamlined. 
<P>By contrast, electro-mechanical prosthetic devices require heavy and bulky motors, pulleys, levers, gears, and a constellation of other systems. This is all too much to fit within the confines of a human body component--such as the hand, for instance. The search for materials to duplicate human muscle recently has made significant progress. An example of this is taking place at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab where linear actuators based on polymer hydrogel are under investigation. These actuators have characteristics similar to human muscle. They have similar contraction and extension response rates, and similar ratio of contractile force to cross-section areas. The actuators are comprised of bundles of hair-like strands that contract and expand with changes in the surrounding chemical solution, specifically changes in pH. Difficulty with this approach lies mostly with the method of transporting the solution that triggers the changes in the strands. A high acid or base must flood each strand to evolve the desired response. But the means of delivering one while flushing out the other needs much further development, not to mention the safety precautions required for containing the solutions within a prosthetic limb. Encapsulated fibers of polyacrylonitrile within latex sheaths are also being investigated. Once perfected, the development actuator would be connected to structural components of the prosthetic system. Whether the connection takes place inside or outside the body will depend largely on factors of design and bio-compatibility. For instance, if the artificial limb is for the lower extremity, most likely a non-invasive interface method would be used. Indeed, even current prosthetic technology embraces this approach.
<P><B>Control.</B> Equally important to developing an energy efficient actuator that looks and acts like human muscle is the key to controlling such an actuator. For this component, Team Physiology and Team Artificial must work together. Team Physiology is dependent upon Team Artificial to develop future instruments to collect such information. But even before the Team Artificial can develop algorithms to operate the body's artificial counterparts, it must wait for information gathered by Team Physiology investigators.
<P>Human motion analysis has shown that even the simplest daily activity is really a complex orchestration of coordinated signals and responses involving the central nervous system and the musculoskeletal system. Take the simple act of walking. A simple gait cycle is really a very sophisticated function, considering just the timing issues involved. One must appropriately contract and relax muscles to create a seemingly fluid, effortless, and routine operation. Not only is the act of walking a fluid motion, but it is extremely energy efficient, requiring a minimum amount of work with the given system parts.
<P>Efforts to emulate walking in paraplegic patients have helped illustrate this point. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) can stimulate muscles no longer connected to the Central Nervous System due to spinal cord injury via implanted or transcutaneous electrodes. By computing the sequence of electrical signals to the muscles, paraplegic patients have been made to walk, albeit with an assistive device such as a walker. Anyone watching such patients will note that the movements are anything but fluid; nor are they efficient. 
<P>A great deal of information regarding timing sequences has been gained through FES studies. They have also demonstrated the need for computer-based assistance to process and control multiple inputs to actuators that must work synergistically and smooth out overall biomechanics. The Cleveland FES Center, including Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland VA Medical Center, is a leader in FES investigation and recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of its first FES implant surgery. The "neuroprosthesis" has been implanted in about 50 individuals with quadriplegia to restore hand function. An upper extremity application, it similarly endeavors to restore hand function to people suffering from pain. The neuroprosthesis, which is nearing completion of clinical trials, relies upon a pre-programmed signal sequence to electrodes implanted in the appropriate muscle groups to effect upper limb movement. 
<P>The Cleveland research is primarily supported by the Department of Veteran Affairs and the National Institutes of Health. The development of a successful interface between neural and electronic communication will also require a combined team effort. Team Artificial must develop a means of recording neural signals while Team Physiology must both interpret the signals and determine which interface methods will eliminate rejection by the nerves themselves. Technical breakthroughs in electrode development are making possible acute measures of neural signals in a multi-channel environment. What this means is that one day instead of a jumble of undifferentiated neural signals, individual signals will be measurable. As this technology and the ability to interpret these signals improves, the possibility of making a direct connection to the Central Nervous System becomes more feasible.
<P>Another important aspect to control is feedback. The Central Nervous System provides two major functions: it sends signals to the muscles to control motor activity and receives feedback signals which are interpreted by the brain. Prosthetic research has done a fair job of addressing motor control, but has not adequately addressed the important issue of the sensory feedback to include proprioception, touch, and pain upon which the brain depends. Clinical trials funded by NIH grants at Sabolich Research and Development presently are investigating the effect of a sensory feedback system in a prosthesis. Information gained from the study will be combined with the results of other leading research facilities to create a growing body of knowledge emerging from universities, hospitals, and research companies.
<IMG SRC="/biomech/OandP2.96/bionic.jpg" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=151 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>Two decades ago, a TV show raised the public level of prosthetic expectation. Researchers pursuing the goal of creating the "Bionic Man" have found that each aspect of this multidisciplinary mission contains a set of unique obstacles that must be overcome. As each research team makes progress towards finding solutions, it becomes more apparent that a system for bringing together the combined technologies must be developed. Perhaps the question is not will we one day in the 21st Century create the Bionic Man, but whether we can do it for only six million dollars.

<BR>The Future of O&#38;P (December 1996)

<CENTER>
<H1>Managed Care in the Next Century</H1>
<P><I>by Marla Durben Hirsch, Esq.</I>
</CENTER>


<P>It is the year 2005. Dr. Marcus Welby IV has just evaluated a new patient and prescribed an orthosis for him. How will the patient obtain it? Will he buy it from a drugstore? From an orthotic and prosthetic patient care center? From a durable medical equipment company? Who will pay for it? How much will it cost? While no one can predict the future with absolute certainty, several trends within both managed care and orthotics and prosthetics can be identified.
<P>In my opinion, Dr. Welby will have little control over where the patients can obtain orthotic and prosthetic devices. The referral power will be held by employees of managed care organizations, which in the year 2005 will be more pervasive and powerful than ever.
<P>In 1995, the number of enrollees in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) grew 22 percent to 67.5 million. Another 79.6 million people are eligible to use a PPO network. It is predicted in <CITE>Managed Care Outlook</CITE> that HMO enrollment alone will top 100 million members by the year 2000. Why is there such a rush to join managed care? Because healthcare costs still are rising too dramatically. For years, healthcare providers, including orthotics and prosthetics practitioners, have been able to increase their fees without question or complaint. Managed care grew as a direct result of and reaction to this unchecked growth. Employers and patients want to reduce their costs, and managed care is one way to do so without reducing many health benefits.
<P>In the next century, managed care business will be the orthotic and prosthetic practitioner's core livelihood. Furthermore, practitioners will need to participate in several different managed care contracts, not just one or two, to maintain the volume of patients necessary to survive.
<P>Managed care will dictate what type of device a patient may receive and how often it can be replaced. The patient, physician, and O&#38;P practitioner will have little say in the matter unless the patient is willing to pay out of pocket. 
<P>The orthotic and prosthetic industry has been somewhat spoiled in the past. Insurance companies generally did not question the cost or kind of orthosis or prosthesis provided to the insured. Managed care organizations, however, do just that. There is nothing inherently unlawful or inappropriate about the payer of a service--here, the insurer--to question the device being provided. The real issue is that managed care will place limits on the type and cost of a device without much knowledge of orthotic and prosthetic care. Therefore, practitioners will need to educate managed care organizations and customers, and accommodate their practices to meet their demands. 
<P>Independent O&#38;P practitioners will prosper and succeed, but only by adapting to drastic changes. Either they will need to be employed by a larger O&#38;P company or a hospital, affiliate with a larger group or national network, or provide to a rather unique specialty. In the 21st Century, the solo practitioner who is unaligned with a successful network or health system will not survive.
<P>Everything above merely mirrors the trends in other healthcare disciplines. This is crucial: the O&#38;P industry needs to realize it is not very different from any of the other healthcare fields. Doctors, physical therapists, hospitals, and other providers are also integrating and modifying their practices. Like them, the orthotic and prosthetic practitioner will work harder, see more patients, sell more "off the shelf" items, and use uncertified or lesser certified personnel or assistants to fit them.
<P>The successful practitioner in the next century must be an astute businessperson and a good clinician. With eroding margins, a firm handle on costs will be needed to survive. As for payment, orthotic and prosthetic patient care centers will submit claims and receive payment electronically.
<P>Our field is uniquely situated, and actually lucky. We can watch the evolution in the other trendsetter healthcare fields and learn from their mistakes. The O&#38;P practitioner who does that will prosper. It would be a mistake for the orthotic and prosthetic industry to pretend it will be immune from these trends.
<P>The recent negative publicity about managed care's poor treatment decisions has created a backlash against the industry. This has caused State and Federal legislatures to enact laws to control managed care, such as the increased lengths of stay laws for newborn infants, and "anti-gag" rules prohibiting managed care organizations (MCOs) from forbidding physicians to discuss alternative treatment options with patients. The government will continue to intervene whenever it deems the public's well-being has been jeopardized by managed care. But governmental regulation and protection will not extend to the orthotics and prosthetics industry unless and until we speak with a louder and more unified voice. Of course the government will be less likely to enact mandatory measures if managed care begins to police itself, as did the motion picture and television industries, and the stock and commodity fields. However, O&#38;P cannot afford to ignore either managed care or government if it wants to survive. Both must be educated. 
<P>Laws protecting infants or physicians are passed because these issues receive high publicity and/or are the subject of intense and well-organized lobbying efforts. Those issues are trendy and sexy. Orthotics and prosthetics have the same potential for media coverage. We need to attract more attention to ourselves. For instance, we should trumpet the benefits of high-tech and other orthotic and prosthetic items. In all of the articles about the 1996 Paralympics, not one noted that if managed care is permitted to set O&#38;P policies on its own, these athletes will have to pay for their prosthetic devices themselves or simply not participate. And the physical fulfillment they have attained will be out of reach of most of the disabled population. The O&#38;P practitioner needs to inform the managed care organization that a cheaper device often costs more in the long run, both for the patient's health and the health plan's pocketbook. Cost effective and successful outcomes--not low cost--is the goal. Once we educate managed care and others about O&#38;P, we have the arsenal to challenge policies limiting patients to one limb for life or a $1,500 maximum lifetime benefit. And until providers, patients, and employers stop complaining to each other and bring the issue to the forefront, managed care will continue to blithely ignore the issue and save its costs on orthotics and prosthetics.
<P>Indeed, managed care organizations will continue to attempt to save costs by contracting for ancillary services with one provider. Many MCOs still do not understand the difference between orthotics and prosthetics and ordinary durable medical equipment (DME) or other ancillary services. Without that understanding, it is still too easy for the MCOs to combine orthotics and prosthetics with DME, home health or rehabilitation, especially if they can save administrative costs and time by contracting with one provider for all of these services. The home health, rehabilitation, and DME industries will continue to capitalize on this and use O&#38;P as an add-on service or loss leader by agreeing to be responsible for orthotics and prosthetics. They can do this because they are larger, more unified, and in control of more of the MCO dollar.
<P>Then will the profession respond? Orthotics and prosthetics providers will either band together to create more leverage for themselves in working with MCOs and other providers or lose ground and/or fail in the marketplace. Orthotics and prosthetics networks will continue to grow to deal with the managed care industry--but only the better organized and more cohesive networks that treat their own members fairly will actually succeed. There has been a disturbing trend within the O&#38;P industry of providers pitting themselves against one another--mudslinging, offering drastically deep discounts without economic justification, and more. Practitioners need to build bridges between each other, not burn them. If O&#38;P providers do not compete more judiciously and recognize their common causes, the entire industry will be decimated.
<P>Practitioners will have to keep up with a managed care industry that itself will undergo continuous rapid evolution. The large MCOs will become even larger and more national by merger and acquisition. Small, specialty MCOs, some owned by physician groups and hospitals, will grow as local alternatives to the larger and more faceless MCO giants. But, dissatisfied employers and employer coalitions will contract directly with providers, bypassing MCOs completely and forcing MCOs to improve their performance to compete. Therefore, quality and satisfaction may indeed return to the forefront.
<P>Eventually, the managed care industry will be at a crossroads regarding orthotics and prosthetics services and coverage. MCOs will either allow lesser qualified people, or non orthotic and prosthetic providers, to govern the orthotic and prosthetic services provided. Or, MCOs will learn to treat orthotics and prosthetics more like the hybrid ancillary service it is: a professional service with a product component. Both trends already are apparent. At present, reimbursement for orthotic and prosthetic services is inconsistent within the managed care industry, and some of it is quite low. A combination of consumer demand and governmental action may clarify this issue and/or result in more favorable or realistic reimbursement. How the managed care industry will turn largely depends upon how the O&#38;P industry comports itself to the MCOs, government, and public.
<P>Remember, the practitioner cannot rely on Medicare or Medicaid patients to survive. Most eligible Medicare and Medicaid recipients will be channeled into Medicare and Medicaid HMOs. Why? If patients choose a health plan wisely, they can obtain more services for a cheaper insurance premium. This is especially attractive to Medicare and Medicaid eligibles, who often have little or fixed income. These product lines are already heavily regulated and scrutinized by the government, affording patients with protections not available to members in commercial MCOs. Moreover, this approach enables the government to delegate the operational and administrative burdens of healthcare to a contractor. Clearly, these can be very lucrative product lines for an HMO.
<P>As a result of privatization, more MCOs will be required to cover orthotics and prosthetics to the extent covered by Medicare and Medicaid, but at lower rates and by limiting the availability of the high-tech componentry not already covered by Medicare and Medicaid. Managed care is answering a real and perceived need to control unbridled growth, fraud, and provider excess. Is it the only answer to these problems? No. However, managed care has demonstrated success in providing care to large populations and controlling the overall cost of that care. Absent a cataclysmic event, it is very unlikely that managed care will die out or be supplanted by a different healthcare system in the next century.
<P>One prediction seems sure: the more one knows and understands the dynamics of future health care and managed care, the better prepared and able one will be to respond to the changes that will occur in the year 2000 and beyond.

<H1>Patient Care Facilities in the Next Century</H1>
<P><I>by Jim Alaimo, CPO </I>
</CENTER>

<P>How will practitioners deliver O&#38;P care in the next century? Closer examination of emerging technologies and healthcare trends yields significant insight about what is ahead. We should prepare for change in all areas, but most notably in patient care facilities, practices, documentation requirements, and practitioner responsibilities.
<P>The patient care facility itself will be quite different. Gone will be the fabrication component so prevalent in all of today's facilities. No longer will practitioners bend metal for long leg orthoses or laminate sockets for prostheses. The characteristic aroma wafting through our labs will vanish. It will be replaced by a clean, sterile, electronic laboratory. Individual facility fabrication will become cost prohibitive with OSHA, state, and local requirements leading the environmental charge to relocate fabrication centers to major hubs across the nation.
<P>The practice of casting patients will disappear, replaced by scanning devices waved over the skin. Images captured on a monitor will show multiple densities of bone and body tissue. Practitioners will perform modifications on a 3-D computer-generated model. Its sophisticated software programs will determine proper weightbearing areas, reliefs necessary for bony prominences, and length and girth measurements. These software programs will take into account patient weight, height, activity level, range of motion deficiencies, and joint alignment. Data collection will be accomplished through several methods. Functional assessment will be analyzed through sensors placed on all joint axes. Center of gravity, range of motion, and rotary motion will be gauged and fed into the computer for analysis. Subjective and objective assessments will be recorded by a hand-held computer programmed to ask a series of questions geared to the type of patient you are treating. Transfemoral patient questions, for example, will be quite different from those of upper limb patients. You will talk to your hand-held computer using a voice recognition system. The need to reduce documentation will eliminate handwritten entries. Compilation of all data will build a patient profile allowing the patient to achieve near normal ambulation and functional level. 
<P>Even the alignment process of the orthosis and prosthesis will be quite different. Microprocessing actuators will replace the orthotic and prosthetic joints commonly used today. Biomechanical alignment and cadence responsiveness will be achieved through the patient profile set up through your initial evaluation, scanning, and sensory input. Telemetry will be used on all facets of scanning alignment and patient data collections. The cumbersome hard wire technology we use today will be long gone. 
<P>Practitioner and technical staff duties will change dramatically in the next century. O&#38;P will become a global endeavor. The art and science of the orthotics and prosthetics profession will focus more on science: knowledge of telemetry, robotics, sensory equipment, and technical troubleshooting will become essential. Support staff will know how to repair microprocessors, actuators, and battery charging equipment.
<P>Highly trained practitioners will be more mobile, servicing larger geographical areas. Their traveling medical bags will contain portable scanning equipment, allowing them to see patients in any setting. Satellite facilities will be numerous and O&#38;P mega-facilities will be a thing of the past. Lesser trained yet very competent technical staff will care for patients requiring adjustments in designated hub facilities.
<P>A look ahead at the O&#38;P industry itself will show a shifting landscape. A few large companies will dominate the scenery. Yet smaller, privately-owned facilities will continue to play an important role in delivering patient care well into the 21st Century. For the most part, however, privately-owned facilities will be located farther from the big metropolitan areas that are dominated by the larger companies. Even still, most of them will maintain alliances or networks with these larger companies.
<P>Health care itself will acquire a new face. Payers will look for integrated delivery systems, seeking out providers who can cover a spectrum of patient needs and service a larger geographical area. Physical and occupational therapy combined with orthotic and prosthetic care will be considered optimal treatment of the amputee or orthotic patient. Payers will see this delivery of integrated care as a way to reduce overall healthcare costs.
<P>Cost reduction will continue to be a hot topic well into the 21st century. Providers of orthotic and prosthetic care will find fewer options available to their patients. Government will increasingly force its responsibility for care upon individual states. Services for geriatric orthotic care will grow and prosthetic care will decline. Pediatric services will always be covered since America will not allow this high-profile patient to be forgotten. The type of care patients receive will depend upon their perceived functional capability: young amputees will receive high-tech components allowing them greater freedom from their disability. On the other hand, costs associated with covering staggering numbers of elderly patients will require less sophisticated, more standardized prosthetic and orthotic devices. 
<P>Outcomes research will determine the specific devices to be used on a particular type of patient. These outcomes results will be programmed into the software that determines specific patient profiles. Much of the profiling and treatment software will be proprietary and express a pre-programmed managed care agenda or perspective. Profiles will serve as the basis for all treatment modalities.
<P>Today orthotic and prosthetic health care is transforming rapidly. Looking at the changes ahead should not be reason for uneasiness or fear. We all learn from the past; it shows us the steps necessary to keep up with advancements in the future. Some believe where there's change, there's opportunity. Those are the ones who seize future trends and their opportunities--and prosper and survive.

<H1>The Global Outlook</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Good News is All Bad</B></FONT>
<P><I>by Edwin Black</I>
</CENTER>

<HR>
Death and destruction will continue well into the next century. Mankind everywhere will learn to maim more effectively. As the third world competes without safety standards, industrial accidents will become a global epidemic. "Civilized" society's life expectancy will make centenarian status common, often regardless of the ability to maintain mobility. The world's conscience--when it is not engaged in killing--will extend its medical concern to virtually every deformity known to man. At the same time, an explosion of postponed pathology arising out of the mismanaged care of the late 1990s will yield crippled and critical multitudes.
<P>I have bad news. The outlook for O&#38;P in the next century is quite good. There will be no shortage of amputations or orthotic interventions. But there will be change. O&#38;P will become a global undertaking, both in terms of patient base, practitioner competition, delivery, and manufacturing. Those who are not mesmerized by the past, who are willing to confront the future and willing to play by different rules in the pursuit of helping humanity, will live long and prosper in the 21st Century.

<H2>War</H2>
Lower extremity prosthetics occupies a unique niche in the spectrum of healthcare delivery. There is no routine care, no preventative care--only catastrophic response to the loss or malformation of a limb. Throughout its history, the prosthetic field has found its expansion intimately tied to war. The Civil War and the Great War were milestones in O&#38;P history. Indeed, at times, the O&#38;P industry has actually been attached to the War Department. Even now, the so-called Peace Dividend is reassigning token Defense Department funds to prosthetic research at such defense installations as the Lawrence Livermore National Lab.  
<P>Since war is still a compelling factor in O&#38;P's future, let's look at war in the next century. It's a mixed prediction. For Americans, fatalities are destined to decrease. U.S. ground involvement will drop dramatically as America pursues heightened foreign intervention as a standoff force. Sea and air projection of power will manifest in remote-controlled floating arsenals with smart cruise technology. When foot soldiers are committed, it will only be as part of an "overwhelming force" designed for limited policing, peacekeeping, or peace enforcing actions. All considered, American military involvements in the next century will probably yield fewer wartime amputations--for Americans.
<P>But the enemy's biomechanical future is dire. Despite a focus on non-lethality--that is, disabling weapons that subdue but do not kill or maim--America's so-called smart destruction will yield many foreign casualties. Innocent war victims and S.O.L. combatants alike will always be too close to harm's way when America's military might comes to bear. <P>While America is refining its warmaking abilities, developing countries will continue to play catch up. Genocide and invasion will become too easy. Too many will beat their plowshares into swords and their pruning hooks into spears, and then trade them in for AK-47s and mobile killing vans. Smoldering rivalries and conflicts will constantly ignite and reignite in short, horrific wars yielding hideous human decimation.
<P>The war crippled of the planet will become a multitude. We will see them on our TV screens and in our magazines. Our hearts will open. The world will want to help. American O&#38;P will be there, deployed in part by our own government, in part by other governments, in part by the United Nations, and not infrequently by caring organizations unwilling to wait for any of the above. Some experienced practitioners will be paid by governments. Some practitioners and even students will volunteer as part of larger teams of medical doctors. All will use CAD-CAM technologies to order prostheses fabricated by regional facilities networked around the globe or perhaps mobile containers airlifted or sealifted to trouble spots. <P>Years of local follow-up will be provided by prosthetic assistants or prosthetic nurses remaining in war-torn sectors of Africa and Asia. These assistants shall be as capable and all-encompassing as circumstances demand. They will service, adjust, reorder and replace, all under the supervision of certified prosthetists in two-way computer linkups. The supervising prosthetist may be at Duke University, a private shop in Dallas, or he may be one of the growing cadre of internationally certified practitioners who will emerge from a future campaign by ISPO and the World Health Organization. Whoever it is, the practitioner will operate from a hi-tech Global Prosthetic Network facility, moving between large TV screens displaying scanned and stored patient information beneath real-time satellite transmissions from the field unit. This communications technology will have been funded by Otto Bock, USMC, or Hanger, or some mega-conglomerate not yet conceived. Economics will drive the computer links since the company with the telecommunication links shall provide the products from its diverse fabrication centers. Overseeing case after case from screen after screen--one moment in Iraq, another in Cambodia, and yet another in Sri Lanka--will tire the practitioner. He will sleep in a lab bunk during duty periods. When he gets home he will grumble that he is sick of war in Africa, longs for the day when he can work in a small shop fitting artificial limbs like his father used to do, see his daughter play outside again, and pretend he's okay. 
<H2>Industrial Accidents</H2>
If O&#38;P understands war as its unhappy milestone, it must also understand industrial accidents as a major area of need. During the 20th Century, farming, construction, and manufacturing accidents created a never-ending need for the services of O&#38;P as people's limbs were shorn and their bodies bent. America is now rushing into the Information Age. That's here.
<P>But in the 21st Century along the Pacific Rim, in Latin America, throughout Micronesia, in the depths of the Asian subcontinent, and even throughout developing Africa, the Second Industrial Revolution will spread like an iron and concrete fungus across former rain forests, deserts, wetlands, and mountain ranges. Some will resemble giant prison camps, others will rise against the sky like dark fortresses--their fuming smokestacks reaching for the heavens. The compulsion to compete, fueled by the consuming world's need for goods, will catapult the Third World into a new Second World within a single generation. And what will they make?
<P>Shoes, of course. And handbags. And cars. And computers. And travel clocks. And computer chips. And everything else.
<P>The workers will be lured, compelled, purchased, or captured. Great Britain impressed seaman to supply its merchant marine. White South Africa used a nation of natives to scrape its diamond billions from the earth. The United States purchased African slaves to pick its cotton fields, indentured Cantonese to build its railroads, and even today tolerates sweat shops and slave work gangs so we can buy sweaters on sale and enjoy tables promptly bussed at our favorite restaurants. Even today, Koreans, Indians, Chinese, and others have organized monstrous Asians work camps where children work 15-hour days looming carpets that end up in midtown Manhattan, and trapped village women make running shoes that feed the bank accounts of basketball stars and footwear moguls. Less than 20 years ago, I went undercover to break up an Australian slave state on the Cocos Islands where generations of slaves were bred to produce the richest palm oil in the world. In the next century, slave labor will go beyond menial labor. Slaves will becomes highly skilled; the best will be high-tech serfs.
<P>In the new Second World in the new century, there will be no unions, no OSHA. Without standards, the world will see an explosion of accidents at special Industrial Enterprise Zones, not a few located on Devil's Island or Alcatraz Island-type locales. Mechanical accidents, chemical explosions, and fires will occur regularly and will be callously endured as a cost of doing business, the way the auto industry calculates and accepts a level of injuries to save five dollars on bumpers. Most mechanical accidents will be to upper limbs but they will take lower limbs as well.
<P>As the Second Industrial Revolution hits full force, office and residential building construction will occur on a scale only dreamed of by science fiction writers. A collection of 200 and 300 story self-contained structures will rise in Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Japan. Most will be anchored offshore. They will take decades to complete as module after module is attached. Many are on the drawing boards now and several are scheduled to commence before the decade is over. Standards will be shoddy and unregulated. Construction accidents will create a stream of amputations and broken bodies. The type of sudden building collapse witnessed in Korea will spread throughout Asia. 
<P>Once again, the greater need will exist outside the United States. When the outcry is sufficient, the SIR Lords (Second Industrial Revolution Lords) will begin to import well-paid O&#38;P practitioners, much as industry now imports medical teams to serve oil rigs, pipeline gangs, and other isolated construction projects. These O&#38;P practitioners sometimes will be solo practitioners, but more often will be hired through healthcare delivery consortia. At first, the victims of these accidents simply will be released into the general population. Quickly, that will create even greater local outcry. At that point, the SIR Lords will create long-term follow-up facilities in major urban centers where computers, CAD-CAM, and telecommunications will allow on-site O&#38;P practitioners to supervise O&#38;P assistants and nurses.
<H2>Longevity</H2>
Man will live longer in the 21st Century. But for many the quality of life will not necessarily be better. Life expectancy will continue to rise and not a few born in the next few years will undoubtedly see the dawn of the 22nd Century before they die. Their mobility issues will be extraordinarily complex. Some of them will be confined to mini-motorized vehicles, others will routinely face the replacement of a limb or the fitting of an orthosis with no greater trepidation than an organ transplant recipient. <P>At the same time, many who would have fallen through society's most forgotten cracks just a few years ago are now becoming enabled and productive citizens. I remember one of my first investigative articles more than 25 years ago about the routine termination of spina bifida newborns. Doctors routinely starved them to death. Just 10 years ago, I was writing about spina bifida skiers. In the next century, even more non-traumatic patients will access O&#38;P care, and the circle of biomechanical enablement will again spread across oceans. 
<H2>Deferred Health Care</H2>
Moreover, in the first decades of the 21st Century, the medical establishment will come face to face with an explosion of lower extremity pathology arising from deferred and denied healthcare in this decade and the next. An increase in undertreated diabetes, circulatory problems, osteoarthritis, and other problems will be the tip of the iceberg of mismanaged care. As it melts, its hidden tragedies will be uncovered.
<P>Our aging society will make O&#38;P a priority. But global economics will again play a role. Managed care entities and their successors may find it expedient to import cadres of low-cost O&#38;P practitioners from India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria, just as has been done with nurses and software programmers. It will become a major challenge for the American O&#38;P movement to maintain its global relevance and superiority--even to stay in demand within the U.S.
<P>There will be no shortage of O&#38;P needs, both in this country and globally. But will the O&#38;P community be able to think globally, cast off its inwardness, and rethink its place in the planet's healthcare delivery system? O&#38;P will have to confront new economics, new technology, new organization, new standards, new delivery, new demands, and even a new rate of newness. Change will come faster than our ability to adapt. Change must be anticipated. 
<P>Change or be changed.
<P>And when you contemplate the future, the wars not yet waged, the medical tragedies not yet discovered, the epidemic of accidents not yet recorded, pause with a prayer. The bad news is the outlook is good.

<H3>Shock Forces</H3>
Shock forces are a product of mass (weight) and velocity (speed). If you can slow rebound velocity and alter its direction, you dampen and dissipate shock forces.
<P>
<H3>You Be the Judge</H3>
Make your own shock attenuating tests by pressing your thumb into the center of shock absorbing heel pads and cups, then withdraw it rapidly. If you can see the material slowly return to normal at a speed that would let it fully recover just in time for the next heel strike, then maximum shock force reduction has been achieved. If the material rebounds instantly, the shock force has not been dampened but instead has been returned up through the skeletal structure.

Liquid PQ has proven itself as the most accommodative foot comfort product ever developed. Orthotists, podiatrists, pedorthists, orthopedic shoe technicians, coaches and physical therapists all around the country have discovered the many unique properties of liquid PQ. Aiding in the recovery of diabetic patients with open lesions, accommodating arthritics with severe deformities and helping professional athletes achieve better performance with less bone jarring strain, PQ is unsurpassed in absorbing shock and shearing forces. Moldable into any shape quickly and simply with a little practice, PQ has proven itself to be an important new development in the foot comfort field.

<H2>Now Even More Simple</H2>
The original instructions called for warming the two-part liquid to 110 degrees before mixing them and using two cups for mixing. Now it's room temperature and one cup mixing for easy, simple and fast custom accommodations.
<P>
Multiple durometer materials all out of the same 2-quart kit. By varying the ratio of Part A (the hardener) with Part B (the base), any durometer of cured material is possible--from soft jelly to very hard, and anything in between. The durometer can be calculated to best accommodate patients' needs based upon their weight, condition, activities, and shoe size.

<H2>General Guidelines in Choosing Durometer</H2>
Patients are divided into three general classes, then further divided by weight. Inlays must be formatted so they are firm enough to not bottom out under body weight and create pressure points. But for delicate conditions, they should be as soft as possible without danger of bottoming out. Ideally the patient is literally floating--with totally uniform weight bearing. Shoe or foot size is a factor to consider in using these guidelines. The larger foot has greater plantar surface area and in some cases you may want to go down to the next ratio on the chart.
<P>
<B>Class 1 patients</B>
<UL>Very sensitive or insensitive feet and all patients with open lesions.</UL>

<B>Class 2 patients</B>
<UL>Patients suffering foot strain and in need of maximum shock absorption due to type of activity such as walking, standing, running and exercising on firm surfaces.</UL>

<B>Class 3 patients</B>
<UL>Patients who need firm support that will be long lasting, durable and custom contoured for uniform weight bearing.</UL>

<P>
These guidelines were established after working with patients daily over a period of two years. These ratios and durometers proved to yield optimum results in patient comfort, accommodation and durability. However individual cases can vary a great deal depending upon a patient's condition, foot size, type of activity, etc. Experience with the materials will aid in these determinations.

<H2>Formulation and Mixing</H2>
This is the most important part of the operation. In order to obtain uniform and consistent results, you must be thorough and diligent.

<P>
There will be some waste using this chart on small inlays. On larger inlays like full-length men's larger than size 10, you should probably measure and mix the correct amounts to avoid having to double pour--although this works fine when needed. PQ adheres to itself and can be added to as needed as long as it is clean and dry. In fact dual density inlays are possible. When making large inlays using this method, pour both inlays first, using a single cup on each, then mix a third cup to top off both inlays. You may want to make the third cup a firmer mixture to cover the bottoms.

<H2>Some Recommended Covering Materials</H2>
There are numerous fine materials available today. In choosing materials, the concerns are patient comfort, moldability and durability. The most accommodative covers are unfortunately the least durable.
<P>
<B>Type 1 Patients</B>
<UL>Medium Pink Plastazote 1/8" or 1/4"</UL>
<B>Type 2 Patients</B>
<UL>1/16" Durmoplast, 1/8" Pelite Medium, Aliplast 6A T.P. Foam</UL>
<B>Type 3 Patients</B>
<UL>T.P. Foam, Aliplast 10, Firm Plastazote, Leather</UL>

<H2>For Most Accurate Measuring and Uniform Results</H2>
Measuring the correct amount of each part is best accomplished with a 3 Beam Balance, which measures to .10 of a gram and a transparent graduated measuring cup. The graduated cup can be used without a scale when consistency and accuracy are not extremely important. But to obtain uniformly accurate and consistent results, you need both the transparent measuring cup and a good scale.

<H2>Determining Total Amount to Mix Without Waste</H2>
First you must decide the total amount of PQ to be mixed. This can be done initially by filling your mold cavity with water using a syringe, then drawing it out into a measuring cup. This will prevent a lot of waste. After awhile you will be able to closely estimate the total amount needed. But never try to guess the pouring of the two parts into a cup. These MUST be calculated correctly.

<H2>Figuring the Ratio of A to B</H2>
Once you have determined the total amount to be mixed and the desired durometer, use this formula in your calculator: total amount divided by 1, plus Part A = Part B. (Total amount/1 + Part A = Part B) Example: Total needed = 100cc. The ratio chosen by experience or by consulting the Guideline Chart above we determine to be .85 Part A to 1 Part B. CAUTION: many mistakes are made at this point by people who determine this to mean that Part A is 85 percent of Part B and mix 85cc of Part A with 15cc of Part B or vice versa. This is wrong and will not work. Your mixture will be too hard or too soft. You must use the formula: total amount divided by 1, plus the Ratio = B. Therefore we divide 100cc by 1.85 = 54.05cc Part B. Now if you subtract Part B from the total 100cc, you see Part A = 45.95cc. Simplifying: This sounds more complicated than it is. In actual practice it isn't necessary to figure the amount of Part A needed. You simply use the formula to determine Part B by dividing the total by 1 plus the ratio. Pour this amount into your cup, then fill the cup to the total amount needed with Part A.

<H2>Using a Balance Scale</H2>
This is the best and most accurate way to measure correctly. Most fortunately, 1cc of PQ equals approximately one gram. Set your empty cup on the scale and adjust the fine balance adjustment to zero on the scale, then using the example above, you would set the weight to 54 grams. Then watching closely on the calibrated scale of the cup so you can judge when you are at 54cc, begin pouring Part B very slowly. Fill to the point where the scale balances, then advance the weights to 100 grams and fill the rest of the way with Part A until the scale balances. You are then ready to mix.

<H2>Mixing Thoroughly is Very Important</H2>
Use wood tongue depressors as disposable stir sticks. Always cut the end off square so you can scrape the sides and the bottom thoroughly. You stir and turn and scrape and then clean the stick off on the edge of the cup so it cleans off into the cup. Do the above until you can feel the mixture start to firm up. You have plenty of time to pour even after you feel it start to thicken. It is very important that all of Part A is dispersed into Part B--otherwise the cured product will have uncured lines which bleed out Part B. So don't take the stirring and scraping lightly! It's VERY IMPORTANT that it be done THOROUGHLY BEFORE POURING.

<H2>Grinding and Finishing PQ</H2>
The finished, cured PQ products can be sanded into finished form for fine tuning by first freezing the material. When frozen, even the very soft durometer pads can be sanded easily. Firm PQ--90 to 1 and firmer--sands pretty well without freezing.

<H2>Super Light-Weight Inlays</H2>
To make super lightweight inlays and stretch your liquid PQ, you may use ground cork as a filler. This mixture of liquid PQ and ground cork cures at room temperature in approximately 30 minutes. It is lightweight and grinds well. The cork floats enough that a thin layer of pure PQ cures next to the cover. The inlays when cured are still flexible and shock and shear absorbing--not as much as the pure PQ, but for many cases where support is the main factor, this makes a superior inlay to the old cork and latex mix.
<P>
PQ has many other uses in footwear. We learn more almost every week.

<H2>A Few Other Common Uses</H2>
<B>Heel Spur Relief</B>
<BR>As you possibly know, sometimes when you put a Spur Pad under a patient's heel, the heel pad thickness lifts patients off the longitudinal support of the shoe, thus increasing the strain on the plantar fascia and sometimes increasing heel pain. This negative result can be avoided by using a hole saw to relieve an area around and under the spur to a depth of 1/4" to 1/2", then filling this hole with soft durometer PQ.

<P>
<B>Painful Metatarsal Heads</B>
<BR>The technique above can be used to make even dress footwear more comfortable for those who suffer from painful metatarsal heads. Mark the spot on the insole of the shoes by using a touch of lipstick on the patient's socks or hose, directly under the painful metatarsal heads. Then locate this spot on the sole of the shoe by sticking a sharp awl through from the bottom of the sole until you have located the center of the point. Then use a hole saw again to drill completely through the sole, the filler and the insole. Put a thin sole on top of the old sole or a thin sole saver of long-wearing rubber. You now have a hole approximately 3/8" deep inside, under the metatarsal heads--even in thin-soled dress shoes. Now sand the inside edges of the hole smooth and rounded and fill this hole to slightly over full with soft durometer liquid PQ. An 85 to 1 mixture is usually about right. Cover this after it is cured with a thin 4-way stretch material like 1/16" durmoplast and you have made a very comfortable accommodation. It is wise to back this up with a metatarsal pad so you can prevent the metatarsal heads from dropping out of alignment.
<P>
<P>
The uses of PQ are limited only by your imagination. It makes wonderfully accommodating custom distal end pads for amputees. You will discover many uses for it as you become familiar with its many fine properties.
<P>
The following picture story shows the most common method used to make custom inlays from foot forms. 

<P>
<IMG SRC="/mall/rieckens/fab1.jpg" WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=104>
<BR>
<B>The Bare Foot Form</B>
<BR>Start with a proper foot form--we recommend compression casting with wax sheets on a sand bed to obtain uniform weight bearing and eliminate pressure points. This foot form has a prominent second metatarsal head which is bearing an abnormal amount of weight. It has been relieved posteriorly so that the finished PQ inlay will lift some weight from it as well as have an accommodative pocket under the metatarsal head. This foot form was cast with the toes blanked off. The smooth toe inlay allows for foot expansion and wearing heavy socks. It is recommended for most full-length inlays.

<P>
<IMG SRC="/mall/rieckens/fab2.jpg" WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=104>
<BR><B>Foot Form on Vacuum Former</B>
<BR>The foot form is placed in a vacuum former and a hot moldable sheet of cover material is formed to it. The cover can be of any heat moldable thermoplastic material which has the desired properties. Plastazote is recommended for plantar ulcer patients. The material should have 4-way stretch to take full advantage of the PQ's properties.

<P>
<IMG SRC="/mall/rieckens/fab3.jpg" WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=104>
<BR><B>Foot Form with Cover Molded On</B>
<BR>This picture shows the cover molded down tightly. It is recommended that a few tacks be placed around the perimeter to hold it securely in place while making it into an inlay.

<P>
<IMG SRC="/mall/rieckens/fab4.jpg" WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=104>
<BR><B>Foot form with line of insole drawn on</B>
<BR>Take the insole from a previously fitted extra-depth shoe and draw an outline on the cover as a guide to the inlay's size.

<P>
<IMG SRC="/mall/rieckens/fab5.jpg" WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=104>
<BR><B>Cementing edging strip on</B>
<BR>Cement the edging on the inlay on the line from Picture No. 4. The edging strip forms a tray to hold the liquid PQ. 1-1/2" wide stripping works well.

<P>
<IMG SRC="/mall/rieckens/fab6.jpg" WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=104>
<BR><B>With levels on foot forms</B>
<BR>The foot form is then leveled so the liquid PQ will flow to proper thickness at all desired points. It is helpful to set tacks to the proper heights at these points to use as depth gauges. When shoe depth allows, make PQ depth at heel a full 1/4" for maximum shock absorption.

<P>
<IMG SRC="/mall/rieckens/fab7.jpg" WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=104>
<BR><B>PQ Cup on Scale</B>
<BR>After deciding the amount needed and the ratio of Part A to Part B in order to make the proper durometer, you are ready to measure Part B into the mixing cup. The most accurate way is to use a gram scale. It is helpful to use transparent calibrated measuring cups. They let you see when you are close to your mark so you can pour accurately. When you reach the balance point with Part B, advance the weights to the total amount needed and pour in the Part A until balance is again reached. You are now ready to stir the mixture thoroughly until it begins to thicken before pouring it into your inlay tray. We recommend mixing and pouring each inlay separately. Pour until you reach the top of the tack heads--your depth gauges.

<P>
<IMG SRC="/mall/rieckens/fab8.jpg" WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=104>
<BR><B>Pouring PQ into trays</B>
<BR>The PQ pours easily into the foot form trays--you have plenty of time before curing--so distribute it around so it doesn't have to flow too far. Bring it up to your depth gauge tack heads, let it set and cure. When cured enough to remove from the foot form, usually approximately 30 minutes, the surface will be tacky--just sprinkle lightly with talcum powder and rub in. It's a good idea to talc the shoes before insertion of the inlays and again after washing.

<P>
<IMG SRC="/mall/rieckens/fab9.jpg" WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=104>
<BR><B>Trimming off excess</B>
<BR>The PQ cures to a workable condition in about 30 minutes. You are ready to remove it from the foot form and trim off excess covering material. These inlays should cure overnight before being dispersed, but they are ready to trim out when they come off the forms. For very soft durometer, you may want to put them in the freezer overnight and freeze them in order to remove any excess PQ material by sanding.

<P>
<IMG SRC="/mall/rieckens/fab10.jpg" WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=104>
<BR><B>Sanding edges</B>
<BR>The edging strip can be sanded to just a very thin edge covering after trimming off the excess with scissors. Then the inlays need to be balanced to fit the contour of the shoe it is to be worn in. The shanks need to be ground to fit the curvature of the shank of the shoe without disturbing the shape of the surface of the inlay.

<P>
<IMG SRC="/mall/rieckens/fab11.jpg" WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=104>
<P><IMG SRC="/mall/rieckens/fab12.jpg" WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=104>
<BR><B>Finished Inlay</B>
<BR>These flexible inlays actually serve as interfacings. They fit the foot's contours on one side and the shoe's insole contours on the other. They essentially make a custom molded shoe out of ready-made footwear. They should be worn in wedge-type shoes or shoes with good strong shanks. Flexible shank shoes will need some shank reinforcement. 3mm subortholene serves well for this purpose. It can be heated until flexible and allowed to cool lying on the insole where it will take its shape and become firm.
<P>

The SAFIO process represents the future in custom molded foot orthoses. It provides the missing dimensions and shapes that have long eluded the professions who work in the area of shoe fitting, custom molded foot  orthoses and prostheses. These are generally orthotists, prosthetists, podiatrists and pedorthists. This process simplifies and reduces the time expense in making custom accommodations. It eliminates the need to make negative casts or positive foot forms. At the same time it improves patient comfort by improving fit and function.

<P>SAFIO is an acronym formed from the first letter of each word in the longer name, "Shoe And Foot Interfacing Orthosis."  A SAFIO is a custom molded orthosis that provides accommodative support, relief from pressure and high pressure areas, and aids foot function.  It provides protection and pressure  relief for such abnormalities as corns, calluses, bunions, ulcer areas and other excrescencies.  Additionally it includes filler for foot size differences caused by amputations or congenital differences making mismated feet into matched, mated shapes.  It also provides cushioning to protect the foot from the forces of shock and shear, and if needed, postings of various types to assist function.  A SAFIO becomes an interfacing to mate the foot shape , size, and width to a standard ready-made shoe. In some cases a SAFIO becomes a prosthesis to be worn directly on the foot under the patient's hose or socks.  In other cases it becomes an orthosis that can be changed from shoe to shoe as long as the shoes are the same size, width, and last. A SAFIO can be used with or without a covering on the body of the SAFIO. Every type  of covering material inhibits shock and shear force absorption and dissipation properties of visco elastic body materials to some extent. A SAFIO can become a supplementary synthetic body tissue. A SAFIO is formed over a foot placed inside a transparent plastic casting shell--a casting shell that has been made over the same last as the shoe the patient is going to wear.  This process assures a proper matching of the patient's foot size and shape for a comfortable and functional accommodation. 

<P>It is quite often necessary to make a SAFIO for both feet, even if one foot is asymptomatic, in order to make both feet the same size, width, and shape to fit a matched pair of ready-made shoes. This increases the cost but enhances the patient comfort.
<CENTER>
<H2>Preface</H2>
</CENTER>
Foot pain is the most common physical complaint of mankind.  The reasons are many and varied.  To begin with feet are as individual as snowflakes.  It's very doubtful if there is a perfectly matched pair of feet anywhere in the world. In 1982 the national Prescription Footwear Association completed the measurement of 6,800 pairs of adult men and women's feet in 23 cities.  Not a single perfectly matched pair was found. 

<P>Feet are very complicated and very delicate, yet they do tremendous work. They make it possible for man to overcome the enormous forces of gravity, and walk or run upright with great efficiency. To think for a minute that you can walk to a shoe store and find a pair of shoes made in some distant factory by people who have never seen your feet and get a perfect fit is absolutely ludicrous. One of the nation's foremost footwear authorities, Doctor William Rossi, is author of the book <CITE>Podometrics</CITE>, a book dealing with foot measures as related to lasts, shoes, sizes and fit. In a June 1983 article in <CITE>Leather &#38; Shoes</CITE>, Rossi wrote that "Perfect Shoe Fit" is impossible and "correct shoe" fit is improbable. He lists some 37 factors that affect fit.  A perfect fit is not possible even in custom-made shoes because the foot keeps changing. It is one shape at non weight-bearing rest--called static fit--and another shape at full weight-bearing. Then it changes shapes dramatically in functional fit, which is the foot in motion--walking, running, and jumping.  No shoe or shoe material can match these changes 100 percent.  Lastly there is thermal fit.  Under different conditions of heat, cold and humidity the foot volume changes enough to make an otherwise reasonably good fit either too tight or too loose. 

<P>Every experienced shoe person knows that every pair of shoes fitted is a compromise of some type.  Most are afraid to tell this to their customer because the minute they suggest putting in a pad or making a shoe modification of some type the customer recoils and says, "There must be something wrong with this shoe because my feet are fine." But are they really? If you could see them barefoot you might see toes and or joints that have suffered great abuse from shoe pressure and friction, red swollen joints, heavy areas of calluses, and toes with painful corns.  You question them and you hear, "Oh, it's been that way for years," or "I was misfit once," or a whole list of similar stories.  Sometimes you will hear my right foot is slightly larger and I have to buy it too small or the left slips at the heel.  It would make an interesting candid camera show to see and listen to all the strange tales of why people's feet are so mistreated. 

<P>The answer is very simple: shoes are made in standard sizes and feet are not standard at all.  When shoes fail to fit properly they can cause abrasions and contusions that develop into painful corns, calluses, hammer toes and bunions. If shoes fail to support the foot's skeletal structure properly, many additional problems result. Perhaps the worst problems are high pressure areas caused by tight shoes or extreme pressure on joints.  This causes ischemia that leads to necrosis of tissue, that, without relief, can develop into open ulcers and sometimes infections that lead to amputations.

<P>To this point we have been describing average normal adult feet.  When you consider additionally the feet that would not be considered average, normal adult feet, but instead fall into the following categories you begin to see how serious this problem is world wide. First there are many types of congenital deformities. Broadly covered, these are feet misshapened and or mis-mated from what we consider normal.  Then there are feet that have suffered traumatic injury from some type of accident.  There are many partial feet in this group.  Last there are the many feet that have been ravaged by some type of disease, such as diabetes or arthritis.  According to the American Diabetes Association's publication <CITE>Diabetic Foot Care</CITE>, published June of 1990, diabetes is responsible for 50 to 70 percent of all nontraumatic foot amputations. They estimate there are some 50,000 diabetic foot amputations per year. They have set a goal to reduce this figure by 50 percent and further state that this has been achieved at some institutions by proper intervention, foot care and education.  Last we have the effects of aging.  The geriatric patient quite often suffers the loss of protective fatty tissue from the joints and metatarsal heads of their feet, making it painful to ambulate.

<P>The point of all of  is that feet deserve proper care.  They are far too valuable to well-being and general overall health to abuse.  Foot abuse sometimes takes years to turn into a  serious functional problem, but when it happens the whole body is affected.

<P>There are many types of foot remedies--some ready made, some custom made, but there are two outstanding obstacles that interfere with the success of these products. First there is the problem for the orthotic technician making soft or flexible orthotics of matching the orthosis to the contouring of the insole of the shoe it is to be worn in as well as the foot's plantar surface.  This takes considerable skill and some art work.  If these two surfaces fail to mate perfectly the orthosis will distort under body weight and take the shape of the shoe, thus losing accommodation.  This problem has not been properly addressed until now.

<P>The second major problem is the fact that the foot doesn't always fall into the range of standard shoe size, widths, and last shapes, and even with a custom-made orthosis quite often still does not.  This will mean that the orthosis may help with symptoms but does not address the cause of the problem, but many people are not aware of it.  However we do have quite a number of companies and individuals in America and world-wide who make custom shoes because of this problem of non-standard size feet.

<P>The SAFIO process will make it possible to accommodate many people in ready-made shoes, who now must have their shoes custom made. This will greatly increase their shoe style selection and reduce their cost.  The SAFIO process will make it possible to make thousands of people comfortable in ready-made shoes, who are borderline as to being properly fit in ready-made shoes presently.  Additionally there are thousands of people who badly need custom-made shoes but cannot afford them and have suffered greatly as a result. With the SAFIO process many of them will be able to be fitted comfortably in ready-made shoes.

<CENTER>
<H2>The SAFIO Manufacturing Process</H2>
</CENTER>
This process is now possible by the development of modern materials and technology.

<P><B>Main Components</B>
<UL>
1. A liquid polymer that can cold cure in a short time at normal room temperature to form a shock and shear absorbing jell or foam of synthetic urethane or silicone rubber. PQ (1) is one such brand of urethane visco elastic polymer.</UL>
<UL>2. A selection of transparent plastic SAFIO casting shells made over shoe lasts of ready-made shoes--preferably depth type shoes (2). These are described in detail below.</UL>
<UL>3. A selection of die cut insoles that fit into the sole plate of the plastic shells. They should be made of the material that will form the bottom of the SAFIO. The material must be compatible with the liquid polymers used so they can be bonded together.</UL>
<UL>4. A selection of ready-made metatarsal pads, scaphoid pads, and heel wedges, plus some sheet stock of various thicknesses of compatible material should be available. These items are for various postings.</UL>
<UL>5. It would be desirable for the facility making the SAFIOs to have an inventory of depth-type footwear in stock.  An inventory should include shoes made on at least two or three different lasts and a wide range of sizes and widths.</UL>

<CENTER>
<H2>Supplemental Tools, Equipment, and  Supplies</H2>
</CENTER>
A facility setting up to make SAFIOs should have for the most part the same facilities, equipment, tools, and materials that present foot orthotic laboratories have, including the following items. 
<UL>1.  A supply of disposable 250 ml calibrated measuring cups. 
<BR>2.  A supply of disposable stir sticks with a square end and edge. <BR>3.  An optional three beam scale that measures to 1/10 of a gram. 
<BR>4.  Caulking cartridges with plastic snouts and a caulking gun. 
<BR>5.  Optional:  Liquid polymer pumps and automatic mixing system. 
<BR>6.  Transparent plastic sealing tape. 
<BR>7.  Grinding or sanding machine.  A belt sander would be preferred. 
<BR>8.  A supply of silicone mold release. 
<BR>9.  A quart of all purpose neoprene cement with cement brush.
<BR>10. A container of talcum powder.
<BR>11. A supply of latex casting balloons.
<BR>12. Marking pencils and or crayons.
<BR>13. A casting platform preferably with a hydraulic chair.
<BR>14. A low foot stool, with rollers, for the technician
<BR>15. A supply of paper towels.
<BR>16. A pair of curved blade surgical scissors with a serrated edge.
<BR>17. Some children's play dough, modeling clay and or cotton.
</UL>

<CENTER>
<H2>The SAFIO Transparent Plastic Casting Shells</H2>
</CENTER>
These shells may or may not be made at the facility that is making the SAFIO. They are so inexpensive that they could be disposable, but in most cases can and probably should be reused from the standpoint of economy and efficiency. However a facility that makes SAFIOs would not necessarily have to be set up to make these shells.  They could be manufactured by the shoe company that makes the shoes and probably should be as they already own the correct shoe lasts.  It may be, however, that a company or companies will be formed to make and sell these shells and other supplies, as well as offer training in the manufacture of SAFIOs.  Eventually they may become supplies that are sold through existing orthopedic supply houses.

<CENTER>
<H2>Making the SAFIO Casting Shells</H2>
</CENTER>
There are many ways to make these casting shells.  The following method is possibly one of the simplest. The shell's lower half, which serves as the base, can be made of semirigid thermal moldable transparent plastic such as G.E.'s Lexan that is a polycarbonate, or a high density polyethylene.  These materials are very strong when formed into complex shapes so the material itself can be very thin--.060" works well.  The upper half of the casting shell should be somewhat more flexible so that it will form around the patient's ankle easily. It works well molded from .060" low density polyethylene.

<P>A Vacuum Forming Machine is used to form the heated shell parts over a shoe last of a style that is used to manufacture depth type footwear or a regular shoe last that has an extra sole plate attached.  The shell formed over this last or last and sole plate will provide room for the material to be used under the foot's plantar surface to accommodate any deformities needing accommodation, plus room for material to cushion and absorb shock and shearing forces. The shells are formed in two or more parts. Two parts would be the optimum for most needs. First a sole plate base is cast.  This is done by inverting the last in a sand casting box and pouring a suitable casting material such as Liquid Last (3) over it to form a model.  This base must have the proper heel height for the last to be cast in it.  The edges of the base should turn up around the sides of the last to the last's widest perimeter, leaving a rim along the edge of the last for the upper half of the casting shell to mate with.  This base of liquid last can be used as the finished base. It is, however, a nontransparent, solid, heavy block of expansive material, so for production purposes it is modified slightly and used as a master mold for forming the production casting shell bases on a vacuum forming machine. The upper half is then formed extending from the edge of the sole plate, overlaying the sole plate edging and covering the top of the last.  This piece is then trimmed around the crown of the last and down a back seam allowance formed as a web by a parting flange attached to the back of the last for this purpose.  This makes a complete enclosure except at the very top or crown of the last where the opening for the foot is.  These two parts will fit together nicely so that a leak-tight seal is made at the seams. They are fastened together by small expandable plastic panel fasteners. After the shell halves are trimmed, holes are drilled for the fasteners and on the base half at the medial arch area a hole will be drilled to accommodate a filler tube for injecting the filler materials.

<P>In the orthopedic footwear industry most of the problems that require depth-type footwear can be accommodated in 1/4" of depth; some require 3/8" and some of the more extreme require up to 1/2".  The majority of depth type footwear made is of the 1/4" depth-type. Therefore if an inventory of SAFIO casting shells were to be made it would be prudent to make them with 1/4" of depth.  For special conditions requiring more depth, a shim gasket of the appropriate thickness can be made and attached to the Casting Shell base on the sealing rim. Special shoes would have to be made with this additional depth in them, of course.

<P>Lasts are made very narrow through the Cones Surface Area (4) to assure a snug fit at the top line of shoes made over them. SAFIO Casting Shells may have to adjusted in this area to allow proper foot entry into the shell.

<P>After the casting shell is made it should be very clearly marked with its size and width so there can be no confusion created.

<CENTER>
<H2>SAFIO Casting Shells Have Multiple Uses</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>1. SIZING.</B> In orthopedic shoe facilities the casting shells can be used as trial fitters to establish the patient's shoe size and width.  Shoe measuring devices are not always accurate and interpreting their readings is a very subjective process. It is sometimes difficult to convince a patient that they need a particular size and width.  With transparent plastic casting shells it is easy to demonstrate their correct size.  The casting shell base alone lets you see at a glance once a foot is placed in it if the size is proper. These bases would be of great assistance as fitting devices in all shoe stores--even self services stores.  They would be very superior to the old x-ray machines that were so widely hailed but proved to be a health hazard and didn't properly display soft tissue. 

<P>It is sad to note in this enlightened age a majority of the public is wearing improper or improperly sized footwear. A study released March 10, 1991 by The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society shows most women suffer disabling foot problems from wearing shoes too small for their feet. The study team was headed by Dr. Carol Frey, who is Chief of Foot and Ankle Surgery at the University of Southern California and Assistant Professor of Orthopaedics at USC School of Medicine. She and other members of the AOFAS Women's Footwear Committee determined that eight out or 10 women wear shoes too small, leading to the development of foot abnormalities and pain.

<P>Ideally the insole of a shoe has a weight bearing surface area equal in size and shape to the wearer's plantar surface area with a little extra toe room for elongation in walking.  Unfortunately this is not the case in large percentages of the footwear sold.  Instead for fashion purposes (the narrow trim look) many shoes are designed to be worn with the edges of the foot extending over the edges of the insoles and even beyond the edges of the soles.  This gives the foot an unsupported hangover along the edge.  This results in tissue trauma and abrasion.  Some shoes with molded unit bottoms have a sharp lip molded along the edge of the sole unit.  This extends upward to seal the crack that is otherwise formed at the juncture of the unit sole and upper.  With the foot extending over the edge of this lip the trauma is greatly increased.

<P>By using the bottom selection of the SAFIO Casting Shell as a sizing device it is easy to demonstrate the proper insole size and shape needed for comfort and function purposes.

<P><B>2. FIT.</B> The SAFIO Process can be used to improve the fit and comfort of ready-made footwear to the point where it is comparable to the fit of custom footwear. This fit adjustment process is not an orthopedic or corrective process. It has no medical purpose. It therefore should not require a prescription or medical supervision. It is simply a way of improving the fit of ready-made footwear to accommodate those who cannot be fit properly otherwise.

<P>Many people have feet that are very thin in the vertical plane as compared to the width of their horizontal plane.  Their feet are outside the normal range of standard shoe sizes.  These people have to buy shoes too narrow to keep their shoes from being too full fitting.  This causes heel slippage, excess wrinkling of the uppers and other problems.  These people are a large part of the group who suffer from foot hangover because they must buy shoes too narrow for full plantar surface tread area.  By sizing these people in a SAFIO casting shell base you can determine the true insole size they need for comfort and proper function.  With the following method you can form insoles that will be the exact shape of their feet and are thick enough to take up the excess room in ready made shoes.

<CENTER>
<H2>Making Custom Insoles to Adjust Fit</H2>
</CENTER>
After the correct size shell has been selected, a plastic filler tube is inserted in the medial arch side of the base.  Then the insole from the matching depth type shoe is placed in the shell.  If the insole has arch flanges on it they should be trimmed off so that the insole will rest on the insole outline of the casting shell base.  Next a thin sock lining shell base cover is selected and placed over the base.  The patient's foot is then placed on the sock lining and the upper shell half is placed over the foot and secured onto the base with the fasteners.  At this point have the patient comfortably seated with only the weight of their foot and leg on the sock lining.  You are then ready to inject the filler material into the filler tube.  If the patient has normal sensation he or she will be able to feel the filler being injected.  The operator will be able to see the material flowing through the filler tube and into the casting shell's base.  Filler will flow into the voids under the sock lining and the foot will be forced by hydraulic pressure to rise in the casting shell.  At the same time all the voids under the plantar surface area will become filled, including the arch and metatarsal areas.  The insole will then fit the contours of the foot to improve comfort as well as serve as a fit-enhancing filler.  When the filler is sufficient to elevate the foot into the top shell enough to achieve proper fit, stop the filling operation and clamp off the filler tube.  After approximately 20 minutes of cure time the fasteners can be removed, the foot released, and the insole removed from the shell.  The insole is then trimmed of excess sock lining and when thoroughly cured is ready to place in the patient's shoes.

<P><B>3. MOLDING.</B> Casting shells may serve as a mold to cast, fabricate or heat-form custom orthoses for the foot's plantar surface area. This use of the shell is of a medical nature and probably would be performed at a foot clinic, orthotic laboratory or prescription shoe store.  In making some types of orthotics, only the base of the shell is needed.  In others the full shell is used. The possible shell uses for this purpose are numerous. The most common would be as follows.        

<UL>A. After the proper size shell has been selected it is used as a form in which to assemble needed modalities onto a full or partial insole to make a custom orthotic. Such things as metatarsal pads, heel wedges, and scaphoid pads can be assembled and fit-checked as the assembly progresses.  The casting shell assures the finished orthotic will fit properly into the patient's shoes. A thin sock lining can be cemented over the finished assembly, or to enhance patient comfort a thin layer of visco can be injected to flow over the finished assembly. This will make all the parts join smoothly and provide a shock absorbing layer under the sock lining.  The injection process is as described in the second use (Adjusting The Fit), except only a thin layer of visco is used.</UL>        

<UL>B. The casting shell bases are ideal for making heat molded foam orthoses. They are far superior to the present method of using a foam pillow to form materials such as the polyethylene foams like Plastazote.  Orthotics presently made using foam casting blocks must be hand-fitted to the shoes' contours.  The success of this is totally dependent upon the technician's skill and judgment. Forming an orthotic in a casting shell base assures superior matching of the shapes.</UL>        

<UL>C. A third method of forming custom molded orthotics is casting from liquid visco. This is accomplished by using the full shell, an insole and sock lining cover as in (Adjusting The Fit).  Have one technician hold the foot in correct alignment (as is done when casting for UCBLs.) while the second injects a mixture of visco which when cured will be very firm.  This process would be useful for hypermobile flat feet to make a strong supportive orthotic that would prevent rotation, extension and pronation.</UL>        

<UL>D. The three methods described above may be used in any combination with each other and or other methods and materials as needed. Such materials as fiberglass, graphite fiber, cloth, and polyester resin can be used to construct custom orthoses in these casting shells.  This is done with assurance that the finished orthoses will fit perfectly into the patient's shoes as long as they are made on the same last as the shell.</UL>     

<P><B>4. PARTIAL AMPUTATIONS.</B> The casting shell may be used to accommodate partial amputations and/or mis-mated foot conditions. We will call this type of accommodation a SAFIO. It was the need to improve on present methods that nourished the development of this process.
With this type of patient select the casting shells to fit the largest foot close so the smaller foot will not require any more filler than necessary.  It should be possible to accommodate feet that are mis-mated with as much as three sizes' different in a mated pair of shoes with this process.

<CENTER>
<H2>The Process Begins</H2>
</CENTER>
The first step in the construction of a SAFIO begins with a complete pedorthic examination of the patient. If the patient has been referred the first step would be to read and interpret the prescription.  The patient's medical history is recorded and all symptoms noted including any known allergies to cements and chemicals.  Pedograph prints are taken, and the feet measured relaxed, and with full weight bearing.  A thorough physical examination of the feet and lower limbs must be made, and a gait analysis performed.  If any leg length discrepancy is present note the amount.  Generally up to 1/4" of the leg length discrepancy can be accommodated in a SAFIO made for wearing in a standard oxford and up to 1/2" can be accommodated in a 6" shoe.  Determine what type of plantar abnormalities there are, if any, and how much depth will be needed under the plantar surface to accommodate them. Abnormalities are such things as mis-aligned metatarsal heads, arthritic nodules, Charcot joints, etc.  The general foot shape must be determined such as inflare, outflare, or straight, and the arch type such as pes planus, equinus or normal.  The patient's heel-to-ball measurement is recorded from a Brannock type shoe fitting device. All this information will be useful to determine the correct shoe last, size, width and depth of shoe and corresponding casting shell to be selected for a trial fitting. Pedorthic shoe fitting experience would be very helpful in this process. 

<P>After selecting the Casting Shell, place in the sole plate an insole of the correct thickness needed.  With the patient seated, place the patient's largest foot in the casting shell sole plate on the insole selected.  The ball of the foot should be located at the widest part of the sole plate.  There should be at least 1/2" of length ahead of the longest toe at the end of the sole plate. There should be at least 1/16" of space around the edges everywhere else if a full SAFIO is to be made for both feet. The foot's edges and heel dimensions can be fitted close if only the smaller foot is to receive a SAFIO.  Try on sizes until this specification is met as well as possible.  It would be best for the shell to be too large rather than too small.  There is some trial fitting involved in the selection process and it would be a good idea to try on the actual shoes which were made on the same lasts as the SAFIO shells before a final decision is made as to which shell or shells to use.  This is the partial SAFIO for one foot, or a pair of SAFIOs.  Selection of casting shells will become easier with experience.

<P>After the casting shell has been selected it must be determined if any posting is to be built into the SAFIO.  If posting is needed then it must be selected and assembled onto the insole that will become the base of the SAFIO.

<P>The actual procedure from this point will vary a great deal according to the foot condition to be accommodated.  Pedorthic experience will be very helpful in determining needs for any base materials to be assembled.  For instance if we are dealing with a plantar ulcer, an area of lesser pressure under the ulcer site would be desirable.  This is accomplished by use of a temporary filler patch over the ulcer site that is removed after the SAFIO is finished.  This procedure is outlined under preparing the patient.

<P>In many cases no posting will be needed, even for a full insole.  The technician will be able to greatly simplify the process and use small pieces of insoling as blocking to position the foot inside the casting shell.

<CENTER>
<H2>Final Preparations Before Injecting the Liquid Filler</H2>
</CENTER>
The casting shell is taken apart and the insole and postings removed.  The shell then needs a very light film of mold release applied inside and out.  The release used must be compatible with the body material selected.  If using PQ, the silicone release agent recommended would be type E-155 (5).  The release agent is best applied with a small sponge. Use it very sparingly. Be sure that every part of the shell has a light film.

<P>The insole, blocking and postings used must have their top sides and edges free of mold release and other contaminates.  They should be cleaned with a clean paper towel or lint-free cloth using either acetone or isopropyl alcohol as a solvent.  This is so the body material will bond to these parts.

<CENTER>
<H2>Preparing the Patient</H2>
</CENTER>
Before seating the patient on the casting platform they may want to visit the rest room as they will need to sit quietly for 30 to 40 minutes once the procedure starts.  A casting balloon will be inverted over the patient's foot to protect it from the liquid chemicals that will be used, as well as make clean up simple and easy. First the foot must be prepared.  If  there are any areas of the foot that need pressure relief, such as ulcer sites, they are prepared as follows. Use a piece of  sterile transparent plastic film. Place it over the site and draw an outline of its edge with a wax pencil. Now add a border of 3/8" to this drawing all the way around. This is now a pattern for a piece of flexible, non-compressible 1/8" thick sheet stock such as neolite soling. Cut out this shape and then sand or skive to a feather edge the added border area. This skived patch of soling will be cemented to the bottom of the casting balloon over the ulcer site with rubber glue. This is done after you have removed any bandaging or dressing and inverted a sterile casting balloon over the foot.  Casting balloons tend to pull the toes together and retract them.  Special care is taken to prevent this.  Toes can be separated by placing cotton balls between them; even better is children's play dough or modeling clay. Toe separators are put in place before the casting balloon is inverted over the foot.

<P>The only caution needed here is to not inflate the balloon all the way--leave at least 1" of uninflected tip on it.  After it is inverted over the foot this tip may be manually stretched out to give some toe freedom.  The toes should be as natural as possible inside the balloon covering.  If there is going to be a large amount of filler needed in one area such as a missing toe, it is a good idea to use a second injection tube.  Tape a 1/4" soft flexible plastic injection tube onto the balloon so that the end of it is positioned over this area.  When the foot is placed into the shell, thread the other end of the tube out of the shell opening at the medial ankle area.  The alternate to this would be to install a second injection tube in the shell at this point.  Now it is time to coat the balloon very lightly with mold release using the small sponge.  The patient is now ready.

<P>Place the previously prepared insoling, posting or blocking carefully into the casting shell sole plate.  Be sure not to get any mold release on the top or sides where you want bonding with the body material to occur.  Then place the patient's foot carefully back in place and reassemble the casting pillow between the patient's knees and secure them together with a strap as is common in casting for custom shoes.  This helps to hold them steady without strain. The lower legs should be vertical and the heel cords as straight as the patient can comfortably tolerate.  The feet should be as close as possible to the position known in the orthotic trade as neutral.  You are now ready to mix the polymer and inject it.

<P>In mixing these various polymers and silicones it is very important that you follow the mixing instructions of the material manufacturer very carefully. Different materials mix at different ratios and there are other differences as well. With the PQ you can vary the ratio of the two parts A and B to vary durometer of the finished cured synthetic rubber jell.  In the instruction sheets there is a chart that makes recommendations for selecting a durometer based upon the patient's condition, weight, and activity.  The quantity of material to mix is difficult to determine accurately.  Fortunately most of these materials adhere readily to themselves as long as the surfaces are fresh and clean.  It is easier therefore to mix small quantities and it's very important that the mix is thorough. It is simple and easy if you use disposable polyethylene measuring cups.  There is a quick mix chart in the <A HREF="/mall/rieckens/fabricate.html">PQ instructions.</A> As an example, to make a mixture of a durometer of 50 on the 00 scale, which is about the durometer of human fat tissue, you would pour in 100 ML of part B, then add 85 ML of part A. If this is insufficient to complete the SAFIO just mix another batch the same way and continue to fill the shell to the desired point. There may be some small amount of waste but not enough to be of concern.

<P>Start the injection process into the tube closest to the toe of the casting shell.  If the tube has been taped onto the casting balloon very lightly you may as the fill progresses slowly pull the tube out, filling the area in front of it as you go. When this tube is all the way out and has done its job, start injecting through the medial arch filler tube until the shell is as full as you want it. When the injection is finished, have the patient sit quietly until the injected material is cured. Test the remaining residue in the last mixing cup when it sits up so that when you stretch it and it returns 100% to its former shape the cure is complete.  The casting shell is then disassembled and the SAFIO removed from the patient's foot.  Now remove the casting balloon and the patient is free to move and be made comfortable. If the patient has an open ulcer, install a new sterile dressing and instruct the patient to clean, treat and redress the ulcer when they return home.

<CENTER>
<H2>Finishing the SAFIO</H2></CENTER>
When the SAFIO is removed from the patient's foot it needs to be washed in a detergent solution such as Tide and warm water.  Wash it well inside and out to remove the mold release--it will not hurt it to be submersed.  After washing, rinse it in cool water.  Just hold it under the faucet.  Now towel it dry.  At this point it is tacky and needs to be powdered freely with talc and the talc rubbed in to seal the surface.  This will make it comfortable to handle.  The SAFIO is now ready to be trimmed to a finished size and shape.  This is determined by the patient's condition or conditions.  If the patient needs only a total contact custom inlay type orthosis, then the trim line is along the thinnest area of the edge.  This will be approximately 1/2" to 3/4" up the side except at the arch and the toe.  The trim line will rise in the arch area to the height of the arch.  At the toe there will be a solid block of the toe filler, which ensures the position of the orthosis in the shoe.  It will not be able to slide around in the shoe as many orthotics do presently.  The trim at the toes will be along the top anterior edges of the toes.  There shouldn't be, but if there is any problem of the toe elongation the anterior area may be relieved later.

<P>If the SAFIO is to serve as a prosthesis to be worn over the foot, under the sock or hose, the trim is made at whatever point is appropriate.  The patient may need an inlay with a forefoot filler for an amputation.  In this case the trim can be much the same as for the inlay except the trim will be moved up to the edge along the top of the filler.  It helps patient comfort to leave a rim from the forefoot filler up onto the dorsum of the patient's foot.  This forms a shallow cup that totally protects the amputation area from the shoe pressure, and the creasing break point of the shoe.

<P>If the SAFIO is serving as a size accommodation or if there is a posterior heel problem such as a Boyd amputation, it may need to be a complete slipper and the trim would be just under the malleoli. A little experience will help these trim decisions.

<P>It is best to leave the trim edges too long initially as they can always be shortened after a trial fitting.

<CENTER>
<H2>Adjustments and Modifications</H2></CENTER>
It will be necessary to make some adjustments from time to time. If for instance you need more room at the toe of a slipper-type prosthesis, it can be turned wrong side out and trimmed with scissors or sanded on a belt sander with a sharp new paper.  Sometimes the patient may need a wider shoe; however it is possible to grind some off the bottom of a SAFIO to gain width in a shoe.  Remember 1/8" of insole thickness equals one full width in a shoe.

<P>Adjustments can be made to increase or decrease pressure in specific areas, such as individual metatarsal heads.  To relieve under a metatarsal head simply put your finger inside the SAFIO and push out the area under the met head.  Then thin it on belt sander while you hold it out.  It is usually beneficial to incorporate a metatarsal pad behind these areas as well.  To do so clean the area well, rough it with sand paper, choose the pad to be mounted and sand it too.  Then use a contact neoprene cement such as Barge or Masters and apply to both pieces, let cure until tacky, and then press together. This makes a permanent bond.

<P><B>5. FUNCTIONAL ORTHOSES.</B> The casting shell may be used to make functional orthoses for major amputations. It is traditional if the patient has had a forefoot amputation (6) to modify their shoes.  By converting the shoes to rigid rocker bottoms you can prevent the shoe from folding back on the foot. The rocker also aids the patient in ambulation.  When making a SAFIO, the bottom of it can be laid up in the casting shell base out of fiberglass. This gives the rigidity needed to prevent the shoe from folding back and it also becomes a spring that stores energy from the gait cycle to aid in toe off. If the amputation has been rather extensive such as a chopart, lisfranc, or transmetatarsal, a filler block of flexible foam should be formed.  It can be made of urethane or silicone foam and can be formed in the casting shell right on the fiberglass base plate so that it adheres to it and fits properly.  It should not extend closer than 1/2" to the anterior end of the foot. This remaining space is filled with accommodative visco elastic polymer. This saves considerable weight, eliminates the need for a high rigid rocker and improves function.  The rest of this construction would be much the same as number four above.

<P><B>6. CUSTOM BASES.</B> There will still be patients who will be so far out of the range of normal shoe size that custom shoes and sandals will have to be made for them. Casting shells can be selected slightly oversize and used to make custom bases for the shoes and sandals that are to be made for these patient's.  The process would be as outlined in number three above.

<CENTER>
<H2>Patient Education</H2></CENTER>
Patient education is an important part of any rehabilitation program.  Proper hygiene is of prime importance.  Patients are instructed to carefully wash their feet and inspect them thoroughly every day.  The skin can usually benefit from a good massage using an approved liniment or balm such as Ampu Balm (7).  If there are any minor skin irritations, Amp Aid Ointment (7) is highly recommended by wearers of prostheses.  Any irritation that persists should be brought to the attention of the patient's doctor or dermatologist if no obvious cause can be found.

<P>Instruct the patient to remove the SAFIO from the foot or shoe daily and clean it with mild hand soap and water, towel it dry, then powder it freely.  Ampu Talc Amputee Powder (7) is highly recommended for this.  It gives a smooth odorless film, and is non medicated.

<P>Instruct the patient to keep their shoes in good repair. This helps with their comfort, balance, and longevity of their shoes and SAFIO's. It is good practice to make a follow-up appointment for a check-up approximately one week after dispensing the shoes and SAFIO. This is particularly true if the patient has neuropathic feet.

<CENTER>
<H2>Additional Comments</H2></CENTER>
The SAFIO process allows the patient's foot to be fully visible while the orthosis is being constructed around it. With new Transparent Gold PQ (8) all of the insoling and postings can be made transparent. The Casting Shells are transparent as well as the PQ liquid polymer. A transparent section can be made in the casting platform with a reflecting mirror below it.  With this setup the orthotic technician can view the total process in progress.  Where there are areas of pressure greater than the patient's blood pressure, the skin becomes blanched.  These blanched areas show up as white blotches and are highly visible. The goal of the technician of course is to distribute the patient's weight bearing over as wide an area as possible, to eliminate these blanched areas which cause ischemia.

<P>There has been considerable discussion in the orthotic industry regarding the weight of Visco Elastic Polymer.  It helps to keep in mind  the weight of total contact plaster walking casts.  Until 1985 they were the most effective proven method to close a plantar ulcer.  Visco weighs about the same as human tissue.  In the older population it is quite often the loss of protective fatty tissue at the balls of their feet that leads to metatarsal problems.  

<P>Since Riecken's Orthotic Laboratories introduced the process of making total contact custom inlays of liquid PQ in 1985, the unrivaled success of visco speaks for itself. There are literally thousands in use and reports have been extremely gratifying. There are reports on file of patients with open ulcers who are treated for up to five years with a variety of recommended methods without success.  Then in a few months they become ulcer free when put on total contact custom inlays of visco elastic polymer.

<CENTER>
<H2>Precedents for the Concept</H2></CENTER>
Synthetic rubber foot prostheses have been in use for quite some time.  They differ in that they are generally made to resemble a foot shape instead of the shoe shape.  Mr. Horst Buckner, of Life Like Laboratory of Dallas, Texas makes foot prostheses sculpted and painted to match the uninjured foot in every detail.  They are beautiful functional works of art, and of course very expensive.  

<P>The Bauerfiend Company of Germany introduced a ready-made visco heel cup a few years ago. It has no restricting cover. The patient is walking on pure visco and it functions extremely well. It is one of the best in the industry.

<P>Distal End Pads for legs amputations have been made of pure visco for several years, including suction types that hold the artificial limb on.  Carl Casper, a C.P.O. of Northwestern Limb and Brace of St. Cloud, Minnesota who is himself an amputee has worn a custom molded pure PQ distal end pad for two years. He has made them for more than 50 of his patients.  He reports the comfort achieved is unsurpassed.

<H2>Conclusion</H2></CENTER>
The SAFIO is a natural transition in the evolution of foot orthoses technology.

<P><B>Claims</B>
<UL>1. The SAFIO process produces orthoses that represent an advance over the present conventional methods in use. They are molded to fit the foot and the footwear in which they are to be used.</UL>

<UL>2. The SAFIO process eliminates the need to take negative foot impressions and make foot replicas to mold orthoses.  As a result time and materials are saved. This is an economic advantage.</UL>

<UL>3. The SAFIO process reduces the need for custom-made footwear. This results in financial savings and a wider selection of more fashionable footwear.</UL>

<UL>4. A SAFIO is more comfortable than a conventionally-made orthosis because it is more accommodative and does a superior job of absorbing and dissipating the forces of shock and shear.</UL>

<UL>5. A SAFIO can reduce the need for patients to buy mis-mated footwear.  This results in savings and a more pleasing appearance.</UL>

<I>A theory by Carl Riecken, C.Ped</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=-.5>&#174;</FONT SIZE> August 1988, Carl Riecken
</CENTER>
<HR>
The healing process of superficial plantar ulcerations can be assisted by relieving ischemia caused by shoe pressure.
<P>
It seems reasonable to believe that if an area has become ischemic because pressure has been concentrated upon it, forcing the blood flow out into surrounding tissue, that it can be returned by reversing the areas of relative pressure.
<P>
This theory is based upon the premise that the ischemic area is localized and has been caused or aggravated by shoe pressure, that corrective pressure is to be alternating and not constant, that circulation is promoted by walking, and that the involved circulatory systems have not been irreversibly damaged. In this case we are going to remove or reduce pressure on the affected area, the area of ischemic damage, and put alternating greater pressure on the surrounding tissue.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>A Word of Caution</B></FONT SIZE>
<P>Walking on an ulcer is most certainly not recommended. Bed rest, and often hospitalization are proper treatment. However, many patients simply refuse to comply with this recommendation. These patients are usually insensitive and have no pain with walking. This leaves the physician with no alternative but to attempt treatment while the patient is ambulating.
<P>
If there is an increase in circulation in the area being treated that is greater than normal or if the temperature rises above normal, then the patent should be taken off a pressure reversing inlay and put on a total contact inlay.
<P>
When blood flow returns to normal in the area of concern, the treatment for ischemia is essentially completed and the patient should be placed on total contact inlays for proper maintenance.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Typical Problem</B></FONT SIZE>
<P>
A typical plantar lesion would be an ulcer on a diabetic patient with neuropathy, generally located at areas where the soft tissue is compressed between the shoe insole and a bony prominence such as a metatarsal head.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Common Treatment</B></FONT SIZE>
<P>
These problems are most commonly treated by means of total contact custom inlays. These inlays distribute weight bearing over as large a surface area as possible, thus eliminating the high pressure area, providing moderate success. The success rate of this treatment can be greatly improved by utilization of the compression casting techniques outlined in this paper.
<HR>
<CENTER>
<H2>Applying the Principle of this Theory
<BR>Or
<BR>Beyond Total Contact Custom Inlays</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Constructing Functional Pressure Reversing Inlays</B></FONT SIZE>
<P>
Pressure reversing inlays are similar to total contact custom inlays except they have a pressure relief area built in at the lesion site. When a plantar lesion exists from ischemic damage such as an ulcer or heavy callousing, it is possible to construct an inlay that not only spreads the pressure of weight bearing to other more tolerant areas, but additionally creates an area of lesser pressure at the ischemic site. This creates a condition that could conceivably force blood from the more tolerant areas into the ischemic area upon weight bearing. With each step the natural pressure of weight bearing would tend to force blood flow from the high pressure, more tolerant areas into the lower pressure area, creating the opposite effect of the condition that caused the ischemic condition originally.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Cast is First</B></FONT SIZE>
<P>
After a great deal of experimentation over a number of years, we have had most consistent results using the following technique which we call compression casting: for compression casting we use a wax sheet over a containment tray set in 1-1/4"-deep fine grain silica sand. A weight bearing impression is taken. (This process is described in detail in Riecken's News Letter #988, which is six pages accompanied by two pages of detailed color pictures.) The most important unique feature of this process is that the fine grain silica sand flows into areas of lesser pressure. Since the sand is contained in a box with a solid bottom and the wax sheet containment trays are of stainless steel, the only places the sand can flow are to the areas of lesser pressure. This flow takes place under the wax sheet which is next to the foot. The flowing continues until uniform pressure is reached. When uniform pressure is achieved, the plantar soft tissue is compressed against the skeletal structure so the body's weight is distributed uniformly to this structure.
<P>
The positive foot forms which result from filling these negative wax impressions with plaster or Liquid Last are ideal for making total contact or pressure reversing custom inlays. These foot forms are so perfect in detail you can see the skin whorls and even veins. The compression of soft tissue is such that in some forms you can actually see the outline of the skeletal structure. On forms of feet with deep soft tissue there will be surprising depth to the concave areas. Sometimes concave areas will extend from behind the metatarsal heads all the way into the base of the heel. The soft tissue had to be compressed this much before it would bear its uniform share of the total loading.
<P> 
After the foot forms are made using the compression casting technique discussed previously, the area of ischemic damage is located on the foot form. Then prepare a patch of firm material one-eighth of an inch thick (firm felt or side leather works well) that is at least three-eighths of an inch larger than the lesion all the way around the edge. This three-eighths of an inch edge border is then skived or sanded to a zero thickness at the edge. This patch is then cemented onto the foot form over the damaged site. The foot form prepared in this manner is now ready for a vacuum-formed inlay cover. Whenever there is an open lesion, we choose one-eighth-inch pink plastazote for the inlay cover, as it has proven to be the most accommodative. We then proceed into every irregularity of the foot form's shape. To view this process in detail, see Riecken's Video Tape titled <A HREF="modern.html"><CITE>The Modern Orthotic Lab</CITE>.</A>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Pressure Reversing Inlay</B></FONT SIZE>
<P>
The inlay that results from this process will support the foot uniformly except at the lesion site, where the patch was placed upon the foot form; the patch forms a relief area. The results of this simple modification can be dramatic in restoring circulation to the problem area.
<P>
In the last paragraph of the discussion on casting, I made mention of concave areas in the foot forms that result from the compression of soft tissue in the casting. These areas on the foot forms result in convex areas on the finished inlays. When the patient is fitted into shoes with these inlays, these convex areas will cause the same compression of soft tissue on the plantar surface as the wax casting did. The shoes should have enough room in them so that the compression only takes place upon weight bearing. When the foot is relaxed as when sitting or when not at midstance of the gait cycle, there should be no compression of soft tissue. This sets up a cycle of compression and decompression of tissue around the lesion site upon walking. This can be compared to a pumping action. The circulation systems of these areas being alternately compressed and decompressed will fill with blood and then be expelled of it upon weight bearing. Theoretically the lesion site would become the area of least resistance for the blood to flow into.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Choosing and Modifying Therapeutic Footwear</B></FONT SIZE>
<P>
For the pressure reversing inlays to function properly, footwear is very important and can offer additional therapy. The footwear must be deep enough to accommodate the foot and the inlay without being tight. At the ball fit with the patient standing there should be enough slack to roll a wrinkle, but not enough to pinch up. The last of the shoe must match the patient's foot shape. The inlay must fit into the shoe without distortion. The heels should be snug to prevent slippage. The heel counters should be firm enough to prevent rotation of the calcaneous. The soles should be of a crepe wedge construction, as this gives positive shank support and is a light-weight construction. Remember, the inlays are flexible, so they must have positive support. It is sometimes necessary to grind the bottoms of the inlays to fit the insole contours of the shoe so that the inlay can lay on the insole without any distortion from the insole contours.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Common Footwear Modifications</B></FONT SIZE>
<P>
Common modifications that can improve the function of footwear are as follows: When the plantar lesion is in the forefoot area, rocker bottom soles are beneficial. They shorten the time spent on and reduce the impact forces on the forefoot. When the problem is in the heel or hindfoot, it helps to grind some heel spring into the heels or to install a layer of soft sach rubber under the heel lift to lessen heel strike shock and slow the loading. When the lesion is in the midfoot area where there is an extremely prominent bony protrusion such as in the case with a Charcot foot (in the area of the scaphoid), locate this area on the insole of the shoe and then with a hole saw cut out this area the same size as the original patch as was placed upon the foot form to make the inlay relief area. Cut all the way through the insole filler and outsole. Then put a thin outsole on the bottom of the shoe to form a bottom for this hole. Next take a rasp and round and smooth the edges of this hole in the insole. Now mix up a small quantity of liquid "PQ" and make it a soft durometer mix, and pour it into this hole until the hole is filled to slightly overflowing onto the insole. This mixture adheres to the insole material very firmly and makes a pocket under the inlay that will not bottom out and put pressure on the lesion area. The shoe modifications possible are limited only by your imagination. In the hands of a good Pedorthist, a shoe can definitely become a therapeutic device.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Patient Intructions</B></FONT SIZE>
<P>
The patient must be instructed to NEVER JUST STAND. Standing without movement can cause blanching on the entire weight bearing surface area. The patient must be instructed to shift from foot to foot, lifting each foot entirely off the surface when standing in a confined area. It is a good practice for the patient to make a conscious effort to contract the calf muscles with each step, as this contraction on the circulatory system aids circulation. The patient must be encouraged to get plenty of rest. The patient must, of course, be supplied with a complete diabetic information education package.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Summary</B></FONT SIZE>
<P>
We have applied the pedorthic principles discussed in this paper with considerable success in our facility here in Evansville, Indiana. We work with private patients on a prescription basis form local doctors. We have not the testing equipment or the funding to approach these ideas on a scientific basis to extract a yield of quantitative data which would be necessary to prove the theory expounded in this paper. The paper is presented in the hope that some facility such as a university hospital or a public health facility might possibly see the value of these ideas and pursue them in a research project.

<H1>The Old Shoe Game and a Game It Is</H1>     
<BR><FONT SIZE=+2><I>An Essay on Selling Shoes Retail for Fun and Profit</I></FONT SIZE>
<P>by Carl Riecken
</CENTER>
<HR>
The old shoe game, and a game it is (that is important to remember right from the start), can be very challenging, very rewarding and a lot of fun if approached with the right set of good basic game rules.
<P>
<B>Rule Number One--The customer.</B> 
<BR>The customer is <I>not</I> always right, but you must always let him believe he is. If you can teach something, but make him think he thought of it himself, chalk up 10 points. In fact, to make him think he taught you something is worth 15 points. At the same time, however, he must respect your experience and knowledge or you lose 22 points.
<P>
<B>Rule Number Two--The size game.</B> 
<BR>A customer always knows the best size shoe for himself, but as a rule will not volunteer this information. He wants you to tell him--to see if you are right. He wants a snap answer from you, even though it may have taken him 15 years to determine this for himself. This makes for a very interesting and challenging game by itself. The best approach to this is to make a game of the answer. 
<P>Immediately after you measure his feel (and please always measure both feet, if only to impress him with your thoroughness) he will ask you what size he wears. At this point the stock answer must be, "I don't know yet, you are in between sizes and we are going to have to try on some shoes." (This is what you really want to do anyway--you can't score until you do.) If you would be so unguarded as to tell him a size you think he might wear, he would immediately score his first "I Gotcha", which is 22 points in his favor. Just three points short of a lost sale.
<P>
In playing the size game with your customer, always keep in mind the great amount of help provided for you by the giants of the shoe industry. After all of the hundreds of years and thousands of dollars spent on experimentation and research, this game of selecting a shoe size has been reduced to a form of science. First, to keep it simple, most common measuring devices are made to size men's, women's and children's shoes <I>on the same scale</I>. It wouldn't make sense to have three different devices lying around. 
<P>However, you must keep in mind a few breakdowns that have not been provided for--for instance a size 12 1/2 misses shoe is usually smaller than a size 12 child's. A misses size three is quite often considerably larger than a lady's size 4 1/2, and of course you can bury a lady's size 8 flat inside most men's size 8. The fact that you use one perfectly calibrated scientific measuring device to measure all feet to fit into these scientifically designed men's, women's and children's shoes is one of the challenging and interesting things you have to learn about this business. For the system to be refined any further would mean that anyone could do it, your job would be endangered and it would become a boring drag anyway! 
<P>
<B>Rule Number Three--Get a shoe.</B>
<P>After playing the size game, get a shoe on the customer's foot. It's like a foot in the door if you are going to make a sale. If you can do this, score yourself 15 points. You are on your way to becoming a winner.

<HR>
<CENTER>
<H2>Extra Point Pointers</H2>
</CENTER>
<UL>
<B>1.</B> Show your depth of knowledge. When a customer says they want some shoes for work, your first question is, "What type of work do you do?" Then select some appropriate shoes.</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<B>2.</B> After you know the type of shoe and the size you need for your customer, you head to the stock room and find one pair that meets the requirements. The natural thing to do is to come out with it and say, "I only have this one pair." DON'T EVER SAY I HAVE ONLY ONE PAIR. Say "I have a pair you will really like," or "this is a pair you could really enjoy," or "boy, do I have a great shoe for you." NEVER, NEVER, NEVER say, "This is all I have in your size." This could be the total 25 point difference right off the bat.</UL>
<P>     
<UL>
<B>3.</B> When handling the shoes for your customer, hold the shoe as if it were a valuable and attractive product. Hold it out for the customer to see at the angle which shows its best profile. If you admire it, and you have done a convincing job with your prospect to the point that he too respects your experience and knowledge, he will almost have to agree with your judgement on this shoe.</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<B>4.</B> When you have tried a shoe on and determined that it isn't right, then unlace it and place it back into the box as if it were a precious and respected product. Do this while your customer is waiting and watching--it will help your score by further convincing him how great your product is when you treat it with the respect it is due.</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<CENTER>
<H2>Fine Points on Fitting--Learn to Recognize Foot Shapes</H2>
</CENTER>
When measuring, look closely at the foot shape. Remember--your measuring device measures flat distances, but the feet are rounded objects. Consequently you must make allowances for the various thicknesses.
<P>
If a foot is obviously fat and thick, allow two or three widths more than your measuring device says.
<P>If a foot looks weak and flexible, better allow one or two sizes extra in length for expansion.
<P>
Always remember the last of a shoe gets wider as it gets longer--even in the same widths. This is necessary in order for the shape to remain symmetrical. In other words, a 10 B would be wider by about a half width than a 9 B. By studying this fact, you can make some difficult fits easier.
<HR>
<P>
<B>Rule Number Four--Points of a good fit.</B>
<BR>Most every customer you approach already knows what constitutes a good fit, but he wants to hear it from you, to see if you know. So after you get the shoe on his foot and are satisfied it is the best you can do, you automatically tell him the things he wants to hear:
<UL><LI>This shoe looks real good on you.
<BR><LI>The wide part of your foot is in the wide part of the shoe.
<BR><LI>Your arch is lined up with the steel shank properly.
<BR><LI>The heel is good and snug.
<BR><LI>The lacing at the vamp is uniform (if lacing is too close together at the top, the shoe could be too long, and conversely, if the shoe laces are far apart at the top the shoe could be too short).
<BR><LI>You have enough slack across the ball of the foot that I can run my thumb across it and roll a little wrinkle, but not enough to pinch up between my fingers. Just perfect.
<BR><LI>The toe length is good--you have about a thumb's length at the end.
</UL>
<P>
This is usually music to their ears, except, believe it or not, a lot more men than women want their toes right at the end of the shoe--too short really, but a point that sometimes has to be compromised to prevent losing 25 points, which is the whole game. You do what you have to do to win within reason, of course. You can sell an adult any size he or she wants, but never compromise on a child. Too big is as bad as too small--they both cause trouble. But if a customer insists on taking a size you know will not be comfortable, be sure and note on the invoice and on the record card that the customer did not take the size you recommended and is responsible for the fit themselves.
<P>Another statement you must make to the customer because they want to hear it--and should you forget it could cost you the game--is, "Look how nice it fits up into your arch." This is usually the clincher, and after this series of declarations on your part, you get to ask a few direct questions, like, "They really do feel good, don't they." As soon as you get a positive response to this type of question, <I>you immediately go deaf.</I> Ask your customer to please repeat his answer of "They feel very nice!" On hard ones you may have to hear it again if you can convincingly feign deafness one more time--because at this point the customer is selling himself. This is worth 23 points in anyone's game.
<P> 
<B>Rule Number Five--Scoring.</B>
<BR>To win you have to score the full 25 points. To go all the way when you are this close can be a little tricky. You must keep in mind at all times that the customer does not want to be sold anything. He wants to decide for himself, so at all costs you must avoid some questions, such as, "Do you want to buy them today?" These are game points and must be finessed.
<P>
A statement like, "They do go nicely with the outfit you have on--would you like to wear them today?" will help you score. Or if there is a choice between two pair, the easiest and obvious thing to do is to suggest that while you have their size, it might be a good idea to have both pair. This could be worth 50 points if approached right! A double bingo!
<P>
An old standby, after all of the formalities have been completed, is to simply assume a purchase and ask, "Would you like to wear them or do you want to save them for good for awhile?" These game points are a little tricky. Imagination and learning your customer by paying close attention to his responses up to this point are very important. Always assume that the customer came to buy--you will have lots of lookers, but they can be made into buyers and this is part of the challenge of the game--to turn a looker into a buyer is a straight 25 points. A full-time player with today's prices can win big if he can score an average of 500 points a day.
<P>
<P>
<CENTER>
<H2>Bonus Points</H2>
</CENTER>
You can make a customer your call customer. (These are money in the bank types.) If you can do a little bit of customizing with each pair that a customer buys--when only you know their fitting problems and the solutions--you've got him locked up.
<P>
One word that must be ruled out of this game to score is the word <I>jimmy</I>. You never jimmy up a customer's shoe to make it fit. You might do a little customizing for them--sometimes even at no extra charge. For instance, let's say a person has a foot that needs more width at the ball than is standard, but when you accommodate this ball width the heel gets too loose. You have a chance to customize. Now whatever you do in this case, DON'T and I repeat DON'T go for the heel grippers. The guy who invented these should have the Bluebird of Happiness build a nest in his nose. They are terrible and they are so common. Anyone can buy the at a five and dime. They push the foot forward into the toe, leave an ugly space at the back of the shoe where they glare at you. They never stay in place--they roll down when you put your foot in or they stick great to your socks. They are No No's. You must keep these in stock to sell, but never use them. Messing up a good shoe with those things is strictly a do-it-yourself job.
<P>
To customize this shoe, instead of heel grippers, you take a little depth out of the shoe by means of a half cork insole under the sockliner or by a tongue in vamp. This keeps the foot from going forward and tightens the heel. Of course, you do this in the back room and spend enough time there to let the customer know you are really working for him, but not enough for him to get impatient.
<P>
<CENTER>
<H2>The Coup De Grace</H2>
</CENTER>
When you have the right shoe but it is just a little stiff and bites around the heel, take them back into the shop and work them over with your roll ease. This smooths seams and counters. In two minutes you can do more to break in the shoe than the foot will do in two weeks. Tell the customer you are going to soften them up special for them, and these will really do it. Also, flex the soles several times while you have them in the back. This will do more to stop heels slipping than any single thing. When the customer already likes the shoes and you furnish this treatment, you can register 25 points, and bet on a call back the next time your customer needs shoes.
<CENTER>
<H2>Real No No's and Don't Venture into Never Never Land</H2>
</CENTER>
DON'T PLAY DOCTOR! This can cost you total points in the long run. You can build a good loyal following by studying the art of filling prescriptions--if you have the proper type of footwear. But never play Doctor. Advise persons with a special painful problem to see their family doctor. He can recommend a solution, or he will recommend to them a specialist that he works with. Then you can fill their prescription for them. If it does the job--fine! If it doesn't, they can go back to him and he can recommend a change that you can also fill and charge for again. By playing doctor you only end up doing your work over and over and not getting paid for any of it. And you could even end up with a malpractice suit against you. Don't even give your opinion of how the doctor's prescription is working. That is out of your area of expertise. You are a fitter and a sales person. Be the best at <I>your</I> job and stay in it and you will be a winner.
<P>
<P>
<B>Rule Number Six--No empty hands.</B>
<BR>Only a loser comes out of the stockroom empty handed.
<BR>So you have an idea what your customer is interested in--either he has told you or you formed your own idea. Now you have dashed into the stockroom only to find you don't have anything close to his size in what you went in for. So, you are disappointed, but don't blow this opportunity. Pick out any four or five pair that you do have in the right size range. The key word being <I>range</I>, because you don't really know the size until you try on the shoes, right? Sit your customer down and tell him how lucky he is you have several he can try on, and proceed with the show just as if that was the plan from the start. This is worth 24 points. <I>More scores are made this way than any other.</I>
<P>
<B>Rule Number Seven--Make the sale stick, or Cowboys and Cowpods.</B>
<BR>The old cowboys used to have a game they called "Throwing the Bull." They would throw cowpods at the barn. It wasn't hitting the barn that mattered, it was the one who made the most stick that won this game.
<P>The shoe game is much the same. Some days you turn the pressure up a little too much if you are not careful and put out a few shoes that are not quite right for your customers. You sold them, but not thoroughly enough. <P>The next day or the next week they come trotting back with them and want a refund. Now we see if you are a winner or not! You smiled when you sold them and they went out--now if you are going to succeed in this game you are going to have to smile while you graciously shell out hard earned commissions. If you do it right you can make a friend, as well as a good customer out of this situation. If you can convert a return into another sale and a happy customer without any pressure--just fixing him up with what he really should have (he doesn't always know what he should have) you can subtract 25 points, then add 40--because you are more than half way to the next score. Otherwise you just lost 25 points, but grin and be gracious. This can still result in the goodwill to anther score. Otherwise, it will cost you the game eventually--they do talk!
<P>
<B>Rule Number Eight--Play the game fair.</B>
<BR>Be fair with your fellow players, or do unto others as you would have them do unto you. When points mean commissions, some players get grabby. Fair play with call customers, returns, exchanges and refunds is very important to harmony on the playing field.
<P> 
<B>Rule Number Nine--A bird in the hand.</B>
<BR>That's 25 points. Special orders and prepay. They come with the cash, <I>so get married now.</I>
<P>
When a customer comes in the door looking for a particular shoe, they usually have the cash hot in hand. Now--if at all possible, the simplest and best is to sell something you have in stock. Special orders are always a problem and selling what you have is the rule. Some players are so anxious to please before even suggesting an alternate that is in stock, they jump into special ordering and searching the catalogs to try to find something to please the customer. First of all, this costs time and time is money. When you do write a special order, there will often be a delay, which makes your customer uneasy.
<P>
Don't get involved in specials unless there is no other way--but when you do, remember, they came with the cash. They have it now, so when you want to write the order just figure the total amount with tax and ask for payment. YES, prepayment. It is store policy on all special orders. Yes we guarantee the fit and full satisfaction and don't, as a rule, charge any extra for this service. We even absorb some extra cost, such as single pair charges and parcel post and insurance. But, no special unless prepaid. 
<P>This does a lot of things in your favor. First of all lots of customers will let you write an order for them and then go right on shopping. When you have his money he is going to wait for you. If you didn't have his money and he found something else he would buy somewhere else and be too embarrassed to call you and tell you to cancel the order. Then when the shoes come in he is notified and lots of times you will never see this customer again. Even when this pair is worn out, he can't face you once he has you stuck. So, you have not only lost this sale, but future sales as well. Therefore, your bird in the hand must be plucked for 25 points at the time he has it in his hand. At this point you are married up for better or worse, until the happy ending, which may take twice as long as you originally estimated. Never promise less than 10 days to two weeks for the order to arrive.
<P>
<B>Rule Number 10--Old stock to you, but new to who?</B>
<BR>Just about everyone. Sell the old first if you are planning on sticking around the playing field awhile. Don't be an amateur! You can always tell an amateur player because he always shows the newest stock first. Why? Because he lives with it day after day. He gets tired of the same old thing and is always happy to see the new styles arrive. This can lead to a bad case of long moss, then closed doors.
<P> 
So down to the facts...who looks at shoes more than you--even on your day off? If you don't watch yourself you start judging people by their shoes. You look at shoes first. Remember, only shoe game players do this. So you've seen all the styles and know what is new. Your customer, as a rule, couldn't look at your displays (if they are kept fresh) and tell you this year's from last year's or even the year before. Even customers who have been in your store three or four times in the past year couldn't. So the rule is, show the oldest first always and present it like it is fresh as a daisy. Use your newest, latest and greatest as sale savers. Show them last.
<P>
If you play the game this way you'll wind up a winner and so will your store. Any other way, and you help the moss to gather and grow form the back of the room to the fitting stool. When the front doors no longer open your game will be over.
<P>
<B>Rule Number Eleven--Game Rules on Prices and Mr. Arch Fart.</B>
<BR>If you apologize for your price subtract 24 points! How do you value your service? If it wasn't very valuable your customer could have gone to a Pick-a-Pair for a do-it-yourself job.
<P>
Shoe values are very relative. Some customers will pay a hundred dollars for a sandal consisting of two gold-colored strings that curve gracefully around the foot. Those strings are really plastic, and attached to a thin sole that couldn't have cost $.25 at the manufacturing level--only, of course, if it was designed by Mr. Arch Fart of Italy. Then others may object to paying $40 for a pair of men's shoes that have three square feet of the finest calfskin for uppers and two feet of prime steer hide for soles, as well as the combined work and effort of over 50 shoemaking operations, all performed by separate experts--as well as your services.
<P>
If anything your services are the most important part of the total price. Just consider, you're going to be fitting those shoes to the individual foot, and guarantee that they will be comfortable. This is personal service at the highest level and truly priceless. So when a customer asks how much, you never, never have to hang your head and apologize. Instead you look him square in the eye and reply--only x dollars, and that includes custom fitting! A bargain at any price.
<P>
<B>Rule Number Twelve: The Player's Game Tools.</B>
<BR>In any game you have to have rules and tools. In poker your tools are your cards and chips. In the shoe game your tools are your display shoes. By now, you know how to score. Now, consider your tools. The sharper your tools, the easier it is to score. Displays and display shoes are every player's responsibility. They must be treated with great respect and kept sharp at all times or they will cost you points. Points, sales and commissions which is really what we play for. When you consider  dull tools and tools not properly displayed in an appealing and orderly way, you better believe this directly affects your pocketbook. It is going to cost you money. Then, it pays to spend every spare minute sharpening your tools. After all, we are playing for keeps, not funsies.
<P>
<B>Rule Number Thirteen--Care of the Playing Field.</B>
<BR>All players must cooperate in keeping the stock orderly. You can't keep score if you can't find the shoe you want! A shoe box out of place is a shoe box lost. It costs you points and commissions. It costs the store money, because the next time that stock number is inventoried and ordered, that shoe, because it is out of place, will be reordered and replaced. The one that is lost will start to grow moss and you know what that can lead to, so for your sake as well as the store's, take some spare time and cooperate in straightening and reorganizing stock. It is every player's responsibility to help in this. Of course, it goes without saying that each player is responsible for returning to stock each pair that he has had out for a try on. And at the same time when doing this, be sure the shoes are unlaced and properly tissued so the next time they are brought out, they look as fresh as the first time.
<P>
<B>Rule Number Fourteen--Improve Your Game for Extra Points.</B>
<BR>Look for the store's advertisements and be on the lookout for what is being advertised, because that is where the action is. You can't win if you don't know the score. Try to keep ahead and study the features of shoes to be advertised so you are ready for action. Know where this stock is located, the colors and sizes available. It's the players who study the game that are going to end up the big winners. There will always be some players who are consistently high scorers. Study their technique and find out why. They will share their secrets if you will just ask, but they may not know themselves why, so to study them is to improve your game.
<P>
<B>Rule Number Fifteen--Mini Points or Small Scores that Add Up to Big Bucks.</B>
<BR>Get paid twice, and enjoy being the expert! The professionals (the consistent winners) know that mini points can pay the rent. Some call them bonus points, and they are yours for the suggesting. For suggesting polish and shoe care products, laces, sox and hose. These small items add up fast. Let's just suppose that with each pair of shoes you suggest to the customer that since he is buying such as nice shoe, he buy the proper polish or conditioner to keep them nice, extend their life and make them stay soft and comfortable.
<P>
Polishes range in price from $.59 to $2.25. It is easy to score on 50 percent of all sales and with practice, 75 percent. To average $50 to $75 per week in gross sales should be very easy if proper attention is focused on this. Your nine or 10 percent commission is going to mean $5 to $7 extra in your pocket. At 4.3 weeks per month, this means a minimum of $20 per month extra commission.
<P>
Now for the getting paid twice--this is the nice part. The manufacturers of most of the better lines of polish and shoe care items want you to sell them badly enough to pay you also. Most brands will have items with a PM tab that is worth from $.20 to $.50 per item sale. These tabs you pull off at the time of sale and send in to the manufacturer. They will send you a check that will be tax free money because you are not going to report it, and the PM money can be equal to or greater than your commission. So the little extra points can total $40 to $50 real cash each and every month if you make a real conscious effort and suggest them with every sale. Your customer appreciates your additional interest.
<P>
<B>Rule Number Sixteen--Automatic Points.</B>
<BR>Build your call trade by keeping your records. So, you have a new customer. It is a difficult fitting and you earn your sale by doing all of the things necessary to accomplish it. In so doing you have displayed your knowledge and convinced the customer you know your stuff. Now play your trump card. You say to him, "Now that I am familiar with your fitting problem, I would like to make a permanent record card on you so that we will know in the future your size and width and the type of shoe that works best for you. Then the next time you come in we know just what to do." This makes the customer feel important, it makes you important to him and the next time he needs shoes you can be sure he will look you up if you have done your job right. And the next time will be fast and easy if you pull the card before you start and see just what you did before. These call customers eventually just call you up and ask you to send them anther pair. This is like clipping coupons or having an annuity. After five or six years if you develop this call trade properly, your job will become easier and more profitable. You'll score higher with less effort.
<P> 
Of course, the same is true of growing children and the record card. It ties you together. You keep track of their progress and the parents learn to respect your judgement. You will have the pleasure of seeing those little ones grow up and <I>pay you</I> every time they need a pair of shoes.
<P>
<B>Rule Number Seventeen--The Scorekeeper.</B>
<BR>The boss knows who is scoring big consistently and maybe how and why. By monitoring the invoices, the record cards, the returns, exchanges and refunds, he has a real good insight into who is doing what. If you are not getting call customers and referrals after a reasonable period, you should start asking yourself why, because something is not going right and can be improved.
<P>
<B>Rule Number Eighteen--The real pro player, or going into business for yourself without the overhead.</B>
<BR>
After you have been at the game long enough to have a file full of record cards with your name on them as the main fitter (this is the basis of your call trade), you then no longer have to depend totally upon the store to pull your business in. You will, of course, take full advantage of all of the walk ins and trade that comes from advertising specials, but you now can go after your own. 
<P>When the game is slow, go through your cards and check to see who hasn't been in for awhile, then see what they usually buy and if you have anything new in the type of footwear they generally buy. If so, give them a call or drop them a postcard. They will be pleased and flattered that you thought of them and you will score on a high percentage of these. With a little thought you can find lots of variations of this approach.
<P>
When you are really a professional player, you don't have to hide your light under a basket. You win friends, gain respect with your friends, fellow employees and the community in general. When you play fair, but play hard and play to win, you will win financially too.
<P>

<B>A note from the author:</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<I>I have tried to touch on what I consider to be the more important high points of selling shoes retail in this little essay. I hope that those of you in the trade who read this enjoy it and understand that. All through I treat the subject lightly. I sincerely feel that selling shoes is a very worthy, rewarding and honorable trade. One that some consider a profession. It certainly is an important service to the public. And I must say, one that has been very good to me and my family.
<P>
I hope this essay will at least in some small way help you to improve your game for yourself and your customer, and at the same time help you to enjoy it more.</I>

Riecken's Orthotic Laboratory: Soft Foot Orthotics
</TITLE>

Dispelling Some Faulty Logic: 
<BR>Basic Considerations of Soft Foot Orthotics</H1>
</CENTER>
<HR>
By understanding and applying these three basic considerations in constructing soft orthotics, you will achieve a high degree of success in your efforts.
<UL>
1. Proper weight distribution.
<P>2. Shock and Shear Absorption and Dissipation.
<P>3. Posting to accommodate or correct biomechanical deficiencies.
</UL>
<CENTER>
<H2>Weight Distribution</H2>
</CENTER>
It is sad to note that many learned men believe that a foot with a misaligned metatarsal head or a prominent callous can be comforted by being placed upon a cushion insole. Upon weight bearing, the cushion is compressed greatest under these prominences. The point of greatest compression is the point of greatest pressure, which is exactly the opposite of the desired result.
<P>
To relieve pressure from these prominences one must redistribute the weight bearing over as wide an area as is possible. This is most easily accomplished by using heat moldable materials such as polyethylene foams. These are marketed under a wide variety of names--the most prominent of which is Plastazote. These materials are available in a wide range of densities and should be chosen with thought to the patient's condition, weight, and the type of activity they are involved in. The softer the density, the more accommodative these materials are, but they are less durable as well. If the softer materials are needed, they may have to be replaced frequently.
<P>
Custom molded insoles do not in themselves correct any abnormal foot condition. However they can relieve high pressure areas and give relief to symptoms.
<CENTER>
<H2>Shock and Shear</H2>
</CENTER>
Feet are very delicate and complicated structures. They can be damaged easily in a wide variety of ways, the most common of which is probably overuse. Studies have shown that repetitive stress without proper rest and recuperation time is a major cause of serious foot ailments, especially among patients with insensitive feet. A great many people with otherwise normal healthy feet who work long hours on hard floors suffer from overuse as well.
<P>
Shock and shear forces play a big part in the damage caused from repetitive stress. The custom molded insoles previously discussed can be greatly enhanced by application of an underliner of shock and shear force absorbing and dissipating material, to protect the feet from these forces.
<P>
First let me dispel another common mistaken belief. Again many learned men confuse shock absorption with cushion insoling. The best example of shock absorbers is in the automobile. Without shock absorbers or with worn out ones, a car will shock and jar you to pieces on a bumpy road, even though the car has good springs. The good springs are most comparable to cushion insoles. Latex foam rubber insoles and synthetic foam rubbers such as neoprene or urethane return shock forces almost instantly with almost equal force. These foam insoles are ideal for competition athletics as they return the energy of the shock forces of impact with almost 100 percent efficiency. They truly put spring in your step. However these athletes would probably benefit from training on a more shock absorbing and dissipating material. It could decrease training injuries. They could wear the foam rubber insoles for competition events to enhance their performance. Shock absorbers are really timers--they slow the velocity just prior to impact and spread it over an extended time period. They then slow the rebound in a similar manner to reduce the aftershock.
<P>
It will help if you remember two basic things. The first is for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The second is the formula for calculating shock force. Shock Force = Mass (weight) x Velocity (speed at impact). You can readily see from this formula that slowing the velocity prior to impact can greatly reduce the shock force.
<P> 
Approximately 10 years ago, a new group of materials was developed with excellent shock and shear dissipating properties. This group of materials are visco elastic polymers. They are not of a foam cellular expanded nature, but are of a solid, more flesh-like consistency--almost in the gel family of materials. They have a very unique property in that they flow, upon impact, perpendicular to the force of impact--almost like a bag of hydraulic fluid might do. Then they return slowly to their normal shape in time for the next impact. This property makes them excellent shock absorbers. Additionally when a twisting force is applied to their surface, they respond by flowing internally in the direction of the force with next to no shearing action on the surface of the material.
<P>
Now to recap a little, when we develop a custom molded insole, then install an underliner of shock and shear force abating Visco Elastic Polymer, we are beginning the development of a very sophisticated orthosis. We have spread the weight bearing over as wide an area as is possible to relieve pressure points and accommodate deformities. Plus we are protecting the foot from destructive shock and shearing forces. At this point we have done a great deal to comfort and relieve symptoms and perhaps help prevent further deterioration, but we have done little or nothing to correct biomechanical deficiencies that are correctable or to restore more normal function to those problems that are not correctable. This is where postings are needed.
<P>
Postings are a very broad subject and can get very technical. This paper will only attempt an overview. Serious students will want to do more extensive research on this very important subject.
<P>
Postings can take many forms to accomplish a broad range of functions. They can be placed into two general categories for purpose of discussion. Postings which involve modifications of the foot form are generally considered intrinsic postings. This would include such things as making an excavation in the foot form posterior to a dropped metatarsal head. This would in turn make a positive metatarsal lift in the orthotic molded over this form. The opposite type of posting would be called extrinsic. An example of this would be to place a pad on the foot form directly over the dropped metatarsal head, perhaps an eighth of an inch thick and feathered to zero thickness around its edge. An orthotic molded over this would have a built-in relief pocket directly under the metatarsal head. Now you can readily see where you might use both of these postings together. The intrinsic posting would apply a corrective force attempting to correct the metatarsal alignment or at least prevent it from dropping further out of alignment. The extrinsic posting would relieve pressure from the head in its position.
<P>
Postings can be used by a skilled technician to manipulate the forefoot in relation to the hind-foot or mid-foot. They can be used to accommodate various varus or valgus conditions. Postings can be used to accommodate shortages such as leg length discrepancies. Even external shoe modifications can be considered a form of posting. In the hands of a skilled technician, the application of postings is practically an art form. Certainly no orthotic technician can claim proficiency without a great deal of study and practical experience.
<P>
For those interested in orthotic materials and their properties, Riecken's Orthotic Laboratory offers a free sample test kit with samples of four of the industry's leading soft orthotic materials.

<H1>10 Steps to a Good Fit</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>1. Don't select shoes by the size marked inside the shoe. Sizes vary among shoe brands and styles. Judge the shoe by how it fits on your foot.
<P>2. Select a shoe that conforms as nearly as possible to the shape of your foot.
<P>3. Have your feet measured regularly. The size of your feet changes as you grow older.
<P>4. Have both feet measured. Most people have one foot larger than the other. Fit to the largest foot.
<P>5. Fit at the end of the day when your feet are the largest.
<P>6. Stand during the fitting process and check that there is adequate space (3/8" to 1/2") for your longest toe at the end of each shoe.
<P>7. Make sure the ball of your foot fits well into the widest part (ball pocket) of the shoe.
<P>8. Don't purchase shoes that feel too tight, expecting them to "stretch" to fit.
<P>9. Your heel should fit comfortably in the shoe with a minimum amount of slippage.
<P>10. Walk in the shoe to make sure it fits and feels right.

<H1>Great New Fashion Trends You Can Wear to Work</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>Lug-soled urban boots and hiking boots are high fashion this winter. While mostly popular for casual wear-they look great with jeans and leggings-these boots are also appropriate teamed with long flowing or slinky skirts and layered top dressing. If you want to go for the hiking boot look, might as well go for the real thing, not a cheap, badly-constructed look-alike. Check out brands such as Timberland, Rockport and Dexter, companies that have been making great hiking boots for years. 
<P>The hiking-boot look has spilled over into the walking shoe/sports shoe category as well. Nike, Reebok and other athletic shoe manufacturers have introduced "rugged walking shoes" with that hiking boot look and all the comfortable inner construction of athletic shoes. Instead of tiresome white with bright colored racing stripes, you'll see rich, dark leather and fine stitching detail.
<P>Why has it taken shoe manufacturers so long to realize that city streets impose dangers no less daunting than any found on the Appalacian Trail? Whether the urban boot idea sprung from research or from clever hybriding  by designers thrashing about for a new look, it's great for feet. Take advantage of it.
<P>Rounded toebox Mary Janes with a 1-2 inch boxy heel, offer a more dressy look. Many also feature modified rubber lug soles for extra shock absorption. In patent leather, the look can actually become quite dressy. The related T-strap pump, also with a rounded, roomy toebox, is great for your feet. The strap over the top holds the shoe to the foot better than the traditional pump. 
<P>The men's shoe look popular last winter has endured into this season and will be around for some time. Wingtips or dress loafers look wonderful with tailored women's trousers. Since men's shoes are traditionally shaped like real feet, these shoes are generally roomy enough to be comfortable and offer good heel stability. If the soles and insoles provide good shock absorption, you have a great shoe to get you through the day. Other, quite feminine tie shoes have become dressy this winter. The styles are classic, the materials rich and elegant-deep-toned, high-quality leathers and suedes.

<H1>Bunions and Ill-Fitting Shoes</H1>
<I>by Lowell Scott Weil, DPM</I>
</CENTER>

<P>Bunions are a painful deformity of the big toe at the juncture where it meets the middle part of the foot. We've all seen them, a bulging, generally reddish knob sometimes as large as a golf ball. If your bunions become serious and are not treated, you'll experience some level of discomfort or pain every time you place your foot inside a shoe.
<P>The leading cause of bunions is ill-fitting shoes. Your shoe's stylistic curvature tends to push the big toe toward the lesser toes. For individuals with a hereditary disposition, bunions will result. For example, people with a long great toe have a greater chance of developing bunions than those with a shorter toe. Bunions are irreversible. Indeed, they often get worse over time, especially if you continue wearing ill-fitting shoes. 
<P>Your main treatment is to find shoes that are shaped to accommodate the deformity. If that doesn't help, than surgical correction may be required. 
<P>Walking in the jungles of Papua, New Guinea, where natives go barefoot, I saw no bunions at all. Two years ago, I lectured in India where people go either shoeless or walk in sandals. I spoke about bunion surgery. The main question doctors asked was, "What's a bunion?"

<I>Lowell Scott Weil, DPM, is a past president of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons, and Team Podiatrist to the Chicago Bears and Chicago White Sox.</I>

<HEAD><TITLE>Stride Vol 1 No. 1 Premiere Issue (February 1996) The APMA Seal</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF TEXT=#000000>

<BR>Premiere Issue, Volume 1 Number 1

<CENTER>
<H1>The APMA Seal of Acceptance</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>Currently, there are no commercially independent "standards" for what defines a comfort shoe. The closest thing to a guiding light is the long-established American Podiatric Medical Association's Seal of Acceptance. 
<P>The APMA Seal came into existence because so many patients were constantly asking their podiatrist, "What shoe would you recommend?" You may have seen the Seal on shoe boxes or in advertisements. What does it mean? How does a shoe get the Seal?
<P>Here's how it works. Specific products are submitted to the APMA Medical Officer for prescreening. The application poses numerous questions and requires documentation for claims. After all questions are answered to the APMA Medical Officer's satisfaction, copies of the product are submitted to a committee of seven leading podiatrists. No scientific or quantitative testing is undertaken because, as an APMA source indicates, "We are not a testing lab." But the shoes must pass a hands-on assessment by podiatrists who cut the shoes apart to examine materials, seams, insoles and other comfort components according to the podiatrists' professional standards based on years of treating feet. If the shoes pass the physical assessment, they are wear tested by the doctors, or friends or patients of the doctors, for anecdotal acceptance. The seven doctors then make a consensus decision which creates a ballot recommendation. That ballot recommendation is then sent to the APMA Board of Trustees for final decision. 
<P>The Seal is a coveted one in the shoe industry. And not all who apply are accepted. Stride has learned that one of the most powerful shoe concerns in America had some of its shoes rejected. The well-known firm sought approval for more than a half dozen shoes, but only three were approved. That company is still trying to revise the design to gain acceptance for the other three. 
<P>As the comfort revolution proliferates, more shoe manufactures are aggressively seeking official podiatric endorsement. While the APMA Seal does not automatically guarantee that the shoe will be right for you, it at least helps guide your choices.
<P>The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society is also developing a Seal, this one to combine both testing and observational aspects. The AOFAS seal, still evolving, is scheduled to appear in the coming months.

<H1>Where to Stay</H1>
</CENTER>

<H2>Jerusalem</H2>  
<B>King David.</B> Arguably the most stately hotel 
in Israel and certainly the hotel with the most character. Loaded with foreign dignitaries 
and veteran visitors to Israel. Coffee or tea on the patio is an event. Centrally located for everything.
<P><B>Hyatt Regency.</B> Located on Mt. Scopus with panoramic views of the city, the Hyatt may have Jerusalem's most inviting pool. Wonderful grounds ideal for moonlight walking. A favorite with tour groups and even Israelis from other cities. Exquisite and expensive art galleries.
<H3>Tel Aviv</H3>
<B>Hilton.</B> Tel Aviv's top hotel, say many. Fantastic beachfront and pool area. Frequented by international businessmen, airline pilots and film stars. Exquisite restaurants. The lobby to be for coffee and pastries.
<H3>Dead Sea</H3> 
<B>Nirvana.</B> The best of the Dead Sea health spas has an elegant sports club, sumptuous buffets, and a wonderful beach on the Dead Sea where everything floats due to the high salt content. Mineral mud baths. Jeep and hiking tours organized. Near Masada.
<H3>Eilat</H3>
<B>Princess.</B> Israel's most lavish hotel is built into the side of a massive rock, with towering glass walls to bring the lobby dining halls into the mountain itself. Great restaurants, lobby music and entertainment. World class spa and sports club. Extraordinary multi-level swimming pool complex. Just a 15-minute walk from the Egyptian border crossing at Taba. 
<H3>Best restaurant</H3>
<B>Mama Mia</B> in Jerusalem. It's so hard to find, having its address is worthless. Just try to find a taxi driver who really knows the location. The pastas and Israeli-style appetizers are mouth watering. The ambience is an unforgettable garden in an old Turkish style mansion. You may find yourself waiting for a long time but it is worth it. Inexpensive.
<P><B>Israeli Fast Food</B> offers the best pizza in the world, especially with green olives. Ditto for falafel and shwarma.

<H1>You Say Orthotic, I Say Orthosis</H1> 
</CENTER>
<P>A molded shoe insert is properly called a foot orthosis. The plural is foot orthoses. But universally, doctors and even laboratories use the term "orthotic." The term orthotic is actually an adjective, not a noun. So ingrained is the improper usage of the word, that many of America's top orthotic (note adjectival use) laboratories use the word "orthotics" as a noun in their name when they mean "orthoses." Many doctors, in discussing the device with patients and even colleagues, call the device an "orthotic." Our sister publication, 
<CITE>BioMechanics,</CITE> is constantly correcting articles by leading experts of 
the biomechanics mainstream who casually use the wrong term in their article submissions.
<P>Indeed, many patients and consumers have now also adopted the bastardization. They also use the term orthotics, as in, "Gee, I heard orthotics could help my running."
<P>It's harder to say the word orthosis. But if you want to impress your doctor or therapist, say "orthosis." Better yet, wait until he makes the mistake and correct him! 
<P>In the meantime, <CITE>Stride</CITE> will use the term in its jargonized form, "orthotic," as an incorrect noun, until we get so much criticism from the doctors we usually criticize for using it wrongly that we switch to the more difficult to pronounce term orthosis. Got that?
<P>--<I>Edwin Black</I>

<H1>How Much Should You Weigh?</H1>


<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n2/weight.gif" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="269" ALT="weight table">
</CENTER>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>The weights of the heavier end of each category are for people with more muscle and bone, such as many men. The weights at the lighter end of each category are for people with less muscle and bone, such as many women. Weights are without clothes or shoes.
<BR><B>SOURCE: <I>Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 1995.</I></B></FONT>
<HR> 

With half a dozen weight tables floating around, all containing different weights that are purportedly "optimal" for good health and a long life, there's no real consensus on what constitutes an "ideal" weight, let alone a "reasonable" weight. So just how do you go about determining your ideal weight?
<P>Start with the latest USDA tables. These tables, based on the latest population studies, reflect the weights that are associated with the fewest health risks and the greatest longevity. The weights in the new tables have been trimmed down since the USDA tables were first released in 1990, and there's no longer an allowance for a substantial weight gain in mid-life. 
<P>"We concur with the revised weight guidelines issued by the USDA," says JoAnn Manson, MD, codirector of Women's Health at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and author of two recent major studies demonstrating increased health risks for overweight women. Keep in mind, however, that the "suggested" weights in the USDA and all standardized tables are just that--a suggestion. Because the tables are based on large populations of people and don't take individual differences into account, the weights in the tables may not be reasonable for all people. 
<P>Because excess body fat, and not lean muscle or bone, is the real problem in terms of elevated health risks, and because weight tables and your average bathroom scale don't differentiate between body weight and body fat, it may be beneficial for your doctor or dietitian to help you determine your percentage of body fat with skin fold calipers or one of the more sophisticated methods of measuring body composition now available. Ask your doctor. Some fitness clubs also routinely provide this service to their clients. 
<P>It's also a good idea to take stock of where the extra weight has accumulated on your body, says Manson. Body fat that accumulates around the abdomen, known as an "apple" body shape, is associated with increased health risks, such as diabetes, heart disease and hypertension. Fat that accumulates around the thighs and buttocks, what's known as a "pear" body shape, still is not good for your health, per se, but may not be as bad as abdominal fat. One easy way to determine your body fat distribution (and potential health risk) is by using the "waist to hip ratio." Use a cloth measuring tape to measure your waist about an inch above your navel. Measure your hips at the widest point between your hips and buttocks. Now divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement. For instance, if your waist measurement is 32 and your hip measurement is 36, your waist-to-hip ratio would be calculated in this way: 32/36 = 0.88. A waist-to-hip ratio greater than 0.80 may signal greater health risks. 
<P> Because of the ongoing controversy over what constitutes a "healthy" or "reasonable" weight, many experts now are moving away from using pure weight as a focal point for change. Some instead are using blood sugar and blood cholesterol levels. Others, like Manson, are encouraging men and women simply to adopt a heart-healthy lifestyle: one that includes a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet and regular moderate exercise. It's probably no coincidence that these are also the safest, surest prescriptions for losing weight--permanently.

<H1>Playing It Safe While Exercising</H1>
</CENTER>

Increasing your exercise level means being more susceptible to certain exercise-related risks, including stress fractures and overheating (hyperthermia). Here are some easy ways to reduce the risks and exercise safely to lose weight.
<P>Get a physical before getting physical. If you are overweight and have been sedentary for more than a year, start with a visit to your doctor--especially if you are more than 30 percent over your "ideal" weight and/or over age 40. Your physician can check for symptomless heart problems, hypertension, diabetes and other medical and/or musculoskeletal conditions (of which you are at a greater risk for just by being overweight) that could influence the amount of exercise you do and the types of activities you choose.
<P>Choose low-impact or no-impact activities. If you are more than 30 percent over the suggested weights for your age in the weight tables, consider starting with non-weight bearing exercises, such as stationary bicycling or swimming, until you lose some weight. These activities put less strain on your lower extremities than such weightbearing activities as jogging and stair-stepping and reduce the risk of joint inflammation and stress injuries, including fractures. Walking is a good and fairly safe activity, but if you are very overweight, you may need to alternate walking with a non-weightbearing activity when you are first starting out. Walking on a treadmill may be better than walking on the street. 
<P>Prevent overheating. Extra body weight makes it more difficult for the body to efficiently cool itself off during strenuous activities, making hyperthermia, or overheating, a real danger for overweight people. To prevent hyperthermia, dress in lightweight, breathable, light-colored clothing, such as cotton or cotton/polyester blends. Don't wear plastic wraps or sweatpants. Drink plenty of fluids before exercise. If you exercise for more than 15 minutes at a time, drink fluids during your session as well. After exercising, replenish fluids lost during exercise. Also, be sure to properly warm up before your exercise session to prepare your body for increased activity, and cool down afterwards to help your body cool off and your heart rate return to normal. 
<P>Wear proper footwear. Extra weight increases the strain that exercise naturally places on your lower extremities, so appropriate, sport-specific shoes are imperative. The right shoes can provide cushioning and support for stressed feet and ankles, and even the lower back. But, according to Carol Frey, MD, extra body weight may make proper shoe fit--a problem for women in general--even more difficult. To ensure proper shoe fit, shop at a store with an informed, experienced staff that fits a shoe to your foot; select shoes based on your weight, foot type (high arch, low arch, curved, straight, a foot that supinates or pronates) and the training surface you're accustomed to exercising on; try on a shoe with the thickness of sock you generally wear for exercise; make sure you have about 1/2-inch of space between your longest toe and the front of the shoe. Make sure your heel fits snugly and doesn't slip. A list of stores in the <CITE>Stride</CITE> movement can be found in the <A HREF="/stride/storelist.html">Comfort Shoe Store List</A>.

<B>1.</B> Don't assume you know your current shoe size. Measure your feet, both length and width, at least once per year. At the same time, size may vary between shoe models. Don't hesitate to try on a shoe in a size other than what measuring indicates. 
<P><B>2.</B> Try walking shoes on with the same thickness of socks you intend to wear. 
<P><B>3.</B> Look for a roomy toebox, and allow at least 1/2- to 3/4-inch of room at the end of the toe for movement and expansion during the heel-to-toe roll of walking. 
<P><B>4.</B> Women should check for adequate room in the ball of the foot (women tend to be wider here) and snug heel fit. 
<P><B>5.</B> Walk in the shoes at your fitness walking pace to gauge fit under typical walking conditions. 
<P><B>6.</B> Try on shoes at the end of day, or better yet, after a workout. That's when your feet are the most swollen. 
<P><B>7.</B> Know your foot type and gait characteristics. Is it normal, flat, or high-arched? (see the <A HREF="#three">Three Foot Types</A>). If you are pronator, look for more medial control.
<P><B>8.</B> Know the difference between walking and running shoes. For instance, walking shoes have more rigidity in the front so you can roll off your toes rather than bend through them as you do in running shoes. Walking shoes need extra shock absorption in the heel of the shoe and especially under the ball of the foot, to help prevent heel pain (see <A HREF="/stride/v1n2/doctor.html">The Doctor's In</A>). A shoe with a slightly rounded sole or "rocker bottom" can help to smoothly shift weight from the heel to the toes as you walk. 
<P><B>9.</B> Frequent a shoe store with a knowledgeable sales staff, preferably staffers who themselves walk for fitness.</B>  
<P><B>10.</B> Rate style low on your appeal list. Some shoes that look great can fall apart quickly. Some shoe companies will tack on bizarre styling or design features for marketing razzle dazzle. Ignore that. Look for solid construction, intelligent design and biomechanical correctness.

<P>The wet imprint of your foot shows the normal connection between forefoot and heel. When walking, the normal foot lands on the outside of the heel and slightly rolls inward (pronates) to absorb shock. This foot needs moderate stability and control features in a walking shoe.
<P>
<P><B>The Flat Foot</B> 
<P>This imprint shows the whole foot, a low or nearly missing arch. The flat foot usually exhibits a great deal of pronation--striking on the outside of the heel and rolling inward excessively. The flat-footed walker needs a shoe with maximum stability and control, and should avoid highly cushioned, curve-lasted shoes. 
<P>
<P><B>The High-Arched Foot</B> 
<P>This imprint leaves either no connection or a very narrow band connecting forefoot and heel. This is a stiffer foot because it underpronates, and consequently does not absorb shock well. The walker with a high arch needs a highly cushioned sole with maximum shock absorption plus a great deal of flexibility to facilitate proper foot motion. Curve-lasted shoes with high arch support are also helpful. The high arched person should stay away from heavy motion-control shoes which can make gait unstable and may even promote an ankle injury.

<A HREF="/stride/v1n2/"><IMG SRC="/stride/stride.gif" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="58" ALT="Stride logo"></A>

<H1>Fashion Horse Sense:
<BR>The Lifestyle Collection</H1>
<P><I>by Elizabeth Black</I>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="/stride/v1n2/clogs.jpg" WIDTH="134" HEIGHT="82">
<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>Why do non-riders on streets like Rodeo Drive wear Ariat riding boots? The fashion appeal may have something to do with the form-fitting qualities of an English-style riding boot. "The boot can't be bulky. It needs to follow the shape of the foot so the foot slides easily into a stirrup, and also slips out smoothly when you dismount," explains Pam Parker, Ariat co-founder. It also needs a well-defined heel to keep the foot positioned in the stirrup. A riding boot's sleek lines and stacked heel are flattering, but unlike typical fashion boots, Ariat offers all the elements of comfort shoes--stability, cushioning, and arch support. Indeed, Ariat's "Lifestyle Collection" is a fashion adaptation of their riding boots, but Lifestyle models feature softer, more delicate leather uppers. Inside, the shoes are the same. 
<P>Mindful of the enduring American love affair with cowboy boots, Ariat has also designed several Western style boots--but not those pointed toe styles which constrict toes and nominate wearers for bunions. Ariat opts instead for a more rounded toebox typical of the roper-style Western boot. 
<P>Of Ariat's nine Lifestyle models, the sport mule may be this season's biggest hit off the trail. Actually it's inspired by the traditional English grooming clog worn around the stables while performing chores. You'll find them in English tack shops as well as in fashion shoe stores.

<B>1.</B> Don't assume you know your current shoe size. Measure your feet, both length and width, at least once per year. At the same time, size may vary between shoe models. Don't hesitate to try on a shoe in a size other than what measuring indicates. 
<P><B>2.</B> Try walking shoes on with the same thickness of socks you intend to wear. 
<P><B>3.</B> Look for a roomy toebox, and allow at least 1/2- to 3/4-inch of room at the end of the toe for movement and expansion during the heel-to-toe roll of walking. 
<P><B>4.</B> Women should check for adequate room in the ball of the foot (women tend to be wider here) and snug heel fit. 
<P><B>5.</B> Walk in the shoes at your fitness walking pace to gauge fit under typical walking conditions. 
<P><B>6.</B> Try on shoes at the end of day, or better yet, after a workout. That's when your feet are the most swollen. 
<P><B>7.</B> Know your foot type and gait characteristics. Is it normal, flat, or high-arched? (see the <A HREF="#three">Three Foot Types</A>). If you are pronator, look for more medial control.
<P><B>8.</B> Know the difference between walking and running shoes. For instance, walking shoes have more rigidity in the front so you can roll off your toes rather than bend through them as you do in running shoes. Walking shoes need extra shock absorption in the heel of the shoe and especially under the ball of the foot, to help prevent heel pain. A shoe with a slightly rounded sole or "rocker bottom" can help to smoothly shift weight from the heel to the toes as you walk. 
<P><B>9.</B> Frequent a shoe store with a knowledgeable sales staff, preferably staffers who themselves walk for fitness.</B>  
<P><B>10.</B> Rate style low on your appeal list. Some shoes that look great can fall apart quickly. Some shoe companies will tack on bizarre styling or design features for marketing razzle dazzle. Ignore that. Look for solid construction, intelligent design and biomechanical correctness.

<P>No medals are awarded for prosthetic repair, but that doesn't mean it wasn't an event at the Atlanta Paralympics. Under the auspices of the O&#38;P National Office, some 70 certified orthotists and prosthetists worked with represented companies like a top relay team to deliver unprecedented aid. They adjusted, repaired, and even sometimes rebuilt prostheses on site. They ensured nearly instant access to virtually every kind of component. And in some cases they referred athletes off-site to private facilities, which were also eager to help. 
<P>"I think the effort was much more effective this time, which is good because more people were interested in our services," said John Michael, CPO and director of technical and professional services for Otto Bock. This is not the first appearance for Otto Bock's containers. They'd had a presence at the Barcelona Paralympics, where Michael estimates half as many repairs were done, which he guesses affected about 1 percent of the 3,500 athletes assembled in Spain.
<P>Over the course of 10 days, Paralympians required about 300 fixes. Most of those repairs were handled at two portable, fully-equipped orthopedic workshops called "containers," donated by Otto Bock. The one-room, high-tech stations were set up like a prosthetic lab with ovens, workbenches, grinders, polishing tools, and phone and fax machines for component restocking. Located near Chaney Stadium and the Olympic Village, the containers were open 12 hours a day. Athletes could also call volunteers to reopen the workshops for emergency repairs. 
<P>But this time around the containers were officially "provided" by the O&#38;P Athletic Assistance fund and stocked with components from many companies. "In Barcelona, Otto Bock was the sole provider of O&#38;P services," said Brad Ruhl, sales and marketing director for Otto Bock. 
"This year there was a very sound organization of volunteers. And this year the O&#38;P field in the U.S. tried to do everything under a joint effort--that's why the fund became the official provider, and companies tried not to go individually, but under that banner." 
<P>Most prosthetic adjustments at the containers or at the events themselves, where volunteers also were stationed, took mere minutes. "The key thing was to do it on the spot," Michael said. "Ninety percent were done 'while you wait.'" But the volunteers were also capable of responding quickly to bigger emergencies, as when American Dennis Oehler cracked the lamination of his BK prosthesis in the long jump trials and needed it rebuilt at the Chaney container site before the next morning's 100-meter final. (Paralympic rules dictated that repairs or replacements for athletes must be the same or comparable to the technology they already had--no upgrades or downgrades allowed.) Or when the flag bearer from Denmark showed up with her BK prosthesis cracked top to bottom and had it rebuilt within two days, before her debut at the Opening Ceremonies, at an off-site, private facility.
<P>"It was an enormous success," said Michael Joyce, CP and director of O&#38;P operations, of his crew's effort at the Atlanta Games. "It went so well that no one recognized that we did what we did. Without us there would have been some major news stories, like Dennis Oehler. He might not have been able to compete. Or maybe they would have wrapped his leg with fiberglass and made it heavy. Just being there and being able to help him compete was worth it." 
<P> And what of the 2000 Paralympics in Australia? "We could do this because it was here in America," Joyce said. "What we can hope for is that we've created the model and they'll follow it."

<STRONG>Heat Mold Direct in Shoe</STRONG>

<P>After placing insole into shoe, direct heat gun into shoe for approximately 30 seconds. Test for moldability with finger impression.
<BR><B>Caution: Do Not Heat Above 130 Degrees</B>
<BR>When moldable, have patient wearing heavy cotton or wool socks step into shoe, then walk and stand until cool for a permanent impression.

<P>
<B>Moldable Insoles May Be Spot Molded</B>
<BR>Insoles may be spot adjusted to accommodate plantar excrescencies such as corns, callouses and depressed metatarsal heads. It is recommended to heat mold the insoles to the shoe and foot first, then a transferable mark is placed on the patient's sock at the location of the excrescency. Lipstick works well. Then put the foot into the shoe and have the patient take a few steps until this mark is transferred onto the insole. Remove the insole and follow Steps 1 through 5 as needed to make a complete accommodation.

<P>
<P><IMG SRC="/graphics/note01.gif" WIDTH=101 HEIGHT=101 ALT="quill and paper">I welcome the premiere of <I>Stride</I> magazine. America is now discovering the benefits of lower extremity health. But they need solid information that can cut through the misinformation promoted by much of the media. That's where <I>Stride</I> comes in. The editors of <I>Stride</I> have the background needed from their other publication, <I>Biomechanics,</I> to separate fact from fiction. Good luck. We know you'll hit the ground running.

<P>You've always had a broad interest 
in the health care disciplines, and this is a terrific chance to pull a number of 
disparate interests into a well-focused picture.

<P><IMG SRC="/graphics/note01.gif" WIDTH=101 HEIGHT=101 ALT="quill and paper">Congratulations on the premiere of <I>Stride</I> magazine. The public needs to discover its lower extremities and the benefits of good foot and leg health. To do so, they need information that's both accurate and accessible. That's where <I>Stride,</I> whose editors are well-suited for the task, comes in. Based on the success of <I>Biomechanics,</I> I have no doubt that <I>Stride</I> will soar.

It is so important to help motivate people toward physical action. We know all the terrible consequences of inactivity, but we rationalize around doing anything about it.
<P><I>Stride,</I> I believe, will provide the motivational knowledge that can make a big difference in behavior leading to health and on to fitness.

<P><IMG SRC="/graphics/note01.gif" WIDTH=101 HEIGHT=101 ALT="quill and paper">Congratulations on the launch of <I>Stride</I> magazine. It's about time that someone went directly to consumers with the wealth of scientific information available concerning lower leg problems and products. While <I>Consumer Reports</I> helps people with many types of purchases, there has yet to be a mechanism for communicating information from the science lab to the general public. yet the public is spending billions per year on over-the-counter footcare products. I wish <I>Stride</I> magazine success in its attempt to provide more direction to those making these purchases and to help the public walk and exercise with more comfort. Based on the job you have done with <I>Biomechanics,</I> you will be successful.

narrow your search further specify more than 1 minimum term for each

Along with their staff Matt (Gary's son) Bill & Ryan they know that customer service is the key to their success.<br><br>
	The store located at 1703 Lakeshore Rd. West  Mississauga (Clarkson) is the former location of CWS Sports. Gary has worked at that location for many years.  He has a strong desire to return the store to its glory days when it was owned by Rob Walton.<br><br>
	I  met Gary and Rob about 10 years ago when my family first moved to the Lorne Park- Clarkson area.  From the first day I walked in, to buy my sons baseball shoes, I have been doing business at that location.  Both, Rob and Gary knew their stuff.  Although I became very goods friends with Gary, I was really saddened by the death of Rob on June 9, 1993.  With his passing, things just weren't the same at the old store anymore.<br><br>
	Over the years of doing business with Gary I learned a great deal about sports equipment and how important service really is.  Quality equipment and fit are of paramount importance to parents and athletes alike.  Regardless whether the young inspiring athlete is playing at the house league level or all-star level, quality equipment, fit and safety go hand in hand. Gary is without a doubt a "Specialist" in his field.<br>
	With the opening of CLP SPORTS in December 1996, it won't take Gary and Nick long to established a solid base of customers to build their business on.  They know what it will take to make their business a success.  They'll provide quality service and equipment that will keep their customers coming back year after year just as  I have been doing with my family.<br><br>
	With their store front  in the Cyber Mall at www.Scoreboard-Canada.com Canadians from coast to coast can browse their products and order directly from the comforts of their own homes.  If you need advice or have special needs, give them a call.  I have heard stories of how Bill and Gary take great pride in helping the physically challenged get the most out of their sport   	With Gary and Nick at the helm of CLP, I am  very pleased to welcome them on board at <br><br>
www.SCOREBOARD-CANADA.com.  Don't just drop into their store and browse, buy something!  You will be glad you did.<br><br>

<center><b><font color=red><h2><u>FROM SCOREBOARD-CANADA'S 1001 BASEBALL INSTRUCTIONAL IDEA'S</h2></FONT></CENTER></u><br>

<center><font color=blue><b><h3>Published and Produced By Ron Hicks. If you wish to obtain a full copy e-mail us at: <a href=mailto:ronh@avn-net.com>RonH@avn-net.com</a></center></b></font>


<b>100  SELF-DISCIPLINE</b><br>
Baseball teaches self-discipline through hard work and sacrifices necessary to achieve a goal.  
There is no shortcuts to success.  Baseball is the same life, you have to work to accomplish 
anything and preparation is everything.<br><br>  

Leaders are not born, they are made.  To be a leader, you have to know your stuff.  You have to make people want to follow you.  They do not want to follow somebody who does not know where he or she is going.<br> <br> 

<b>101  BASEBALL PLAYERS' RIGHTS</b><br> 
1.  The right to decide the level, intensity and involvement, at which they wish to compete.<br> 
2.  Regardless of physical ability or importance of the game, they have the right to play.<br> 
3.  The right to freedom from physical and emotional punishment by a parent or coach.<br> 
4.  The right to have coaches and parents who are supportive despite ability or potential.<br> 
5.  The right to have a coach who places the child first, the team second, him or herself third,  
     and winning fourth.<br> 
6.  The right to report to a coach or parent any physical pain or emotional concerns, such as a  
     fear of rejection, without fear of ridicule.<br><br>  

<b>102  THE COACH HAS RIGHTS TOO!</b><br> 
1.  The right to be respected for his or her commitment to the team, by both parents and players,
     regardless of age or experience.<br> 
2.  The right to have the commitment of his or her players and their parents to maintain 
     discipline and order.<br> 
3.  The right to expect the parents to attend the team's functions and give support, wherever
      they can.<br> 
4.  The right to be" honest with his players and their parents."<br> 
5.  The right to fail, despite how bad the decision was, regarding strategy.<br> <br> 

<b>103  BEING A "TEAM PLAYER"</b><br> 
The enjoyment of playing baseball begins when one can accept the idea of a workable system,
of organization and planning.  Playing and coaching in one of the most difficult team sports, starts with the "RIGHT ATTITUDE."<br> 
Some thoughts on developing the "RIGHT ATTITUDE:<br>               
1.  Pitcher - Pitch to give your team a chance to win.<br> 
2.  Keep sight of your goals.<br> 
3.  Remember who you are and what you are trying to accomplish.<br> 
4.  Have a plan, be committed and get focused.<br> 
5.  Always be willing to learn.<br> 
6.  Be prepared for a lot of hard work.<br> 
7.  Learn the game by studying it.<br> 
8.   Do you know what separates the average player from a good player?
      Their heart, their drive, their intellect.<br> 
9.   Play to your strengths and work on your weaknesses.<br> 
10. Commitment too mental, and physical conditioning.<br> 
11. Never show up other team, or a team member, the best revenge is success.<br> <br> 


<b>104 A THOUGHT FROM - EARL WEAVER</b><br> 
"It's what you learn after you think you know everything that counts."<br>

<B>
Until she met me this gal was known as AL-EE-YAA... today she has been transformed into Alia. Probably wouldn't have made it through frosh without her... she's really a nice girl (sometimes) She's also fun to snow job... when she let's us! </P>

<P>
<IMG SRC="friends/Roomies.jpg" align=right>

Meet Kim, Liz,Darryl, Juanita,and Andrew... my Roomies (the guys). Riz is also another roomie but doesn't do the Formal thing, so he's not in the picture (Trust me he's too cute for this snap ). These are the guys I share air, food, drinks, and laughs with. Besides fightin' about whose turn it is to do the dishes... or the bass coming out of my room... these guys are pretty cool (for country folk that is : ) )  As for Liz and Kim... probably the cutest gals on the floor... especially Liz... she's a great cook... and nows how to party. Kim... well.... ever been introduced to an Angel before? Kim this is cyberspace...Cyberspace meet Kim!
</P>

<P>
<IMG SRC="friends/Babes.jpg" ALT="Babes.jpg - 51.4 K" ALIGN=right>

Meet Karen, Jo, Emily, and Christie (YES She's taken!). These are the babes down the hall. When ever I need a laugh, or just a place to chill dat's the place. These gals know how to party to.... Without Jo..I probably would never have passed philosophy...without karen I probably would never have gotten a virus on my notebook... without Emily... hmm... I probably wouldn't have been such a nice guy (compared to Julio.. everybodies a nice guy!!).. and without Christie... who would I have someone to gossip with about super bitch???
</P>

<P> <IMG SRC="friends/Sharime.jpg" align=right>

Meet Shari....the hottest Jewish Babe on Campus!! I'm not sure I'd even be here right now without my Favorite VP in da whole wide world... she's more than a VP though.... she's a friend.. eternally (unless I get sick of midnight chats.. then it's out the door baby!) Actually if you ever need someone to make you smile... give you a hug... or just sit there and be really dumb... call her 1-800-I -AM-A -GEEK!!! (Just don't feed her grapes!!!) btw... Ochta..Ohevet...Octet.. or something like that : )

</center><p> <strong>Dynamic Billboard</strong><br>
by Robert Temple<p>

<b>FEATURES</b><br>

Steps through any number of images displaying them one at a time.
Transitions from one image to the next are done with special effects.
Images may have URL links associated with them.<p>

Transitions included:
<ul>
<li>Column Shift
<li>Fade
<li>Rotate
<li>Tear
<li>Smash
<li>Unroll
</ul>
Watch for all the Transitions.  They occur randomly, but never the same
one consecutively.<p>

Features:
<ul>
<li><b><i>Quick Content</i></b>: Gets first image to the screen as 
fast as possible.
<li><b><i>Load when needed</i></b>: Images and transition classes are only 
loaded when they are needed.
<li><b><i>Random</i></b>: The first image is chosen from the parameters 
at random.  Transitions types are also done at 
random, and the same transition type will never 
be used consecutively.
<li><b><i>Effecient</i></b>: Much care was taken to keep the applet kind 
to your computer's processor and memory.  <i><font size=-1>It runs 
perfectly on my 486/DX2 w/8MB over a 14.4k modem.</font></i>
<li><b><i>Configurable</i></b>: Change the delay between images, the 
images, and the transition classes through html parameters.
<li><b><i>Expandable</i></b>: Creating new transitions is easy for the 
Java programmer, using a well documented base class.
</ul>

<CENTER><P>There, now I&nbsp;got a small philez section, its under Hackin'
it has only to do with phreaking and anarchy .... but that is still hacking
in a way. So don't bitch, I am still looking around for more philez that
are related to hacking.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>08/16/96</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Ok, well still no filez, unless some1 will let me use there
ftp site, either for linking off your files, or I can go around and find
some to u/l to your site. For now, I have added some linkz and took out
dead linkz, e-mail if you have any other ideas.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>08/05/96</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Well thats enough of those God Damn frames, they looked great

<H1>CHRISTMAS ANIMATED GIF CONTEST</H1>
<HR>
Readers of <A HREF="people.htm"> Sandy McMurray's</A> column in the Toronto Sun know that he's holding a contest for the best animated Christmas GIF.  So in the spirit of giving, here is my entry.<P>

<H1>The Java GateKeeper is Here.</H1>
<HR>
I now have a password page to personalize my web site.  The first prototype
is my <B><I>Friends and Family Page</I></B>.  To gain access to my Christmas letter, you have to enter the name of the city where I was born and raised.  It's not hard but the information it guards is not valuable either.<P>
Try the <A HREF="http://www.avn-net.com/users/gyoshida/gate.htm">Java GateKeeper.</A><P>
<HR>
<H1>INTERNET HIGHLIGHTS</H1>
<HR>
There is increasing use of the internet.  Retailers, advertisers, computer companies, communication companies, governments, etc.  are beginning to realize how the computer network to the internet is magnifying the powers of information advertising.<P>
Here are two examples of how your shopping appetites are being teased by computer companies.  Microsoft made a web site the can show car buyers what they come down to the new car showrooms to see for themselves, the interiors of the cars.<P>
Surround Vision gives you, the viewer, a rotating, 360' view of the interiors of new cars.  The features and options available are listed.  You do have to download some software so if your in a hurry, you can skip this one.<P>
Click here for <A HREF="http://www.carpoint.com/">car interiors.</A>
<P>
A retail shopping center is currently advertising its web site.  With Christmas approaching, wouldn't you much rather shop at home.  Here is a trip to
<A HREF="http://www.fairviewmall.com">a real mall.</A>
<HR>
<H1>Cliff Stoll, displaced astonomer and network expert.</H1>
<HR>
This is a new page on my web site.  Cliff Stoll was a displaced astonomer at Berkley when a computer spy from Europe snuck into his computer.  It took a year and a half but Cliff eventually caught him.  The story made the New York Times and Cliff went on to write a book.<P>
Cliff Stoll wears tie dye T shirts and is not a Bill Gates.  Bill learned his computing early on in a classroom and is now a business man who watches the bottom line.  Cliff learned computing at the University of Berkley and went on to catch a spy because of a 75 cent accounting error all the while paying the bills for this research.<P>
Now, Cliff's working on computer networks has led him smack dab into the middle of the Internet. <P>

<HR>  
<H1><I>SHOOT OUT</I> HAS CHANGED.</H1>
<LI>Shoot Out has now been on the information highway for a month now.  The reaction has been favourable.  A common complaint was the hint list was too easy.<P>
I've changed the scoring pattern and removed the hint list so I hope the experience is fresh again.<P>

The front cover depicts our logo. True North points in the direction
of Canada and symbolizes the integrity of the nation and its people.
The arrow aiming north is the pathfinder, a guide to Canada which is
represented here by the red maple leaf, the national symbol of our
country. The majestic maple adorns this northern nation from coast
to coast, displaying its leaves of green, gold, and red during the different
seasons which Canadians enjoy.

The front cover depicts our logo. True North points in the direction
of Canada and symbolizes the integrity of the nation and its people.
The arrow aiming north is the pathfinder, a guide to Canada which is
represented here by the red maple leaf, the national symbol of our
country. The majestic maple adorns this northern nation from coast
to coast, displaying its leaves of green, gold, and red during the different
seasons which Canadians enjoy.

<p>Since 1988 Christopher T. Nielsen has observed a few changes in legislation
affecting the insurance industry. The era of Tort law came to an end in 
June of 1990 with "No Fault Insurance" and the introduction of the
 Ontario Motorist Protection Plan.  In January of 1994, BILL 164 provided additional
 changes to the no fault system. Most recently the Insurance Act 
Amendment of BILL 59 has again changed the accident benefit's schedule.</p>

<br><H2>Professional Experience</H2></center><BR>
February  1995 to September 1995<BR>
Ontario Science Centre, <BR>
North York Ontario <BR>
Challenger Centre Assistant<BR>

<p>I began work at  the Science Centre as part of my schools co-op program  in February 1995, assigned to the Challenger Centre, which is part of the Educational Programs branch. </p>

<p>The Challenger Centre is a space mission simulator, complete with mission control and spacecraft, a computer network and several television cameras. Challenger Centre programs (referred to as Missions) require participants to experiment, calculate and navigate using computers, robots and equipment with the help of their team-mates and manuals. During  these Missions I helped students in their task during the mission as well as occasionally running the computer aspect of the simulation and dealing with technical problems that arose. My other responsibilities included floor work (supervising areas like the auditorium during events), a small degree of HTML authoring  and Challenger Centre maintenance. </P>

<p>At the end of my co-op term the Science Centre offered me a contract in a similar capacity, for summer 1995 I was to continue assisting the Challenger Centre staff as well as HTML authoring for the Challenger Centre, Educational Programs Branch and Starlab (The Science Centre planetarium run by Ivan Semineuk). I was assigned to a group preparing for a visit by the Governor of New Jersey, I helped two children author web pages and presented them during the Governors Visit. </P>

<H3><A NAME="rational"></A>Yes, I Rationalize My Golf Game!</H3>
<HR>
I use to try and play golf by the rules.  That was back when I reached the green on a par five in 8 strokes.  Now, I play a more realistic game and set realistic goals for myself.  Am I cheating or playing golf in the 90's?<P>
I give myself prefered lies whenever I want.  This violates the age old tenet to play the golf ball as it lies.  Everyone knows that.  But sometimes you can be playing terrifically and then suddenly wind up behind a tree with no hope of reaching the green.  Here, I treat myself like a weak and wounded soul and without shame, toss my ball four feet away from the offending tree.  If it lands in the fairway, so be it!<P> 
Still, a golfer with more heart would manufacture a shot soley designed to advance the ball further toward the hole.  I have neither the metal nor the heart to do that.<P>
I take comfort in the knowledge that my mother's golf teacher told his students they could actually tee up their golf balls through the green using golf tees.  In harsh moments of reality though, I am sobered by the truth that I am not his student.<P>
I suppose a benchmark test for golfers is that they will willingly sacrifice a stroke solely to advance the ball.  It is a purposeful shot necessary to the game.  Now I don't enjoy playing sand shots but I know that I need that shot in order to play decently.  So I learned how to make a sand shot.  Maybe I will someday see a manufactured shot in the same light.<P>
It could be the sign of maturity to play golf by the rules but I've seen too many beginners and others waste everyone's time by trying to play above their heads.  Golf is a difficult game and I would much rather rely on crutches than give it up entirely.<P>

<H3><A NAME="ball"></A>Second Thoughts on Carrying an Extra Ball</H3>
<HR>
In my list of golf tips, I suggest that you should carry an extra golf ball in your pocket so that if you have to play another ball (imagine that you can't find the ball you played or want to hit a <I>mulligan</I>) you don't have to go trudging back to your golf bag. <P>
I put this tip on Golf Digest's website and two other readers responded.  The first  writer replied that you should never do this because you may be accused of cheating.  I answer this point by saying that I don't play golf competively. Therefore, I am in no danger of being accused of cheating anyone.  For me, the advantages of keeping a spare golf ball handy far outweigh this objection.  Furthermore, I believe that the  rule book does not prohibit carrying another golf ball in your pocket although there are of course, stipulations about putting that golf ball into play.  <P>
Therefore, I see nothing wrong with my golf tip.<P>
The second writer?  He advised me not to play golf with the first writer.<P>

<H3><A NAME="concede"></A>A Lesson in Graciousness</H3>
<HR>
I have always learned about golf by referring to books and magazines and by watching golf on TV.  When I'm lucky, I watch the better golfers and the pros when they come to Glenn Abbey.  But it has only been through experience that I have made any advancements at all.<P>
I once thought that you should never concede a putt.  I wanted to play golf the way they played on TV.  And I thought that it was a weakness until I played with a stranger in Myrtle Beach.<P>
I had just reached the green of a difficult par 5 in regulation and came up about four feet short with my approach putt.  The man I was playing with, a stranger really, conceded the putt to me with good feelings for playing this difficult par 5 so well.<P>
But I insisted on putting the ball out and of course, I missed the putt.  All the man said was that sometimes you should accept a conceded putt.<P>
I will not hesitate to concede a putt.  Sometimes, it's the only way to stop the bleeding.  Heck, I even concede putts to myself.  And if sometime someone conceded a puttand I accepted, I know it doesn't matter if I hit the putt anyway and miss.  Once a putt has been conceded, thats the only stroke that counts.<P>
<H5>The Rationalization</H5>
The reason I do this is because it is enough of a challenge to play the ball cleanly from tee to green.  And if I reached a difficult par 5 in three strokes, I want to reward that acheivemnt rather than standing by helplessly watching it being obliterated by a flurry of putts.  It could easily happend that a hole I wanted to remember could end up being a double bogey on the scorecard without a lot of difficulty.<P>

<H3><A NAME="meg"></A>Meg Mallon is a winner.</H3>
<HR>
Meg Mallon may not make it to the LPGA Hall of Fame.  It is one of the most difficult Halls of Fame to enter in professional sport.  But she is a woman golfer who first caught my eye when she won the U.S. Open.<P>
Meg is no fluke and is showing a solid performance on the LPGA tour.  And, she was once voted the Most Friendly Player on the tour by her fellow pros.  Her place in history is assured but someone, somewhere will note that she was once disqualified from a tournament for waiting too long for a putt to drop.<P>
The ruling was that a player can only wait ten seconds for a putt to drop before playing it.  A camera displaying a clock captured her waiting twenty-one seconds before the ball fell into the hole.  Since she thought the putt had dropped legally, she only counted one stroke and was disqualified that evening for signing an incorrect scorecard.  It was harsh but equitable treatment.<P>

<H3><A NAME="trouble"></A>Play Away From Trouble</H3> 
<HR>
Whenever I reach a fairway with trouble on one side, I've learned to avoid the disaster of landing in that trouble by teeing the ball up and hitting away from it.  A typical hole has a highway or an out of bounds or deep forest along the left hand side of the fairway.  By teeing the ball up on the left side as well and aiming for the centre of the fairway, you make it less likely that a pulled shot will put you over the brink.<P>
A psychologist once said that by thinking about trouble spots, you only give your mind a target to hit making it that much harder to avoid.  The same thing applies here.  Even your eyes, when looking down to the middle of the fairway are facing away from the woods, or highway, or pond behind you.  Every little bit helps and like most good things in golf, you can help yourself even before you swing the golf club.<P>

<A NAME="bad"></A>
<HR>
<H3>You are starting to play <I>badly</I>.  What do you do now?</H3> 
<HR>
<LI>Give yourself two points for putting yourself up against a challenge and being out there to play to begin with.  Golf is still a game even to people who make their money from it.
<P>
<LI>Forget about going for distance.  Try for clean, solid hits that go a little straighter.  
<P>
<LI>Cheat!  Move the ball away from the bush.  Kick it out of the rough back onto the fairway.  Give yourself the three foot putts that you can't make anyway.  Give youself a chance to make a reasonable score that you will want to remember instead of forget.
<P>
<LI>Stop trying to make the shots that you can't make, at least not yet!
<P>
<LI>Throw away the score card.   This seems to be the most sportsmanlike solution. 
<P>
<LI>Stop counting every stroke you take unless of course you don't really value the time you are spending on the golf course.
<P> 
<LI>Learn to play better.   You may need to practise, exercise, strengthen, change your mind or your attitude, take golf lessons, any number of things.

<H3><A NAME="synthetic golf glove"></A>Wear a Synthetic Glove</H3>
<HR>
<P>
For some players, a synthetic golf glove makes a lot of sense.  It will last all season long because it will never dry out and crack like a leather golf glove.  And it doesn't require any special care.  You can throw it in your golf bag and the heat of the car trunk will not affect it.<P>
Synthetic golf gloves have improved with technology.  They are thin, comfortable and some have a leather insert in the palm.  Your grip will not suffer and your hand is still protected from blisters and sore spots.<P>
The pros change their golf gloves every round or even during a round.  But they get all their golf equipment free.  For the average player, buying two or three golf gloves a season can be expensive.  So consider this cost saving alternative.  I promise you'll be glad you explored all of your options.<P>

<H3><A NAME="golf score"></A>Mental Messages</H3>
<HR>
<P>
If you ever played the game of golf to shoot a good golf score, Tom Kite,  U.S. Open winner and his  golf psychologist,  Dr. Bob Rotella have a CD called  "Golf. Lower Your Score!" that is a real winner.<P>
The CD features great messages on golf by both Tom Kite and Dr. Rotella that is good enough to help you win the club championship.  Add some pretty interesting videos and this is a valuable CD to own.<P>
The first message to remember is that the purpose of golf is to shoot as low a score as possible.  Golfers often loose sight of this goal when they tinker with their golf swing and become too absorbed in mechanicals details that have nothing to do with their ultimate objective.<P>
Another Tom Kite tip is that you have to hit a square, solid shot consistently.  Even a beginner can learn faster once he or she has experienced hitting the golf ball squarely and solidly.<P>
Dr. Rotella adds some valuable insights into how the human mind works so that we can be mentally prepared to play golf.  His powerful mental messages can also be a key to success in real life as well.<P>

<H3><A NAME="ball mark"></A>Mark Your Golf Ball</H3>
<HR>
Golf balls come in many brands and the golf course is filled with a large number of golf balls at any one time.  You will discover if you play golf long enough that despite the odds, you and another player may find you have both played the same ball and now you cannot distinguish between them.  This is why you should mark your golf ball with some permanent marker.<P>
You would be suprised how colourful and creative the pros are when it comes to marking their own golf ball.  One player draws pictures on his ball but unusual as this is, he has fulfilled his purpose:  He can always identify his own golf ball.<P>
I draw an X on my golf balls.  What would you choose?<P>

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="nugget"></A>Carry a "Nugget" in Your Pocket</H3>
<HR>
To save time, carry an extra golf ball or two in your pocket at all times.  Then, when you hit a ball out of bounds or loose it in the woods, you won't have to walk all the way back to your golf bag to get another ball.  This not only saves time for everyone but also spares you an embarrasing walk, especially at the first tee.<P>
The pros call this extra golf ball a "nugget" to remind themselves that it is too valuable to hit recklessly.  Of course, a pro seldom loses a golf ball and also has the help of a caddy.<P>
By the way, did you know you are allowed five minutes to look for a lost golf ball?  This rule gives you a good opportunity to find an errant shot but doesn't stop play indefinitely.<P>

<H3><A NAME="ready"></A>Learn to play Ready Golf</H3>
<HR>
Traditionally, the person with the best score on the last hole gets to hit first off the next tee.  That is called "having the honour".  But this tradition is a horror show in today's fast paced world where time is at a premium.<P> 
Many golf courses ask their members to play Ready Golf to speed up play.  Ready Golf means that whoever is ready to hit has the right to go ahead, irregardless of how he scored on the previous hole.  The advantage is obvious.  No one has to stand around waiting and everyone gets to play a faster round.<P>
Another time saving tip is to let the shortest player hit first.  That way, the whole group is not kept waiting while the group ahead gets out of range of the longer hitters.<P>
I'm all for anything that speeds up play.  If you have some other suggestions, please email me.<P>

<H3><A NAME="look ahead"></A>Keeping Pace</H3>
<HR>
Keeping pace is important to learn for everyone's enjoyment of the game.  Be aware of how fast the group ahead of you is playing.  Maybe you'd be suprised that the group you thought was slow is actually playing much faster and that you were the culprit slowing the foursome behind you.<P>
Beginners and especially golfers who are trying to perform unrealistically should learn that keeping pace is a good time management tool.  No matter how badly you want to play well or to make the perfect golf swing, sooner or later, you have to pull the trigger.  Playing golf even when you don't feel completely confident still counts.  That is why we play.  You can shoot a good score without perfection so don't hesitate to pick up your speed of play.  You'll be just as happy with the results and the group waiting behind you will respect your play.<P>

<H1>Golf in November</H1>
<HR>
Today I shot an 89 at my local course but I can't complain.  The ground was wet but the weather was mild and the cloudy day never turned to rain.  This is probably my last round this year.<P>
Now I have to pay attention to my golf clubs and golf shoes.<P>
Soon to come is the Callaway Handicap System.  This is the handicap system used at company golf tournaments where everyone gets a handicap.<P>

 <b>Meet Kim, a girl who rocks my world. From the moment we met the future began. Started out being friends... ended up.... who knows? This is the kinda girl you can talked about anything too....ANYTHING! She'll always understand, never get mad, and on top of it all never be fully convinced I'm right... which is a good thing... If you ever need a smile that'll make you feel warm all over.. just look into her eyes (yes they smile)!<BR><BR>

This was us at Wilfrid Laurier's Formal 96.... a magical evening indeed.</b>

<BR>
Cliff Stoll has written two books on computer networks that are worth reading, especially because his research makes them an anthology of computer networks from the<I></I> eighties until the 1990's.<P>
<HR>
<I><B>The Cuckoo's Egg</B></I> is the story that made the front page of the New York Times in March, 1989.  A computer spy in Europe worked his way accross a network of computers to and through a computer in the basement of the Lawrence Berkley Lab building where Cliff, a displaced astronomer, worked as one of the computer wizards who ran the computer centre.<P>
<HR>
His second book, <I><B>Silicon Snake Oil</B></I> is full of reservations about computers and networks.  Since the Internet is so prominent, it shares much of the spotlight  but Cliff shows it in a much different light.<P>
<HR>
I have selected the following links from searches on Excite, Magellan, Lycos, Yahoo, and Infoseek.  Cliff's email address is from page 156 of <I>Silicon Snake Oil.</I><P>

<A HREF="http://www.bok.net/pajol/">Africains sans papiers de Saint-Ambroise</A><br>
<font size=5>T</font>HREE HUNDRED AFRICAN PEOPLE have been figthing for
more than five month to obtain regular papers. Their action began with the
occupation of St. Ambroise church in Paris. A &quot;college of
mediators&quot; composed with distinguished french personalities tried
unsuccessfully to negotiate with the French government. Today, nearly all
the &quot;paperless&quot; aliens are threatened to be deported. Ten of
them have been on hunger strike for fifty two days. This case happens at
the time when the French government is critisized for its human rights
violations by the international community (see <A
HREF="gopher://gopher.undp.org:70/00/undocs/eed/E/CN.4/1995/95_07/78">Glele's

<p>
<font size=5>T</font>ROIS CENTS AFRICAINS luttent depuis plus de cinq mois
pour obtenir la r&eacute;gularisation de leurs papiers. Leur action a
commenc&eacute; par l'occupation de l'&eacute;glise Saint-Ambroise
&agrave; Paris.  Un &#171;&nbsp;coll&egrave;ge de
m&eacute;diateurs&nbsp;&#187;  form&eacute; de personnalit&eacute;s
fran&ccedil;aises &eacute;minentes a tent&eacute; sans succ&egrave;s de
n&eacute;gocier avec le gouvernement. Aujourd'hui, la
quasi-totalit&eacute; de ces &#171;&nbsp;sans papiers&nbsp;&#187; est
menac&eacute;e d'expulsion, et dix d'entre eux ont men&eacute; une
gr&egrave;ve de la faim de plus de cinquante jours.  Cette affaire
intervient alors que la France est critiqu&eacute;e par la
communaut&eacute; internationale pour ses atteintes aux droits de l'homme

De homepage van KnoopPunt bestaat uit een drieledige boomstructuur. De stam is de
hoofindex, met daarop eerst dikke takken, en daarop dan nog eens dunnere takken. De eigenlijke vruchten, de informatie, vind je op de dunne takken.
<br><br>
hoofdindex<br>
<blockquote>
subindex<br>
<blockquote>
subindex en/of info
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

Op het eerste subniveau vind men:
<dl>
<dt>Wat:Nieuws
<dd>Geeft toegang tot een aantal nieuwsdatabanken gerangschikt per onderwerp.
Deze databanken worden gevoed met APC nieuws en men kan in de tekst van de
berichten zelf zoeken met meerdere trefwoorden.

<dt>Hoe:Gebruikersondersteuning
<dd>Daar vind je alles wat te maken heeft met support: een 
aansluitingsformulier, de KnoopPunt software, handleidingen,
training en maken homepages

<dt>Waar:Bronnen
<dd>Hier vind je links naar onderwerp georienteerde informatie overzichten.
Belangrijk al je zoekt naar achtergrondinformatie

<dt>Wie:Wie is wie
<dd>Zoeken naar personen en organisaties vormt hier de hoofdmoot.
naast een wegwijzer naar de homepages van onze gebruikers. Je kan
zoeken naar telefoonnummers en internetadressen.

<dt>Wanneer:Agenda
<dd>Hier kan je agendas radplegen en/of zelf agendapunten opgeven in een
Anders Nederlandse Agendakonferentie.

<dt>???:Zoeken
<dd>Links naar zoekrobotten met uitgebreide helppagina.

OAU Calls for A Neutral Force Under United Nations
11 November 1996<BR>
From Ghion Hagos; PANA Staff Correspondent

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - A neutral force under the
United Nations should be deployed immediately to avert further
human tragedy in eastern Zaire and political turmoil in the
Great Lakes region.

<P>
This was the view expressed by Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi and OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim in their
opening statements Monday during the extraordinary ministerial
session of the OAU's organ for conflict prevention, management
and resolution.

<P>
Both Meles and Salim emphasized that the proposed neutral
force should be deployed in line with the proposals made by
the Nov. 5 regional summit in Nairobi, Kenya, details of which
had been communicated to the UN Security Council.

<P>
But the Security Council decided Nov. 6 that the cost of
mounting the operation "be borne by participating member
states and other voluntary contributors,". It also encouraged
others "to contribute to the operation in any way possible."

<P>
According to Meles, this places "constraints" on African
countries to fully participate in the force. "Since the
proposed multinational force will not strictly be a United
Nations operation but rather a force authorized and supported
by the UN, there will be need to have a clear commitment on
financial, logistics and material assistance to enable African
countries to participate," he said.

<P>
This calls for an urgent decision on the part of the United
Nations, he added, now that Africa had acted on what should be
done as specified by the decisions of the Nairobi summit.
Meles said when Africa is ready to shoulder its
responsibilities it should not be taken for granted, pointing
out that the Security Council had ignored the decisions of the
summit.

<P>
He stated that the tragedy in eastern Zaire was in more ways
than one, a sequel to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. If
Africa is to act to avert such tragedy, it should be taken
seriously by the international community.

<P>
Salim said the Nairobi summit had taken "unequivocal position"
on the inviolability and territorial integirty of Zaire.

<P>
He emphasized that an effective African participation was
pivotal to the success of the proposed neutral force in the
Great Lakes region.

<P>
As proposed by the Security Council, Salim pointed out, there
will be a need to have a clear commitment on financial
logistics and material assistance to enable African countries
to participate in the force.

Africa Seeks UN Support In Eastern Zaire
11 Nov 96 <BR>
From Ghion Hagos ; PANA Staff Correspondent

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - The United Nations Security
Council was called upon Monday to facilitate "Africa's
effective participation" in the proposed multinational force
for humanitarian work in the Great Lakes Region.

<P>
The call came at the end of a day-long extraordinary
ministerial session of the OAU body charged with conflict
prevention, management and resolution in Addis Ababa, which
deliberated on the current crisis in eastern Zaire.

<P>
In a communique, the ministers underscored the need for the
Security Council and the international community at large "to
create a mechanism" to ensure an effective African
participation in the proposed multinational force.

<P>
They said that given the resource constraints that would
clearly face African contributors to the force, "financial,
logistics and material resources should be provided on a very
reliable, dependable and sustainable basis" to ensure Africa's
effective participation.

<P>
The communique further underscored the position that "the
setting up of a neutral force, as recommended by the regional
Nairobi summit (on Nov. 5), would have been the most effective
manner in facilitating the creation of safe corridors and
temporary sanctuaries and ensuring an effective African
contribution to such a force."

<P>
However, the ministerial session regretted that the security
council "did not fully take into account this particular
recommendation of the Nairobi summit."

<P>
The meeting also appealed to all the African countries to
contribute contingents to the proposed force "on the
understanding that resources would be made available."

<P>
It pointed out "the need for clarity of the magnitude" of the
force that is to facilitate "the provision of humanitarian
relief assistance and the return of refugees to Rwanda,"
saying such a force be neutral and be deployed urgently.

<P>
The communique further said that it was crucial to separate
"intimidators from bona-fide refugees," and requested the
Security Council to consider this issue as "a vital component
of the efforts to ensure the safe and voluntary return of the
refugees to Rwanda to create conditions conducive to the
resolution of the crisis."

<P>
The meeting also expressed support to the OAU proposal for
convening, as soon as possible, an international conference on
Peace, Security and Stability in the Great Lakes Region to
find a durable solution to the crisis in the region.

<P>
OAU secretary general Salim Ahmed Salim told reporters later
that the "collective complaints of the ministers" during
deliberations had been that the multinational force proposed
by the security council had not been made fully a
responsibility of the United Nations, similar to other
previous peacekeeping forces elsewhere.

<P>
The OAU Secretary-General, Salim Ahmed Salim, told reporters
at the end of the meeting that ball was now in the court of
those that had previously said Africa should shoulder its
responsibilities.

<P>
"Africa is now ready...provided there is guarantee to ensure
the quick deployment and sustainability of the proposed
force," he declared.

<P>
He said five countries, which he did not name, have already
informed him of their readiness to contribute contingents to
the proposed multinational force, and "more have also
indicated their readiness to do so in due course."

US Relief Agencies Call for US Action on Zaire
November 8, 1996

<P>
Eighteen prominent US relief agencies today issued a statement
calling on  the US government to take immediate action before
tens of thousands of  people die in eastern Zaire.  Here is
the full text of the statement and the  agencies that support
it.  All agencies are members of InterAction, a  coalition of
U.S. relief and refugee-assistance agencies.

<P>
Alarmed by the probability that tens of thousands of refugees
in eastern  Zaire will die within days unless urgent action is
undertaken, the  undersigned agencies call on the United
States Government to take the  following immediate steps:

<OL>
  <LI> Establish at an airfield in the region a logistics
facility which can  assist with the arrival and onward
transport of personnel and supplies  needed to meet the
immediate needs of starving and sick refugees.

  <LI> Agree without further delay to work with African and
European  governments to field an international  military
force capable of providing  sufficient security to permit
refugees to be assisted in Zaire pending their  repatriation
to Rwanda or eventual resettlement. The military force also
would insure that combatants do not receive aid intended
exclusively for the  civilian population.

  <LI> Exercise leadership within the United Nations Security
Council to see  that the Council makes clear to the
governments of the region that any  interference with
humanitarian relief operations will alienate them from  their
friends in the international community.

</OL>
<P>
This crisis in the Great Lakes region has erupted due to the
failure for  over two years of the international community to
muster the  political will  necessary to address  the
underlying causes of instability in the region. As  the most
powerful and influential member of the international
community, the  United States government must commit itself to
playing a leadership role in  the resolution of this crisis,
as it takes immediate steps to limit loss of  life.

Human Rights Watch/Africa Calls for Protection of Refugees in
Eastern Zaire

<P>
(New York, November 7, 1996)--Human Rights Watch/Africa today
called upon the international community to guarantee
protection to the refugees in eastern Zaire. The human rights
organization stated that to coerce them to return to unsafe
situations in their home countries amounts to refoulement,
which is a clear violation of international refugee law. "The
international community cannot solve the humanitarian crisis
in eastern Zaire by sacrificing the basic rights of refugees
to avoid being forcibly returned to countries where they have
cause to fear persecution," according to Peter Takirambudde,
Executive Director of Human Rights Watch/Africa. "At the same
time, those persons suspected of involvement in the 1994
genocide in Rwanda as well as those now engaged in armed
attacks against Rwanda and Burundi must be excluded from the
protection afforded to legitimate refugees."

<P>
Donor governments, the UNHCR, and some aid organizations hope
that the current desperate conditions in Zaire will drive most
refugees to return, thus ending the problem of the refugee
camps. The camps have been a source of insecurity because the
former Rwandan army and militia have used them as bases from
which to launch armed incursions into Rwanda. Those
responsible for the genocide continue to control the camps,
spurring hopes for a return to Rwanda by force and using
terror and intimidation to discourage voluntary repatriation.
One of the strategies currently being proposed by the United
States and the UNHCR is to provide food and medical services
within the refugees' home countries so as to attract the
refugees back. While repatriation is an appropriate option for
some of the refugees, it must be a voluntary process. Although
migrants can be forcibly returned to their home countries,
international law prohibits forcibly returning genuine
refugees. Many of those who fled Rwanda and Burundi have
legitimate grounds to fear persecution, given the
nonfunctioning judicial systems and continuing military
attacks on civilians, as described below. Given this, and in
the absence of screening procedures to determine which of the
migrants formally qualify as refugees, the presumption must be
that all are refugees -- that is, that no forcible return is
permitted.

<P>
Positive steps by Rwanda and Burundi to improve respect for
human rights and ensure that the killing of civilians stops
and that those responsible for past and present killings of
civilians are investigated, tried with full respect for due
process, and punished would certainly persuade more refugees
to return voluntarily. Assurances that the international
community would provide long-term monitoring of their
situations should they return would also increase the
likelihood of substantial numbers of people returning of their
own volition.

<P>
Those suspected of genocide and crimes against humanity, like
those involved in military activity against the governments of
the home countries, have no right to the status of refugee and
should be excluded from such status. Despite the difficulties
in identifying the killers, mechanisms must be put in place to
screen out those suspected of genocide from genuine refugees.

<P>
There are thousands of legitimate refugees in Zaire and many
of them fear returning to Rwanda or Burundi because of
insecurity: assassinations, disappearances, and attacks by
military or militia on civilians. Those slaughtered by the
Burundian army and militia affiliated with it number in the
thousands this year, while some 600 civilians have been killed
this year by Rwandan soldiers. In general, military
authorities in Rwanda and Burundi refuse to acknowledge abuses
on the part of their soldiers, often falsely asserting that
the civilians were in fact infiltrators or their accomplices
or that they were accidentally slain in an exchange of fire
with infiltrators. In a rare and welcome departure from this
policy, in late October a military officer in Burundi admitted
that soldiers in the southern province of Bururi had massacred
some fifty civilians and said that soldiers responsible would
be punished.

<P>
Refugees also fear arbitrary arrest to be followed by an
apparently limitless period of detention without trial -- as
is the case in Rwanda, where 83,000 languish in inhumane
conditions -- or by trial under conditions that fail to meet
international standards of justice, as was recently the case
in Burundi, where eighty-nine persons were sentenced to death
and thirty-nine to life imprisonment without having had access
to defense counsel. Initially lacking both the money and the
personnel needed to begin trials, the Rwandan government is
now adequately supplied with the necessary resources to start
proceedings. A law adopted on September 1 divides perpetrators
of genocide into different categories and assigns punishments
for each. The government is conducting an information campaign
to inform prisoners of the details of the law and to give them
opportunities to confess, in return for which some may receive
reduced sentences. This procedure should finish by the end of
the year and the Rwandan government should be ready to begin
trials by early January at the latest. Implementing the
genocide law in a manner that ensures trials or release for
all detainees within a reasonable time is essential to avoid
creating legitimate fears of arbitrary detention among
refugees.

<P>
In order to guard against arbitrary detention based on false
or unsupported allegations of complicity in the genocide, the
Rwandan government should establish prompt judicial review of
all detentions. In addition, to assure that those detained
face trial within the near future, the government should
announce the date when the trials of those accused of genocide
will begin, and provide concrete information about the
proceedings and provisions being made for defense counsel. To
address the refugees' fears of attacks by the Rwandan military
once they return to their home communes, the government must
acknowledge and condemn killings by the military and begin
investigation and prosecution of those responsible. Since the
military courts are functioning, these trials should begin
immediately.

<P>
Many Rwandan refugees also fear that they will have no home or
no fields to plant if they return; they fear that if they find
their property occupied and attempt to regain it, they may be
imprisoned on false charges of genocide. Soon after the
establishment of the current government, it set up property
commissions to resolve conflicts between returned refugees and
squatters who had occupied their property, but such
commissions have been unable to resolve most such disputes.
The Rwandan government should increase the resources and
authority of such commissions so that they are able to
guarantee the rights of the returned refugees.

<P>
To help ensure the security of those who return, the
international community must commit itself to engage in
long-term monitoring of refugees in their home communes. The
most appropriate mechanism available to conduct such
monitoring would be the United Nations Human Rights Field
Operation in Rwanda, which has a mandate "to monitor the
ongoing human rights situation, and through their presence
help redress existing problems and prevent possible human
rights violations from occurring." Deploying the additional
human rights officers needed to monitor the return of the
refugees will require significant new resources, but this cost
is far less than what would be needed to provide continuing
assistance for people too fearful of persecution to return
home.

<P>
Those legitimate refugees who choose to remain in Zaire,
however, must not be deprived of the essentials of life in
order to force them to repatriate; to engage in a program of
selective feeding and offer them food only if they return to
Rwanda would be the equivalent of refoulement, a practice
prohibited by international refugee law. The international
community did nothing to stop Burundi from forcibly returning
some 80,000 refugees to Rwanda in July and August. Those
refugees have been generally well-received in Rwanda, but
their relatively trouble-free return does not excuse the
practice or make it acceptable as a model for the current
situation. Nor does it eliminate grounds for fear among the
refugees now in Zaire. In the absence of the establishment of
the rule of law through a denunciation of arbitrary killing,
the investigation and prosecution of those responsible, and
the creation of a mechanism to avoid arbitrary detention,
there is nothing to prevent the Rwandan authorities from
persecuting returning refugees.

<P>
In delivering assistance to those who decide to stay in Zaire,
the UNHCR and aid organizations must exclude those suspected
of genocide or crimes against humanity and those involved in
military activity against their home governments. Despite the
inherent difficulties in identifying the killers and
conducting effective screening, the international community
should seize the opportunity provided by the movement of large
numbers of the refugees and the possibility that international
troops might be deployed in the region to attempt to separate
the killers from the general refugee population. Those
indicted by international or national courts, and those who
held command responsibility in either the civilian or military
structures of the former Rwandan government or in the militia
should not receive aid and they must not be able to take
control again of refugee camps. At a minimum, arms should not
be permitted in any camp where humanitarian aid is going to be
provided. If new camps are established, they should be located
a sufficient distance away from the international borders to
prevent them posing a threat to neighboring countries.

<P>
The international community has thus far failed in its
obligation to bring to justice persons charged with genocide.
It was slow in providing the needed resources for the
International Tribunal for Rwanda to begin its work. It has
allowed Cameroon to delay for months in delivering Col.
Theonest Bagosora, the most important leader indicted, to the
custody of the Tribunal in Arusha. It has done nothing about
establishing an international tribunal to investigate and try
cases of genocide and crimes against humanity in Burundi,
although the United Nations Commission of Inquiry found that
acts of genocide had been committed there. The international
community, including neighboring states, must be reminded of
the importance of cooperating with the Tribunal.

<P>
If the UNHCR, donor governments, and aid organizations
determine that an armed force is necessary to permit delivery
of humanitarian assistance, such a force must include the
protection of human rights in its mandate. At the very least,
any such force must have the authority to locate and detain
persons suspected of leading the genocide in order to deliver
them to the International Tribunal or national courts. The
lesson of UNPROFOR in Bosnia clearly demonstrates the futility
of an international force with a mandate only to feed people
but not to protect them from violence. Thus, if a force is
deployed, it should be mandated and adequately equipped to
protect and promote human rights within its zone, including
protecting the civilians from attack.

<P>
The international community has not taken seriously its
efforts to control the flow of arms to this region. Although
the UN established a commission to investigate allegations
that arms were being delivered to the forces of the former
Rwandan government in violation of a UN arms embargo, it has
done nothing to act on the findings of the commission. In
fact, the Security Council is currently deciding whether or
not to release the commission's report, which deals with arms
transfers as well as issues directly relating to the genocide
and the current crisis.

<P>
The presence of former Rwandan soldiers and militia in eastern
Zaire has exacerbated pre-existing hostility against Zairians
ethnically related to the Tutsi of Rwanda and Burundi. Former
Rwandan soldiers and militia reportedly joined in attacks on
Zairian Tutsi in North Kivu six months ago as well as in more
recent attacks on the Banyamulenge of South Kivu. The actions
of the Zairian parliament in declaring that Tutsi should be
removed from government employment, the statement of the
Deputy Governor of South Kivu that all Tutsi must leave within
one week or face attack, and the participation of Zairian
military in attacks on Tutsi or their failure to stop such
violence by civilians have created fears that the government
will permit or itself engage in large-scale killings of Tutsi.
Bands of civilians, sometimes with official support, have
already driven Tutsi from their homes and pillaged their
property in Kinshasa as well as in eastern Zaire. Zairian
political leaders and interest groups maintain that the people
attacked are transplanted Rwandans, although they were born in
Zaire and some of them descend from families that have lived
there for centuries. The government of Zaire must recognize
the right to nationality and must cease denationalizing
Banyamulenge and other people ethnically related to Tutsi who
qualify for Zairian citizenship. The government of Zaire is
responsible for the safety of all civilians within its
borders, regardless of their citizenship, and must take
measures to ensure that military and civilian authorities
provide such protection.

<P>
Recommendations:

<P>
To the Security Council, UNHCR, international donor countries
and international aid agencies:

<OL>
  <LI> Guarantee the right of legitimate refugees to protection
from forcible repatriation and ensure that humanitarian
supplies are provided in Zaire for those legitimate refugees
who decide not to return to their home countries.

  <LI> Institute screening procedures in Zaire to exclude from
refugee status those suspected of genocide or crimes against
humanity and armed combatants. At a minimum, prohibit arms
from any camp where humanitarian assistance is being provided.

  <LI> Publish immediately the UN Commission of Inquiry's report
on arms flows, and undertake to act on its conclusions.

  <LI> Put pressure on the governments of Rwanda and Burundi to
ensure that returning refugees are protected from killing,
arbitrary arrest, and harassment. Work with these governments
to see that immediate steps are taken to encourage voluntary
repatriation.

  <LI> Pressure the government of Rwanda to begin trials of those
accused of genocide by the first of the year.

  <LI> Pressure the government of Burundi to institute immediate
reforms of its judicial system to comply with international
standards of due process and fairness.

  <LI> Pressure the governments of Rwanda and Burundi to bring to
trial those soldiers responsible for serious human rights
abuses.

  <LI> Ensure that if camps are re-opened, that they be situated
a reasonable distance from the Rwandan and Burundian borders.

</OL>
<P>
To the Zairian government:

<OL>
  <LI> The government of Zaire should officially restore the
citizenship of the Banyamulenge and other persons said to be
"Tutsi" who qualified for citizenship prior to the 1981 law.

  <LI> Zairian civilian and military authorities from the highest
levels down must acknowledge and condemn all attacks against
civilians. Zairian soldiers and civilians responsible for
attacks and looting throughout Zaire, as well as all those
responsible for attacks against Tutsi throughout the country,
should be investigated and brought to justice.

  <LI> The government should institute reforms of the judicial
system to comply with international standards of due process
and fairness.

</OL>
<P>
To the United Nations:

<OL>
  <LI> Publish immediately the UN Commission of Inquiry's report
on arms flows, and undertake to act on its conclusions.

  <LI> Provide additional human and material resources for the UN
Human Rights Field Operations in Rwanda and Burundi, so they
are able to conduct long-term monitoring of the situation of
returning refugees.

  <LI> Create an ad hoc tribunal to try genocide and crimes
against humanity in Burundi, since it is highly unlikely that
domestic courts would conduct fair trails for those
individuals on both sides who have been responsible for gross
human rights abuses. Because the continuing conflict in
Burundi results in large part from mutual fear between the
majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi, prosecutions are
especially important as a way to eradicate impunity and end
the cycles of violence that have plagued Burundi for so many
years.

<h3>Title: ZAIRE-RWANDA: Arms Sales to Hutu Rebels Went On in 1996</h3>

<P>
by Farhan Haq

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, Nov 8 (IPS) - More than a dozen countries played a
part in the re-arming of Rwandan rebels who were based in refugee
camps in eastern Zaire until last week, a confidential U.N. report
contends.

<P>
The report, prepared by a four-member commission led by
Ambassador Mahmoud Kassem of Egypt, argues that countries ranging
from South Africa to many Eastern European nations transported
arms this year to the rebels, accused of genocidal massacres in
1994.

<P>
The ethnic Hutu rebels, formerly Rwanda's government forces
(RGF) until they were ousted and fled mainly to neighbouring Zaire
and Tanzania, are forbidden under a U.N. arms embargo from
receiving the weapons they have continued to receive, the
commission warned.

<P>
The arms build-up by the rebels in eastern Zaire prompted the
Rwandan government last week to aid the advances of Zaire's
Banyamulenge rebels, who seized the major refugee centres of Goma,
Bukavu, and Uvira over the past two weeks. The RGF and Rwandan
refugees have since fled deep into Zaire, as well as to
neighbouring African countries.

<P>
''According to the commission's informants, arms have continued
to flow to the former Rwandan government forces, often from or
through South Africa, Angola, Eastern Europe, and the former
Yugoslavia, and Kinshasa, Zaire,'' the report states.

<P>
''Rather than landing at the relatively large airports of Goma
and Bukavu, as was reported durinhe 1994-1995 period, these
arms are now flown into small airstrips, possibly including Bunia
near Lake Albert, some 300 kms north of Goma,'' it adds.

<P>
Among the countries named in the report as possible suppliers
of arms are such former RGF allies as Egypt and France, both of
which supported former Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, an
RGF leader who died in an unsolved 1994 plane crash that sparked
the massacres. Perhaps one million Rwandans were killed, mainly by
the RGF and Hutu militias, according to the United Nations.

<P>
An airplane en route from Bulgaria, with registration number
UR76539, landed in Egypt carrying some 30 tonnes of arms this past
June, the Kassem commission noted.

<P>
It then travelled to Kinshasa, the Zairean capital, where ''the
arms could have been destined for the former Rwandan government
forces in violation of the U.N. arms embargo,'' the report says.
Egypt has not responded to the charges, it adds.

<P>
Similarly, France, a former RGF ally and strong supporter of
ailing Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, may have dispatched a
French national to meet with the RGF's former chief of staff, Gen.
Augustin Bizimungu, in the Zairean town of Mugunga recently.
France denies the report, and says no French official has met any
RGF representative.

<P>
Other countries also may have played a role in the RGF's rearming, 
including Italy, the manufacturer of anti-personnel
landmines used by the Rwandan forces based in Zaire; and the Czech
Republic and Zambia, both of which are alleged to have supplied
arms to Goma. The commission is still awaiting replies from most
of the accused nations.

<P>
The main country suspected of aiding the rebels, however, is
the RGF's host, Zaire. Human Rights Watch accused Mobutu's
government of helping to ferry arms to the RGF in a 1995 report,
and the Kassem commission added that the Zaireans have allowed
Ndolo Airport at Kinshasa to serve as ''a kind of hub for weapons
shipments'' for the Hutus.

<P>
''In view of the continuing allegations of Zairean involvement
in the illegal supply of arms to the ex-RGF, the commission has
repeatedly tried to obtain from the Zairean government information
about these allegations and permission to resume its
investigations in and around Goma,'' the report says. ''Its
efforts have been fruitless.''

<P>
Burundian rebels based in eastern Zaire, also mainly Hutus who
oppose that country's Tutsi military regime, have also siphoned
off some of the arms trade, although they are not prohibited from
receiving arms by a U.N. embargo, the commission noted.

<P>
Both the Rwandan and Burundian groups were routed from the
provinces of North and South Kivu by the Banyamulenge, ethnic
Tutsi Zaireans who were threatened with expulsion by the
provincial governors in September.

<P>
Zaire has blamed the attacks, which led to a speedy retreat by
its armed forces, on Rwandan interference; Rwanda has claimed its
only involvement was in self-defence following Zairean and RGF
raids on its borders.

<P>
In its report, written as the fighting in North and South Kivu
spread, the Kassem commission recommended that the United Nations
send observers to the region to monitor arms traffic there. The
U.N. Security Council is currently considering several options,
including approval for an international peacekeeping force
supported by, and including, France. (end/ips/fah/yjc/96)

<h3>ARMS ALLEGEDLY SENT TO HUTUS</h3>

<p>Rwanda Vice-President and Defence Minister Paul Kagame alleged that arms 
were being shipped from Belgium to Rwandan Hutu refugees in Zaire.  US group 
Human Rights Watch - Africa claimed the Hutus had rebuilt a force of 50,000 
soldiers with arms and other assistance provided by Zaire, France and to a 
lesser extent South Africa, the Seychelles and China.  France and South 
Africa were said to be continuing to ship arms to the Hutus, now using 
middlemen, while the Hutus also received strong support from figures in the 
Zairean military.  South African government and industry representatives 
denied the allegations, saying arms had not been supplied since 1993. France 
categorically denied allegations it illegally supplied arms or military 
training to the Rwandan Hutus.

&gt;British Company Shipped Arms as Genocide Went On, Documents Show
&gt;<BR>
&gt;November 18, 1996 - 3:32 p.m. EST<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;GOMA, Zaire (AP) -- A British-based company supplied arms and ammunition to
the former Rwandan government after it began slaughtering a half-million of
its own people in 1994, according to documents that Hutu militias left
behind when they retreated in eastern Zaire.
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The documents, made available to The Associated Press on Monday, indicated
the Rwandan government bought more than $5.5 million worth of machine guns,
mortars, grenades, ammunition and other military hardware from the company,
Mil-Tec Corp., between April and July 1994.
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Some shipments appeared to contravene a U.N. embargo on exporting arms to
Rwanda, imposed in May 1994 following acts of genocide by the former
Hutu-led government against minority Tutsis and 
&gt;moderate Hutus.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;A U.N. Commission of Inquiry has been investigating a British company for
allegedly supplying arms to the ex-Hutu government or its militia allies
after they fled to Zaire, it was reported  earlier this month. It could not
be learned whether Mil-Tec is that company.
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The continued arms trade in the volatile region has drawn sharp protests
from international human rights groups, which allege that the French
government also supplied weapons to the retreating Hutus 
&gt;after the 1994 genocide. France denies it.
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Public pressure led the South African government on Nov. 6 to announce it
was suspending arms shipments to the new, Tutsi-led Rwandan government.
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The documents were found in a bus, part of a wrecked convoy abandoned by
retreating Hutu militias in Sake, 18 miles west of Goma. The Hutu militias,
remnants of the former Rwandan army that fled Tutsi 
&gt;forces in 1994, were fleeing from Zairian rebel troops sweeping through
eastern Zaire.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The documents indicated Mil-Tec is based in Douglas, the Isle of Man, off
England's northwest coast, and in Hove, 50 miles south of London. But it is
not listed in telephone directories and could not 
&gt;be reached for comment. <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The arms were flown out of London's Heathrow Airport; Tel Aviv, Israel; and
Tirana, Albania, via such carriers as Belgium's Sabena, Germany's Lufthansa
and Russia's Aeroflot, according to the 
&gt;documents.

<P>
&gt;They were delivered to the Rwandan capital, Kigali, and then later - when
government forces fled into neighboring Zaire - flown to Goma and Kinshasa,
the Zairian capital. Payments were made through 
&gt;Belgium, France and Egypt, the documents said.
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The documents included demands by Mil-Tec to the Rwandan government for
overdue payment of $1.9 million. ``We have been suppliers to your ministry
for over five years and were able to assist  you with supplies during your
time of need,'' one document said.

<P>
It added that Mil-Tec was ``approached for very urgent supplies'' on April
10, 1994 - four days after the massacres began in Rwanda. Mil-Tec made that
delivery within eight days, the document said.

<P>
&gt;Many victims of the slaughter were killed by machetes and other simple
weapons, but others were killed by guns and grenades.

<P>
The massacres went on into June 1994, and the abandoned documents indicated
Mil-Tec arms shipments continued until July 13. They included several
million rounds of ammunition, thousands of machine 
&gt;guns and more than 15,000 mortar rounds and grenades.
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Britain's Customs and Excise office said Monday it had investigated
allegations of British traders dealing with Rwandan groups, and had found no
evidence of violations. It said it would investigate further if evidence
were presented.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;When shipping to embargoed destinations, arms dealers sometimes use
fraudulent ``end user'' documentation purporting that the arms are headed
elsewhere. British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo said he didn't know
about the shipments. ``We want to make sure that some of the most evil
people in the world don't get hold of weapons that have anything to do with
Britain,'' Portillo said on BBC radio.

Title: ZAIRE-POLITICS: Rebels Vow To Go All The Way To Kinshasa

<P>
By Jean Baptiste Kayigamba

<P>
MUDENDE, RWANDA, Nov 8 (IPS) - Rebels fighting in Eastern Zaire
Nov 8 (IPS) - Rebels fighting in Eastern Zaire
have vowed to take their struggle all the way to Kinshasa to
topple the government of President Mobutu Sese Seko.

<P>
With three key towns in the eastern province of Kivu - Uvira,
Bukavu, and Goma in rebel hands - and Zairean politicians
bickering over the army's losses, the Alliance of Democratic
Forces for Liberation (Congo-Zaire) (ADFL) said the time was ripe
for them to topple the three-decades-old regime.

<P>
The ADFL is an umbrella rebel organisation that is spearheading
the rebellion in the North and South Kivu Provinces.

<P>
''We have decided to take the struggle to Kinshasa, passing
through Gbadolite -- the residential town of Mobutu,'' rebel
commander Douglas Bugera of the Peoples' Democratic Alliance (DPA)
declared on 'Radio Star' based in Goma, and monitored in the
Rwandan border town of Gisenyi.

<P>
The DPA is one of the rebel movements which merged into the ADFL.
Others are the National Council of Resistance for Democracy
(NCRD), the Revolutionary Movement for the Liberation of Zaire
(RMLZ), and the Peoples' Democratic Alliance (PDA).

<P>
''Our struggle started with Lumumba,'' Bugera explained. The late
Patrice Lumumba led the struggle for Zaire's independence from
Belgium and was the country's first Prime Minister.

<P>
Bugera discarded the allegations that the rebels were supported
by Rwanda and Burundi saying: ''Now, we have enough power and the
right opportunity.''

<P>
The ADFL has appointed Laurent Desire Kabila, a veteran of the
secessionist wars that have rocked Zaire since independence in
1960, as its spokesman.

<P>
His political career began with the rebels led by Pierre Mulele
who seized much of Zaire in 1964 before being crushed a year later
by Mobutu with help from some Western powers - notably France,
Belgium and the United States.

<P>
According to a protocol of agreement signed by the ADLF
commanders, there is ''... an urgent need to bring about a deep
change to the present day conditions experienced by the whole
nation''.

<P>
The rebels blame the Mobutu regime for the disorderliness of
institutions, the collapse of the state and its inability to
restore public order and for ''the continuing impoverishment of
the population contrasting with the scandalous enrichment of a
minority of predators and looters of the national wealth.''

<P>
They charge that Mobutu's regime has wrecked Zaire's economy: in
the 1970s, for example, it nationalised some 1,500 foreign
companies, but these soon went bankrupt.

<P>
Zairean refugees interviewed in Mudende, in the Gisenyi District
near the border with Zaire, claimed not to know the ADFL rebels
very well. But some agreed that ''change is necessary''.

<P>
''Now we understand that all the woes and mistreatment we have
experienced were to blame on bad leadership,'' confided one young
man. ''If these (rebels) have come to liberate us, we have no
problem to join the struggle.''

<P>
About 5,000 Zairean refugees arrived in this area some two weeks
ago following the fighting and the capturing of towns by the
rebels in eastern Zaire.

<P>
Kabila is reportedly urging people to join the rebels' struggle
to topple the regime. In the Kivu provincial capital of Bukavu on
Thursday, Kabila galvanised a throng of more than 50,000 people.

<P>
Deo Ntarugera, a political analyst from Masisi Zone in Kivu,
now living in Kigali, said that the rebels' were advancing in
their goal to defeat the Zairean forces.

<P>
''What we have here is a rebel force that has proven superior to
the regular army, which today is demoralised with virtually no
motivation,'' he told IPS. ''This (the Zairean army) is an army of
looters who have only survived by pillaging the population because
they are not paid.'' (end/ips/jbk/pm96)

Pour mieux comprendre le conflit a l'Est du Zaire

<P>
Alors que la communaute internationale s'avoue impuissante a
empecher un deuxieme drame humanitaire aux frontieres du Rwanda et
abandonne a nouveau a son sort le million et demi de refugies
rwandais et burundais qui sont maintenant rejoints par des dizaines de
milliers de Zairois fuyant les combats; alors que cette meme
communaute internationale s'apprete pour une deuxieme fois, a
organiser, a grands frais, une operation d'urgence humanitaire
d'envergure et deploie une nouvelle ronde diplomatique pour, en
premier lieu, en assurer la securite,la Table de concertation sur les
droits humains au Zaire voudrait<BR>
attirer l'attention sur les points suivants:

<P>
Le conflit qui se deroule actuellement au Kivu deborde largement
des raisons invoquees initialement, et repercutees naivement par
les medias, a savoir la revendication par une population zairoise, les
Banyamulenge, de leur citoyennete zairoise. Nous assistons plutot aux
manoeuvres du regime de Kigali pour regler, a sa maniere, l'epineux
probleme de la presence menacante d'un million de refugies a ses
frontieres; pour ce faire, il tire profit de la desorganisation
generalisee au Zaire et beneficie de l'aide d'autres Etats dont le
Burundi ainsi que de l'accord tacite de lacommunaute internationale.
Chacune des parties impliquees tente maintenant de tirer profit de la
crise au mepris de la vie de milliers de refugies rwandais et
burundais et de deplaces zairois.


<P>
Au debut octobre, une troupe bien armee de soi-disant Banyamulenge en
provenance du Rwanda, gagnait les hauts plateaux d'Uvira, Fizi, et
Mwenga, terre d'origine des Banyamulenge. Ils affirmaient vouloir se
defendre contre les exactions dont leur communaute etait victime. Mais
cet objectif a ete rapidement depasse : les camps de refugies
burundais et rwandais des environs d'Uvira ont ete attaques et vides
de leurs occupants, et les garnisons des Forces armees zairoises (FAZ)
ont ete prises jusqu'a Bukavu pourtant bien eloigne du territoire
traditionnel des Banyamulenge. Au meme moment, les camps de refugies
rwandais au Nord-Kivu etaient bombardes par de soi-disant Banyarwanda
voulant regagner leur terre d'ou ils avaient ete chasses l'ete
dernier.

<P>
L'operation militaire en cours, de par son envergure et les cibles
visees, ne peut etre le fait de groupes restreints aussi motives
soient-ils.  Elle ne peut s'expliquer que par l'implication directede
l'armee rwandaise. Sous le couvert de defendre la cause des
Banyamulenge, Kigali, soutenu par le Burundi, a entrepris de
poursuivre ses propres objectifs : refouler tous les refugies loin de
ses frontieres et casser les bases des rebelles qui menaient
desincursions meurtrieres dans chacun des pays. Ces groupes rebelles
sont les militaires de l'ancien regime et les miliciens
Interahamwepour le Rwanda, et les partisans du Conseil national de
defense de la democratie (CNDD), pour le Burundi. Le Haut commissariat
auxrefugies (HCR) n'a pas reussi a convaincre le Zaire ou une force
militaire internationale de desarmer les ex-militaires rwandais et
d'isoler, pour les remettre a la justice, les responsables des
actes de genocide de 1994; depuis, ils empechent le retour des
refugies innocents. Cette impuissance avouee a donne a Kigali
l'argument necessaire a sa derniere intervention.

<P>
Il faut se rappeler que cette entreprise survient a peine quelques
jours apres une reunion du comite executif du HCR; les delegues y
avaient constate l'echec de leurs tentatives de reglement du probleme
des camps au Sud et au Nord-Kivu, qualifies de bourbier mortel
d'interet politique et de securite=AF. Le HCR declarait alors que la
situation ne pouvait plus durer et que la communaute internationale
devait prendre des risques pour definir une strategie coordonnee pour
un retour rapide, dans l'ordre et<BR>
volontaire des refugies rwandais.... Cette nouvelle strategie
devait sans doute s'inspirer de l'exemple du reglement burundais du
probleme des refugies. En effet, fin juillet, les 67 000 refugies
rwandais au Burundi avaient ete fortement incites par l'armee
burundaise a rentrer chez eux, a la grande satisfaction du HCR. Le
consensus international quant a un reglement rapide et plus directif
du probleme des refugies au Zaire a sans doute pousse Kigali a
s'attaquer aux camps.

<P>
Les evenements tragiques qui se deroulent actuellement a l'Est du
Zaire devraient, selon le HCR, etre propices a un mouvement de
retour massif. D'ou les appels repetes, repercutes sur les ondes
des radios locales, pour que les refugies regagnent le Rwanda. Et
le HCR de deplorer, une fois encore, que des milliers de fuyards
choisissent les conditions inhumaines de leur exil plutot que le
retour. Comment s'en surprendre quand les attaques meurtrieres et
les bombes qui devastent les camps partent de la ou on les appelle;
quand leur securite est loin d'etre assuree; quand continuent de
croupir en prison quelques 80 000 personnes en attente de proces!
Kigali veut-il vraiment le retour du million et demi de refugies? Pour
l'heure, la question reste posee. En aurait-il seulement les capacites
materielles comme l'affirment aujourd'hui les representants des
Etat-Unis?

<P>
Par ailleurs, les declarations du president rwandais, Pasteur
Bizimungu, selon lesquelles les frontieres definies par les
puissances coloniales pourraient etre revues, devoileraient-elles
un autre objectif au conflit actuel? Celui d'incorporer au
territoire rwandais les zones d'habitation banyamulenge au Sud et
celles des Banyarwanda au Nord-Kivu accreditant ainsi les
accusations des parlementaires zairois selon lesquelles le Rwanda
cherche a instituer un nouveau royaume tutsi?

<P>
L'etat de desorganisation militaire, economique et politique du
Zaire, laisse malheureusement place a toutes les derives. La crise
actuelle est aussi le resultat de l'absence d'un Etat de droit au
Zaire. La question de la nationalite des ressortissants
rwandophones de l'Est du pays, constamment niee depuis 15 ans, n'a
jamais ete traitee avec le serieux necessaire par la classe
politique de Kinshasa. Au contraire, on a laisse les politiciens de la
region, pour leurs seules fins personnelles, monter les
populations locales contre eux et attiser les haines tribales. En
outre, Kinshasa qui n'a jamais cache ses sympathies pour les
dirigeants de l'ancien regime rwandais, n'a pas voulu desarmer les
militaires ni les miliciens et leur a laisse le controle des camps.
Alors que la communaute internationale, malgre une agitation tardive
pour tenter de sauver a nouveau des milliers de refugies et de
deplaces, se prepare a adopter une politique du fait accompli, alors
que le Zaire, quant a lui, s'apprete a organiser une contre-offensive
que certains voudraient voir mener jusqu'a Kigali, il importe de
rappeler certaines pistes de solution avancees depuis longtemps deja
qu'on devrait necessairement appliquer dans le respect des frontieres
actuelles:

<UL>
  <LI> les refugies rwandais et burundais doivent regagner leur pays
respectif; ils le feront quand des conditions minimales de securite
seront garanties. Parmi celles-ci, l'etablissement d'un systeme de
justice nationale equitable, et la poursuite au niveau
international, des responsables du genocide et des crimes de guerre
pour le Rwanda, des responsables du putsch et des actes de genocide de
1993, pour le Burundi. Le debut d'une solution devrait passer par des
negociations entre les regimes en place et des representants des
refugies de meme que par l'assurance d'une
presence internationale adequate pour superviser leur retour.

  <LI> Le Zaire doit reconnaitre la nationalite zairoise a ses
populations rwandophones de l'Est du pays; nier ce droit constitue une
violation du droit international de meme que de la Convention pour la
reduction des cas d'apatride de 1961, comme le rappelait le Rapporteur
special sur le Zaire de la Commission des droits de l'homme des
Nations Unies en janvier dernier. Cependant, a cause du deplacement
continu des Rwandais et des Burundais de part et d'autre de frontieres
tres permeables, au rythme des crises qui ont secoue ces pays depuis
30 ans, une operation d'identification devrait avoir lieu pour
departager nationaux, refugies anciens et nouveaux et immigrants
illegaux. De plus, il faut exiger que les militaires zairois,
veritables plaies pour les populations civiles, s'engagent a respecter
les droits les plus elementaires de leurs concitoyens. Enfin, les
autorites a tous les niveaux, devraient lutter contre tout recours a
la haine tribale; le Zaire, n'a que trop paye dans son passe lointain
et recent, pour ces luttes fratricides.

  <LI> La proliferation des armes dans toute la region a ete denoncee
depuis plusieurs annees deja sans qu'aucune mesure internationale
efficace n'ait ete envisagee pour contrer la menace qu'elle
constitue. Il n'est pas inutile de rappeler que la levee de
l'embargo sur les armes a l'encontre du Rwanda par le Conseil de
securite l'ete dernier, coincide etrangement avec l'eclatement de
cette nouvelle crise. Maintenant que sont connues les conclusions
du Rapport d'enquete internationale sur la circulation des armes
dans la region des Grands Lacs, depose la semaine derniere au
Conseil de securite, les pays fournisseurs d'armes devraient etre
pointes du doigt et assumer leur part de responsabilite dans le
drame actuel. L'embargo sur les armes, decrete depuis 1994 contre
les forces militaires de l'ancien regime rwandais devrait etre
serieusement applique et envisage pour les Etats de la region qui
contribuent a aggraver la crise actuelle.

  <LI> Enfin, aucun des trois pays impliques dans la presente crise n'a de
gouvernement legitimement elu; il faudra eviter a tout prix que le
conflit en cours ne serve de pretexte aux actuels tenants du pouvoir
pour reporter indefiniment la mise en place d'institutions
democratiques.

La Table de concertation sur les droits humains au Zaire regroupe
depuis 1988, a Montreal, des missionnaires, des representants
d'organismes de cooperation internationale et de groupes de
solidarite ainsi que des personnalites zairoises qui soutiennent
les populations du Zaire dans leurs luttes pour le respect des
droits et la democratie. Depuis 1992, elle publie un feuillet
d'information specialise : Info-Zaire.

                        ZAIRE - Complex Emergency

Fact Sheet # 1, FY 1997                          November 8, 1996
</PRE>

<P>
BACKGROUND: The Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda people, who are
Tutsi of Rwandan origin, settled in the Mulenge hills of South
Kivu, Zaire and the Masisi region of North Kivu, Zaire more than
200 years ago. Sporadic ethnic violence in the Masisi region has
occurred since 1959, but it again escalated in the fall of 1995
as members of the former Rwandan army (the ex-FAR) and the Hutu
militia (the Interahamwe) targeted Banyarwanda Tutsi in an
apparent attempt to create an area of Hutu control in the region.
In September 1996, the situation in the Uvira region of South
Kivu, Zaire began to resemble that in the Masisi region.  A rural
development organization which had lobbied for recognition of
Banyamulenge nationality rights was banned in August 1996, and in
September indigenous Zairians organized strikes against the
Banyamulenge and attacks against their homes and property.  On
October 8, 1996, the South Kivu Deputy Governor declared that
Banyamulenge residents were to leave the area within seven days
or be treated as rebels.  On October 14, fighting broke out
between the Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairian Army (FAZ) near
Runingo refugee camp.  From October 14 to November 4, the
two-pronged fighting spread, moving  up the eastern border of
Zaire from Uvira, South Kivu to Bukavu, as well as south from
Rutshuru, North Kivu to Goma.  The fighting displaced up to one
million Rwandan and Burundian refugees and Zairians.  On
November 4, the Banyamulenge rebels declared a unilateral
three-week ceasefire to allow refugees to return home.

<P>
<STRONG>CURRENT HUMANITARIAN SITUATION</STRONG><BR>
GOMA:  On October 26, Kibumba camp north of Goma was shelled.
This caused the camp's 195,000 Rwandan refugees to move south to
Mugunga camp, thereby increasing its population to an estimated
420,000 people.  On October 29, CARE Australia and the Zairian
Red Cross distributed World Food Programme (WFP) food to 350,000
refugees at Mugunga camp and 50,000 refugees at Lac Vert camp.
Roughly 10,000 displaced Zairians were also assisted in the
distribution.  Zairian staff of WFP distributed remaining
foodstocks to Kahindo camp's 115,000 refugees and Katale camp's
210,000 refugees on October 28.   As fighting intensified and the
rebels gained control of the Goma airport and region, refugees
emptied from the Katale, Kahindo, and Lac Vert camps, and
Zairians fled Goma town.  All expatriate humanitarian relief
workers were evacuated from Goma  on November 2; therefore, the
international community does not have a good sense of where the
refugees and displaced are moving.  Most reports indicate that
there currently is movement west of Goma in search of water.
Members of the local population in Goma reported on November 7
that disease is rampant and people are dying in large numbers.

<P>
BUKAVU:   On October 30, as the fighting between the FAZ and the
Banyamulenge rebels spread north from Uvira, 40,000 refugees from
the southern Bukavu camps and 20,000 Zairians from Bukavu town
fled the area, moving west and north.  The Banyamulenge now
control the town and its airport.  The rebels reported on
November 5 that the city is calm and that thousands of Zairian
residents have been returning each day.

<P>
UVIRA:  By October 29, 220,000 refugees had fled the fighting
around the Uvira camps.  The camps are reported to be completely
empty and most have been burned.  Up to 80,000 refugees are
thought to have moved north, while 400,000 refugees and
internally displaced Zairians are believed to have moved south
toward Fizi, Zaire.  Uvira town was looted widely.  The
Banyamulenge rebels control Uvira town, its airport, and the area
between it and Bukavu.

<P>
NUMBERS AFFECTED:  As all roads and airports into eastern Zaire
are closed, the international community has lost contact with the
refugees and internally displaced Zairians.  Up to one million
Rwandan and Burundian refugees and internally displaced Zairians
have been affected by the fighting.  Current estimates of refugee
and repatriation flows are as follows:  7,000 (mainly Zairian)
refugees have fled to Kigoma, Tanzania; 10,800 Burundian
returnees have arrived at Gatumba, Burundi; 12,000 persons have
crossed into Cibitoke, Burundi; 5,300 Zairian refugees have fled
to Burundi;  10,600 Zairian and Rwandan refugees have crossed
into Kisoro and Ishasha ports in Uganda; 5,158 Zairian and
Burundian refugees and Rwandan returnees have crossed into
Gisenyi and Cyangugu, Rwanda.  The Congo and Zambia have received
roughly 1,000 refugees each.

<P>
USG ASSISTANCE:  On October 26, USAID/BHR/OFDA deployed a
Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to Kigali, Rwanda.  The
DART's primary mission is to assess the current situation, supply
informational updates, and provide funding to non-governmental
organizations, U.N. agencies, and international organizations for
programs to assist with repatriation efforts and readiness in
Rwanda.  On November 7, 1996, U.S. Ambassador Robert Gribbin
declared a disaster in Rwanda, noting that the refugee crisis in
eastern Zaire poses a humanitarian emergency for Rwanda.

<H2>Gevaarlijke Voedsel Aditieven - Dangerous Food Additives</H2>

<hr>
<a name="ned">
<h3>Voedsel Aditieven</h3></a>
<ul>

<li>- <b>Sunset Yellow (E110)</b> - synthetische kleurstof die allergische
reakties en hyperactiviteit kan veroorzaken; bij proeven op dieren werd een
verhoogd risico op tumoren vastgesteld; is verboden in Noorwegen.


<li>- <b>Amaranth(E123)</b> - synthetische kleurstof die astma, eczema en
hyperactiviteit kan veroorzaken; bij sommige proeven op dieren werden 
werd gebreken bij geboortes en afsterven van de foetus vastgesteld, alsook
kanker; verboden in de USA.


<li>- <b>Sodium Nitriet (E250)</b>  Potassium Nitrate (E252) -
bewaarmiddel en kleurfixatief dat hyperactiviteit kan veroozaken; mogelijk
kankerverwekkend; het gebruik is strikt beperkt in een aantal landen.


<li>- <b>BHA (E320) & BHT (E321)</b> - 
synthetische antioxidant, die hyperactiviteit kan losmaken; er bestaan 
vermoedens dat het kankerverwekkend is; BHA is verboden in Japan; in 
1958 en 1963 adviseerden officiele expertcommissies om het te verbieden in
Engeland, maar door druk van de industrie bleef het behouden. In de US
weerde McDonald's BHT uit zijn produkten.


<li>- <b>Carrageen (E407)</b> - 
stabilisator en verdikker; verdacht van toxische risico's, inclusief voor
zweren en kanker; gedegradeerde carrageen is gevaarlijk en is verboden als aditief. Verse
carrageen kan echter degraderen in de darm.

<li>- <b>Monosodium Glutamaat (621)</b> - 
smaakverbeteraar, kan de hersenchemie aantasten.


<li>- <b>Potassium Bromaat (924)</b> - 
gebruikt als smaakverbeteraar, verboden in 1989, is een gevaarlijke 
kankerverwekker


</ul>

<h3>Additives</h3></a>
<ul>

<li>- <b>Sunset Yellow (E110)</b> - a synthetic colourant, which can
provoke allergic reactions and hyperactivity; and increased incidence of
tumours in animals; banned in Norway. 

<li>- <b>Amaranth(E123)</b> - a synthetic colourant, which can provoke
asthma, eczema and hyperactivity; it caused birth defects and foetal
deaths in some animal tests, possibly also cancer; banned in the USA,
Russia and at least 5 other countries. 

<li>- <b>Sodium Nitrite (E250)</b> and Potassium Nitrate (E252) -
preservatives and colour fixatives, which may provoke hyperactivity and
other adverse reactions; potentially carcinogenic; their use is severely
restricted in many countries. 

<li>- <b>BHA (E320) & BHT (E321)</b> - synthetic antioxidants, which may
trigger hyperactivity and other intolerances; serious concerns over
carcinogenicity; BHA is banned in Japan; in 1958 & 1963 official
committees of experts recommended that BHT be ban ned in the UK, however
due to industry pressure it was not banned; McDonald's eliminated BHT from
their US products by 1986. 

<li>- <b>Carrageenan (E407)</b> - stabiliser and thickening agent; linked
to toxic hazards, including ulcers and cancer; the most serious concerns
relate to degraded carrageenan, which is not a permitted additive. 
However, native carrageenan, which is us ed, may become degraded in the
gut. 

<li>- <b>Monosodium Glutamate (621)</b> - flavour enhancer, which can
cause intolerant reactions and effect chemistry of the brain. 

<li>- <b>Potassium Bromate (924)</b> - used as flour improver, banned in
1989 as a dangerous carcinogen; previously widely used in bread products,
including McDonald's buns.<p>

<h3>
<DT><a name="I">Inforobots Algemeen</a>
</h3>
<DD>
Als je aan een inforobot op Internet een trefwoord opgeeft, geeft hij als 
resultaat tientallen, soms honderden URL's, dit zijn verwijzingen naar 
documenten
die dat trefwoord bevatten. Deze documenten kunnen home pages zijn, 
andere WWW-bladzijden,  
nieuwsberichten of artikels uit digitale tijdschriften. Via deze URL kan
men dan die documenten opvragen.
<br><br>
Dit is mogelijk doordat krachtige computers dagelijks het net naar
die documenten afspeuren. Ze steken alle woorden van die documenten dan in 
een INDEX
met verwijzing naar de plaats waar ze zich bevinden. Inforobots zoeken in 
deze indexen naar het trefwoord dat je hen opgeeft, en geven dan de 
vindplaatsen van die documenten als resultaat.
Soms bevat het resultaat ook  een korte beschijving van het document.
<br><br>



</DD>

<h3>
<DT><a name="A">Over de KnoopPunt-Nieuwsdatabank</a>
</h3>
<DD>

Dagelijks indexeren wij berichten uit verschillende 
<a href="forums.html">forums, conferenties, beschikbaar op onze server</a>
gegroepeerd per thema. Deze berichten komen terecht in een tekst-databank
per thema. Men kan in die databanken dan zoeken op basis van woorden of
combinaties van woorden. Als resultaat krijg je een lijst van titels van
artikels waarin die trefwoorden voorkomen in de tekst. Deze artikels kan
je bekijken door de titellijn aan te klikken. De naam van de conferentie van 
waaruit het artikel afkomstig is, staat vermeld bovenaan het artikel op de
nieuwsgroeplijn. 

Raadpleeg ook het  overzicht van alle 
<a href="APC_CONF.HTML">APC-conferenties</a>. Zijn er conferenties waarvan je 
denkt dat ze thuishoren in deze tekst-databank, of stel je een
andere schikking voor,
geef dan hier je <a href="http://www.knooppunt.be/cgi-bin/eval.pl">anonieme
commentaar</a> of stuur een mailtje naar
<address><a href="mailto:daniel@knooppunt.be">daniel@knooppunt.be</a></address>

</DD>

<h3>
<DT><a name="Z">Zoektechnieken Algemeen</a>
</h3>
<DD>

Men kan met zoekrobots zoeken op basis van woorden of combinaties van 
woorden.
Alle robots kunnen dezelfde gelijkaardige combinaties verwerken, alleen
verschilt hier en daar de notatie van die combinatie. We bespreken hier de
combinaties die overal voorkomen.
<br><br>
<font size=5>OF</font>-combinatie<br>
Als men of het ene of het andere woord zoekt, spreekt men van een 
<b>OF</b>-combinatie. Deze kan je gebruiken als je twijfelt aan de 
schrijfwijze van een woord, of om synoniemen op te geven.<br>
Meestal kan men de woorden gewoon naast mekaar plaatsen, gescheiden door 
een spatie, om dit te bedoelen. Dit betekent niet dat met vereist dat
de woorden in de tekst na mekaar voorkomen!
<br><br>
<font size=5>EN</font>-combinatie<br>
Als men vereist dat meerdere woorden in dezelfde tekst <b>terzelfder 
tijd</b> 
voorkomen, spreekt men van een <b>EN</b>-combinatie. Dit wordt meestal aangegeven
door voor beide woorden een +-teken te zetten, maar dit werkt 
bijvoorbeeld niet zo bij Excite.
<br><br>
<font size=5>NIET</font>-combinatie<br>
Door <b>NIET</b> te gebruiken bij een term sluit je teksten uit waarin die term 
voorkomt.
<br><br>
<font size=5>PHRASE</font>-combinatie<br>
PHRASE is het Engelse woord voor ZIN. Het drukt uit dat twee of meerdere 
woorden in de tekst <b>NA ELKAAR</B> moeten voorkomen. Dit wordt dikwijls 
opgegeven
door de woorden tussen aanhalingstekens te plaatsen, maar hier verwacht de
MetaCrawler deze woorden tussen ronde haakjes.
<br><br>

<font size=5>WILDCHARDS</font><br>
Dikwijls weet men niet precies in welke vorm een woord zal voorkomen. Als men
bijvoorbeeld zoekt naar iets dat te maken heeft met Belgi&euml;, kan het 
zijn dat
dit in de tekst staat als: belg, belgie, belgisch, belgian, belgium enz.
Door het variabele gedeelte aan te geven als een WILDCHARD (joker), 
laat men alle schijfwijzen open. Meestal wordt hiervoor een 
asterix gebruik. Ons voorbeeld wordt dan:
<pre>belg*</pre>.


</DD>
<h3>
<DT><a name="B">Zoeken in de KnoopPunt-Databank</a></DT>
</h3>
<DD>
Als men of het ene of het andere woord zoekt, kan men de woorden gewoon naast
elkaar plaatsen, gescheiden door een spatie. 
<br><br>
Als men vereist dat meerdere woorden in dezelfde tekst terzelfder tijd 
voorkomen, moet men er AND tussenzetten. Om bijvoorbeeld de berichten 
verstuurd in juni 1996 over vluchtelingen op te zoeken, geeft men als 
zoekterm:
<br>

<font size=5>
<pre>Jun AND 1996 AND vluchtelingen</pre>
</font>
<br>
Artikels van Juni 1996  over vluchtelingen en Vande Lanotte 
selecteer je door:
<br>
<font size=5>
<pre>Jun AND 1996 AND vluchtelingen lanotte</pre>
</font>
<br>
Opgelet: getallen moeten altijd voorafgegaan worden door een spatie.
<br><br>
Als je teveel niet relevante antwoorden krijgt, kan je gaan filteren door
NOT te gebruiken. Als je NOT voor een term zet, dan sluit
je teksten uit waar die term in voorkomt.
<br><br>
Artikels van Juni 1996  over vluchtelingen maar waar de naam Vande Lanotte 
niet in voorkomst selecteer je door:
<br>
<font size=5>
<pre>Jun AND 1996 AND vluchtelingen NOT lanotte</pre>
</font>
<br>
Het zoeken op exacte data is nog niet ge&iuml;mplementeerd.
<br><br>

Als je twijfelt aan de schrijfwijze van een term, kan je met een gedeelte
van die term (het eerste gedeelte) nagaan welke termen voorkomen in de databank
die beginnen met het opgegeven gedeelte. Gebruik daarvoor de 'expand'-knop.
<br><br>
Je kan ook zoeken met behulp van een gedeelte van een woord. Maar dan moet
je een '*' gebruiken voor het gedeelte dat je weglaat. Wil je bijvoorbeeld 
zoeken naar artikels waar 'Ghana' of 'Ghandi' in voorkomen, dan geef je op:
<br>
<font size=5>
<pre>ghan*</pre>
</font>
<br>
Hoofdletters of kleine letters zijn van geen belang.
<br><br>
<font size=6>
H</font>et zoekresultaat is een lijst van titels van artikels die aan de
opgegeven voorwaarden voldoen.  Het achterliggende artikel vraag je op
door er simpelweg op te klikken. In de tekst van het artikel, vormen de
gezochte woorden een link naar mekaar. Op die manier kan je snel de
relevantie van het artikel nagaan.

<a name="REL">Relevantie en werkbaarheid</a>
<blockquote>

De relevantie van de gevonden informatie is afhankelijkheid van veel 
faktoren. Er is een overaanbod van niet-gestructureerde informatie waarin
je gemakkelijk verloren loopt. Het vereist voldoende discipline en een 
ervaring om effici&euml;nt informatie terug te vinden.
<br><br>

Hoe precieser je jouw zoekopdracht weet te formuleren, hoe beter het resultaat
zal zijn. Het is belangrijk dat men de terminologie kent die gebruikt wordt
binnen het terrein waar men zoekt. Bovendien moet je er mee rekening houden
dat 80 % van de documenten op het net in het Engels zijn.
<br><br>
Evalueer regelmatig je resultaten. Op basis van de relevantie van
deze resultaten kan je meer specifieke zoektermen gaan gebruiken.


<br><br>

Inforobotten kennen de betekenis van de woorden niet die ze zoeken. 
Voor hen zijn woorden een bepaalde combinatie van letters. De betekenis
van woorden is bovendien afhankelijk van de contekst waarin ze voorkomen.
Het woord tafel kan slaan op de tafel van vermenigvuldigingen, een tafel
om aan te zitten of zelfs eten in de zin 'ik tafel graag in kleine 
restaurants.'
Door teksten te groeperen per thema in onze nieuwsdatabank, is de
context natuurlijk duidelijk omschreven.

<br><br>
Door het maken van logische combinaties kan je de robot naar een bepaalde 
context leiden. Eens je de context goed hebt, betekent het nog niet dat
je valabele en werkbare antwoorden krijgt. Je vindt wel iets. Maar woorden
worden altijd gebruikt met bepaalde doelstellingen in een bepaalde praxis,
en deze zal nogal eens verschillend zijn van mens tot mens, van organisatie
tot organisatie. 
<br><br>
<b>
Een goede werkwijze is een drietal gevonden teksten te
bewaren, deze off line te analiseren om op basis van die analyse opnieuw
te gaan zoeken.
</b>
<br><br>
</blockquote>

<li>
<a name="BET">Betrouwbaarheid</a>
<blockquote>
De betrouwbaarheid van gevonden informatie kan je nagaan door je vragen
te stellen over de informatiebron.<br>
* Wie publiceert dit, wat is zijn autoriteit op dat vlak, is het een 
universiteit of een commerci&euml;le organisatie?<br>
* Is de bron duidelijk over zichzelf?  De reden van publicatie? Publiciteit of
informatie?<br>
* Stelt de bron bewijsmateriaal ter beschikking? Worden er referenties
opgegeven, links naar vergelijkbare informatie?<br>
* Wordt de informatie regelmatig bijgehouden. Van wanneer dateert ze?
Over welke periode gaat het hier?<br>
* Is het feitelijke informatie of opinie?<br>
</blockquote>

<br><br>
<li>
<a name="EXP">Raadpleeg de experten</a>

<blockquote>
Informatieuitwisseling is afhankelijk van de kwaliteit van communicatie.
Als je enkel met een machine en met inforobots communiceert, moet u niet 
verwonderd zijn dat bepaalde subtiliteiten je ontgaan, of dat u zelfs helemaal
de bal mis slaat. 
<br><br>

Daarom zijn nieuwsconferenties (APC en Usenet) en mailinglists waar men
van gedachten wisselt met <b>experten</b> rond een bepaald onderwerp van
doorslaggevend belang.  Neem deel aan de 
<a href="forums.html">forums, conferenties, beschikbaar op onze server</a>
van waaruit de berichten afkomstig zijn. Daar kan je gerichte vragen stellen
en kom je automatisch terecht bij mensen die de materie kennen.
INFORMATIE IS COMMUNICATIE.

<li>Als je werkt met Windows 3.1 met een 28.8 modem en een UART 16550
dan heb je een andere
<a href="ftp://kick.knooppunt.be/pub/comm/cybc114.exe">

buiten zone 09</a> belt, kan je in de directory plaatsten waar de nieuwe versie
van Trumpet staat.
<p>
<li><a href="ftp://kick.knooppunt.be/pub/irc/">

<a name="A"></a><h2>Wat is KnoopPunt?</h2>

Via KnoopPunt kan je jouw computer gebruiken als een 
elektronisch postkantoor, als een conferentiecentrum of documentatiecentrum. 
KnoopPunt geeft ook advies en training. 
<p>
<img align=bottom src="mail.gif" alt=""> KnoopPunt gebruikers krijgen hun eigen 
postbus op het systeem. Organisaties kunnen zelfs hun eigen postsorteercentrum 
krijgen op hun eigen PC of locaal netwerk. KnoopPunt verwerkt het Internet 
mail exchange domein <tt>knooppunt.be</tt>. Je kan via KnoopPunt ook 
elektronische brieven sturen naar gebruikers van andere netwerken of 
systemen zoals Compuserve, Bitnet, FidoNet...
<p>
KnoopPunt levert "full fledged" toegang tot Internet. KnoopPunt wil de
drempels naar elektronische informatie verlagen. Door systematisch onderzoek
en aangepaste toepassingen, wil KnoopPunt zijn gebruikers helpen om hun weg 
te vinden in het overaanbod van informatie.
<p>
Er bestaan vele misverstanden over wat Internet biedt. KnoopPunt is reeds 3 
jaar actief als informatieleverancier tegen de goedkoopst vindbare 
tarieven in 
Belgi&euml;. Om alles betaalbaar te houden, zijn wij niet meegehuppeld 
met de 
hype die nu rond Internet bestaat. KnoopPunt doet aan informatieverzorging, 
en dat is meer dan prentjes tonen. 
<p>
Naast goedkoop zijn, pogen we ook de gebruikers te helpen met indelen van
informatie in <a href="/ned/resources/knooppunt/index.html">informatiegebieden</a> 
en het geven van betaalbare <a href="/ned/info/training/index.html">cursussen</a> 
om gebruikers te leren in het doolhof en overaanbod van informatie hun weg te 
vinden. 
<p>
KnoopPunt geeft advies over hoe je het netwerk best kan gebruiken, 
hoe je je communicatiekosten kan drukken en nieuws over jouw 
activiteiten kan verspreiden. Je kan ook terecht bij KnoopPunt voor 
<i>Information broking</i> (leveren van informatie). Planning en 
structurering 
van je communicatie- en informatiebehoeften is een onderwerp voor de 
KnoopPunt-consultants.

<a name="C"></a><h2>KnoopPunt als internationale organisatie</h2>

<a name="apcmember"></a>
<img src="apc.jpg" alt="">
In Rio, op 14 november 1995 heeft de council van de 
<a href="http://www.apc.org/apc/">Association for Progressive Communications</a>
(APC) besloten KnoopPunt officieel als lid te aanvaarden. Hiertoe was
een aanvraag ingediend door KnoopPunt. Vanaf heden fungeert KnoopPunt dus als
een volwaardig lid van deze organisatie en dit betekent dat wij van alle faciliteiten van
deze organisatie gebruik kunnen maken en tevens belangrijk, dat wij ook deel
uitmaken van de beslissingsstructuur van die organisatie. 
<p>
APC is een wereldwijd netwerk dat gebruikt wordt in meer dan 
100 landen (GreenNet, Peacenet, Antenna, Glasnet, Alternex, Nicarao...).  
Dit netwerk wordt ook heel intensief gebruikt in het zuiden. 
APC brengt nieuws van een zeer hoog niveau, dat enkel en 
<strong>exclusief door KnoopPunt verdeeld</strong> wordt in Belgi&euml;.
<p>

<img align=bottom src="news.gif" alt="">
In de APC-conferenties komt een  breed gamma van topics aan bod.  
Verslagen van milieurampen, documenten van de UNO in verband met milieu 
of informatie over de campagnes van milieugroepen.  Je vindt er elke dag 
nieuws over de evolutie in Oost-Europa en vele andere landen, 
vooral uit de Derde Wereld.  Feiten over bewapening, internationale 
campagnes van de vredesbeweging of studies rond wapenconversie komen 
aan bod.
Je vindt er kwaliteitsmateriaal en achtergrondinformatie als je je voor 
specifieke landen interesseert. 
<p>
Zo krijgen KnoopPunt-gebruikers toegang tot de meest verscheidene 
informatiebronnen - elektronische conferenties - waar, experts, 
media en organisaties nieuws brengen over hun activiteiten en 
materiaal uitwisselen.  Bovendien kunnen abonnees van KnoopPunt 
vragen om nieuwe conferenties op het systeem te openen.

Alle conferenties aangeboden door APC 
via <a href="http://www.gn.apc.org/">Greennet</a> kunnen worden aangesloten.
<p>
Daarnaast is KnoopPunt ook aangesloten bij het 
<em>Ander Nederlands Nieuws netwerk</em> en kan het voor u ook een van 5500 
<em>USENET</em>-conferenties aansluiten.

<a name="G"><h2></a>Hoe bereik je KnoopPunt?</h2>

Met een modem, lijninstellingen 
<em>8 bits, geen pariteit</em> en <em>1 stop-bit</em>, en een communicatie 
pakket (Procomm, Telix, Microphone...) op je PC, Mac of andere computer ...  
kan je KnoopPunt opbellen.  De nummers zijn:

<ul>
<li>09 234 16 95
<li>09 234 12 97
<li>09 224 04 54
</ul>

Als terminal emulatie kies je best <tt>vt100</tt>.
<p>
Op die manier kan je interactief werken met KnoopPunt. 
<p>
Met IP-software (MacPPP, Trumpet Winsock), kan je een PPP-link opzetten 
met de KnoopPunt server. Als je een PPP-link
hebt, ben je virtueel een onderdeel van Internet. Dit wil zeggen dat je nu op je PC of Mac
alle toepassingen kan opstarten die je laten gebruik maken van Internet. Met Eudora kan je mail
lezen en versturen, met Netscape kan je surfen op het net, met Agent of 
Nuntius kan je nieuws lezen,
met FTP-software kan je bestanden halen van om het even welke Internet host.
Met programma's als Eudora en Agent kan je echter zowel offline als online werken.

<h2>UUCP-mailer met eigen mail domein en met mail en news reader voor WINDOWS of Mac</h2>

Bij het gebruik van UUCP worden Interactieve sessies volledig achterwege gelaten.  
Een mailer is een software die voor jou een eigen postsorteercentrum opzet. 
Deze software laat je toe tijdens een korte volledige automatische verlopende uitwissellingssessie, 
klaarstaande post en nieuws af te halen en op te sturen.  Je leest en schrijft 'mail' en 'news'
 offline.  Een UUCP-account heeft een soort mini-BBS, met een eigen naam, domein.  
Dit laat hem toe meerdere gebruikers via zijn systeem te laten werken.

<title>Proxy's en Socks</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffee" font size="+1" link="#008000" alink= "#000099" vlink="#139000" TEXT="#304000">
<h1><a href="http://www.knooppunt.be/">
<img border=1 align=right src="/icons/logo.gif" alt="KnoopPunt"></a>
Proxy's en Socks</h1>

<br clear=right>
<ul>
<p>
<li>Bij een PPP-link fungeert de KnoopPunt-server als <i>firewall</i> 
tussen jouw computer en de rest van Internet. Dat wil zeggen dat men vanop 
Internet niet tot bij jouw computer kan komen, terwijl je <I>on line</i> bent. Maar
dat heeft ook voor gevolg dat je nooit direct een andere computer op 
Internet kan bereiken. Je moet altijd via onze <i>firewall</i> naar die andere
computer toe. Deze <i>firewall</i> functionneert dan als doorgeefluik. 
<p>
<li>Dit wordt op onze server mogelijk gemaakt via 2 mechanismen:<br>
De proxy-configuratie van onze CERN WWW-server en SOCKS.<br>

<p>
<li> Als je 
het WWW opgaat dan is het onze 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Daemon/">
CERN-webserver</a>
die als doorgeefluik, 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Proxies/">
proxy</a>,
functioneert. Daarom moet je dan ook proxy's configureren in je WWW-client
software, Netscape. Daar moet je als proxy-server voor de verschillende 
toepassingen <code>naar.knooppunt.be</code> defini&euml;ren met port 80 
en als socks-host <code>
naar.knooppunt.be</code> met port 1080. Onze webserver doet ook aan <i>caching</i>, 
waardoor je snellere responstijden krijgt.
<p>
<li>Het doorgeefluik van onze WWW-server werkt niet voor programma's 
als WS_FTP, TELNET-clients, IRC e.d. op jouw computer. Het werkt alleen voor 
WWW. Voor alle andere toepassingen draaien wij de
<a href="http://www.socks.nec.com/">SOCKS</a>
proxy-server versie 5.<br> 
Om van dit doorgeefluik te kunnen gebruik maken moet je 
<a href="ftp://ftp.knooppunt.be/pub/socks/sc16b052.zip">
sockscap 16 bits voor Windows 3.x</a> of 
<a href="ftp://ftp.knooppunt.be/pub/socks/sc32a011.zip">
sockscap 32 bits voor Win95</a> 
installeren en configureren. Dit programma moet direct na Trumpet worden 
opgestart. Als SOCK-host kan je 191.10.201.200 opgeven. Als port moet je hier ook 
1080 opgeven. 
<p>
<li>
<strong>
Opgelet, je kan niet terzelfder tijd proxy's via sockscap gebruiken 
met de proxy's 
van Netscape. Als je Netscape wil gebruiken met sockscap moet je de 
proxy's eerst afzetten.
</strong> Bij de testen die we gedaan hebben, liep er een en ander mis 
bij samengebruik van sockscap en Netscape. Het sluiten van sockscap betekent
niet noodzakelijk dat het opgeruimd is in het geheugen en dat het geen conflicten 
(errors) meer kan veroorzaken.
<p>
<li>De Mac-gebruikers kunnen FETCH ook configureren voor SOCKS.
<p>
<li>In Windows 95 kan je proxies configureren voor alle Internet programma's.
In het configuratiescherm (Control Pannel) dat je opent door dubbel te
klikken op Deze Computer (My Computer), moet je dubbelklikken op Internet.
Daar moet je Gebruik Proxy Server (Use Proxy Server) aanklikken en in het 
veld voor Proxy server <b>naar.knooppunt.be</b> invullen.

De nieuwsgroep van de anti-surfers is
<a href="news:kikk.info">kikk.info</a>.
In kikk.info zullen geregeld interessante vondsten op het net verschijnen:
URL's, nieuwsgroepen en rondzendlijsten. Je kan er ook vragen stellen over 
hoe, wat en waar je info moet zoeken, en waar je kan publiceren. Het 
overaanbod van informatie leidt tot desinformatie, daarom is er kikk.info.

<h3>Gulden tip!</h3>
Stuur je mail maar naar &eacute;&eacute;n adres. Dus geen 
<a href="#cc">carbon copy's</a> 
naar postmaster
als je Support wilt spreken, en vice versa. Ons humeur daalt direct 
enkele graden als we merken dat we dubbel werk verricht hebben. 
En jij krijgt twee antwoorden die je dan tegen elkaar moet opwegen.
Gelukkig spreken we elkaar hier niet teveel tegen.

<a name="tips"><h3>Gebruikerstips van Support</h3></a>
<p><b>De installatie van Internet Software</b>
<p>Wie een account neemt bij KnoopPunt heeft recht op de installatiediskettes
van KnoopPunt. Daar staan alle programma's op die je nodig hebt om ons systeem
maximaal te benutten. Bij de diskettes krijg je ook een 
<a href="/ned/info/software/instwinsoft.html">handleiding 
voor Windows</a> of een
<a href="/ned/info/software/macinst.html">handleiding 
voor Macintosh</a> om de programma's te installeren.
<p>Let er wel op dat er geen andere Internet-software 'rondslingert' op je harde
schijf. Heb je bijvoorbeeld ooit eens zo'n gratis Internet-diskette op je harde 
schijf ge&iuml;nstalleerd, gooi die er dan eerst af.
<p>Heb je problemen met de programma's, lees dan 
<a href="#prog">hier</a> 
de commentaren bij de geleverde programmatuur. 
<p><b>Faxprogramma's</b>
<p>Gebruikers die bellen naar de Helpdesk (09 233 81 55) geven ons
vaak de meest bizarre uitleg over het niet functioneren van hun software. Na
een tijdje alle mogelijke complicaties overlopen te hebben, blijkt dan 
plots dat een 'faxprogramma' opgestart is. Vandaar is een van onze eerste
standaardvragen bij het helpen van gebruikers via de telefoon: Is het 
faxprogramma gesloten?
Denk eraan: eens het faxprogramma open staat is de poort naar je modem
permanent bezet en zal de Internet-software voor een gesloten poort staan.
<p><b>Heb je wel een link?</b>
<p>Hier staat of valt alles mee. Programma's zoals Netscape
zullen niet functioneren, je
krijgt foutmeldingen ... als er geen link is met KnoopPunt. Hou dus je modem
goed in de gaten, en probeer er zeker van te zijn dat je communicatieprogramma
goed werkt. 
<p>Externe modems hebben hebben o.a. het voordeel dat je een display krijgt
waardoor je kan zien dat gegevens verscheept worden. Hou die 
modem dan ook in de gaten. Wij voelen ons niet verantwoordelijk voor het
niet functioneren van modems die niet door ons ge&iuml;nstalleerd zijn, wat
niet wil zeggen dat we je bij problemen niet zullen helpen, integendeel.

<p><b>Zoek alternatieve werkmethodes</b>
<p>Wie er bijvoorbeeld maar niet in slaagt om 
<a href="#eudora">Eudora</a> geconfigureerd 
te krijgen, en dringend post moet verzenden, kan altijd een alternatief vinden
door <a href="#pine">Pine</a>
te gebruiken. Nadeel: Pine is een <i>Character based</i>-programma en
heel wat minder gebruiksvriendelijk dan Eudora. Maar het is beter dan niets.
<p>Stel het is midden in de nacht en je moet dringend post versturen 
en Eudora werkt niet. Support uit zijn bed bellen lijkt je net iets te 
drastisch (jawel, we slapen hier naast onze computers). Dan log je in, en start
een Telnet-sessie. Tik dan <code>pine</code> in en probeer er het beste van
te maken.
<p>'s Morgens kun je dan Support opbellen of hem diezelfde nacht nog
mailen, om hem te zeggen dat hij je als de bliksem moet helpen met Eudora, 
maar dat je gelukkig nog met Pine hebt kunnen werken.
<p>Dit korte verhaaltje dient enkel om te illustreren, dat wie naar 
alternatieven zoekt, ze kan vinden, maar inderdaad werken met Pine is
moeilijker dan werken met Eudora. Werken met 
<a href="#lynx">Lynx</a> is niet hetzelfde als surfen met 
<a href="#netscape">Netscape</a>; en FTP is ook heel wat leuker
onder Windows of Mac dan op de Unix-shell.    
<p><b>...Als het echt niet lukt</b>
<p>In de media wordt Internet vaak voorgesteld als het toonbeeld van 
gebruiksvriendelijkheid. In de praktijk merken wij echter dat het
niet allemaal <i>Plug and Play</i> is voor de gebruiker.
De pioniersdagen van de datacommunicatie
zijn gelukkig voorbij, maar dat betekent niet dat het makkelijk is.
<p>Vooreerst zoek hulp voor je problemen. Support is er om problemen 
op te lossen, je valt hem niet lastig door te mailen, te bellen,
te faxen. Integendeel, je verschaft hem werk. 
<p>Raadpleeg alle mogelijke handleidingen. Je bent reeds op het Web geraakt
(anders zat je nu deze bladzijde niet te lezen maar de krant), dus kan je 
<a href="/ned/info/man">de handleidingen op het Web</a> 
gaan raadplegen. Er is ook een cursus van 
KnoopPunt zelf 
<a href="/ned/info/man/lesmap.html">online</a> beschikbaar.
<p>KnoopPunt geeft ook 
<a href="/ned/info/training">cursus</a>, 
de data kun je krijgen door contact op te nemen met Support.

<a name="prog"><h3>Commentaar van Support bij programmatuur</h3></a>
<dl>
<dt><b>Trumpet Winsock</b>
<dd>Met dit programma kun je een <a href="#shell">PPP-link</a> 
opzetten met KnoopPunt. Functioneert dit
programma niet, dan mag je het wel vergeten. Overigens kan je met programma's
als Telix, Procomm,... een <a href="#shell">Shell-access</a> opzetten 
waardoor je dan met
Pine bijv. post kunt zenden naar Support om te melden dat die #?!!#? 
Trumpet weer eens niet werkt.
<dd>Tip van de Postmaster: PPP-options, afblijven. 
<dd>Ook belangrijk: bij Trumpet zit een file <code>winsock.dll</code>. Indien
ergens anders op je harde schijf nog een bestand zit met dezelfde naam, gooi
die er dan af, of hernoem ze! Indien dat niet gebeurt, mag je problemen 
verwachten. Als je de foutmelding
<i>winsock.dll not found</i> krijgt, kan je altijd <code>winsock.dll</code> 
kopi&euml;ren
(niet verplaatsen) naar de Windows-directory. Windows eens heropstarten 
na herhaalde malen proberen kan ook helpen. 
<dt><a name="eudora"><b>Eudora</b></a>
<dd>Eudora is een programma om post te lezen en te verzenden.
Eens Eudora ge&iuml;nstalleerd en geconfigureerd is (zoals vermeld op de 
KnoopPunt-installatiediskette) is het een zalig programma om mee te 
werken. Vergeleken met andere mailreaders weliswaar. Wil je offline werken
met Eudora dan hoef je je paswoord NIET in te geven, dit moet enkel als je 
online werkt op de KnoopPunt-server.
<br>Er is ook online een 
<a href="/ned/info/man/eudora/eudora.html">beknopte handleiding</a>
voor Eudora beschikbaar
<dt><a name="pine"><b>Pine</b></a>
<dd>Pine is een programma dat op ons systeem staat, en gebruikt wordt
om post te versturen. Het is een 'Character-based' programma en dus niet zo
gebruiksvriendelijk als Eudora. Je kunt het opstarten door op het 
Telnet-icoontje te klikken, je login-naam en paswoord in te tikken en daarna 
<code>pine[enter]</code> te tikken. Daarna krijg je een menu waaruit je
met de pijltjestoetsen kunt selecteren. Best misschien eerst eens een ? in 
te tikken om de helpfile te lezen.<br>
De functietoetsen staan onderaan het scherm aangegeven. Alle
subprogramma's werken met pijltjestoetsen en <i>hotkeys</i>, d.w.z. dat 
je niet meer op <code>[enter
</code> hoeft te drukken. 
<br>
Je kan berichten bewaren in een folder (mail) of file (nieuws). Elke
folder of file kan meerdere berichten bevatten. Deze folder of file kan je
dan achteraf downloaden vanuit het hoofdmenu (menukeuze 'd' voor
mailfolder, menukeuze 's' voor nieuwsfile).  In het mailprogramma kan je
ook oude folders verwijderen.
<br>
Je kan ook files uploaden in je homedirectory met Z-modem. Daarvoor moet
je eerst menukeuze 'u' gebruiken en dan het uploaden starten aan uw kant.
Deze file kan je dan importeren in de editor van het mail- of
nieuwsprogramma met <code>[control]r</code>.    
<br>Er is ook online een
<a href="/ned/info/man/pine.html">handleiding</a>
voor Pine beschikbaar.
<dt><a name="netscape"><b>Netscape</b></a>
<dd>Met dit programma kan je het World Wide Web op. Ongeveer 70 % van de 
WWW-surfers werken met een of andere versie van Netscape. 
<dd>Interessant om
hier op te merken is dat je met Netscape ook nieuws kunt gaan lezen. Dit
laatste omdat URL's die in nieuwsberichten vermeld 
worden in Netscape gewoon kunnen worden aangeklikt. 
<dt><a name="lynx"><b>Lynx</b></a>
<dd>Met Lynx kan je werken nadat je in een
<a href="#shell">shell</a> bent gegaan op de 
KnoopPunt-server en door het volgende in te tikken: <code>lynx[return]</code> 
en daarna <tt>'Go'</tt> te 
selecteren waarna je de URL van de bladzijde kan opgeven. Je kan rechtstreeks
naar de bladzijde door bijv. <code>lynx http://www.igc.apc.org</code> in te tikken
na de Unix-prompt.
Lynx is heel wat primitiever dan Netscape en je kan er enkel tekst mee
lezen. Vergeet niet: het programma draait niet bij je thuis, maar op de
server hier. Opslaan van bestanden gebeurt dus in je home directory 
bij KnoopPunt. Dit programma
is een aanrader voor al wie snel wil werken en al dat grafisch gedoe
maar lulkoek vindt.
<br>Er is ook online een
<a href="/ned/info/man/shell/Lynx_users_guide.html">handleinding</a>
voor Lynx beschikbaar.
<dt><b>Trumpet Newsreader</b>
<dd>Met dit programma dat onder Windows draait, kun je nieuws gaan lezen. Het
werkt enkel terwijl je online bent. Maar dan kan je alle nieuwsgroepen die 
bij KnoopPunt gedefinieerd staan lezen en kan je je eigen berichten posten. 
<dt><b>Free Agent</b>
<dd>Er is ook nog een andere newsreader 'Free Agent' en veel gebruikers 
vinden dit laatste programma makkelijker te hanteren
omdat je het ook offline kan gaan gebruiken om nieuws
te lezen. De keuze ligt bij jou. Let wel: bij Agent wordt het 
binnengehaalde nieuws op je harde schijf geplaatst. Wie weinig plaats 
heeft op z'n harde schijf gaat best af en toe eens schoonmaken in de directory
waar Agent staat. Gecombineerd met het offline gebruiken van Eudora kan
Agent je tijd op het Net aardig inkorten, wat voordelig is voor je 
telefoon- en accountskosten. 'Free Agent' staat NIET op de 
KnoopPunt-installatiediskettes,
je moet het dus zelf gaan 
<a href="ftp://ftp.knooppunt.be/pub/IP-software/windows/agent.zip">downloaden!</a>

<dt><a name="tin"><b>Tin</b></a>
<dd>Dit is nog zo'n programma dat je in een <a href="#shell">shell</a>
kunt starten. Om het
te starten tik je <code>tin[enter]</code>. Via menu's met
nieuwsgroepen
kan je selecteren tot je op het niveau zit dat je berichten kunt gaan lezen.
<dd>Indien je een 
<a href="#sig">signature</a> maakt in Tin, let er dan op dat die signature
niet langer is dan drie regels, anders kun je het posten van nieuwsberichten
wel vergeten. Heb je in Pine een signature file aangemaakt onder 
<tt>.signature</tt>, dan zal tin deze file als signature aannemen en als
deze langer is dan drie regels, kan je dus niet posten (in Pine mag een
signature wel langer zijn dan 3 regels).

<a name="me"><h3>De meest gestelde vragen aan Support</h3></a>
<p><a name="shell"><b>Wat is het verschil tussen 'Shell-Access' en 
'IP-Access'?</b></a>
<p>Bij 'Shell-Access' worden de programma's gestart op de server van KnoopPunt
zelf. Dus in feite ben je dan aan het werken op onze computer. Bij 'IP-access'
worden de programma's bij jou thuis of op kantoor opgestart, en gaat de 
controle uit van jouw PC. Met 'IP-Access' krijg je meer mogelijkheden
om het Internet te benutten. 'Slip-Access' en 'PPP-access' zijn vormen van
'IP-Access'.
<p>We geven misschien beter een voorbeeld uit de praktijk om dit 
duidelijker te maken. Stel je wil via FTP een bestand binnenhalen. 
Met 'Shell-Access' start je het FTP-programma op onze server op en haal je 
het betreffende bestand, dat ergens op een andere Internet-server staat
binnen op onze server. Hierna dien je het bestand nog eens vanuit je
home directory op KnoopPunt naar je eigen PC te transporteren. Werk je
met 'IP-Access' dan kan je met een gebruiksvriendelijk programma
het bestand rechtstreeks bij jou binnenhalen. 

<p><b>Ik haat Trumpet Winsock, ik haat Trumpet Winsock,
ik haat Trumpet Winsock, geef mij een alternatief!</b>

<p>Tja, we kunnen het ons wel voorstellen.
<p>Vooreerst de volgende opmerkingen, je kunt ook gewoon
aan de slag via een <a href="#shell">shell</a>. Dan kan je met de gekende 
communicatieprogramma's als Telix,
Procomm, Comit, ... op onze server FTP'en,
<a href="#lynx">Lynx</a> gebruiken,
met <a href="#pine">Pine</a> je mail lezen en verzenden, en via
<a href="#tin">Tin</a> je nieuws lezen. Het is
omslachtiger werken in een shell, maar sommige gebruikers houden er nu
eenmaal van. En we begrijpen wel waarom! Dit is het
alternatief voor hen die verlangen naar de goede oude tijd (het BBS).
<p>Er zijn ook de commerci&euml;le pakketten als
Chameleon, Internet in a Box (van CompuServe), maar daar ga je
centen voor betalen.
<p>Bij KnoopPunt wordt ook gezocht naar alternatieven maar
voorlopig houden we het hier bij Trumpet Winsock 2.1.    
Suggesties zijn welkom!
<p>Hou er rekening mee dat er ook software is die enkel Slip ondersteunt, en
waarmee je dus geen PPP-link kunt opzetten!
Bijv. onder <i>OS/2 Warp</i> kun je geen PPP-link opzetten, wel Slip.
<p>Voor de gebruikers die eerder toevallig op deze vraag beland zijn,
het merendeel van de gebruikers hebben geen problemen met Trumpet,
er zijn nu eenmaal van die hardnekkige gevallen (nee; computers, niet
gebruikers) waar het maar niet lukt. Maak je dus geen zorgen.

                
<p><a name="cc"><b>Wat is een 'Carbon Copy'</b></a>
<p>We zitten dus in de afdeling 'Mail'. In welk postprogramma je
ook werkt, op 
een bepaald ogenblik dien je altijd de hoofding in te vullen. Naast de 
geadresseerde ('TO') en het 
onderwerp ('SUBJECT') kan je ook 'CC' invullen. Dit laatste betekent gewoon
dat een bepaalde geadresseerde (of bepaalde geadresseerden) een kopie van 
het bericht krijgen. Hier vul je dus een e-mail-adres in. Soms 
krijg je ook de mogelijkheid tot een <i>Blind Carbon Copy</i> ('BCC'). Als je dit
invult, weten de andere geadresseerden niet wie
nog een kopie heeft gekregen. 

<p><a name="sig"><b>Hoe maak ik een 'signature' aan?</b></a>
<p>Vooreerst een <i>signature</i> is de handtekening onder je e-mail-bericht. 
Eenmaal je die hebt gemaakt, wordt die telkens mee gezonden na iedere bericht
dat je verzendt. In je 'signature' vermeld je dus zaken als je e-mail-adres,
telefoonnummers, de lokatie van je home page, ... en eventueel 
'bijkomstigheden' als een citaat van je favoriete filosoof, 'ascii-art', ...
<p>De 'sig' of 'signature' maak je in het mailprogramma
waarin je verstuurt. Hier zullen we proberen uit te liggen
hoe je een 'signature file' aanmaakt in Eudora en in Pine:
<p>Eudora
<ul>
<li>Selecteer <i>Window</i> in de menu-balk
<li>Selecteer <i>Signature</i>
<li>Bewerk het bestand en sluit af.
<li>Eudora zal je vragen of je het bestand wil opslaan (<i>Save</i>)
of niet (<i>Discard</i>).
</ul>
<p>Belangrijk in Eudora: wil je voor een bepaald bericht de 'signature' 
niet mee verzenden, dan kan je dit door bij het maken van een 
bericht <i>'None'</i> te selecteren (op de plaats in de menu-balk) 
waar je <i>'Signature'</i> ziet staan.
<p>Pine
<ul>
<li>Je gaat in een 'shell' en tikt <code>pine[return]</code> in. 
<li>In het menu selecteer je <i>Set-up</i>.
<li>Nu selecteer je '<tt>C</tt>onfigure'.
<li>Wil je de signature telkens aan het eind van je bericht zien
dan kies je <i>'signature-at-bottom'</i>, en je tik een <code>x</code> 
<i>(Set/Unset)</i> in.
<li>Je verlaat het menu (<code>E</code>), en je verlaat Pine.
<li>Je tikt <code>pico -w .signature [return]</code> in en je maakt het
signature-bestand (Pico is een Unix-editor).
<li>Ben je er klaar mee kies je <code>[control]x</code> en 
ben je tevreden over het resultaat tik je op <code>Y</code>
</ul>
<p>Niet zo makkelijk denk je; inderdaad, maar zoals eerder gesteld, is 
Pine is niet meteen een makkelijk mailprogramma.
<p>Tip voor gevorderden: je kunt de sig-file een zelfgekozen naam geven, 
en maken dat hij telkens zichtbaar is wanneer je de bestanden in je home
directory opvraagt. Dus: in
<i>Set-up</i> kies je <code>C</code> en ga je op de plaats waar het
pad naar de <code>.signature</code>file vermeld staat, een andere bestandsnaam
intikken. Je plaatst dat nieuwe bestand in je home directory door het te 
maken met Pico.  

<p><b>Wat is het verschil tussen 'Mail' en 'News'?</b>
<p>Kort uitgelegd: Mail heeft als bestemmeling(en) alle e-mail-adressen die
jij in de hoofding van het bericht hebt opgegeven.
<p>Nieuws heeft als bestemming alle personen die zich geabonneerd hebben
op de nieuwsconferentie waarin je gepost hebt.
<p>Ook wat programmatuur betreft, worden mail en news meestal apart 
behandeld. 
Concreet wat de KnoopPunt-software betreft: een mailbericht kun je via 
Eudora of Pine gaan verzenden; een nieuwsbericht verzend je via
Trumpet Newsreader of Tin.
<p><b>Hoelang doet mijn mail erover om z'n bestemming te bereiken?</b>
<p>Je bericht vertrekt onmiddellijk nadat je het op de
KnoopPunt-server hebt verzonden. Heeft de geadresseerde een Internet-account
dan komt je mail quasi onmiddellijk aan.
<p>Let wel: Er zijn ook andere
datacommunicatienetwerken. Voor wie post naar Afrika en
Latijns-Amerika verzendt, is dat belangrijk. Ook in Belgi&euml; werken
veel mensen met Fidonet en UUCP-connecties en niet met Internet. Vanuit 
KnoopPunt heb je een goede connectiviteit met die gebruikers. Alleen de
post komt pas toe wanneer de systemen van de bestemmeling hun post gaan 
afhalen en daar kan je niet altijd een schema in terugvinden. 
<p>Ook belangrijk is het volgende: als je bestemmeling z'n mail niet gaat
afhalen bij z'n provider dan kunnen wij daar niet aan doen. 
Als ik jou een brief stuur en je leegt nooit je brievenbus, 
dan moet ik de eerste plaats kwaad zijn op jou en niet op de postbode.
<p><b>Ik heb ergens gehoord, dat het mogelijk is via e-mail een fax 
te verzenden. Kan dat bij KnoopPunt?</b>
<p>Deze vraag krijgen we de laatste tijd meer en meer.
<p>Het antwoord is kort: Nee.
<p>Waarom? Indien KnoopPunt een faxserver zou installeren ten behoeve van 
z'n gebruikers, dan betekent dit dat een e-mail die verzonden wordt
en bedoeld is
als fax vanuit de lokatie van KnoopPunt, naar het opgegeven adres 
verzonden 
wordt. Het heeft voor ons echter geen zin om bijv. faxen te versturen voor 
een Belgische NGO naar pakweg Zimbabwe. Dus moet er een of andere afspraak zijn met 
andere providers, in het laatste voorbeeld ergens in Afrika, liefst in Zimbabwe
zelf. Momenteel onderhandelen we met 
<a href="#apc">APC</a> over de mogelijkheden. En indien de
voorstellen interessant zijn, dan komt het er zeker.
<p>Op het Net zelf kan je ook pages terugvinden waar dit zogezegd gratis kan, het 
gaat hier over een gesponsord project en de zekerheid dat je fax aankomt is
niet honderd procent.
<p>Hou er rekening mee dat providers die faxen versturen voor hun gebruikers dit niet 
gratis doen. De kost is inderdaad lager dan bij het gewoon versturen van een fax, maar
er wordt aangerekend! 

<p>
<b>Ik heb problemen bij het inbellen: op het ogenblik dat het script wacht op een
IP-nummer blijft de zaak hangen en kan ik niets anders doen dan ophangen
(bye) en herbeginnen. En tijdens een sessie wordt de verbinding plotseling verbroken. Er wordt dan
gewoon neergelegd.</b>

<p>Je wijst erop dat het probleem zich enkel voordoet bij
IP-verbindingen. De andere toepassingen die je noemt zijn echter op
de volgende punten verschillend: 
<ul>
<li>Meestal draait zo een toepassing alleen, zonder dat er andere 
toepassingen draaien. Bij werken met Internet zijn er minstens 2 
programma's aktief, het programma dat het IP-protocol en de communicatie 
onderhoudt en de toepassing: Netscape of Eudora.

<li>Andere toepassingen werken hun procedure stap voor stap af zonder 
veel tussenkomst van de gebruiker, bij het ingeven van gegevens in een 
bankprogramma bijv. staat de communicatie als het ware stil... 
<br>
Bij IP-toepassingen (vooral in Netscape) is er continu een stroom van
gegevens die over de lijn gaat. Elke tekst, elk beeld dat verschijnt is
een bestand, vele malen groter dat de minimale gegevens die ingetikt worden 
bij interactief gebruik gebaseerd op afzonderlijke tekens. Dit soort 
programma's ligt lekker bij asynchrone communicatie (byte per byte). De 
protocols voor Internet zijn echter ontworpen met synchrone communicatie 
in het achterhoofd. V36 dat gebruikt wordt op 64 Kb huurlijnen is 
synchrone transmissie.
 
<li>Gewone telefoonlijnen hebben maar een bruikbare bandbreedte van 300 Hz 
tot 3000 Hz. Daarbinnen worden momenteel acrobatische frequentie-technieken 
gebruikt om de snelheid te kunnen opdrijven.
<br>
In feite ontmoeten we hier dezelfde problemen die mensen vroeger al hadden
bij uploads en downloads. Er zijn toen protocols ontwikkeld zoals Z-modem
die het mogelijk maakten een bestand toch binnen te halen wanneer door 
storing alles in war liep, zelfs wanneer de verbinding
verbroken werd, en de gebruiker in staat stelden terug aan te pikken
(crash recovery). Softwarematige crash recovery en/of foutcorrectie zoals 
bij Z-modem is hier afwezig. Men moet sowieso terugvallen op the hardware 
flowcontrol van de modems.

<li>Bij Internet zit je meestal niet direct te communiceren met je host, 
maar communiceer je via jouw host met een nog ander systeem. Er kunnen 
een pak tussenligende stations zijn (routers). Je kan dat checken door 
eens het commando <code>traceroute SYSTEEMNAAM</code> in te tikken in de shell. Geef 
bijvoorbeeld eens het commando <code>traceroute gn.apc.org</code>

<p>Op het moment dat je op jouw muis klikt, verwacht je dat het systeem 
reageert, zoals dat het geval is als je werkt in WP of Excel.
Muisklikken zetten een ingewikkelde procedure in beweging waarbij meestal
een bestand wordt opgezonden van soms meerdere kB. IP-toepassingen zijn
event-driven, een klik op de muis veroorzaakt een transfer ...
<br>
Gebruikers zitten dan ongeduldig te wachten tot de gegevens binnenkomen.
Op dat moment is de modem druk bezig met het in beslag nemen van de
processor. Gebruikers klikken dan nog maar eens omdat ze geen direct
resultaat zien. Op een bepaald moment weet de processor niet waar eerst
springen. Men kan tenslotte zolang op de muis blijven drukken waardoor de
modem zijn data niet meer kan afgeven aan de processor en er dataoverflow 
plaatsgrijpt. Hierdoor zal ofwel het protocol in de war gestuurd worden, 
d.w.z. er is geen IP-link meer tussen jouw computer en de host, ook al ligt 
de lijn niet dicht, ofwel kan het ook zijn dat de modem het opgeeft 
doordat hij te gevoelig is voor fouten...
</ul>


<p><b>Ik vind die software die KnoopPunt aan ons doorspeelt maar rommel. Ik wil 
betere programma's. Wat doe ik?</b>
<p>De programmatuur die KnoopPunt aan z'n gebruikers doorspeelt
is Shareware software, die door de gebruikers niet geregisteerd dient te
worden. Van de meeste van deze programma's is ook een commerci&euml;le versie te 
verkrijgen. Wie die versies wil, zal er ook voor moeten betalen. En dan
is het nog niet gezegd dat 1/ de Support van de distributeurs optimaal is en
2/ dat het hier de 'ultieme versies' betreft.

<p><b>Een vriend van mij heeft een computervirus in z'n mailbox gekregen, bij
het openen van z'n mail liep z'n computer vast.</b>
<p>Zeg tegen die vriend dat hij een flauwerik is. Ten eerste DATA
kunnnen geen computervirussen bevatten, programma's wel. Dus neem nu nog
aan dat iemand een mail naar je verstuurt, met een programma, dan moet dit
programma door jou gedecodeerd en opgestart worden, want een mail bevat 
alleen data. 
<p>Dus de grap die we al twintig keer in nieuwsconferenties 
zijn tegengekomen, dat er een mailbericht de ronde doet dat bij openklikken
een virus op je harde schijf zet, is pure lulkoek. 
<p>Ga je software gaan FTP'en dan moet je natuurlijk de betreffende
programma's eerst scannen met een anti-virusprogramma. Dat doe je trouwens
beter met alle vreemde software die je op je computer wilt loslaten. Er 
worden bovendien veel meer virussen verspreid via 'piraten-software' dan via
Internet. 

<p><a name="apc"><b>KnoopPunt verspreidt ook 
<a href="/ned/nieuws/index.html"><i>'APC-nieuws'</i></a>, 
wat is het verschil met
het nieuws dat op Internet verspreid wordt?</b></a>
<p>Om het kort uit te leggen: APC (The Association for Progressive 
Communications) is een mondiale organisatie die een twintigtal leden heeft
over de gehele wereld. Deze en een aantal partners verpreiden een 
700-tal nieuwsconferenties over de systemen van de leden en de partners.
<p>Het nieuws wordt dus exclusief over deze systemen verspreid en is enkel te
verkrijgen bij deze systemen. Voor Belgi&euml; is dit KnoopPunt, die Full Member is
van APC. 
<p>Je kunt gerust stellen dat de kwaliteit van de APC-nieuwsgroepen
stukken hoger is dan de Usenetgroepen. Jij kunt actief participeren als
KnoopPunt-gebruiker door te posten in de APC-nieuwsgroepen, want het
APC-nieuws wordt in de eerste plaats geleverd door de gebruikers van
APC-systemen.
<p>Wil je meer uitleg over APC dan kun je best eens gaan neuzen in hun 
<a href="http://www.igc.org/apc">home page</a>. 
<p><b>Ik lees mijn nieuws bij KnoopPunt, maar ik merk dat een aantal
nieuwsgroepen niet op het systeem staan. Toch wil ik die lezen!</b>
<p>Het antwoord is eenvoudig: Je stuurt een mail naar Support met
daarin de exacte naam van de betreffende conferentie. Liefst schrijf
je er nog bij of het een Usenet- of een APC-conferentie betreft.
<p>Na een tijdje zul je merken dat de betreffende conferentie op ons
systeem staat. Let wel: sommige conferenties kunnen wij niet binnenhalen om
tal van redenen. 
<p>Werk je in een <a href="#shell">shell</a> dan kan je gebruik maken 
van <code>rtin</code>. Door <code>rtin</code> in te tikken na de prompt kom je terecht op 
een nieuwsserver waar je zo'n 3400 Usenet-nieuwsgroepen kan gaan lezen.

<p><b>Misschien had ik deze vraag beter aan de
<a href="mailto: webmaster@knooppunt.be">Webmaster</a> gesteld, maar
kom ... Ik zou graag Netscape laten draaien terwijl ik GEEN connectie heb
met Internet, kwestie van mijn Homepage eens vooraf te bekijken.</b>

<p>Geen probleem, ons werk overlapt zich nu eenmaal. En Webmaster krijgt al
te veel leuke jobs.
<p>We geven drie mogelijkheden: <br>
<ul>
<li>Ofwel start je Trumpet Winsock op en klik je op <i>Manual Login</i>
in het <i>Dialler</i>-menu;
waarna je het volgende commando intikt: <code>at&C0</code> (dat laatste
teken was een nul). Minimaliseer het venster van Trumpet en start Netscape op.
<li>Gecompliceerder en gevaarlijker: Er bestaat een file <code>mozock.dll</code>,
die je in de plaats van <code>winsock.dll</code> in de Netscape-directory
moet plaatsen, om Netscape te 'misleiden'. Je hernoemt die file in
<code>winsock.dll</code>, en je kan aan de slag (wel de ouwe
<code>winsock.dll</code> eerst ergens anders plaatsen, want je hebt hem nog
nodig om 'echt' op het Net te gaan!) 
Die <a href="ftp://ftp.knooppunt.be/pub/software/mozock.dll">
mozock.dll</a> kun je hier gaan FTP'en.
<br>Bij dit laatste kunnen nog complicaties voorkomen, als er ergens
anders nog zo'n <code>winsock.dll</code> staat.
<li>Je kunt ook proberen in te loggen, Netscape opstarten,
dan weer uitloggen, daarna je communicatieprogramma verkleinen
(Trumpet dus)
en hopen dat Netscape blijft draaien. Dit laatste lijkt ons echter te
omslachtig.

<a name="subject"><h3>Subjectieve woordenlijst van Support</h3></a>
<p>Orwell had geen betere illustratie kunnen vinden voor z'n 'Newspeak'
dan op Internet. Om de haverklap krijg je woorden om je oren geslingerd,
meestal uit het Engels (Amerikaans!) afgeleid, waarvan je denkt 'waar
halen ze het uit'. Om deze pagina af te sluiten heeft Support je een lijstje
waar hij zijn persoonlijke uiterst subjectieve commentaren bij geeft.

<dl>
<dt><b>Ascii-art</b>:
<dd>Kunst gemaakt met de tekens waarover je beschikt op je toetsenbord
en die ondersteund worden via e-mail. In iedere middelbare school heeft
de leraar 'typen' wel een modelstudent, die ter bevordering van 
het intikken van saaie teksten, het goede voorbeeld gaf door een Mona Lisa
in te tikken op z'n machine. Leraars zijn erg trots op dit soort
leerlingen, andere leerlingen vinden het een uitslover.
<dt><b>Bounce</b>:
<dd>Wanneer je een mail verstuurt en plots duikt die weer op in je mailbox,
dan heb je een 'Bounce'. De redenen hiervoor zijn verschillend van aard. Veelal betreft het een fout adres. Maar soms gebeurd het ook 
dat een systeem plat ligt waardoor je mail niet doorgestuurd wordt. Best heel 
goed de header bestuderen van de teruggekeerde mail. Daarin kun je gegevens 
terugvinden als 'no such user', waardoor je dan weet dat je een fout
adres hebt ingegeven. Bij systemen die platliggen, kun je altijd proberen
de mail nogmaals op te sturen. Wanneer een server plat ligt kun je ervan 
uitgaan dat met man en macht gewerkt wordt om het systeem weer draaiende te
krijgen.
<dt><b>Chatten</b>
<dd>Hoogst tijdrovend fenomeen dat eruit bestaat vanachter je scherm
online te 'talken' (nog zo'n woord) met wildvreemden op een IRC-kanaal.
Het is tijdrovend, werkt verslavend en brengt je niets bij behalve het
besef dat Internet duur kan zijn. Meestal zit achter iedere 'praatgroep'
een censor die meeleest en
je eruit gooit als je het te bont maakt. Het fenomeen deed
ons een tijdje overwegen onze naam te veranderen in 'KnoopPunt Informatie
en Kommunicatie met Inhoud Kollektief', maar de taalpuristen onder ons
zagen dit niet echt zitten.
<dt><b>Crossposting</b>:
<dd>Over het algemeen zijn we hier niet zo happig op dit verschijnsel. Je
doet aan 'Crossposting' vanaf het ogenblik dat je een bericht in meerdere
conferenties gaat droppen. Dit heeft heel vaak als gevolg dat je in 
Nieuwsconferenties berichten kunt lezen die daar niet thuishoren. Post 
berichten dus zeer selectief en gericht, het resultaat zal trouwens
hoger zijn dan bij 'Crossposting'.

<dt><b>Cyberspace</b>:
<dd>Term die ooit gelanceerd werd door een science fiction schrijver, 
een zeker Gibson als we ons niet vergissen. Het betreft een 'virtuele 
ruimte' waarmee dan Internet bedoeld wordt.
'Virtual Space' is trouwens niet hetzelfde als 'Virtual Reality', het
speelgoed van gestoorde geleerden.  

<dt><b>Emoticon</b>: 
<dd>Daar het 'face to face'-contact op Internet niet bestaat gaan mensen
in hun mail en nieuwsberichten hun emoties uitdrukken door het gebruik van
'emoticons'. Een grap wordt bijv. vergezeld van de volgende tekens <tt>:-)</tt> 

<dt><b>Flamen</b>:
<dd>Een 'Flame' is simpel uitgedrukt een scheldpartij. Het is een tactiek
die vooral gehanteerd wordt door mensen die het in hun dagelijks leven
moeilijk hebben om mensen iets recht in het gezicht te zeggen. Ze doen het
dan maar vanop een afstand, dus anoniem van achter een scherm, meestal met
een gebruikersnaam die hun ware identiteit niet verraadt. 'Flamen' is ook 
een van de redenen (naast 'Crossposten') waarom Usenet zo'n
vuilnisbak geworden is.

<dt><b>Junkmail</b>: 
<dd>Dit is alle mail die in je mailbox krijgt waar je niet om gevraagd hebt. En
Support heeft daar soms wel last van. Meestal betreft het reclame voor 
software waar je toch niets mee kunt aanvangen. 
Onze Webmaster wordt er soms groen van.

<dt><a href="#sig"><b>Mailsig</b></a>
<dd>Dit is de handtekening onder je mail en wordt bij iedere mail mee
opgestuurd.
Meestal beperken gebruikers zich tot het meedelen van enkele nuttige gegevens,
sommigen menen echter de wereld te moeten verblijden door hun
sig zo vol te laden met trivialiteiten en pogingen tot kunst, dat hun sig
in het merendeel van de gevallen langer is dan hun mail.

<dt><b>Netiquette</b>
<dd>Tja, er wordt verwacht van iedere gebruiker dat hij zijn manieren
gebruikt op het 'Net'. Vooral in nieuwsgroepen kun je wel eens 'gepakt'
worden omdat je een of andere regel hebt overtreden. Over een aantal 
afspraken kun je in deze page het een en ander lezen, andere afspraken 
ondervind je zelf wel al doende. Sommige Internet-gebruikers leggen een 
volgens ons een overdreven aandacht aan de dag voor dit soort zaken, 
over hen lees je meer onder 'Netpolitie'.

<dt><b>Netpolitie</b>
<dd>Men zegt wel eens: Internet is een anarchistisch netwerk. Veelal 
bedoelt men daarmee dat er weinig controle is op wat mensen verrichten, en
dat er weinig wetgeving is. Sommigen vinden dit OK, anderen willen meer
controle. Die anderen hebben dan ook vaak weinig kennis van het 'Net' zelf.
En er lopen nu eenmaal mensen rond die alles onder controle willen hebben. 
Ons lijkt het niks, pipo's die op onze vingers kijken of we onze manieren
wel houden.  

<dt><b>Newbie</b>:
<dd>Deze term wordt gegeven aan gebruikers die nieuw zijn op het 'Net'. 
Wij vinden het een nogal debiele betiteling die meestal gehanteerd wordt
door het soort hippe jongens die zelf met Internet begonnen zijn omdat ze
het gewoon zijn om iedere hype nauwlettend op te volgen. Laat je niet 
intimideren!

<dt><b>Zwart Gat</b>:
<dd>Term die bij KnoopPunt gehanteerd wordt om aan te duiden dat een
mail gewoon verdwenen is. Wij zijn er hier nogal trots op dat ondanks 
pannes en disk crashes nog geen mail in het beruchte 'zwarte gat' is
verdwenen.
