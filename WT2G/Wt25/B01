<H3>Foreman Testifies </H3>

<P>
Accused killer Rory Foreman took the witness stand today in his
own defense. Foreman is charged with the first degree murder of
his 25-year-old former girlfriend Joan Heimbecker March 30th,
1994 in her McMaster University residence. 
<P>
<I>Remembering his former girlfriend, Rory Foreman testified that
when Joan Heimbecker walked into a room, the whole room lit up
around her. &quot;She had that radiance. you couldn't hate her.
It was impossible.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>When Foreman went to Joan's McMaster University residence the
night of March 30th, 1994, it was to ask for a reconciliation.
Foreman testified: &quot;I just wanted her to face me with what
happened. I thought if she saw me, everything would change.&quot;
Instead, Foreman says Joan told him she didn't love him, and never
did, and she repulsed his attempt to hug her. Foreman said: &quot;I
felt like dirt after that... it made me feel like road-kill was
better than I was.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>Foreman left Joan's apartment, and when he came back, he was
carrying a sawn-off shotgun. Foreman's lawyer, Peter Bawden, asked:
&quot;what did you think you would do with the gun?&quot; Foreman
replied: &quot;she would have had to listen to me then... I was
going to scare her... have her sit there and think about everything.
I would torment her, same as she did to me.&quot; Bawden asked:
&quot;did you give her the impression you were going to kill her?&quot;
Foreman answered yes. </I>
<P>
<I>Bawden asked: &quot;what did you think was going to end it?&quot;
Foreman answered: &quot;I thought I was going to leave. just drop
the gun and walk out.&quot; But when one of Joan's room-mates
came to the apartment door, Foreman says he panicked. &quot;At
the same time someone screamed. I think it was Joan... I turned
around with the gun, and it went off.&quot; Bawden asked: &quot;are
you telling me it was an accident?&quot; Foreman answered: &quot;it
wasn't intended. I wasn't supposed to shoot anybody. It went off.
It didn't hit Joan. I was angry. I just snapped after that. The
next shot hit her in the leg. She was falling. I don't remember
the third or fourth shot. I remember as soon as she hit the floor
there was another shot that hit her in the neck.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>Just before he fired the final shot, Foreman says he became
aware of what he was doing, and pulled up the gun so the shot
hit the wall. He tearfully told the court: &quot;I didn't intend
anything. I was just angry. I lost control... just kept firing.
I couldn't stop myself until the last shot, and then it was too
late...&quot; I didn't know what I was doing. It was like... she
wasn't even human then&quot;.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>McIntyre Homicide </H3>

<P>
Halton Regional Police have reopened their investigation into
the death of an Oakville man twelve years ago. 
<P>
33-year-old William McIntyre was found in his home with a single
gunshot wound to his head. No one was ever charged but now police
say new information has led to the possibility of DNA testing
on substances found at the scene. 
<HR>

<H3>Cabbie Attacked </H3>

<P>
A Hamilton cab driver was mugged while walking home from work
overnight. 
<P>
Two men, one with a sawed off rifle, the other with a knife, forced
the cabbie down onto a sidewalk in central Hamilton, and rifled
through his pockets. Police are looking for two white men in their
late teens, both with baseball caps. One of the suspects was wearing
a black and white jacket. 
<HR>

<H3>Henderson Reaction </H3>

<P>
The Hamilton Wentworth Health Action Task Force is still under
fire by the medical community following the submission of it's
final report to the Regional District Health Council. 
<P>
The most controversial recommendation in that report is one that
calls for the closure of one acute care hospital in Hamilton.
The report doesn't name which one, but that hasn't stopped those
fearing the demise of their institution from taking to the streets...Jamie
West reports... 
<P>
<I>Several hundred doctors, nurses support staff and members of
the public rallied out front of Henderson General Hospital during
the noon hour to remind themselves and the public that they are
strong and won't go down quietly. </I>
<P>
<I>Although the Health Action Task Force has not specifically
earmarked the Henderson for closure, there is concern by staff,
especially since an earlier report suggested that St. Joseph's
Hospital take over the Henderson which serves not only Hamilton.</I>
<P>
<I>Another report by the city's hospital CEO's under the moniker
the Academic Health Care Network called for the Henderson to become
a scaled down urgent care centre specializing in cancer treatment
and major joint reconstruction surgery.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Tory Nomination </H3>

<P>
The Tories have named their candidate for the June 17th by-election
in Hamilton east. Angela Tomasic, a 35-year-old bank employee
will seek the seat left vacant by Sheila Copps' resignation. 
<P>
Tomasic's entry into the race brings the number of candidates
to six. Ian Dovey reports. 
<P>
<I>It was Angela Tomasic's night and no one was going to ruin
it, not even Andy Sweck the Reform Party candidate who made appearance
that some Tories found daring and desperate. </I>
<P>
<I>Tomasic's nomination was contested by Quincy Morgan, the president
of an OPSEU local. </I>
<P>
<I>Tomasic ran against David Christopherson in Hamilton centre
in the last provincial election. It was an election she lost but
not by much. Tomasic hopes her popularity carries over into the
June 17th election. </I>
<P>
<I>Elsie Wayne, the other half of the federal Tories was the guest
speaker.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Taro Aftermath </H3>

<P>
City council in Stoney Creek will not request an environmental
assessment hearing into a proposed industrial waste dump site.

<P>
But the Hamilton Region Conservation Authority has requested the
review. It's now up to environment &amp; energy minister Brenda
Elliott. Anthony Pooley reports. 
<P>
<I>Like the community it represents, Stoney Creek city council
is sharply divided on the Taro dump issue. Last night, after a
protracted and sometimes acrimonious debate, council tied on the
question of requesting an environmental assessment hearing into
the industrial waste dump site proposal. That means their original
decision not to ask for a hearing stands. </I>
<P>
<I>But the Hamilton Region Conservation Authority... almost as
sharply divided... voted last week to request a hearing. But Harry
Dahme, legal counsel for a community study group that reviewed
all of the technical data both for and against conversion of the
Taro aggregates east quarry, says that the issues have already
been examined to death. </I>
<P>
<I>The ball is now squarely in the court of environment and energy
minister Brenda Elliot. She had allowed until this Friday for
submissions on the question of whether a hearing should be held.
</I>
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
For the third consecutive day, the value of Canadian stocks in
Toronto climbed to record highs. 
<P>
Interest rates in bond markets are dropping. 
<P>
Bay Street analysts are expecting the rally to continue into the
summer.

<H3>Foreman-Day 13 </H3>

<P>
The man accused of the shotgun slaying of a McMaster University
graduate student is expected to take the stand in his own defence
tomorrow. 
<P>
Today, the crown rested its case against 25-year-old Rory Foreman,
who's on trial in Hamilton for first-degree murder. His ex-girlfriend,
25-year-old Joan Heimbecker, died of multiple gunshot wounds in
her McMaster University residence on March 30th, 1994. 
<P>
As Deborah Walker reports, the final three crown witnesses to
testify were Joan's best friend, another close friend, and a former
girlfriend of Rory Foreman's. 
<P>
<I>Val Percival and Joan Heimbecker became close friends while
working together in the summer of 1993. That fall, Joan moved
to Hamilton, and Val to Ottawa, to pursue their masters degrees,
but they kept in touch by mail. </I>
<P>
<I>In November Joan wrote: &quot;I'm still seeing Rory. I didn't
want to get emotionally involved with anyone, but I did ... I
enjoy being with him, he's mushy though... like kissing in public
and holding hands all the time, but I kinda like it.&quot; Three
months later, and exactly four weeks before she died, Joan sent
another letter to Val, saying she'd broken off her relationship
with Foreman to go out with a new boyfriend. Joan wrote: &quot;things
were (are) still a bit &quot;messy&quot; with Rory. He was not
happy. I felt bad because he's a sweetie and he's like a big teddy
bear. However we really didn't have that much in common.&quot;
</I>
<P>
<I>Around the same time, Rory Foreman was leaving notes at the
Kitchener home of his former girlfriend, Debbie McCorkindale.
In a March seventh note left on her windshield, Foreman wrote:
&quot;I care about you a lot and I may never see you again...
something bad happened and I wanted to talk to someone... I don't
know where to turn anymore.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>On March 29th, Debbie McCorkindale found another note, and
some flowers on her doorstep. Foreman wrote: &quot;I'm just writing
to say goodbye since this is probably the last time you will ever
hear from me. I'm almost 90 % positive I won't be back... I will
always care about you and I hope you have a good life.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>McCorkindale says she tried unsuccessfully to telephone Foreman
to find out what the letter was about. Twenty-four hours later,
Joan Heimbecker was dead.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>DNA Hamilton Lab </H3>

<P>
In many murder trials and sexual assault cases DNA evidence has
become an essential part of the trial. In response to the demand
for DNA tests, Ontario's Centre for Forensic Science is doubling
the size of its DNA crime lab. But even with the hiring of 25
extra staff, the centre will still have to send extra work out
to private labs. Kathy Renwald visited a private facility in Hamilton.

<P>
<I>John Waye looks at the DNA profile that will settle a paternity
suit. Its the kind of work his Ident Lab gets from the Center
for Forensic Science. </I>
<P>
<I>The center in Toronto is doubling the size of its DNA crime
lab. That will help it clear a backlog of work that in the past
has involved high profile cases including Paul Bernardo and Guy
Paul Morin. </I>
<P>
<I>From his Hamilton lab John Waye provides DNA testing and consulting.
Even though the wait for DNA test results from the Centre for
Forensic Science is up to 5 months ... Waye doesn't see that prompting
the start up of many private labs. The newest equipment for DNA
testing is 210 thousand dollars ...a prohibitive price for small
labs. But the demand will continue to increase according to Waye
..who says DNA evidence is vital in murder and sexual assault
cases.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>OMA-First </H3>

<P>
The Ontario Medical Association says healthcare in Ontario is
nearing a crisis. 
<P>
At news conferences held across the province today doctors say
budget cutting by the Harris government is putting patients at
risk. The OMA is inviting people to voice their concerns about
the future of medical care and they've launched a series of radio
and television ads to encourage people to write their MP's. 
<P>
Doctor's say the public must decide the priority of medical services
in Ontario not just doctors and medical economists. 
<HR>

<H3>Tsubouchi Dundas </H3>

<P>
Depending upon whom one talks to, the Harris government is either
on the right track or moving too far too fast, creating a lot
of pain along the way. It is, of course, up to members of the
cabinet to try and convince Ontarians of the former. 
<P>
Today... it was the turn of community and social services minister
David Tsubouchi... at a Rotary Club luncheon in Dundas. Channel
11's Anthony Pooley was there. 
<P>
<I>Typically, after a government brings down a budget, cabinet
members are temporarily turned into salesmen. It's up to them
to hit the rubber chicken circuit and preach their particular
economic gospel. And that's what community and social services
minister David Tsubouchi did in Dundas today... </I>
<P>
<I>Before a luncheon meeting of the Rotary Club... and he was
on friendly and affluent turf at the Dundas Valley Golf and Curling
Club. He told Rotarians... many of whom are small business people
... of the interconnection among the provincial tax cut, government
cost-cutting and job creation, sticking to the party line that
the first two lead to the last one... as well as deficit reduction
toward a balanced budget by the turn of the century. </I>
<P>
<I>But where are the 725,000 new jobs promised during the election
campaign? one Rotarian asks. And later he told reporters that
Workfare... a plan to get welfare recipients who can to work for
their monthly stipends... is coming... hinting that Hamilton could
be one of the initial test communities.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Burlington Tourism</H3>

<P>
The Burlington Visitor and Convention Bureau launched an aggressive
campaign to attract tourists today... complete with mascots...
at Spencer Smith Park. 
<P>
Attractions in Burlington may be more of a secret than anyone
would like them to be... hence a promotion campaign. The bureau
is building its push with the city's museum. 
<HR>

<H3>Projects Completed </H3>

<P>
The city of Niagara Falls is celebrating the completion of 7.6
million dollars worth of infrastructure projects...28 in all,
including a 2.1 million dollar storm and sanitary sewer on Victoria
Street, improvements and reconstruction of roads, sidewalks and
watermains, upgrade to recreation facilities including Niagara
Falls Memorial Arena; and roof repairs to the public library.

<P>
The projects completed under a municipal, provincial and federal
partnership, also created the equivalent of more than a thousand
year-long jobs. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Some encouraging economic information from the United States injected
more confidence into financial markets. 
<P>
New evidence suggests tame inflation in the United States will
help to keep American and Canadian interest rates stable. 
<P>
Markets reacted with a decline in interest rates and another big
gain in stocks. Share prices in Toronto hit new record highs.

<H3>Health Final</H3>

<P>
Reduce the number of acute care hospitals in Hamilton Wentworth
from four to three. Period. No mention of which hospitals. That's
the bottom line of the Health Action Task Force's final draft
of recommendations being submitted to the District Health Council.

<P>
When &quot;Our Health Our Future&quot; was released in March it
created a huge public outcry, especially over its recommendation
to close St. Joseph's Hospital. The final draft is now in the
hands of the Regional District Health Council for approval, before
it makes it's way to the Ministry of Health. As Jamie west reports,
it appears the controversy is far from over. 
<P>
<I>That was Hamilton Wentworth Health Action Task Force chair
Ray Johnson March 4th. On the release of the report that among
other things recommended the closure of St. Joseph's Hospital
downtown Hamilton in favour of moving it to the building now occupied
by Henderson General. A recommendation that was widely criticized
by health care workers, hospital CEO's and the general public.
</I>
<P>
<I>The outcry was so loud that the District Health Council extended
it's period for public response by two weeks. And respond they
did...the CEO's of Hamilton's hospitals formed a united front
under the name &quot;The Academic Health Care Network.&quot; Their
recommendations... save St. Joes and turn the Henderson into an
urgent care hospital with a focus on cancer and major joint reconstruction.
</I>
<P>
<I>The document even seemed to catch the task force chairman's
eye. But then the doctors of the Hamilton Civic Hospitals banded
together to release their own report, one critical of the lack
of attention being paid to patient care.</I>
<P>
<I>In all the task force heard from nearly 50-thousand people
by phone, fax, and mail. Nearly 85-thousand signed petitions to
save St. Joseph's. But after two and half months, the task force
is still recommending that one hospital close it's doors.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
A volatile day on financial markets finished in positive territory.
Renewed fears over another Quebec referendum caused an early devaluation
of the dollar. 
<P>
The Canadian currency finished the day stronger while the value
of stocks in Toronto and new York climbed to records highs. 
<HR>

<H3>Student Employment </H3>

<P>
In Burlington today... the Canada Employment Centre for Students
officially opened its doors... as it tries to find summer jobs
for those who go back to school in the fall. 
<P>
Their objective this summer... 900 placements. Last year, they
found jobs for 875 students seeking summer work. New this year...
computer software to help clients come up with a resume... now
required by most prospective employers. 
<HR>

<H3>Foreman 12 </H3>

<P>
A Brantford woman testified today she watched Rory Foreman pull
a package from the trunk of a car, less than a half-hour before
a McMaster University student was shot to death. Foreman is charged
with first-degree murder in the 1994 shotgun slaying of his ex-girlfriend,
Joan Heimbecker. Deborah Walker is covering the trial in Hamilton.

<P>
<I>Joan Heimbecker was hit by four shotgun blasts in her on-campus
residence just before ten o'clock, the night of March 30th, 1994.
Less than a half-hour earlier, Barb Hazzard was parked in this
McMaster University parking lot, waiting to pick up her daughter,
when she saw a tall black man striding towards her. Hazzard identified
the man as Rory Foreman. </I>
<P>
<I>She testified... &quot;he had on a long coat and it was flapping
behind him as he was walking briskly.&quot; Hazzard says Foreman
walked to a blue Taurus parked two spaces away from her and...
&quot;...opened the trunk. His hand reached in and took out a
package.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>Barb Hazzard told the court the car's trunk was full of things,
but Foreman found the item he was looking for easily. It was wrapped
in a garbage bag, with twine or tape wound around it in two places.
After closing the trunk, Hazzard says Foreman walked to the driver's
side, with the package clutched to his stomach. He opened the
door, put the package inside, got in himself and drove off. </I>
<P>
<I>Around the same time, engineering student Ed Palmer watched
a blue Taurus pull in right behind him in the circular driveway
outside Bates Residence, where Joan Heimbecker lived. Palmer went
into bates for a few minutes, then left again. as he walked to
his car, he saw a tall black man standing by the opened door of
the Taurus, a man he identified in court as Rory Foreman. Less
than a half hour later, Joan Heimbecker lay dying in a pool of
blood in her second floor apartment at Bates. </I>
<P>
<I>In other testimony, a forensic document expert told the court
she examined a driver's license, birth certificate, and Conestoga
college student card recovered when Rory Foreman surrendered to
police in Colorado. On all the documents, Christine Warias says
someone used a pen to change the &quot;F's&quot; to &quot;E's&quot;,
in an unsophisticated attempt to make &quot;Foreman&quot; look
like &quot;Eoreman&quot;. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Policing Centre </H3>

<P>
Community based policing in Hamilton took another step forward
today. The Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police Service officially
opened its third store front centre... this one at Centre Mall.

<P>
It was also the kick-off to police week... as well as the new
highway help program... in which motorists can buy inexpensive
signs asking passers-by to call police in the event of unexpected
car trouble. 
<HR>

<H3>Police Cuts </H3>

<P>
If you get stopped for a boating violation on Hamilton Harbour
this summer you may be dealing with a cop from Hamilton, Halton
or the RCMP. As Kathy Renwald reports, Hamilton's Police Marine
unit may be reorganized to save money and step up efficiency.
The change would create a joint forces police team on the water.

<P>
<I>It costs about 480 thousand dollars a year for the Hamilton
Wentworth Regional Police to operate its marine unit. Both police
administration and regional politicians are looking for ways to
trim that cost while delivering the same amount of policing. </I>
<P>
<I>Hamilton's Police Services Board should get a report by the
end of this week that proposes a sharing of Harbour policing between
Hamilton and Halton forces and the RCMP. Deputy chief Ken Robertson
says that could even mean officers from Hamilton and Halton sharing
the same patrol boat. </I>
<P>
<I>The chairman of the Police Services Board endorses the potential
efficiency. A joint police effort between Hamilton Halton and
RCMP could reduce duplication and some equipment costs associated
with the marine units. Regional police in Hamilton are even looking
at transferring winter rescues on the water to the fire department.
</I>
<P>
<I>If the proposed joint forces approach to policing on Hamilton
Harbour and the lakefront is approved ..changes could be underway
by June,</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Policing Seniors </H3>

<P>
...and police in Hamilton also paid a visit to seniors at the
Sackville Hill Recreation Centre today... where this year's police
week theme &quot;Partners in Community Safety&quot; was evident.

<P>
It was a seminar designed to address the concern for the victimization
of the elderly in our community. Police were offering crime prevention
advice related to personal safety, telemarketing scams and con
artists. Other services like Hamilton ambulance and the Hamilton
and Dundas fire department were also there... as well as the elder
abuse task force and several other volunteer organizations.

<H3>WHO - Ivermectin</H3>

<P>
The World Health Organization has turned its attention on a home
for the aged in Dundas, where an unusually high number of residents
died after taking a drug considered perfectly safe. 
<P>
The drug is called Ivermectin. It has been used extensively, and
successfully since the 1970's by agencies like the WHO, to treat
tropical parasitic diseases. Last November, it was administered
to forty-seven patients at Wentworth Lodge in Dundas. As Deborah
walker reports, fourteen of them died within five months of taking
the drug. 
<P>
<I>it started last June, with a scabies outbreak among residents
of Wentworth Lodge in Dundas. Months of conventional treatment
failed to rid residents of the irritating, itchy rash. In desperation,
staff turned to a consultant, who recommended Ivermectin. Because
the drug is not approved for use in Canada, Wentworth Lodge had
to apply to the Federal Health Protection branch for permission
to use it. </I>
<P>
<I>All forty-seven residents suffering from scabies took a single
dose of Ivermectin last November. Within five months, fourteen
of them had died, a death rate that's two-and-a-half times higher
than the rest of the Wentworth Lodge population. </I>
<P>
<I>Doctor Barkwell says there's nothing to indicate Ivermectin
caused the deaths, but right now, it's the only thing all fourteen
had in common. Doctor Barkwell has notified the coroner's office,
the health protection branch, and the drug's manufacturer. He
says it will take months of epidemiological research to determine
what role Ivermectin, or any other factor, played in the deaths
of the fourteen residents.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Clean Soils? </H3>

<P>
A company operating a soil cleaning business on the edge of Hamilton
Harbour has provoked both the Hamilton beach strip residents and
city council. As Kathy Renwald reports city council wants to force
Clean Soils Limited to move or close down. 
<P>
<I>Hamilton city and regional politicians are dogged by a decision
4 years ago not to oppose the start up of this waste processing
site on pier 26 in the east Harbour. </I>
<P>
<I>Clean Soils Ltd said they expected up to 90 per cent of their
petroleum contaminated soil to arrive by ship to. Then at the
Eastport site the soil would be heated to remove gas and oil.
The municipality regarded this as a marine use and did not object
to the facility. But so far the soil has arrived by land. And
the Hamilton Harbour Commission confirms no ships have delivered
to this site. </I>
<P>
<I>Now under pressure from beach strip residents who say the facility
is a nuisance the city wants Clean Soils out. Beach strip residents
delivered a petition to councilors about their concerns. </I>
<P>
<I>Today Clean Soils president Gordon Weis said the uncovered
pile is the treated soil. But the Ministry of the Environment
confirms Clean Soils Limited was fined last summer for violations
..and that the ministry has asked the company to voluntarily address
three concerns. Tarping of soil, stack emissions and storage of
soil. </I>
<P>
<I>But alderman Collins says there's not much the company can
do to change his mind. Clean Soils president Gordon Weis said
the company never indicated when they would start receiving their
contaminated soil by ship.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Copps Fundraiser </H3>

<P>
Located in Hamilton east, that story could well turn into an issue
in the June 17th by-election. Federal leader Alexa Mcdonough will
kick off the NDP campaign next Thursday, when the new democratic
candidate will be elected. 
<P>
And Sheila Copps got a boost to her re-election bid last night
when she was named Hamilton's political woman of the year at a
Hamilton Status of Women dinner. And at a Liberal fundraiser,
Copps was presented with a pair of boxing gloves, so she could
indeed come out fighting in next month's by-election. 
<HR>

<H3>Young Offender </H3>

<P>
A fifteen year old boy is in police custody after being charged
in what police describe as a reign of terror in east Hamilton.
Police were called after a 54-year old man was shot at several
times with a pellet gun. It was later determined that the boy
was a suspect in two separate sexual assaults on two 14 year old
girls. Furthermore after comparing notes with other officers,
police discovered the boy's fingerprints matched those found during
four break and enters at an east Hamilton apartment building.

<P>
The boy who cannot be identified under the Young Offenders Act
is facing several charges including sexual assault with a weapon,
forcible confinement, four counts of break and enter and a number
of weapons charges. 
<HR>

<H3>Biker Follow </H3>

<P>
And the latest now in what could become a biker reign of terror,
since Niagara police announced on Monday that they will hunt down
bikers and wipe the gangs out a number of incidents have occurred.
Lauran Sabourin has this update. 
<P>
<I>Early Tuesday morning a fire that arson investigators are calling
suspicious started on the back porch of a home rented by an Outlaws
gang member. Thirty three year old Jay Deming had lived at the
Allanport Road house for a few years. The fire spread to from
the porch to a back bedroom and gutted most of the inside. A rottweiller
who lived at the house was killed in the blaze. </I>
<P>
<I>Then later that day in a rural section of Port Colborne police
were alerted to a helicopter flying only a few feet off the ground
near a farmer's field. Three scruffy looking men were seen in
the area of concession two after the helicopter left. They got
into a car and drove off. </I>
<P>
<I>Meanwhile police are continuing to scour home and property
owned by Outlaws St. Catharines president Mario Parente. Parente
has fifty acres of land on Sodom road in Niagara falls. Police
have been there since Monday and have seized a number of items.
They've also seized weapons, ammunition and drugs. Cocaine and
marijuana with a street value in excess of 700 thousand dollars.
</I>
<P>
<I>With all of this evidence police say they will spend the next
several months building their case against Parente. While keeping
a watchful eye on the activities of gang members.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Missing Man </H3>

<P>
Hamilton Wentworth police are asking for the public's help in
locating a man who went missing yesterday. 
<P>
Gary Joseph Ziegler is twenty five years old, medium build, five
foot ten, a hundred and seventy pounds, light complexion, blonde
shoulder length hair, and blue eyes. He was last seen wearing
a black and red nylon jacket with black nylon pants, and grey
and white running shoes. 
<HR>

<H3>Cross Missing </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile a ground search by Halton Regional Police has turned
up no clues in the disappearance of an Oakville woman. 
<P>
27 year old Diane Cross is a teacher at St. Mildred Lightbourn
School in Oakville. She was wearing a dark green coat, a blue
and black tweed jacket and skirt, and white running shoes. Cross
is a diabetic, and it's not known if she has any medication with
her. 
<HR>

<H3>Halton Conflict </H3>

<P>
The taxpayers coalition in Burlington is preparing to take legal
action against several Halton board of education trustees. 
<P>
Coalition Education chair Frank Gue says the board is unable to
grasp quality and cost problems. He claims part of the inability
is paralysis caused by what he feels is a conflict of interest
through several trustees having close relationships with board
employees. 
<P>
A taxpayers coalition legal fund account has been opened. Taxpayers
may contribute at any Canada Trust branch in Halton. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
The leaders of Stelco and Dofasco today criticized the lack of
action by the federal government to deal with foreign companies
that dump cheap steel in Canada. Both of Hamilton's big steel
companies held their annual shareholder meetings today. Stelco
also announced the retirement of president Robert Milbourne.

<H3>Hamilton East </H3>

<P>
Less than 24 hours after a tearful resignation, the campaign in
on! It may have been a surprise to Sheila Copps but the resignation
of the deputy prime minister yesterday doesn't seem to have caught
campaign workers in Hamilton East flat-footed. 
<HR>

<H3>Harris - Hamilton </H3>

<P>
Ontario premier Mike Harris got a first hand look this afternoon
at what residents may be spending their proposed 30 per cent tax
break on. 
<P>
Harris toured the Stoney Creek Furniture showroom and no, he wasn't
there looking to rearrange his cabinet. He was at Stoney Creek
Furniture to hear about plans for a 3 million dollar expansion,
to begin in July. The expansion will add 30 new jobs, bringing
the total workforce to about one-hundred and 5. 
<P>
Premier Harris told employees he hopes more people will be buying
furniture when his 30 per cent provincial income tax break comes
into effect. 
<HR>

<H3>Foreman 6 </H3>

<P>
A McMaster University graduate student, wounded by four shotgun
blasts, showed no signs of life when ambulance attendants arrived
at her residence apartment. 
<P>
25-year-old Joan Heimbecker was shot to death on the Hamilton
campus two years ago. Her ex-boyfriend, 25-year-old Rory Foreman,
has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in her death, but not guilty
to first-degree murder. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>Ambulance attendants Paul Zenchuk and Seamus O'Connor say Joan
Heimbecker had no pulse, and had stopped breathing when they arrived
at her McMaster University residence minutes after ten o'clock
the night of March thirtieth, 1994. </I>
<P>
<I>O'Connor testified he noticed a shotgun near the apartment
entrance, and saw the shooting victim lying face-down on the floor,
covered with a blanket, her face pale and ashen. As he and his
partner worked to revive her, O'Connor says he noticed gaping
wounds in both shoulders, and the left side of her neck. Both
arms were broken, and her left knee-cap was missing. </I>
<P>
<I>About six hours earlier, the man who admits he killed Joan
Heimbecker, was singing along with two Conestoga College class-mates,
as he gave them a lift home from school in a rented car. Marsha
Chapman, who attended nursing classes with Rory Foreman at the
Kitchener college, says he wished her and her room-mate happy
Easter when he dropped them off. </I>
<P>
<I>Chapman, her room-mate and nursing professor Mary Colley all
encountered Foreman in the Conestoga college cafeteria the day
Joan Heimbecker died. They testified he told them he'd been up
most of the night before, visiting a friend in Toronto who had
been shot. </I>
<P>
<I>Another witness has said Foreman did go to Toronto the day
before Heimbecker was killed in order to pick up a gun. Professor
Colley told the court she had the impression Foreman was going
back to Toronto, to try to find the person who shot his friend.
She says she warned Foreman &quot;don't do anything to get yourself
into trouble.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>The jury has now been excused until Monday morning, so the
judge can hear legal arguments over the admissibility of evidence.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Sex Charges-Teacher </H3>

<P>
Twenty additional sexual assault charges have been laid against
an elementary school teacher in Niagara Falls. 
<P>
Last week a charge of sexual assault and sexual interference were
laid against the 55 year old teacher. After further investigation
17 other students came forward with sexual assault allegations.
The students are 8 and 9 year olds. Two are girls the other 16
are boys. 
<P>
The teacher was removed from the classroom in mid April when the
first charges were laid. The accused was set to retire at the
end of this school year. 
<HR>

<H3>Halton Rape </H3>

<P>
Halton Region Police have released details of another sexual assault
in Burlington, but said they don't believe it was committed by
the serial rapist being sought for brutal attacks on three youngsters.

<P>
A 14-year-old girl was sexually assaulted April 24 as she walked
home from a baby-sitting job. She was approached by a man and
forced into a secluded driveway, where she was assaulted. But
the suspect's description does not match that of a man who raped
three youngsters, aged eight, 10 and 15, in Kitchener, Brampton
and Oakville over the past four years. 
<HR>

<H3>Cross Missing </H3>

<P>
And Halton police are concerned about the disappearance of a 27
year old Oakville woman. 
<P>
Diane Cross is a teacher at St. Mildred Lightbourn school in Oakville.
Cross hasn't been seen since noon yesterday, when she left the
school during lunch hour. There is no known reason for her disappearance,
and her family is worried about her health. 
<P>
Diane Cross is a diabetic, and needs her medication daily. Ms.
Cross was last seen wearing a dark green coat, a blue and black
tweed jacket and skirt, and white running shoes. Anyone with information
is asked to call Halton Regional Police. 
<HR>

<H3>Milton Fatal </H3>

<P>
A single car crash last night in Milton claimed the life of a
man from Storrington Township. It happened on Tremaine Road just
before 9:30 ...a pick-up truck left the road and struck a tree.

<P>
38-year-old Edward Huntbach was pronounced dead at the scene.

<HR>

<H3>Water Park Fire </H3>

<P>
Firefighters are describing a major fire in the Niagara Falls
tourist district as highly suspicious. They were still on the
scene today after the early-morning blaze burned through a gift
shop, restaurant and change rooms at the Whitewater Waterside
park on Lundy's Lane at the QEW. Damage is estimated at 200-thousand
dollars. 
<P>
A maze of water slides and the park's wave pool were not affected.
The cause of the fire is under investigation. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Investors dumped stocks in Toronto and New York today as interest
rates in bond markets moved higher. The selloff was sparked by
new economic data in the US showing a stronger than expected economy.

<P>
Philip Environmental of Hamilton reported another healthy profit
for the first quarter of this year.

<H3>Copps Quits</H3>

<P>
She said she would resign if her government failed to scrap the
GST. And today Sheila Copps kept that promise. And on this same
day the prime minister called a by-election in Hamilton East,
for June 17th. 
<P>
Copp's announced her resignation at a packed news conference held
inside her east Hamilton constituency office over the noon hour.
Copps had been on the hot seat since she said last Thursday the
GST promise she had made prior to the last election was a fast
lip comment. 
<HR>

<H3>Copps History </H3>

<P>
The Copps name in Hamilton is synonymous with scrappy, down to
earth politics. Sheila Copps grew up with the imprint of her flamboyant
father who had a hand in shaping this city as mayor for 13 years.
Reporter Kathy Renwald looks back at the political and family
climate that shaped Sheila Copps. 
<P>
<I>Sheila Copps absorbed politics in her east Hamilton home. Father
Vic was one of this city's most popular mayors who had the common
touch with the people of his home town and a sense of flair that
daughter Sheila would mine as she scrapped her way into politics.
</I>
<P>
<I>At 9 campaigning for her sisters election to a catholic youth
group she showed joy in the political process. At home with mother
Geraldine who would go on to become a city alderman.. and her
dad the mayor ..Copps thrived in the atmosphere of lively conversation
and public spot light. At 24 she ran provincially and lost.. but
went on to work for liberal leader Stuart Smith.. the next time
Sheila Copps won the Hamilton Centre riding and would go on to
run against David Peterson for the leadership.. she finished second.
</I>
<P>
<I>In 1984 Sheila Copps was elected to the House of Commons, defeating
former Hamilton mayor Jack Macdonald. There her badgering and
baiting style quickly inked her membership in the Liberal rat
pack along with John Nunziata. She chased foes down staircases
and sparred in the commons like a street fighter. Her give and
take with John Crosby made nightly headlines. </I>
<P>
<I>Throughout her political career, Sheila Copps would draw on
the memory of her father who died in 1988 for inspiration. Copps
was the first woman to run for the federal liberal leadership.
And her daughter in the family tradition.. traveled in political
circles at an early age. </I>
<P>
<I>Just last week, deputy prime minister Copps sat with royalty
in the area named after her father ..but the storm was building
for her to resign and today she looked back to her roots for her
explanation to quit.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Canadian stock prices climbed to new record highs again today,
helped by a strengthening dollar and easing interest rates in
bond markets. 
<P>
Air Canada reports a loss in this year's first quarter. 
<P>
MasterCard and Bell Canada are launching Canada's first combination
calling and credit card. 
<HR>

<H3>Foreman 5 </H3>

<P>
Two more friends of the man accused of killing a McMaster University
student say he talked about buying a gun shortly before she died
of four shotgun blasts. And another says the accused withdrew
at least fifteen-hundred dollars in student loan money from a
bank account, just days before Joan Heimbecker's murder. 
<P>
All three testified today at the Hamilton trial of 25-year-old
Rory Foreman, who has pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but not
guilty to first-degree murder. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>Jason Stolper attended Conestoga College in Kitchener with
Rory Foreman. Two weeks before Joan Heimbecker was gunned down
at McMaster University, Stolper says he had a &quot;strange&quot;
conversation with Foreman while parked outside a Kitchener bar.
</I>
<P>
<I>Stolper testified Foreman said &quot;what I'm about to say
will get you and me in a lot of trouble if you tell anybody ...I'm
thinking about buying a gun.&quot; Stolper asked &quot;what do
you need a gun for? you're a big guy. you can take care of yourself.
you'd never shoot anybody anyway.&quot; Foreman replied &quot;oh
you don't know me. I would.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>Stolper says he thought Foreman was joking. But the day Joan
Heimbecker was shot to death, Stolper encountered Foreman in the
Conestoga College cafeteria. When Foreman mentioned he'd rented
a car, Stolper asked if he'd been to Toronto, and Foreman nodded
&quot;yes&quot;. Stolper says he assumed Foreman went to Toronto
to buy the gun. </I>
<P>
<I>Another close friend, Jody Bishop, ran into Foreman the day
before Joan Heimbecker died. Bishop says Foreman mentioned he
was going to Toronto to pick up a gun. The day of the murder,
Bishop briefly saw Foreman again. Bishop says Foreman told him
&quot;he'd picked it up.&quot;</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Hit &amp; Run </H3>

<P>
A Hamilton woman remains in hospital with serious injuries after
a two car hit and run accident in the city's east end last night.
Police say a blue Chevelle hit the woman's car after running a
red light. The driver and a passenger in the suspect car fled
the scene. 
<P>
Police say 64 year old Vivian Wells is expected to recover from
multiple injuries but are looking for the public's assistance
in finding the driver responsible.
<HR>

<H3>Bikers-Brock </H3>

<P>
Last night we told you how police in Hamilton are bracing for
new neighbours: about 20 members of Satan Choice. Simmering tensions
between rival bike gangs in Ontario and Quebec have police everywhere
on high alert. 
<P>
Today at Brock University in St. Catharines bomb disposal experts
from around the world were sharing information. And as Lauran
Sabourin reports biker activities was near the top of their agenda.

<P>
<I>The battleground for the biker wars up to now has been around
Montreal. The Hell's Angels the largest motorcycle gang on the
continent wants to extend its influence. Word is that Hell's Angels
want a foothold in the lucrative southern Ontario drug and prostitution
market. </I>
<P>
<I>Christian Nantel is a tactical officer with the Montreal police.
He's seen first hand the destruction that can result when bikers
declare war on each other. Bikers are dead. Innocent people killed.
Biker gangs are difficult to infiltrate. New recruits to prove
their loyalty are often required to kill someone. </I>
<P>
<I>There is a barrier between police and full fledged members
that is as thick as the concrete that protects their clubhouses.
Police in southern Ontario have launched a zero tolerance program
against bikers. The target in Niagara is the outlaws. But the
Hell's Angels have their eye on the peninsula. Turf wars usually
begin with strong intimidation tactics. Hundreds of rival bikers
treading on the others turf. And if the dispute in Montreal is
any indication these are wars that are not settled quickly.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Bomb Robot </H3>

<P>
During a break at the conference on international explosives and
terrorism experts got a look at the latest in bomb disposal hardware.

<P>
Remote control robots demonstrated how they could destroy active
explosives. The machines can climb stairs, deliver weaponry and
perform other functions in high risk situations.

<P>
More tonight on the police crackdown on biker activity in the
golden horseshoe. Last night after a series of raids, Niagara
Police Chief Grant Waddell vowed bikers who engage in illegal
activity will be hunted down and put behind bars. And that pre
emptive strike against the outlaws motorcycle gang in St. Catharines
may only be the beginning of a full fledged war between police
and bikers in southern Ontario. <BR>
As Lauran Sabourin reports police intend to destroy the gangs
by attacking their leadership. A man police have identified as
an outlaws kingpin appeared in court this morning. 
<P>
<I>Mario Parente president of the local Outlaws chapter in Niagara
appeared in a Hamilton court today on charges of cocaine trafficking
and uttering death threats. </I>
<P>
<I>A small army of police officers gathered at Parente's Niagara
falls farm today. They were there to conduct that intensive search
of the 50 acres of land. The Outlaws have significant control
over prostitution and drug dealing throughout the peninsula. </I>
<P>
<I>Other motorcycle gangs, Satan's Choice and Hell's Angels have
their eye on Niagara. Hell's Angels have been trying to gain a
foothold in Ontario for some time.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Foreman 4 </H3>

<P>
A long-time friend of a man accused of first degree murder testified
today an upbeat Rory Foreman talked out reconciling with his ex-girlfriend
just days before she was hit by four shotgun blasts at McMaster
University. But the same friend says Foreman talked about buying
a gun eight to ten weeks earlier. Reporter Deborah Walker is covering
the trial in Hamilton. 
<P>
<I>25-year-old Joan Heimbecker was gunned down in her on-campus
residence at McMaster University on March 30th, 1994. Six days
earlier, Heimbecker's ex-boyfriend, Rory Foreman, went drinking
with his buddy Dan la-ree in a Kitchener bar. </I>
<P>
<I>La-ree says Foreman told him he was going to Hamilton on the
weekend to patch things up with Joan. La-ree testified foreman
&quot;seemed in very good spirits. he was very spunky ...lots
of life ...and in a good mood.&quot; Under cross-examination La-ree
testified Foreman seemed to believe a reconciliation was possible.
He also said that, eight-to-ten weeks earlier, he was surprised
when Foreman told him he wanted to get a gun. La-ree testified
he asked Foreman &quot;what for?&quot; he said &quot;for protection.&quot;
La-ree said &quot;protection from what?&quot; He said &quot;just
...protection.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>In other testimony, defence lawyer Peter Bawden suggested two
witnesses had embellished their accounts of threatening phone
calls Foreman made to Joan Heimbecker after their relationship
ended. Paul Litt, who lived with the victim for five years in
her hometown of Clifford, says he talked to Joan two days before
she died. She told him Foreman told her &quot;if I can't have
you, nobody will.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>Bawden found it surprising that of all the friends, room-mates
and class-mates police interviewed, only Litt and his niece reported
Foreman's threats. But when the defence lawyer tried to point
out discrepancies between trial testimony, and initial statements
to police, Litt retorted... &quot;I didn't think it was that important
because everyone knew who the murderer was.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>Rory Foreman admits he killed Joan Heimbecker, but he says
her death was unintentional. At the outset of his trial, Foreman
pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but not guilty to first degree
murder.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Youth Forum </H3>

<P>
The victims of crime lobby group CAVEAT says young criminals commit
more than 100 crimes before they are first arrested. 
<P>
The number of murder arrests among 18-year-olds and younger has
climbed 93 per cent in the last decade and the number of 12 to
17-year-olds charged with violent crimes in general has skyrocketed
by more that 131 percent. 
<P>
CAVEAT has sponsored a number of forums including its <I>Safetynet
</I>conferences which have already resulted in changes to the
justice system. But tonight CAVEAT's Youth Council will sponsor
it's own public forum on the young offenders act and the role
it plays in youth crime.

<H3>Joe Brant - Cuts </H3>

<P>
Burlington's Joseph Brant Hospital has sounded the alarm. Officials
there are saying today the hospital is looking at disaster in
the face of a six million dollar - or ten percent - budget shortfall
this year. Joe Brant has already closed 59 beds and cut the equivalent
of 80 full-time jobs. 
<P>
Chief of Medical Staff, Dr. Ben Carruthers, says further cuts
will have to come at the expense of seniors awaiting scarce beds
in nursing homes. 
<P>
The Halton District Health Council is looking at the regions'
450 patient waiting list for nursing home beds. One suggestion
is to use some of the hospital beds being closed by Joe Brant.

to officially deliver the cheque. 
<HR>

<H3>Orr - United Way </H3>

<P>
Hamilton Wentworth United Way Chief Executive Officer Jody Orr

<H3>Outlaws Bust</H3>

<P>
An outlaw motorcycle kingpin is behind bars tonight after raids
on six biker clubs in the Hamilton - St. Catharines area. 
<P>
One hundred heavily armed police officers raided the clubhouse
and the homes of the outlaws biker gang in Niagara this morning.
They executed search warrants at five Niagara locations and one
in Hamilton. Police say this is only the first step toward eradicating
the bikers in the peninsula. 
<HR>

<H3>Gambling Bust </H3>

<P>
A crackdown on illegal gambling is underway in Hamilton Wentworth.
Last Friday, vice squad officers arrested two men and seized nine
illegal video gambling machines. As Jamie west reports...the raids
are the result of family concerns... 
<P>
<I>These video gambling machines are not set up for fun and games,
but for serious profit by their operators. And they're being discovered
by the dozens in small establishments around Hamilton Wentworth.
They're rigged to give the house the upper hand... they accept
bills not quarters... gamblers buy and bet credits that can later
be exchanged for cash. </I>
<P>
<I>Each machine can be programmed for the amount of money it will
pay out as a percentage of what amount of money is played. The
average is for every 100 hundred dollars played the machine will
allow the gambler to win 10 to 90 dollars back. The machine generates
about a  thousand dollars a day in profit for the operator. The
house never loses, but families do. </I>
<P>
<I>Friday night's raid on two Stoney Creek bars netted police
nine machines and 95-hundred dollars in cash. Charged with keeping
a common gaming house are 35-year old Antonia Mascia of Hamilton
and 34-year old Salvatore Vastano of Hamilton. And vice officers
warn,, you could be charged just for being inside a place that
operates these machines.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Drug Bust </H3>

<P>
A street level drug dealer sweep by Halton police netted 16 arrests
this morning at residences in Hamilton, Burlington, Oakville,
and the Mississauga area. 
<P>
Project WISK began as an undercover operations three months ago,
targeting illegal drug dealers trafficking in crack cocaine, marijuana,
hash and LSD. With seven people already served, today's arrests
being the total to 23 charged with a total of 66 offenses and
more are expected. 
<HR>

<H3>Foreman 3 </H3>

<P>
Just days before she was gunned down in her university residence,
prosecutors say a McMaster graduate student told friends she was
scared by a barrage of threatening phone calls from her ex-boyfriend.

<P>
As the victim's parents and friends sat in a Hamilton courtroom
today, testimony began in the first-degree murder trial of 25-year-old
Rory Foreman. Foreman has already admitted he's responsible for
the death of 25-year-old Joan Heimbecker. But he says he did not
intend to kill her. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>In her opening address, assistant crown attorney Alexandra
Paparella told the jury the evidence will show that Joan Heimbecker
called a friend two days before she was shot to death, and told
him Rory Foreman told her &quot;if I can't have you, nobody will.&quot;
</I>
<P>
<I>The day she died, Joan Heimbecker called another friend to
complain about threatening phone calls from Foreman, and to ask
&quot;do you think he'll do anything to hurt me?&quot; One hour
later, Joan Heimbecker was shot four times with a shot-gun in
her on-campus apartment at McMaster University's Bates Residence.
</I>
<P>
<I>The first witness to testify, a Hamilton- Wentworth Regional
Police officer, took the jury on a tour of the crime scene using
a videotape and photographs he shot the night Joan Heimbecker
was killed. Sgt. Frank Pedersen drew the jury's attention to a
sawed-off shot-gun abandoned near the apartment entrance, six
spent shotgun shells, blood-soaked towels, blood stains on the
rug, blood splatters on a wall, and two holes in the same wall
caused by shotgun blasts. </I>
<P>
<I>Paparella says evidence will show that before Joan Heimbecker
died, Rory Foreman pointed the shotgun at her, and while caressing
it ...said &quot;you've made me suffer. I'm going to make you
suffer now.&quot;</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Abductor Sentence </H3>

<P>
In another Hamilton courtroom today a would-be abductor received
a seven-year prison sentence. 
<P>
25-year-old Shawn Jamis was convicted in January of attempted
kidnapping and forcible seizure. He was arrested after a McMaster
co-ed was shoved head first into the trunk of a car. A police
officer heard her screams and thwarted the abduction. Mister Justice
Nick Borkovich called Jamis a danger to the public. 
<HR>

<H3>Robbery Suspect </H3>

<P>
Police in Welland are asking for the public's help in identifying
a man who held up the same bank twice last winter. Both robberies
occurred at the Bank of Nova Scotia branch on Niagara Street.

<P>
Police released a composite sketch of the suspect. He's described
as white, in his early 20's, with a slim build. He was wearing
a dark colored balaclava, blue jeans and dark colored jacket.

<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
The value of Canadian stocks in Toronto rose to their 21st record
high today as the dollar and interest rates remained stable. 
<P>
Small capitalized companies are one of the strongest performing
sectors for investors.

<H3>Busker Profile</H3>

<P>
An arrest has been made in the beating death of a friendly Hamilton
street musician. 
<P>
Police are still trying to piece together details of the crime
and the background of the quiet, well-liked man who died 12 days
after a violent encounter. Kathy Renwald reports. 
<P>
<I>His face was familiar to customers at the liquor store on York
Boulevard. 45 year old Michael Welsh played the guitar daily outside
the entrance and quietly accepted handouts. Now he's dead ..and
a police command post is set up outside the beer store on Dundurn
Street ..where Michael Welsh was beaten 2 weeks ago. </I>
<P>
<I>Charged with manslaughter is 33 year old Sandor Patocs, but
the investigation is still active. Police are trying to piece
together the details of Michael Welsh's life. </I>
<P>
<I>Though he appeared to be a loner, he has a wife, a daughter
and son, though they went their separate ways. He lived in this
apartment building for a while..but the superintendent cant place
the face..and couldn't find a record of Michael Welsh as a tenant.
</I>
<P>
<I>At the liquor store where he strummed the guitar employees
remember Welsh had a friend.. police have located her. The friend
lived at the other end of Queen Street..and for the last little
while Michael made his home here. During the last 12 days of his
life, Edna visited him in hospital, she said he could barely remember
his name. now his 19 year old son is coming to claim the body.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Meiler Arrest </H3>

<P>
And police in Kitchener have their man. Late this afternoon ...
murder suspect Mike Meiler was picked up in Kitchener Waterloo
Hospital. 
<P>
Waterloo Regional Police Sgt. Dennis Butcher was attending another
suspect at the hospital, when he spotted Meiler in the treatment
room and made the arrest, without incident. Police say he was
being treated for hypothermia at the time of his arrest. 
<HR>

<H3>Meiler Background </H3>

<P>
Just who is this man, who was the subject of a Canada-wide murder
warrant? Scot Urquhart reports. 
<P>
<I>Police raided this quiet home in west Flamborough last night
... looking for Mike Meiler. Meiler once lived here with his wife
... that was before the divorce ... before a man tried to confront
his estranged spouse... here in Kitchener; before Nicholas Biuk
was shot and killed ...trying to intervene. </I>
<P>
<I>After the split; Mike Meiler lived here briefly. The man who
answered the door of this Burlington residence, didn't want to
go on camera. He said Mike Meiler was a really good guy. A quiet
guy, who wanted to get back together ... with his wife. That Mike
Meiler was accused of murder was, he said: a real shock. </I>
<P>
<I>Vince Farkas was shocked too. not only did Mike Meiler once
work for him ... he was a friend of the family as well: and Vince
Farkas, echoes that sentiment.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Canal Drag </H3>

<P>
Hamilton- Wentworth Police are searching a drainage canal along
Highway 403 after some fisherman reeled in what appears to be
human hair. 
<P>
The marine unit was called in and dragging operations subsequently
snagged some articles of clothing. The major crimes unit is investigating.

<P>
The marine operations were hampered somewhat by the barriers installed
to keep carp out of Cootes Paradise. 
<HR>

<H3>Gibson Photo </H3>

<P>
Niagara Regional Police are asking for the public's assistance
in their investigation into the death of 41 year old John Gibson.
The body of the Welland cab driver was discovered in a drainage
ditch behind Nectar Donuts on the afternoon of Sunday April 14th.

<P>
An autopsy revealed that Gibson had drowned. Anyone with information
on Gibson's whereabouts is asked to call Niagara Regional Police
in Welland. 
<HR>

<H3>Booze-Sewers </H3>

<P>
The Canada Customs warehouse in Niagara Falls is overflowing with
booze. Smuggled liquor that has been seized at the border. 
<P>
But as Lauran Sabourin reports Canada Customs and Niagara Region
have come up with a plan that will see all of this contraband
go down the drain. 
<P>
<I>This is just one storage room at the custom warehouse in Niagara
Falls. A room that is wall to wall liquor cases. This is pretty
well packed... six thousand liquor bottles are stored in this
room. Bottles that have been here for more than a year because
it has been too time consuming to dispose of them. </I>
<P>
<I>Under the law Customs couldn't pour the liquor down the drain.
They had to pour it into bins and then transport those bins to
the treatment plant. </I>
<P>
<I>Customs probably has a better selection than the liquor store.
The number of liquor seizures at the border have remained the
same. But the commercial seizures of smuggled booze has gone up
significantly. Rusted out gas tanks. Placed into tubing. Smugglers
use all kinds of techniques to hide the contraband. </I>
<P>
<I>What can be seen is that the smuggled liquor is piling up.
Customs asked for new rules that would allow them to dump the
liquor down the drain. Ottawa and Niagara region have come to
an agreement, where customs can pour the liquor down the drain.
Liquor that can safely be treated. As long as they pay a surcharge.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Charles Details </H3>

<P>
Tickets are sold out for the noon-hour ceremony at Copps Coliseum
in honour of the Prince on Friday. But there will be one thousand
seats added to the trade show area at Copps Coliseum, this area
will have a television feed of the ceremonies. 
<P>
Tickets for the extra seating can be picked up at Copps Coliseum
box office beginning at 10 a.m. tomorrow. Organizers ask that
you be inside the coliseum no later than 11:30. 
<P>
Around 1:30, his motorcade will slow down in front of Gore Park,
on the way to the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in Mount Hope.
The Prince will arrive to open the museum shortly before 2 o'clock,
but you'll have to be there before one o'clock when parking will
be closed. The museum will be hosting an open house during the
event, and no tickets are required.
<HR>

<H3>Taro-Elliott </H3>

<P>
A preliminary hurdle has been cleared, paving the way for plans
for a Stoney Creek landfill site to go ahead. 
<P>
Environment Minister Brenda Elliott has approved the first stage
of an environmental assessment for the Taro Landfill site. Taro
plans to expand its current industrial landfill site just off
Highway 20 on Stoney creek mountain. 
<P>
Elliott's approval is only for the planning process, so there's
still a long way to go before the site is rejected to approved.

<HR>

<H3>1005 Vote </H3>

<P>
Steelworkers at Stelco's Hilton Works are voting again today,
on an early contract. The first deal between their union and Stelco
was rejected by only 9 votes. This second deal is essentially
the same as the first, but with wage improvements. 
<P>
Local 1005's current contract expires on July 31st. If ratified,
this agreement would give the steelworkers a six year deal with
Hilton Works. 
<HR>

<H3>Budgets</H3>

<P>
The Halton Board of Education has approved a budget with a 1.9-percent
increase over last years. That translates into a 28-dollar tax
increase for the average homeowner. The budget calls for six million
dollars worth of concessions to be negotiated from the boards
employees. 
<P>
Meanwhile, the Hamilton- Wentworth Separate Board has a deal with
its elementary school teachers. They've agreed to staff reductions
through attrition and to a restructuring of benefits to avoid
layoffs. Secondary teachers have so far refused to reopen their
contracts to help the separate board deal with its 6.4-million
dollar budget shortfall. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Stelco of Hamilton reports a drop in its sales and profits for
the first quarter of this year. 
<P>
Foreign investors spent more than three billion dollars in February
buying Canadian stocks and other securities. 
<P>
The dollar lost value today, stocks and bonds remained stable.

<H3>Meiler Wanted </H3>

<P>
Police across southern Ontario are searching for a Burlington
man tonight, wanted for murder. 
<P>
Waterloo Regional Police are issuing a Canada-wide warrant for
34-year-old Michael Meiler of Mountainside Drive, Burlington,
after a man died of a shotgun blast in an apparent domestic dispute
last night. 
<P>
Meiler is described as white, 6 foot-one, 220 pounds, he was wearing
jeans, hiking boots and a blue thinsulate coat. A shotgun was
recovered at the scene. Anyone with information on his whereabouts
should contact police. 
<HR>

<H3>Ohsweken Murder </H3>

<P>
An Ohsweken man has been charged with first degree murder after
a woman's body was found in a Brantford motel. 
<P>
39-year-old Paul Hill was arrested at the scene. The victim was
identified as his wife, 31-year-old Paula hill. Police say she
was stabbed to death. 
<HR>

<H3>Foreman Trial </H3>

<P>
The man accused in the shotgun slaying of a McMaster University
graduate student admits he's responsible for her death. 
<P>
However, on the opening day of his trial in Hamilton, 25-year-old
Rory Foreman pleaded not guilty to first degree murder. Deborah
Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>25-year-old Joan Heimbecker, a McMaster University graduate
student, died two years ago of multiple gunshot wounds. She was
gunned down in her residence on the Hamilton campus. Heimbecker's
former boyfriend, Rory foreman of Kitchener was charged with first-degree
murder in her death. </I>
<P>
<I>On the opening day of his trial, Foreman was arraigned before
a jury panel of 155 citizens. Foreman's lawyer said his client
had instructed him to plead not guilty to first degree murder,
even though foreman admits responsibility for Joan Heimbecker's
death. </I>
<P>
<I>However the defence lawyer says Foreman did not intend to kill
Joan Heimbecker, and therefore pleads guilty to the lesser charge
of manslaughter. However crown attorney Alexandra Papparella says
a guilty plea to manslaughter is unacceptable to the crown, and
that she is prepared to proceed with a first degree murder case
against Foreman.</I> 
<P>
Jury selection for the Foreman trial will begin in earnest tomorrow
morning. Nearly half the members of the jury panel were excused
today for reasons ranging from medical problems to financial hardship.

<P>
Among those excused today was Glanbrook Mayor Glen Etherington,
who explained to the court he was scheduled to share the podium
with Prince Charles on Friday, when the prince officially opens
the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in his municipality. 
<HR>

<H3>Beverage Charges </H3>

<P>
Four golden horseshoe men are facing a string of fraud and theft
charges after a two-year investigation into in a Burlington-based
beverage distributorship plan. 
<P>
The investigation involved global resources incorporated and related
companies all over Canada and the United States and the marketing
of an in-home carbonation device. Losses are expected to be in
the area of two million dollars. 
<P>
Charged are: 44-year-old Phillip Chan of Guelph, 46-year-old Randolph
Hay of Hamilton, 48-year-old Richard Vanderploeg Sr. of Stoney
creek, and 52-year-old William Chadderton of Mississauga. The
investigation is continuing and police say it does not pertain
to the merits of the beverage device itself. 
<HR>

<H3>Tiger Attack </H3>

<P>
That tiger attack on a couple last Friday has apparently not scared
off visitors to the African Lion Safari in Rockton. 
<P>
A man and woman are in Hamilton General Hospital after being mauled
Friday by a Bengal tiger. They drove through the tiger area with
their car windows down. 
<P>
Park spokeswoman Donna Clements says there does not seem to be
a difference in attendance since the attack. Park officials say
the tiger remains in isolation and under observation.
<HR>

<H3>ITT Cuts </H3>

<P>
Another major job exodus in St. Catharines. ITT automotive is
cutting 100 jobs almost a third of its workforce as it transfers
machining work to a sister plant in Tonawanda, NY. A spokesman
says it will be more cost-effective. 
<P>
Last Thursday, Cadbury Beverages Canada announced it was closing
its Mott's division in St. Catharines by the end of the year,
wiping out about 175 jobs which pay an average of $16 to $19 an
hour. 
<P>
The ITT phase-out meanwhile, is to begin in may or early June.
The company makes brake drums and rotors. The foundry will continue
to produce the castings, which will then be shipped for finishing
at the American plant. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
The value of Canadian stocks in Toronto rose to record highs today
as short term Canadian interest rates dropped while the dollar
remained stable.

<H3>Safari Bite </H3>

<P>
A man and woman have been rushed to hospital in Hamilton after
they were attacked by a tiger at the African Lion Safari near
Cambridge. 
<P>
A spokesperson at the safari says a the couple were in a car with
the windows rolled down among a group of tigers. We have a crew
at the scene and will bring you more details as we receive them.

<HR>

<H3>Protest </H3>

<P>
Another day of protest against the Ontario government is over.
20 to 40-thousand people ... the crowd size depends on who you
believe, police or organizers ... gathered under sunny skies in
Kitchener over the noon hour to rally against spending cuts by
Mike Harris' government. 
<P>
Unionized workers shut down at least 15 major factories, and disrupted
mail service and garbage pickup in the Kitchener, Waterloo and
Cambridge area. Police officers from several local towns stood
by, but the demonstration was peaceful. 
<HR>

<H3>Tsubouchi-Women </H3>

<P>
While the Tories were being jeered in Kitchener- Waterloo; a group
of women were politely applauding if not singing their praise
in Hamilton- Wentworth. Scot Urquhart explains: 
<P>
<I>Hard on the heels of a five week public sector strike ... on
a day when the Harris government was being vilified in KW one
of its most widely criticized ministers, got to come to Hamilton;
towing a wagon-load full of cash. </I>
<P>
<I>Only two of the four local Tories were on hand to see Tsubouchi
drop nearly five million dollars into the region ...that's close
to half of the eleven million dollar total to be spent on capital
construction costs for 9 women's shelters, across the province.
But will there be more provincial money available to run those
new buildings? </I>
<P>
<I>Still ... the operators of both Inasmuch House, and Interval
House are grateful. Their shelters are bursting at the seams;
and literally falling apart. The money is truly appreciated. But
do they really believe that the Tories are serious about supporting
women? </I>
<P>
<I>The irony in all of this: even as Tsubouchi was making his
announcement; a 30 year old Hamilton woman was fighting for her
life ... after being stabbed repeatedly in her Roxborough Avenue
home. Police arrested a suspect: the woman's former common-law
husband. He was charged with attempted murder, and breach of probation:
that being a court order, to stay away from his former spouse.
</I>
<P>
<I>Tsubouchi says, the government found eleven million dollars
to build new women's shelters through administrative efficiencies,
and wiser spending practices. Women across Ontario are hoping
that he can find a lot more .... before it's too late. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Slain Woman Fund </H3>

<P>
The co-workers of a Winona woman murdered last year by her estranged
husband have established a memorial scholarship in her name. 
<P>
26-year old Alayne Bryk a GO Transit enforcement officer, was
shot in a murder-suicide at her home last August by her husband,
Michael Auer. 
<P>
Bryk's co-workers have established the Alayne Bryk memorial scholarship
to support second-year law and security students at Hamilton's
Mohawk College. Bryk completed the college's law and security
program in 1990 after attending Nelson High School in Burlington.

<HR>

<H3>Education Follow </H3>

<P>
It's official. Public school supporters in Hamilton will face
an education tax hike this year. It's just over 3-percent. But
as Anthony Pooley reports tonight... that assumes five million
dollars in concessions from unions. 
<P>
<I>After putting low seniority teachers through hell with layoff
notices en route to what taxpayers believed was to be a hold the
tax line budget, Hamilton's Public School Board trustees veered
sharply to the left last night, handing down a budget that calls
for a 3.16- percent hike in education taxes ... twice the rate
of inflation. </I>
<P>
<I>The board will spend 254 million dollars of your money this
year. A typical realty tax hike is about 31 dollars. All of this
assumes that five million dollars can be saved with co-operation
from teachers unions ... but a rough ride is still expected. </I>
<P>
<I>Despite provincial reductions in transfer payments to school
boards, Education Minister John Snobelen has washed his hands
of responsibility for layoffs and local tax hikes, saying those
decisions rest with local trustees. But without a doubt ... certain
unpleasant things roll down hill.</I>
<HR>

<H3>School Search </H3>

<P>
Police in Hamilton are on the look out for a suspicious male who
has been entering city schools attempting to steal purses or money
from staff members. 
<P>
Yesterday, police were called to three schools in less than a
hour after a man walked in, but fled when confronted. He is described
at white, 40 to 50 years old, about 6 feet tall with a medium
build and a pock marked face. He has grey curly hair and was seen
wearing blue jeans, cowboy boots, a baseball cap and ski jacket.
Anyone with information should contact Hamilton Regional Police.

<HR>

<H3>Teacher Sex Assault </H3>

<P>
A long-time catholic school teacher stands charged with sexually
assaulting one of his students. Other charges may be pending as
police interview other alleged victims -- both boys and girls.

<P>
The 55-year-old lives in Pelham, but teaches at a small, Niagara
Falls elementary school. He's to appear in court May 2nd on one
count of sexual assault and one of sexual interference. Investigators
refuse to identify the specific school involved. 
<HR>

<H3>Strip Club Charges </H3>

<P>
A raid on a strip club in Niagara Falls has netted police 17 arrests,
including the owner of the club. 
<P>
Police conducted a month-long investigation into lap dancing and
other activities at the club. The owner of the Sundowner Inn,
47-year-old Chris Rudan, is among four employees charged with
keeping a common bawdy house. 
<P>
Four customers were charged as found-ins, and nine dancers face
charges of being inmates of a common bawdy house. Niagara Regional
Police say further charges are pending. 
<HR>

<H3>Eisenberger - Prostitution</H3>

<P>
Hamilton alderman Fred Eisenberger thinks he may have a solution
to the city's prostitution problem... create a red light district.

<P>
Eisenberger says &quot;Hamilton needs to come to terms with the
fact that prostitution is not going away&quot; to that end he
says creating a red light zone away from residential areas may
be a solution. The suggestion is being received positively by
fellow alderman Dave Wilson and Lansdale Neighborhood Watch vice
chair Stella Woock. 
<HR>

<H3>MOT Closure </H3>

<P>
If you're about to book your appointment for a driving test take
note... the drivers exam centre located at the Mountain Plaza
Mall in Hamilton is one of 12 across the province slated for closure.
Exam centres are also being closed in Cambridge, Guelph Kitchener
and Brantford. 
<P>
Employees at the Hamilton Centre will be relocated to the city's
only remaining driver exam location on Kenora Avenue in east Hamilton.
No word on the official date for the Upper James closure.
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Some expected economic data on US inflation and American retail
sales helped to stabilize financial markets in the US and Canada.

<P>
The Canadian dollar strengthened while interest rates eased.

<H3>Snobelen - Cuts </H3>

<P>
If you live in Hamilton, what happens over the next few hours
could affect your children and your tax bill. 
<P>
In one-half hour's time, trustees with the Hamilton Board of Education
will meet to finalize the budget, a budget that has been fraught
with controversial cutting in efforts to meet dramatically reduced
provincial funding. 
<P>
Yesterday, the Separate School Board announced it would not have
to resort to layoffs. Will the public board will able to match
those efforts and what about junior kindergarten? Education Minister
John Snobelen in Hamilton this afternoon said he regrets that
cutbacks could result in layoffs but its up to the local boards
to try to protect the futures of young teachers. 
<HR>

<H3>Skills Development </H3>

<P>
Well if there won't be many teaching jobs in the future, where
will young people find work? 
<P>
One area is trades and skills. This year's skills competition
is underway at Copps Coliseum in Hamilton. It's comprised of a
series of contests where young people showcase the skills that
just may guarantee them employment in this shrinking economy.

<P>
<I>They're building they're future. Hundreds of students entered
in the annual skills competition. Brick layers, carpenters, future
engineers. These contestants are combing, shaving trimming their
way to a career as a hair stylist. </I>
<P>
<I>Everything has to be just right. These culinary high school
students are creating masterpieces on plates. Looks too good to
eat but the discriminating palates of the judges are difficult
to satisfy. </I>
<P>
<I>Even if these contestants don't win this competition, they
can take heart in the fact that their skills will almost guarantee
them a future.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Sesqui Murals </H3>

<P>
A group of 20 young people are putting their skills to the test,
giving downtown Hamilton a bit of a facelift at the same time.

<P>
They're painting murals, depicting the history of Hamilton in
30 year segments, on the abandoned Lister Block Building. Annette
Hamm has the details. 
<P>
<I>150 years of Hamilton's history will soon cover the graffiti
on the Lister Block. And with each brush stroke, the 20 young
people working on the Sesqui Silhouette Project, are doing more
than painting murals. </I>
<P>
<I>The painters, not all of them artists, are on six month contracts,
funded by Youth Service Canada and the Hamilton and Region Arts
Council. Some are learning marketing skills. </I>
<P>
<I>Once this mural is complete, they'll have to push their work
to owners of other downtown Hamilton buildings, in hopes of putting
up four large outdoor murals. </I>
<P>
<I>They're also learning people skills, explaining to passers-by
what they're doing. this group hopes to unveil their larger murals
by August.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>1005 Newser </H3>

<P>
Steelworkers at Stelco's Hilton Works are going back to the ballot
box next week. Two weeks ago, they turned down the first contract
by only 9 votes. The membership itself is split between aging
workers who want pension improvements, and younger workers who
want better wages. 
<P>
The president of local 1005 thinks this second attempt will please
everyone. Annette Hamm reports. 
<P>
<I>In a Hamilton hotel room, Local 1005 president John Martin
and his union executive called a news conference to give a summary,
but not the exact details of their latest contract with Stelco's
Hilton Works. </I>
<P>
<I>The second attempt at getting an early contract is exactly
the same as the one members narrowly rejected a few days ago,
but it has improvements. The contract is for six years, a length
Martin feels may break an infamous tradition with his union. </I>
<P>
<I>Since its inception in 1946, Local 1005 has gone on strike
every third contract. That unlucky number three would come up
in 1999, but if this deal is ratified, Martin hopes it would take
them past that without a dispute.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Bad economic news for St. Catharines. The Motts Beverage Company
is closing down its plant throwing 175 people out of work. Company
officials say the termination of a licensing agreement with US.
giant Ocean Spray is to blame. 
<HR>

<H3>Boutcher Sentence </H3>

<P>
A Hamilton man has been sentenced to five years in penitentiary
after pleading guilty to impaired driving. 
<P>
35-year-old Daniel Boutcher was involved in a two-car crash which
took the lives of two children. Sonia Salazar told the court that
losing a 9-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter has stolen her
life. 
<P>
Boutcher has two prior impaired driving convictions and 16 other
criminal convictions. Along with the five year sentence, he lost
his licence for ten years. 
<HR>

<H3>Pole Damage</H3>

<P>
A ten minute vandalism spree in downtown Hamilton last night caused
several thousand dollars in damage, and landed one man in custody.

<P>
It started when a man destroyed an office desk and a phone, and
kicked a four inch hole in the wall at a James Street North address.
He then ran outside, grabbed a seven foot steel pole from a parking
lot and tried to ram it through a phone booth, where two people
were making a call. They were lucky enough to get out of the way
as the suspect went on to destroy another phone booth. 
<P>
Before the spree ended, several double pane windows and a glass
door at a CIBC branch were smashed. 
<P>
28 year old Odion Ihimogie of no fixed address faces several mischief
charges, including two counts of mischief endangering life. 
<HR>

<H3>Break In </H3>

<P>
Another warning from police to keep your doors and windows locked
up, even when you're home at night. This after yet another overnight
break-in on Hamilton's west mountain. 
<P>
A woman woke up at 4 this morning to find someone with a flashlight
in her living room. The intruder escaped, but some property was
recovered outside the house. Police say the suspect got in by
removing a screen on a kitchen window. 
<HR>

<H3>Nabbed Off Duty </H3>

<P>
An alert neighbour and an off duty cop spelled trouble for a group
of young car thieves on Hamilton mountain. 
<P>
A woman called her neighbour, detective Warren Korol, when she
saw five teens casing out a car on her street. Korol ran a check
of the vehicle's license plates and discovered it had been reported
stolen. He caught up with the kids as they were parking the car
just around the corner. 
<P>
Four passengers took off after he identified himself, but Korol
was able to chase the driver on foot and hold him until on duty
officers arrived. 
<P>
A 15 year old boy has been charged with possession over 5-thousand
dollars and possession of a prohibited weapon. Police found a
can of pepper spray while making their arrest. 
<HR>

<H3>CHAT Anniversary </H3>

<P>
Police, fire and the medical community got together this afternoon
to celebrate three years of the CHAT program. 
<P>
CHAT stands for Community and Hospital Against Trauma. The educational
program focuses on young people showing them first hand the dangers
of risk-taking behaviour. 
<P>
Students are given tours of hospital ER's, ICU and rehab areas
with the hope that the message will sink in. Drama students from

<H3>Crooked Cops</H3>

<P>
Two Hamilton- Wentworth Regional Police officers have been charged
with profiting from people's misfortune. 
<P>
They stand accused tonight of using confidential information to
send business to a Hamilton auto repair shop. Both officers have
been suspended with pay. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>The arrests follow an intensive six-month investigation by
Hamilton- Wentworth Regional Police, an investigation sparked
by complaints over the last few years. </I>
<P>
<I>45-year-old Ted Chrysler of Hamilton, a nineteen year veteran
with the Hamilton- Wentworth police, is charged with two counts
of criminal breach of trust. 25-year-old Dino Morandin of Beamsville
is charged with criminal breach of trust and receiving a secret
commission. He is also charged with theft in connection with a
missing police radio, and fraud in connection with an insurance
claim. </I>
<P>
<I>Morandin was honored as chosen officer of the year for 1994.
The owner of Parkdale auto collision, 45-year-old Antonio Costa
Cunha of Hamilton, has also been charged with giving a secret
commission. </I>
<P>
<I>Police say further arrests or charges are possible.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Cop Charged </H3>

<P>
And a patrol officer with the Hamilton- Wentworth force appeared
in court today on an assault charge. 
<P>
Officer Glen Marshall, a 20-year-veteran, was arrested following
a domestic dispute in Stoney Creek last night. The incident involves
allegations that a common-law wife had been shoved and slapped
by her common-law husband, during an argument. 
<HR>

<H3>Stelco - 1005 Deal </H3>

<P>
For the second time in as many months, a tentative agreement has
been reached between Stelco and steelworkers local 1005. The first
one was turned down by members by a mere 9 votes. Anthony Pooley
reports. 
<P>
<I>Steelworkers 1005 executive members will be briefed on the
proposed new deal tomorrow morning. They'll talk to reporters
tomorrow afternoon... although standard practice is not to reveal
the details until union members have been briefed. That will happen
at the convention centre starting with stewards on Sunday at six...
the membership meeting will take place at eight. For those who
can't make that meeting, there'll be another one Monday morning
at ten. </I>
<P>
<I>Two weeks ago, union members turned thumbs down on a six year
deal, as union members split along age lines. A big part of that
proposed deal was a hike of 240 dollars a month in pension benefits...
which appealed to the half of the membership that will soon be
able to retire. But those who won't be able to do that any time
soon killed the proposed pact. </I>
<P>
<I>As for Stelco ... they're looking for stability of production...
voting on the deal will begin at the Hilton Works plant gates
with the first shift next Wednesday morning.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>JK Hamilton </H3>

<P>
it appears the Hamilton board of education wants to hang on to
junior kindergarten... even though it will cost 800 thousand dollars.
last night in committee, trustees voted 10-3 to save the program.
some trustees say they want to revisit the issue again Thursday
night though. the trustees managed to slash another million dollars,
mainly in transportation cuts for special education students but
they still have another 5.6. million to trim. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
The National Transportation Agency has grounded Greyhound Air&#133;
at least for the time being. 
<P>
But the head of Tradeport International, the group that runs Hamilton's
Airport says don't worry. Tony Battaglia says air service licensing
is a complicated issue and that he still expects Greyhound Air
to start flying out of Hamilton as of May 22nd. 
<P>
All flights will be to Winnipeg with connections to other western
Canadian destinations. Return fares to Vancouver will start at
269 dollars. 
<HR>

<H3>Surgery Delays</H3>

<P>
There's been a lot of talk about healthcare reform in Hamilton
Wentworth over the last few months, but one element that has taken
a back seat to all the political aspects of the story are the
patients, and as Jamie West reports, one Hamilton man is sending
out a message to all taxpayers...wake up and speak up 
<P>
<I>George Savelli is talking about his brother Reno. The 70 year
old man just underwent cancer surgery at Hamilton General Hospital,
but it came in the wee hours of the morning after an on again
off again relationship with the healthcare system. </I>
<P>
<I>Reno Savelli was prepped and ready for surgery but at the last
minute it was canceled.. ,.because there was no intensive care
bed available. So he was sent home. </I>
<P>
<I>George cast's no blame but instead credits the people who are
on the front-line of a healthcare system in critical condition.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Ozone Warning </H3>

<P>
The sun came out today just in time for this warning from Environment
Canada. 
<P>
The protective ozone layer over Canada is expected to be below
normal this summer. The ozone layer filters out harmful ultraviolet
radiation. 
<P>
Even at normal ozone levels, UV rays are strong enough in the
summer to cause health problems such as skin cancer, eye damage
and a weakening of the immune system.

<HR>

<H3>Diabetic Driver </H3>

<P>
A Hamilton woman says she'll do all she can to prevent another
tragedy like the one that killed her daughter and grandson. 
<P>
Four people were killed in a fiery car crash near Brantford are
outraged a diabetic man who caused the crash is still driving.
44-year-old Gordon Wood was charged with four counts of dangerous
driving causing death in connection with the 1994 crash that killed
two adults and two children. 
<P>
Yesterday, Mr. Wood walked out of court a free man after the crown
withdrew the charges. Wood's defence was based on a condition
called &quot;hypoglycemic unawareness&quot; a condition that causes
a diabetic to lapse into a state where they are not aware of their
actions. 
<HR>

<H3>Homolka </H3>

<P>
A committee of people opposed to Karla Homolka's plea-bargain
showed up on Parliament Hill today to demand a federal inquiry.

<P>
The group presented a lengthy petition to back up its call for
the deal to be overturned. Group members also showed support for
a bill tabled by a liberal senator in hopes of overturning the
plea-bargain. 
<P>
The bill, introduced by Anne Cools in the upper chamber in February,
would also quash future plea-bargains if incriminating evidence
is found after the deals are made. 
<P>
Homolka received 12 years in prison in exchange for testimony
against her ex-husband, Paul Bernardo, in the sex killings of
Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy. 
<HR>

<H3>Charlton Fire </H3>

<P>
The Fire Marshall was on the scene today of an early morning fire
that caused fifty-thousand dollars damage to a Hamilton apartment
building, and left two tenants suffering from smoke inhalation.

<P>
The fire started in a basement storage room, and sent heavy smoke
through the thirteen-unit building on Charlton Street East. Everyone
who lives there has found temporary accommodation elsewhere. 
<P>
Meanwhile, a furnace room fire caused over 100-thousand dollars
damage to an east Hamilton home yesterday afternoon. two adults
escaped the Strawberry Drive residence safely, but their pet cat
suffered smoke inhalation. 
<HR>

<H3>Foolish Thieves </H3>

<P>
They had the tools, but not necessarily the brains for the job
at hand. Two teenagers used a pair of bolt-cutters to pry open
the back door of a Hamilton surplus store yesterday. Trouble is,
it was one o'clock in the afternoon, and as they waltzed through
the door they encountered a warehouse full of workers. 
<P>
Two employees of Quality Surplus on Cavell Street chased the pair
for ten blocks before cornering one of them in an alleyway. Two
seventeen- year-olds from Hamilton are charged with break-and-enter
with intent. One of them is also charged with possession of a
dangerous weapon, and breach of recognizance. 
<HR>

<H3>Downtown Taxes </H3>

<P>
Downtown Hamilton businesses could still be in for a tax break.
Today, the city's finance committee asked staff to prepare a report
showing the impact of giving downtown businesses anywhere from
a ten to fifty per cent cut in their business and realty taxes.

<P>
As Deborah Walker reports, those who support tax relief believe
it's the only way to stop the city centre from dying. 
<P>
<I>Hamilton Alderman Vince Agro says it's time for city politicians
to stop talking, and actually do something to halt the decline
of the downtown. </I>
<P>
<I>But some aldermen are skeptical about claims downtown taxes
are too high. They want to see comparative figures to prove it.
Others fear a blanket tax break will simply encourage speculators
to sit on vacant properties. </I>
<P>
<I>A staff report comparing taxes, and outlining the implications
various tax breaks, should be ready in three weeks.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>School Funding </H3>

<P>
There will be no layoffs of teachers or support staff in schools
run by Hamilton's Separate School Board this year. This from Director
of Education Jim Daly today, as he and public school board counterpart
Don Goodridge faced business people, students and others in a
panel discussion on education funding. Channel 11's Anthony Pooley
was there. 
<P>
<I>Some good news today for Separate School educators and education
in Hamilton- Wentworth from director Jim Daly ... no lay-offs.
</I>
<P>
<I>But despite the good news, some separate high school students
remain at once worried and concerned. </I>
<P>
<I>At the same time... the view through the window into public
education funding through the eyes of director Don Goodridge is
significantly less appealing. Lay-offs galore, as trustees and
administrators crunch numbers in an attempt not to raise local
taxes. </I>
<P>
<I>Indeed, millions of dollars have been cut from public school
spending already... and this episode in Philip Environmental's
&quot;Let's Talk Education&quot; speakers series was well received.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Pension Hearings </H3>

<P>
The cross country hearings on the future of the Canada Pension
Plan stopped in Hamilton today. 
<P>
The hearing panel is getting input from ordinary citizens on how
to keep the pension plan operating. There are dire warnings that
the fund could run dry by the next century. To avoid that the
government is talking about raising contributions and lowering
benefits. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
They were all smiles in the Chrysler boardroom today. The number
three automaker first quarter earnings are seventy percent higher
than a year ago. 
<P>
Chrysler earned just over a billion dollars from January through
March... a first quarter record for the company. 
<HR>

<H3>Grand River Rising </H3>

<P>
The waters of the grand river were running fast and furious today.

<P>
Levels rose 10 to 12 millimeters in the upper part of the grand
river watershed overnight after all this rain we've been having.
The flowrate has dropped somewhat but the conservation authority
warns the water will remain dangerous for the next several days.

<H3>Niagara Casino</H3>

<P>
Maple Leaf Village has hit the jackpot. The one time amusement
complex has been chosen as the site for the province's newest
casino in Niagara falls. 
<P>
The tourism minister made the announcement this morning at a news
conference in the honeymoon capitol. Lauran Sabourin was there.

<P>
<I>Dino Di Cienzo and his business associates are up on cloud
nine. The Di Cienzo group beat out two other strong contenders.
</I>
<P>
<I>The Casino Corporation felt that Maple Leaf Village had superior
facilities. It was just on the other side of the Rainbow Bridge.
Curious tourists are enticed by the facade. </I>
<P>
<I>Inside the building is empty. Stores abandoned. Tourists attractions
shut down. But replace the ski ball machines with gaming tables
and this place will come alive. </I>
<P>
<I>The government is counting on 80 percent of the revenue taken
in at the tables to be in U.S. dollars. That works out to about
650 million a year. And Maple Leaf Village was seen as the best
site to exploit that opportunity. </I>
<P>
<I>The casino project is expected to create three thousand jobs.
Six thousand jobs for Niagara region. And nine thousand jobs for
the province as a whole. </I>
<P>
<I>Niagara Falls attracts about 20 million tourists a year. With
the casino as another major attraction its hoped those tourists
will stay longer, spend more money and keep coming back.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Task Force - Region</H3>

<P>
Hamilton- Wentworth regional councilors are betting on a plan
to keep all Hamilton hospitals open, while still achieving the
savings expected by the provincial government. 
<P>
Today's the deadline for responding to the Health Action Task
Force report that recommends closing St. Joseph's Hospital, and
transferring its operations to Henderson Hospital. Instead, members
of the region's health and social services committee unanimously
back a plan proposed by the people who run the hospitals themselves.
Deborah walker reports. 
<P>
<I>Last Friday, hospital administrators unveiled a plan to keep
all four acute care hospitals in Hamilton open. However, Henderson
Hospital would lose half its beds, and its emergency department
would be down-graded to an urgent care unit. Regional councilors
representing Hamilton mountain still agreed to support the plan,
but they did so reluctantly. </I>
<P>
<I>The hospital CEO's estimate their proposal would save 92-million
dollars, and they want that money to stay in Hamilton to expand
non-hospital health services like nursing homes and chronic care
facilities. Regional councilors agree. </I>
<P>
<I>It's now up to the Hamilton- Wentworth District Health Council
to decide if it prefers the CEO's plan, or the one suggested by
the task force. The health council will forward its final recommendations
to the province by the end of May. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Student Employment </H3>

<P>
Student groups held a news conference today to say it's unacceptable
for people to have to take out loans to feed their children. They're
protesting a government plan to cut post-secondary students with
children off welfare. Annette Hamm will have more on the story
in our next half-hour. 
<P>
This comes as many students are looking for summer jobs. The Canada
Employment Centre for Students opened its doors in Hamilton's
Jackson Square this morning. 
<P>
The office will be open Monday to Friday, 8:30 to 4:30 daily.
Employers are encouraged to place job postings as soon as possible.
Students are welcome to use the service. 
<HR>

<H3>B.B. Bargoons </H3>

<P>
The home decorating chain B.B. Bargoons is closing its doors in
Burlington, St. Catharines and a number of communities in southern
Ontario, leaving more than 50 employees without jobs. 
<P>
The company slipped into receivership last week. The one-time
Canadian retailing phenomenon says the already slimmed-down 10-store
operation is cutting back to two outlets in the hopes of waiting
out its founder calls a terrible economic climate; as consumers
save their money instead of spending it at retail outlets. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Flamborough based Wescam Incorporated continues to grow. Today
they announced they had purchased TV-2 Limited of Wellingborough,
England. No purchase price was announced. Their primary activity
is broadcasting sporting events. Wescam is the world leader in
the design and manufacture of aerial cameras and transmission
systems. 
<HR>

<H3>Body Found </H3>

<P>
Niagara Region Police are not ruling out foul play following the
discovery of a body in a ditch in Welland. 
<P>
The grisly discovery was made by a group of children early yesterday.
The dead man has been identified as 41-year-old John Gibson. 
<HR>

<H3>Accident Victim </H3>

<P>
A Niagara Falls man has died of injuries suffered in a car crash
earlier this month. 55-year-old John Vanderlee's car crossed into
on-coming traffic on Morrison Street during bad weather and struck
a second vehicle. That driver was not hurt. No charges will be
laid. 
<HR>

<H3>Lab Busted </H3>

<P>
Halton police have busted another hydroponic marijuana lab. This
one on Abbeywood Drive, Oakville. 
<P>
They seized more than 10-thousand dollars in cash, 15 pounds of
marijuana and about 40 plants together worth about 160 thousand
dollars. 
<P>
Two Oakville men are charged: 43-year-old Keith John Nisbet and
Lutchi San Pedro, 36.
<HR>

<H3>Wedding Mayhem </H3>

<P>
Uninvited guests did more than just crash a Hamilton wedding ceremony
yesterday. One of them punched the groom in the mouth. 
<P>
Hamilton- Wentworth Regional Police say five people showed up
at the morning ceremony at the Sikh Temple on Covington Street.
One of them knocked off the groom's head-dress, then punched him.

<P>
The groom's former brother-in-law, 37-year-old Manjit Sandhu of
Brampton, is charged with assault, and disturbing a religious
ceremony. Four others from Brampton and Mississauga are charged
with disturbing a religious ceremony.

<H3>Alternative Plan</H3>

<P>
There was a &quot;love-in&quot; at a downtown Hamilton hotel this
afternoon. Nearly all of Hamilton Wentworth's big players in healthcare
gathered before the media to present the Health Action Task Force
with their response to the report &quot;Our Health Our Future&quot;
that was released over a month ago. 
<P>
The controversial report contains recommendations that includes
the closure of St. Joseph's Hospital and it's internal re-location
to the site now occupied by Henderson General. 
<P>
As Jamie west reports...CEO's of all the major hospitals joined
forces coming up with what they call a &quot;made in Hamilton
solution&quot;... 
<P>
<I>Just an hour before the CEO's released their response, a group
from St. Joseph's Hospital arrived on the door step of the Health
Action Task Force with thousands of names on a petition to save
St. Joe's. </I>
<P>
<I>Meanwhile, just a block away at the Hamilton Sheraton, CEO's
and board members of all Hamilton hospitals issued their response
to the task force report.... the highlights include.... leaving
St. Joseph's and the Henderson intact ... the Henderson would
reduce it's beds from 323 to 160. It would focus as a center of
excellence in cancer treatment, and major joint reconstruction
and become an urgent care centre. </I>
<P>
<I>Those with emergency's would be treated and stabilized but
not admitted, they would instead be transferred to other hospitals
or sent home. Most of Henderson's obstetrics would move to McMaster
and it's respiratory and urology moved to St. Joe's. The Hamilton
General would increase it's capacity to deal with psychiatric
patients. </I>
<P>
<I>The CEO's group has named itself the Academic Health Care Network,
and says their response meets the goal of 18 percent provincial
funding cuts while maintaining a strong healthcare system. But
the question is how much impact will the response have on the
task force. </I>
<P>
<I>The deadline for public feedback on the task force report is
Monday. The district health council will consider both reports
and other public submissions until May 27th, at which time final
recommendations will be made to the minister of health.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>House Lottery </H3>

<P>
Hamilton's St. Joseph's Hospital hopes you'll take a chance on
supporting healthcare in our community. 
<P>
The hospital's foundation today unveiled its winners choice lottery.
Unlike other fund raising lotteries, this one give winners their
choice of the top prize. Included in the choice: a 300 thousand
dollar plus Alterra home in Ancaster. But that's not all. Foundation
officials hope to sell 85-thousand tickets. They go on sale Monday.

<HR>

<H3>Drugs Stolen </H3>

<P>
Niagara police have issued a warning about potentially lethal
drugs and syringes stolen during a break and enter at a Welland
veterinary clinic. 
<P>
Most of the missing drugs are harmful if taken and potentially
fatal. Anyone with information is asked to call Niagara police
or Crime Stoppers. 
<HR>

<H3>Brock Appeal </H3>

<P>
Brock University is seeking leave to appeal a court ruling in
a decade-old harassment complaint. 
<P>
Brock has filed notice with the Ontario Court of Appeal that it
intends to appeal a lower court's rejection of its claim that
it couldn't receive a fair hearing at the Ontario Human Rights
Commission. 
<P>
Mary Warner, a former history department secretary, filed a complaint
in February 1986 stating she was sexually harassed by two professors.
The complaint also now includes allegations she was fired six
months later in retaliation for testifying in June 1985 about
students' complaints against one of the professors. A series of
legal maneuvers has delayed resumption of a hearing that started
in may 1993. 
<P>
It's not known when the appeal court might consider the university's
request. 
<HR>

<H3>1005 - Stelco </H3>

<P>
Stelco Steel and local 1005 are headed back to the bargaining
table in Toronto. 
<P>
The two sides are working with a provincial mediator in an attempt
to reach a new agreement. The union also announced today that
250 workers are being recalled for summer relief. 
<P>
Local 1005 president John Martin said the main bargaining issues
are contract length and profit sharing. 
<HR>

<H3>Hamilton Education Cuts </H3>

<P>
The Hamilton Board of Ed is ready to pick the pockets of its employees
... to keep Hamilton taxpayers from digging further into theirs.

<P>
The board is looking for five million dollars in contract concessions
to help it climb out of a multi-million dollar budget hole. Scot
Urquhart has more: 
<P>
<I>The reaction from teachers unions, is no surprise. When the
Hamilton Board of Ed decided last night to negotiate five million
dollars in budget cuts from the contracts of eleven different
unions, there was bound to be resistance .... but board members
are beginning to feel they have nowhere else to go.</I>
<P>
<I>With a total budget of 264 million ... the board will spend
roughly 30 million to operate the schools .... more than 18 million
on taxes and other debts .... roughly 7 and a half million, for
central administration .... and more than five million dollars,
on transportation. </I>
<P>
<I>But the lion's share of all the cost ... comes from the salaries
paid to more than 38-hundred employees. The problem is, taxpayers
are demanding more for less, and becoming far less willing to
pay. Even if the board gets it's five million dollars from the
unions; they will still have to find another six and a half million
in other areas ... to hold the line on taxes, in 1996. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Business First</H3>

<P>
Some expected economic data on US inflation and American retail
sales helped to stabilize financial markets in the US and Canada.

<P>
The Canadian dollar strengthened while interest rates eased.

<H3>Cuts - Hamilton </H3>

<P>
Six billion dollars in provincial spending cuts ...it's a figure
that has been tossed around for months... but it took until today
for the government to get specific about how it will affect the
operation of individual towns, cities and regions. And as Anthony
Pooley reports tonight... cuts to social services spending are
twice what the chairman of Hamilton Wentworth's Social Services
Committee thought they would be. 
<P>
<I>The Harris government has now answered the question many Ontarians
have been asking for months... where will the 6 billion dollars
in spending cuts come from? </I>
<P>
<I>Ten thousand public service jobs will be slashed; 17,000 single
parents and married couples who are full-time college or university
students will get student loans instead of welfare; tenants in
some public housing units will have rents increased to market
levels; 60 of 251 provincial parks will be closed; programs to
prevent violence against women will be cut by $2.9 million and
the Ontario Advisory Council on Women's Issues will be disbanded.
</I>
<P>
<I>The 900 million dollars in cuts to social services spending
is about twice the amount anticipated, says Hamilton- Wentworth's
Social Services Chairman. Ted McMeekin says that means cuts to
other programs in addition to welfare payments. He wants some
consultation. </I>
<P>
<I>Today's announcement comes about a month before Finance Minister
Ernie Eves hands down his first budget.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Downtown Taxes </H3>

<P>
Part of the Harris government's logic for slashing spending is
the promise to offer Ontarians a tax break. 
<P>
In Hamilton the subject of tax relief is very topical in the downtown
core. But this time its businesses looking for property tax relief.
Kathy Renwald reports on the plan to rejuvenate the downtown core.

<P>
<I>Inside a downtown Hamilton hotel the Grey Cup committee was
promising a splashy festival next November. But outside they face
a challenge to fizz up an ailing city core. </I>
<P>
<I>Co chair Marnie Paikin says all of Canada will be watching
Hamilton during Grey Cup week. So they will borrow some strategies
from last years host Regina. </I>
<P>
<I>The struggling businesses could be helped by tax relief. Lower
taxes in the downtown core and raise them elsewhere. But city
council sent the tax scheme packing ..sending it back to committee
for more study. </I>
<P>
<I>Sid Leon's heard it all before..he's operated a clothing store
on this James Street corner for 33 years. </I>
<P>
<I>But the Deputy Mayor of Stoney Creek says the suburbs would
be willing to pay for the revitalization of the downtown core
if the concept is marketed right. Grant Shaw firmly believes the
downtown is the hub of the region. </I>
<P>
<I>Back at the Grey Cup confab .. the football championship is
being touted as the start of the new Hamilton.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Jo Brant Layoffs </H3>

<P>
35 union employees of Joseph Brant Hospital in Burlington received
layoff notices today. Layoffs are effective October 11th for 27
registered practical nurses and eight other members of the Canadian
union of public employees. 
<P>
Another 100 CUPE employees who have low seniority also received
notices of potential layoff because they could be bumped by more
senior employees. It's expected that up to 50 nurses will be given
notice in May for July layoffs. 
<HR>

<H3>Halton Ed. Cuts </H3>

<P>
After a seven-hour marathon debate last night, Halton School trustees
were back at it again this afternoon, trying to nail down the
board's 96 operating budget. 
<P>
Members of the finance committee managed to cover half of the
sixty amendments last night aimed at trimming 16 million dollars
from the budget. Some of the proposals being considered include
staff lay-offs, reduced bussing and limiting equipment purchases.

<P>
The full board will likely vote on the 1996 operating budget early
next week. 
<HR>

<H3>Serial Rapist? </H3>

<P>
Police in Halton and Niagara are now downplaying media reports
that an attempted abduction and sexual assault of an 11 year old
girl in Niagara falls may have been committed by the man wanted
in a series of vicious assaults across southern Ontario. 
<P>
The girl was walking home from Centre Variety in the Falls when
she was pushed into a car by a man in his 20's. Police say the
child was sexually assaulted but the man let her go when she started
to scream. 
<P>
The description the girl gave police of her attacker is similar
to the description of a rapist being hunted by a Halton Police
task force. But while similarities exist police don't believe
it's the same man. 
<HR>

<H3>Most Wanted </H3>

<P>
Police in Hamilton have issued warrants for the arrest of a suspect
in a brutal assault and robbery that involved death threats. 
<P>
Jay Thomas Lewis is white, 30 years old, 6 foot-three and 190
pounds. He has short brown hair, blue eyes, a mustache and a tattoo
of a skull on his right shoulder. 
<P>
The victim of the assault at a Rebecca Street address last month
is still in hospital recovering from serious injuries. Police
believe Jay Thomas Lewis is still in the Hamilton area and urge
anyone with information to call Crime Stoppers. 
<HR>

<H3>Const. Accident </H3>

<P>
A Hamilton man is in hospital tonight after a freak industrial
accident. 
<P>
Michael Turco was working in a trench at the intersection of Victoria
and Burlington Streets, when he was struck in the back with a
concrete barricade. A mobile crane at street level was turning
when it accidentally knocked the chunk of concrete into the hole.

<P>
Mr. Turco was taken to hospital in good condition. The Ministry
of Labour is investigating. 
<HR>

<H3>Pelham Driver </H3>

<P>
Police have arrested and charged a man who cut a five kilometre
swath of destruction in Pelham early this morning. 
<P>
Police say the driver of a car drove on sidewalks and in ditches
while he mowed down garbage containers, mail boxes and small trees.
Garbage was strewn across lawns and roadways. 
<P>
The license plate of the offending vehicle was found at the scene.
Damage was pegged at five thousand dollars. Arrested and charged
with criminal negligence and mischief is 23 year old Christopher
Cram of Centennial Drive, Welland. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First</H3>

<P>
For the second day in a row there was more strong evidence that
Canadians are buying homes again. The sale of existing homes across
the country increased more than 40 per cent in march. 
<P>
Canadian stock prices and the dollar strengthened today.

<H3>Halton Board Budget</H3>

<P>
We begin with education tonight and cuts, lots more of them to
try to offset provincial funding cutbacks. 
<P>
Painful budget sessions are taking place within school boards
everywhere. The alternative would be a tax increase that nobody
seems to want. 
<P>
In Halton, its 16 million dollars in cuts from a 285 million dollar
budget just to hold the line. The finance committee has been meeting
this afternoon. 
<HR>

<H3>Ham. Board Meet </H3>

<P>
In Hamilton last night, a packed session at the Board of Education
offices as the finance committee grappled with a sixteen million
dollar budget cut. 
<P>
A thousand layoff notices went out to board employees in February.
Staff members and parents wanted to know what the trustees have
in mind. 
<P>
The full board won't vote on cuts until next week But last night
the committee approved some reductions that would chop forty six
and a half teaching positions, seven principal jobs and two and
a half administrative assistants. 
<P>
In other developments in education news, the Lincoln County Board
of Education has decided to end its junior kindergarten program.

<P>
The Norfolk Board has sent layoff notices to 85 employees, including
50 teachers. 
<P>
And now high school teachers are talking strike. Ontario Secondary
School Teachers' Federation President Earl Manners says bargaining
units unable to reach a deal should quickly take a strike vote.
The plan is to have as many teachers as possible across the province
in a strike position by September 1st. 
<HR>

<H3>Civics-Layoffs </H3>

<P>
Cuts continues to take their toll in health care. Hamilton Civic
Hospitals are calling it a worst case scenario that they hope
can be improved in the next six months. 125 support staff at the
civics were given layoff notices today. 
<P>
As Jamie West reports the hospitals are wrestling with tough provincial
budget cuts and they're hopeful that not all of the workers given
notice will actually end up losing their jobs. 
<P>
<I>Hamilton Civic Hospital officials announced the layoffs to
begin in six months, at the Hamilton General Division this morning.
Those departments affected include support staff, ward clerks,
housekeeping services, nutrition services as well as registered
technologists. </I>
<P>
<I>CUPE officials as expected are not happy... the civics had
expected to be working with 10 to 13 million dollars less in the
next fiscal year due to provincial cuts, but an additional unexpected
cut of 4 million dollars announced in February put added pressure
on management to reduce costs.</I>
<P>
<I>Meanwhile the civics are continuing discussions with the Ontario
Nurses Association. Nursing layoffs are also expected in the near
future.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>CAS Adoptions </H3>

<P>
A storm is brewing over the impact welfare cuts are having on
poor families. 
<P>
In Simcoe County the Children's Aid Society says two families
considered adopting out their children as a way of coping with
extreme poverty. But other child care agencies say that is a practice
that ended 40 years ago and has no place in today's society. Kathy
Renwald reports. 
<P>
<I>The director of Hamilton's Children's Aid Society says he has
not heard of any families forced by poverty to give up their kids.
But at Queens Park politicians are being grilled over the story
out of Simcoe County that poor families have considered giving
their kids up. Premier Mike Harris has a harder take on the story.
</I>
<P>
<I>But the reduction in economic support should never force families
to make such a dire choice to give them up according to Mainville.
As some families absorb welfare cuts..the Children's Aid Societies
juggle their own budgets after reductions. </I>
<P>
<I>Government cuts trimmed nearly 700 thousand from the Hamilton
CAS budget resulting in 10 staff cuts.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Miss. City Hall </H3>

<P>
Police arrested a man who was throwing furniture and fire hoses
out of the second-floor windows of City Hall in Mississauga early
today. 
<P>
Peel Region officers responded to an alarm inside the building
around 4 a.m. When they arrived, they found the man barricaded
inside. Police moved in around 5 a.m. and apprehended the man.
He faces numerous charges. 
<HR>

<H3>Robberies </H3>

<P>
Halton police are looking for a twice-lucky gunman who made off
with cash from a pair of shell stations last night. 
<P>
In both incidents, the man entered the kiosks, asked for cigarettes,
and then pulled a gun. No shots were fired and there were no injuries.

<P>
Police are looking for a 25 to 30 year old white male ...5-feet,
ten inches tall with long, light-colored hair. 
<HR>

<H3>Drugs </H3>

<P>
And, a couple of drug busts last night. 27 year old Horace Knight
of Hamilton faces trafficking charges after cocaine was sold to
a Halton undercover officer. 
<P>
And, an Oakville man, 20 year old Iain Fleming was picked up on
possession charges after a search warrant was executed at his
home. Police found drugs and money. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Stock prices in Canada and the dollar moved higher today while
US investors continued their selling. 
<P>
Stelco's Hilton Works is named by Chrysler as its best supplier
of steel. 
<P>
Philip environmental issues new stock while an investment firm
increases its control of Hamilton's Wescam to 10 per cent.

<HR>

<H3>Hamilton Air</H3>

<P>
For years Hamilton has been the brunt of nation wide jokes about
it's air quality. According to a new study Hamilton's air isn't
that great, but it's not as bad and in some cases even better
than a lot of industrial cities of the same size around the world.

<P>
The problem seems to be that the steel city still has an abnormally
high rate of respiratory problems as we hear in this report from
Jamie West.
<P>
<I>How much of this smoke spewing from Hamilton's industrial core
is getting into your lungs? Probably a lot right?... at St. Joseph's
Hospital Dr.'s Malcolm Sears and Fred Hargreave will team up to
try and find out the answer. </I>
<P>
<I>What the researchers do know is that of six Canadian cities
recently surveyed, Hamilton, despite placing lower for smoking
and allergies, placed first for those taking medication for asthma
at 8 percent of those surveyed and five percent had to change
jobs because of breathing problems. </I>
<P>
<I>The number of patients arriving at St. Joseph's Firestone Chest
and Allergy Unit is on the rise, but doctors say the problems
are not as simple as people working in buildings with poor air
circulation and dirty vents. </I>
<P>
<I>The next step... a new diagnostic test in which the patient
breathes in warm salt mist and then exhales forcefully will allow
for the collection of lung secretions, pinpointing the exact origin
of the respiratory problem.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Education Cuts </H3>

<P>
It's not so much the quality of the air but the quality of education
on the minds of some parents tonight ...... Scot Urquhart reports.

<P>
<I>It doesn't matter what program you're talking about ... no
one wants to cut: whether it's French immersion, junior kindergarten
or transportation programs for special education students.</I>
<P>
<I>Ellen Horak is no expert. She is an every day citizen, and
parent. Although she lives in Burlington, the issues she has considered
in dealing with the Halton Board, may provide some lessons in
Hamilton Wentworth as well.</I>
<P>
<I>When looking at the big picture in Hamilton, you start to get
an idea of what Ellen Horak is talking about. The Hamilton Board's
total budget is a whopping 269 million dollars. By comparison,
government cuts of six or seven million ... are a pittance. Even
cutting another 19.4 million dollars means that the total budget
is down by less than ten percent. </I>
<P>
<I>If you had to cut ten percent from your household budget; could
you do it?. Sue Giardano says she can, and did.  And would parents
be willing to pay more for transportation or special interest
programs? And Ellen Horak thinks therein: lies the ultimate answer.
let communities decide for themselves what to spend the money
on.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Blythe Protest</H3>

<P>
The village of Blythe, near London meanwhile, plans to stop collecting
education property taxes levied by school boards and has sent
letters seeking their protest to 754 municipalities across Ontario.

<P>
Reeve Mason Bailey says the revolt is aimed at provincial law
requiring municipalities to collect that portion of the property
tax. Bailey says a similar protest by farmers some three decades
ago led to the farm tax rebate program. 
<HR>

<H3>Workfare Reconsider </H3>

<P>
It's being described as a job killer and a punitive action against
poor people ... but it looks like Workfare is still a go in Hamilton
Wentworth. 
<P>
Regional councilors say they need to be at the table with the
province in order to mold a made in Hamilton solution to the problem.
Annette Hamm reports. 
<P>
<I>This delegation came to Hamilton Wentworth's Health and Social
Services Committee urging members to take the lead among other
municipalities and walk away from Workfare. But the region wants
to take the lead by working closely with the Ontario government
on its Workfare policy. </I>
<P>
<I>While it's highly unlikely the region will reconsider its Workfare
motion with the Ontario government, members of the Health and
Social Services Committee are open to suggestions on how to bring
the best possible Workfare options to Hamilton Wentworth. </I>
<P>
<I>Some of those suggestions may come from a Workfare forum being
held this Saturday at the Rotary Self Help Centre on West Avenue
in Hamilton. It begins at 1 o'clock.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Financial markets settled today after yesterday's volatile selloff
of stocks and bonds. 
<P>
The Canadian dollar and interest rates were stable Tuesday while
share prices in Toronto rose.

<H3>Niagara Abduction</H3>

<P>
In Niagara Falls, police are looking for a suspect in an attempted
abduction and sexual assault tonight. The incident last night
involved an 11 year old girl. 
<P>
The girl was walking home from Centre Variety store when she was
accosted by a man and forced into a vehicle parked behind the
building. Police say the suspect pushed her out of the car when
she screamed. He then drove westbound on Kitchener Street in a
dark colored, four door vehicle. 
<P>
The man is described as white, 19 years old, 5 foot 8, 180 pounds.
He had long brown hair in a ponytail and was wearing jeans and
a sweatshirt. Any one with any information is asked to call Niagara
Regional Police. 
<HR>

<H3>H &amp; R car </H3>

<P>
Ontario Provincial Police are asking for the public's assistance
in their investigation of the hit and run death of Constable Mike
Gula. Constable Gula was struck and killed by a sport utility
vehicle while he was standing on the shoulder of the QEW Tuesday
night. 
<P>
There is extensive damage to the vehicle's front end. Police are
seeking the public's help in tracking the movements of the that
vehicle on the night the officer was killed. 
<P>
Sixty seven year old Frank Vanderkley has been charged with failure
to remain at the scene of the accident in connection with Constable
Gula's death. Further charges may be laid. 
<HR>

<H3>Critical Accident </H3>

<P>
Yesterday's icy road conditions landed a Niagara Falls man in
Hamilton General Hospital in serious condition. 
<P>
The car driven by 53-year-old John Vanderlee crossed into on-coming
traffic on Morrison Street in Niagara Falls and struck a second
vehicle. That driver was treated for minor injuries. Police are
still trying to find out just what happened. 
<HR>

<H3>Cambridge Victim </H3>

<P>
A former Cambridge resident is listed as one of the 35 casualties
in Wednesday's plane crash in Croatia. 
<P>
54-four-year-old Robert Donovan, a past president of the engineering
firm Babcock and Wilcox, was among the business executives killed
when a plane carrying US Commerce Secretary Ron Brown crashed
into a mountainside near Dubrovnik. 
<P>
Officially, Donovan's status is &quot;whereabouts unknown.&quot;
He was listed on the flight register as president of ABB Incorporated
of Connecticut. 
<P>
Donovan was president of Babcock and Wilcox from 1985 to 1987.
The bodies of all victims have now been recovered and are being
flown back to the US. for identification.
<HR>

<H3>Good Friday Walk </H3>

<P>
Christians around the world were retracing the final steps of
Jesus Christ today. 
<P>
Hundreds turned out downtown St. Catharines this morning for the
annual Good Friday church walk. 
<P>
Congregations from each of Christian denominations participate
in the event. It's a traditional Good Friday service held outdoors
in the community. Participants walk from church to church stopping
to hear each pastor's Good Friday message. 
<P>
The walk is a remembrance of the trip Jesus took from Jerusalem
to the hill of Calvary. This is the 15th anniversary of the event.

<HR>

<H3>Burl. Food Drive </H3>

<P>
Volunteers with Burlington Food Share were busy today sorting
donations from the Easter food drive. 
<P>
The campaign runs until Monday ..donations are being accepted
at fire halls in Burlington and at supermarkets. In February 1,300
visits were made to food banks in Burlington, this Easter drive
will go to support the needs of the Salvation Army, and other
agencies in Burlington. Donations of canned fish and meat are
especially needed. 
<HR>

<H3>Ukrainian eggs </H3>

<P>
And a Burlington parking lot was full at 9.a.m with hundreds of
people waiting anxiously at the door. On sale were bread and eggs.
But those basic foodstuffs are transformed at the hands of Ukrainian
artists. Reporter Kathy Renwald joined the crowd at St. Mary's
church. 
<P>
<I>Ukrainian artists expected to sell eggs ..but not by the dozen.
But the appetite for these luxuriously crafted eggs was nearly
insatiable. As the eggs changed hands at the selling table ..an
artist demonstrated the work behind the creations..and talked
about their meaning. </I>
<P>
<I>The eggs were selling from 5 to 30 dollars. At another table
you couldn't even put your hands on the perogies advance orders
and early birds gobbled up all the available stock. </I>
<P>
<I>For three days members of the Ukrainian Catholic Women's League
occupy the kitchen at St. Mary's to cook for the sale. It's a
good fund raiser for the church. Another sale will be held in
June.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Easter Egg Hunt </H3>

<P>
A little further down the peninsula, hundreds of Grimsby-area
children got a head start on their hunt for Easter eggs today,
thanks to the Grimsby Kinsmen Club. 
<P>
The kinsmen staged their eighteenth annual Easter egg hunt in
the rose garden at Centennial Park. The lingering snow actually
made it a little easier to spot the chocolate treats. 
<P>
The event has grown so popular that for the first time this year,
the Grimsby Kinsmen enlisted the help of corporate sponsors to
defray costs. Seven-hundred children and a thousand adults turned
out last year, and despite the brisk temperatures, attendance
came close to that number today. 
<P>
The co-chairmen of the event, Frank Snow and Mark Wasilewski,
say the Easter egg hunt is the Kinsmen's way of saying thank you
to the town of Grimsby for its year-round support of Kinsmen fund-raisers.

<H3>Winter Weather</H3>

<P>
Enough is enough, that's the feeling of most southern Ontario
residents who woke up to another winter style blast from mother
nature. 
<P>
Snow mixed with freezing rain and ice pellets was whipped around
by gusty winds throughout the area.  The storm caught many off
guard and caused a number of problems not only with morning commuter
traffic, but with the things we take for granted in the morning
like Hydro and water. 
<P>
Sections of Hamilton mountain Ancaster, and some parts of Niagara
were without both because of a problem with a water pumping station
and high winds and ice weighing down power lines. Temperatures
expected to climb above the freezing mark this afternoon did not
materialize, and a number of accidents on area highways were touched
off as cold winds of lake Ontario picked up strength. 
<P>
One accident involved nearly a dozen vehicles on the westbound
403 near York Boulevard just after the noon hour. No word on any
injuries but traffic was delayed for several hours. As of air
time, there were still some reports of sporadic power outages
throughout the golden horseshoe. 
<HR>

<H3>New Orchestra(s) </H3>

<P>
How about a fanfare to greet spring when it finally arrives? And
how about two orchestras to play it? Today two groups are making
it known that they want to be suppliers of classical music in
the city but if Hamilton couldn't support one philharmonic, how
could they possibly back two?. Kathy Renwald reports on what could
be another musical maelstrom. 
<P>
<I>Boris Brott has been running a summer music festival in Hamilton
for 8 years. Now his group has asked for government funding to
form the new academy orchestra which could become this city's
replacement for the defunct philharmonic. </I>
<P>
<I>Bruce Hamilton is chairman of the board for the new orchestra.
But having Boris Brott step in to fill the Hamilton classical
musical scene is not what Robert Waxman has in mind. He's been
hand picked by the Smith Macdonald group to put their plan into
action to rebuild an orchestra. </I>
<P>
<I>But the new academy orchestra has already applied for government
funding.. the Waxman group hasnt.  Bruce Hamilton thinks that
holds the key to the future. Brott's group expects to hear a decision
on funding by mid April.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Cooke - Region </H3>

<P>
The fiscal realities of the nineties have forced Hamilton- Wentworth's
regional government to down-size its workforce, to re-organize
what's left, and to privatize many of its public services. But
when the dust settles, regional chairman Terry Cooke insists Hamilton-
Wentworth can emerge as an economic winner, if its citizens and
politicians are willing to embrace change. Deborah Walker reports
on Cooke's &quot;state of the region&quot; address, delivered
to the Hamilton Rotary Club today. 
<P>
<I>Hamilton- Wentworth's regional chairman says the dramatic change
the public sector is now experiencing, is nothing new to the private
sector. </I>
<P>
<I>Terry Cooke says Hamilton- Wentworth can emerge as an economic
winner, only if its government remains committed to creating safer
neighborhoods, a cleaner environment, and an effective transportation
infrastructure. And he says the region must work to reform the
punitive tax structure that is largely responsible for the decline
of downtown Hamilton. </I>
<P>
<I>Cooke also urged his audience to take a stand on the constituent
assembly's final recommendation to move to one-tier municipal
government in Hamilton- Wentworth. Cooke says blindly defending
the status quo is a recipe for mediocrity, when excellence is
possible. </I>
<HR>

<H3>UI Stats </H3>

<P>
Unemployment edged higher in the golden horseshoe over the last
couple of months. That's despite a lower national rate. 
<P>
After holding steady at 9.6 per cent in January and February,
Canada's unemployed level dropped to 9.3 per cent in March. But
a big reason for the drop is that thousands of people became discouraged
and stopped actively seeking employment. 
<P>
During march, the economy lost eight-thousand jobs, ending a three-month
job-creation surge. 
<HR>

<H3>Teacher Cuts </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, the Haldimand Board of Education is the latest to announce
major staff cuts to cope with reduced provincial funding. 
<P>
Fifty-three teachers are among 160 board employees to receive
layoff notices in the area south of Hamilton. All educators with
less than three years experience face layoff in June, while early
retirement is being offered to others. 
<P>
Education assistants, lunch supervisors, janitorial and administrative
staff make up the remainder of the job cuts. 
<HR>

<H3>Welfare Fraud </H3>

<P>
A police fraud squad has cracked a welfare scheme in Hamilton.

<P>
From December 1992 to December of last year, 38-thousand dollars
were collected by a suspect not entitled to benefits. Police say
he was using someone else's name. 
<P>
57 year old David Thomas of Hamilton faces two counts of fraud
over 1-thousand dollars and two counts of impersonation. 
<HR>

<H3>Business-First </H3>

<P>
Banks, government offices and financial markets will be closed
tomorrow for Good Friday. Financial markets finished the week
with stock prices and the value of the dollar moving lower while
interest rates remained stable. 
<P>
Canada's unemployment rate dropped in March, but that's because
a lot of young people left the work force. 
<HR>

<H3>Vanderkley Bail </H3>

<P>
The Niagara Falls man, charged in Tuesday nights hit-and-run death
of an OPP officer has been granted bail. 
<P>
67-year old frank Jacob Vanderkley was set free this afternoon
after signing a thousand dollar bond. He's to reappear in court
on failing to remain charges, May 2nd. 
<P>
Vanderkley turned himself in after an intense police search yesterday
for the driver of a vehicle which slammed into a police officer
knocking him into traffic on the Queen Elizabeth Way. 
<P>
52-year old Constable Michael Gula died from injuries sustained
in the accident. Funeral services are planned for him Saturday.

<HR>

<H3>Stewart ID'd. </H3>

<P>
Human remains found in Pelham, have now been positively identified.

<P>
Niagara Regional Police say the remains are those of Dawn Alaine
Stewart of Niagara falls and a six-month-old fetus. 
<P>
Stewart was last seen September 29th in Niagara falls, where she
was known to work as a prostitute. A hiker found the remains Sunday.

<HR>

<H3>Bernardo </H3>

<P>
A judge has ruled videotapes that show Paul Bernardo and Karla
Homolka torturing two girls should be destroyed when they are
no longer needed for legal purposes. Families of Kristen French
and Leslie Mahaffy had gone to court in an effort to keep the
tapes out of public view. 
<P>
In a written ruling, Justice Patrick Gravely said he has no hesitation
in accepting evidence that the tapes can be classified as pornography
of the worst kind. The families' lawyer, Tim Danson, says the
two remaining copies of the tapes will be kept in safe keeping,
likely until Bernardo's death. The tapes are still needed , however,
in several pending court cases.
<HR>

<H3>Sportsman Lanes Fire </H3>

<P>
Hamilton fire crews were called out to the building that used
to house the Sportsman's Bowling Lanes on Charlton Avenue just
after 10-thirty this morning. 
<P>
It took nearly an hour to get what fire officials describe as
a well involved basement fire under control. The building has
been vacant for several years and no one was hurt. 
<P>
Damage is pegged at nearly 40-thousand dollars. The Fire Marshall
is investigating the cause of the blaze. 
<HR>

<H3>Key Theft </H3>

<P>
A suspicious car has prompted police in Hamilton to lay a rare
criminal charge. 
<P>
A patrol sergeant had turned around to follow a Honda Accord but
by the time he found it, the driver had taken off, leaving the
car running. The suspect was arrested nearby, where police also
found two other Honda Accords, both with the ignition punched
out. 
<P>
18 year old Khong Yong of no fixed address is charged with possession
of a master key. More charges are expected to be laid.
<HR>

<H3>St. Joes Research </H3>

<P>
St. Joseph's Health Care System, an alliance of five facilities
in central Ontario announced a unique research network today.

<P>
The Father Sean O'Sullivan Research Centre at Hamilton's St. Joseph's
Hospital will work with hospitals in Brantford, Kitchener and
Guelph. 
<P>
The first order of business for the network will be to focus on
the study of aging and the elderly and to place an emphasis on
creating a continuum of care between the community and the hospital.

<H3>Death Follow</H3>

<P>
Police have made an arrest in the hit and run death of OPP. Constable
Michael Gula. 
<P>
The arrest was announced at a news conference late this afternoon.
Constable Gula was struck on the QEW in Niagara Falls last night,
just months away from retirement. 
<HR>

<H3>Hamilton Arrest </H3>

<P>
Police from Quebec, raided an apartment on Queen Street North
in Hamilton, last night; and, with the assistance of Hamilton
Wentworth Regional Police; arrested a suspect wanted for two murders
in St. Eustache, Quebec. 
<P>
The victims, were a middle aged couple, whose bodies were found
in their home, in august 1993. Charged in connection with the
deaths; is 38 year old Ronald Kelly Simon, of Hamilton. Simon
was held in custody overnight, and returned to Quebec this afternoon,
to face charges. 
<HR>

<H3>Ride-Stolen </H3>

<P>
A pair of car thieves took the wrong way home last night. 
<P>
Just twenty minutes after picking up a sports car in Stoney Creek,
they ran into a police Ride program on Hamilton mountain. The
pair was arrested when officers noticed the car's ignition had
been punched and the driver still had a screwdriver in his lap.

<P>
Jointly charged with theft and possession over 5-thousand dollars
are 21 year old Mark Fothergill and 19 year old Tanya Hutchinson,
both of Hamilton. Fothergill is also charged with possession of
burglary tools. 
<HR>

<H3>1005 Rejects Deal </H3>

<P>
The result is as close as the Quebec Referendum, but steelworkers
at Stelco's Hilton Works have turned down an early contract agreement.
The deal would have given union members improvements to their
pension and a cost of living allowance increase, but no wage hikes.
Now the deal is null and void. Annette Hamm reports. 
<P>
<I>9 votes are all that separated steelworker's local 10-0-5 and
Stelco's Hilton Works from a six year contract. It's a deal that
would have seen pensions increase by 240 dollars a month. The
union needed a 51 per cent acceptance to ratify the deal, they
had 49-point-86. And just as the vote is split almost 50 50, so
is the union membership. </I>
<P>
<I>About half of the nearly 5-thousand workers the union represents,
have more than 30 years of service and can retire immediately,
the other half can't. After spending three months hammering out
the deal, both the union executive and Hilton Works say they're
disappointed with the outcome. </I>
<P>
<I>Bob Jones, the director of human resources says there weren't
customers hanging on the vote results, but a long term contract
would benefit both the company and the membership.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Welfare Study </H3>

<P>
Two-thousand people disappeared from Hamilton- Wentworth's welfare
rolls between October, when the Tories cut benefits twenty-two
per cent, and the end of last year. And Hamilton- Wentworth's
Social Planning and Research Council wants to know why. 
<P>
In order to answer the question, social planners hope to conduct
confidential interviews with as many of those two-thousand people
as possible. If you're willing to take part in the study, you
can drop by the Social Planning and Research Council at 255 West
Avenue North in Hamilton, and pick up a questionnaire. Or you
can simply call the Council at 522-1148, and give your answers
over the phone. 
<P>
The council hopes to release the findings of its study in June.

<HR>

<H3>Workfare Pilot </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, Hamilton- Wentworth wants to be a pilot site for the
provincial government's Workfare program. Councilors voted last
night to apply to become one of 15 test sites. 
<P>
Social Services Commissioner Mike Shuster says there could be
three million dollars in it for the region. Some 5-thousand general
welfare recipients in Hamilton- Wentworth would be involved. 
<P>
Shuster says a made in Hamilton -Wentworth solution could ensure
that the program is humane and best for the people here. Workfare
is supposed to provide welfare recipients with some form of training,
part-time or volunteer work.
<HR>

<H3>Constituent Recs. </H3>

<P>
Hamilton- Wentworth taxpayers could save tens of millions of dollars
if regional councilors are willing to accept grass roots proposals
for municipal government reform. 
<P>
The constituent assembly, created a year ago to fulfill a campaign
promise by Regional Chairman Terry Cooke, presented its final
report to a special committee meeting this afternoon. Deborah
Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>Hamilton- Wentworth's constituent assembly recommends abolishing
Regional Council, the six local councils and their bureaucracies,
and replacing them with one municipal administration, one municipal
council with no more than thirty members plus a chairman, and
an unspecified number of community committees. </I>
<P>
<I>The CA wants to eliminate Hamilton- Wentworth's &quot;city
versus the suburbs mentality&quot;, by recommending more balanced
representation on the new super council. </I>
<P>
<I>The constituent assembly believes its recommendations will
produce a more accountable, more efficient, more cost-effective
municipal government. </I>
<P>
<I>If it rejects the constituent assembly's proposals, regional
councilors risk inviting the province to dictate terms for reform.</I>

<HR>

<H3>HRCA Cuts </H3>

<P>
Faced with a 1-point-4 million dollar funding shortfall this year,
the Hamilton Region Conservation Authority is having to conserve
a lot of money. 
<P>
The authority has had to re-evaluate its mandate, meaning some
environmental services will be reduced to eliminated, but its
watershed management will not be abandoned. 
<P>
By the middle of next year, 9 of 60 full time positions will be
gone, and seasonal staff wages will be cut by 10 per cent. Gate
fees at several conservation areas will be increased by 1-dollar
per vehicle, and visitors to the Dundas Valley Conservation Area
will be charged a daily entry fee. 
<HR>

<H3>Business-First </H3>

<P>
Canadian stock prices moved lower today along with the value of
the dollar. 
<P>
Diamond Fields Resources said it will accept the four and a half
billion dollar takeover offer from Inco. 
<P>
Dropping oil inventories are pushing gasoline prices higher.

<H3>1005 Vote</H3>

<P>
As striking Ontario civil servants return to their jobs and other
union leaders threaten strike action, a different story tonight
about Hamilton steelworkers. 
<P>
The five thousand members of local 1005 and Stelco reached an
early tentative agreement on a long-term contract that if accepted,
will take Canada's largest steelmaker through the next six years.

<HR>

<H3>Regional Budget </H3>

<P>
Regional councilors in Hamilton Wentworth stamped their final
budget today and it means a nine dollar increase on the regional
portion of the property tax bill. 
<P>
As Kathy Renwald reports, most councilors felt it would be too
painful to bring in a zero per cent increase. 
<P>
<I>There could be more potholes and maybe fewer flower pots as
the bottom line of the regional budget. Hamilton Wentworth regional
councilors looked over the final figures today and approved a
further five per cent cut in funding to the Royal Botanical Gardens.
The Regional Police will defer hiring another 25 officers until
1997.. and a 1. 5 million dollar reduction in maintenance to regional
roads was approved. </I>
<P>
<I>But staff promised those cuts wont be noticible..the money
will be saved through productivity improvements.. and whats not
saved there.. will be made up by dipping into the reserve budget
for snow removal. </I>
<P>
<I>Councilor Bob Charters among others found that cost saving
plan vague. An extra inning motion was promoted by Regional Chairman
Terry Cooke.. who wants to see people using the regional transfer
stations charged a user fee. </I>
<P>
<I>Staff said that would generate over 300 thousand in extra revenue..
but the scheme was lost on a tie vote. The final budget passed
brought in a 1.6 per cent increase ..amounting to about 9 dollars
more on the regional portion of the property tax bill.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Resale Hamilton </H3>

<P>
The Hamilton area housing market is off to a strong start this
year and will continue to strengthen through 1997. 
<P>
In its spring forecast, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation
says the sale of existing homes will reach 84-hundred this year
and rise by about nine per cent next year to 86-hundred units.
Moderate mortgage rates and low unemployment in the Hamilton area
are luring buyers back into the housing market. 
<HR>

<H3>Seaway Opens</H3>

<P>
The Welland Canal is open for another shipping season. 
<P>
St. Lawrence Seaway president Glendon Stewart presented the traditional
top hat to the captain of the year's first ship through the waterway
at lock number three this morning. It's the canal's 168th season.
And, says Stewart, the St. Lawrence seaway may soon be operating
more like a private business. 
<HR>

<H3>Business-First </H3>

<P>
More big gains in stock markets today as the Canadian dollar and
interest rates remain stable. 
<P>
Canada's big cable companies are forming an alliance to take on
the phone companies in a battle for high speed data and voice
transmission markets. 
<HR>

<H3>Drug Bust </H3>

<P>
A joint forces drug raid this morning has netted police about
half a million dollars worth of drugs, cash and property. 
<P>
20 people have been arrested after police raided a number of homes
in Hamilton, Stoney Creek and Toronto. Police say with the raids,
they have effectively shut down two cocaine operations with roots
in Venezuela. 
<P>
Investigators say the rings had the potential to make quite an
impact on the drug market. 
<HR>

<H3>Burned Body Arrest </H3>

<P>
Police have arrested a man in connection with the murder of Sinniah
Rajan Mamankaran two years ago. 
<P>
The victim's charred body was discovered on the side of Tufford
Road in Beamsville in July, 1994. Investigators believe the Sri
Lankan immigrant was abducted from a Mississauga parking lot hours
before he was killed. 
<P>
Charged with kidnapping, forcible confinement and first degree
murder is 29 year old Nehruji Natkunam of Toronto. 
<HR>

<H3>Gentles Mother</H3>

<P>
The mother of a Kingston Penitentiary inmate who died after a
confrontation with jail guards was back in court today. 
<P>
Carmeta Gentles is trying to get charges against the guards reinstated.
The Attorney General withdrew the charges of manslaughter against
the six guards. The court was to hear arguments today and tomorrow.

<P>
Robert Gentles died in October 1993 after being dragged from his
cell and maced. 
<HR>

<H3>Pelham Bones Update </H3>

<P>
Niagara Region Police say the human remains found in a field near
St. Catharines are those of a pregnant woman. 
<P>
The grisly discovery was made Sunday afternoon by a hiker in Pelham.
Investigators say they are checking missing persons reports in
hopes of identifying the woman. Foul play has not been ruled out.

<HR>

<H3>Copps - Teacher </H3>

<P>
This woman has been honored for her special efforts. Holly Garrett,
a special education teacher at Parkdale Public School in east
Hamilton, has been given a Prime Minister's award for teaching
excellence in science, technology and mathematics. 
<P>
Mrs. Garrett has hooked up her class so they're interactive with
the Jason project as it explores the world underwater. They started
studying the project when it was working on the Hamilton Scourge
warships back in 1990. 
<HR>

<H3>Barton - Arrest</H3>

<P>
And over at Hamilton's Barton Secondary School, quite a commotion
this afternoon. 
<P>
English teacher Steve Kennedy was arrested and charged with truancy,
and vagrancy inside the school cafeteria. The prank was a ploy
by the student council to raise enough money to bail Mr. Kennedy
out of jail, and help support the upcoming Mothers Day Telethon
in support of Chedoke McMaster Children's Hospital. 
<P>
The students managed to raise 145-dollars in spare change. And
Constable Rob (my-yay) ran into a little resistance as he loaded
Mr. Kennedy into his cruiser to be booked. 
<HR>

<H3>HW Enviro Update </H3>

<P>
There was an environmental jam session of sorts at Hamilton City
Hall today. 
<P>
Groups involved in environmental issues gathered to present status
reports on where Hamilton stands as a sustainable community. The
purpose was to update regional politicians on Hamilton achievements
in cleaning up the environment. 
<P>
The region has won several international awards on efforts to
balance the environment with economic issues.

<H3>Workfare Demo</H3>

<P>
They think it's a joke, a bad one at that, and they chose April
1st to make their point. 
<P>
A consortium of Hamilton social agencies say Workfare is not fair.
They staged a march and rally late this afternoon to show their
outrage to the Mike Harris government plan to make welfare recipients
work for their benefits. 
<P>
The protesters, including church workers, child care activists
and university members were also demonstrating against the Canada
assistance program. They marched from the Employment Canada offices
at King William and Wellington to Gore Park, proclaiming Workfare
is salve labour and threatens union jobs. 
<HR>

<H3>Back to Work </H3>

<P>
The end to OPSEU's five week strike is being met not only with
a collective bargaining agreement, but also with a collective
sigh of relief, and today workers and management in government
offices across the province set out to catch up on unfinished
business that had piled up during the work stoppage. Jamie West
reports.... 
<P>
<I>Despite a scene that looks like the remnants of a war zone
outside the Hamilton Psychiatric Hospital... the fact is the war
is over and all that's left of the Ontario public service union's
first strike are a few empty chairs, a couple of cooled off steel
drums and a quiet trailer.</I>
<P>
<I>Management and staff are friends again... the story was very
much the same at Burlington's Ministry of Transportation office
where workers beamed as they went back to work. </I>
<P>
<I>At Hamilton's Ellen Fairclough Building employees, management
and the public moved in and out with ease...for the first time
in five weeks. Hamilton land registrar Elgin Farewell couldn't
be happier... the backlog of registrations is significant both
for real estate transactions and for companies seeking to incorporate
and it will take time to clear.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Strike Warning </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, one union leader is warning of more strikes. The Bob
Rae government's social contract which froze wages and forced
workers to take unpaid days off expired at midnight last night.

<P>
CUPE Ontario president Sid Ryan says if his members walk out,
it will be more noticeable than the OPSEU strike. 
<P>
CUPE represents workers at hospitals, school boards and social
agencies, and garbage collectors. 
<HR>

<H3>Teenager Dies </H3>

<P>
A teenage driver involved in a police chase two weeks ago in St.
Catharines has died from his injuries. 
<P>
Sixteen year old Kenneth Miller was driving a stolen van that
crashed into a utility pole on Queenston Street. Two other passengers
were injured. The province's special investigation unit is investigating.

<HR>

<H3>Pelham Bones </H3>

<P>
Niagara Regional Police Investigators are still on the scene in
rural Pelham where the partial skeleton of a woman has been found.
A child made the gruesome discovery and as Lauran Sabourin reports,
it could be another day before the remains are removed. 
<P>
<I>Investigators cordon off the area, preparing to scour what
may be a homicide crime scene. .. the remains belong to a woman.
Police are still not sure of her age. A skull lies about 30 feet
from the carcass. The feet have been arms have disappeared, probably
carried off by animals who have been gnawing at the bones. </I>
<P>
<I>Two neighbourhood dogs who were romping through the crime scene
were rounded up and locked in the back of a police cruiser. White
flags mark the area where bone fragments have been found. </I>
<P>
<I>The remains will be taken to Hamilton to be closely examined
for any clues that to how the woman died. Investigators will begin
scouring the scene, while identification officers try to determine
the identity of the woman.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Mystery Body </H3>

<P>
Halton police have either a macabre April fools joke or a bizarre
homicide on their hands. 
<P>
Their appealing for anyone who may have a car stopped on Highway
401 near Highway 6 Sunday evening to contact them. It's the latest
in a story that began last evening after some witnesses reported
seeing the driver of a dark coloured jaguar dump a human body
into the car's trunk or onto the shoulder of the road. 
<P>
The car was found and the driver questioned and today the car
was to be examined for forensic evidence. An extensive search
of the area yesterday, failed to turn up any body. 
<HR>

<H3>Canatom Demo </H3>

<P>
A nuclear waste transfer station is now up and running in Oakville,
and some residents aren't very happy about it. 
<P>
A group of people, calling themselves &quot;Citizens Organized
for Responsible Process&quot;, gathered outside the Canatom plant
to protest its opening. Canatom will handle everything from contaminated
gloves, syringes and lab coats to by products of cat scans and
x-rays. 
<P>
The protesters are concerned because the nuclear waste storage
facility is located close to a densely populated residential area
and several schools.

<H3>Hamilton Pickets </H3>

<P>
Good evening. The haggling continues. This time last night we
were telling you an end to the OPSEU strike was imminent. But
24 hours later, negotiators for striking Ontario public servants
and the Harris government remain huddled over a Toronto bargaining
table ... trying to hammer out the final details of a tentative
agreement that would end the 5-week old strike by provincial workers.

<P>
But a stumbling block remains... the disagreement now is over
whether workers designated essential who refused to work should
be disciplined. On picket lines in Hamilton today, meanwhile,
there was an air of hope and optimism... as Anthony Pooley reports.

<P>
<I>For these workers, it has been day after day of walking picket
line duty in front of the Ellen Fairclough building... walking
the line despite the weather and just about anything else. They
are, at once, both weary and energized... weary of the strike
and its effect on them... but energized by word of the status
of negotiations. </I>
<P>
<I>And there has been suffering... at the Hamilton- Wentworth
Detention Centre they are not only strike weary... but weary of
the extra scrutiny under which corrections officers found themselves...
a portion of them compelled to work amid the heightened danger
of skeleton staffing. </I>
<P>
<I>They are... not surprisingly... sensitive to media coverage
and suspicious of news media... but one young corrections officer
sums up the personal adversity faced by many during the work stoppage.
And there is the hope that very soon, they will be back doing
their jobs. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Hamilton Orchestra </H3>

<P>
It will take a million dollars, wage concessions from musicians,
and zero tolerance for deficits in order to breathe life back
into the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra. Today, members of the
task force investigating Hamilton's ability to support a philharmonic
orchestra outlined a twelve-step plan for a musical revival. Deborah
Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>The co-chairmen of the task force bluntly explain what caused
the demise of the 113-year-old Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra.
They're equally blunt in explaining what it will take to bring
music back to the city. A new board and management who won't tolerate
the accumulation of any deficit. </I>
<P>
<I>A half-million dollars in private donations, and another half-million
in advanced subscription ticket sales. All ticket revenues must
be held in trust, and not squandered on operating expenses. Musicians
must give up any claim to wages lost under the former HPO, and
negotiate a new, less lucrative contract with the new orchestra.
</I>
<P>
<I>The new orchestra will need rent relief at Hamilton Place,
and grants from all three level of governments, including Hamilton-
Wentworth region. But the region has already used this year's
orchestra grant to cover losses it sustained paying off the old
HPO's debts. </I>
<P>
<I>Even if every one of these conditions are met, the task force
believes a new orchestra cannot survive in the long-term, unless
it co-operates with other local orchestras to form a regional
philharmonic. And the co-chairmen suggest it may be necessary
for government agencies to force struggling orchestras to regionalize,
by making regional affiliations mandatory in order to qualify
for grant money. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Public Salaries</H3>

<P>
Have you ever wondered what some of the top administrators in
hospitals, colleges or city hall are paid? Well as of Sunday you
have the legal right to know. That's when Ontario's new public
sector salary disclosure act officially kicks in, but as Jamie
West discovered today many institutions have already released
their numbers.... 
<P>
<I>Since the cost of healthcare is one of the hottest topics in
the news lately let's begin there. In 1995 the Hamilton Civic
Hospitals (the Henderson and the General combined) had 27 people
on their payroll earning better than 100-thousand dollars. Topping
the list is Dr. David McCutcheon the President and CEO earning
just under 230-thousand dollars a year. Dr. M.H. Malik a nuclear
medicine specialist pulled in almost 176-thousand... and Dr. J.H.
Thornley a laboratory physician earned over 171-thousand dollars.
</I>
<P>
<I>Across town at Chedoke McMaster Hospitals the top salary went
to President and CEO Dr. Jennifer Jackman at 281 thousand dollars.
Close behind is Dr. Sat Somers a radiologist with a salary of
over 269-thousand. Third on the list is Dr. Geoffrey Coates at
just over 244-thousand dollars a year. </I>
<P>
<I>On to McMaster University itself. In 1995 there were 82 people
earning over 100-thousand dollars a year. World renowned Dr. John
Bienenstock tops the list at nearly 207-thousand dollars a year.
President and Vice Chancellor Peter George earned 180-thousand,
while his predecessor Geraldine Kenney Wallace pulled in over
178 thousand dollars herself. </I>
<P>
<I>At Mohawk College one name appears on the list...the top man
himself Keith McIntyre...making just over 126-thousand dollars
last year. </I>
<P>
<I>And at City Hall there are seven people in the top category
starting with... Patrice Noe-Johnson at 128 thousand dollars a
year. Hamilton's Public Works Commissioner came in second at 118-thousand
dollars... and Hamilton CAO Joseph Pavelka earned over 117 thousand
dollars.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Suspect Suicide </H3>

<P>
A suspect who died in his St. Catharines police cell hours after
he was charged with attempted murder hanged himself using his
own belt. 
<P>
Ontario's Special Investigations Unit says autopsy results show
Donald Yacura, 43, died of asphyxiation. He was found hanging
in his cell Wednesday night. 
<P>
Yacura, a father of two who was separated from his wife and lived
in Hamilton, also had been charged with unlawful confinement.
He was caught fleeing from the home of a woman who managed to
call 911 Wednesday morning after being taken captive in her home.

<HR>

<H3>Heroine Bust </H3>

<P>
A joint two-month undercover investigation by Halton Police and
the RCMP has resulted in the arrest of a Burlington man. 
<P>
The operation began in January when a suspect on parole from a
Hamilton half-way house sold heroine to an undercover officer
at Burlington's Mapleview mall. Charged is: 48-year-old Vincenzo
James Pitaro. 
<HR>

<H3>Dope </H3>

<P>
Cayuga OPP have busted what they say was an elaborate hydroponic
marijuana-growing operation. 
<P>
Their raid on a rural York house netted more than 560 plants and
18 pounds of cannabis. Charged with a number of drug and weapons-related
offenses is 43 year old john Krywokulsky. 
<HR>

<H3>403 Rollover </H3>

<P>
A bit of a slow drive in for anyone traveling Highway 403 westbound
in Hamilton. A van flipped over near the Main Street West exit
during this morning's rush hour. Police say the female driver
was not seriously injured. 
<P>
Two lanes were blocked for a while as rescue crews moved the van
out of the way.
<HR>

<H3>Car Theft </H3>

<P>
Last year nearly 57-hundred vehicles were stolen in Hamilton Wentworth.
That's up 160 per cent over the previous three years, and many
of the cars stolen were used by teens for joyriding. 
<P>
It's the aim of this group of 15 federally funded students to
stop auto theft through prevention. Over the next seven months,
they'll be targeting high risk 12 to 17 year olds through a mentor
program, trying to convince them car theft is not a game. 
<HR>

<H3>Business-First</H3>

<P>
Canada's economy grew at a stronger rate than was expected during
January. That latest evidence of economic expansion in Canada
helped the dollar strengthen by more than a quarter of a penny
today. 
<P>
And Cara Foods, has agreed to buy controlling interest in Canada's
biggest specialty coffee shop chain.

<H3>Strike Over?</H3>

<P>
Good evening. The four and a half week old civil service strike
could end tonight. That according to OPSEU President Leah Casselman
who says it's all but over now and a tentative agreement is only
hours away. 
<P>
Casselman says the only unresolved issue is the return to work
protocol. Thousands of jail guards, hospital workers and other
government employees have been manning the picket lines and tensions
mounted during a protest at Queen's Park today once again. but
the prospect of a tentative deal comes as welcome news to these
OPSEU members manning the line at the government building on King
Street West in Hamilton. 
<HR>

<H3>Death in Custody</H3>

<P>
The province's special investigations unit is probing the death
of a man while in the custody of the Niagara Regional Police service
last night. 
<P>
The man, 43 had been arrested earlier on charges of attempted
murder and unlawful confinement and was found unconscious in his
cell at 11 Division, St. Catharines. His identity has not been
released pending notification of next of kin. 
<P>
Yesterday, a man, aged 43 was arrested on the same charges after
a dramatic call to 9-1-1 from a Beamsville address. A woman was
heard crying and whimpering and the operator also heard a male
voice in the background. Police arrested a man after what they
are calling a very violent struggle that injured the officer and
the suspect. A woman was found unconscious lying a bed, bound
and gagged. Constable Donald Laing removed the duct tape and she
revived. 
<P>
Donald Yacura of Hamilton was charged and was to appear in court
this morning. police will not say if the incidents are related.

<HR>

<H3>Media Ban </H3>

<P>
A major disappointment for the families of Paul Bernardo's murder
victims Kristen French and Debbie Mahaffy. 
<P>
The Supreme Court of Canada has denied their request to take part
in a hearing on closed courtrooms. Justice Peter Cory said in
his ruling that he recognized the grief of the families of Kristen
French and Leslie Mahaffy. But he said hearing from the families
would not help the court. 
<P>
The case before the Supreme Court could have a wide affect on
the media's ability to report on sex-offense cases. 
<HR>

<H3>Access Crash </H3>

<P>
Police say alcohol was a factor in a serious crash on a Hamilton
mountain access last night. 
<P>
A car going up the Kenilworth access and a car doing down collided
head on around 9 o'clock. A passenger in the downbound car is
in serious condition, the driver is fair. The driver of the upbound
vehicle is in critical condition. 
<P>
The access was closed for three hours. charges are expected. 
<HR>

<H3>Fortino's Update </H3>

<P>
A large west Hamilton supermarket is back in business, a day after
an explosion and fire caused 600-thousand dollars damage. 
<P>
A group of about 50 Fortino's workers spent the night tossing
out food contaminated by smoke, and cleaning every inch of their
store at the Dundurn Plaza. They were still doing a few last minute
clean ups moments before the store reopened this morning. A propane
cylinder is believed to have touched off the explosion. 
<HR>

<H3>Man Found </H3>

<P>
A Burlington man reported missing earlier this week is back home
safe and sound. 
<P>
20-year-old Jeremy Jones had left home on his bicycle Saturday
morning and hadn't been heard from since. Well a Toronto police
officer recognized Jeremy from a missing person poster. It seems
his bicycle had been stolen and he was unable to get back to Burlington.

<P>
Jeremy requires several types of medication and there were fears
for his health and safety. 
<HR>

<H3>Strange Robber </H3>

<P>
Police can't explain it, but they're thankful a robber in Thorold
gave them advance warning early today. Investigators say the man
walked into a doughnut shop, pulled out a big knife, and told
the clerk to call police because she was being robbed. She did,
and the cops arrested the suspect just outside the store. 
<HR>

<H3>Grants Committee </H3>

<P>
From the Wesley Drop-in Centre, to women's waterpolo... fifty
groups and organizations will share 234-thousand dollars in grants
approved by Hamilton City Council today. 
<P>
That's well short of the million-dollars worth of grants requested.
But the combination of provincial cutbacks and a city tax freeze
left the grants budget about thirty-thousand dollars lower than
last year. 
<HR>

<H3>Civic Briefing </H3>

<P>
After all the controversy over the Hamilton Health Task Force
Report, another hospital committee is looking for public input.

<P>
The Transition Committee of Chedoke McMaster and Hamilton Civic
Hospitals was set up before the task force report was released,
and it looking at merging their facilities into one hospital with
one board and one chief executive officer. Annette Hamm reports.

<P>
<I>The Transition Committee has been working towards merging Chedoke
McMaster and Hamilton Civic Hospitals since late last year. Now
they're updating the public on the where they stand. </I>
<P>
<I>By this time next year, Chedoke McMaster and the civics will
be one, creating one of Canada's largest hospitals. Joining forces
will help both boards use shrinking health care and research dollars
more effectively. Only one CEO will run the merged hospitals,
and buying power for supplies could be increased. </I>
<P>
<I>The Transition Committee is leaving budget issues and staffing
problems to the new, as yet unnamed hospital. It's not touching
any issues arising from the task force report, namely the suggestion
that the Sisters of St. Joseph take control of the Henderson Hospital
from the Civics board. The committees only concern is making the
merger of the Hamilton Civic and Chedoke McMaster hospitals a
reality.</I>
<P>
<I>The transition committee hopes to make its recommendations
by June, and have the merger complete by December. If you have
any questions or ideas you can call the merger hotline at area
code 905, 527-3545, or you can fax the committee at 905, 577-8025.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Business-First </H3>

<P>
Hamilton steel maker Dofasco says it will add eleven to 13 million
dollars of gross income to its balance sheet in the first quarter
of this year. The newfound money is recovered from deposits on
anti dumping duties paid to the united states.

<H3>Court - Bomb</H3>

<P>
Good evening. Police have determined a suspicious package found
in the downtown Hamilton Provincial Courthouse is a bomb. Main
Street East is closed this hour between John and Walnut. 
<P>
<I>It was around ten thirty in the morning ... when a call came
into the regional clerk's office ... the result ... chaos on main
street. </I>
<P>
<I>The main artery of the city was blocked by police barricades;
and traffic slowed to a crawl. The Provincial Courthouse was evacuated
... and some 30 prisoners who had business before the court; were
removed; remanded, and returned to jail. </I>
<P>
<I>Anxious OPSEU workers ... picketing on the street, looked on
in dismay... many believing that they would be blamed for the
incident. </I>
<P>
<I>Police meanwhile, working on the assumption that they were
looking for three bombs rolled in the bomb squad... and specially
trained officers searched the courts; eventually turning up one
suspicious package in the men's washroom, on the second floor.
That discovery prompted police to begin the cautious, and time
consuming ritual; of remote robotic retrieval.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Fortino's Blast </H3>

<P>
The structural damage is relatively minor, but the food losses
are huge after an explosion and fire at a Fortino's supermarket
in west Hamilton overnight. As Annette Hamm tells us, close to
half a million dollars in perishable goods may have to be thrown
out before the store reopens tomorrow. 
<P>
<I>Marsha Mino won't be getting her groceries at Fortino's today.
Her supermarket with a heart is covered with a thin veil of soot.
</I>
<P>
<I>Five workers were stocking shelves overnight when they heard
a blast at the back of the store. they made it out safely after
calling the fire department. </I>
<P>
<I>A year ago, 2-and-a half million dollars were poured into this
store, making it the first Fortino's superstore in the chain.
Now they'll spend 300 to 500-thousand dollars to replace damaged
goods. </I>
<P>
<I>The Environmental Health Branch Director has ordered all produce,
dairy and bulk products and some grocery items to be disposed
of because of smoke damage. </I>
<P>
<I>A store official won't tell us how much closing for the day
will cost him, but stresses he worries more about inconvenienced
customers than lost sales.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Sulphur Springs Fire </H3>

<P>
An investigator with the Fire Marshall's Office is probing a fire
at an empty house in Ancaster last night. 
<P>
Arson is believed to be the cause. The two story wooden home was
partially gutted, and damage is estimated at 60-thousand dollars.

<HR>

<H3>B &amp; E Warning</H3>

<P>
After a series of similar break-ins on Hamilton's west mountain,
police are warning residents to make sure their doors and windows
are locked, even when they are home. 
<P>
In the past month, there have been 9 break-ins in a neighbourhood
near Upper Paradise and two more in the scenic woods subdivision.
The thieves get in through doors or windows, usually while the
homeowners are sleeping, and grab electronics and cash. 
<HR>

<H3>Johnson - Demo </H3>

<P>
He's become one Hamilton Wentworth region's most controversial
figures, and today, Health Action Task Force chairman Dr. Ray
Johnson spoke publicly about his groups report for the first time
since it's release three weeks ago. 
<P>
As Jamie West reports, Johnson had a welcoming committee that
included a number of angry healthcare workers.... 
<P>
<I>This was about all the applause ray Johnson could muster during
his lunchtime presentation to members of McMaster University's
Alumni Association. </I>
<P>
<I>Johnson spent twenty minutes reviewing the process and recommendations
contained in the Health Action Task Force report ....among them
the closure of St. Joseph's Hospital and the Hamilton Psychiatric
Hospital. </I>
<P>
<I>CUPE took the opportunity to feast on what they see as the
report's lack of credibility... demanding more time for union
and public input ... other stakeholders like St. Joseph's board
member Gordon Dean kept up the heat... afterward Johnson said
the task force is willing to talk to labour groups separately,
but an open forum is out...</I>
<HR>

<H3>Nia. School Layoffs </H3>

<P>
Government cuts to education taking their toll in Niagara. More
than five hundred employees at two Niagara school boards have
become the latest to receive layoff notices. 
<P>
Two hundred, seventy seven staff including 205 teachers will be
laid off in the Lincoln County Board of Education. And at the
Niagara South Board of Education 250 layoff notices have been
sent out. Affecting 218 teaching positions. 
<HR>

<H3>Halton Budget </H3>

<P>
Despite government cutbacks, there will be no increase in taxes
for Halton homeowners. 
<P>
Regional Council approved the 1996 budget today, resulting in
a 0.6 percent decrease in property taxes. Regional Chairman Joyce
Savoline noted this is the third consecutive year that Halton
has approved a budget without a tax boost. 
<HR>

<H3>Kay's - Ti-Cats</H3>

<P>
Has Kay's given up? The courtroom battles between the Hamilton
Tiger Cats, and Kay's Authentic Concessions ... have been put
on hold, temporarily. 
<P>
The Cats changed the locks at Ivor Wynne Stadium yesterday; in
a bid to keep the current concession holder out of the kitchens.
An informal meeting with Mr. Justice David crane yesterday, did
not produce an order to remove the new locks. 
<P>
Kay's president Jon Raffay has now instructed his lawyers not
to proceed with any further legal efforts in regard to the matter.
The reasons behind the request are not clear.
<HR>

<H3>Agostino No Run </H3>

<P>
Hamilton East MPP Dominic Agostino announced today that he will
not run for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party. 
<P>
There had been strong speculation that the Hamilton Liberal would
run. But he says he decided it was not the right time for him.

<H3>Marrow-No Transplant </H3>

<P>
Good evening. Quality of life and life itself hang in the balance
for two southern Ontario residents tonight. We begin with a 4-year-old
Welland boy. 
<P>
Damon Albanese has a rare bone disorder. He's had two bone marrow
transplants that both failed. Because of the failure rate, OHIP
is reluctant to pay for another. Now Damon's parents are appealing
for the public to help save the life of their son. Lauran Sabourin
reports. 
<P>
<I>Damon Albanese lies in a bed at children's hospital getting
another blood transfusion. Treatment to keep this very ill child
alive until he can get another bone marrow transplant. </I>
<P>
<I>Damon suffers from a disorder called osteo petrosis. A rare
bone disease. So rare that Damon's is the first case of osteo
petrosis doctors at Children's Hospital have ever seen. Damon's
only hope is a successful bone marrow transplant. </I>
<P>
<I>Two previous transplants have failed. OHIP is reluctant to
pay for another costly procedure. Doctors in Chicago are willing
to do the transplant. a procedure that will cost Damon's family
160 thousand dollars. </I>
<P>
Anyone wishing to help the family can make a donation to the Damon
Albanese fund at any branch of the bank of nova Scotia. account
number 75787. 
<HR>

<H3>Kidney Man </H3>

<P>
And now David's story. 
<P>
David Boyle of Dundas is one of 187 people waiting for a kidney
transplant in Hamilton alone. March is kidney month and David
is hoping his battle will help raise awareness of kidney disease.
Jamie West reports. 
<P>
<I>That's how 31 year old David Boyle describes the sad ending
to his first kidney transplant, seven years after his mother gave
up one of her own kidney's to save her son. </I>
<P>
<I>The twist's of fate for David have been somewhat cruel, especially
when he and Kim discovered that her kidney was a possible match...
the test results continue to go against them... but despite the
ups and down's they remain positive ...and hope to have a child
in the near future. </I>
<P>
<I>David spends four hours a day Monday Wednesday and Friday hooked
up to a dialysis machine... the only permanent solution to David's
kidney failure, is another transplant, but organs are in short
supply... in Hamilton Jamie West Channel Eleven News.</I> 
<P>
You can make your organ donation wishes known simply by filling
out the back of your driver's license, and if you do it's legally
important that you tell your family what your wishes are. 
<HR>

<H3>Oakville Drown Follow </H3>

<P>
A 19-year-old Brampton man is very much alive and in police custody
in Oakville tonight, following a lengthy police search around
Six Mile Creek. 
<P>
He had been pursued as a suspect in a rash of house break-ins
and ended up in the creek as a result. Police feared he had drowned.
But this afternoon, Rodney Ryan turned himself in at Halton Regional
Police 20 Division headquarters. 
<P>
Charges against him are still pending. Two other suspects have
been charged in connection with the same series of incidents,
a 16-year-old youth and 18 year-old Michael Vanier of Oakville.
They face two counts each of break and enter and breach of probation.

<HR>

<H3>St. Kitts Killing</H3>

<P>
A St. Catharines woman has been charged in Niagara Region's fifth
homicide of the year. 58-year-old Emmannuel Rodrigue of Welland
was found shot in the neck in a Keele Street St. Catharines home
last night. 
<P>
Police say the shooting occurred after a heated argument. 30-year-old
carol Patricia Andrews is facing a charge of second degree murder.

<HR>

<H3>School Arson </H3>

<P>
The Ontario Fire Marshall's Office on the scene today of an overnight
fire at Cardinal Newman High School in east Hamilton. And it looks
like it's arson. 
<P>
A school caretaker heard an alarm shortly before 11 last night,
and spotted two males running across Centennial Parkway. The fire
caused 2-thousand dollars damage. 
<P>
And a few hours earlier ... crews were putting out a small fire
at the construction site of the new Saltfleet High School in Stoney
Creek. It's believed overheated roofing tar may have started that
fire. 
<HR>

<H3>Red Hill Squabble</H3>

<P>
Meetings continue at Queen's Park this hour between Transportation
Minister Al Palladini and Hamilton- Wentworth Chairman Terry Cooke
staff. 
<P>
It's all over the Red Hill Expressway bill. The minister denies
that he is going back on his word. Last Thursday he agreed to
a third party independent review of the funding dispute. 
<P>
The region says it will cost an additional 50-million dollars.
Palladini says those figures are wrong. Earlier today, in the
legislature, Hamilton east liberal MPP Dominic Agostino accused
the minister of short-changing the region. 
<HR>

<H3>403 Limberlost </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, the 403 extension between Ancaster and Brantford is
rolling along. A lawyer representing residents of the Limberlost
subdivision of Ancaster has withdrawn a request for a legal hearing
to fight the expropriation of some of their land. 
<P>
The property is needed to build a critical overpass near shaver
road. There's no official word on why the seventeen residents
have given up the fight, but Brantford MPP Ron Johnson says he's
thrilled that the project can now proceed. 
<HR>

<H3>Burl-Krantz Reaction </H3>

<P>
As expected, Burlington City Council has rejected the notion of
joining the greater Toronto area. Instead, council will tell the
province it wants to stay in a restructured Halton region. At
least one other Halton mayor is willing to investigate that option.

<HR>

<H3>Burl-Mulvale Reaction </H3>

<P>
But another Halton Mayor says it's too soon for her town to turn
its back on the GTA. Oakville Mayor Anne Mulvale first wants to
see how the province responds to the golden report that recommends
reforming the GTA. 
<P>
Mulvale also wants a dollars-and-cents assessment of the costs,
and benefits, of joining the GTA. Municipal Affairs Minister Al
Leach has indicated he hopes to introduce recommendations for
GTA reform by the middle of next month.
<HR>

<H3>HW Budget </H3>

<P>
It's unlikely that Hamilton- Wentworth council can come up with
a zero percent tax increase this year. Politicians agreed to another
round of cuts this afternoon, bringing the increase down below
two percent - or about ten dollars for the average homeowner.

<P>
Plans to hire 25 new police officers would have to be deferred
for another year. A proposed five dollar fee for taking garbage
to the dump was trashed. There are still a few more cuts to be
debated before the final budget is set - probably next week. 
<HR>

<H3>Halton Ed Cuts </H3>

<P>
good news for some teachers tonight. of the nearly 6-hundred who
received layoff notices from the Halton board last month, 325
will keep their jobs. that's because the province's educational
tool kit doesn't allow the board to reduce teacher planning time.
but now, faced with a 16 million dollar shortfall in funding,
the board is looking at a potential mill rate increase of 7-point-6-4
per cent.
<HR>

<H3>Kays - Cats </H3>

<P>
When one partner in a troubled relationship decides to change
the locks, it's a clear signal the relationship is over. And that's
exactly the signal the Hamilton Tiger-Cats intended to send today,
when they changed the locks on all the concession stands at Ivor
Wynne Stadium. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>The Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Kay's Authentic Concessions each
claims the other owes it hundreds of thousands of dollars, and
it's now up to the courts to decide which one is right. But that's
not the only reason the Ticats decided to lock Kay's out of Ivor
Wynne Stadium. </I>
<P>
<I>But Kay's lawyer says he'll be back in court with an application
for injunctive relief before the week is out. With the Tiger-Cats
first pre-season home game less than three months away, the football
team says it will start looking for a new concessionaire, while
the legal spat with Kay's plays out before the courts. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton, Deborah Walker, Channel 11 News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Stelco Contract </H3>

<P>
Members of steelworkers local 1005 will vote a week from today
on an early contract offer that provides no wage increases, but
does offer significant improvements to Stelco's pension and income-sharing
plans. 
<P>
Five-thousand unionized employees at Hamilton's Hilton Works are
eligible to vote on the six-year contract. If accepted, pension
benefits would increase by twenty-five per cent, effective august
first of this year. Additional increases over the life of the
contract would raise pension income forty-one per cent by the
year 2001. 
<P>
The contract offer also provides improvements to benefits and
vacation scheduling, and would eliminate all combo jobs within
a year of ratification. The union executive unanimously recommends
acceptance of the contract. 
<HR>

<H3>Niagara Accidents </H3>

<P>
Bad weather forced provincial police to close the Fort Erie bound
Queen Elizabeth Way for about an hour this morning. In the most
serious accident near Niagara Falls, two people were hurt. 
<P>
Ministry of Transportation employees, responsible for keeping
the highways clear, are on strike.

<H3>Highway Six Latest</H3>

<P>
Good evening. 
<P>
It's been a weekend of highway carnage. Accidents on Ontario roadways
have claimed fourteen lives since Friday night. 
<P>
The largest single crash occurred on early Saturday morning, on
highway six north near the village of Millgrove. Annette Hamm
tells us that fatal crash has fueled yet another look at safety
on highway six. 
<P>
<I>This head on crash early Saturday morning killed 23 year old
Frank Nicolazzo of Ancaster and four Guelph residents. It's one
of the worst single crashes on a highway infamous for accidents.
</I>
<P>
<I>Chris Rose knows the dangers of six ... he lives on one side
of the highway and works on the other. </I>
<P>
<I>Getting drivers to slow down is one way of preventing crashes,
but the trauma prevention council is also calling for engineering
changes. one change being pushed for by residents along the highway
is a stoplight near the village of Millgrove. A stoplight, they
say, would leave a gap in traffic flow allowing drivers to turn
left on or off the highway. </I>
<P>
<I>It is hoped with this latest fatal crash on highway six, the
ministry of transportation will seriously consider putting the
stoplight in. </I>
<P>
<I>Near Flamborough, Annette Hamm, Channel 11 News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Red Hill Options </H3>

<P>
And another controversial highway in the news tonight but this
one isn't even built yet. 
<P>
Hamilton- Wentworth's Chairman hopes to resolve a funding feud
with the province, when he meets with transportation minister
Al Palladini tomorrow to discuss the Red Hill Creek Expressway.

<P>
The province and the region are at odds over the total bill for
the freeway, and over who should pay for what. And as Deborah
walker reports, some councilors are miffed with Palladini's suggestion
the region has inflated its cost projections. 
<P>
<I>Three years ago this month, Conservative leader Mike Harris
met with Hamilton- Wentworth's Citizens' Expressway Committee,
and made a promise. But once elected, the Harris government allocated
100-million dollars to the Red Hill Creek Expressway, only half
of what Hamilton- Wentworth would have received under the original
provincial funding agreement. And the Tories want the region to
pay the cost of linking the expressway to the QEW at the Centennial
Parkway interchange. </I>
<P>
<I>Hamilton- Wentworth's Chairman believes Transportation Minister
Al Palladini will commit more money to the expressway, if an independent
review confirms the region's cost estimates. </I>
<P>
<I>Whether or not the province pays up, Hamilton- Wentworth region
will consider soliciting private bids to build the expressway,
in order to speed up construction of the north-south leg of the
freeway. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton, Deborah walker, Channel Eleven News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Teacher Grievance </H3>

<P>
The union representing Hamilton public high school teachers has
launched a labour grievance over layoff notices recently sent
out by the school board. 
<P>
More than 200 high school teachers were pink slip recipients...
but OSSTF District 8 President Doug Robb, says the step-by-step
collective agreement process was not followed. 
<H3>Teacher Tag </H3>

<P>
Below is an example of a <I><B>Trimark</B></I><B>
Regular Investment <I>Plan.</I></B> The purchaser of the plan
invested $100 a month beginning at <B>Trimark Fund</B>'s inception,
September 1, 1981.<BR>

<P>
The <B>Trimark Fund</B> plan value reflects the deduction
of a 5% commission rate as well as changes in unit value and assumes
income and capital gains distributions are reinvested. It does
not take into account administrative fees, payable by unitholders,
which would have reduced returns.<BR>

<P>
For comparative purposes, we have shown the same
schedule of deposits invested at a 10% annual compounded total
rate of return with no fees deducted.<BR>

<P>
Latest 1-year, 3-year, 5-year and 10-year historical
annual compounded total rates of return for <B>Trimark Fund</B>
to December 31, 1995 were 16.7%, 20.8%, 23.9% and 15.0% respectively.
Since its inception, investors in <B>Trimark Fund</B> earned 18.3%.
While all results are based on the past performance of the fund,
these are not necessarily indicative of future results. Your unit
value and investment returns will fluctuate.<BR>

<P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>An Introduction to Mackenzie</H1>
<P>
At Mackenzie, we're committed to building financial independence
for investors in our Industrial, Ivy and Universal Fund groups.
For more than 25 years, we've assisted investors to achieve both
specific financial goals and the sense of financial well-being
which comes from knowing that their savings are being professionally
managed to grow and earn income.
<P>
Our approach is based on several fundamental investment principles:
<UL>
<LI>Investors should be able to take advantage of the benefits
of diversification by choosing from a wide range of mutual fund
options based an types of assets held, geographic scope and management
style.
<LI>Only proven professionals with an outstanding record of performance
may direct fund portfolios.
<LI>Fund managers and their styles should remain consistent through
the years. Those responsible fop international funds should be
located close to their investments. 
<LI>Independent, knowledgeable financial planning advice is essential
to meeting personal objectives.
<LI>True professional management must include a dedicated, ongoing
investor service and information program. 
<LI>Mutual funds should be interchangeable at the option of the
investor. 
</UL>

<P>
By sticking with the principles that have guided us over the past
27-years and with investment approaches that have generated superior
long-term performance we plan to continue to be investment managers
of choice for Canadians into the next century and beyond.<BR>

<P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A Proven Investment Strategy</H1>
<P>
In the world of professional money management, there
are many different styles. And styles can change. They can be
popular one day and not the next. So it's reassuring to many investors
that Mackenzie has just one basic strategy and two complimentary
approaches, none of which will ever go out of fashion.<BR>
<P>
For The Industrial Group of Funds, Mackenzie managers
follow what can best be described as a &quot;top-down&quot; stock
selection approach. That is, they review the short and long-term
outlook for the Canadian economy and, based on this analysis,
choose specific market sectors that offer the promise of better
performance. From there, individual securities are selected, based
on detailed research and the likelihood that the market will ultimately
value them more highly. The same process is taken by the managers
of Universal Canadian Equity Fund and Universal Canadian Resource
Fund.<BR>
<P>
For the Ivy Funds, Mackenzie managers take a &quot;bottom-up&quot;
approach, starting with an in-depth, fundamental analysis of promising
companies. When value is identified, the Ivy managers assess industry-specific
and economic considerations before investing. <BR>
<P>
Across the board, Mackenzie managers take an  independent
view of the world and constantly question conventional wisdom.
 They identify and buy undervalued securities that represent good
value and sell those that may be over-priced and facing decline.
 And they share the full resources of Mackenzie, including research,
ideas and access to our international investment advisors.  Overall,
the long-term objective for every one of our equity portfolios
is the same: to maximize total return and protect invested capital.
 Which approach is right for you?  Past performance indicates
that you are in good hands with either, or both, over the long
term.<BR>
<P>
But by investing in each of these complimentary fund
families, you build in additional diversification and the potential
for greater growth.

<TITLE>Planning Circle Financial Group: Mackenzie: Diversification: The Importance of Choice</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY BACKGROUND="images/pcfgbkgd.jpg">

<A HREF="../pcfg/"><IMG SRC="images/pcfgsm.gif" ALT="Return to the Planning Circle Financial Group Home Page" WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=71 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>

<P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Diversification:</H1>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Importance of Choice</H1>
<P>
In today's complex economic
environment, it's only natural for investors to be cautious. 
But to build a successful investment portfolio, even the most
cautious investor must realize that there is no such thing as
a risk-free investment ... that potential returns frequently increase
with volatility ... and that the most important challenge is to
build a diversified investment portfolio that offers the right
balance between risk and reward.
<P>
As professional money managers,
we recognize that each investor has different risk and return
preferences.  To satisfy these preferences, our goal is to offer
the broadest range of mutual fund choices in Canada.  By investing
in a portfolio of different Mackenzie-managed funds, investors
can strike a balance that best suits their own investment goals.
<P>
We offer a full range of investment
choices. Our equity funds typically produce better long-term returns
than income or balanced funds - although, inevitably, greater
risk is assumed over the short term.
<P>
For many Canadians, Mackenzie's
domestic equity funds represent the ideal balance between risk
and reward.  They are prepared to experience occasional volatility
in short-term performance - including lower or even negative returns.
 In exchange, the longer term rewards can be substantial, as the
performance record of our equity funds indicates.
<P>
To decide which Mackenzie
fund - or funds - are right for you, and to establish your investment
objectives and risk tolerance level, consult an investment fund
dealer or stockbroker.  These independent professionals can help
you to diversity your portfolio ... and make the most of these
important fund choices.<BR>

<TITLE>Planning Circle Financial Group: Mackenzie GIC's</TITLE>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Mackenzie GIC's</H1>


<P>
Once upon a time sailors only felt safe for as long as they could
keep the shore-line in sight. Likewise, many RRSP investors cling
to the sense of security offered by guaranteed investment certificates,
or GIC's. The lure of knowing what they're going to get when a
GIC matures may seem irresistible. However, the unseen danger
for timid RRSP investors is that their quest for the &quot;riskless
return&quot; can prevent them from ever crossing over to the promised
land of financial independence at retirement.

<P>
There are three key points to consider when comparing GIC's against
a portfolio of equity or bond mutual funds.

<P>
The first is <B>investment risk</B>. GIC's have more risk than
meets the eye. When RRSP investors purchase a 5-year GIC they
are essentially betting that interest rates <B>will not change</B>
over the five years. Why? Clearly, if rates go up an investor
would have done better by buying a shorter-term GIC, or even a
money-market fund, and then trading it in for a GIC when rates
rose. If rates fell, instead of patting themselves on the back
a GIC investor might wish to consider that by owning a bond fund
their RRSP would have gone up in value as interest rates fell.
In either case, they're worse off owning the GIC. 

<P>
Second, mutual fund portfolios can offer a <B>superior long-term
track record of returns</B>. Evidence for this conclusion has
been compiled according to a thorough analysis by Garmaise Investment
Technologies. They have measured the performance returns of a
hypothetical GIC investor, starting in May of 1977, buying a 5-year
GIC every month, and regularly rolling it over into a new GIC
at the end of its term.

<P>
The accompanying chart displays the cumulative and annualized
rates of return.

<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="images/star2.jpg">
</CENTER>

<P>
For purposes of comparison, Garmaise has constructed a hypothetical
RRSP mutual fund portfolio and projected its performance over
the same time period.  This typical RRSP portfolio was invested
40% in Canadian stock, 40% in Canadian bonds, 12% in U.S. stocks,
and 8% in international stocks.  To reduce the possibility of
skewing the results, Garmaise chose the returns of the median
fund (the median is the point at which half of the fund returns
were higher and half were lower than the stated figure) in each
category, and thus calculated these returns <B>after</B> accounting
for the management fees.<BR>

<P>
As you can see, the mutual fund RRSP portfolio significantly outperformed
the GIC portfolio over the long-term.  One-year returns exceeded
those for the GIC portfolio two-thirds of the time, while five-year
returns for the fund portfolio beat the GIC portfolio three-quarters
of the time.  Over ten year periods, the fund portfolio outperformed
GIC's a remarkable 97% of the time.
<P>
The lesson is unmistakable-being a patient diversified mutual
fund investor pays!  The longer you remain invested the more confident
you can be that your performance returns will surpass those available
on GIC's.  
<P>
A third key point if that many mutual fund portfolios provide
<B>international diversification</B>, effectively <B>decreasing
the risk of holding just one currency</B>.  A GIC portfolio is
subject to the ongoing risk that the value of the Canadian dollar
may depreciate against foreign currencies.  If you expect to be
a consumer of foreign goods in ten or twenty years time when you
retire, your cumulative currency risk can quickly mount up.
<P>
GIC's do have a place in the spectrum of investment options. 
They provide a genuine service for investors confronted by short
time horizons, or those having an exceptionally low threshold
for risk.  But, there are three persuasive reasons to pause before
&quot;playing it safe&quot; by purchasing a GIC for your RRSP
this winter.
<UL>
<LI>GIC's are not riskless.  If interest rates fluctuate during
the period you own the GIC, alternative investments can offer
better rates of return with acceptable increases in risk
<LI>Most diversified mutual fund portfolios have significantly
out-performed GIC's over the long run-and long term growth of
capital will prove crucial if your RRSP is to provide sufficient
retirement income
<LI>Canadian $ GIC's do not offer any international diversification
compared to mutual fund portfolios; nor can they offset the long-term
risk of holding just one currency
</UL>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>A Stellar RRSP Performance:</H2>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Star Registered Conservative Income &amp; Growth Portfolio</H2>

<P>
According to Gordon Garmaise investing is more than just an art-it
is an art that can be measurably improved by science.  Since 1977,
in conjunction with major Canadian trust companies and Wilshire
Associates of Los Angeles, Garmaise Investment Technologies has
measured the performance of over 1,000 Canadian pension portfolios
worth over $60 billion.
<P>
Given his almost two decades of experience gathering and analyzing
historical portfolio performance data, it's only natural that
certain observations would have been honed to a razor's sharpness.
<P>
To begin, it's proven very difficult to find portfolio managers
who are consistently able to outperform the market.  The market
is remarkable for its capacity to elude even the most sophisticated
efforts to time it in advance.
<P>
Second, recent research has indicated that approximately 90 per
cent of any individual's investment return will be determined
by their long-term strategic asset allocation.  In plain language,
this means it is important to select the best combination among
various investment assets.  There are four major asset classes:
equities, fixed income, cash, and precious metals.
<P>
Mackenzie secured the talents of Garmaise Investment Technologies
to offer Canadian investors a financial product-the STAR Strategic
Asset Allocation Service-that concentrates on more efficiently
diversifying their mutual fund portfolios in light of how markets
are actually behaving.  The idea is to minimize unnecessary investment
risk.  By setting the focus on long-term performance, once can
largely avoid the inevitable disappointments that accompany market
timing.
<P>
<I><B>Strategic Asset Allocation</B></I>
<P>
The process begins with a simple, yet comprehensive questionaire,
that allows us to discover a more accurate profile of your tolerance
for risk.  This accomplished, risk is controlled by efficiently
diversifying your holdings in a portfolio of up to 7 mutual funds.
 These are scientifically combined according to asset class, geographic
region, how all 7 fund correlate with one another over time, and
the investment style of each fund manager.
<P>
The value of this investment approach is quickly becoming less
academic, and more a matter of record.
<P>
The chart below illustrates what even the most rick-adverse RRSP
investor would have been able to achieve since January of 1995,
using the strategic asset allocation approach of STAR, in the
Registered Conservative Income &amp; Growth portfolio.  This portfolio
emphasizes both predictable income flow and protection of capital.
 It is designed for investors with moderate tolerance for volatility
in year-to-year returns.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="images/star1.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>
The heavy line traces how STAR smoothed out the more volatile
paths of the 7 underlying Mackenzie funds over the course of the
past year.  More importantly, the conservative portfolio's first
year demonstrates that by learning to live more in harmony with
the market's own rhythms you can substantially lessen risk without
compromising returns beyond repair.  While performance will certainly
vary in the future, the rather generous return for those invested
in this portfolio throughout the year was 15.8%.
<P>
For investors who are comparison shopping, these results are bound
to be eye-opening.  If you want more information about STAR, please
talk to your financial advisor.  By putting together the most
modern thinking with leading-edge technology, they can help you
to improve the performance of your RRSP investment.

<b>Local Governance</b><p>
A provincial committee is recommending that the Harris government do away with the five regions in the greater Toronto area and replace them with a super city structure.<br>   Bob Ireland has the story from queens park.
<i><br>  The chair of the "who does what" panel, David Crombie, is suggesting that regional governments in the GTA be scrapped, and that city's in Halton such as Burlington and Oakville, and Mississauga and Brampton in Peel, and the Durham Region east of Toronto, be merged with metro Toronto into a greater Toronto services board. Membership in the new government structure would be based on population..the new supercity would be responsible for regional roads, waste management, sewer and water, police board co-ordination, as well as infastructure and social planning. But it would have no direct taxing authority. <br> Crombie says regardless of what amalgamations take place, communities will still be able to retain their local identities. <br>  The report also gives options for amalgamation of Toronto and its five metro cities. It suggests either one mega city, or have Toronto absorb the cities of York and East York, leaving the other larger metro partners alone. Toronto mayor Barbara Hall is against the one mega city concept. <br>  But Anne Golden, the original author of the GTA government concept says amalgamation is the wave of the future. </i>
<hr>
<b>Doctors Dispute</b><p>
The next few days are expected to be critical in the provincial doctors' dispute.<br>   Negotiators for the Ontario Medical Association and the province are talking today and tomorrow in Toronto.<br>   The exact location isn't being disclosed.<br>   OMA president Dr. Gerry Rowland says they hope to have something worked out this weekend.
<hr>
<b>CAI Negotiations</b><p>
It looks like an agreement might be close on the restructuring plan for Canadian Airlines International.<br>   Transport minister David Anderson says Canadian and holdout union leader Buzz Hargrove have resolved most of their difficulties.<br>   In Toronto, Hargrove also notes some progress on the issues but says there's still no deal yet.
<hr>
<b>Baby Death</b><p>
Provincial police are investigating the discovery of the body of a male infant, found on a side road in Delhi Township.<br>   A post mortem is being performed to determined the cause of death.<br>   Police say they're attempting to gather information on the baby and try to locate the mother.<br>   They're asking anyone with any information in the case to get in touch with them.
<hr>
<b>Bernardo </b><p>
Paul Bernardo is nursing a black eye and a cut cheek.<br>   The convicted sex-killer was punched in the face today by another inmate at Kingston Penitentiary.<br>   He was being escorted to his cell after taking a shower when the attack occurred.<br>   Bernardo is serving life for abducting, raping and killing southern Ontario teenagers Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French.
<hr>
<b>Tobacco Rush </b><p>
Health minister David Dingwall is defending his anti-smoking legislation, saying tobacco company money is not such a big factor in supporting the arts.<br>   He's told a committee studying the legislation that the amount of money the industry gives to the arts has been overblown.<br>   His legislation would put strict limits on tobacco company sponsorship of sports and arts events.
<hr>
<b>Best Cars</b><p>
Looking for the perfect gift for that special someone this Christmas...<br>  how about a car.<br>  As Dwight Ryan reports, ...a German sports coupe has been named the best car of the year by a group of auto industry reporters.<br>  The one catch ... its costly. <br>  
<i><br>  Foreign cars sales are again on the rise. And the best of the bunch is the BMW M3.  That's according to the Automotive Journalists Association of Canada.<br>  For four days, the association members put 112 vehicles through their paces looking at them from every angle to determine the best...  <br>  The Ford Motor Company came up with the most winners coming in first in four categories.<br>  The Escort topped both the economy car and station wagon sections.  As well the Ford F150 was the best pickup, and the new expedition topped the enormously popular sport utility vehicle category.<br>  Other favourites of the journalists included the new Cadillac Catera as the best luxury car, the Mercedes Benz E420 in the prestige group. Hyundai's new Tiburon topped the sports coupe and convertible section..and the just introduced Chevrolet Venture was the best minivan.<br>  The awards were presented in Toronto. <br>  A suitably equipped BMW M3 sells for about 62 thousand dollars.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Chanticleer</b><p>
Chanticleer, the only full-time classical vocal ensemble in North America, has developed a remarkable reputation for its interpretation of vocal literature, from long-ago music to jazz and gospel.<br>  Alex Reynolds says this "orchestra of voices" will celebrate Christmas at the Ford Centre in North York tonight.
<i> <br>  The group takes it name from "Chanticleer," the rooster in Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales," although the word comes from a medieval French story ....meaning to sing clearly. <br>  The twelve men celebrated for a seamless sound ranging from bass to countertenor voices, visit the North York Recital Hall tonight.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Hanukkah </b><p>
This year, the tradition of Hanukkah is being discoveredby some Jewish immigrants.<br>  For them, the holiday means a time to celebrate their long-lost heritage.. and their new-found freedom.<br>

<b>Specialists Protest</b><p>
The deadline looms in less than 24 hours.<br>   But the Ontario Medical Association says it's confident of a settlement in the doctors dispute with the province.<br>   A coalition of medical specialists is calling for a province-wide closure of all their members' offices, beginning next Friday.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Canadian - CAW</b><p>
CAW chief Buzz Hargove still hopes there can be a negotiated settlement to his union's dispute with Canadian Airlines.<br>  The federal government has ordered CAW members to vote on a restructuring plan that would result in another pay cut.<br>  The union is opposed to the vote but says it won't take it to court.<br>    The unprecedented move by the feds, to get the union members to vote, has many in the Canadian labour movement uneasy.<br>  Dwight Ryan has the story. <br>  
<i><br>  Canadian Airlines workers who are members of the Canadian Auto Workers union are clearly upset at their leader, Buzz Hargrove.<br>  Hargrove has steadfastly refused to let his members vote on a deal that would again see workers taking a pay cut.  But the workers want to vote.<br>  He says the government must put more money into the pot to save the airline and the jobs ...and that the airline industry must again be regulated..   <br>   But, in an unprecedented move, the federal government says the workers will vote, and soon.  <br>    Wayne Marston heads up the Hamilton and District Labour Council.   <br>    CAW representatives are still meeting with airline officials in an attempt to come up with a negotiated settlement.<br>  In another news conference a short time ago, Buzz Hargrove said no settlement to the issue is imminent.<br>  But, time is running out.  <br>    </i>
<hr>
<b>Toronto Supercity</b><p>
Tomorrow the government's "who does what" panel will announce its plans for re-structuring metro Toronto and its four outlying regions.<br>   A leaked document says one recommendation will be to  get rid of metro and the regions and have a GTA wide commission made up of metro mayors and representation from major cities in Halton, Peel and Durham regions.<br>  Municipal affairs minister Al Leach says he favors folding Toronto and its five metro cities into one super city.
<hr>
<b>QP Thurs.</b><p>
It looks like the Canadian-led military aid mission to central Africa is off.<br>   Defence minister Doug Young also says it's unlikely any airdrops are going to be required.<br>   Young says a large, new movement of up to 400-thousand Rwandan refugees returning home from Zaire and Tanzania all but eliminates the need for a military mission.<br>   And he adds history will smile on Canada for its role in the crisis.
<hr>
<b>Bank Protest</b><p>
On a day when more banks announced record profits, two groups spoke up, saying there needs to be more oversight of banks.<br>  The Council for Canadians staged a demonstration outside the Royal Bank.<br>  They were protesting what they consider excess bank profits.<br>  Protesters say in a world of unemployment and poverty, profits like these shouldn't be allowed.
<hr>
<b>Shuttle a Day</b><p>
The crew of the Shuttle Columbia.. will get yet another day in space.. after all.<br>  Cloudy weather over Florida's Cape Canaveral.. put this morning's scheduled landing on hold.<br>   The original landing had been set for Friday, but NASA moved it up a day.. because of a naviational system problem.. and the threat of bad weather at Kennedy Space Center.        <br>   NASA considered having Columbia land.. at Edwards Air Force Base in California, but that was scratched as well.<br>   The delay will make Columbia's 17 day mission.. the second longest shuttle flight ever.

<b>Canadian Extra</b><p>
The Canadian Auto Workers Union plans to go to court to challenge a federal order to hold a vote on the restructuring plan for Canadian Airlines.<br>   CAW president Buzz Hargrove says the union is seeking legal advice on the matter.<br>     In the house of commons earlier today, labor minister Alfonso Gagliano moved to force a vote by Hargrove's union on the restructuring plan.<br>   Gagliano says 16-thousand jobs are at stake.<br>   And he says he expects the vote to be held within days.
<hr>
<b>Pricey Consultants</b><p>
Provincial politicians will be working overtime this winter.<br>   Premier Mike Harris has called a "special session" of the Ontario legislature to deal with government restructuring.<br>  Part of that restructuring will include hiring outside consultants at up to 26-hundred dollars a day, to figure out how to get rid of 13 thousand civil servants.<br> 
<hr>
<b>Harris - 407</b><p>
The new highway 4-0-7 may be the most expensive toll road in North America.<br>   Rush-hour commuters could pay as much as 22-hundred dollars a year if they were to drive the entire length of the expressway daily.<br>  The Ontario Trucking Association says the toll road will be too costly for truckers to use.<br>   But premier Mike Harris says because it is convenient, he expects the highway will attract commercial traffic.            <br>  The 36 kilometre section of the tollway, connecting Highway 410 in Brampton to Highway 404 in Markham, is expected to be open by March 31st.

Opposition parties and students in Yugoslavia staged their biggest protest yet today.<br>   It's the 17-th day of protests against president Slobodan Milosevic, and his annulment of opposition victories in local elections.<br>  And now some 90 judges have added their voices to the protest... saying the election issue should be re-examined.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Paris Bomb</b><p>
French police say a Canadian woman was one of the two people killed in a Paris train bombing yesterday.<br>   Another Canadian -- a man -- was among the more than 80 people injured in the attack.<br>   The woman's name is not known.<br>   But the Canadian man has been identified as 30-year-old Frank Stonebanks, who works for a Montreal firm and was recently transferred to Paris.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Jane Eyre </b><p>
A novel ....three movies ....and now a stage musical.<br>  The Royal Alexandra Theatre was the scene last night of the world premiere of Charlotte Bronte's classic "Jane Eyre".<br>  The story, set-to-song had the audience cheering, but as Alex Reynolds reports, critics wonder if the public will embrace this century old love story.
<i> <br>  "Jane Eyre" has become a woman of our time.<br>  With fine tuning by 20th century crafts people, the heroine of the 19th century novel now sings.<br>  The overlong first act approximates three-quarters of Bronte's narrative.... the show is heavy with detail.... Jane's life between her teens and adulthood is glossed over.<br>  Excising would wrap it up neatly, leading into the post intermission romance between Jane and Edward Rochester.<br>  The dark brooding Thornfield Hall on the Yorkshire Moors matches that of the owner's manner.... harboring a sinister secret, which eventually leads to tragic consequences.<br>  Chris Parry's lighting design superbly captures the dark mood of John Napier's massive set.<br>  Comparisons will be made to "Les Miz."<br>  For the most part, there's a sung-through narrative.....and here Paul Gordon's songs underline the drama, as well as romance....but, aside from "Secret Soul," a melodious ode to Jane's inner feelings....lack the soaring feeling the story calls for.<br>  It's a serious first time theatre outing for Gordon who's songs have been recorded by many pop stars.<br>  Director John Caird, who also adapted the book to the stage, and is affiliated with the Royal Shakespeare Company has created a massive theatre piece that imposes challenges to the audience.<br>  There are no special effects to astonish.... just a classic story.  It's like reading the novel but with visuals added.<br>  It's a $6 million risk for producer David Mirvish...spit and polish, nip and tuck would do wonders.<br>  Oh! Did I mention Marla Schaffel and Anthony Crivello?<br>  She's appropriately virginal, he dark, brooding and vulnerable ...they're a good team.<br>  The show packs the emotional wallop of the book....with music added.<br>  There are critics who'll say the story should have stayed on the book shelf.... with doctoring the musical has a chance.<br>  </i>

</ul>
<hr>
<b>Liberals - Hamilton</b><p>
Ontario Liberals are choosing a new leader.<br>  The leadership convention is now under way at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto.<br>  The front-runner is considered by many too left-wing to lead the party.
<hr>
<b>Ont. Liberals</b><p>
The biggest task facing Liberal delegates at this weekend's convention is to pick a leader who will ulimately bring the party to power in the next provincial election.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Tobacco Smuggling</b><p>
Taxes on tobacco went up today, several years after having been cut in order to stop a rampant smuggling problem in central Canada and the maritimes.<br>  Liberal minister Don Boudria, whose eastern Ontario riding includes parts of the St. Lawrence River Valley where cigarette smuggling flourished, doesn't expect the problem to surface again.
<hr>
<b>Drummond on Hold</b><p>
The trial of a woman accused of shooting her fetus is on hold for three weeks.<br>  An Ontario judge has reserved judgment.<br>  Both sides have made their opening arguments on the Brenda Drummond case.<br>  The defence says Drummond can't be charged with attempted murder because she did not shoot a human being.<br>  Drummond's lawyers say because the fetus was not yet legally a human being, the issue is really about abortion.
<hr>
<b>Salvi Dead</b><p>
The man convicted of murdering two people during a shooting rampage at two abortion clinics in the Boston area has died.<br>   A corrections department spokesman says John Salvi was found dead in his prison cell.<br>   Salvi's mother says he killed himself.
<hr>
<b>Zaire Extra </b><p>
Canada refuses to back away from a plan to air drop food to refugees in Zaire.<br>  The Zairian government, aid workers, and even the Canadian commander of the aid effort are concerned about the proposed air drop.<br>   But in Ottawa foreign affairs minister Lloyd Axworthy says Canada has the support of as many as 20 countries to set up a military headquarters in Entebbe, Uganda.
<hr>
<b>Wang Dan</b><p>
Prime minister Chretien has made no secret of his desire to increse trade with China.<br>  Earlier this week, the PM was in Shanghai signing the final contract to sell China Canadian nuclear reactors.<br>  Today, a group of human rights activists demanded Chretien do more to support human rights in China.<br>  In particular, they asked him to seek the release of Chinese dissident Wang Dan, one of the student leaders of the 1989 Tienanmen Square protest.

<hr>
<b>Eves Statement</b><p>
Finance minister Ernie Eves, deliveried a rosy economic picture for Ontario today. But opposition critics called the ministers statement window dressing. 
<hr>
<b>Drummond - Crown</b><p>
The Brenda Drummond case may not re-open the abortion deabate after all.<br>  It was thought the case of the woman charged with shooting her fetus with a pellet gun would become a new battleground over the rights of the fetus.<br>  But today the crown attorney agreed with Drummond's lawyer in saying that a fetus is not considered a person, but it is still protected under the criminal code.<br>  The crown says that because the fetus survived the gun shot and was born alive, the mother can be charged with attempted murder.
<hr>
<b>Mattison Paroled</b><p>
 Another case from the courts is causing some negative reaction from women's groups; disturbed that a wife-killer, and ex-cop, has been paroled after serving only three years of a ten year sentence. Scot Urquhart has more:
<i><br>  It was one of the most gruesome slayings in recent memory. Nicole Mattison ... 52 years old, shot and killed by a police revolver, in this Fonthill residence ... by her husband David; a 25 year veteran of the Metro Toronto Police force. Her body was then cut into pieces and scattered in various locations ... including Lake Ontario ... the investigation caused an extensive search by police divers, that stretched over a period of months.... and resulted in a conviction against David Mattison, not for murder ... but for manslaughter. He was sentenced to ten years in prison; and this week, after serving three years ... he was released on day parole. Did Mattison get a soft ride in the justice system because he was a cop? Jill Rumble heads up a working group of some 30 different organizations committed to ending violence against women. She says, Mattison may have got preferrential treatment ... but it had nothing to do with his police background: <br>  The irony in this ... Mattison's release comes at the end of wife assault prevention month. <br>  Rumble says the Mattison case will be discussed by her working group ... and letters of protest to the federal justice minister could follow. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Cigarette Tax</b><p>
Taxes on cigarettes are going up -- but only in the four provinces that lowered their provincial tobacco taxes in 1994.<br>   The federal government will hit smokers in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick with a 70-cent per carton hike.<br>   At the same time, those provinces will match the tax increase.<br>   Finance minister Paul Martin has also extended a surtax on tobacco manufacturers for three years, a measure he says will raise 65-million dollars a year.           <br>     The tax increases take effect at midnight local times.
<hr>
<b>Olsen Videos</b><p>
Videos made by notorious killer Clifford Olsen have victim's rights groups concerned.<br>  An Ottawa group says the videos, which detail Olsen's killings, puts the ownership of the tapes in question.<br>  They say Olsen has duped prison authorities into giving up the videos.<br>  But solicitor general Herb Grey says there is no danger of the tapes falling into the wrong hands.
<hr>
<b>Zaire</b><p>
Canada will spearhead a plan to airdrop humanitarian aid to Rwandan refugees.<br>  Foreign affairs minister Lloyd Axworthy says 15 countries have pledged their support for a scaled down relief operation.<br>  Although the movement of refugees several weeks ago had thrown the operation into question, Axworthy says Canada's help is still needed.
<hr>
<b>Macey's Parade</b><p>
Today is Thanksgiving south of the border and many Americans spent the day feasting on turkey and spending time with loved ones.<br>   And for many, Thanksgiving wouldn't be complete without the mother of all parades... the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York.<br>  Hundreds of thousands of people braved the cold to get an up-close look at the procession.<br>  An estimated 45-million others watched it on TV.<br>   The 70-th edition of the parade featured a number of celebrities, more than 500 clowns, 13 marching bands, 17 floats and 18 huge helium balloons.
<hr>
<b>Holiday Windows</b><p>
Anyone who's visited New York City during the holiday season has probably seen the elaborate displays at some of the major retailers...<br>  Some are more elaborate than others..<br>   Well known chains spend up to half a million dollars on their window displays ..but are they worth the cost?<br>

<hr>
<b>Drunk Suspensions</b><p>
The Harris government is getting tough with drunk drivers.<br>   Starting Friday, anyone caught drinking and driving in Ontario, will automatically lose their licences for 90 days.<br>  
<hr>
<b>No Mini Budget</b><p>
The province has put off its announcement of another three-billion dollars in spending cuts.<br>   Finance minister Ernie Eves says instead, a statement will be issued tomorrow and will focus on providing a snapshot of the province's current finances.<br>  The Tories have already outlined about five-billion dollars in cuts.<br>  But they say they don't have all the information needed to make the new cuts.<br>  Opposition parties think otherwise.
<hr>
<b>Drummond</b><p>
Opening arguments have begun in what could be a ground-breaking attempted murder trial near Ottawa.<br>   The lawyer for a Carleton Place woman says his client was trying to kill herself or provoke a miscarriage when she fired a pellet shot at her unborn child in her womb.<br>   Lawrence Greenspon says neither act is a crime.<br>   Brenda Drummond is charged with the attempted murder of her son, who was born two days after the shooting with a pellet lodged in his head.
<hr>
<b>Latimer Appeal</b><p>
Meanwhile, a Saskatchewan man's appeal to be re-tried for the murder of his disabled daughter is in limbo.<br>  The Supreme Court decided today to reserve judgement in the case of Saskatchewan farmer Robert Latimer, meaning it may be months before a decision is made.<br>  Latimer was convicted of murdering his disabled daughter two years ago.<br>  In a taped confession, Latimer said he killed his daughter to end her pain.<br>  The defence is arguing that Latimer's confession was obtained illegally.
<hr>
<b>School Bus Fatal</b><p>
One person is dead after a school bus collided with a car this morning in the Port Perry area, north of Oshawa.<br>   Provincial police say the male driver of the car is dead.<br>   There were no serious injuries on board the school bus, which was loaded with high school students.<br>   It happened around 9 a-m on highway 7a between Port Perry and Blackstock.<br>   The name of the victim has not been released.
<hr>
<b>Air Bag Dead</b><p>
It was just a minor fender-bender -- but it resulted in the death of a one-year-old girl who was decapitated by an air bag.<br>   Police in Boise, Idaho, say the accident in a parking lot triggered the passenger-side air bag in the car being driven by the girl's mother.<br>   Air bags have been blamed in the deaths of more than 30 American children in low-speed crashes.
<hr>
<b>Gun Law</b><p>
Ottawa has tabled its new gun registry which governs the way firearms are stored and transported.<br>  Federal justice minister Allan Rock says the new registration system will curb firearm trafficking and theft and make it easier for the police to track stolen guns.<br>  Ian Dovey reports.                
<I><br>  Ottawa says buying a firearm will under the proposed regulations be straightforward and practical.<br>  The new process will be much like a credit card purchase.<br>  The swipe of a license and registration card will verify that the buyer is authroized to buy the gun and that the store is authorized to sell it. <br>    Beginning in 1998 everyone who owns a gun will have to have a license.<br>  The five year license will range from 10 to 80 dollars depending on the calibre of the weapon.<br>  Regarding the storage of weapons...<br>  Non restricted firearms will have to be stored unloaded, locked or deactivated in a separate location from the ammunition.<br>  Restricted or prohibited weapons must be stored in the same fashion but with a trigger lock in a locked case or cabinet.<br>  Rock says the existing permit to transport firearms will replaced with simpler rules. <br>    Rock says the regualtions will apply to aboriginal peoples as well, but enforced with respect for the aboriginal way of life.<br>  The gun registry has been widely opposed in rural areas.<br>  Ontario along with Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and the territories say they will not enforce the registry.<br>  Alberta is challenging the regulations in court.<br>  </I>
<hr>
<b>Boris Pasternak</b><p>
For many years, Boris Pasternak...the author of Doctor Zhivago, maintained a secret love life ...worthy of ...well, a Russian novel.<br>  And now, you can read all about it.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Cancer Connection</b><p>
There's a new service up and running now across Ontario to help cancer patients deal with their disease and its treatment.<br>  Through "Cancer Connection", patients or their caregivers are matched up anonymously with a cancer survivor who's been through a similiar experience.<br>  Their contact is by phone, with the Canadian Cancer Society picking up the tab for any long distance charges.  
<br>  If you have cancer and want to hear from someone who shares your experience, or if you're a cancer survivor who'd like to help, you can call "Cancer Connection" toll free at 1-800-263-6750.

<b>Docs Update</b><p>
As of next Monday, it could be hard trying to get an after-hours appointment with a family doctor in Ontario.<br>  That's the day thousands of doctors in the province are being asked by the Coalition of Family Physicians to stop booking evening and weekend appointments.<br>  The move means more after-hours clinics will likely close their doors.<br>  And it's the latest escalation in the dispute between doctors and the province over cutbacks to the health-care system.<br>   
<hr>
<b>Witmer WCB</b><p>
Benefits to injured workers are being cut as the Harris government reforms the Workers Compensation Board.<br>   Labor minister Elizabeth Witmer announced today the WCB will be replaced by another agency and benefits will be cut by five percentage points.<br>   Injured workers will receive 85 per cent of their pre-injury earnings.<br>   The new government body that will replace the WCB will be called the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board.

<hr>
<b>Ont. Immigration</b><p>
A federal study confirms that Ontario gets the lion's share of immigrants to Canada.<br>   More than half the 1.5-million immigrants who arrived in the past six years settled in Ontario -- most of them in Toronto.<br>   British Columbia was the second favorite spot, taking in 20 per cent of immigrants, while Quebec absorbed 12 per cent.<br>   Virtually none went to Saskatchewan and only two per cent went to the atlantic provinces.
<hr>
<b>Auditor General</b><p>
The federal auditor general has released his quarterly report -- and it covers everything from dangerous criminals to objects gathering dust in federal warehouses.<br>  Denis Desautels says criminals are slipping through the system because of lack of co-operation between federal and provincial governments.<br>  He also says the federal government could lose hundreds of millions of dollars because it does not know who owns what in government warehouses around the country.
<hr>
<b>Ethiopian Hijacking</b><p>
A South African couple on their honeymoon in the Comoro Islands, witnessed the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash Saturday as they sunbathed on the beach.<br>  Mr. and Mrs Dolph Hooz recorded the last moments of the plane's flight, before it crashed and broke up in the sea.<br>  They believed the low flying plane was an air show for tourists which is why Mrs. Hooz began recording.<br>    These are the first pictures to be shown of the ill-fated ethiopian airliner's final seconds.<br>  At least 120 people died in the crash.<br>  The  aircraft was hijacked on a flight from Addis Ababa to the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, when the pilot was ordered to fly to Australia.<br>   It crashed just offshore from the tourist beach as onlookers watched in horror.
<hr>
<b>Simpson Tuesday</b><p>

<hr>
<b>Sands Blown</b><p>
Talk about going out with a bang.<br>   A Las Vegas landmark, the 44-year-old Sands Hotel was demolished this morning to make way for a two billion-dollar resort.<br>   This was the third major casino to be destroyed in the past four years.<br>   The Sands once showcased the world's leading entertainers.<br>  It was the glamorous playground of top entertainers such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop and Peter Lawford, who collectively became known as the Rat Pack.
<hr>
<b>Safest City</b><p>
Thinking about moving south of the border?<br>   Looking for a safe place to live?<br>  Well the good news is you don't have to go very far.<br>  Andrew Siff takes a look at why Amherst, New York is considered one of the safest cities in the United States.

<b>Grey Cup - Family</b><p>
With just over 48 hours to go to the Grey Cup kick-off, thousands of football fans have descended on Hamilton.<br>  The city's hotels are filled to capacity.<br>  And the pace is picking up at the Grey Cup street festival.<br>  
<br>  Hamilton's population has ballooned with the influx of Grey Cup fans.<br>  Many are from out-of-town.<br>  And many more are are hometown fans, still loyally dressed in their Hamilton Ticat colours.<br>  But no matter where these people come from, they're united by one characteristic.<br>  And that's a love of football ... Canadian football.
<i> <br>As people lined up for a second day of free pancakes, served up Calgary-style, the Woolridge family was in the thick of things. Eleven-year-old Chris, and his six-year-old brother Scott skipped school today, with their father's blessing.  <br>Vern wants his kids to have the same kind of memories he has from 1972, when Hamilton hosted and won the Grey Cup.  <br>And on game day this year, Vern and his sons will be in the stands, although they won't be cheering for the same team.  <br>Dave and Bonnie Drury travelled from Sarnia to volunteer. Bonnie signed up a year ago.  <br>Fourteen-hundred volunteers are working 'round the clock to make sure Grey Cup fans have a good time.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Back to Basics</b><p>
In other news tonight...<br>  It's back to the basics for elementary students across Ontario.<br>   A new core curriculum was introduced today that will emphasize reading, writing, math, science, geography and Canadian history.<br>   Education minister John Snobelen says he wants to improve the quality of Ontario's education system and make it more accountable to parents.<br>   The provincial government is also implementing standardized report cards and province-wide testing.<br>   
<hr>
<b>Zundel Internet</b><p>
Ernst Zundel is back in the news.<br>  The well-known Toronto man who denies the existence of the holocaust, is now touting his views on the Internet.<br>  And, for the first time, the Canadian Human Rights Commission is investigating hate messages on the net.<br>  The complaints were filed by a Toronto Civic Committee on Race Relations and Toronto resident Sabina Citron. They allege the material on the computer site could expose jews to hatred or contempt on the basis of their race.<br>  No date has yet been set for the probe.  <br>  
<hr>
<b>Cochrane - Falls</b><p>
The Niagara Parks Commission has refused to allow skywalker Jay Cochrane to walk across the Niagara Gorge on a tightrope.<br>  Cochrane formally made his request to the commission board Friday morning.<br>  But the board banned stunting in the parks in 1887 and will not make an exception for Cochrane.<br>  The last walk over the gorge occurred more than a hundred years ago.

<b>Grey Cup Evening</b><p>
If you've never been to a Grey Cup before, then you've got a lot to learn about the fine art of putting on a party.<br>  Today, Hamilton kicked off its four-day Grey Cup festival, with free food, free entertainment, and free cheer good fun.<br>  Reporter Deborah Walker is standing by live in downtown Hamilton.<br>  
<br>  I never imagined you could pack so much excitement and enjoyment into a single event.<br>  If you took the grumpiest person you know, and sent them down here, I guarantee you that within minutes, they'd have a smile on their face.<br>  And if you want to really understand what the word hospitality means, then come on down to the Grey Cup Street Festival.
<i> <br>In quick succession they re-routed traffic, and fenced off King Street, so the first official event of the Grey Cup Street Festival could begin.  <br>The usual utensils just won't do when your whipping up a pancake breakfast for more than four-thousand people.  After forty-nine years, the Calgary Grey Cup Committee has it down to a fine art.  First in line, a class from Our Lady of Lourdes Elementary Cchool.  <br>And high school teacher Bob O'Connor brought his english-as-a- second language class down for a taste of Canadiana.  And no one was served unless they were willing to sport a paper stetson.  <br>The Calgary Committee says easterners are quick to embrace this western brand of spirit.  And even reporters with two left feet are drawn into the dance.  <br>Football fever is everywhere... you can even find the ghost of Grey Cups past.  <br>Hamilton has a tough act to follow, after Regina's magnificently successful Grey Cup.  But last year's hosts have faith in Hamilton's ability to rise to the occasion.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Petrocan - Oakville</b><p>
Greenpeace is launching a legal challenge to stop the expansion of a Petro-Canada refinery in Mississauga.<br>  The environmental agency says the expansion will increase the health hazards for people living near the installation.<br>   
<hr>
<b>Bernardo Aid</b><p>
Convicted killer Paul Bernardo won't get legal aid for his appeal.<br>   Bernardo plans to appeal his September 1995 first-degree murder convictions in the sex-slayings of two southern Ontario teenagers.<br>   Officials with the province's legal aid program aren't saying why his request for legal aid was turned down.<br>   Bernardo now has applied for so-called "inmate appeal."<br>  No lawyer is required for that proceeding, which is not heard before a full court.<br>  Bernardo is serving life in the Kingston Penitentiary.<br>  His dangerous offender status means he likely won't ever be eligible for parole.
<hr>
<b>Rent Control Reaction</b><p>
The Ontario government is going to make it easier for landlords to significantly raise the rent by partially removing rent controls.<br>  But as Lauran Sabourin reports tenants complain the changes go too far...<br>  while landlords charge it doesn't go far enough.
<i> <br>  That means that rent controls hikes of 2.8 percent will remain on apartments that are occupied.  <br>  But as soon as an apartment or house becomes vacant landlords will be allowed to raise the rent higher.  <br>  Eugene Linley is vacating the room he has in St. Catharines. He's looking for somethng more affordable.<br>  And with the prospects of the rents going even higher he doesn't what he's going to do.<br>  Landlords have been complaining that rents need to be raised more than the 2.8 percent that's allowed by law right now.<br>  They say builings are becoming rundown.<br>  They can't afford to renovate or repair the buildings.<br>  Even though the rent controls will be lifted on vacated units.<br>  Landlords say that creates serious inequities.<br>  One tenant paying one rent - the other paying a much higher rent for the same sized unit.<br>  The government says the intention of partially lifting rent controls is to encourage more building of rental housing.<br>  To give landlords more money to do needed repairs.<br>  But critics charge that the likely result of this new tenant protection legislation will be tenants paying higher rents for run down apartments. </i>
<hr>
<b>Phantom 3000</b><p>
Another milestone for the canadian production of "The Phantom of the Opera".<br>  Tonight, the Pantages Theatre curtain will rise for the three thousandth time, adding to the numerous records the show has amassed since opening in 1989.<br>   Now in it's eighth year, the Toronto "Phantom" is the longest running musical hit in the history of Canadian theatre.

<hr>
<b>grey cup advance</b><p>
The barricades are up.<br>  The beer tents are ready.<br>  And if football fans would only buy up more tickets, organizers of Hamilton's Grey Cup would be blissfully happy.<br>  This is the eve of a four-day celebration that will culminate in Sunday's CFL final between the Toronto Argonauts and the Edmonton Eskimos.<br>  
<br>  The party doesn't officially start until tomorrow.<br>  But party tents have already sprouted up all over the city of Hamilton.<br>  And bars and restaurants are already doing a brisk business.<br>  That's because the Grey Cup invasion is already underway.
<i> <br>The media has formed the advance guard.  250 journalists and photographers from coast-to-coast have registered for Grey Cup accreditation, with another two-hundred standing by for live coverage on game day.  <br>And the media aren't the only ones in town. The Argonauts and the Eskimos are here. And you can't walk through a hotel lobby in Hamilton without spotting football legends like Tommy Joe Coffey and Angelo Mosca. Everywhere, organizers are putting the finishing touches on plans for the four-day party leading up to the Grey Cup game. </i>
<br>  Three-quarters of the 42-thousand Grey Cup tickets have now been sold.<br>  Ironically, when we stopped by the ticket office earlier today, orders were coming in from New York state.<br>  It seems a shame we have to count on Americans to help sell out Canada's national game.
<hr>
<b>Ontario Math</b><p>
An international study of educational standards was released today, and surprisingly, Ontario's students don't fair very well, even against the other provinces.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Nat. Child Day Demo</b><p>
Today is national child day.<br>  And a group called "Justice for Children and Youth", are calling on the Harris goverment to make changes to stop the abuse of young offenders in detention centres across Ontario.<br>   The group demonstrated at Queens Park today in an effort to focus attention on the death of teenager James Lonnie.<br>  Lonnie died from head injuries last September after being put into an adult cell at a Guelph jail.<br>  The group is also demanding solicitor general Bob Runciman stop the inhumane treatment of young inmates at two provincial dentention centres.
<hr>
<b>Compulsive Gambling</b><p>
Casino and racetrack gamblers in Ontario will soon be able to try their luck on video lottery terminals.<br>   The Tory government recently passed legislation to allow the VLT's at casinos and racetracks.<br>  And while many of the province's gamblers are excited, opponents fear the worst.<br>    
<hr>
<b>Fergie - Toronto</b><p>
Sarah Ferguson is in Toronto to promote her autobiography "My Story."<br>   The 37-year-old Duchess of York will appear on several shows today.<br>   Fergie spent the past week on the U.S. talk show circuit.<br>   One British newspaper, The Guardian, recently ran a front-page headline reading "Exclusive! No Fergie Interview Inside!"

<hr>
<b>Education Cuts</b><p>
Education minister John Snobelen was under attack on two fronts today, because of his cuts to education spending.<br>   Both public school directors of education, and angry parents are demanding input into educational reform being contemnplated by the Harris government.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Nurses Demo</b><p>
Hundreds of nurses converged on the lawn at Queens Park today.<br>  They were demanding a meeting with premier Mike Harris.<br>   The nurses, who marched up University Avenue to the Ontario Legislature, were protesting government cuts to hospital funding.<br>  Those cuts have resulted in hudreds of nurses being laid off.<br>  They say such wholesale cuts are not necessary, and the nurses want to get that message to the premier.
<hr>
<b>Workfare Update</b><p>
The pressure is on municipalities to come up with a plan of how they're going to implement workfare.<br>  Municipalities that are dragging their feet on workfare, are being threatened with paying the start up costs.<br>   But Niagara Region isn't worried about a penalty.<br>  It plans to be one of the first to get its welfare recipients to work for their money.
<hr>
<b>Palladini - 407</b><p>
Ontario's auditor, Erik Peters says safety standards were lowered in a deal with the former NDP government, so that the new 407 highway could be built for a maximum price of 930-million dollars.<br>  Transportation minister Al Palladini says the highway is safe, but he is prepared to conduct an independant inspection, just to be on the safe side.         The independent safety audit could delay the opening of the new highway, which was set for next month.
<hr>
<b>Weeping Icon</b><p>
The jury is still out on whether it's a miracle, but Toronto police say there's no evidence of fraud in claims of a weeping icon in a tiny church.<br>   Police say there's no proof of any financial gain by those involved with a Greek Orthodox church in East York.<br>  The icon, a copy of a 12 hundred-year-old painting of the Virgin Mary, allegedly began weeping last August.<br>  Large amounts of cash were donated when reports of the icon became public.
<hr>
<b>Young Offenders</b><p>
Most youths over the age of 14 found guilty of serious violent offences should be transferred to adult court for sentencing.<br>  That is the advice of a task force of federal, provincial and territorial justice officials.<br>  Under reforms passed last year, 16 and 17 year olds charged with serious violent crimes must be tried as adults unless they can persuade a judge that they should stay in youth court.
<hr>
<b>Chunnel</b><p>
Turning to international news, a smoky fire broke out in the middle of the tunnel under the waters separating Britain and France...injuring several people.<br>   It was the worst accident since the fifteen-mile-long "Chunnel" opened two years ago.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Ghali Vote</b><p>
The United States has vetoed Boutros Boutros-Ghali for re-election as U.N. secretary- general.<br>  But Boutros-Ghali won't go quietly.<br>  He has refused to withdraw his candidacy despite the veto.<br>  That sets the stage for a protracted battle in which the United States has so far found itself diplomatically isolated.<br>   Washington announced in June that it intended to block Boutros-Ghali's re-election, saying the U.S. wanted new leadership to implement reforms.
<hr>
<b>Israel Beating</b><p>
Israel's border police arrested two officers after they were caught on video beating and kicking a group of Palestinians.<br>   The video shows the troops apparently unaware of an amateur Palestinian cameraman nearby as they attacked the six Arab men.<br>   One officer kicked a man in the head and the footage also shows the israelis apparently forcing the Palestinians to do push-ups.<br>   A passerby who stops to ask questions is smacked in the face.

<b>Zaire extra</b><p>
Prime minister Chretien says Canada is determined to press ahead with the international rescue mission for central Africa, despite the mass return of refugees to Rwanda.<br>   Chretien says: "we have to go there and we have to go for humanitarian purposes."<br>    About 500-thousand Rwandan refugees have returned home in recent days, but Chretien says the government is still worried about the half-million still in Zaire.
<hr>
<b>Home Sweet Home</b><p>
CNN's Christiane Amanpour is in Rwanda and reports now on the journey of the nearly one million refugees who are back home ... how they got there and what they found when they arrived.
<hr>
<b>Child Poverty</b><p>
Groups fighting child poverty are sugesting a child's equivalent to the Canada Pension Plan.<br>  Campaign Two Thousand says its proposed social investment fund would lift eight hundred thousand children out of poverty.<br>  That would put Canada on track to keeping a promise to eliminate child poverty made to the United Nations in 1989.<br>  Since then, child poverty in Canada has almost doubled.

<b>Rape Suspect - Court</b><p>
A Thornhill man faces six charges in connection with two sexual assaults last week in Vaughan, just north of Toronto.<br>  A woman was grabbed last Sunday while walking near a park.<br>  On Thursday, a woman fought off an attacker in the same area.<br>  Police say 23-year-old Jeremy Foster has been charged with two counts of sexual assault, and one count each of threatening death, wearing a disguise, robbery and forcible confinement.       <br> Toronto police have not laid charges against Foster in connection with two recent sexual assaults in suburban North York.

<b>Ontario sale</b><p>
Premier Mike Harris says he hopes a 17-million dollar advertising blitz will help create jobs by increasing direct foreign investment in Ontario.<br>   Harris held a worldwide TV teleconference today -- to sell Ontario to the world as a great place to do business.<br>   The premier says just a two per cent increase in foreign investment should create thousands of new jobs for Ontario.<br>

<b>Grey Cup Day One</b><p>
Its the Argos and Eskimos in the CFL Final this Sunday in Hamilton. With the Grey Cup challengers ready to play, Matt Hayes reports that the only challenge left is to sellout the stadium.
<i><br>  There's no doubt about it. Grey Cup organizers were thrilled by Toronto's victory in yesterdays CFL Eastern Final.<br>  By the weekend ticket sales had just past the 30 thousand mark. The impact of the Toronto-Edmonton matchup is just starting to be felt at the roar store ticket office.<br>  That means about 7 thousand tickets are still available. Its hoped those seats will be purchased by anxious Argo and Eskimo fans.<br>  Surprisingly I found many Argo fans on the streets of Hamilton today.<br>  </i>

<b>Smoking Rates Up</b><p>
Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health has sounded an alarm to an emerging health crisis in the province.<br>   He says increases in the number of people who smoke... is a deadly time bomb that will have enormous consequences, if governments don't take tough action to butt it out.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Ontario Quebec</b><p>
Quebec's separation would devastate Ontario's economy.<br>   That's according to secret government studies.<br>   The Globe and Aail reports provincial research has found that if Quebec departs, increased spending and a loss of taxes would cost this province 16 and a half billion dollars a year.<br>   The studies also suggest most people leaving Quebec would move to Ontario, driving up social assistance costs.<br>     The newspaper has been trying to obtain the studies, but the Harris government is refusing to make them public.
<hr>
<b>Days of Action</b><p>
A top Ontario labor leader has dropped some strong hints about where the next "Days of Action" protests will be held.<br>   Sid Ryan, the head of CUPE Ontario, says Sudbury is among several cities that could be picked for protests next year.<br>   Other cities in the running are North Bay -- which is the premier's home riding -- as well as Thunder Bay and Windsor.<br>   Ryan says the protests would start in February and run into the summer.
<hr>
<b>C.A.A. - Roads</b><p>
Groups representing canadian drivers say the federal government has to shift into high gear to save the country's highways.<br>  The Canadian Automobile Association and the Coalition to Renew Canada's Infrastructure had two people drive from Victoria to St. John's ... they say our highways are falling apart.
<hr>
<b>Hong Kong #4</b><p>
There are continued warnings from Hong Kong about the security of democrat rights and freedoms, after China takes over the colony next year.<br>  Beijing has warned it will not tolerate attacks on its leadership after the takeover.<br>  For the young, coping with China is a worrying uncertainty.<br>  Tonight in "countdown in Hong Kong", we'll meet some Canadian students who live in the colony.<br>  They have surprising observations about the future of Hong Kong's freedoms.
<hr>
<b>Jacksons Bride</b><p>
Michael Jackson is marrying the woman carrying his baby.<br>   The king of pop was expected to exchange wedding vows today with six-months pregnant Debbie Rowe during a private ceremony in Sydney, Australia.<br>   Jackson is 38 and the bride-to-be, a longtime friend and nurse to his plastic surgeon, is 37.<br>

</ul>
<hr>
<b>Crombie - Education</b><p>
The provincially appointed so-called "who does what panel" has recommended several changes to the education system in Ontario.<br>  At the forefront is a suggestion that the Ontario government pay a bigger share of the cost of education...<br> The panel chaired by David Crombie also wants the number of school boards cut in half.<br>  As Jamie West reports... initial reaction to the recommendations is mixed.
<i><br>  Reducing duplication in government is the mandate of the who does what panel.<br>  To that end the panel recommends school boards focus on activities that relate directly to classroom activity, and leave maintenance transportation and construction to private firms or municipalities.<br>  The panel wants the number of school boards cut in half with most boards having the same boundries as counties or regional governments...in some cases that will put more money into the hands of some boards that have a lower tax base ...<br>  Further school boards would be allowed to collect up to 5% of their budgets from property taxes instead of an average 50 percent levee, the province would pick up the rest of the cost.<br>  Provincial grants to school boards would be based on a new per-pupil grant, and a new province wide rate for industrial and commercial property taxes imposed. To be monitored by an advisory body of school trustees, educators, business and parents... Other union leaders say the recommendations if accepted would produce thousands of layoffs. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Docs Dicipline</b><p>
Ontario's College of Physicians and Surgeons has rejected a request from the Harris government, to punish doctors who are taking part in in a province wide protest. 
<hr>
<b>Clinton Zaire</b><p>
The United States will participate in "a limited fashion" in a Canadian-led military operation to help refugees in Zaire.<br>   U.S. president Clinton is considering deploying about one-thousand ground troops in the operation.<br>   France, Spain and several African countries are also expected to provide soldiers.<br>   Prime minister Chretien has said the first members of the force could be on the ground in Zaire 48 hours after the United Nations approves the operation.
<hr>
<b>Hong Kong #3</b><p>
Only a few years ago, 80 percent of all of China's exports passed through Hong Kong on the way to international markets.<br>  The colony made a lot of money as China's middleman.<br>  But that's changing.<br>  After the Chinese takeover, Hong Kong will be a Chinese city, and a very expensive one.<br>  Already, many companies have moved their operations to chaper Chinese centers.<br>

<hr>
<b>Zaire - Chretien</b><p>
Canada, has stepped to the forefront of the world stage ... in a bid to end the suffering of more than a million refugees, in Zaire. The prime minister announced today, that Canadian troops are heading to that African nation, in a bid to referee the ethnic battles, that are killing more than a thousand civilians a day:
<i><br> The refugees are pouring out ... but only a trickle of relief supplies are making their way in... to war torn Zaire.<br>  Viscious ethnic warfare has made it impossible for the United Nations to reach those who need help the most: <br>  Its estimated that a million refugees are on the move without food or water; and up to a thousand a day are dying, as they flee the horrors of war. <br>  Raymond Chretien, nephew of the prime minister ... and U.N. special envoy ... has been negotiating with the two factions, and today ... there was a breakthrough:  <br>  And back home, the response was immediate: the prime minister will send a 350 member rapid response team ... followed by more Canadian troops, and support units; to separate the warring factions, and bring aid to the refugees: <br>  Chretien's announcement was immediately hailed by UN secretary general Bhoutros Bhoutros Gali ... <br>  Putting foreign nationals under Canadian command may keep a reluctant president Clinton on the sidelines in this dispute. Whether Canada has the muscle to go it alone in Zaire, without American military might... could determine whether this mission of mercy is ultimately successful... or not. </i>
<hr>
<b>Police Funding</b><p>
A government panel recommends the province start charging almost 600 municipalities for police services they currently get for free.<br>   That would save the tory government 100-million dollars annually. But some rural areas that would be forced to pay, are objecting.
<hr>
<b>Catholic Teachers</b><p>
Metro Toronto's Catholic high school teachers are on a work-to-rule campaign.<br>   That means no extra-curricular sports or programs at 37 high schools.<br>   Picket lines went up between class time at the region's Catholic high schools.<br>   Some students joined teachers on the line.<br>   The 21-hundred teachers want an extra 15-hundred dollars a year in wages.<br>   The Separate School Board says the pay hike would cost it eight-million dollars a year.
<hr>
<b>Plane Crash</b><p>
Hundreds are feared dead in an aviation disaster near New Delhi.<br>   Two airliners collided near the Indian capital, falling to earth in two fireballs that showered wreckage over a wide area of farmland.<br>   About 350 people were aboard the aircraft -- a Saudi Airways jumbo jet and a Kazak airliner.<br>   It's believed all aboard were killed -- as well as some victims on the ground.
<hr>
<b>Hong Kong 2</b><p>
Less than 8 months remain until China takes over Britains last colony.<br>  But, hundreds of thousands of people have taken the precaution of acquiring a foreign passport.<br>  Many are nervous about living under the same rulers that ordered the massacre in Tianamen Square.<br>  Canada leads the international community, doling out more passports to people in the colony that the U.S. or even Britain, 40 thousand last year alone.<br>  But many of the new Canadians didn't stay in Canada ... they've returned and are hoping for the best.

Frank Sinatra remains in a Los Angeles hospital amid reports that his health problems may be more serious than originally announced.<br>   When the 80-year-old singer entered hospital a week ago, his publicist said it was for treatment of a "pinched nerve."<br>   But a Los Angeles TV station says sinatra is being treated for both heart failure and pneumonia.
<hr>
<b>Belafonte</b><p>
More than 800 students received their degrees, as McMaster University held fall convocation ceremonies today at Hamilton Place.<br>  But as Alex Reynolds reports, a familiar, famous face, that of singer Harry Belafonte, was among the recipients.
<i> <br>  Over the years, the Great Hall has been home for Belafonte as an entertainer.<br>  On this occasion, he was being honored academically.<br>  His work in the cause of human rights, and that of his wife Julie, has been recognized by McMaster University...the hoarse-voiced singer was obviously overwhelmed. <br>  During his convocation address, the singer paid hommage to those who pioneered the path for black entertainers. <br>  Hamilton fans feel Harry is one of their own ...the doctor of laws degree is an added symbol. <br>  There are many honors for the calypso singer- turned-doctor, who believes "the role of art isn't just to show life as it is....but to show life as it should be."<br>  </i>

<hr>
<b>MPP - Probe</b><p>
 Attorney general Charles Harnick has ordered a criminal investigation of two New Democrat MPPs. Harnick says Welland Thorold MPP Peter Kormos and Sudbury East MPP Shelley Martel are alleged to have breached security at the province's family support plan offices near Toronto. 

<hr>
<b>Hospital Cuts</b><p>
Ontario hospital bed closures could be far more extensive than previously expected.<br>   The powerful Health Services Restructuring Commission says the province could lose roughly 20 per cent of its acute-care beds in a major overhaul.<br>   That's one out of every five beds currently in use.<br>   However, commission chairman Duncan Sinclair says the public shouldn't judge the quality of health care by the number of beds.<br>   He says you can no longer equate the number of beds with the level of service provided by a hospital.
<hr>
<b>Ortho Docs</b><p>
    Thousands of Ontario doctors meanwhile, are poised to stop taking new patients tomorrow.<br>   Negotiations with the government failed to settle their demands for more money and the right to work where they choose.<br>   Some doctors have already stopped seeing new patients.<br>   The doctors and the government are still talking in Toronto.
<hr>
<b>Truck Rules</b><p>
Queen's Park is out to make it tougher for unsafe truck operators.<br>  A bill introduced today by transport minister Al Palladini, would give the province's registrar of motor vehicles new powers... including penalizing trucking companies who operate rigs that don't meet safety standards and refusing to give new licenses to disreputable firms.<br>   Safety records of trucking firms would also be made public.
<br>  Once the bill becomes law... firms caught operating unsafe trucks would be brought to justice sooner.
<hr>
<b>OFL Protest Follow</b><p>
To shut down or not to shut down -- that seems to be a tough question now for Ontario's labor movement.<br>   At a Toronto meeting of the Ontario Federation of Labor today, Ontario's most powerful unions appeared split over the future of labour's "days of action".<br>   Sid Ryan of the Canadian Union of Public Employees in Ontario, says the old standard will be upheld.<br>   But John Murphy of the Powerworkers Union says mass protests like the recent one in Toronto, have not succeeded in winning public support.
<hr>
<b>Chlorine Water</b><p>
A new study suggests that chlorine-treated drinking water could be killing people.<br>   In studying five-thousand Ontario residents, Health Canada suggests chlorinated water causes more than 500 cases of cancer and 140 deaths each year.<br>   It concludes the reaction of chlorine with decaying organic material, creates carcino-genic by-products known as THM's in the water.<br>   Researchers think these by-products cause bladder and colon cancers.
<hr>
<b>Migraine Drug</b><p>
Three and a half million Canadians suffer from migraine headaches and now there's a new product being touted as a relief from the affliction.<br>  A nasal spray called Migranal has been approved for use in Canada.<br>  The drug itself has been around for 50 years, but has never been available in spray.<br>  Doctors say pills are less effective because they aren't absorbed as qickly in the system.<br>  Specialsists claim that migraines account for almost seven million lost work days, every year in Canada.
<hr>
<b>Christopher Retires</b><p>
America's top diplomat is stepping down.<br>  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced his resignation earlier today at the white house.<br>    
<hr>
<b>Mars</b><p>
An U.N.-staffed U.S. spacecraft is on its way to Mars after a successful noontime launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida.<br>   Interest in further exploration of the "red planet" is high, following recent scientific findings that primitive life forms may have existed there.<br>   NASA officials say sending humans on a mission to Mars may not be that far off.            <br>  The "Global Surveyor" will replace a Mars probe that was lost three-years ago.<br>   After a 10-month journey, it will enter an orbit and map the planet's surface with a high-resolution camera.<br>  It's the first of 10 spacecraft the U.S. will send to Mars in the next decade.
<hr>
<b>Fergie Book</b><p>
Scarlet hussy or persecuted flop?<br>   Take your pick from two new, unabashed books about Sarah Ferguson.<br>   One called "My Story" describes life in the royal family by Fergie herself...<br>  The other "Her Secret Life" is an unflattering version written by a former pal Allan Starkie.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Best Cities</b><p>
Vancouver, Toronto, Zurich and Geneva are the best cities in the world for expatriates to live in.<br>   That's the finding of a study published by the Geneva-based Corporate Resources Group.<br>   It ranked Toronto and Vancouver at the top because of their "combination of social stability, excellent infrastructure and good leisure facilities."<br>   Sarajevo ranked at the bottom of the list.

<hr>
<b>GRE Taxes / Charges</b><p>
One of the largest employers on the Six Nations Reserve outside Brantford is in limbo after the RCMP laid charges over the weekend against its founders.<br>  32 people work at Grand River Enterprises, a cigarette manufacturing plant.<br>  The company was looking to expand, but some on the reserve feel that very expansion is where the charges stem.<br>  Annette Hamm explains.
<i><br>  The general manager of Grand River Enterprises says the cigarette plant is now operating on a day to day basis.<br>  This after he and eight other founding members of the business were charged late last week by the RCMP.<br>  Police say GREe has illegally made and sold cigarettes without a licence since early 1994.  <br>  GRE recently applied for a licence to service other nations across Canada.<br>  They were waiting for a response to that application when the charges were laid.  <br>  Six Nations Band Council chief Wellington Staats feels there's more at issue here than Grand River Enterprises ... he feels it's a violation of tax privileges.<br>  And he's worried about the implications for other businesses on the reserve.  <br>  Chief Staats says he may ask the Ministry of Native Affairs to intervene in the case.<br>  </i>
<hr>

<hr>
<b>Flu Update</b><p>
Well it's that time of year again.... the time when that nasty flu-bug attacks unsuspecting victims with a vegeance.<br>  But there is a way of preventing an unwelcome bout with the flu.... get a flu shot.<br>  Employers are just beginning to recognize the economic benefits of the flu vaccine.

<b>Doctors Vote</b><p>
The council of the Ontario Medical Association has rejected a tentative deal with the Harris government. The OMA's 250 council members followed the advice of the province's doctors in turning thumbs down on the agreement. About three-quarters of doctors who voted in a province- wide referendum rejected the deal. 
<hr>
<b>GM Oshawa</b><p>
General Motors says a U.S. strike isn't hampering production at its truck plant in Oshawa... yet. The truck plant is running all three shifts today. But things will be re-evaluated tomorrow. Spokesman Stew Low says GM will do what it can to keep the plant stocked with parts. About 75-hundred American GM workers are out at plants in Wisconsin and Indianapolis. 
<hr>
<b>Overcrowded Jails</b><p>
Jails throughout the golden horseshoe are busting at the seams... triple bunking in cells has now become commonplace... and as Ian Dovey reports tonight ... guards are worried not only about their own safety...but that of inmates.                       
<I><br>  Another inmate arrives at the Hamilton Wentworth Detention Centre adding to what the guards say is an dangerous overcrowded situation inside.<br>  There are more than 400 inmates inside the facility, many of them are being double or triple bunked in a cell no wider than four feet. <br>    Quincy Morgan says the additional inmates are coming from correctional facilities in Toronto because they're filled to capacity. <br>     In the legislature, Liberal leader Lyn Mcleod has accused solicitor general Bob Runciman of ignoring the volatile situation, saying the Hamilton facility is a powder keg ready to blow.<br>   According to guards it came close to that a week ago Sunday when some inmates throw their food trays to the ground and refused to go back in their cells. <br>     A Ministry of Corrections offical says bed space is limited at all institutions in southern Ontario, but acknowledged the Hamilton Wentworth Detention Centre is a pressure point adding the situation is being constantly monitored in a reasonable and responsible way.<br>  </I>
<hr>
<b>Niagara Growth</b><p>
A senior official of the Royal Bank is forecasting boom times for the Niagara Region. Royal vice- president Gord Feeny says the region could post the highest economic growth in the province over the next five years. A similar forecast was made last month by the Business Development Bank of Canada.
<hr>
<b>Ginseng Bar</b><p>
An ancient Chinese secret is the root of the latest trend in healthy, Canadian snack foods. A new, low fat snack bar rolled off the production line at Sunny Crunch Foods in Markham this afternoon.

<hr>
<b>Grapes In</b><p>
The grape harvest season is just about over and Niagara Grape Growers are calling 1996 a year they would rather forget.<br>  Lauran Sabourin has more now on this years dismal growing season.
<i><br>  The cool wet weather has taken it's toll on the grape crop and the Niagara grape growers this year. <br>  The vineyards are full of mud.. so muddy that on some days it's almost impossible to get the harvesters running without getting bogged down.<br>  The rains started just as the harvest was beginning... <br>  The Grape Growers Marketing Board keeps a runing tally on how much rain has fallen in Niagara .. <br>  Since the harvest began a foot of rain has fallen in the vineyards.<br>  The average rainfall is about half that... <br>  Excessive rain can have a damageing effect on a grape crop.<br>  The grapes need warm weather and lots of sun to produce sugar.<br>  Sugar makes a better quality grape.<br>  A better quality wine.<br>  The more sugar in the grapes, the more the grower is paid. <br>  A challenging year because the quality of the crop is down.<br>  The quantity of the crop is down.<br>  While consumers wont' notice any difference in the quality of the wines. <br>  In 1996 there are fewer premium grapes produced.<br>  There will be fewer premium wine bottles on the shelves.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Docs - Deal</b><p>
Ontario doctors are putting together a last minute offer to their leadership aimed at avoiding a mass withdrawl of services which could take place on Friday. <br>    Doctors have been voting by mail on a deal worked out by the province and the Ontario Medical Association, which would give doctors more money.<br>   But new doctors would have to go to underserviced areas in order to receive billing numbers.<br>   A group of physicians representing family doctors and specialists want government assurances that negotiations will still take place even if the deal is turned down. <br>  Votes will be counted tomorrow, but it could be as late as midnight before the results are made public.
<hr>
<b>Students</b><p>
A published essay in the Toronto Star gives very poor marks to the thousands of students who head off to university each year after completing high school.<br>  The article was written by 22 university professors.<br>  Dwight Ryan has the story..       
<i><br>  They're a sorry lot.  The thousands of students who each year graduate from Ontario high schools and head off to university.<br>  In a lengthy article published in the Toronto Star, nearly two dozen professors detail their dismay.<br>  They say 'new students are less and less well prepared for the university."<br>  In fact they are "less and less able to comprehend the same books..to listen attentively..to take lecture notes...to prepare for an exam...to write a paper." and the list goes on.<br>  To top it off the profs "see a steady and alarming long-term decline."<br>  Among the professors signing the article was Dravko Planinc, who teaches religious studies at Hamilton's McMaster University.<br>  He notes in new students a lack of curiosity.  <br>    Professor Planinc believes the malaise begins as early as daycare and puts the blame partly on television...    <br>  The professors believe province-wide testing will help parents learn how their local schools measure up.<br>  And its something the Tories at Queens Park have in the works.   <br>    McMaster president Peter George also believes in province-wide testing.  But he believes the majority of undergraduates are qualified.   </i>
<hr>
<b>Bus Ads</b><p>
Education minister John Snobelen says he's not totally opposed to advertising on school buses.<br>   But the minister says many parents won't like the idea.<br>   Some school boards plan to sell advertising on their buses.<br>   Snobelen says the province doesn't want it to look like the school system is endorsing commercial products.
<hr>
<b>Spouse Rule</b><p>
An Ontario court has upheld the legality of the Harris government's contentious "spouse-in -the-house" rule for welfare recipients.<br>   The regulation, which took effect a year ago, says live-in partners of the opposite sex, are a "spouse" with an obligation to support the welfare recipient.<br>   Social services minister Janet Ekker says however the rule is not all inclusive. <br>  Although a three judge panel of the court says the rules are within the power of the legislature, the judges were split over whether the rules breach the Charter of Rights of those on welfare.
<hr>
<b>Taxi-24 Sussex</b><p>
The prime minister's residence at 24 Sussex has had its share of break-ins over the past year, but nothing like what happened today.<br>  A taxi coming out of the governor- general's residence across the street, lost control and smashed into the wall that surrounds 24 Sussex.<br>  The embarassed driver apparently had no intention of taking a closer look at the prime minister's house.
<hr>
<b>Halloween Business</b><p>
From treats to costumes, masks to wigs, Halloween is no longer just for kids.<br>  In fact as we see in this report, it's become a multi-billion dollar business.

<b>Schools - Snobelen</b><p>
Education minister John Snobelen is warning school boards he won't accept larger classroom sizes or education tax increases as a way to compensate for cuts in provincial funding.<br>   
<hr>
<b>Harris - Docs</b><p>
Premier Mike Harris today urged doctors to vote in favor of a deal worked out between the government and the Ontario Medical Association.<br>   Doctors have been angered by education minister Wilson who says no matter how the vote goes on Thursday, he is going ahead with a ban on new doctors in certain over-serviced areas of the province.<br>  Premier Harris says the agreement is only short term and doctors should show good faith by radifying it, so bargaining can continue. <br>  If doctors vote down the deal, it likely will mean come November first, many physicians will refuse to take new patients.
<hr>
<b>Memo </b><p>
A memo being sent to federal Liberals, outlines a strategy to make the Reform Party look bad to the voters.<br>   The memo, which was obtained by a Toronto newspaper, comes from the prime minister's office and suggests that Liberals say the Reform Party is in the pocket of the gun lobby, and uses the rhetoric of the extreme right in the U.S.<br>  It also says voters should be told that Reform is trying to boost its fortunes by exacerbating the tensions with Quebec and between rich and poor.
<hr>
<b>Immigration Plan</b><p>
Immigration minister Lucienne Robillard says Canada could handle a big increase in immigration -- but Canadians aren't ready to accept it.<br>   Robillard says Canada expects to welcome between 195 and 220-thousand immigrants next year.<br>   That's the same target as this year and last.
<hr>
<b>MMT Study</b><p>
An oil industry group says a controversial fuel additive that is slated to be banned by the federal government is not harmful... and they have tests to prove it.<br>  The government says the additive, "MMT", wrecks vehicles diagnostic systems and leads to increased air pollution.<br>  But the Canadian Petroleum Product Institute says it commissioned an independent test that shows MMT is safe.
<hr>
<b>Collapse Survivor</b><p>
Turning to international news, rescue workers in Cairo say it is a miracle.<br>   They pulled a Los Angeles teen-ager from the ruins of a collapsed apartment building in the Edyptian capital earlier today.<br> 18 year-old Samantha Makscher was bruised and bleeding after her 36-hour ordeal, but alive.<br>  At least 22 survivors have been found since Sunday's collapse.<br>  The unofficial death toll stands at 18.<br>   It's not known what caused the cave-in, but the city has a reputaiton for poor construction standards.
<hr>
<b>Mideast Tension</b><p>
While peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis appear deadlocked, fears are now growing that Syria may try to move the diplomatic process along with military might.<br>   
<hr>
<b>New Money</b><p>
The Ruble will never win any beauty contests, with it's majestic scenes of hydroelectric plants it may make the engineering crowd proud but other Russians have a more poetic vision of their Ruble.<br>   A campaign is underway to get the faces of famous Russians on the bills but so far the government is not agreeing to a revision.

<hr>
<b>Ford Talks</b><p>
Ford faces a strike deadline by its unionized workers next week.<br> The Canadian Auto Workers announced today it has set the strike deadline for 7:00 p-m, Wednesday, November 6th. Ford and the CAW began contract talks today in Toronto.<br> CAW president Buzz Hargrove thinks an agreement can be reached with Ford without a strike but he says the talks with Ford won't be a cakewalk.
<hr>
<b>GM Talks U.S.</b><p>
Meanwhile, a strike deadline has passed in the U.S.... but United Auto Workers remain on the job at General Motors' plants across the country, and the two sides are still trying to hammer out a new labor contract.<br> 
<hr>
<b>GM - CAW</b><p>
The Canadian Auto Workers union says it will back its American counterpart if it goes on strike against General Motors.  Even though bargaining continues, a strike against GM in the states would likely mean layoffs in Canada, where GM workers recently settled a three-week strike.  GM of Canada workers rely on parts from the U.S.
<hr>
<b>Wilson - Docs</b><p>
Health minister Jim Wilson is talking tough in a dispute with the province's 20-thousand doctors.<br> Wilson says his government has no intention of renegotiating a tentative agreement reached with the Ontario Medical Association.<br> Under the deal, the province would claw back about three per cent of doctors' earnings instead of the current 10 per cent.<br> However, new doctors would be forced to work in underserviced areas, like the north.<br> While the OMA supports the deal, groups representing a large number of doctors are recommending that it be voted down.<br> If there is no agreement by November 1st, some doctors say they will stop taking on new patients.<br> Doctors with the Ottawa Academy of Medicine voted against a deal with the province, they met at an Ottawa hospital yesterday and decided they cannot support an agreement that doesn't put more money into health care.  The OMA will count votes from doctors across Ontario Thursday.
<hr>
<b>Nursing Home Bill</b><p>
Hamilton East Liberal MPP Dominic Agostino is blaming the Harris government's spending cuts for a 93 year old Burlington woman being billed nine thousand dollars for her stay in Joseph Brant Hospital. Catharine Duffy has been charged 120-dollars a-day since April because she would not accept being moved to a nursing home outside the Halton region. In the legislature today... Agostino asked health minister Wilson to come to Mrs. Duffy's aid. <br>    Halton has the worst shortage of nursing home beds in Ontario.
<hr>
<b>Runciman Bluewater</b><p>
Several young offenders who say jail managers beat them following a riot last winter are suing Ontario's solicitor general over the incident.<br> The suit was delivered to solicitor general Bob Runciman today and alleges the 12 youths were "abused, tortured, manipulated and incited to riot."<br> A statement from the complainants' lawyer, Jeffrey Wilson, says "the minister apparently couldn't care less" about the youths.<br> The statement says the "young offenders seek judicial accountability, compensation for their pain and suffering."<br> Ontario's children's advocate has said that 40 young offenders were beaten after being transferred to the Elgin-Middlesex Detention Centre in London during a civil service strike last March.<br> The alleged beatings occurred after the youths were taken from the Bluewater Youth Centre in Goderich after a riot there.<br> London police and the province are investigating the allegations.
<hr>
<b>Liberal Convention</b><p>
The federal Liberal party has approved a resolution that would allow doctor-assisted suicide in Canada. But, wrapping up the party's four-day convention in Ottawa, prime minister Chretien admitted it's a delicate issue that won't be resolved swiftly. Riding high in the polls and with an election expected next year, Liberals watered down or withdrew controversial resolutions that could divide the party.  Chretien told delegates they must speak with one voice in all parts of the country.
<hr>
<b>Trucking Poll</b><p>
A new poll suggests Canadians are worried about commercial trucking safety.<br> An Angus Reid survey finds 80 per cent of respondents feel the growing number of transport trucks is making driving more dangerous.<br> The group; Canadians for Responsible and Safe Highways, is also pushing for a lower limit on the number of hours truckers can drive without a break.
<hr>
<b>Higher Fines</b><p>
New and higher truck and bus fines have taken effect in Ontario.<br> Transportation minister Al Palladini announced today that new legislation will more than triple minimum truck and bus fines from 60 dollars to between 200 and 400 dollars.<br> The legislation increases maximum trucking and bus fines by 10 times -- to 20-thousand dollars.<br> Palladini says "safety violations will simply not be tolerated on Ontario roads."<br> A statement from the minister says many companies consider existing truck fines "nothing more than the cost of doing business."<br> Palladini says he feels these higher fines will act as stronger deterrents.<br>   These changes apply equally to commercial truck drivers and intercity bus drivers.
<hr>
<b>Bank Rate</b><p>
If you're in the market for a bank loan....tomorrow could be the day. There will be another drop in interest rates. Canada's major banks are cutting their benchhmark prime lending rates tomorrow to five per cent.<br> That's down a quarter percentage point.<br> The central bank dropped its bank rate today to 3.5 per cent because the dollar has been rising on exchange markets.<br> The drop is the tenth the central bank has made this year in an effort to stoke a sputtering economy. It will likely spark another round of interest rate cuts in mortgages which are already at generational lows. The Bank of Montreal led the way this morning, cutting some of its variable mortgage rates up to a quarter of a per cent.

<b>Toronto Protest </b><p>
Toronto stood still today.<br>  Thousands of anti-government protesters converged on the city today.<br>  Factories were shut. Schools closed. And many workers simply stayed home.<br> It was all part of Labour's Days of Action.
<hr>
<b>Traffic</b><p>
They were predicting traffic chaos.. and many people stayed home to avoid the headaches of trying to get into and around the city.... <br>    But those who did that, missed a real treat today... traffic that actually moved... traffic reporters described the pace as being that of a Sunday ... far fewer cars than usual and no problems to report... in fact the OPP could have done a booming business handing out speeding tickets the flow was so smooth and so fast.
<hr>
<b>Docs Vote</b><p>
The Harris government is facing another big test this weekend other than the big rally... a voted by Ontario's 20 thousand doctors could kill the tenative deal that the Ontario Medication Association has struck with the government. And if that happens, this province will be facing a widespread strike by doctors in exactly one week from today... Lauran Sabourin reports.
<i><br>  The doctors objections centre on a section of the agreement that bans new physicians from location in overserviced areas such as Toronto for the next two years.<br>  Dr. Robert Fallis, a family physician in St. Catharines is voting against the agreement this weekend. <br>  As he sees it forcing newer doctors into underserviced areas is canibalizing young physicians.<br>  The 2.9 foot rope is in reference to the percentage of billings the government is asking doctors to give back. <br>  Tthe Harris government was demanding a 10 percent clawback.<br>  It's agreed to reduce that to 2.9 percent. And in 1998 get rid of the clawback altogether. <br>  But the doctors say they've been cheated and lied to before and government promises down the road are probably only empty promises. <br>  The Ontario Medical Association represents the province's 20 thousand doctors.<br>  The OMA negotiated long and hard for this deal. </i>
<hr>
<b>St. Pete's Riots</b><p>
A riot erupted in St. Petersburg, Florida after a black suspect was shot and killed by a white police officer... it happened during a traffic check... the officer says the suspect was going to run him down, but witnesses say the man was standing with his hands on the hood of the car when he was killed...<br>  Appeals for calm failed... and full scale riots erupted with cars and buildilngs set on fire...<br>  Firefighters couldn't get past rioters to douse the flames...<br>  Now the mayor is calling for a review of race relations in the city.

<b>Protest Update</b><p>
The chairman of Toronto's transit commission says commuters should expect delays and disruptions during the two days of protests against the Harris government in Toronto. Paul Christie says, despite an injunction granted today by the Ontario Labor Relations Board, he cannot guarantee there will be transit service at all. the injunction limits picketing at transit system facilities during the days of protest. 
<hr>
<b>Abbott Murder</b><p>
The peace and quiet in the sleepy community of Fergus, northwest of Guelph, has been shattered by a murder. The body of 40-year-old Patricia Abbott was discovered by co-workers yesterday when she failed to return to work after lunch. Police are not saying how she died. Fergus police chief Rod Freeman says as far as he knows it is the first homicide in the town's history. 
<hr>
<b>Meds - Warning</b><p>
Jean Chretien is giving himself a pat on the back. The prime minister says he's kept most of his red book promises from the 1993 election. But he frankly admits the Liberal government hasn't been able to deliver on some big-ticket items. But while the PM was doing that, the Canadian Medical Association was giving the Liberals a failing grade on health care funding. They say cuts to transfer payments have had a devastating effect on the system.
<hr>
<b>Jobs Survey</b><p>
The mouth piece of Canadian small business is blaming Ottawa for a lack of job creation.<br>  In a survey of 18-thousand businesses, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business found that payroll taxes such as unemployment insurance premiums are preventing the hiring.
<hr>
<b>Chretien - Redbook </b><p>
Prime minister Jean Chretien has given himself a report card and he gets a healthy passing grade.<br>  Chretien says in the three years since the last election his government has kept seventy eight per cent of its red book election promises ... that includes things like deficit cutting and a claim by the PM that unemployment has dropped...<br>  Other promises like the one to scrap the GST, he calls "works in progress".<br>   
<hr>
<b>Rabin - Israel</b><p>
Israel's prime minister is urging unity as the Jewish state mourns Yitzhak Rabin. Benjamin Netanyahu says the choice is to unite or fall apart. Rabin's family holds Netanyahu partly to blame for the climate that led to the murder. Israelis lit candles, wept and said prayers for Rabin today to mark the year since his assassination, according to the Hebrew calendar.
<hr>
<b>Simpson Trial</b><p>
The defence has told O.J. Simpson's civil trial that the former football star remained close to Nicole Brown Simpson after their break-up. Robert Baker told jurors today that Simpson was "her confidant, her friend, not her stalker." Baker started his opening statement after John Kelly wrapped up remarks for the plaintiffs in the wrongful death suit -- the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. He said Simpson had an "uncontrollable rage" toward his ex-wife and a volatile chain of events prompted him to kill her.

<b>G.M. Settles</b><p>
After marathon bargaining, negotiators for General Motors and the Canadian Auto Workers union today reached a tentative contract in their talks in Toronto.<br>   CAW president Buzz Hargrove calls it a "win-win" agreement while GM chief negotiator Dean Munger calls it a good deal.<br>   The agreement includes a pledge by GM to recognize limits on contracting out work and the sale of facilities.<br>   The union has agreed to let GM sell two parts plants in Windsor and Oshawa, affecting 35-hundred members.<br>   But Hargrove says the union has negotiated terms that protect the workers' wages and benefits.                 <br>     Ratification votes will be held tomorrow and some striking workers could be back on the job as early as tomorrow night.
<hr>
<b>Days of Action</b><p>
Labor groups are vowing to shut down Toronto on Friday in a protest against the Harris government.<br>  Today the first rally marking the beginning of "the Days of Action" got under way.<br>  Meanwhile lawyers for the Toronto Transit Commission and Pearson Internatinal Airport are in court trying to get injunctions to keep both facilities from being closed down by picketers on Friday.
<hr>
<b>Days Action Follow</b><p>
Not everyone is concerned about how Friday's massive protest will affect business in Toronto.<br>   A survey shows downtown Toronto hotels are booked solid for Thursday night.<br>  And the rooms have not gone cheap.<br>   The average single occupancy for a room is more than 120 dollars.<br>   That same room today can be had for just 78 dollars.<br>   Many restaurant owners in downtown Toronto also expect to cash in during the labor protest.
<hr>
<b>Kitchener Crash</b><p>
Waterloo region police say it's a miracle that five teens survived the crash of a van being driven by a 13-year-old Toronto boy.<br>   The stolen van swerved off a Kitchener street around one o'clock this morning and smashed into a tree.<br>  Three of the people in the car were from Etobicoke, two from Kitchener.<br>  All suffered injuries.<br>   Police say the speedometer on the van was frozen at 93 kilometres an hour.
<hr>
<b>OPP Blitz</b><p>
Provincial police in the greater Toronto area are launching a crackdown on people who drive without insurance.<br>   And they're getting some corporate help.<br>   Cantel is providing officers with free cellular service so they can call insurance companies to check whether a drivers' policy is valid.<br>   The Insurance Bureau of Canada is having its member companies field the calls.               <br>     The blitz, which begins November 1st coincides with an increase in fines for driving without insurance, from a minimum of 500 dollars to a minimum of five-thousand dollars.
<hr>
<b>California Fires</b><p>
Firefighters in southern California have their hands full as they battle wind-driven wildfires.<br>   The latest count has about 100 homes damaged or destroyed by the fires.<br>   Thousands of hectares have gone up in smoke.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Godfrey Milliken</b><p>
Two Liberal MP's have introduced legislation in the commons to spoof the U.S. Helms Burton Act.<br>   That's an American law aimed at punishing foreigners, including Canadians, who profit from the property American investors lost in the Cuban revolution.<br>   John Godfrey and Peter Milliken say the same punishment should apply for the U.S. revolution when Canadian ancestors lost their property.
<hr>
<b>Flu Season</b><p>
Along with the changing of the seasons comes another kind of season... flu season.<br>  The Lung Association is encouraging people to get a flu shot.<br>  Some people are more at risk than others.

<i> <br>  The 26 thousand striking auto workers were receiving mixed messages all day.<br>  News reports from Toronto this morning said a deal has been struck on the critical issue of outsourcing.<br>  Phone calls to members of the master bargaining team said hold on ...<br>  Then this afternoon at 3:30 CAW leader Buzz Hargrove said no deal yet.. <br>  But members of the strike committee in St. Catharines have been summoned to Toronto tomorrow.  <br>  They want to learn the details on the critical issue of outsourcing.<br>  They want all other smaller issues resolved. <br>  Workers on the picket line aren't elated yet.<br>  They want to know what they're going to have to give up to ensure their jobs are here for at least another three years.<br>  Despite the fact that their leader Buzz Hargrove is optimistic about a deal, the membership wants to see it first.<br>  </i>

<hr>
<b>Physcians Update</b><p>
Pediatricians in Niagara are the latest group to add their voice to the chorus of agitated Ontario doctors.<br> The pediatricians are talking about withdrawing services from area hospitals, unless the government drops its demand to reduce doctors pay.<br>  Also in southwestern Ontario the Coalition of Family Physicians of Ontario is urging family doctors to refer patients only to specialists who support their job action.<br>  Lauran Sabourin has more in this report.
<i><br>  Physicians in Niagara are developing a reputation of being among the most militant in the province.<br>  First it was the obstetricians who  are refusing to take new patients.<br>  Then the orthopedic surgeons refusing to treat emergency cases.<br>  Now it's the area pediatricians who are talking about withdrawing their services from area hospitals.<br> Talk that makes hospital administrators nervous. <br>  What will the hospitals do.<br>  Provisions can be made to rush kids to Buffalo or Hamilton.<br>  But when you're dealing with an injured child that plan doesn't seem workable.<br>  Still the pediatricians feel job action may be the only way to make the government listen.<br>  The government's position is that it has to reduce health costs.<br>  Fee clawbacks and other monetary cutbacks are necessary.<br>  An arugment the peditricians don't buy especailly when they hear reports that arrangements have been made to deliver some babies at hospitals in Detroit.<br>  At fees running into the thousands. </i>
<hr>
<b>Tobacco - Cancer</b><p>
For years, tobacco companies have been saying there is no scientific proof to link cigarettes to lung cancer. Now there is. Scientists have now established a direct link between the "tar" in cigarette tobacco; and the development of cancerous cells in lung tissue. The results of the study are reported in the latest issue of the journal, "Science".
<hr>
<b>Protest - Roundup</b><p>
The battle of Toronto, is turning into a rough, and bloody affair.<br>  Protest organizers for next Friday's days of protest rally in Toronto ... say they may have to drop a promise not to interfere with the prestigious "Breeders Cup" horse race at Woodbine Race Track, next Saturday.<br>  Ontario Federation of Labour president Gord Wilson says; protestors may be forced to disrupt the race; because the federal government has gone to court; seeking an injunction that would prevent pickets from shutting down pearson airport.<br>  that's not the only injunction the courts have to consider; the TTC is also seeking relief from protest pickets.<br>   They want an injunction to keep protestors from blocking access to the system, during the two day labour demonstration.
<hr>
<b>Rae - Book </b><p>
On September 6th, 1990 Bob Rae and the New Democratic Party of Ontario celebrated one of the most stunning election victories in provincial history.<br>  Five turbulent years later, Rae's New Democrats went down to defeat as Mike Harris's Tories swept to power.<br>  Mr. Rae has since left the political arena and is now a partner at the Canadian international law firm of Goodman, Phillips and Vineberg.<br>  He has documented his political career in a new book entitled "From Protest to Power ... Personal Reflections on a Life in Politics."<br>  
<hr>
<b>Children - Survey</b><p>
 Ward and June Cleaver may be alive and well, and living in Canada. The fictional TV family of the 60's sitcom Leave it to Beaver... may have more in common with modern Canadian families, than you might think. That; according to Statistics Canada. A new, landmark survey of children in this country by Statscan, reveals that the vast majority under the age of 12: ... live in a two-parent family. Most, with their biological parents. The most obvious difference between modern families, and the Cleavers ....for 36 percent of the two-parent families in this country; mom is at work, and not in the kitchen. And despite that extra effort to earn money for the family ... 28 percent of children in this country live in families with incomes below the poverty line.
<hr>
<b>Guelph Flood</b><p>
Two investigations are underway in Guelph today, after vandals broke into a control room at a dam on the Speed River, and opened one of five flood gates. The breech sent water levels soaring to ten times their normal rates of flow ... and caused widespread flooding and minor damage, along the banks of the river. The OPP are looking into who was responsible. The regional conservation authority is investigating how the vandals managed to by-pass security, and activate the gate.
<hr>
<b>BC Storm</b><p>
Meanwhile, on the west coast, cleanup efforts are underway in British Columbia following the worst storm in more than three decades. Environment Canada called the storm, "a marine bomb"... and said at times, windspeeds reached hurricane force. More than 30 milimeters of rain fell on southern BC.  Hardest hit was Vancouver Island where more than 17-thousand homes .... most in the Victoria area... are still without power. At least one traffic death is blamed on the storm; and damage to boats and pleasure craft in the area, will run into the millions.
<hr>
<b>Car - Restaurant</b><p>
Three women were injured in Toronto this afternoon ... when a car smashed through the window of a restaurant in the Yonge, and Lawrence area ...and travelled the length of the eatery, before coming to a halt against a wall. One of the injured women was pinned beneath the vehicle. She was taken to hospital; but her condition is not known at this time. Police are still investigating the cause of the accident.

<b>Reform Announcement</b><p>
Reform Party leader Preston Manning is offering Canadians lower taxes and more spending on social programs.<br>  The party unveiled a six point campaign platform in London Ontario today, designed to win back mainstream support.<br>   Reform promises to maintain or increase spending on health and social programs, while at the same time cutting taxes. 
<hr>
<b>G.M. - St. Kitts</b><p>
The head of the Canadian Auto Workers union says he hopes there's a deal to end the GM Canada strike by Monday.<br>   Until yesterday, there was little optimism for a quick end to the two-week strike by 26-thousand workers.<br> But , the break came during a meeting with General Motors chair, Jack Smith.
<hr>
<b>Labor Ruling</b><p>
An Ontario Labor Relations Board ruling could set a legal precedent for next week's planned labor demonstration in Toronto.<br>   The ruling, says the walkout by General Motors employees during last December's Labor Day of Protest in London, was illegal.<br>   But the head of the Ontario Federation of Labor says he'll ignore the ruling.<br>   Gord Wilson says the board is becoming more controlled by the province and he considers it "biased."
<hr>
<b>Peres </b><p>
He is an eternal optimist for peace in the middle east ...and last night, former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres was in Hamilton.<br>  Peres shared his dreams for peace before an audience of close to 800 people.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Russia Coup</b><p>
Russian president Boris Yeltsin has dismissed his security chief, Alexander Lebed. He announced the news on national television. The decision comes one day after Russia's interior minister accused the ambitious Lebed of building his own rogue army in an attempt to seize power. A scowling Yeltsin told the TV audience the behavior of the controversial former general was damaging to the country. The move comes after weeks of bitter feuding between Lebed and other senior members of the government that culminated in charges this week that the former general was plotting a coup.
<hr>
<b>Hurricane Lili</b><p>
Forecasters now say they're "cautiously optimistic" that hurricane "Lili" will miss the United States. The storm's outer fringes are already dumping rain in Cuba and the Florida Keys. But the National Hurricane Centre in Miami says the system should make a sharp turn to the east. If the computers projections are right that would keep "Lili's" worst winds offshore. On the other hand, even a tiny error in those projections could spell trouble for Florida -- so the experts are urging residents to stay tuned. Some residents have already started stocking up on supplies just in case.

<b>GM Sit In</b><p>
Striking autworkers have ended their sit-in at the General Motors fabrication plant in Oshawa.<br>   They had occupied the building to stop the company from removing dies it says would be used in the production of auto components for a non-GM customer.                 <br>   GM agreed to stop efforts to obtain an injunction to remove the equipment -- if the striking workers left the building.<br>   The truce is to last until noon on Monday.
<hr>
<b>Breast Screening</b><p>
The Tory government says its decision to boost funding for breast cancer screening will save thousands of lives.<br>   Premier Mike Harris says the province will spend 24.3-million dollars over the next four years to create about 30 new mamogram screening sites over the next four years.<br>   Harris and health minister Jim Wilson say that means about four times the number of women who can now be screened will have the service available.
<hr>
<b>Post Secondary Panel</b><p>
Meanwhile, coping with less is an issue colleges and universities are trying to deal with.<br>  A provincial panel is touring Ontario seeking answers to the problem and today they came to Hamilton.<br>  The panel heard that Ontario's colleges and universities can learn a lesson from the health care system.<br>  Dwight Ryan has the story.
<i><br>  The advisory panel on post secondary education is travelling the province looking for answers.<br>  How is Ontario's post secondary education system going to remain effective and competitive with fewer government dollars.<br>  In Hamilton, a myriad of answers from college and university executives coping with less.<br>  Mohawk College president Keith Macintyre told panel members that 25 percent of total educational costs should be paid by the student.<br>  As well, second degrees or post graduate studies should not receive any government funding.  That money should be diverted to undergraduate studies in universities and colleges, thus giving more young people a chance.   <br>  He believes its the wave of the future.   <br>       McMaster president Dr. Peter George believes amalgamation makes some sense ...sometimes.<br>  First, he says, the government must remove barriers to cooperation and provide funding for the transition.   <br>    Amalgamation is just one issue the advisory panel will mull over before making a final report to education minister John Snobelen by December 15th.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Chretien</b><p>
Canadians are being told that social programs should come before tax cuts.<br>   Prime Minister Jean Chretien says once Canada's deficit is eliminated, he'd rather sink tax dollars into new social programs than return them to taxpayers.<br>   Chretien told the party faithful in Toronto last night that Liberal policies are kick-starting the economy by permitting low interest rates.         <br>  The prime minister also took shots at the Reform Party's call for tax relief and job creation.<br>   Preparing for an election, Preston Manning is expected to reveal his economic platform tomorrow while on a tour of Ontario.
<hr>
<b>Britain Gun Ban</b><p>
Britain's government has some strict new gun laws.<br>   All but the smallest calibre handguns are being outlawed.<br>   In addition, 22-calibre and smaller handguns must be stored at licensed gun clubs.<br>   The crackdown was prompted by the massacre last March in Dunblane, Scotland.<br>   A madman who had a licence for four handguns killed 16 children, a teacher and then himself.<br> 
<hr>
<b>Hitler Painting</b><p>
Jewish groups in Britain are calling the auction of Nazi memorabilia in Lincolnshire offensive.<br>  One of the lots is a water colour, apparently painted by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler when he was a student.<br>  The painting, which military experts claim is genuine, has attracted widespread interest and controversy.
<hr>
<b>Jagger Divorce</b><p>
Jerry Hall can't get any satisfaction from Rolling Stones' lead singer Mick Jagger, so she wants a divorce.<br>  Britain's "Sun" tabloid says the 40-year-old model is furious over reports Jagger had two recent liaisons in Los Angeles -- one with actress Uma Thurman and another with a Czech model.<br>  Jagger and Hall have been married for six years, but have lived together for nearly 20 and have three children.

<b>GM Strike U.S.</b><p>
The GM Canada strike has now forced the layoff of 10-thousand General Motors workers in the U.S. and Mexico.<br>   As talks to end the strike resumed in Toronto today, Canadian Auto Workers president Buzz Hargrove said he was optimistic a deal could be hammered out this week.<br>   GM, in the meantime, reports third-quarter profits of 1.27 billion dollars -- up nearly 100 per cent from last year.<br>   The union is likely to use that to argue GM can afford the CAW's job security demands. 
<hr>
<b>Auditor's Report</b><p>
Whether you're on welfare or have a seat in the corporate boardroom... it's still too easy to cheat the government. That's the finding of provincial auditor Erik Peters. His annual report says the government isn't doing enough to weed out tax and welfare cheaters. But he's also critical to the government's record in enforcing environmental standards, especially air quality. 
<hr>

<b>Somalia Book</b><p>
Accusations of waste, neglect and abuse in Canada's military.<br>  A new book on Canada's Armed Forces says soldiers in the field are suffering for the bad decisions of bureaucrats.<br>  "Tarnished Brass" says national defence has wasted more than 4 billion dollars while denying troops the equipment they need.<br>  It's author also has some advice for the military's new chief.

<b>Hussein Jericho</b><p>
Palestinian president Yasser Arafat says he's ready to have U.S. troops guard Jewish settlers in the west bank town of Hebron, if that will help calm Israel's security fears.<br>  Arafat was speaking to the media during a news conference today with Jordan's King Hussein.<br>  Hussein flew to the west bank on Tuesday to meet with the Palestinian leader.<br>  This is his first visit to the region since Israel captured the territory in 1967.<br>  King Hussein told the media that he will do anything he can to help with the peace process in the region.
<hr>
<b>Pope Home</b><p>
Doctors removed stitches from Pope John Paul today and gave him the green light to return to the Vatican a week after his appendix removed.<br>   Before leaving hospital, the pontiff bid farewell to young patients on the floor.<br>   Doctors said they hope the 76-year-old Pope takes it easy as he recuperates.<br>  He resumed work from his hospital bed, days after the operation last week.

<hr>
<b>GM</b><p>
Not much to be giving thanks for today....if you work for General Motors.<br> Negotiations aimed at ending the strike at GM Canada are to resume tomorrow but substantial progress is not expected. More than 26-thousand union members have shut down GM's Canadian operations to back their demand that the automaker limit the practice of contracting out jobs. The number of General Motors employees on layoff south of the border continues to grown as well, almost 43-hundred are affected, because plants either can't get parts from Canada, or can't ship their parts to Canada. In Oshawa today those on the picket line are digging in for what they feel could be a long dispute.     
<hr>
<b>Moms - Support</b><p>
There are a lot of frustrated single mothers who are still waiting for familty support payments. They are the ones who have little to be thankful for today as they try to make ends meet while trying to keep their children sheltered, clothed and fed.<br>  Jamie West has the story of one woman who's up to her neck in red tape...
<i><br>  Agnes Scheer hasn't received a family support payment since August. The now unemployed collections clerk, has a son to support and is worried about making ends meet. <BR>Specifically the family support plan...several offices including Hamilton were closed this spring as part of a money saving centralization plan.<br>  Now eventhough Anthony's father pay's support faithfully, a number of beaureaucratic errors have forced Agnes to create a paper trail of documents trying to recover what's rightfully hers ...<br>  No cheque ever arrived...and the frustation is building...<br>  The closest thing to an explanation is a letter from the government apologizing for the errors, and an appeal for understanding during the re-adjustment of staff working for the family support plan.<br>  At last word Agnes has been promised the 15-hundred dollars owed within the next two days.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Unity Rally</b><p>
A lawyer for a group of Ottawa-area residents says Quebec has no right to charge people who live outside the province.<br> The charges relate to last year's huge unity rally in Montreal before the October referendum.<br> Marc-andre Fabien will ask a Montreal court tomorrow to throw out the charges against 17 people, companies and groups from both inside and outside the province.<br> They're accused of illegal spending under Quebec's Referendum Act.
<hr>
<b>Hydro Sale</b><p>
The Harris government appears to be putting any sale of Ontario Hydro on the backburner.<br> Energy minister Norm Sterling says any action is two to four years away, suggesting a sale wouldn't take place before the next election.<br> Ontario Hydro is the largest electric utility in North America, with 43-billion dollars in assets, but it also carries huge debts.<br> Investment bankers and a provincial commission have urged the government to sell off some assets but public support for that is lukewarm at best.
<hr>
<b>Morin Inquiry</b><p>
January 27th is the tentative start date for the public inquiry into Guy Paul Morin's wrongful murder conviction.<br> That was the date discussed by lawyers at a closed-door meeting last week.<br> Sources say that a number of legal issues are already brewing. They include whether inquiry commissioner Fred Kaufman should warn parties at the start of the probe that findings of misconduct might be made against them.<br> Morin was convicted in 1992 of the first-degree murder of his next-door neighbor, nine-year-old Christine Jessop of Queensville.<br> He was acquitted last year because of DNA evidence.
<hr>
<b>Manning - Ontario</b><p>
Preston Manning is calling it a fresh start.<br> But some believe his four-day tour of voter and riding-rich southern Ontario this week could help decide whether there is any future for the Reform Party as a national political force.<br> Manning's fresh start campaign opens tomorrow in Newmarket, just north of Toronto.<br> His goal is to outline an election plan that will persuade voters there's more to reform than a right-wing party opposed to gun control and gay rights.<br> Manning will announce an economic program that includes plans to eliminate the deficit, slash taxes and create jobs, all while maintaining spending on social programs.
<hr>
<b>Year 2000 Bug</b><p>
It seems its a condition that everyone just forgot about. Computer use in the last few years has grown from simple games to a device that plays a major role in every facet of our lives. The condition everyone forgot about is the date, and come the year two thousand...plus one second, your computer could face a near fatal bug. A bug they are calling the year 2000 bug.

<b>School Bds. Nixed</b><p>
An education ministry spokesperson denies that the Harris government is on the verge of scrapping all school boards in the province, and replacing them with regional councils.<br>   Such a move could save the government one billion dollars in education costs.<br>   
<hr>
<b>GM Robinson</b><p>
Striking General Motors workers got some support today from a prominent New Democrat.<br>   MP Svend Robinson walked the picket line outside a GM plant in St. Catharines, Ontario.<br>   Negotiations to end the strike are pretty much on hold over the Thanksgiving weekend, with only top negotiators standing by in case of a change in position.<br>   A report by a U.S. newspaper says GM stockpiled parts in American plants to prevent the Canadian strike from quickly idling many U.S. operations.
<hr>
<b>Toronto Hash</b><p>
A twelve year old Toronto girl has been arrested and charged with trafficking .... after police seized more than 100 grams of hashish: part of a missing brick of hash that was cut up and distributed to Toronto school kids.<br>  Police say the girl had made elaborate plans to distribute the cache of hash, and cover her tracks, while cashing in, on the sale of the drug.
<hr>
<b>Victims' Services</b><p>
The Ontario government wants to right  the wrongs that have been perpetrated by the justice system against crime victims.<br>  Attorney general Charles Harnick acknowledged today that crime victims are often treated shabbily by the system.<br>  And the government is taking the first step toward treating crime victims fairly.
<hr>
<b>House of Horror</b><p>

<hr>
<b>Nobel Peace Prize</b><p>
In Oslo this morning...the Nobel Committee awarded the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize to two "resistance movement" leaders from east Timor ...a former Portuguese colony ...annexed by Indonesia in 1975.<br>    The award of 1-point-twelve million dollars went to Bishop Carlos Bay-low and Jose Ramos-horta.<br>    
<hr>
<b>Vickery Obit</b><p>
Meanwhile, some sad and shocking news about another Nobel Prize winner.<br>   Three days after winning the Nobel Prize for economics, Canadian born economist William Vickery has died.<br>  Columbia University announced that the 82 year old professor of economics died behind the steering wheel of his car, this morning.

<b>Bowmanville Court</b><p>
A suspect in the abduction and sexual assault of a four-year-old girl kicked at reporters as he entered an Oshawa court house today.<br>   Police arrested the man yesterday after the girl was found in a garden shed several hours after she vanished from her home in Bowmanville.<br>  21 year-old Coulson Donald Woolner of no fixed address is charged with sexual assault, kidnapping, forcible confinement and breaking and entering.<br>   Woolner tried to cover his face with his clothing during the brief court appearance.
<hr>
<b>Education Cuts</b><p>
Parent groups across the province are mobilizing to protest the Harris governments cuts to education.<br>  They say the budget cuts are having a direct effect on their children's education.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Enviro Policy</b><p>
Ontario's environment commissioner has slammed the harris government for changing environmental regulations too fast and without enough public input.<br>  Eva Ligeti says she suports progressive environmental reform, but she says poor decisions are made when experts and the general public are excluded from the process. <br> Ligeti calls on the Harris government to give Ontarians more time, information and opportunity to comment on proposed changes to envirenmental laws.
<hr>
<b>Auto Insurance</b><p>
Car insurance in Ontario will be dramatically different starting three weeks from tomorrow.<br>  By now, your auto insurer has probably sent you some pamphlets outlining changes to the system.<br>   You'll probably pay less for car insurance under the new rules, but you'll also be getting less.<br>  The story tonight from Dwight Ryan.  
<i><br>  Dramatic changes are about to take place in Ontario's auto insurance industry.<br>  For two years, the industry has been working under the New Democrats' bill 164.   Rates didn't drop the way we thought they would...and we lost the right to sue in the event of an accident.<br>  But the Tories promised yet another revamp of auto insurance. And starting November 1st, it'll be here...bill 59.   <br>    But, for more money you can have more coverage.<br>  Hamilton insurance broker Russ McEdwards says most people buy their insurance on price alone.   <br>    As a broker, Russ McEdwards represents seven insurance companies.  Each will offer different options.  You have to make your own decision on what's best for you.   <br>      If your renewal date comes after November 1st, you'll get the old coverage at the new rate. And you could be in for a premium rebate.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Young Photo</b><p>
The military says strange things happen when people deal with death day-to-day.<br>  A Vancouver newspaper has obtained photographs showing Canadian soldiers posing with the corpse of an Iraqi killed by a mine at the end of the gulf war.<br>   Soldiers formerly based in Chilliwack, B.C. are shown posing in front of the corpse and body parts during their six-month U-N mine-sweeping mission.<br>   Military officials admit the photos come across as distasteful, but say the soldiers did "nothing illegal or rude" to the body.<br>   But defence minister Doug Young disagrees.
<hr>
<b>CBC Inquiry</b><p>
The federal government's commissioner of official languages says budget cuts to the CBC may isolate anglophone and francophone minorities across the country.<br>  That's why commissioner Victor Goldbloom is launching a formal investigation into the CBC cuts.           <br>  Goldbloom has written a letter to heritage minister Sheila Copps, asking her to reconsider the CBC budget cuts.<br>  He is also studying whether the cuts violate the spirit of the Official Languages Act.<br>  The act says Ottawa is obligated to support the vitality of official language minority communities.

<b>Corrupt Gambling</b><p>
Solicitor general Bob Runciman says he hasn't seen a police report warning of organized crime involvement in Ontario casinos and lotteries.<br>   Premier Mike Harris says he hasn't read it either.<br>   The report by the criminal intelligence service is so secret, the legislature's own justice committee was denied access to it earlier this year.<br>   It warns Ontario's multi- billion dollar gaming business is virtually unpoliced, and open to mob infiltration.<br>   
<hr>
<b>Education Changes</b><p>
Ontario education minister John Snobelen announced today that standardized report cards will be introduced in the province's schools as early as this November.<br>   Three different models of the standard report card will be field-tested in about 900-english and french language schools across Ontario in time for the first set of exams in November.<br>  According to the education minister, the new report cards will give parents more precise and consistant information on their children's progress in school. <br>  The education minister says the final report card for grades one through nine is to be introduced in all schools, for the 1997-98 school year.

If an Ontario Liberal MP gets his way, the big oil companies will have to give 30 days notice of gas price hikes.<br>  Dan McTeague's private members bill has passed two major hurdles in the house of commons.<br>  The bill would ammend the competition act to force oil companies to warn the government whenever they intend to raise gas prices by one percent or more.<br>  Industry minister John Manley says that would effectively end competiton in the retail gas industry.

<i><br>  It's actually an embarrasing situation. <br>  That's how McMaster University medical professor Doctor Doug Wilson describes the lack of formal undergraduate training in medical schools on addictions.<br>  Now a five year co-operative venture between Ontario's five medical schools and the Addiction Research Foundation will produce solid teaching strategies to help med students and faculty better understand alcohol and other drug problems.<br>  Dr. Wilson says millions of healthcare dollars could be saved...and lives if doctors treated the problem much more seriously...<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Smoke In Eyes</b><p>
Researchers have been searching for what causes one of the most common types of blindness that primarily strikes older people.<br>  A new study has some answers.<br>

<b>Boyle Resigns</b><p>
General Jean Boyle has resigned as the head of the military.<br>   Boyle sent his resignation letter to prime minister Chretien, who promptly accepted it.<br>   Both Boyle and David Collenette, who resigned as defence minister last Friday, were under fire for weeks over the Somalia affair.<br>   But the departing chief of the defence staff says his conscience is clear and the criticism that he has endured is unfounded.
<hr>
<b>Canada Oost</b><p>
Canada Post will no longer deliver unaddressed flyers in most communities.<br>   Diane Marleau, the minister in charge of the post office, has decided to end ad-mail deliveries by Canada Post, if there's a private company available to deliver it.<br>   The recommendation was part of a review of Canada Post.<br>   The review found that private companies had a point when they complained that Canada Post uses stamp revenue to undercut the competition in other delivery services.
<hr>
<b>Auto Talks</b><p>
The head of the Canadian Auto Workers says there's no way to stop the strike at GM Canada from expanding into its final phase.<br>   More than 20-thousand General Motors workers are on strike and Buzz Hargrove says another five-thousand CAW members will join them tomorrow at midnight.<br>   Hargrove says workers in London, Woodstock and Windsor, will join the strike, following the lead of workers in Oshawa and St. Catharines, and Ste. Therese Quebec.<br>   Meanwhile GM in the United States has begun closing some plants that supply parts to operations in Canada.<br>   However some industry watchers say GM anticipated the Canadian strike by stockpiling both parts and vehicles.
<hr>
<b>Harris - Libraries</b><p>
Premier Mike Harris says his government will take action against school boards that cut into classroom education.<br>  Harris made the statement after opposition MPPs claimed his government's spending cuts were responsible for the closure of some school libraries.

<b>Sweatshop Demo</b><p>
Ontario labor minister Elizabeth Witmer has promised a compete review of the province's employment standards act.<br>  The minister was taken to task in the legislature today for allowing sweatshops to operate in Ontario.<br>   
<hr>
<b>Diana</b><p>
It looks like that videotape that was said to show Princess Diana frolicking with her former riding instructor is bogus.<br>   The Sun newspaper published shots from the video but now says it was the victim of "one of the most elaborate hoaxes of the decade."<br>   The paper has apologized profusely to the Princess and riding instructor James Hewitt, with whom she had a five-year affair.<br>  The 80-second tape, also broadcast on Sky TV News, shows a woman looking very similar to diana stripping down to her sports briefs and bra, frolicking with a man who resembles Hewitt.

<b>GM - Tonawanda</b><p>
As we've been hearing all day, the strike at General Motors Canada is leading to more layoffs on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border.<br> A GM official says 800 workers will be laid off tonight at a transmission plant in Ypsilanti (ip'-sil-ant-ee), just outside Detroit. Earlier today, workers were sent home from a GM powertrain plant in Tonawanda, New York, near Buffalo. More than 20-thousand members of the Canadian Auto Workers are on strike at plants in St. Catharines and Oshawa, Ontario, and Saint Therese, Quebec. About 15-hundred workers at GM suppliers in the Toronto-area are now on layoff. That includes 500 employees of two trucking companies that haul parts, and more than 500 workers at Lear Corporation, which builds seats for GM cars. No progress was reported in contract talks this morning and as Lauran Sabourin reports the union is predicting this could be a long one.
<I><br>  Pickets are posted at all of the plant gates in the St. Catharines operations.<br>  Pickets who on day one of this labour dispute are promising that they can hold out on signing a contract one day longer than General Motors is willing to. <br>  The issue here is outsourcing. To the striking workers outsourcing means losing their jobs to workers from other factories who are willing to supply parts to GM for less.<br>  To GM outsourcing means remaining competitive.<br>  Less than a week into their strike and its already having an impact south of the border.<br>  At the GM Tonawanda engine plant, twelve hundred workers were laid off today.  And more layoff notices are expected within days.<br>  One engine line been shut down in Tonawanda.<br>  Another engine line is threatened with a shutdown.<br>   Still the U.S. GM workers are supportive of their striking counterparts in Canada. <br>  General Motors is negotiating the United Auto Workers in Detroit right now.  But a strike deadline has not be set. </I>
<hr>
<b>Defence Chief</b><p>
According to Canada's new defince minister Doug Young, Canada's military is in a major crisis that goes far deeper than its leadership. ``The armed forces and Canada is faced by a major crisis,'' Young told the commons after taking over the portfolio Friday from David Collenette, who resigned over a breach of government guidelines.<br> Young met embattled Gen. Jean Boyle earlier today to discuss restoring morale in a military disheartened by the Somalia affair. At the end of their meeting Boyle was still chief of defence staff, but Young has promised to lift the cloud hanging over the military, tainted by the regiment's controversial mission to Somalia in 1992-1993.         
<hr>
<b>Bourassa</b><p>
Quebecers said a last goodbye today to ex-premier Robert Bourassa, filling Notre Dame Basilica for a state funeral that drew everyone from political prominents to ordinary citizens.<br> Thousands of people who couldn't get into the crowded basilica listened to the service outside.<br> Bourassa, who was premier for a total of 14 years, died in hospital of cancer last Wednesday at the age of 63.<br> The mourners in the basilica included prime minister Jean Chretien, Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard, conservative leader Jean Charest and ex-Quebec premier Jacques Parizeau.<br> Several other premiers also attended.<br> Prior to the funeral service, Bourassa's body lay for two days in a closed coffin in the ornate red room of the legislature in Quebec City.<br> Police estimated more than 10,000 people filed past the coffin on Saturday and Sunday.<br> Bourassa's widow, daughter Michele and son shook hands with the stream of mourners.
<hr>
<b>Spanking</b><p>
To spank or not to spank, that is the on-going question.<br> The latest answer delivered by the Canadian Pediatric Society is a firm "no"... literally.<br> The group of doctors says firm reprimands and time-outs are much more effective.<br> As Jamie West reports tonight ...there are clearly two schools of thought on the issue.
<i><br>  Spanking... even short open handed taps on the bottom could lead to more serious behavioural and self esteem problems down the road.<br>  That's the message from the Canadian Pediatric Society in Ottawa. <BR>The message isn't really new, but over the last decade has led to the abolision of corporal punishment in many school boards including the Hamilton Public and Separate boards.  <BR>This privately run school in Copetown features kindergarten to grade 12 under one roof...<br>  Corporal punisment is doled out sparingly but according to god's word "withold not correction".<br>  Several warnings are issued long before the dreaded strap is used.<br>  The school says the strap sees daylight about twice a year and is an effective deterrent.<br>  But this family counsellor sides with pediatricians who want the rod thrown away to spare the child.<br>  And for parents who feel there are no other alternatives but to spank, Ricketts says take a time out yourself and pick up the phone.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>TTC Shutdown?</b><p>
Toronto's transit union has voted to join labor's day of protest later this month.<br> The Ontario Federation of Labor had been pushing for toronto's bus, streetcar and subway drivers to stop work on October 25th to protest Harris government cutbacks.<br> Labor's goal is to shut down the city.<br> Transit commission chairman David Gunn has made it clear there will be no disciplinary action against workers who take the day off.<br> But they will lose a day's pay.<br> With the TTC onside, the labor federation is now hoping that workers at GO Transit and Pearson International Airport will also join the protest.
<hr>
<b>Smoking By-law</b><p>
Some Toronto councillors are proposing a compromise today aimed at taking the edge off the city's tough new anti-smoking bylaw.<br> New regulations -- due to go into effect January 1st -- would place a smoking ban on all City of Toronto restaurants and bars.<br> Councillor Peter Tabuns wants his colleagues to reconsider the stringent measure.<br> He is suggesting they return to an earlier proposal for separate, glassed-in areas for smokers.<br> The compromise doesn't have the support of the Ontario Restaurant Association.<br> They say building separate, ventilated areas is not a realistic option for thier members.
<hr>
<b>Pope Surgery</b><p>
On the world stage today, Pope John Paul is said to be feeling well as he awaits surgery to have his appendix removed.<br> His surgeon says the Pontiff is in excellent spirits and is not worried about the operation.<br> Officials say he underwent a scan of his abdomen and two heart tests at a Rome hospital.<br> The Pope is 76 and has been plagued by recurring bouts of fever and illness.<br> The Vatican has strongly denied that something more serious than an inflamed appendix is to blame.  Before entering the hospital, the Pope conducted a special three hour ceremony, to send 16 catholics, down the final road to sainthood, and ended the mass by asking the faithful, to pray for his health.
<hr>
<b>Fergie - Book</b><p>
According to the British tabloids the Queen has apparently worked out a deal, that would bail her daughter in law out of debt... and get Sarah Ferguson out of her royal hair.<br>  Fergie, as she is popularly known, has caused little but shame and embarrasment to the royal family; and her lavish lifestyle has run far beyond her current means.<br> The offer from the Queen will apparently provide Fergie with enough millions to bail her out of debt ...but the price Fergie will pay in return; is custody of her children.

<b>G.M.</b><p>
15 thousand General Motors workers at operations in two cities in Ontario and Quebec are walking the picket lines tonight.<br>   And economists say the strike couldn't have happened at a worse time.<br>   Canada Trust chief economist Patti Croft warns that an auto strike will be a major drag on economic recovery.<br>   And it doesn't appear the strike -- which will spread to other operations next week if no deal is reached -- will be over quickly.<br>   The Canadian Auto Workers Union and GM are at odds over the issue of contracting out work.
<hr>
<b>Boat Sinking</b><p>
One person is dead and two others are missing after a boat with 11 people on board, capsized in the St. Lawrence River near Cornwall.<br>   American reports suggest the small open boat was being used last night to take illegal immigrants from Canada to the U.S.<br>   Nine people were pulled from the river, however a woman died later in hospital.<br>   A military helicopter is being used in the search along with a police boat and several private vessels.
<hr>
<b>Education Funding</b><p>
The Harris government is getting closer to deciding on a new way to finance education in Ontario. A special goverment committee is expected to give its recomendations on education financing next week. 
<hr>
<b>New Speaker</b><p>
Conservative maverick Chris Stockwell was elected the new speaker of Ontario's legislature Thursday.<br>   Stockwell, whose rowdy behavior in the house has often got him in trouble, won on the seventh ballot, beating out seven other candidates from all three parties.<br>   The post was vacated last week when Al McLean resigned in the midst of a sexual harassment controversy.<br>   The 39 year old Stockwell, was first elected in 1990, and denied a cabinet post after the Tories won the election last year.<br>   Since then, he has spoken out against his own government repeatedly.<br>  Most recently, he took exception when government house leader Dave Johnson suggested that McLean step down until the harassment charges against him were resolved.
<hr>
<b>Book Banning</b><p>
The St. Catharines library board is meeting at this hour to decide whether or not to ban another book on killer Paul Bernardo from their shelves.<br>  The book "Invisible Darkness" written by Stephen Williams is yet another graphic description of the assaults and murders of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy.<br>  As Lauran Sabourin reports the library board is finding itself in the position of being accused of censorship.
<br>  <I>It's a controversy the St. Catharines library board wishes it could avoid.<br>  Whether or not to buy copies of the hardcover book "Invisible Darkness" for the library system.<br>  Board chair Rick Dykstra personally is voting against aquiring the book.<br>  A book that he sees as something that re-opens old wounds.<br>  To Dykstra this is not a censorship issue.   As he sees it the board is rather acting as the conscience of the community.<br>  The St. Catharines libary board policy on books that detail the crimes of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka is not carved in stone.<br>  The library carries two other books on the pair.<br>  The libary has 12 copies of the paperback Deadly Innocence.<br>  Copies that are so popular with the public that one copy is kept in the special collections section and can't be signed out. </I><br>  
<hr>
<b>Grand River Deal</b><p>
The voices of the Six Nations Women Singers have ushered in a new relationship concerning land around the Grand River.<br>  14 parties, representing the federal and provincial governments, ten municipal governments and two native band councils, signed the Grand River Notification Agreement this morning.<br>  Under the deal, any one of the parties is obligated to notify the others immediately of land use proposals.<br>  The agreement isn't legally binding, but is seen as an important first step in establishling goodwill and cooperation between those involved.
<hr>
<b>Recycle</b><p>
While the profits of recycling have dwindled of late, a prominent U.S. environmentalist says it still good value over the long term.<br>  Delegates to a Hamilton conference on recycling heard today that while the practise of recycling is under heavy criticism.. its still worthwhile.<br>  Dwight Ryan has that story.
<i><br>  Reduce, reuse and recycle were the key words just a decade ago.<br>  Critics said we wouldn't do it, but we did.<br>  We took our newspapers, winebottles, and cans and separated them from our garbage.<br>  The market was hot for the recycled goods and some people were making a lot of money.<br>  But delagates to this Hamilton conference heard there was still a long way to go.  <br>  The Washington based environmentalist says recycled goods must be treated as a commodity.<br>  When commodity prices go down, investors should look at their long-term value.   <br>    While the debate rages on over the value of recylcing, it still takes a hundred years for a tin can to decompose and up to a thousand years for a glass bottle.<br></i>

<b>GM - CAW</b><p>
The hours are ticking by toward a midnight strike deadline for thousands of General Motors workers.<br>   Negotiators for GM and the Canadian Auto Workers are searching for common ground at a downtown Toronto hotel.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Bourassa </b><p>
The man who took on Quebec separatists and won a number of battles against them died today.<br>  Former Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa was 63.<br>  He finally succumbed to the skin cancer he had been battling for years.<br>  And as Anthony Pooley reports tonight... tributes have been pouring in all day long.
<i><br>  Robert Bourassa believed passionately in Quebec's role within Canada... while at the same time agreeing that his beloved province... the North American habitat of french culture and language... had been short- changed. He sought to strengthen Quebec's position within the Canadian federation... and depending upon one's point of view... he either succeeded or failed.<br>  After losing Quebec to Rene Levesque's separatists in 1976... Bourassa left politics. But a few year's later, he engineered the big daddy of political comebacks... and by 1985, he was Premier of Quebec once more. He played a major role in drafting the Meech Lake Accord... and bet the farm that the constitutional ammendment would galvanize Quebec's enhanced place within Canada. But as history records ... what he thought was the favourite turned out to be a longshot... and the accord was never ratified.<br>  Bourassa had three different battles with skin cancer... the last of which claimed his life today. Tributes have been pouring in. <br>  Bourassa will be remebered, among other things, as the father of James Bay... the huge power project that harnessed northern Quebec's massive hydroelectric resources.<br>  Former Quebec Liberal Premier Robert Bourassa ... dead at 63. </i>
<hr>
<b>Child Support</b><p>
Deadbeat parents could have their driver's licences yanked under legislation introduced today in Ontario.<br>   The announcement comes as the Conservative government faces persistent criticism over cuts to the office devoted to enforcing support payment orders.<br>   Close to one-billion dollars of those payments are in arrears.<br> 
<hr>
<b>Gay Spouse Benefits</b><p>
Ontario's municipalities are going to have to pay spousal benefits to employees involved in same-sex relationships.<br>  That ruling came from the Ontario Human Rights Commission this week.<br>  And gay rights activists are celebrating the decision.
<hr>
<b>Middleton Tragedy</b><p>
A quiet suburban Toronto neighborhood has been shocked by the death of an elderly resident.<br>  A 78 year old women died after she and her husband tumbled down their stairs.<br>  The couple wasn't found until days later.
<hr>
<b>Mid East Peace</b><p>
Briefly in international news tonight,<br>     U.S. president Clinton says Israeli and Palestinian leaders failed to settle their explosive differences during a two-day summit in Washington.<br>   But he says the two sides will step up peace talks beginning Sunday with an American mediator.<br>   Clinton acknowledged the summit outcome fell short of his hopes -- but says things are in better shape than two days ago.
<hr>
<b>Octuplets</b><p>
A 32-year-old British woman who had been trying against medical advice to give birth to eight babies, lost the last four fetuses today.<br>  King's College Hospital in London made the announcement this afternoon.<br>   Mandy Allwood prematurely gave birth to three boys on Monday -- and a girl this morning.<br>    All have died.<br>  She conceived the eight fetuses after taking fertility drugs.

<b>Earthroots - Court</b><p>
A bid to stop the logging of old-growth forests in Ontario's Temagami region has failed.<br>   A Toronto judge ruled against a temporary injunction being sought by the environmental group Earthroots. The conservationists argued that the provincial government is violating its own forestry practices code by allowing logging in the area.<br>   They say they fear that all the trees may be gone by the time the civil trial goes ahead.
<hr>
<b>Local Redistribution</b><p>
The Harris government introduced legislation today to cut the number of provincial politicians from 130 to 103, going into the next Ontario election. <br>  Bob Ireland has the story.<BR>
<i>       It was against the background of this graphic demonstation, that  Premier Mike Harris announced that legislation would be introduced in the legislature today, cutting the number of provincial ridings from 130 to 103. In the next provincial election, Ontario electoral boundaries will match the federal boundaries. Premier Harris says he is fulfilling an election campaign promise to cut the cost of government. And he says it must start at the top.<br>  Harris says cuting 27 MPPs positions with all their expenses, could amount to direct savings of around 13-million dollars. While the Peel Region will gain one seat, the regions of Niagara, Halton and Hamilton Wentworth will lose one riding each. Premier Harris says he expects to get support from both the Liberals and the NDP, for the re-drafting of electoral boundaries.<br>  Christopherson says many ontario voters will be angry that they will not have a say in how their ridings are carved up. <br>  The new riding boundaries will be in place in time for the next provincial election, expected in 1998 or 1999. </i>

<hr>
<b>Guns - Cost</b><p>
The cost of gun control is cheaper than the cost of gun deaths and injuries in Canada, says a group of doctors.<br>  Over six billion dollars is spent per year on gun injuries, according to a study published last year.<br>  And pediatrician, Doctor Katherine Leonard says there are other costs as well.
<hr>
<b>Mideast Peace</b><p>
Good news out of Washington on the Israeli- Palestinian talks.<br>   Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian chairman Yassar Arafat are talking... and while that is seen as a positive sign.. there is no word as to whether the dialogue will result in the two resolving thier many differences.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Octuplets</b><p>
In Britain...a woman who has been carrying eight babies has lost some of them.<br>   The woman's million-dollar pay-per-baby deal with a tabloid newspaper, provoked controversy earlier this summer.<br>

<b>GM Latest</b><p>
The head of the Canadian Auto Workers will be holding a news conference any moment now to update the media on how talks with General Motors are going... and whether or not the union will walk away from the table... <BR>Earlier today... Buzz Hargrove said that General Motors had moved forward on some issues at contract talks in Toronto. But Hargrove says there has been no progress on the key concern of contracting out. GM says it needs to outsource more work to get to a similar level as Ford and Chrysler. Hargrove says that argument may work in the U.S., but not in Canada, where GM has contracted out more jobs than its competitors.<br>  
<hr>
<b>High Park Rapist</b><p>
A Toronto prosecutor calls a convicted serial rapist &quot;the embodiment of a contemporary urban nightmare.&quot;  Thirty-five-year- old Michael Giroux was sentenced today to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to 40 charges, including five sexual assaults. Three attacks occurred in Barrie and two in the High Park area in Toronto's west end. Giroux was dubbed the "high park rapist." The court was told that Giroux "preyed" on young women and planned his attacks meticulously.
<hr>
<b>Minister Acquitted</b><p>
A Dunnville minister has been acquitted on seven counts of sexual assault. 44-year-old reverend Ian Wills had been accused of the assaults on the same woman in 1993 and '94. He was charged in May 1995. Last Friday, a jury decided that the pastor of Dunnville's Word of Faith Church was not guilty.
<hr>
<b>Baby Update</b><p>
B.C.'s health minister has ordered a review of security at all hospitals in the province after a newborn was abducted in Kelowna last week. The child was found safe in the woods about 10 hours after Friday's kidnapping. A woman and two teenagers are charged and appeared in court today.
<hr>
<b>McLean Speaker</b><p>
Former legislative speaker Al McLean says he will continue to represent his constituents in Simcoe East. The Tory MPP says he is determined to continue his political career even though he resigned as speaker last week. He had been under pressure from the opposition to step down over allegations he sexually harassed a former employee. McLean denies the allegations by Sandi Thompson.
<hr>
<b>Workfare</b><p>
 Ontario Liberals are calling for the government's workfare program to be scrapped, and are demanding the minister responsible for welfare be fired. 
<hr>
<b>Runciman - OPP</b><p>
 Beginning tomorrow, every OPP officer working during the rush hours in the greater Toronto area will patrol the 400 series highways.  The patrolling blitz named &quot;All Hands on Deck&quot;, is an extension of the Highway Ranger program that started last August. Tomorrow during the rush hour..there will be 31 extra OPP cruisers checking for bad drivers on highways 400, 401 and 403. Solicitor General Bob Runciman denies opposition charges that it will be taking police officers away from other crime duties. <br>

<b>GM-C.A.W.</b><p>
Just days before a contract deadline, General Motors appears to be heading towards a strike with its union.<br>   A letter by the president of GM to employees, warning of the need to contract out jobs, has sparked a furor among GM workers.<br>  The Canadian Autoworkers Union may walk away from the bargaining table this week-end.
<hr>
<b>Mahaffy - Rock</b><p>
Debbie Mahaffy, the mother of slain teenager Leslie Mahaffy, is going to deliver a message to the federal justice minister that will be difficult for him to ignore.<br>   Since Leslie was killed by Paul Bernardo five years ago, Debbie Mahaffy has been fighting to keep killers behind bars... for life.<br>  And Mahaffy believes that talking to the justice minister is just like talking to a rock.
<hr>
<b>RCMP Women</b><p>
A staggering number of female RCMP officers say they have been sexually harrassed on the job.  In fact, more than half said so in an internal inquiry conducted in 1993.<br>  Since 1994, RCMP employees have had mandatory harrassment training courses. So far eight thousand have taken them.<br>  Sargaent Donna Brownlee says the numbers come as no surprise.  She adds a number of assistance programs are available for women who need them.  <br>  Sgt. Brownless advises women who have been harrassed not to leave the force.
<hr>
<b>Bhaduria Suit</b><p>
Independent MP Jag Bhaduria has launched a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the Toronto Board of Eduction.<br>   The board fired Bhaduria in 1990 because of threatening letters he sent to board officials.<br>   At that time the Markham MP, who was a teacher, was angry because he was not promoted to vice-principal.
<hr>
<b>Israel Update</b><p>
Palestinians and Israelis are still exchanging gunfire in their worst clashes in decades.<br>   Sources close to Yasser Arafat say he has ordered police to stop any attacks on Israelis, but the fighting continues.<br>   In one of today's fiercest battles, Israeli helicopter gunships fired at Palestinian gunmen in the southern Gaza Strip, and tanks surrounded the area.<br>   Scores of people have been killed in the fighting over the past four days.
<hr>
<b>Hope Diamond</b><p>
Legend has it the Hope Diamond was owned by kings and queens, caused premature deaths and beheadings and even carries a curse.<br>   But even a diamond with so much weighty history needs to be cleaned now and then.<br>  So the largest known blue diamond was escorted to New York under heavy security this week...for a bath.<br>

<hr>
<b>Legislature - McLean</b><p>
The NDP accused the Harris govenerment today of trying to put off until Thursday, a resolution calling for the firing of speaker Al McLean. Both the Liberals and the NDP wanted to deal with the matter today. 

<b>Opposition Q.P.</b><p>
Opposition members were quick to jump on the Al McLean issue when the house resumed.<br>  Although controversial, the common sense revolution still enjoys the support of a majority of voters.<br>  A new poll indicates the Tories are still in the lead amongst decided voters...even though the Liberals are narrowing the gap.<br>  Dwight Ryan reports that opposition members will have their hands full turning the tide.
<i>Members of the legislature weren't even in their seats when the McLean issue arose...  <br>  For opposition members fighting the Harris majority, the Al McLean issue is a gift.  Although the NDP motion to oust the speaker was defeated, it still gave the New Democrats and Liberals a chance to lambaste the Tories.<br>  After devastating defeats, both parties are trying to rejuvenate themselves.  The New Democrats have a new leader ..  His name is Howard Hampton and he didn't take long to show off who's in charge now.   <br>    The Liberals don't have a new leader yet, but they will in November.  Lyn Mcleod is moving aside after her party's humiliating defeat last year.<br>  Seven liberals, six MPPs and an Ottawa businessman,  are seeking the opposition leader's spot.  </i>
<hr>
<b>U.S. Canada Hearings</b><p>
 Tomorrow in Washington, a congressional sub-committee will hold a hearing into the potential impacts of Quebec's separation.<br>  A recent essay on the issue, that's been published world wide, is raising some serious questions about how a Canadian break-up would effect the United States.<br>  The essay and tomorrow's hearings, may help shed some light onto what Canadians could face in the future.
<hr>
<b>Clinton - U.N.</b><p>
U.S. president Clinton says he hopes a treaty he signed at the United Nations today will result in a "better, safer world."<br>   The global treaty bans nuclear test explosions, including underground blasts. Representatives of the world's other nuclear powers -- China, France, Russia and Britain -- followed Clinton in signing the document.<br>   A total of 65 countries will sign the treaty.<br>   Foreign affairs minister Lloyd Axworthy signed for Canada.
<hr>
<b>Yeltsin Health</b><p>
Russian president Boris Yeltsin insists he's not too sick to work.<br>   Doctors are concerned he might be too ill to undergo heart surgery.<br>   Russian television, shows Yeltsin smiling weakly and sitting slightly hunched in a chair as he chats with Russia's prime minister at the hospital.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Bernardo AIDS</b><p>
Paul Bernardo has been ordered to be tested for AIDS, and other sexually transmitted diseases.<br> A Toronto judge made the order yesterday at the request of a woman who was raped by Bernardo in the garage of a Scarborough apartment building in 1989.<br> The woman is suing for 10-million dollars.<br> Bernardo did not contest the order and was not represented at yesterday's hearing in Toronto.<br> The testing is to be performed within the next 45 days.
<hr>
<b>Carrey Marries</b><p>
Burlington born actor Jim Carrey and his girlfriend, actress Lauren Holly, have married.<br>   Carrey's spokeswoman says Carrey and Holly tied the knot in Los Angeles yesterday.<br>   It's the second marriage for both.<br>   The couple however, won't be heading off on a honeymoon.   Carrey has to be back on the set of his movie, "Liar, Liar" tomorrow.

<b>Al McLean - Sick Leave</b><p>
Ontario's embattled legislature speaker is taking sick leave.<br>   A source close to Al McLean confirms the speaker is taking an "undetermined amount of time" off because of problems with his diabetes.<br>   The Tory member of the legislature has been under pressure to step aside from the speaker's post, over allegations that he sexually harassed an employee.<br>   McLean has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.<br>   A report on the allegation is expected to be completed by the time the leislature resumes sitting on Tuesday.
<hr>
<b>Tories - Economy</b><p>
<br>  The allegations against the speaker will undoubtedly be on the minds of members when they resume sitting next week.<br>  But another area that is sure to dominate discussion... budget slashing.<br>  That topic was front and center today as the tories met in Vineland to plan their agenda.<br>  Lauran Sabourin reports.

<i><br>  Victoria Hall in Vineland was the setting for day long caucus session.<br>  The economy was the main item on the agenda.<br>  Harris promises more budget cutting. more public sector layoffs.<br>  The government says it's legislative priorities are improving the education, law enforcment and health care services.<br>  But the public is questioning where the improvements are in particular with health care when the government is talking about closing hospitals. <br>  The Harris government is preparing for clash with the province's teachers unions over education cutbacks.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Cop Beating Video</b><p>
A video tape, depicting the last minutes of a prisoner, being held at a Toronto police station, was released to the public today.<br>  The dramatic 30-minute tape, was shown to the jury at the trial of Const. Paul Van Seters.<br>  The 15 year police veteran is charged with criminal negligence causing death and criminal negligence causing bodily harm, in the death of Kenneth Allen.<br>  Allen died while in police custody in November 1991.<br>  Court has already heard testimony from witnesses who described Allen as violent and paranoid when he attacked a streetcar driver the night he died.
<hr>
<b>Violence Inquiry</b><p>
<br>   Ontario's coroner and child welfare groups are joining forces in a multi-pronged attempt to reduce child abuse deaths.<br>   It's a growing problem that officials admit, was treated too lightly in the past.
<hr>
<b>Chrysler Deal</b><p>
The Canadian Auto Workers Union will announce its next strike target next week.<br>   The union won job security in an eleventh-hour deal hammered out with Chrysler Canada last night.<br>   Chrysler has agreed to replace any job it contracts out with a similar job at one of its plants.<br>   It also promised not to sell or close any plants over the life of the new contract.<br>   The deal will be used as a blueprint in talks with Ford and General Motors.<br>   Annette Hamm reports.
<i><br>  The picket signs were ready, but not needed.  <br>  Minutes before the strike deadline of midnight, the CAW executive announced a deal had been reached with Chrysler Canada.  <br>  The deal gives the nearly 13-thousand union members at Chrysler a two per cent wage hike for each of the contract's three years.<br>  That's on top of cost of living increases.<br>  Currently, the average Chrysler worker makes 22 dollars and one cent an hour.<br>  Over the life of the new contract, they'll be paid for an extra ten days off.  <br>  As long as it's making money, Chrysler has agreed to replace any job it contracts out with a similar job at one of its plants.  <br>  Chrysler workers will vote on the agreement this Sunday.<br>  The Canadian Auto Workers will announce on Monday the second target company for negotiations.<br>  It's likely to be Ford, but the union warns General Motors will have to live up to the same provisions reached in the Chrysler deal, or face a nasty strike.</i>
<hr>
<b>Bosnia Elex</b><p>
The Bosnian election results are in and it appears, Bosnia's Muslim president will likely lead the new government's three-man presidency.<br>   Unofficial results show 72-year-old Alija Izeht-beg-o-vich received the most votes in Saturday's eleciton. Izeht-beg-o-vich has vowed to steer Bosnia away from war and separatism.<br>  His strongest opponent, a Serb nationalist, advocated making the Serb half of Bosnia a separate state.<br>    Both men will serve on the three-man presidency, along with the candidate of the leading Croat party.
<hr>
<b>Korean Sub</b><p>
The bodies of 11 North Koreans have been found on South Korea's east coast near an abandoned North Korean submarine.<br>   One man has been taken into custody.<br>   The South Korean Defence Ministry says it's not known how the 11 died.<br>  But a state-run TV station says they apparently committed suicide rather than risk capture.<br>  There has been no reaction from North Korea.
<hr>
<b>Agnew Obit</b><p>
<br>   Spiro Agnew, the only US vice president forced to resign in disgrace, is dead.<br>  Agnew died yesterday afternoon in a Maryland hospital.<br>   The cause of death has not been revealed.<br>  Agnew was Richard Nixon's point man and attacked the news media as "hopeless, hysterical hypochondriacs of history."<br>  He was forced to resign in 1973 after pleading guilty to tax evasion.<br>  Spiro Agnew was 77.

<hr>
<b>Simpson</b><p>
<br>  The judge in the O.J. Simpson civil trial has shown his no-nonsense approach to the case.<br>  He has made a number of quick rulings on issues of evidence that indicate he will not allow the Simpson team to put the Los Angeles Police Department on trial.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Temagami</b><p>
<br>   The battle between environmentalists and loggers in Temagami is heating up.<br>   Police arrested two more environmental protesters today after they chained themselves to a bridge on a logging road leading to an old-growth forest where cutting is to begin next week.<br>   Eleven other protesters were arrested in the area yesterday.
<hr>
<b>Underwater Logging</b><p>
<br>  Logging is also a contentious issue south of the border.<br>  From Maine to California, most of the old forests are gone.<br>  But CBS reporter Hattie Koffman has found someone logging old growth, and amazingly, he's not being called a villain.<br>  He's an underwater treasure hunter.<br>  You see, this story is about underwater logging, to get to the forest, you have to dive beneath the surface.
<hr>
<b>Plowing Match</b><p>
<br>  Following several days of rain, the Haldimand Norfolk International Plowing Match has been plowed under.<br>  Day one of the event was cancelled after a brief opening ceremony.<br>  Since mud wrestling is not a scheduled event, organizers will try again tomrrow.<br>

<hr>
<b>Copps - Return</b><p>
<br>  The House of Commons is back to business after its three month summer break and, while not exactly a rookie in the House of Commons, Sheila Copps is nonetheless the newest MP.<br>   Copps was sworn in today and brought in to the house on the arms of Prime Minister Chretien and defence minister David Collenette.<br>   She was re-elected in a summer byelection in her Hamilton riding, after resigning to fulfil a promise to quit if the GST was not abolished.<br>  Just hours into the new session, Copps and her new heritage ministry came under attack.
<hr>
<b>Chretien </b><p>
<br>     Prime Minister Jean Chretien has come out in support of his beleaguered defence minister, and the chief of the defence staff.<br>   Chretien has told the commons that David Collenette, General Jean Boyle and the Somalia inquiry, have jobs to do and the opposition parties should let them get on with them.<br>   The opposition parties have been calling for the resignation of Collenette and Boyle because of evidence given at the Somalia inquiry.
<hr>
<b>Charest - House</b><p>
<br>     Parliament may be back after its summer break, but statisticians are wondering if Tory leader Jean Charest should be returning to school.<br>   Today Charest blamed the Liberal government for presiding over the longest period of sustained high unemployment since the great depression.         <br>  Statistics Canada figures show that when charest served in the Tory government of Brian Mulroney, the unemployment figures were higher than they are now.
<hr>
<b>Enviro Protest</b><p>
<br>     Dozens of university students demonstrated at Queen's Park today to protest environmental moves by the Harris government.<br>   The group, Stop Environmental Deregulation in Canada, says Tories are taking "irresponsible" steps backward by allowing businesses to ignore the environment.<br>   It says many companies that have been charged with environmental offences in the past are now being allowed to regulate themselves.
<hr>
<b>Teachers College</b><p>
<br>   The Ontario government says a new R has been added to reading writing and arithmetic in the province's schools.<br>  And that new R stands for responsibility.<br>   Today, education minister John Snobelen unveiled the details of its new college of teachers.<br>  Mike Murphy has the story.
<i> For the first time... Ontario teachers will soon be able to police themselves. Teachers ave already begun registering with the province's new College of Teachers. A college that will set out training and professional standards for up to 200 thousand Ontario teachers.<br>  The college will be able to weed out the ones that are unfit. <br>   While teachers can stand for election appointed to the college's 31 member governing council..parents will also be involved. <br>  But the teachers unions haven't blunted their criticism of the college they call it an attack on teachers.<br>  Still says education minister John Snobelen many rank and file teachers are in favour of the college.<br>  And parents are demanding more accountability.<br>   Parents who are unhappy with their child's teacher can take their complaint to the new college. It's expected to be up and running early next year.</i>
<hr>
<b>Obesity Epidemic</b><p>
<br>    Scientists are warning that an obesity epidemic is threatening the world.<br>  And they say if present trends continue, by the year 2030 most of the population of the United States will be obese.<br>  Lauran Sabourin has more in this report.
<i>Scientists clain that obesity poses one of the fastest developing and most serious public health problems in North America.  And it's only getting worse.<br>  Young people gravitate toward fast food.  Fast food jingles that are ingrained in the young person's mind.<br>  We live in a society where bigger is often seen as better. <br>  At M.T. Bellies Restaurant in Welland customers are invited to take the M.T. Bellies challenge.   Four pounds of beef, bread and vegetables were delivered to Glen Mc Cluskey's table on a garbage can lid and if he eats it all the meal in 100 minutes it's free.<br>  Mc Cluskey was few minutes short the target.  He's hit with a bill of 35 dollars and get's his picture added to the wall of shame again. <br>  The M.T. Bellies challenge is all in fun, but medical experts say eating too much, being overweight isnt' a laughing matter.<br>  The increase in pounds brings with it a myriad of health problems, iincluding strokes, heart problems, infertility, diabestes and certain types of cancer.  Not the mention the stigma of being labelled fat.<br>  Books, videos weight loss seminars are big business in North America. <br>  The most disturbing part of this problem to the experts is that society isnt' as disturbed about obesity as it should be. </i>
<hr>
<b>OJ New Trial</b><p>
<br>    It may be hard to imagine an OJ Simpson trial without lights, cameras and action...but this week in Santa Monica ...the civil suit against Simpson begins and the all seeing eye of the TV camera is not invited.

<b>Bill 49</b><p>
<br>   A union representing textile workers in Ontario claims proposed amendments to the province's Employment Standards Act, will only serve to create more sweatshops across Ontario, that pay their workers below  minimum wages.<br>   The union made the claim today, in a brief to a government committee studying the proposed legislation.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Blood Ministers</b><p>
<br>     The future of the Red Cross as a blood agency hangs by a thread as Canada's health ministers meet in Toronto.<br>   They're looking at setting up a new national blood agency to try to restore confidence in the system.<br>   Ontario's Jim Wilson says the big sticking point in yesterday's talks, was what role the Red Cross might play.
<hr>
<b>Truck Safety</b><p>
<br>  The OPP and provincial inspectors are pulling unsafe rigs off the road in a truck safety blitz along Highway 400 from Toronto to Barrie.<br>   Today, transportation minister Al Palladini visited one of the eight inspection stations that has been set up.<br>  At one station alone, almost half of about 40 rigs checked, were taken out of service because of safety violations such as bad brakes, suspension problems and bald tires.<br>  The two- day blitz continues tomorrow.
<hr>
<b>Shoecam Court</b><p>
<br>   A retired high school teacher accused of peering under women's skirts with a shoe-camera at the Canadian National Exhibition, appeared in a Toronto courtroom today.<br>  62- year-old George Walter Campbell of Cornwall, was ordered to reappear in court October 8th on charges of sexual assault and mischief.<br>   Police allege, dozens of women were secretly videotaped by a man using a fibre-optic camera hidden in his shoe.<br>  Campbell was arrested over the Labor Day weekend.

<b>Hortense-Rico</b><p>
<br>  In world news tonight, at least five people were killed and another four are missing and feared dead after hurricane "Hortense" blasted through Puerto Rico.<br>  Torrential rains sent rivers over their banks, washed away cars and caused power outages in much of the island.<br>  The storm is expected to strike a glancing blow to the Dominican Republic, then head in a west- northwesterly direction toward the Turks and Caicos and southernmost Bahamas.

<hr>
<b>Bosnia Politics</b><p>
<br>  In Bosnia... there is no freedom of movement and little progress on arresting indicted war criminals who continue to poison the political environment.

Nonetheless the international community wants to press ahead saying things are unlikey to get better anytime soon. 
<hr>

<b>Harris - Paris</b><p>
<br>  A bold, "in your face" message to Quebec today from Ontario Premier Mike Harris.<br>  Five days into a trade mission to Europe, Harris made a direct pitch to French business leaders and investors to set up shop in Ontario.<br>  The move challenges Quebec's traditional close economic ties with France.<br>  But Harris maintains he's just telling the French where they can make a dollar, and he left untouched the question of what his actions will do to relations between Quebec and Ontario.<br>  
<hr>
<b>McLean Lie Detector</b><p>
<br>  Back at Queen's Park, meanwhile, controversy continues to surround Ontario legislature speaker Al McLean. Today, McLean's lawyer said his client passed a lie detector test on whether he sexually harassed one of his employees. Martin Teplitsky says McLean took the test, hoping to prove his innocence. This after aide Sandi Thompson formally complained two weeks ago that McLean sexually harassed her while she was working for him. 
<hr>
<b>Bluewater Follow</b><p>
<br>  Child advocates are calling for a judicial inquiry into the beating death of a sixteen-year-old inmate at the Wellington Detention Centre in Guelph.<br>  James Lonee died in Hamilton General Hospital on Saturday of massive head injuries sustained in the beating.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.
<i> Even though the Ministry of the Solcitor General is investigating James Lonnee's death, and an inquest will be held, champions of children's rights say that's not good enough.  <BR>Lonee's lawyer wants to know why he was transfered to the Wellington Detention Centre in Guelph, and put in a segregation cell with another inmate, even though the cell was meant for one person.  <BR>Lonnee's cell-mate has been charged with murder. Both of them had been at the Bluewater Detention Centre in Goderich, the scene of a riot last February. Lonnee's lawyer says her client had previously complained about being beaten up by other inmates, because he was co-operating with police investigating the riot.  </i>

<b>Temagami Bridge</b><p>
<br>  There are growing fears tonight that violence could erupt in the Temagami region of northern Ontario after police uncovered more steel spikes driven into trees to sabotage logging.

<hr>
<b>Day Care Reaction</b><p>
<br>  A proposed overhaul of Ontario's child care system, is coming under fire from day-care advocates.<br>  Yesterday, the Harris government announced a plan to create more spaces and subsidies for poor parents.<br>  But critics argue the proposal would cut millions of dollars from non-profit day care centres while forcing workers to take huge pay cuts.
<hr>
<b>Party Poll</b><p>
<br>   The federal tories should be pleased with a new opinion poll suggesting the party is bouncing back following last month's policy convention.<br>  The Angus Reid survey shows the Liberals still well ahead with the support of 53 per cent of those asked.<br>    But the big surprise is the five-point rise in Tory popularity, to 17 per cent.<br>   The Reform Party stands at 12 per cent and the New Democrats have six per cent support among those surveyed.

<hr>
<b>Iraq Calm</b><p>
<br>   All is quiet in Northern Iraq today, but a United Nations official says tension remains in the air.<br>  For the first time since Saturday, there's no fighting in the region.<br>  But the UN official says Iraqi troops are digging in near the city of Irbil (ur-beel').

<hr>
<b>McLean Resigns?</b><p>
<br>   Pressure is mouting for the speaker of the ontario legislature, Al McLean to step down.<br>  Three weeks ago, a female staff member of McLean's filed an informal complaint against the speaker alleging sexual harassment.<br>  Today that complaint was formalized when it was filed with the Ontario Human Rights Commission.<br>   
<hr>
<b>Child Care Changes</b><p>
<br>  A provincial government report released today, suggests Ontario give less money to non-profit day care centres, and spend more on private, home child care. <br>    Ontario currently spends 125-million dollars a year in wage subsidies to day-care staff.<br>  Most of that money goes to non-profit centres.<br>  The report says the money should be phased out over three years to put private and non-profit centres on a level playing field.<br>   The report also says rules should be loosened to allow each day-care worker to look after more children and qualifications should be relaxed.<br>  Social services minister Janet Ecker, who compiled the report, says there should be a test to deterine who is eligible for subsidized daycare.              <br>  The social services minister says the money saved could provide 12-thousand new daycare spaces to families that realy need it.
<hr>
<b>Doctors React</b><p>
<br>   Now that the Ontario government and its doctors are getting back to the negotiating table the doctors are reconsidering their strike threat.<br>  Doctors in Niagara led the strike initiative.  The fact that both sides are talking is a good sign.
<hr>
<b>Harris Trip</b><p>
<br>     Premier Mike Harris is in Frankfurt, Germany, today to start a nine-day trip to Europe.<br>   Harris will attend a private dinner tonight with German business people and investors.<br>   Tomorrow he will speak at a Canadian German business club luncheon and meet with banking officials.<br>   Harris will also visit Paris, London and Edinburgh as he tries to attract investment to Ontario.<br>   The Premier says he won't hesitate to boost Toronto's bid for the 2008 Olympics during his trip.
<hr>
<b>Yeltsin</b><p>
<br>     It seems the rumors about Boris Yeltsin's heart trouble were true.<br>   The 65-year-old Russian president says he will undergo heart surgery at the end of this month.<br>   He says his doctors gave him two choices -- an operation or a less stressful routine.<br>   Yeltsin has had two heart attacks in the past year and has virtually vanished from public sight since June.
<hr>
<b>Fran</b><p>
<br>   Hour by hour, the rain is getting heavier and the wind is getting more ferocious on the Carolinas' coast. Hurricane "Fran's" outer edge has begun swirling over a broad stretch of shore, north and south of the state line.<br>  People are still leaving the area in droves, trying to move inland -- away from Fran's expected landfall tonight.<br>

<hr>
<b>Specialty Channels</b><p>
<br>   Canadians will soon be able to pick and choose from a variety of new television channels.<br>   The federal broadcast regulator today approved 23 new specialty TV channels.<br>   They will offer services ranging from news and science to gardening and pre-school programming.<br>  The first group of the services is expected to be on the air by next September with the rest appearing by September of 1999.<br> Ian Dovey has more.                                        
<br>  <I>There will be more reasons to fight over the converter as the CRTC appoved 23 of 40 applications for specialty TV channels. <br>    Many of the new licencees are already big palyers in the TV industry, namely Chum and CTV. <br>     Some of the new channels will be operational within the year ...others by the fall of 1999.<br>  But the big challenge facing all 23 new specialty channels is whether they can win over enough subscribers to support their services.<br>  </I>
<hr>
<b>Morin Inquiry</b><p>
<br>   Guy Paul Morin spoke today as a commission of inquiry opened in Toronto to probe his wrongful conviction in the 1984 sex-slaying of nine-year-old Christine Jessop of Queensville.<br>   Morin says he's relieved a public examination of his wrongful murder conviction is finally under way.<br>   The previous NDP government had promised to hold an inquiry into the case.<br>   And Ontario premier Mike Harris included the inquiry among his election promises.<br>   Morin was eventually cleared of a 1992 conviction after new DNA evidence was presented.
<hr>
<b>Speaker Harassment</b><p>
<br>   MPP's may force the speaker of the legislature to step down, if charges of sexual harassment haven't been resolved before the legislature resumes sitting.<br> Government house leader Dave Johnson says speaker Al McLean could face resolutions calling for his removal if he's still in the speaker's chair September 24th.<br> McLean refuses to step down and denies the accusation made by female aide Sandi Thompson that he repeatedly sexually harassed her.<br>   Leaders of the two opposition parties have both called on McLean to step down until the matter is resolved. But premier Mike Harris has said he intends to let the investigative process unfold.
<hr>
<b>Iraq</b><p>
<br>     US president Clinton has declared the cruise missile strikes in Iraq a success.<br>   He says Saddam Hussein now knows there's a price to pay for attacking Kurds in northern Iraq.<br>   Clinton also says missiles have smashed air defence sites that might have threatened US warplanes.<br>   He says he discussed the situation in the Persian Gulf with prime minister Chretien last night.
<hr>
<b>Reaction</b><p>
<br>  International support for the US attack on Iraq, meanwhile, has been limited.<br>  The US decision to attack unilaterally, may also take its toll on gulf-war alliances.
<hr>
<b>Mother Teresa</b><p>
<br>     Mother Teresa may return home this week.<br>  Her doctors in Calcutta say the 86-year-old nun is making progress against a chest infection and heart problems.<br>    The Nobel Peace Prize laureate was admitted to hospital last month with a fever brought on by malaria.

<b>Iraq</b><p>
<br>     US president Clinton says Saddam Hussein must pay a price for the weekend assault on a Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq.<br>   Early today, the US launched a cruise missile attack against Iraqi military targets in retaliation for the incursion.<br>   Clinton says the US is also extending the no-fly zone in southern Iraq.<br>   Saddam has ordered his troops to ignore "no-fly" zones and to go after foreign aircraft.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Kurd </b><p>
<br> The US attack on Iraq is getting mixed international reviews.<br>  Britain, Germany and Japan support the attack.<br>  Russia and China are opposed.<br>  And in Ottawa, foreign affairs minister Lloyd Axworthy says the Chretien government supports the missile strikes completely.
<hr>
<b>OPSEU Strike</b><p>
<br>  The Ontario Public Service Union is involved in its second strike this year. But this time around, "it" is the target.<br>  The dispute involves OPSEU and it's very own staff.
<hr>
<b>Bertrand </b><p>
<br> A Quebec city lawyer might not go ahead with his case challenging future referendums on Quebec sovereignty.<br>  But Guy Bertrand says that is only if the Parti Quebecois government decides not to proceed with a challenge to his argument.<br>  Bertrand maintains that Quebec can't unilaterally declare sovereignty.
<hr>
<b>Prostate Treatment</b><p>
<br>   There's new hope for men who suffer from prostate disease.<br>  Fifty percent of men over the age of sixty, suffer from the disease that causes an enlarged prostate.<br>  But as Lauran Sabourin reports a new drug developed by a canadian researcher shows promise in controlling the disease.
<i><br>  The drug is called Proscar.<br>  It was tested on 13 hundred men in a number of Canadian cities during six clinical trials.<br>  The results indicated that the drug caused an enlarged prostate gland to shrink. <br>  A reduction in the size of the prostate gland improves urine flow and relieves painful symptoms. <br>  The Canadian specialists who conducted the study are excited about its findings.<br>   They say the drug Proscar treats the underlying cause of the disease rather than just the symptoms.<br>  By blocking the production of the hormone linked to the disease.<br>  It reduces the need for invasive and expensive surgery. <br>  The prescription drug is taken orally once a day and has few side effects.</i>
<hr>
<b>Tears Update</b><p>
There is a growing controversy over an apparent religious miracle in Toronto.<br>  The Toronto Sun is reporting the church, where a religious icon is said to be weeping, is run by a priest, accused of being a brothel employee.<br>   The newspaper says ecclesiastical records show Father Leronimos Katseas was excommunicated from the traditional Greek Orthodox Church back in 1993.<br>   Despite those allegations, worshippers continue to line up waiting to see the weeping painting of the virgin Mary.<br>   The alleged tears were first noticed sunday at the small church, which is a member of a breakaway Greek Orthodox sect.

<hr>
<b>UAW Strike Target</b><p>
<br> The United Auto Workers Union in the US has delayed deciding which company to target in national contract talks. And that has put a lot of pressure on the Canadian Auto Workers union, who has already given its deadline for targeting one of the big three auto makers. 
<hr>
<b>Premiers</b><p>
 Premier Mike Harris says it's important to get the premiers talking about potential solutions, not just problems.<br> Speaking at the premiers meeting in Jasper, Alberta, Harris said the provinces and territories should be given more control over their own affairs.<br> He adds the premiers agree the status quo is not working.<br> Harris also says the premiers are not as divided on federal-provincial power-sharing as has been reported.
<hr>
<b>Liberal Convention</b><p>
<br> And then there were six...the newest candidate for the Liberal leadership position is MPP Annamarie Castrilli of Toronto.<br> She has not formally declared her candidacy, but her office confirms Castrilli is in the running and her papers have been filed with the party.<br> The other MPP's are Dalton McGuinty, Dwight Duncan, Joe Cordiano, John Gerretsen who announced yesterday and Gerard Kennedy.
<hr>
<b>Biker Wars</b><p>
<br> Police say biker gangs vying for control of the drug trade between Toronto and the US border see Hamilton as a prize ripe for the picking. So far, the battle has been played out among established Ontario gangs -- Satan's Choice, Outlaws and, in Hamilton, the Red Devils. Police believe the Hell's Angels are preparing to launch a major offensive for control. A spokesman for the Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police says the angels "want Ontario." And police say the angels are notorious for violence when moving into new territory.<br> The Hell's Angels is the predominant bike gang in Canada outside Ontario.<br> There are 11 chapters across Canada but only individual members in Ontario, the outlaws are most influential gang in Ontario.<br> There's evidence that established bikers in the Hamilton area are preparing to confront the angels and police believe there may be an alliance or truce between gangs and police worry a new round of violence could follow.
<hr>
<b>Parolin Follow</b><p>
<br> A six year old Princeton, B.C. boy badly mauled by a cougar was told yesterday, that his heroic mother Cindy Parolin died while saving his life. Princeton mayor John Stinson says the interior community is rallying its support around Cindy's husband ...Les Parolin and his four children. Support that includes a memorial fund and a scholarship.
<hr>
<b>Raccoon Rabies</b><p>
The Ministry of Natural Resources is taking its fight against raccoon rabies across the US border into upper New York state.<br> Ministry spokesman Charles McGinnis says Ontario has put-up 125-thousand dollars towards a cross-border program to drop vaccine-laden bait in the state this fall.<br> It's part of a prevention program aimed at keeping raccoon rabies out of Ontario.<br> Ministry planes will also be dropping the vaccine over parts of southeastern Ontario in September.
<hr>
<b>Iguanas Evicted </b><p>
<br> Tenants in a downtown Toronto apartment building have gone to court to have a pair of iguanas evicted.<br> A judge has ruled that Chico and Chocolate, interfered with the comfort and enjoyment of the mainly elderly tenants of the building. Some of the 70 residents, who signed a petition, complained that they were afraid to have their grandchildren visit because of the lizards. However the owner of the pet iguanas, Frank Gonzales says his pets wouldn't hurt a fly. And that the management is out to get him because he won a court case against them. <br>  (clip)
<hr>
<b>Computer Virus</b><p>
<br> Today was a good day to give your home computer a rest. A virus was set to attack PC's when the date read August 22nd. Macintosh users are off the hook, but IBM-compatible PC users be forewarned. Computers that are infected will get a message saying "HD Euthanasia by Demon Emperor." No one knows where the virus came from, but it may have spread from a world wide web site that offers sharewhere. The virus is also set to attack again on September 22nd.
<hr>
<b>TWA Update</b><p>
<br> The recovered body count has now reached 209 in the TWA crash. Most of the missing victims from TWA flight 800 were seated in the middle of the airplane. And that's where investigators think the explosion that brought the plane down occurred. That word comes from Robert Francis of the US National Transportation Safety Board today. He also says investigators continue running tests, trying to determine exactly what destroyed the plane.
<hr>
<b>Straw House</b><p>
<br> You have no doubt heard about the house that Jack built...then there was noted condo construction project of the three little pigs, but its not likely you've heard the story of the house being built by Moira Hepburn.<br> She may have started a brand new trend in construction as we see in this report.

<b>Bailey Bashing</b><p>
 Canadians, fed up with Americans who refuse to acknowledge Donovan Bailey as the world's fastest man, are fighting back with their pocketbooks. The battle is being spearheaded by a Niagara Falls man and Bailey's hometown newspaper. Bob Ireland has the story.
<i><br>  Mike Leskiw is a quiet Niagara Falls body shop owner who usually minds his own business. But when he say the American tv show Entertainment Tonight, refer to US Olympic runner Michael Johnson as the fastest man in the world, not Canadian Donovan Bailey, he saw red.<br>  Both Donovan Bailey and Michael Johnson broke world records at the Atlanta Olympic games. Johnson ran the 200 metres in 19.32 seconds. But Bailey, seen here in another race, ran the 100 metres in 9.84 seconds, and is considered the fastest man in the world. Although Entertainment Tonight appologized to Leskiw, the 41 year Niagara Falls man said that is not enough. He has donated one thousand dollars of his family's vacation money,towards a full page ad in 'USA Today' to remind Americans who really is the fastest man in the world.<br>  The Oakville Beaver, the newspaper in Bailey's home town has also jumped on the band wagon, and has already bought the five thousand dollar full page ad which will run next week in the USA Today edition distributed in Johnson's home town of Dallas Texas. Beaver publisher Ian Oliver says suuport from local people and business has been fantastic.<br>  Oliver says more than the required 5-thousand dollars has been raised and he hopes to have the ad run in other American cities as well. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Gerretsen for Libs</b><p>
<br>     A former mayor of Kingston is joining the Ontario Liberal Leadership race.<br>   John Gerretsen is now the MPP for Kingston and the islands.<br>   Gerretsen -- who plans to officially announce his candidacy tomorrow -- is the fifth MPP to seek the job currently held by Lyn Mcleod.<br>   Two party activists are also seeking the leadership.<br>   Gerretsen says he's running because Ontario is becoming a province of haves and have-nots, and he doesn't like that.
<hr>
<b>Boyle - Wednesday</b><p>
<br>   General Jean Boyle says the Somalia Inquiry commissioners should look at his overall record if they're questioning his leadership skills.<br>   Boyle accuses the inquiry of spending too much time on what he considers to be a minor mistake by his staff in altering documents and not telling him.<br>   Boyle says the public affairs branch was only one aspect of his job before he became chief of defence staff.<br>   The general said the defence minister seemed to be pleased enough with his record before he elevated him to the top post.
<hr>
<b>Dental Health</b><p>
<br>     A Health Canada report out today, says there's no reason to ban the use of dental fillings containing mercury or to have them removed.<br>   The deparment has rejected findings from an earlier study that suggested that having more than four amalgam fillings posed a health risk.<br>   The department statement says current evidence does not indicate that fillings containing mercury, are causing illness in the general population.
<hr>
<b>Gorilla Boy</b><p>
<br>   A three year old boy, rescued by a gorilla after falling six metres into a gorilla pit, has been released from hospital.<br>   The boy, whose name has not been released, was upgraded to good condition and released yesterday from a Chicago-area hospital.<br>   He suffered mild bruising of his brain tissue after falling into a gorilla compound at the Brookfield Illinois, zoo on friday.<br>   Doctors say he'll probably recover fully.<br>   They also say he does not remember being carried by Binti, a mother gorilla whose protective, maternal actions in the incident made her famous.
<hr>
<b>Tainted Blood</b><p>
<br>   Canada is not the only country undergoing a tainted blood scandal.<br>   Japan's top supplier of blood and blood products, was raided by government officials, after being charged with deliberately selling HIV-tainted products over the last ten years.
<hr>
<b>DeKlerk</b><p>
<br>  It was an apology many South Africans feel was long overdue.<br>  Former South African President FW De Klerk, today accepted responsiblility for human rights abuses committed while he led that country's white minority government.

<b>Escarpment Future</b><p>
<br>   Environmental groups say the ontario government has quietly given gravel companies freer reign to dig quarries in the Niagara Escarpment.<br>   The groups say the province recently exempted many aggregate firms from legislation designed to protect the escarpment.<br>   A lawyer for the Canadian Environmental Law Association says it's clear what he calls "the scorched-earth policy" of the government has now been extended to the escarpment.              <br>  Environment minister Norm Sterling could not be reached for comment.
<hr>
<b>CMA</b><p>
<br> They support a publicly funded, universal health-care system.<br>   But Canada's doctors want to start talking about a private system of delivering health-care.<br>   Both apparently conflicting resolutions, have passed at the Canadian Medical Association meeting in Nova Scotia.<br>   The vote comes a day after health minister David Dingwall told delegates the federal government won't support a two-tier medical system.
<hr>
<b>Boyle </b><p>
<br>     Canada's top soldier suggests he was betrayed by military staff who altered documents for release to the media without telling him of the changes.<br>   General Jean Boyle has told the Somalia Inquiry that if that's how his staff acted, they lacked integrity and moral fibre.<br>   The chief of defence staff added he did not know the documents that were released to the media had been altered, even though he signed them.
<hr>
<b>Labrador Helicopter</b><p>
<br>  Newly released federal documents say the engines on Canada's helicopters are notoriously unreliable.<br>  But crews are going to have to live with them because upgrading to safer engines would be too expensive.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Cougar Attack</b><p>
<br>     A 36-year-old British Columbia woman has made the ultimate sacrifice in saving her six-year-old son from a cougar attack.<br>   Cindy Parolin went after the cat with a stick when it attacked her son during a family horseback outing late yesterday.<br>   Her two other children then managed to rescue their injured brother and seek help from campers.<br>   But by the time they returned, it was too late and the woman was later pronounced dead in hospital.
<hr>
<b>Belgium Horror House</b><p>
<br>   In Belium, police have made a new discovery in their investigation into a kidnapping ring run by pedophiles.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Korea Wrap</b><p>
<br>   South Korean riot police stormed a university building to end a seven-day occupation by students.<br>   A battle between police and about one-thousand students left much of a classroom block smashed and gutted by fire.<br>   But the casualty list has risen into the hundreds.

<b>AMO - Leach</b><p>
 Ontario voters in municipal elections may soon be able to cast their votes by telephone or computer. And municipal elections may be held in October instead of November. These are just some of the possible changes advanced at a convention of Ontario municipalities in Toronto. 

<hr>
<b>McGuinty - Leadership</b><p>
<br>  Ottawa area MPP Dalton McGuinty, is now the third person to enter the Ontario Liberal Leadership race.<br>   With his family at his side, McGuinty arrived at Queens Park this morning to announce that he will seek his party's leadership at a convention to be held this November in Toronto.<br>  McGuinty, who has been an MPP for six years, says unlike premier Harris who believes in less government, he believes government should play a significant role in shaping the type of environment in which most Ontarians wish to live.             <br>  Although there could be as many as six candidates in the running for the Liberal leadership, to date, only two other MPPs, Dwight Duncan of Windsor and Gerard Kennedy of Toronto, have declared their intentions.
<hr>
<b>CMA</b><p>
<br>     The Canadian Medical Association isn't getting any support from Ottawa, as it prepares to debate the merits of a two-tier medical system.<br>   Health Minister David Dingwall told the association's annual meeting today, the rich will not be allowed to receive better care simply because they can afford it.<br>  But members of the association say they are being forced into a two-tier system because of cutbacks in funding by Ottawa.             <br>       The issue of a two-tiered medical system is expected to be debated tomorrow at the association's meeting in Sydney, Nova Scotia.
<hr>
<b>Bernardo Girlfriend</b><p>
<br>   A woman, who wishes to keep her identity a secret, says she has renewed an old relationship with convicted killer Paul Bernardo.<br>   The woman, who is in her late 20s, has told Maclean's Magazine she still has a strong emotional attachment to Bernardo.<br>   She says she simply can't explain why she is still attracted to a man who has been convicted of the sex-slayings of two Niagara-area teens and the rape of 18 other women.
<hr>
<b>Yeltsin Sick</b><p>
<br> In world news tonight, the Kremlin is denying an American magazine report that Russian president Boris Yeltsin is ailing.<br>   Time Magazine says Yeltsin is so sick, he is considering going abroad for heart surgery.<br>   He has been seen publicly only once since winning re-election.<br>   That was at his inauguration and he appeared weak and frail.
<hr>
<b>Chechnya Victims</b><p>
<br>   A cease-fire is said to be in place in the Chechen capitol of Grozny.<br>   But, that doesn't mean the violence is over.
<hr>
<b>Gorilla Follow</b><p>
<br>  Here's an update now on a story we first brought you Friday.<br>  Doctors in Brookfield Illinois have upgraded the condition of toddler who was seriiously injured at a local zoo.<br>  The three year old boy, climbed over a metre high fence and plunged six metres into the concrete Gorilla pit that housed seven Gorillas.<br>  With her own baby on her back, a female Gorilla, approached the child, cradled him in her arms and brought him to a gate where he was retrieved by paramedics.<br>

<b>Cabinet Shuffle</b><p>

<br>     Chief of defence staff general Jean Boyle continues to be grilled at the Somalia inquiry over document tampering.<br>   The military's top officer denies giving the o-k to release altered briefing notes.<br>   Others have told the probe that Boyle -- who was then associate deputy minister responsible for policy and communication -- did in fact authorize the release of the documents.            <br>   During three days of testimony before the commission, the general has distanced himself from a scandal over tampered documents related to the ill-fated mission to somalia.

<b>Axworthy </b><p>
<br>  For the second time in just over a month, a Canadian tourist has been sexually assaulted while visiting the island of Bermuda.<br>  Last month, 17 year old Rebecca Middleton was raped and killed.<br>  Just yesterday, a Canadian woman was sexually attacked during a home robbery.<br>   Bermuda police say the attackers also bound and robbed two other Canadians that were in the home, one of whom is a Canadian senator.<br>   Canadas foreign affairs minister believes it may be time to issue a travel warning to canadian tourists.
<hr>
<b>Preemies - Life</b><p>
<br>  For nearly 25 years doctors and nurses at Hamilton's Chedoke Mcmaster Hospitals have been pulling off miracles as they help pre-mature infants begin life outside the womb...<br>  Many of those preemies develop normally, but others do not... and as Jamie West reports...a recently published study indicates that despite disabilities, years later those preemies say they're doing just fine...
<i><br>  Cara is just over a month old, weighs 790 grams is a part of a group known as extremely low birth weight babies...<br>  Three in every thousand check in at under three pounds...and their survival rate has climbed to 75 percent over the last twenty years. <br> 25 percent of this study group have disabilities ranging from visual impairment to severe cerebral palsy ...but after 16 years of tracking they've told researchers their quality of life is about the same as full term youngsters...<br>  Quality of life included their mobility, vision hearing, mental functioning, emotional well being, pain and self care abilities.<br>   The information could eventually help doctors and ultimately parents grapple with the often difficult dilemma of knowing how much technology to apply in order to save the life of a baby born in the 23 or 24 week of gestation. <br>  </i>

<b>Big Baby</b><p>
<br>  And from underwight babies to the story of an overweight baby who simply cannot stop growing.<br>

<b>Lucky Chutist</b><p>
<br>  What at first appeared to be a picture perfect dive, ended in a terrifying free fall for a rookie parachutist... and it was all captured on tape.

<b>Somalia </b><p>
<br>    The military's top officer says he can't guarantee a public inquiry will ever get all the documents it wants to investigate the Canadian Airborne Regiment's ill-fated mission to Somalia.<br>   General Jean Boyle told the inquiry today that he found out late last week that some intelligence documents were destroyed as late as February.<br>   He ordered an investigation of the unit that was responsible for the destroyed reports.<br>   The commission spent three hours grilling Boyle -- in his second day of testimony -- about the defence department's tardiness in turning over some documents and complete failure to deliver others.
<hr>
<b>Alberta Train</b><p>
<br>  Three people are now said to be missing and presumed dead, after a CN Rail freight train collided with a block of misplaced cars and caught fire in west-central Alberta.<br>   The crash occurred last night on CN's main line in a forested area about 200-kilometres west of Edmonton.<br>   Two crew members and another man have been missing ever since.<br>   Several of the cars in the BC-bound train were carrying products classified as dangerous materials.<br>   But it appears there's no threat to the environment or people in the area.
<hr>
<b>Train Derailment</b><p>
<br> Investigators meanwhile, have pinpointed a likely cause of Saturday's train derailment in Kerwood, Ontario, west of London.<br>   CN Rail officials are focusing on an empty  car, which was the first of 37 to leave the tracks.<br>   They're checking for worn wheels, axles or suspension -- all of which may have caused the car to lift off the tracks.<br>   More than 200 people were forced from their homes for about 12 hours, after one of the derailed cars began spewing sulphuric acid.
<hr>
<b>Ipperwash Demo</b><p>
 <br>  Business at the Sarnia courthouse continued without interruption today, despite the noise and tension of an angry protest outside.<br>  The provincial police officer accused of shooting a Chippewa protester at Ipperwash last year was making a court appearance.<br>  Alex Reynolds reports.
<i> <br>  Police fought to keep about 30 aboriginal demonstrators away from more than 80 cottagers who are upset with the continued occupation of Ipperwash Provincial Park. <br>  The cottagers call themselves "on-fire" - an acronym for Ontario Federation for Individual Rights and Equality.<br>  The group was showing support for police efforts to end the occupation of the park.<br>  Acting provincial police Sgt. Kenneth Deane made a brief court appearance on a charge of criminal negligence causing the death of Dudley George.<br>  George was shot in September 1995 when protesters occupying Ipperwash Provincial Park clashed with police at the gates. <br>  The aboriginals claim racism is at the root of "on-fire's" support for the police.<br>  They deny there has been any harassment of cottagers or residents around Ipperwash.<br>  Sarnia police kept the two groups apart as the protesters hurled insults at each other for about 30 minutes.<br>  Aboriginal groups and even the federal indian affairs minister have called for a public inquiry into the shooting, but the province has refuse.</i>
<hr>
<b>Hospital Closings</b><p>
<br>     Hospital administrators are reacting with shock at reports the Ontario Health Ministry wants to close an extra four hospitals in metro Toronto.<br>   That would bring the total on the chopping block to 15.<br>   The Toronto area currently has 44 hospitals.<br>   A final decision on the cuts is expected by fall.
<hr>
<b>Electronic Cop</b><p>
<br>  Run a red light in toronto, and you may soon be captured on tape, facing a hefty fine.<br>   Toronto is just one of many Candian cities considering the traffic light version of photo radar, to catch motorists who fail to obey traffic signals.<br>   
<hr>
<b>Gun Control</b><p>
<br>  The rejection of a law calling for handgun control, has triggered a political fight in Britain.<br>   For many, it's an emotional issue following the school massacre in Dunblane, Scotland.<br>   
<hr>
<b>Fidel at 70</b><p>
<br>  He has been Cuba's maximum leader for more than half of his life-time.<br>  And by all accounts, he may continue to lead Cuba for some time to come.<br>  Fidel Castro turned 70 years old today and despite a number of assassination attempts, and the efforts of nine US presidents, he has emerged as one of history's ultimate political survivors.<br>

<b>Doctors - Update</b><p>
 The clock is ticking as segments of Ontario's doctors threaten to stop taking new patients, unless the harris government comes through with an extra half -a-billion dollars. So far the province is saying no. 
<hr>
<b>Olsen - Faint Hope</b><p>
  <br>  One of Canada's most reviled serial killers is eligible to apply for early parole today.<br>  Clifford Olson was sentenced in 1982 to life in prison for killing eleven children in British Columbia.<br>  But as Lauran Sabourin reports the families of those children feel they're being victimized all over again.
<i><br>  Eleven victims ...eleven tormented families.<br>  The legacy of Clifford Olson.<br>  The man brutally tortured his young victims.<br>  Is now eligble to apply for early parole.<br>  A loophole in the justice system that causes Ray King to relive the pain.<br>  The section of the criminal code that first degree murderers to apply for early parole is section 745.,  a section that public, the police victims' rights groups want changed.<br>    CAVEAT, Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination has been leading the fight for changes to the criminal code.<br>  They dont' believe that Clifford Olson will get the opportunity to apply for early parole. But as they see it, that's not the point.<br>  The messages in CAVEAT literature shout that instead of locking a killer up for life.<br>  745 gives them a revolving turnstile to freedom. <br> And while the propoents of section 745 argue that in a convict sentenced to life should be rewarded for good behavior,  the victims families will say that they too have been handed a life sentence. A  sentence that comes with no rewards. </i>
<hr>
<b>Perot - Conv.</b><p>
Not far from the Republican Convention, American reformers are meeting in Long Beach, California.<br>  Two candidates, billionaire Ross Perot and former Colorado governor Richard Lamm are battling for the reform party presidential nomination.<br>   Lamm, is hoping against long odds to steal the nomination from party founder Perot.<br>   Perot founded the reform party and won 19 per cent of the vote as an independent in the 1992 presidential race.
<hr>
<b>Ireland Standoff</b><p>
<br> A tense weekend of demonstrations in northern Ireland ended peacefully today, when a protestant march was allowed to pass through a largely roman Catholic village after a lengthy stand-off.<br>  Police and clergymen brokered an end to a 20-hour confrontation between pro-irish catholics and protestants loyal to Britain.<br>  Police had feared the weekend parades would spark a repeat of widespread rioting a month ago.
<hr>
<b>China Floods</b><p>
<br> The death toll continues to rise as heavy rains continue to lash southeast China.<br>   250 have died and nearly 300,000 people dispalced by the flood waters.<br>   In neighbouring Fujian Province, the torrential rains have killed at least 233, with 284 missing.<br>  Economic losses have been estimated at more than 200 billion dollars.
<hr>
<b>Octuplets</b><p>
<br>  The issue of selective abortion made headlines in Britain recently, in the case of a low income mother who chose to abort one of two healthy twin-fetuses.<br>  Another case that's drawing attention also concerns multiple-embryo's and controversial health issues.

<b>Jobless</b><p>
<br> Analysts are pouring over the latest unemployment figures... nationally it was slightly improved last month over June.<br>   Stats Canada says the rate was 9.89 for July, down a bit from 10 per cent in June.<br>   Ontario's jobless figures fell slightly to 9.2 per cent from nine and a half.<br>   Compared to an average of the previous three months, the July employment picture looked brighter in Hamilton and St. Catharines- Niagara.<br>   But there were more people out of work in Oshawa, Toronto and London.
<hr>
<b>New Jobs Harris</b><p>
<br>   About 89-thousand jobs have been created in Ontario in the last 13 months. But an economist says premier Mike Harris cannot take credit for those jobs... even though they've come since he took office.<br>   MMS International economist Andrew Pyle says the strength of the American economy has more to do with the new jobs than any government policy here.
<hr>
<b>Rates</b><p>
 Rates on the move again today.. the Bank of Canada has cut its lending rate one-quarter percentage point, to 4.5 per cent. That, in turn, has triggered a quarter point cut in the prime at the banks to six per cent. 
<hr>
<b>Pension Hit</b><p>
 Low income workers and their employers could be hit with hefty increases in Canada Pension Plan premiums if Ontario and Quebec have their way. Sources out of Ottawa say, ontario is pushing the federal government to reduce the amount of wages that are exempt from CPP premiums. 
<HR>
<b>Engine Trouble</b><p>
<br>  The dog that flies was forced to limp home, with its tail between its legs, this morning. A Greyhound Air 727 bound for Winnipeg out of Hamilton, was forced to abort the flight and return for an emergency landing at Mount Hope Airport; due to an electrical problem with one of the aircraft's three engines. No one was injured; but the incident; has raised new questions about the safety of discount airlines.
<hr>
<b>Discount Flying</b><p>
<br>   It was a shakey start for greyhound airlines which suffered many setbacks and months of delays. But the low cost carrier says business is been booming since it began trans-continental service last month.<br>  Today the airline said it expects to fill 85 of its available seats this month.<br>  The question is can cut-rate carriers like Greyhound survive?<br>  Industry watchers say a lot depends on its safety record and Canadians long-term committment to no-frills travel.
<hr>
<b>Parrott Accused</b><p>
<br>   Frank Roy denies he raped and killed 11-year-old Alison Parrott 10 years ago.<br>   The 38-year-old is charged with first-degree murder in the Toronto girl's brutal death.<br>   Roy says he'll plead not guilty.<br> And he denounces as "hogwash" the police investigation into whether he's behind the slayings of several Vancouver prostitutes.
<hr>
<b>Becky Fund</b><p>
<br>   A trust fund set up by a Bermuda dentist to honor murdered Belleville teenager Rebecca Middleton.<br>   Dr. Ian Campbell has raised sixty two thousand doolars in the scholarship trust fund so far. Middleton was was raped and stabbed to death in Bermuda last month.  The two men charged in the teen's death will appear in court again August 22nd.
<hr>
<b>Women - Abuse </b><p>
<br>   A study released today puts a huge price tag on sexual assault and abuse of women in Canada. According to a the new comprehensive report examines violence against women costs 4.2 billion dollars a year.  Over four hundred million is spent on medical treatments alone. <br>  
<hr>
<b>Food Drive</b><p>
<br>     Donations of non-perishable food items are still badly needed in a province-wide food drive.<br>   The food drive by 180 food banks began two weeks ago. but not nearly enough food has been collected...<br>   donations can be made at IGA, Food City and other stores with the Oshawa Food Group.
<hr>
<b>Yeltsin</b><p>
 <br>  Boris Yeltsin has been sworn in as Russia's president at a colourful ceremony at the Kremlin. In his speech, Yeltsin promised to uphold the Russian constitution and protect human rights. But the 65-year-old president spoke for just 45 seconds as he took the oath of office in his first public appearance since June 26th. Yeltsin had two heart attacks last year and his disappearance in the run-up to the inauguration had prompted speculation that he was ill again. He has been resting in a sanatorium near Moscow for the last three weeks and is expected to take a longer vacation soon.
<hr>
<b>Chechnya</b><p>
 Meanwhile, a political headache for Yeltsin continues to worsen. Russian troops have retreated from parts of Grozny. Rebels have tightened their grip on the Chechen capital and say they have seized two buildings held by the Moscow-run government. Journalists trapped in the battle zone have issued appeals for help and say some of the government buildings are on fire.
<hr>
<b>Ireland Update</b><p>
Tension is running high in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, where a Catholic March is planned for tonight and a Protestant parade is set for tomorow. Extra police and british soldiers will be on patrol amid fears that each side will violently protest the other's march. Unrest sparked by the route of a protestant march in Portadown last month left one man dead and scores injured in the mainly roman catholic city.
<hr>
<b>Buck House</b><p>
<br> Britain's royal family is in disrepute as never before. But that's not putting off the crowds queuing up to walk the same halls and gaze at the same walls as the royals. Buckingham Palace has just opened again to the public for two months while the Queen's away, and this year is looking just as lucrative as ever.

<b>Casino Rama</b><p>
<br>   Ontario's newest casino wants to get the message out: bring your cash -- but not your kids. <br>   
Up to a hundred kids were seen roaming around the parking lot of Casino Rama on Saturday... left to entertain themselves by parents eager to make a buck.. after that, the casino started turning people away who arrived with chidren under nineteen in their cars ...<br>  At one point, casino officials went on the PA system and asked people to retrieve their kids, who were wandering around unattended.
<hr>
<b>Smoking Suit </b><p>
<br>   The battle over the city of Toronto's tough new anti-smoking bylaw is going to end up in the courts. <br>     The Ontario Restaurant Association has announced a legal challenge of the bylaw due to go into effect January 1st of next year.<br>   The by-law prohibits smoking in all Toronto bars, restaurants, pubs and night clubs.<br>   Association president Paul Oliver says they will argue that the bylaw restricts people's freedom of choice because it reduces the public's ability to decide where they can eat and drink.  <br>  
<hr>
<b>Mortgage </b><p>
<br>     Consumers are in for more interest-rate relief.<br>   Long-term mortgage rates are falling at both the Royal and the Bank of Montreal.<br>   The five-year rate falls to 7.95 per cent, down from 8.10 per cent.<br>   The move follows cuts in short-term mortgages and other consumer lending rates last week.  <br>  
<hr>
<b>Royal Trust</b><p>
<br> Meanwhile thousands of Canadians were left short of cash after Royal Trust accidentally withdrew their mortgage or loan payments twice over the weekend. The bank says the problem was caused by human error at the London processing centre. All affected customers were to have their accounts corrected today.
<hr>
<b>Bad Boss Hotline</b><p>
 Ever feel like ratting on your boss... well now there's a way to do it. The Ontario Federation of Labor says the Harris government's intention to relax employment standards, is encouraging some employers to short change their workers. And now the OFL has introduced its "bad boss" hotline, where workers can tell all.  
<hr>
<b>Pregnant Complaints</b><p>
<br>     The impact of the bitter battle between Ontario's doctors and the Harris government is already being felt.<br>   A spokesman for the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons says they are getting hundreds of calls from pregnant women who are having trouble finding doctors who will deliver their babies.<br>   Dozens of obstetricians, and other specialists, are refusing to take on new patients in the dispute with Queen's Park.<br>   Most of the calls are from southern Ontario, especially parts of Toronto, nearby Peel Region, Niagara and Windsor.<br>   The doctors want the health ministry to fully restore subsidies for their malpractice insurance and to stop clawbacks of their fees.
<hr>
<b>Glue Sniffer</b><p>
  The controversial case of a pregnant woman hooked on glue sniffing is in the news again. <br>  The woman has won a stay of a judge's order that would force her into a treatment centre for her addiction. Social workers sought the order because of the damage she could due to her unborn child. She has two other kids already suffering developmental problems due to her glue sniffing.<br>  The father of the baby says even though the woman doesn't have to go the the treatment centre now.. she will stay in hospital and received care.
<hr>
<b>Train Crash</b><p>
 <br> Two people are believed dead and up to 40 trapped after a crowded commuter train crashed into an empty train just north of London. The accident happened at the height of the evening rush-hour just north of the busy Watford Junction. Police say about 100 people are injured.
<hr>
<b>Spain Floods</b><p>
Flash floods are now being blamed for more than 60 deaths at a campsite near the border between France and Spain. The flooding has swept away trees, tents and pieces of furniture. Officials say about 140 people were injured in the torrent of water, rocks and mud. divers and firefighters looking for more victims today fear the death toll will rise. When the heavy rains started last night, up to 800 people were camped at the site. Dozens of people, including many children, have been evacuated and put up in hotels, police stations and private homes in the area.
<hr>
<b>Immigrant Beating</b><p>
 <br>   A California sheriff's deputy has lost his job over the videotaped beating of two illegal immigrants. Today's "Los Angeles Times" says Riverside County fired Tracy Watson yesterday.  TV news crews videotaped Watson and another deputy beating two Mexicans after an April chase. The officers involved are appealing ..they say their use of force was justified.
<hr>
<b>TWA Bodies</b><p>
 <br>   A medical examiner concludes most of the TWA crash victims met a sudden end. Doctor Charles Wetli says most of the victims suffered "massive whiplash" that snapped their necks -- right after an explosion rocked the 747 off New York. Two hundred and thirty peole were killed when the plane blew up last month. Officials don't believe they will ever find the remaining thirty five bodies that have not been recovered yet.
<hr>
<b>Mars</b><p>
<br>  And a footnote now to our life on Mars coverage yesterday... <br>     NASA researchers are challenging other scientists to prove them wrong. They have claimed that microscopic particles inside a meteorite from Mars contain signs of life. But other experts say organic material is not necessarily proof that life exists or existed. NASA says it welcomes skepticism, in the hope some one will find the definitive truth. The answer to the eternal question ...are we alone.

<b>Health Coalition</b><p>
 A coalition of some 80 citizen groups across the province, are demanding an immediate moratorium on health care cuts until full public hearings are held. The groups accuse the Harris government of placing profit ahead of people's health needs. 
<hr>
<b>Smog Shots</b><p>
 Meanwhile health officials are continuing to advise people to take precautions in this heat and pollution... even young healthy people.  Cut back on exercising, drink plenty of fluids - and no - alcohol doesn't count...<br>   Stay indoors away from the heat and humidity ... you cannot escape the chemical toxins in the air by retreating indoors, but if you stay out of the heat you are at least relieving one stress factor.<br>   An air-quality advisory is expected to remain in effect for most of southern Ontario today and into tomorrow. Conditions have worsened since this morning...<br>  It is considered to be poor in Niagara Falls, London and Sarnia.. Moderate in St. Catharines, Hamilton and Oshawa. In Toronto it swings from poor to very good.
<hr>
<b>Mars - Reaction</b><p>
<br> Well given what we are doing to our environment here on planet Earth... the latest research involving the planet Mars might be good news... there is evidence today that the red planet did in fact at one time, support life. The evidence comes from a group of NASA funded scientists... but other space scientists say no way...<br>  And as Jamie West tells us.. the issue has some theologians revisiting traditional religious thinking about life's origins...<br> 
<i><br>  We're not talking about little green men...but tiny microfossils dating back 4.5 billion years, found in a rock catapulted from Mars 16 million years ago...<br>  That landed on earth in the antarctic 13-thousand years ago...<br>  Scientists have been probing the meteorite named Allan Hills 84001 since it's discovery in 1984.<br>  Hamilton's McMaster University holds an original piece of that same meteorite.  Weighing about 30 grams it's valued at over 30-thousand dollars, and says Doug Welch it's the real thing, as are NASA's findings...<br>  
Theology professor Dr. Clark Pinnock says god might have had more going on than originally thought and he's not threatened in anyway by the findings...<br>  But even those that took part in the research are quick to point out that more work needs to be done to find a definitive answer.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Lakeswim - Update</b><p>
<br> Back on this planet... an effort to cross Lake Ontario came up a bit short. <br>  So close and yet so far... Toronto police officer John Munro had to abandon his attempt to swim across Lake Ontario because of nausea and a pain in his left shoulder. Munro's swim ended early this morning... after he battled the pain and nausea for more than four hours. He was brought to shore by his wife marathon swimmer Vicki Keith.<br>   Munro has been treated and released from hospital.<br> He says he is disappointed but he gave it his best shot... he went into the water at Niagara on the Lake and swam for twenty two hours.  He was raising money for big chill, a youth anti-violence program.
<hr>
<b>Dog Home</b><p>
 <br>  Holly the Irish Setter has limped home to an emotional reunion with her original owners. Susan Burnett of Markham says Holly, who made national headlines in a dog abuse case, sniffed through the whole house -- making sure everything was where it should be. Meanwhile, 66-year-old Maureen Cook, accused of abusing Holly by dragging her behind a car, appeared in an Orangeville court yesterday. The case was set over until September 3rd. Burnett says they decided to board Holly with Cook several months ago when their home was about to undergo renovations.
<hr>
<b>Oldest Woman</b><p>
<br>     A woman, believed to be the oldest person in the United States, has died. Mary Thompson was 120.  She had a heart attack yesterday in Orlando, Florida. Thompson credited her long life to minding her own business. She outlived two husbands and eight of her 10 children.
<hr>
<b>Health - Hidden Fat</b><p>
 Another warning about fat for you tonight...<br>   A US consumer group says the saturated fat that's listed on nutrition labels tells only part of the story.<br>   The Center For Science in the Public Interest says what the label doesn't show is the amount of so-called "trans fats."<br>   Trans fats are created when vegetable oil is hardened by a process called hydrogenation.<br>   The Centre for Science in the Public Interest claims trans fats or hydrogenated oils raise the levels of bad cholesterol in the blood -- and raise your risk of heart attack.
<hr>
<b>Jobs </b><p>
<br>     Prime minister Chretien says governments -- with their deficits -- can't be expected to bear the brunt of job creating -- but the private sector must.<br>   Chretien made his comment at the start of a two-day Liberal caucus session being held to prepare for the fall sitting of parliament.<br>   Chretien is insisting that his government has the right economic policies, especially with interest rates at a two-year low.<br> He also expects a drop in the unemployment numbers.<br>

<hr>
<b>Air Quality</b><p>
 Hot hazy humid weather has southern Ontario in it's grips for the first time this summer.<br>  There are concerns that those with breathing problems like asthma may suffer at the hands of something called photochemical smog.  The concoction is created from high levels of air pollutants mixing with bright sunshine.<br>  There is now an air quality advisory issued for most of southern Ontario and a humidex warning as temperatures begin to soar into the mid-thirties.. and in some spots in southern Ontario today, as high as forty...<br>  Medical professionals are warning that the best way to deal with the heat and smog is to stay out of it....
<hr>
<b>Olympic Athletes</b><p>
<br>  Hundreds of fans didn't let the heat stand in the way of giving Canada's Olympic rowers a hero's welcome home.<br>  They cheered heartily as gold medalists Marnie Mcbean and Kathleen Heddle, silver medalist Derek Porter and the rest of the team were introduced.<br>  Canada's rowers captured six medals at the olympics....one gold.. four silver and a bronze. It made the canadians the top rowing nation in the world.
<hr>
<b>Munro Swim</b><p>
<br>  A Toronto police officer is setting out to prove he has as much potential for marathon swimming as his wife.<br>  John Munro, the husband of Vicki Keith, is trying to swim across Lake Ontario.<br>  He's now about halfway there.<br>  Conditions are said to be good, and Munro is doing fine so far.<br>  The swim is a fundraiser for chill power, an education program aimed at preventing youth violence.<br>  Lauran Sabourin reports.
<BR>
<i>
John Munro was getting greased up by an expert.<br>  His wife Vicki Keith was helping him prepare to swim across Lake Ontario from Niagara on the Lake to Toronto.<br>

John Munro waded into the waters off Niagara on the Lake.<br>  His wife Vicki positioned in a kayak beside him. <br>  Using slow plodding strokes John Munro is heading for Vicki Keith Point near Leslie Street on the Toronto waterfront.<br>  The lake temperature is about 23 degress.<br>  The waters are calm.<br>  Munro is hoping to reach his goal sometime tomorrow morning.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Social Caseload</b><p>
<br>  Another plunge for ontario's social assistance caseload.<br>  Social Services Minister David Tsubouchi has announced more than 11-thousand people received welfare or family benefits cheques last month.<br>  That amounts to a percentage drop of about 1 per cent.<br>  Tsubouchi says the drop reflects seasonal employment changes and the effects of his government's welfare reforms.
<hr>

<b>Caribana Shooting</b><p>
<br>  Police are working on a new lead in last weekend's Caribana shooting.<br>  23 year old Elrick Christian was shot to death during a parade along toronto's waterfront.<br>  Friends of Christian say they know who the killer is, and have given police the name.<br>  No arrests have been made yet.<br>  three other people were injured, two of them seriously.
<hr>

<hr>
<b>UK Abortion</b><p>
<br>  A shocking twist to the case of a British woman carrying twins who wanted to abort one of the fetuses.<br>  Just as anti abortion groups won a court order preventing her from doing so, a hospital in London confirms the woman has already undergone the procedure.<br>  A fertility specialist says one fetus was aborted about five months ago.

<hr>
<b>TWA Crash</b><p>
<br>  Crews searching for debris from TWA flight 800 have found luggage at the bottom of the ocean, closer to New York's Kennedy Airport than the main crash site.<br>  That could add to the theory that there was an explosion in or near the jumbo jet's forward cargo hold.<br>  The plane crashed in a huge fireball July 17th after taking off for Paris.<br>  All 230 people aboard were killed.
<hr>
<b>Bosnia Agreement</b><p>

<HR>

<H3>Parrott Newser </H3>

<P>
Metro Toronto Police are doing damage control after a media feeding
frenzy on the man charged in the murder of Alison Parrott. Thirty
eight year old Francis Carl Roy is charged with first degree murder
in the rape and strangulation of the eleven year old girl, back
in July of 1986. 
<P>
The police have indicated that Roy is now being investigated for
other crimes across the country... but today the lead investigator
in the murder case, told reporters to use extreme caution when
quoting unidentified sources referring to Roy as a serial killer.

<HR>

<H3>Four Dead </H3>

<P>
A man is under police guard at a Toronto hospital after four people
were shot to death on Manitoulin Island. Police say a man first
shot 37-year-old Eugene Cada and Gloria Jean Morden, who was 34,
as the two sat in a house having coffee yesterday near Gore Bay.
A man then allegedly drove to nearby Elizabeth Bay and turned
a shotgun on Arthur and Elizabeth Long, both in their late 80s.

<P>
Forty- four-year-old Eli Nahwaikezhik is in serious but stable
condition with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. no charges have
been laid. 
<HR>

<H3>Ontario Reform </H3>

<P>
The Reform Party seems to be losing popularity in Ontario, as
is its leader Preston Manning. The latest public opinion poll
should give comfort to Ontario's Tory premier Mike Harris. 
<HR>

<H3>Doctors Off </H3>

<P>
Ontario doctors want Queen's Park to pay up for more than half
a billion dollars worth of services that exceed the health care
budget. If they don't get the money, the Ontario Medical Association
says doctors will decline more work. OMA president Gerry Rowland
says government funding fails to meet growing patient needs. 
<HR>

<H3>Ontario Embryos </H3>

<P>
There's a heated debate raging in Britain over a law that calls
for frozen human embryos to be destroyed after five years of storage...in
British fertility clinics. Some religious leaders have lashed
out at the law...saying it offers no other options for the preservation
of life... as Jamie West reports... here in Ontario ...parties
with a stake in reproductive technology have only begun to explore
the very complicated moral issues... 
<P>
<I>This was the scene yesterday in Britain, hundreds gathered
to mourn what they see as the death of tiny human beings... 3000
human embryos, each consisting of four living human cells frozen
in test tubes for the last five years with no owners to lay claim.
The law calling for their destruction unless owners come forward
to demand otherwise.</I>
<P>
<I>Prominent Hamilton doctor Carmelo Scime is active in the pro-life
movement and agrees with the condemnation ... and although Ontario
is on the leading edge of new reproductive technologies... there
are literally no laws on the books to govern the storage and handling
of frozen human embryos.</I>
<P>
<I>Another prominent Hamilton ob-gyn Dr. John Lamont, says the
British law was conceived to hastily and that Canada must continue
to gather data before jumping on the British bandwagon.</I>
<P>
<I>The Canadian National Reproductive Technologies Commission
has just completed a two volume report that the medical community
hopes politicians will consider before drafting any legislation.
</I>
<HR>

<H3>Marijuana Bust </H3>

<P>
Seven-thousand marijuana plants have been seized by the OPP near
Mount Forest. Police used chainsaws to cut down some of the huge
plants. Police also seized several guns, including a semi-automatic
rifle and cultivation equipment. 
<P>
Five suspects have been remanded in custody on drug charges. Charged
are 30-year-old Alan Whittaker of Brampton, 23-year-old Mike McGuigan
of Milton, 41-year-old William Kyle of grand valley, 30-year-old
Alan Dunnigan of Wasaga Beach and 26-year-old Elizabeth Miller.

<HR>

<H3>Aidid Dead </H3>

<P>
Somali faction leader general Mohammed Farrah Aidid has died.
His militia says he died of a heart attack yesterday after being
shot in factional fight last week. 
<P>
Thousands of weeping Somalis poured into the streets of south
Mogadishu today. 
<P>
Aidid, the self-proclaimed president of Somalia, was the target
of a manhunt by U.S. troops in 1993. He was never caught, but
18 U.S. soldiers were killed during an attack on his stronghold.

<HR>

<H3>Yeltsin Health </H3>

<P>
Russian president Boris Yeltsin needs a few months of peace and
quiet. A top Kremlin aide says he's suffering from &quot;colossal
weariness&quot; from the recent election. 
<P>
The 65-year-old Yeltsin, who had two heart attacks last year,
moved into a sanitarium outside Moscow in mid-July. But his aide
denies he's suffered a recurrence of heart trouble. 
<HR>

<H3>Truck Penalty </H3>

<P>
A Montreal trucking company has been handed a light penalty for
a toxic spill that caused one of Ontario's worst traffic snarls.
Provost Bulk Transport will be prohibited from operating part
of its fleet in Ontario for 10 days. 
<P>
In June of last year, a tanker toppled over on Highway 401 in
Toronto, spilling potentially explosive liquid. The accident happened
during morning rush-hour and closed part of the busy highway for
six hours. The Transportation Ministry was seeking a tougher penalty.

<HR>

<H3>Economy Poll </H3>

<P>
A new poll suggests Canadians think better economic times are
just around the bend. An Angus Reid poll finds optimism has risen
significantly since January, with 75 per cent of those asked expecting
the economy will stay the same or improve in the coming year.

<P>
Quebecers are the most gloomy about their provincial economy --
they have been since the October referendum. Other Canadians say
they're perking up, with one in three respondents seeing better
times.

<H3>Environment Regulations </H3>

<P>
An Environment Ministry report released today is recommending
big changes to environmental protection rules in Ontario. The

<P>
Although the government insists the changes won't hurt the environment,
environmental groups think otherwise. 
<HR>

<H3>Kitchener Doctors </H3>

<P>
Nine surgeons in Kitchener- Waterloo took the day off to protest
the closure this week of operating rooms at both the Kitchener-
Waterloo Health Centre and St. Mary's Hospital. Only emergency
cases were being taken.

<HR>

<H3>407 - Toll Road </H3>

<P>
Phase one of Canada's first privately managed toll highway will
open before the end of the year; but will there be enough users
to pay for the one billion dollar cost? Critics of the all-electronic
toll highway say taxpayers might not recover their money because
of a lack of information about how to use the new highway. George
Szostak has more. 
<P>
<I>Stressful traffic congestion on Canada's busiest highway, the
401 near Pearson Airport. Ontario's answer to avoid or reduce
heavy traffic flows on the 401 is the 407 express toll route;
Canada's first all electronic toll highway that will be managed
by a private company. </I>
<P>
<I>Six lanes of white concrete will span 62 kilometres north of
the 401 from Oakville to Scarborough. Video cameras will photograph
each license plate and the driver will be sent a bill. Frequent
users can get a transponder for their vehicle for electronic tracking.
</I>
<P>
<I>The first phase of Highway 407 will run 36 kilometres from
Brampton to Markham. That's scheduled to open by the end of the
year. </I>
<HR>

<P>
The Liberals still lead with 57 per cent support among those questioned.

<HR>

<H3>Reform Back </H3>

<P>
The results come as Reform tries to put to rest, the controversy
over remarks made by members Dave Chatters and Bob Ringma about
homosexuals and visible minorities. Reform held a mid-summer caucus
session today. 
<HR>

<H3>Casino Opens </H3>

<P>
Canada's biggest native- run casino opened near Orillia today.
This after a judge made a crucial decision affecting the distribution
of profits. The province has been ordered to give Metis and non-status
Indians a share of the 100-million dollars a year in expected
profits from the casino. Originally, the money was to be shared
by the province and aboriginal bands recognized by Ottawa.

<H3>Hospitals Re: Doctors </H3>

<P>
First it was the obstetricians refusing to accept new patients.
Now it's orthopedic surgeons who are threatening to strike. This
evening Niagara residents are being warned that beginning September
1st because of a dispute with the government over fees they may
have to cross the border to get treatment for broken and fractured
bones, because specialists in the peninsula are walking off the
job. Lauran Sabourin has the details. 
<P>
<I>On a normal day staff in the St. Catharines General emergency
room don't' have a moment to rest. 62 percent of the cases that
come through the emergency are broken and fractured bones. Cases
looked after by orthopedic specialists. But because of a dispute
over fee clawbacks with the government the orthopedic surgeons
in Niagara are threatening to strike. </I>
<P>
<I>What hospital administrators and doctors at St. Catharines
General are predicting is that patients will be stabilized in
emergency. But may have to be transported by ambulance to hospitals
in New York state. But if the doctors do refuse to care for patients
they admit they will be hurt.</I>
<P>
<I>Waits will be longer in the emergency room for everyone. Patients
with broken and fractured bones could be traveling miles by ambulance,
waiting hours for treatment. But the doctors who support the strike
action recount just how much money they are losing because of
government cutbacks.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Irving Up </H3>

<P>
Canada's environment minister toured the Irving Whale site today.
Sergio Marchi says he's relieved that an environmental threat
is being looked after. 
<P>
The barge was carrying oil and PCBs when it sank in 1970 north
of Prince Edward Island. The Irving whale was raised from the
floor of the gulf of St. Lawrence to the surface of the water
this morning. 
<HR>

<H3>Crime Statistics </H3>

<P>
Thunder Bay has the highest violent crime rate among major cities
in Ontario. Statistics Canada based the 1995 violent crime rates
for Canadian cities on criminal code incidents per 100 thousand
people. 
<P>
The 1995 rate in Thunder Bay was just over 18-hundred incidents
per 100-thousand people -- but it was down 6.5 per cent from 1994.
Hamilton was next, followed by Sudbury, Ottawa and London. 
<P>
Toronto placed sixth among nine Ontario cities in terms of violent
crime rates. 
<HR>

<H3>G7 Meet </H3>

<P>
Major industrialized countries have agreed &quot;to close ranks
against terrorism.&quot; Foreign and security ministers from the
G-7 countries and Russia have agreed to a set of concrete measures
to fight terrorist activity. A key promise involves finding ways
to share information that could uncover planned terrorist attacks
before they take place. 
<HR>

<H3>Olympic Park </H3>

<P>
A ten-minute delay is under the microscope tonight. Officials
are piecing together the minutes leading up to Saturday's Olympic
bombing in Atlanta. A source says emergency operators took ten
minutes to find the address of Centennial Park, after receiving
a call warning of a bomb. All of this as the park re-opened today.

<HR>

<H3>TWA Update </H3>

<P>
Off Long Island, New York, recovery teams are focusing on the
front section of TWA flight 800. While recovery of bodies remains
the top priority ... officials are pressing ahead with efforts
to determine what caused the jetliner to explode, killing all
230 aboard. 
<HR>

<H3>Drowning </H3>

<P>
An afternoon swim in Mississauga turned tragic yesterday when
a teenage girl drowned after jumping into the Credit River to
help her 11-year-old brother. 
<P>
13-year- old Annie Fernandez was jumping off a railway trestle
with her brother and a friend when it appeared her brother was
in trouble. She jumped in, but never surfaced. Divers recovered
the girl's body a couple of hours later. 
<HR>

<H3>Hwy. 427 Crash </H3>

<P>
The southbound express lanes of highway 427 in west end Toronto
have been reopened after a serious traffic accident. Two tractor
trailers collided around 4:30 this morning. One trucker is in
critical condition in hospital. 
<P>
The transfer lanes from the southbound collector lanes to the
express lanes remained closed... but are due to re-open any time
now. 
<HR>

<H3>Roof Collapse </H3>

<P>
Heavy rain overnight is being blamed for the collapse of a roof
on a Cambridge apartment building. Fourteen apartments in the
building were evacuated. Police say one person was shaken up by
the incident and taken to hospital for treatment. 
<P>
The overnight storms also caused flooding in low-lying areas in
several communities including parts of the Toronto area. 
<HR>

<H3>Consumers Woes </H3>

<P>
The Consumers Distributing chain of retail stores is closing a
large number of its outlets across the country, and is looking
for new money to bail it out of a financial crunch. 
<HR>

<H3>Casino Advance </H3>

<P>
The Orillia area is looking more and more like Las Vegas. There
was a glittering sneak preview of Casino Rama last night for seven
thousand invited guests. 
<P>
Trade minister bill Saunderson, who was on hand for the festivities,
said the casino development will provide direct and indirect jobs
for six thousand people. 
<P>
Casino Rama has two thousand slot machines along with blackjack
tables, roulette wheels, and poker tables. It opens to the public
tomorrow.

<HR>

<H3>Atlanta Blast </H3>

<P>
The spirit of the Olympics has been untouched by the bombing at
the Atlanta games over the weekend .. but the attention of the
political world is focused on terrorism. 
<P>
First, the latest on the bombing... Atlanta officials say they
are closing in on a suspect in the blast at a concert early Saturday
morning in Olympic village... and tomorrow they will re-open Centennial
Park where the bombing happened, with a memorial service to the
one dead and scores injured. 
<HR>

<H3>TWA Update </H3>

<P>
And investigators say a key piece of metal could prove a theory
that TWA flight 800 was destroyed by a bomb. A source close to
the investigation says a piece of the plane's aluminum coating
close to the explosion would probably tell what caused the blast.
They believe the plane was severed in two between the first class
and coach cabins by a bomb, possibly being carried in the front
cargo hold. 
<P>
The search is focusing on a debris field about 30 metres below
the Atlantic where the first wreckage settled. Searchers are working
around the clock. 
<HR>

<H3>Terrorist Meet </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. president Clinton is looking for a freer hand
in fighting terrorism... today he called together congressional
leaders to consider several ideas, including expanded wiretapping
and putting chemical tracers in gunpowder... tomorrow.. the fight
against terrorism will be on the global agenda as ministers for
the G-7 Nations gather in Paris. 
<P>
The meeting was called before the explosion on board TWA flight
eight hundred and the Atlanta games blast, but the two events
have added a renewed sense of urgency to the talks. 
<HR>

<H3>Doggy Dragged </H3>

<P>
A story that has shocked and sickened people throughout the province
today... an elderly Shelburne area woman has now been charged
after she tied her three year old Irish Setter to the back bumper
of her car and dragged the dog for half a kilometre along a gravel
road ... she then took the badly injured dog to the vet for treatment.

<P>
Initially the SPCA said they would have to let the woman keep
the dog... but now officials say if they can prove that she is
unfit to care for the dog, then they can take the animal away.
The SPCA will keep the dog until court proceedings against the
woman are complete. 
<P>
The act of cruelty against the dog was, according to its owner,
to teach it a lesson, for leaving the yard. 
<HR>

<H3>Scarborough Murder </H3>

<P>
A Toronto woman is dead and her common law husband in jail ...
the thirty nine year old victim was found early this morning in
a house in the Brimley and Kingston Road area of Scarborough.

<P>
Thirty five year old Thomas Brennan is charged with second degree
murder. Police are asking for the public's help in determining
Brennan's actions leading up to the murder. 
<HR>

<H3>Churchill Crash </H3>

<P>
Dental records will be needed to identify a person who died in
a fiery head-on crash in Mississauga today. Two cars collided
along Winston Churchill Boulevard near highway 401, causing one
car to flip on to its roof and burst into flames. The accident
happened around 3:00 a-m. 
<P>
It's believed the person who died was a woman. One person in the
other car suffered injuries described as non-life- threatening.

<P>
So far this year, 21 people have died in traffic accidents in
Peel Region -- the same number of fatalities for all of last year.

<HR>

<H3>Parachute Down </H3>

<P>
There were two fatal skydiving accidents this past weekend. A
40 year old aurora man fell more than 15-hundred metres to his
death Sunday near Baldwin, south of Lake Simcoe. Neil Montgomery
was an experienced skydiver, but his parachute did not open. 
<P>
And on Saturday, a parachuting instructor in Quebec died after
colliding with another skydiver during a formation jump. 
<HR>

<H3>Heart Study </H3>

<P>
There is more evidence tonight that women are every bit as predisposed
to heart disease as their male counterparts. A recent study conducted
at Toronto's Women's College Hospital disproves the traditional
theory that women just don't get coronary artery disease.... and
as Jamie West reports tonight heart disease for both men and women
is the number one killer in north America... 
<P>
<I>The five year study of 167 women and 348 men found that female
patients developed coronary artery disease to a greater extent
and at a younger age than previously thought. </I>
<P>
<I>Cardiac surgeon Dr. Stephanie Brister performs hundreds of
coronary by-pass operations each year at Hamilton General Hospital.
A third of her patients are women. </I>
<P>
<I>And so the medical community says Brister is working and has
been working to ensure proper diagnostic techniques are developed
for women. To Dr. Brister the results of the Women's College Hospital
study come as no surprise but... conventional thinking women were
protected for life from heart disease by the female hormone estrogen,
has proven to be wrong. Younger women in their late 40's and early
fifties are having heart attacks and occasionally the classic
symptoms of crushing chest pain and jaw numbness are present...
and if you feel the symptoms the advice is to speak up... </I>
<HR>

<H3>Dirty Dancing </H3>

<P>
The courts have declared illegal. Bylaws have banned it. But lap
dancing is again slowly grinding its way into strip bars across
metro Toronto and other communities in Ontario. 
<HR>

<H3>Food Banks </H3>

<P>
The largest ever food drive in Ontario was kicked off this afternoon.
Nearly 200 Ontario food banks have joined forces for a co-ordinated
two-week effort starting today. 
<P>
The summertime food drive was first held last year... and organizers
say the reason is simple...- rapidly falling food supplies. At
the current rate of usage, 110 food banks could run out of food
some time in August. 
<P>
Also, an internal food drive by Hamilton firefighters is going
public this week. Food can be dropped off at Hamilton firehalls
until Sunday. 
<HR>

<H3>Highway 407 </H3>

<P>
Commuters stuck on the 401 highway north of Toronto each day could
have some relief by the end of the year. That's when the first
phase of highway 407 is due for completion. The new toll superhighway
will link highway 410 in Brampton to highway 404 in Markham. 
<P>
By 1998 the highway will link highway 403 in Oakville to highway
48 in Markham. New electronic technology will be used to collect
the tolls.

<H3>Hijacking </H3>

<P>
The hijacking of a Spanish airliner is over. A police spokesman
says the lone hijacker surrendered and was taken into custody
by the FBI at the Miami International Airport. 
<P>
The Iberia Airlines jet -- with 231 people aboard -- was hijacked
by a man claiming to have a bomb after leaving Madrid on a flight
to Cuba. 
<HR>

<H3>TWA </H3>

<P>
Investigators call it an &quot;extraordinarily important&quot;
find. Search crews have found two of the four engines from TWA
flight 800 on the ocean floor, off New York. They could provide
crucial physical evidence of what happened. 
<P>
All 230 people aboard the plane were killed when it exploded after
taking off from New York's Kennedy International Airport last
week. 
<HR>

<H3>CAA Photo Radar </H3>

<P>
The Canadian Automobile Association is calling on Queen's Park
to bring back photo radar if speed limits go up. The provincial
Tories have indicated they're looking into raising speeds to 120
kilometres an hour on the 400 series highways. The auto club says
there should be zero-tolerance of anyone exceeding that limit.
As Dwight Ryan reports, drivers have varied views on the subject.

<P>
<I>Ontarians either loved it or hated it. Photo radar was one
of the most controversial programs introduced by the New Democrats
during their term in office at Queen's Park. Detractors called
it a cash cow. And the provincial Tories saw it as an election
issue. When the Progressive Conservative's steamrolled into the
Ontario legislature with a majority.. photo radar was mothballed.
</I>
<P>
<I>At this roadside service centre in Grimsby drivers have mixed
views. Even truckers can't agree on what's best for road safety.
The Progressive Conservatives will take another look at increasing
speed limits when the legislature resumes in the fall. </I>
<HR>

<H3>HTA Changes </H3>

<P>
A conservative MPP is going to war, not only with drunk drivers,
but also with passengers who ride beside them. Jim Brown the Tory
member for Scarborough west, plans to bring in a private members
bill that would penalize both the driver and passengers. 
<HR>

<H3>Karla Parole </H3>

<P>
The woman who was convicted in the sex slayings of teens Kristen
French and Leslie Mahaffy could be out on the street as early
as next year. Prison sources say Karla Homolka is a model inmate
and could be granted day parole early next year, and full parole
by the summer. 
<P>
Homolka is serving a 12 year sentence for her part in the murders.
And although she will be eligible for early parole, parole board
officials are expected to be under pressure from the victim's
families and the public to keep her behind bars for her full sentence.

<HR>

<H3>Medical Spinal </H3>

<P>
A new report out this morning is providing some hope for those
suffering from paralysis. Many could one day walk again. As researchers
target regeneration and repair of spinal cord injuries. 
<HR>

<H3>Twoonie Theft </H3>

<P>
Thieves in Montreal have made off with three-million dollars worth
of two-dollar coins. They stole a tractor-trailer filled with
boxes of the coins from a CN Railway yard last Saturday but Montreal
police delayed releasing details of the heist. 
<P>
The coins had just arrived in Montreal from the Royal Canadian
Mint in Winnipeg. CN Rail police say security was tight and they
have no idea how the thieves made off with the coins.

<H3>Ontario Quakes </H3>

<P>
We may have thought we were immune to natural disasters but new
evidence tonight shows otherwise. A group of scientists says southern
Ontario could be a prime candidate for a major earthquake. The
evidence comes after three research dives on the bottom of Lake
Ontario. 
<HR>

<H3>Baby Custody </H3>

<P>
A legal battle is brewing over custody of an eight-week old Ottawa-area
baby born with a pellet lodged in his brain. The baby was released
from hospital yesterday in good condition. He is under the care
of the Children's Aid Society. But his family has now decided
to seek custody of the infant at a hearing next Wednesday in Smiths
Falls. 
<P>
The baby's mother is accused of trying to kill her son with a
pellet gun on May 28th, two days before she gave birth. 28 year-old
Brenda Drummond is charged with attempted murder. 
<HR>

<H3>Grade 13 </H3>

<P>
Ontario's secondary school system will remain a five-year plan
a little while longer. Plans to get rid of grade 13 have been
pushed back from September 1997 to 1998. 
<P>
Education minister John Snobelen says more consultation is needed
before the four-year plan is phased in. Ontario is the only province
with grade 13. 
<HR>

<H3>Palladini - Aggregates</H3>

<P>
It was seven years ago that sand and gravel truckers staged a
noisy demonstration outside the Ontario legislature. The liberal
government bought their argument that they were being harassed
by transportation ministry officials over weight restrictions.
...and placed a moratorium on enforcement of the weight rules.
But the party's over, and aggregate truckers will now face tough
new rules. Dwight Ryan has the story. 
<P>
<I>Ontario transportation minister Al Palladini is heralding a
new partnership between Queen's Park and truckers hauling aggregates
that will help maintain our roads. Again sand and gravel truck
drivers will have to meet maximum weight limits with evenly distributed
loads. </I>
<P>
<I>A moratorium on enforcement has been in place since the truckers
circled Queens Park seven years ago. They convinced the former
liberal government that they were being treated unfairly. But
Palladini says our roads have been suffering now for too long.
</I>
<P>
<I>While the trucking industry is being praised for helping shape
the new rules, ministry officials are busy convincing drivers
that reduced loads and more paperwork are in their best interest...
Woodbridge trucker Bruno Bartucci says complying with the new
rules will be difficult. </I>
<P>
<I>A new enforcement unit armed with computerized equipment will
carefully monitor the haulers. But Palladini says his officials
will be patient. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Flight Recorders </H3>

<P>
In world news tonight, investigators are said to have found nothing
unusual on the flight and data recorders from TWA flight 800.

<P>
CNN reports, officials have listened, at least once, to the cockpit
voice recorder and have looked at the readout from the flight
data recorder. The absence of anything unusual on the recorders
could indicate an explosion aboard that knocked out the devices.
But investigators say a detailed examination of the recorders
is needed before any conclusions can be drawn. 
<HR>

<H3>Clinton Security </H3>

<P>
Airline security meanwhile, is getting tougher in the US. US president
Bill Clinton has announced that airlines will search more baggage
by hand. There will also be pre-flight inspections of every plane
flying to and from the United States. 
<HR>

<H3>Burundi Coup </H3>

<P>
Burundi's military has seized power in the central African country.
A military spokesman says the coalition government headed by an
ethnic Hutu has been overthrown. The newly installed president
is a member of the rival Tutsis. The two groups have waged a civil
war in recent years that has claimed more than 150-thousand lives.

<HR>

<H3>Boat Search </H3>

<P>
An extensive air and water search was called off late today for
a group of teenagers, who are believed to have stolen a row boat
last night, from a beach in east Toronto. 
<P>
Police say the search will not resume until there is more positive
evidence that they are still out on the lake. 
<HR>

<H3>Domestic Abuse </H3>

<P>
Toronto's crown prosecutors want to establish a separate courtroom
to deal with what they call the ``epidemic'' of people accused
of battering their partners. In a memo obtained by the Toronto
star, the prosecutors urge their boss to push for a pilot project
that would see significant changes to the way domestic assault
cases are tried. Those changes include the separate courtroom
along with special training for both police and crown attorneys
so they could better prosecute the alleged assailants. 
<P>
If approved by Toronto's top judges, the court would begin trying
cases in September. The pilot project would then be reviewed after
one year. 
<HR>

<H3>MPs - Cuba </H3>

<P>
If the Helms-Burton Law is an excellent piece of international
legislation, then so is the Godfrey-Milliken law. So say two liberal
members of parliament who plan to introduce a private members
bill that parallels the U.S. anti-Cuba legislation. 
<P>
But as Dwight Ryan reports, the two government members made their
announcement with their tongues planted firmly in their cheeks.

<P>
<I>U.S. president Clinton fired the first volley when he signed
into law the Helms-Burton Act. Companies doing business with Cuba
could be punished by the U.S. executives of those companies and
their families could be banned from visiting America. </I>
<P>
<I>Now Canada's fighting back. At least two liberal MP's are.
John Godfrey, and Peter Milliken, both descendants of United Empire
Loyalists, are about to introduce a private members bill that
parallels the Helms-Burton Act. The renegade MP's say restitution
would be in the billions. Each claims ownership of a property
in the U.S. and they want them back. </I>
<P>
<I>The government members say if the Helms-Burton law is a great
piece of international legislation, then so is the Godfrey-Burton
law. Author- historian Christopher Moore helped draft the Godfrey
Burton law. They'll introduce their bill in September. </I>
<P>
Indiana republican Dan Burton, a co-author of the Helms-Burton
law, said the Canadian MP's plan isn't worth responding to. Senator
Jesse Helms refused to comment.

<H3>Economy - Interest </H3>

<P>
We're on the road to recovery. Canada's economy is set for a turnaround.
We've heard it all before, but federal government figures once
again show that our limp economy could pick up the pace in the
coming months. 
<P>
For the ninth month in a row, the federal government's economic
barometer.. the composite leading index.. has risen. And interest
rates are falling as the feds try to get us to spend our money.
As Dwight Ryan reports, the plan appears to be working. 
<P>
<I>Mark Debruyn-Smith is having a great year. The Hamilton real
estate agent has sold more houses so far this year than any other
year. He says buyers, particularly first time buyers have waited
long enough. Housing sales throughout southern Ontario are on
the increase. New housing starts are beginning to recover from
their lowest point in 35 years. </I>
<P>
<I>Despite double-digit unemployment, consumer confidence is increasing.
The Bank of Canada's plan to spur the economy with lower rates
appears to be working. At 4.75 percent, the central rate is now
at its lowest point in two and a half years. Chartered banks have
lowered their prime by another quarter point and mortgage rates
are falling. </I>
<P>
<I>Economists feel the low interest rate policy will soon pay
off. Its a view shared by Warren Jestin, chief economist of Scotiabank.
</I>
<P>
<I>In the meantime, the retail sector waits for recovery. So does
the auto industry where sales continue to lag. Mark Debruyn- Smith,
meanwhile, hopes the resale housing boom he's experiencing will
continue. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Wallaceburg Hostage </H3>

<P>
Police have seized two air rifles from a house in Wallaceburg
where a little girl was held hostage. The six year old girl, was
held against her will for several hours yesterday morning, before
being released around 8:30 a-m. A man was arrested around noon.

<P>
29 year-old Alan Chauvin of Wallaceburg is charged with 12 offenses,
including forcible confinement and assault with a weapon. 
<HR>

<H3>Oshawa Rape</H3>

<P>
A man from Oshawa showed little emotion today as he appeared in
court on charges in the rape and beating of a 14-year-old girl.
The girl was sexually assaulted, severely beaten and left along
railway tracks on July 14th. 
<P>
20 year-old Michael Kobylanski is charged with aggravated sexual
assault and aggravated assault. Kobylanski was remanded in custody
until his next court appearance July 30th. 
<HR>

<H3>Day Care Woes </H3>

<P>
A survey by child care advocates, warns that thousands of day
care spaces in Ontario have disappeared, since the Harris government
came to power. And according to the survey, the reason for the
decline in spaces is cuts in transfer payments to municipalities.
<HR>

<H3>Ottawa - Wildlife </H3>

<P>
The World Wildlife Fund is going to court to try to slow down
the development of a diamond mine in the northwest territories.
The conservationists want a federal judge to review plans for
the mine. They say a federal environmental panel that approved
the plan, failed to look at all the issues. 
<P>
Fund spokesman Kevin MacNamee says the federal panel should have
made sure that arctic wilderness areas would be protected. 
<HR>

<H3>Licence Plates </H3>

<P>
Ontario car owners can now get five new types of licence plates
to show the world where their loyalties lie. The new plates sport
logos of Ontario's pro-sport teams such as the Toronto Blue Jays,
the Maple Leafs and the Hamilton Tigercats... Scouts Canada, the
Ontario Lacrosse Association, and Sir Wilfrid Laurier University.

<P>
Graphic plates cost 50-dollars over and above the regular plate
price, with personalized plates going for 175 dollars. Two dollars
from the sale of each plate will go to the organization whose
logo is featured. 
<HR>

<H3>Olympics </H3>

<P>
As we mentioned earlier, the latest numbers from Statistics Canada
suggest Canada's economy is continuing to improve. Well, in Atlanta,
merchants had predicted a boom in their economy, thanks to the
summer Olympics. However, the much anticipated economic boost
has gone bust.

<H3>Que. Flood </H3>

<P>
Residents of the flood-stricken Saguenay region of Quebec are
trying to put their lives back in order. At least eight people
were killed in flash floods over the weekend. 
<P>
Major Pierre Bettez of CFB Bagotville says it's hoped the worst
is over. Bettez says they're now working on reuniting people who
got separated during the evacuation operation. 
<P>
Damage from the flooding is estimated in the millions of dollars.

<HR>

<H3>Welland Re: Flood </H3>

<P>
Seven people are dead. Seven thousand were evacuated as a result
of the flash floods that ravaged the Saguenay region of Quebec
this weekend. While relief flood relief efforts in Ontario are
still being organized, Francophone communities in the province
are watching the graphic pictures of the devastation with anxiety.
<HR>

<H3>Drummond </H3>

<P>
The case of an Ottawa-area woman accused of trying to kill her
unborn son with a pellet gun, returns to court September 16th.

<P>
In court today, the lawyer for Brenda Drummond argued the case
should be dismissed because a fetus is not a human being. Lawrence
Greenspon added Drummond is being treated for depression in hospital.

<P>
Drummond's baby Johnathon was born May 30th with a lead pellet
lodged in his brain. He's in stable condition in hospital after
having the pellet removed. 
<HR>

<H3>Brighton Crash </H3>

<P>
The Transportation Safety Board today issued a report on the November
1994 Via Rail train derailment near Brighton. It says rail passengers
in Canada have been exposed unnecessarily to risks, particularly
in emergency situations. It notes passengers in the Brighton derailment
had to flee the train &quot;under life-threatening conditions.&quot;
It also says the rail, laid across the track by vandals, which
caused the derailment, wouldn't have been there if work crews
hadn't left it behind. 
<P>
The board is calling on Transport Canada to design federal standards
for emergency operations. 
<HR>

<H3>Holiday-Liquor </H3>

<P>
It'll be a lot easier to buy beer, wine or liquor on the August
fifth civic holiday. Three times the number of beer and liquor
stores will be open on the holiday Monday than last year. 
<HR>

<H3>Pakistan Air Bomb </H3>

<P>
In world news tonight, police say the death toll has risen to
nine, in a bombing at the international airport in Lahore, Pakistan.
A report says the bomb exploded near a lounge at the airport.
The bomb blew up as Pakistan International Airlines flight 315
was leaving for the southern port city of Karachi. Police say
it may have been intended for that plane. 
<HR>

<H3>TWA Update </H3>

<P>
New York's governor says the searchers off the coast of Long Island
have made a significant find. He says they've found a large piece
of the wreckage of TWA flight 800. 
<P>
George Pataki also says the bodies of additional victims of the
air disaster have been found. His comments came at the end of
a memorial service on the Long Island shore near the site of the
crash. 
<HR>

<H3>O'Hare Bomb </H3>

<P>
Chicago authorities are investigating a security breach at O'Hare
International Airport. Someone managed to place a small, explosive
device right out on the tarmac last night.  Some anonymous phone
calls had airport officials and passengers on edge. 
<HR>

<H3>Olympic Transit </H3>

<P>
Running smoothly is an Olympic dream for a supervisor with the
Hamilton Street Railway. 34 year old Jim Dahms has spent nearly
a year helping to design the transit system in Atlanta for the
96 summer games. 
<P>
It's been his responsibility to set up schedules for the 3-thousand
drivers who'll be carting visitors to their Olympic destination.
But despite all the planning and scheduling, transit in Atlanta
has hit a snag.

<HR>

<H3>TWA </H3>

<P>
Sources are now quoted as saying it was -- in all likelihood --
a bomb. CBS and CNN report the probe of the TWA explosion off
Long Island, New York, will be handed over to criminal investigators
later today. The networks say sources indicate that &quot;any
possible mechanical malfunction or meltdown&quot; has been virtually
eliminated. 
<P>
All 230 people aboard TWA flight-800 were killed when the plane
exploded, sending debris and bodies into the Atlantic Wednesday
night. 
<HR>

<H3>Suicide Study </H3>

<P>
A crown prosecutor says the first Canadian doctor to be charged
with assisting a suicide could go to trial this fall. 
<P>
AIDS specialist Maurice Generics is charged in connection with
the April suicide of a 31-year-old Toronto man. 
<P>
Meanwhile, a Toronto mother has raised one million dollars to
conduct a study of suicide.
<HR>

<H3>Olympic Wrap </H3>

<P>
Security is tight for tonight's opening Olympic ceremonies in
Atlanta. Organizers are using 30-thousand police officers, soldiers
and private security guards. And security measures increased yesterday
at the city's main airport, after the TWA disaster. 
<P>
Prime minister Chretien will have lunch with some of the Canadian
athletes today and attend tonight's gala opening, which is being
televised around the world. 
<HR>

<H3>Salmon Fishery </H3>

<P>
The annual Chinook Classic Salmon Derby gets underway on Lake
Ontario tomorrow. Anglers will compete for over 40-thousand dollars
in prizes over the next two weeks. 
<P>
As Jamie west reports tonight ...the big lunkers are becoming
harder to find, and that's putting the pinch on charter boat operators
who say provincial cutbacks are partially to blame... 
<P>
<I>Mike Dumenil operates his fishing charter business out fifty
point marina.... his competitor Dan Smith is along for the ride.
</I>
<P>
<I>Over the last decade the Ontario government has reduced it's
stocks of Chinook salmon...Lake Ontario's biggest draw for anglers
and of course money maker for charter businesses. Another problem
is the number of lamprey eels depleting fish stocks...again there
have been cutbacks to a plan to get rid of them. </I>
<P>
<I>So now an electronic fish finder is the captain's first mate
in efforts to keep clients happy. These operators admit a slow
spring has set the season back by about three weeks but they're
optimistic the 40-thousand dollar Derby will still be a success.</I>

<HR>

<H3>TWA </H3>

<P>
A major U.S. network says investigators are looking at the possibility
a small missile might have blasted TWA flight 800 from the air.
The report is from ABC News. 
<P>
The network says two things suggest the possibility of a missile,
reports from eye-witnesses who described something looking like
a flare heading towards the plane before it exploded, and word
that a major Arabic newspaper received a warning of an attack
on an American target about the time the Boeing 7-47 exploded
into a fireball off Long Island last night, shortly after takeoff.

<HR>

<H3>Doc-Patient Roster </H3>

<P>
Ontario could be on the threshold of a new form of health care,
where patients may have to sign contracts with a family doctor,
in exchange for better medical service. 
<P>
One of the by-products of such a system would be the virtual elimination
of doctor shopping&quot; by patients. 
<HR>

<H3>Murray Tapes </H3>

<P>
It will be a few more months before provincial police wind up
their investigation into lawyer Ken Murray's handling of the Paul
Bernardo videotapes. 
<P>
OPP detective superintendent Wayne Frechette says once the probe
is completed this fall, a report will be handed to the attorney-general
who will determine if charges will be laid. 
<P>
Investigators are trying to determine if Murray, who was Bernardo's
lawyer, withheld evidence by not turning over the crucial tapes
for 15 months. The tapes played a key role in Bernardo's conviction
in two sex-killings. 
<P>
Murray denies any wrongdoing and says he is being made a scapegoat
for police mistakes. 
<HR>

<H3>Bureaucracy War </H3>

<P>
The Harris government has embarked on a plan, which it hopes will
limit the maze of government regulations that business has to
wade through, in order to operate. 
<P>
A set of guidelines approved by cabinet, would require bureaucrats
proposing new regulations, to fill out an eight page form. The
form asks whether alternatives were fully explored, whether cost-benefits
were analyzed and whether interested parties had been consulted.

<P>
The new system which goes into effect Monday, would make it harder
for regulation-happy bureaucrats to get their raft of red tape
approved by cabinet. 
<HR>

<H3>Kennedy </H3>

<P>
The race to succeed Ontario Liberal leader Lyn McLeod is in full
swing with the entry this week of Gerrard Kennedy. Kennedy, a
former food bank director, officially launched his leadership
bid Tuesday. 
<P>
He and caucus colleague Dwight Duncan from Windsor, are considered
front-runners in the race to replace Lyn McLeod. 
<P>
The party's leadership convention will be held November 30th in
Toronto.

<H3>Hepatitis B </H3>

<P>
Health officials say there is little danger that a Hepatitis-B
outbreak in the Toronto area, will spread to other areas of Ontario.
But to be on the safe side, the Harris government plans to introduce
a province-wide Hepatitis-B vaccination program soon. 
<HR>

<H3>Child Rapist </H3>

<P>
A 13-year-old girl who says she was gang raped by four boys, broke
down on the witness stand at a Toronto trial. 
<P>
Testifying in a barely audible voice, the girl told the court
how the boys held her down during the attack in mid-May. She kept
telling them she wanted to go home. 
<P>
Two boys, aged 13 and 15, are on trial in youth court. Two other
boys, 10 and 11, are too young to be charged. The trial has been
adjourned until August. 
<HR>

<H3>Police Lawsuit </H3>

<P>
Toronto police are being sued by the family of a man who was shot
and killed by officers last month. The parents of Wayne Williams
also want a judge to force officers involved in the shooting,
to co-operate with the special investigations unit. 
<P>
The 24-year-old man was killed after officers responded to complaints
a man was smashing car windows. The officers have not spoken to
investigators and only recently handed over their notes. 
<HR>

<H3>Homeless Demo </H3>

<P>
&quot;We told you so&quot;. That to the larger extent was the
message today from a group that calls itself the &quot;Bread Not
Circuses Coalition&quot;. 
<P>
The group held a news conference outside coroners court in Toronto,
where an inquest into the deaths of three homeless people is being
conducted. Coalition members say they were right in 1990, when
they predicted that homeless people would be mistreated had Toronto
succeeded in its bid to host this year's Olympics... they were
right, because that's what's happening south of the border. 
<P>
Many supporters of Toronto's Olympic bid blame the Bread Not Circuses
Coalition for the bid's failure. 
<HR>

<H3>Snobelen Panel </H3>

<P>
Education minister John Snobelen says Ontario may allow private
universities to grant degrees. Snobelen has set up a five-member
panel to examine the idea, which he says could help solve the
problem of too few spaces for a growing number of students. 
<P>
Other options the panel will consider, linking tuition to potential
earnings and encouraging partnerships between business and post
secondary institutions. 
<P>
The panel plans to hold a series of public hearings into the proposals
in September and October. 
<HR>

<H3>Canadian military </H3>

<P>
There are disturbing allegations tonight that Canadian peacekeepers
in Bosnia beat mental patients, held wild parties with nurses
and sold goods on the black market. 
<P>
Lieutenant-General Maurice (bah-reel) has called a military board
of inquiry into the incidents -- and vows any officers involved
will face disciplinary action. The alleged misconduct occurred
during 1993 and 1994, and involved members of the 12th armored
regiment, based at Valcartier, near Quebec city. 
<HR>

<H3>Saudi U.S. </H3>

<P>
American troops in Saudi Arabia face a &quot;very intense threat&quot;
from terrorists. And defence secretary William Perry says the
threat includes a possible attack with chemical or biological
weapons. The heightened alarm over terrorist threats may force
the U.S. military to move up to four-thousand of the American
troops now stationed in Saudi Arabia. 
<HR>

<H3>R. Downey Arrest </H3>

<P>
Actor Robert Downey Junior is in trouble with the law again. Just
hours after getting slapped with drug charges, he was found passed
out in a stranger's house in California. 
<P>
The 31 year old Downey has been booked for investigation of trespassing
and being under the influence of drugs. 
<HR>

<H3>Stallone Shooting </H3>

<P>
Police call it a case of guard-versus -guard at Sylvester Stallone's
Miami estate. One security guard is in critical condition after
being shot and stabbed in a clash early today. Investigators say
he was hurt when he foiled a break-in by a second guard.

<HR>

<H3>Great Lakes Quality </H3>

<P>
A warning tonight on the effort to clean up the great lakes. An
environment report states that government cut-backs, could seriously
affect the research and clean up of the international waterway.

<HR>

<H3>Cuba Decision </H3>

<P>
Canadian companies that do business in Cuba have escaped the immediate
threat of lawsuits from Americans disenfranchised during the Cuban
revolution nearly forty years ago. 
<P>
Today, U.S. president Bill Clinton agreed to let the lawsuit provisions
of the Helms-Burton act become law. But at the same time, he imposed
a six-month moratorium on the ability of Americans to actually
file lawsuits in U.S. courts. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>At stake is the fate of nearly six-thousand American-owned
properties seized by the Cuban government in the wake of the 1959
revolution. More than a hundred foreign companies, including Canadian
ones, are believed to be using these properties for profit. </I>
<P>
<I>In March, the United States approved the controversial Helms-Burton
law, in an effort to tighten economic sanctions on the Fidel Castro
government. That law has already allowed the U.S. to deny visas
to shareholders and top executives of foreign companies that do
business in Cuba, like Canada's Sherritt International Corporation.
</I>
<P>
<I>Another provision of the Helms-Burton law, approved by president
Clinton today, gives Americans the right to sue foreign companies
that operate on lands forfeited by U.S. citizens during the Cuban
revolution. By passing the lawsuit provision, Clinton appeases
Cuban-American voters as he heads towards November's presidential
election. </I>
<P>
<I>By imposing a six-month delay on the ability to file lawsuits,
Clinton appeases U.S. trading partners who have threatened to
take their own retaliatory actions against the states.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Netanyahu Woes </H3>

<P>
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to office on a
campaign of hard-line security pledges ....but Netanyahu the candidate..
and Netanyahu the leader, face vastly different challenges.. and
when it comes to relations with Arab leaders, the prime minister
is having to consider the big picture as well as local concerns.

<HR>

<H3>JAMA Drug Testing </H3>

<P>
From Ben Johnson to silken Laumann, Canada has had it's share
of controversy over doping at the Olympics... Dr. Robert Kaufmann
looks at how medical science is trying to stay one step ahead
of the athletes in the race for clean and fair competition.

<H3>Indy Update </H3>

<P>
An inquest may be held into the fatal crash at the Indy car race
in Toronto. Dr. Robert Huxter, says it could take six weeks to
conclude the investigation into yesterday's crash. At that time,
he'll determine whether an inquest is warranted. 
<P>
Thousands were horrified when a car driven by rookie driver Jeff
Krosnoff, sailed into the air and crumbled as it smashed into
the chain link fencing along the back straight-away. The 31-year-old
driver and a volunteer race marshal, 44-year-old Gary Avrin of
Calgary, were both instantly killed. 
<HR>

<H3>Dutch Hercules </H3>

<P>
A Hercules cargo plane belonging to the Belgian military, crashed
today at Eindhoven Air Force base in Holland. Military authorities
confirm 26 people died in the crash. Dozens were hurt. 
<P>
Dutch television reports, say the four-engine turbo-prop carried
four crew members and 50 Dutch military musicians, on a flight
from Italy. Eindhoven is located about 200 kilometres south of
Amsterdam.
<HR>

<H3>U.K. Air Show </H3>

<P>
Yet another disaster at a vintage aircraft exhibition. A second
world war fighter plane crashed and exploded at a British air
show yesterday, killing the pilot. 
<P>
Thousands of spectators watched in horror as the &quot;Lockheed
P-38 Lightning&quot; lost control. Witnesses say the plane flew
low across the runway and either touched the ground or another
plane, cartwheeling across the runway and bursting into flames.

<HR>

<H3>Oshawa Rape </H3>

<P>
A 14-year-old Oshawa girl is expected to survive a vicious weekend
attack, but police say it will be some time before they can talk
to her. The girl is in critical condition after she was beaten,
sexually assaulted and abandoned beside railway tracks. 
<P>
The girl was reported missing about 3 a-m yesterday by her parents,
and found 12 hours later by a boy taking a short cut through the
area. So far no arrests have been made. 
<HR>

<H3>Drug User Fees </H3>

<P>
Seniors groups say the province is forcing them to choose between
drugs, food or paying the rent. That's their reaction to new fees
that started today. 
<P>
Low income seniors and people collecting welfare now have to pay
a two-dollar fee for each prescription. Seniors with higher incomes
will also have to pay a 100-dollar deductible, plus dispensing
fee. 
<P>
Many pharmacies say they'll absorb the new fees. 
<HR>

<H3>Breast Feeding </H3>

<P>
And, surprising statistics from a study published in the Canadian
Medical Association Journal. Half of all 523 hospitals surveyed
indicate an alliance between medical centers and manufacturers
of baby formula. As Alex Reynolds reports, advocates of breast
feeding are alarmed. 
<P>
<I>An instinctive function... breast feeding raises eyebrows,
in public places, as well as the question of natural versus manufactured
nourishment. The Medical Journal Study indicates commercial interests
are being served in maternity wards. </I>
<P>
<I>Of 523 hospitals surveyed, half routinely gave newborns commercial
formula. This tends to lead nursing mothers to believe the hospital
supports the principle of formula feed, thereby interfering with
normal breast feeding practices. </I>
<P>
<I>The natural method is supported by McMaster Medical Centre,
as well as Hamilton Civic Hospitals. We were unable to contact
officials at St. Joseph's hospital.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>N.I. Calm </H3>

<P>
In Northern Ireland, there are appeals for calm...after weeks
of escalating violence... capped by a huge bombing this weekend
at a luxury hotel. 
<HR>

<H3>Royal Divorce </H3>

<P>
The prince and princess of Wales have begun divorce proceedings.
A judge has granted them the first stage of a divorce that will
become final August 28th. 
<P>
Neither Charles nor Diana attended the three-minute hearing, in
a drab London courtroom. 
<HR>

<H3>Sultan B-day </H3>

<P>
Prince Charles was however on hand to celebrate the 50th birthday
of the man considered to be the richest person in the world. 
<P>
The Sultan of Brunei marked his birthday in grand style with a
military style parade followed by a private concert given by Michael
Jackson. The million dollar bash is expected to last 15 days.
<HR>

<H3>Ballroom Win </H3>

<P>
First they were the tops in Canada, now in North America. Beverley
Cayton-Tang seen here in the pink skirt, and Robert Tang have
won the North American amateur standards competition in ballroom
dance. They danced their way to the top this weekend in Philadelphia.

<P>
We profiled the Tangs two weeks ago while they were practicing
for the upcoming competition. In a field that's been dominated
in Canada at least by French couples, Beverley and Robert are
the first Ontario couple in 24 years, to become number one in
North America. 
<HR>

<H3>Internet Taxes </H3>

<P>
Technology is supposed to make life easier. But in some cases
...it complicates things. Take the Internet for example. companies
say selling products in cyberspace is very confusing. As they
spend money trying to figure it all out ...consumers end up paying
the bill.

<H3>Bernardo-Police </H3>

<P>
The judge probing the Paul Bernardo murder investigation has issued
a scathing indictment of what he termed, police &quot;bungling,
and gross incompetence&quot;. 
<P>
In the report, Justice Archie Campbell says that if the investigation
had been done right, Kristin French and Leslie Mahaffy probably
would be alive today. 
<HR>

<H3>French Promo </H3>

<P>
And tonight on Final Edition, reporter Lauran Sabourin will bring
us an exclusive interview with Donna French, she is the mother
of one of Paul Bernardo's victims... Kristen French. 
<HR>

<H3>Tennessee Tourist </H3>

<P>
In other news tonight, police in Tennessee are investigating the
apparent murder of yet another Canadian tourist. The body of a
31-year-old Vancouver man, was found at a construction site just
east of Knoxville. No name has been released, but police say it
appears the man was beaten to death. 
<HR>

<H3>Cabinet </H3>

<P>
Tensions between Canada and the United States continue to rise
over the controversial Helms-Burton bill. Yesterday, Washington
moved to bar top executives at Sherritt International from entering
the U.S. The Canadian company, which runs a nickel mine with the
Cuban government, is being penalized for doing business with Fidel
Castro. And although the Canadian government is discussing possible
retaliatory measures, not everyone believes the American threat
is real.
<HR>

<H3>Sherritt </H3>

<P>
Officials at Toronto based mining company Sherritt International
meanwhile, say the company has no intention of leaving Cuba. Instead,
officials say they plan to continue to take advantage of the new
investment climate in Cuba. 
<HR>

<H3>Bertha </H3>

<P>
A group of Wiarton-area soccer players are among those affected
by an evacuation order for the coast of South Carolina. The state
governor issued the order because of approaching hurricane &quot;Bertha.&quot;

<P>
The Wiarton girls team is in Myrtle Beach for a combination soccer
camp-tournament. &quot;Bertha&quot; is aiming toward Cape Fear,
North Carolina, and could hit land tomorrow. 
<HR>

<H3>Autism-Dolphins </H3>

<P>
A Burlington family has turned to a Niagara Falls waterpark to
help their autistic son. After learning that dolphins can sometimes
encourage autistic children to communicate, they requested a special
private visit to Marineland. Annette Hamm and cameraman Larry
Fay went along. 
<P>
<I>While most kids are thrilled by a show like this for some it's
just too much to take in. Especially for kids like Justin Learn
of Burlington. The ten year old is autistic. </I>
<P>
<I>When Justin got a pass to Marineland from his ball team, his
mom asked for a private audience with the dolphins. She'd heard
about studies being done in Florida using dolphins to help autistic
kids communicate. While he didn't speak, Justin did respond well
during his dolphin encounter. </I>
<P>
<I>Marineland officials get requests for private audiences with
the dolphins every day. They stress this was a special wish granted
to Justin on his birthday, and they can't handle other requests.</I>

<H3>Visas Denied </H3>

<P>
Washington has decided to bar the top shareholders and officers
of a Canadian firm from entering the United States. The step is
being taken under the &quot;Helms-Burton Act&quot; that punishes
non-American firms which do business with Cuba. 
<P>
Sources in the American capital say the Canadian firm is Sherritt
International, which mines nickel and cobalt in eastern Cuba.
It's head office is based in Toronto. The entry ban is to take
effect in six weeks. 
<HR>

<H3>Florida Boycott </H3>

<P>
Oxfam - Canada meanwhile, is leading a coalition of churches and

The coalition says the legislation is hindering efforts to provide
aid in the Caribbean country. 
<HR>

<H3>Car Pollution </H3>

<P>
Ontario motorists could soon be facing another fee when they go

of mandatory pollution tests for cars and trucks.

Management Board chair Dave Johnson, says nothing has been finalized,
but the testing might start on cars anywhere from two to five
years old. 
<HR>

<H3>Ont. Licence Plates </H3>

<P>
Ontario licence plates will soon look a little bit different.
Another character is being added to the plates, because the province
is running out of licence plate combinations. 
<P>
New seven-character plates will be introduced in December. Personalized
plates will soon be available with up to eight-characters. 
<P>
Transportation ministry officials say the new plate combinations
should last at least 100 years before they'll have to add even
more characters.
<HR>

<H3>Cocaine Boy </H3>

<P>
A four-year-old Toronto boy has been handed over to Children's
Aid officials, after his mother was accused of feeding him crack
cocaine and prescription drugs.

including criminal negligence causing bodily harm. 
<HR>

<H3>Bernardo Report </H3>

<P>
The long awaited Campbell Report will be released tomorrow. That's
the government's report into the handling of the Paul Bernardo
murder investigation. We will have extensive coverage of the details
of that report on our newscasts throughout the day beginning at
noon. 
<HR>

<H3>Self Employed </H3>

<P>
More Canadians than ever, are turning to self-employment as a
way to make a living. Federal figures show that in 1994, 2.2-million
Canadians earned at least some money, by creating their own job.
That's an increase of nearly six per cent over the previous year
-- and the largest increase since 1987. 
<P>
The biggest hike came in Oshawa, where the number of self-employed
people jumped by 10.5 per cent. 
<HR>

<H3>O.A.C. </H3>

<P>
The Ontario Arts Council has released a study showing arts groups
generate more tax revenue for the province, than they get in funding.

groups raised 50-million dollars in Ontario tax revenues -- topping
the 42-million dollars in funding they received from the province.

<P>
The groups were also responsible for almost seven-thousand jobs
in the province. 
<HR>

<H3>Strawberry Aftermath </H3>

<P>
Niagara's strawberry season is winding down. 1996 has been a banner
year for growers in the peninsula.... thanks to the berry scare
south of the border. Lauran Sabourin has the story. 
<P>
<I>As far as many consumers are concerned this year California
berries aren't much better than poison. Fears of parasitic contamination.
Contamination with the parasite cyclospora that made more than
one thousand people sick. </I>
<P>
<I>Fruit Haven farms in Niagara on the Lake has been doing a booming
berry business this year. A pick your own operation that draws
berry eaters from all over. Strawberries, raspberries. People
aren't afraid to eat the home grown product. </I>
<P>
<I>At the local markets around Niagara strawberries are selling
briskly. Selling so quickly shelves are nearly empty. </I>
<P>
<I>Berry season in Niagara is extremely short. A couple of weeks
and you've missed it. For consumers here who wait months for the
opportunity to get out in the fields and pick, it'll take a lot
more than a parasite scare south of the border to turn their noses
up at the home grown harvest.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Kevorkian </H3>

<P>
Dr. Jack Kevorkian has dropped off another body at a Detroit-area

from multiple sclerosis -- had been meeting with Kevorkian for
months. 
<HR>

<H3>Northern Ireland </H3>

<P>
The British government is preparing to send a large force of troops
back into northern Ireland. For three days, police and Protestants
have fought over rights to celebrate an ancient victory on the
battlefield. That 300-year-old battle threatens to claim a new
casualty...the peace process in northern Ireland. 
<HR>

<H3>Belfast Violence </H3>

<P>
Britain is sending another one-thousand troops to northern Ireland

<P>

youths attacked officers with gasoline bombs and rocks, set fire
to vehicles and blocked streets with burning barricades last night
and early today. 
<HR>

<H3>Bertha </H3>

<P>
The evacuations are under way in the American southeast ahead
of hurricane &quot;Bertha.&quot; Florida has ordered 500-thousand
people out of the way of the storm now churning northwest across

<HR>

<H3>Labor Strikes </H3>

<P>
And traffic was also re-routed in various cities across the province,
during the series of day-long strikes, organized by Ontario's
labour movement. But those strikes may soon grind to a halt following
a ruling today by the Ontario Labor Relations Board, deeming one
of those strikes illegal. 
<HR>

<H3>Native</H3>

<P>
The grand chief of the Assembly of First Nations, is urging a
more militant stance in relations with Canada's governments.

bottles and firecrackers at riot police today. 
<P>
Police fired back with plastic bullets when protesters tried to
cut through barbed wire barriers. 
<HR>

<H3>Sharon Appointment </H3>

<P>
One of Israel's biggest hawks is back in political life. Israeli
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appointed Ariel Sharon to
his cabinet -- as minister of national infrastructure.

heels of yet another controversy, involving Netanyahu's wife,
and a former nanny. 
<HR>

<H3>AIDS Conference</H3>

Vancouver. Projections released today show the number of people
worldwide infected with the aids virus is expected to double in
less than four years. 
<P>

44-million people will fall victim to HIV. But not all news coming
out of the conference is bad.
<HR>

<H3>Wescam - Olympics </H3>

<P>
In eleven days the eyes of the world will be focused on the Olympic
games in Atlanta. And as Lauran Sabourin reports a Hamilton area
company will be providing the perspective through which the world
will watch the event. 
<P>
<I>Fifteen thousand athletes and coaches. Two million spectators.
Three billion television viewers. And those viewers will be watching
with the technology of Wescam. </I>
<P>
<I>Wescam technology will allow the world to see the athletes
close up. The physical exertion. The elation. The disappointment.
</I>
<P>
<I>On a much larger scale the Atlanta games represent the most
ambitious civilian telecommunications venture since the space
program. This level and scale of technology have never been attempted
before. </I>
<P>
<I>This is the largest presence Wescam will have at the Olympic
games. This year the company will be operating at 19 different
venues, and will have the bragging rights within their industry
that they were at the 96 Olympics.</I>

<H3>Health Blinds</H3>

<P>
One of North America's largest blind producers says virtually
every inexpensive plastic mini-blind in Canada likely contains
lead that could pose a health risk to children. 
<P>
A Royal Plastics official estimates 99 per cent of the mini-blinds
are made in China or Taiwan, where rules are lax on lead content.
Health Canada has issued a warning that PVC mini-blinds should
be removed from windows immediately. Lead poisoning can retard
motor skills and cause brain damage in children. 
<HR>

<H3>Sexual Assault</H3>

<P>
Even hardened Toronto police officers have been taken aback by
this investigation. A 15-year-old Toronto boy is to undergo a
psychiatric assessment after being charged with sexually assaulting
his mother. 
<P>
Police say the woman was taken to hospital and treated following
the assault almost two weeks ago. One detective said he had never
heard of a similar case in his 20 years on the job. 
<P>
The youth has been placed in the care of the Children's Aid Society.

<HR>

<H3>Rent Controls </H3>

<P>

audience with Pope John Paul on Thursday. Then, it's on to Lyon,
France for the group of seven meeting. 
<P>
The G-7 is made up of the world's top seven industrial nations
-- Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy and the US.
Last year, the G-7 meeting was held in Halifax. 
<HR>

<H3>Singapore </H3>

<P>
Prosecutors in Singapore are demanding that a Canadian, convicted
of possessing and consuming marijuana, be jailed for up to 40
years. 
<P>
43-year-old Ronald Wilson McCulloch of Toronto, escaped the gallows
this week when prosecutors reduced the charges from trafficking.
Reduced charges are rare in Singapore which has hanged more than
120 convicted drug traffickers, including westerners, in its relentless
drive against narcotics smuggling and drug abuse.
<HR>

<H3>Netanyahu </H3>

<P>
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he's eager to resume
peace talks with the Palestinians and Israel's neighbors. 
<P>
He issued the statement as he and US Secretary of State Warren
Christopher held their first face-to-face meeting in Jerusalem.
Christopher failed to reach a hoped-for agreement with Netanyahu
to pull Israeli troops in the West Bank out of Arab areas of Hebron.

<HR>

<H3>Charles Ireland </H3>

<P>
Police were everywhere as Prince Charles began his first visit

Police marksmen stood rooftop guard at Belfast docks, while officers
in rubber dinghies patrolled the waters. 
<P>
Charles arrived today on the royal yacht Britannia -- which is
shadowed by a warship -- for a three-day visit. Charles has been
the target of anti-British protests during previous visits.

<H3>Peterborough Protest </H3>

<P>
Several thousand people rallied in Peterborough, Ontario today
in the labor movement's fourth major protest against the provincial
government. 
<P>
Speakers accused the Tory government of destroying the fabric
of society while benefiting the rich. Many government services
and some businesses were also shut down by pickets. 
<P>
Union members are protesting cuts to jobs and social services,
as well as new labor legislation. 
<HR>

<H3>Hampton-House </H3>

<P>
Newly elected NDP leader Howard Hampton took his seat in the legislature
today, amid accolades from all sides of the house. But that didn't
deter the NDP leader from launching a wholesale attack on the
government.
<HR>

<H3>Quebec Riot </H3>

<P>
Police admit they were caught off guard when rioters started pelting
the National Assembly with bottles and rocks during a riot in
Quebec City. 
<P>
Windows were smashed and businesses in the city's old quarter
were looted in violence that began after a rock concert that was
part of Quebec's Fete Nationale celebrations. The early morning
riot spread to the National Assembly where damage is estimated
at 200-thousand dollars. 
<P>
Premier Lucien Bouchard says he's &quot;very dismayed&quot; by
the damage done to the legislature. But he rejects any suggestion
that there was a message for politicians in the attack. 
<HR>

<H3>Dallaire Court </H3>

<P>
Police say the man accused of breaking into 24 Sussex Drive last
fall told them he would have tried to kill the prime minister
had he come face to face with him. Andr&eacute; Dallaire's statement
was included in the charges read in an Ottawa courtroom today.

<P>
The 34-year-old Dallaire pleaded not guilty to attempted murder,
break and enter, being unlawfully in a dwelling and possession
of a weapon. 
<HR>

<H3>Arab Summit </H3>

<P>
Arab nations and Israel are still adjusting to new Mideast realities,
following the election of the new hard-line Israeli government.

<P>
The 21-nation Arab Summit concluded in Cairo yesterday. Delegates
left generally supporting the land-for-peace principal that has
helped advance the Mideast peace process. The big question is:
will new prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu continue offering Israeli
land?
<HR>

<H3>Hurricane Alma </H3>

<P>
The season's first pacific hurricane pounded Mexico's southern
coast with four-metre waves today. Hurricane &quot;alma&quot;
has killed at least three people, collapsed shanties and downed
trees and power lines. 
<P>
Hundreds of people were evacuated to emergency shelters as &quot;alma&quot;
lashed the pacific coast. News of the damage has trickled in slowly.
Telephone contact is cut with parts of the area and road travel
is extremely difficult. 
<HR>

<H3>Shuttle Activity </H3>

<P>
The crew of Space Shuttle Columbia, which includes Canadian astronaut
Dr. Bob Thirsk, got a wake up call today from David Bowie's &quot;space
oddity.&quot; 
<P>
More workouts are on tap today, as Columbia astronauts study the
effects of weightlessness. One crew member says the exercises
are actually more comfortable in space. But NASA expects the sessions
to become more difficult, as the crew gets weaker from prolonged
weightlessness. 
<HR>

<H3>Paula Jones </H3>

<P>
Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against U.S. president Clinton
is on hold until after November's presidential election. 
<P>
The American Supreme Court today agreed to decide whether Jones'
lawsuit should be delayed while Clinton remains in office. The
court likely will hear arguments this fall -- with a decision
not likely until 1997. 
<HR>

<H3>Hillary Book</H3>

<P>
President Clinton's wife, meanwhile, is also in the news tonight....
a new book by Watergate reporter Bob Woodward, tells of conversations
the first lady allegedly had with long departed personalities.

<H3>1st Min. </H3>

<P>
Canada's first ministers are tip toeing through a constitutional
minefield in Ottawa today. 
<P>
The morning session was devoted to renewal of the Canadian federation
and, specifically, the requirement that the amending formula be
discussed by 1997. It's a session in which Quebec premier Lucien
Bouchard won't be participating. 
<HR>

<H3>NDP-Evng. </H3>

<P>
Ontario's New Democrats have vowed to never again introduce legislation
that would destroy collective agreements. Meeting in Hamilton,
NDP delegates are fully cognizant of the fact that the social
contract led to their downfall. 
<P>
<I>The convention lacks spark. The nearly 2000 delegates from
across Ontario are painfully aware of the fact that the last time
they met here in Hamilton they were in government. And so a major
part of this weekend event is to rebuild the party...to put it
in a position where it can again form the government. To that
end, a lot of Tory bashing can be heard. </I>
<P>
<I>Organized labour is still trying to come to terms with the
previous NDP government's social contract legislation. Collective
agreements were summarily ripped up and unions felt betrayed.
That issue came to a head this afternoon.. </I>
<P>
<I>But delegates eventually overwhelmingly approved a resolution
promising never to again introduce legislation that would destroy
collective agreements. </I>
<P>
<I>Federal NDP leader Alexa Mcdonough says the winds of change
are blowing in the new democrats' direction. She told a subdued
audience that election victories in British Columbia and Nova
Scotia are just the beginning. </I>
<P>
<I>When the convention wraps up tomorrow, there will be a new
party leader. Former cabinet ministers Francis Lankin, Tony Silipo,
Howard Hampton and Peter Kormos are seeking the top post.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Teen Swarming </H3>

<P>
A 14-year-old boy who was swarmed at a Toronto subway station
last night, is improving in hospital. The boy was attacked by
at least five youths at the Kennedy subway station. 
<P>
He was grabbed on the platform and forced onto the last car of
a subway train, where he was beaten with broken bottles and steel
pipes. 
<P>
He escaped about 20 minutes later. His condition has been upgraded
from poor to good. 
<HR>

<H3>Weeping Workers </H3>

<P>
The Harris government has privatized the subsidized dining operations
at Queens Park. The staff are complaining they are being offered
less hours and drastically reduced wages by the new company taking
over. 
<HR>

<H3>Bourassa Cancer </H3>

<P>
Robert Bourassa has been diagnosed with melanoma. It's the third
time the skin cancer has struck the former Quebec premier. 
<P>
Bourassa checked into hospital a week ago and was first said to
have an inner ear infection. But an official with Notre-dame Hospital
says tests found it was melanoma. 
<HR>

<H3>Cancer Rate </H3>

<P>
The cancer rate for men in Ontario is nearly one-quarter higher
than it is for women. A new study says more than 200-thousand
males have been stricken by the disease in the last decade. 
<P>
The Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation says lung,
prostate and colo-rectal cancer cases, are partly to blame for
the 23 percent difference in the sexes. 
<P>
The cancer rate for Ontario men between 1980 and 1991 was 311
out of every 100-thousand. that compares to 254 of every 100-thousand
women. 
<HR>

<H3>Kevorkian 31st. </H3>

<P>
A 67-year old Ohio woman with a painful neurological disease died
last night with the help of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. It's his second
assisted suicide this week and the 31st since 1990. 
<P>
Lawyer Geoffrey Fieger says Bette Lou Hamilton of Ohio, had been
consulting Kevorkian for seven months. The lawyer doesn't say
how Kevorkian helped the death, or how Hamilton committed suicide.

<HR>

<H3>Unabomber Wrap</H3>

<P>
Theodore Kaczynski will be moved to Sacramento, California to
face charges in four Unabomber attacks. A federal judge in Helena,
Montana, has granted the government's request to move Kaczynski.
But authorities won't say when the move will take place. 
<HR>

<H3>Diana </H3>

<P>
Another royal is in the news tonight... this time it's prince
William, the eldest son of prince Charles and princess Diana.

<P>
William, who has become a teenage heart-throb amongst British
school girls, celebrated a birthday today with a visit from his
royal mom.

<HR>

<H3>By-election </H3>

<P>
Sheila Copps is on her way back to Parliament Hill after easily
winning the Hamilton East federal by-election. 
<P>
Copps captured almost twice as many votes as her nearest rival
in yesterday's by-election... in the riding she has held for 12
years. 
<P>
Copps is expected to once again be appointed deputy prime minister
and heritage minister ... portfolios she lost when she quit her
seat seven weeks ago, fulfilling an election promise to resign
if the liberals didn't scrap the GST. 
<HR>

<H3>Ministers GST </H3>

<P>
The GST is stealing the spotlight at the finance ministers meeting
in Fredericton. Federal minister Paul Martin had hoped to focus
on reforming the Canada Pension Plan -- to save it from bankruptcy.
But so far he's been listening to complaints and demands over
the GST. 
<P>
Alberta, for example, is dead set against forcing taxpayers to
compensate provinces to merge their taxes with the federal levy.

<HR>

<H3>Wilson-Malpractice </H3>

<P>
Good news for expectant mothers in the province. Ontario health
minister Jim Wilson announced today that the government will restore
its contribution towards malpractice insurance for obstetricians,
in an effort to persuade doctors to continue delivering babies.
<HR>

<H3>Tsubouchi-Welfare </H3>

<P>
The Ontario government has announced it is setting up computerized
career centres, to help get people on welfare back to work. 
<P>
Social services minister David Tsubouchi says the new &quot;Ontario
Works&quot; centres, will provide the tools for the unemployed,
to find work. 
<P>
The Harris government meanwhile, could face more problems with
its tough new welfare rules. A provincial review board says denying
welfare to 16-and- 17-year-olds, is discriminatory and violates
the charter of rights. The review board ruled in favor of a 16-year
old Belleville girl. 
<HR>

<H3>Ombudsman Report </H3>

<P>
In her annual report, Ontario's ombudsman is warning the government
about its plan to privatize some services. Roberta Jamieson has
told the government to make sure people can still complain about
services sold to the private sector. 
<P>
Her office received 29-thousand complaints about government ministries
and agencies last year -- half from people with incomes less than
30-thousand dollars a year. 
<P>
Jamieson worries the government's move to trim costs could make
life worse for those who need public services the most. 
<HR>

<H3>Mahaffy - justice </H3>

<P>
Debbie Mahaffy is appeared before a commons justice committee
today that's holding hearings on proposed amendments to the so-called
<I>faint hope clause</I>. That's a provision that allows killers
serving life to apply for a parole hearing after serving 15 years
in prison. 
<P>
Mahaffy, whose 14-year-old daughter Leslie, was murdered five
years ago by Paul Bernardo, says the amendments proposed by the
justice minister don't go far enough. She adds that victims and
their families were not given sufficient time to prepare for the
hearing. 
<HR>

<H3>Saskatchewan Boy </H3>

<P>
In Saskatoon, a hushed court heard some gruesome details in the
case of a seven year-old Saskatchewan boy killed last year. 
<P>
The prosecution told the court a 14-year-old boy killed and skinned
his young playmate -- then cooked his flesh on a stove at home.

<P>
Sandy Charles is accused of luring seven-year-old Johnathan Thimpsen
into a bush last July. Thimpsen was stabbed several times, then
beaten with a rock and a bottle. Charles has pleaded not guilty
to first-degree murder and is being tried in adult court, so his
name can be used. 
<HR>

<H3>Palma Court </H3>

<P>
The man charged in the Victoria Day slayings of three Toronto
prostitutes, appeared in court today and was remanded in custody
until July 10th. 
<P>
30 year-old Marcello Palma of north York, could spend the summer
awaiting a chance at bail however. His lawyer, says the crown
will not disclose its evidence in the case for at least two months.
Palma cannot apply for bail until the crown makes that disclosure.

<P>
He is charged with first-degree murder in the shooting deaths
of transvestite Shawn Keegan, transsexual Thomas Wilkinson and
Brenda Ludgate. 
<HR>

<H3>Unabomber </H3>

<P>
Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski now faces a ten-count indictment.
He was charged today, for the first time, in the Unabomber crimes.

<P>
The indictment from a grand jury in Sacramento, California accuses
Kaczynski of four of the 16 bombings. Two of them were fatal attacks
in Sacramento. Two others involved mail bombs allegedly mailed
in Sacramento. 
<P>
Kaczynski was arrested in April at his Montana shack. 
<HR>

<H3>Russia Politics </H3>

<P>
A shakeup in Russia's government could pave the way to re-election
for president Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin has appointed retired general
Alexander Lebed as his new national security advisor. Lebed finished
third in the first round of presidential elections.

<H3>Hamilton East By-election</H3>

<P>
In just a few hours the polls will close and we'll know if Sheila
Copps will return to Ottawa. The veteran MP quit last month, fulfilling
a promise made in the 1993 election that if the GST didn't go,
she would. 
<P>
Dwight Ryan joins us now from the Copps headquarters in Hamilton
east. 
<P>
<I>Out for a stroll on election day, Sheila Copps appears relaxed.
After all, the Liberals have reigned in Hamilton east for more
than 30 years and the Copps name in Hamilton is synonymous with
community service. </I>
<P>
<I>New Democrat Wayne Marston has said from the beginning that
its a two way race between him and Sheila Copps. He'll find out
tonight just how close a race it is. Marston and Copps are the
only two candidates of thirteen in the race who live in the riding.
</I>
<P>
<I>A recent spectator poll showed Tory Angie Tomasic in third
place. The feisty bank manager was out with supporters this morning
searching for support. Tomasic isn't worried about the Reform
party competing for the right wing vote. Its also something that
doesn't bother Reform candidate Andy Sweck. </I>
<P>
<I>Voter turnout was heavy at this polling station. And voters
we spoke to led us to believe that it will be far from a Liberal
landslide.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Housing Coops </H3>

<P>
In other news tonight, more than 30 Ontario housing co-ops took
the Harris government to court today in an effort to make the
housing ministry live up to contracts for the building of almost
17-thousand non-profit housing units.
<HR>

<H3>Russian Elects </H3>

<P>
Turning to world news, with a run-off ballot in the works for
the Russian presidency, Boris Yeltsin and his chief rival are
both courting a tough, former general. 
<P>
Yeltsin has already met with Alexander Lebed, who ran third in
yesterday's election. Communist challenger Gi-nawdy Zoo-gah-nawf
plans to offer Lebed a top job in the government. He has also
hinted the ex-general would suffer if he doesn't accept. 
<HR>

<H3>Trucker Charged </H3>

<P>
A trucker from Florenceville, New Brunswick, who is charged in
a deadly crash in Massachusetts remains behind bars. Bail for
Austin Kilcollins was set at 200-thousnd dollars, but he hasn't
come up with the money. 
<P>
Three young children and two of their grandparents were killed
Saturday, when a truck smashed into the rear of their minivan
as it sat in a freeway breakdown lane. 
<P>
Kilcollins entered no plea at his arraignment today on charges
that include vehicular homicide. 
<HR>

<H3>Church Fire </H3>

<P>
The rash of church fires in the American south appears to becoming
an epidemic. Fire gutted the hills of a Baptist church near Rocky
Point North Carolina overnight. The pastor of the black church
says he's not sure whether it was arson. 
<P>
And in suburban Atlanta, authorities are calling an early morning
fire at a church suspicious. It heavily damaged the former sanctuary
of a Baptist church, where most of the congregation is white.

<P>
There have been fires at 35 black churches, and 23 white churches
over the past 18 months. 
<HR>

<H3>Lebanon Explosion </H3>

<P>
At least six Palestinians were feared dead and 16 wounded by a
huge explosion at Lebanon's largest Palestinian refugee camp today.

<P>
The blast ripped through the home of an explosives expert in Yasser
Arafat's Fatah Faction, in a camp in southern Lebanon. The cause
of the blast is not immediately known. 
<HR>

<H3>IRA Bomb </H3>

<P>
In Manchester England, engineers spent today assessing the damage
caused by Saturday's bomb blast. More than 200 people were injured,
but no-one killed, when a bomb exploded in the heart of the northern
English city, which was packed with tourists attending the European
soccer championships. 
<P>
Multi-party talks at Stormont Castle near Belfast today were overshadowed
by the bomb attack. But politicians on all sides are determined
to continue the peace process. 
<HR>

<H3>New Zealand Volcano </H3>

<P>
New Zealand's Mount Roo-a-pay-you volcano is staging a spectacular
eruption. It's sending huge clouds of steam and ash high into
the sky. 
<P>
The renewal of volcanic activity came only days after officials
had downgraded the alert status of the mountain. There were no
reports of injuries but the area was being evacuated as a precaution.

<H3>Driving Crackdown</H3>

<P>
Beginning Monday police forces across the province will be cracking
down on aggressive drivers. Reckless and speeding drivers account
for the lion's share of accidents on the roads. And as Lauran
Sabourin reports the statistics are staggering. 
<P>
<I>Every day on average there are over 600 vehicle collisions
in Ontario. That's one every two minutes. Someone is injured in
an accident every six minutes. And every nine hours someone is
killed on Ontario roadways. </I>
<P>
<I>Constable Terry Marino is an OPP officer based in Burlington.
Every day he's traveling the highways. And every day he sees drivers
only inches away from a accident. </I>
<P>
<I>Unsafe lane changes. Following too close. Excessive speeding
are what the police are going to keeping a close eye on over the
next two weeks. Speeders with illegal radar detectors who try
to hide the evidence once they're pulled over. It's cat and mouse
game the police usually win. The penalty for having a radar detector
is 165 dollars. The penalty for speeding can run much higher.
</I>
<HR>

<H3>Truck Safety </H3>

<P>
Starting this summer, a new American regulation will require all
Canadian transport drivers to be tested for drugs before they
can enter the United States. And, most Ontario truckers have no
quarrel with the new law. 
<HR>

<H3>Cop Shot </H3>

<P>
A Mountie and a civilian were killed today in a shooting near
Lunenberg, Nova Scotia. The RCMP say officers responded to a domestic
dispute and that a male officer -- a 29-year veteran of the force
-- was shot when he approached a suspect. The suspect was then
shot by backup officers. No names have been released. 
<HR>

<H3>Toronto Shooting </H3>

<P>
Toronto police are searching for four suspects after a man was
killed after a robbery attempt at a roadhouse restaurant this
morning. 
<P>
Police say the armed suspects entered the restaurant just after
three this morning. They say they ordered the 10 or so workers
and their friends to the floor and fired several shots. When the
suspects fled on foot, a doorman gave chase and was later shot
after a fight. Dead is 23-year- old Raymond Saikkonen of Toronto.

<HR>

<H3>Toronto stabbing </H3>

<P>
more violent youth crime... this time in Toronto where a 17-year-old
youth remains in stable condition in hospital after being stabbed
in the lobby of a Toronto movie theatre. police say the boy was
stabbed twice in the chest and once in the side of the head last
night. they say he was attacked after a verbal dispute with four
other teens. 
<HR>

<H3>Freemen Follow</H3>

<P>
Fourteen members of the Montana Freemen face charges that include
circulating bogus cheques and threatening to kill a federal judge.
They surrendered yesterday. 
<P>
The FBI says nobody got any plea bargains in the surrender agreement...
and lessons learned in previous stand-offs led to the peaceful
resolution. 
<HR>

<H3>Jail Abuse </H3>

<P>
The province's child advocate says it was a mistake to take inmates
who rioted at a youth centre in Goderich to an adult jail. 
<P>
Judy Finlay says they were treated like dangerous adult offenders
at the London's Elgin-Middlesex Detention Centre ... and that
may have led to allegations of inmates being beaten and strip
searched when they arrived from Goderich. 
<P>
She says young offenders can't be treated like adults. 
<HR>

<H3>Forest Fires </H3>

<P>
Open campfires, and brush and grass burning, have been banned
across northwestern Ontario. The province has imposed the ban
because of the rising number of forest fires in the region. 
<P>
There are more than 250 fires burning in the province, most in
northwest Ontario. Fires have forced the evacuation of more than
100 people from Fort Hope, 220 kilometres north of Geraldton,
because of smoke.

as the gambling capitol of North America. 
<P>
The Harris government today, paved the way for the introduction
of video gambling into the province. 
<HR>

<H3>OPSEU Inquiry </H3>

<P>
The man responsible for security at Queen's Park says he was unaware
the riot squad was used against striking civil servants until
he watched the evening news. 
<P>
Speaker Al McLean told an inquiry that the security plan called
for the OPP riot squad to be on standby and use force if necessary.
McLean says he was aware of some disruption on the OPSEU picket
line, but he didn't know the riot squad had been called in until
he saw it on television. 
<P>
McLean also says while he's responsible for security, he relies
on his staff to do the job. 
<HR>

<H3>Baby Shot </H3>

<P>
The baby who was shot in the head with a pellet gun before his
birth has regained consciousness. Fourteen-day old Jonathan Drummond
has been moved off the critical list at the Children's Hospital
of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa. Whether he'll ever fully recover
isn't known. 
<P>
His mother -- 28-year old Brenda Drummond -- is charged with attempted
murder. She's undergoing a psychiatric assessment. 
<HR>

<H3>Children Fire </H3>

<P>
There may be an inquest into a house fire that killed four Kitchener
children and injured their mother this week. That word comes from
Dr. Karen Acheson, the regional coroner. 
<P>
Investigators are sifting through the charred remains of the house,
trying to determine what caused the blaze. Reports the children
had been playing with a lighter before the fire started Tuesday
morning have not been confirmed. But fire officials say that is
the suspected cause of the fire. 
<HR>

<H3>Forest Fires </H3>

<P>
Fire officials in northern Ontario are asking that crews from
outside the province be brought in to help fight forest fires.
The forest fire count in the north has reached a hundred and seventy
three -- with more than 100 new fires burning today. Officials
are also seeking a ban on open fires. The fires are not threatening
any communities. 
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 40 new forest fires have started in the past
24 hours in northern New Brunswick. Frequent lightning strikes
are causing trouble. Four-hundred firefighters are battling the
blazes and waterbomber aircraft are being brought in from Nova
Scotia and Maine. A total of 60 fires are burning. But no communities
are threatened. 
<HR>

<H3>Salaried Doctors </H3>

<P>
The Harris government will pay doctors up to a hundred and ninety
four thousand dollars a year to go into under-serviced areas of
the province. Under a new plan released today the province will
also foot overhead costs and pay for vacation time, as well as
continue education of doctors who agree to go to 21 areas, mainly
in northern Ontario. 
<P>
Health minister Jim Wilson says if the plan is successful, doctors
in larger communities may be taken off fees for service and become
salaried. 
<HR>

<H3>Same Sex </H3>

<P>
Gay rights organizations are hailing a Canadian Human Rights Commission
decision on spousal benefits. The Commission says that the federal
government and companies such as banks, that are federally- regulated,
must provide same-sex couples the same benefits they give other
couples. 
<P>
Complaints filed by two federal employees led to the decision.

<HR>

<H3>Japan Crash </H3>

<P>
Japanese police say there were hundred and seventy two survivors
among the two hundred and seventy five people aboard an aging
Indonesian plane that went down today. The jet was engulfed in
flames after a failed takeoff from a Japanese airport. 
<P>
A police spokesman says 12 passengers -- who had been unaccounted
for and feared still trapped in the plane -- have been found at
local hospitals. The cause of the fire is still not known. 
<HR>

<H3>Copter Crash </H3>

<P>
The death toll in a Wednesday night collision of two blackhawk
helicopters climbed to 18 today as investigators sought to explain
Australia's worst peacetime military accident in decades. 
<P>
Officials confirmed that the helicopters, flying in darkness,
had their headlights turned off. The pilots were flying with night
vision glasses. Ten crew members were taken to hospital, three
were in critical condition. 
<HR>

<H3>Strawberries </H3>

<P>
Health Canada is warning that American-grown strawberries should
be thoroughly washed before eating. The berries have caused several
cases of parasitic infection across North America, including 21
cases in Canada -- all of them in Toronto. 
<P>
Symptoms include diarrhea, fatigue and abdominal pain. 
<HR>

<H3>Strawberry Crop </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, Ontario's strawberry season is almost here. The harvest
is 12 days behind schedule. And as Lauran Sabourin reports this
is the big weekend for the strawberry festivals in the peninsula
and organizers are getting nervous. 
<P>
<I>Strawberry growers haven't seen anything like it. For weeks
when they look out the window they seen nothing but rain. So much
rain the fields don't dry out. The large green berries take a
long time to ripen. </I>
<P>
<I>John Fedorkow is a strawberry grower in Niagara on the Lake.
He's been wandering around his fields looking at what kind of
crop this late harvest will yield. </I>
<P>
<I>Retailers are getting anxious. Consumers have been asking them
when the Ontario strawberries will be on the shelves. For now
retailers are continuing to put California berries out. But they
aren't moving very well since health officials warned the public
they may be tainted with infectious parasite. And that if you
do eat U.S. berries they should be thoroughly washed. </I>
<P>
<I>Tainted berries late crops have been bad news for the strawberry
festivals. They're hoping that if the weather's nice and they
can get pickers out in the fields they'll have the first crop
of Ontario strawberries this weekend. </I>

<H3>Workfare-Tsubouchi </H3>

<P>
Social services minister David Tsubouchi came to Niagara Falls
today to unveil his government's plan that would see welfare recipients
work for their welfare cheque. 
<P>
Niagara will be one of 20 provincial test sites for the first
phase of the Workfare program. But as Lauran Sabourin reports
this morning anti poverty and labor activists disrupted the conference
and accused the government of acting like nazis. 
<P>
<I>Labor activists see Workfare as exploitation. The government
sees it as implementing a change in philosophy from a hand out
to a hand up. Twenty Ontario communities have been signed up for
the first phase of this project. Regions that include Hamilton
Wentworth, Halton, Peel and Brant County. </I>
<P>
<I>In all it's estimated that 54 thousand welfare recipients will
be put to work. Able bodied welfare recipients. In the first phase
seniors, the disabled and single parents are exempt. </I>
<P>
<I>Critics worry Workfare will take jobs away from those already
employed. Others charge that labor activists are just being fearmongers.
</I>
<P>
<I>Despite all of the fanfare with today's announcement the government
still hasn't' worked out the details. It claims this program it
will put people back to work. Make them more employable. But it's
not quite sure yet how this plan will be executed.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Workfare Reaction </H3>

<P>
Not all Ontarians or municipalities are enamored with the Harris
government's Workfare program announced today. Many say it doesn't
work and isn't fair. 
<HR>

<H3>Palladini-TTC War </H3>

<P>
A war of words has broken out between the Toronto Transit Commission
and the minister of transportation, Al Palladini, over his call
to cut the fat out of the system. 
<P>
Monday Palladini said the TTC was the worst transportation system
in the country. Now he's changed that to the worst operated transit
system in the country. The TTC wants an apology. 
<P>
Another Harris minister Al Leach, who used to head up the TTC
says its record speaks for itself. And its always been the top
transit operation in North America. 
<HR>

<H3>Teller Shot </H3>

<P>
A Canada Trust teller in North York is lucky to be alive after
being grazed by a bullet during a holdup this morning. 
<P>
Police say the 42-year- old woman was shot after three men burst
into the bank. She was treated at hospital for a head wound and
released. 
<P>
Police are searching for the three suspects, who took off in a
car that was later found abandoned with the motor running.
<HR>

<H3>Timmins Water </H3>

<P>
First it was floods, now hot, dry weather has prompted Timmins
to order a cut in water use. The city has issued a ban on watering
lawns. 
<P>
Mayor Vic power says water consumption is increasing and the city
wants to ensure there's enough water for emergency crews. Residents
will be fined if they're caught watering lawns between 10 in the
morning and seven in the evening.

<H3>Fire Deaths </H3>

<P>
We begin tonight with the tragic story of four Kitchener children...
killed early today as the family house burned down. Their mother...
27-year-old Leanne Dumbroskie ... had to be restrained by neighbors
from going back into the house. She was taken to hospital suffering
from first-degree burns to her face, smoke inhalation and shock.

<P>
The kids ... all under 10 years old... may have been playing with
a lighter. 
<HR>

<H3>Kingston Fire </H3>

<P>
A man died in a row house fire in Kingston this morning. Police
have identified the victim as 52-year-old Gerald Percy McGinnis.

<P>
The man had been pulled from the fire by a neighbor and his body
was found in a lane behind the row houses. Firefighters say the
blaze started in a bedroom of one of the units. 
<HR>

<H3>Police Shooting </H3>

<P>
A man was shot dead by police while officers were making an arrest
in east end Toronto this morning. Wayne Rick Williams died in
hospital less than an hour after the shooting. 
<P>
Jim Harding of the special investigations unit says there are
unconfirmed reports the 24-year-old man was brandishing a knife.
Police had been called after complaints a man was breaking car
windows with a crowbar. 
<HR>

<H3>Bluewater Cover-up </H3>

<P>
Ontario's corrections minister says he wants to know if managers
at the Bluewater Centre for Young Offenders near Goderich, spent
the week-end destroying documents. Documents that may substantiate
allegations that inmates were beaten. 
<HR>

<H3>Ipperwash </H3>

<P>
Negotiations on the transfer of camp Ipperwash to the Kettle and
Stoney Point First Nation have been put on hold. The two sides
were to have met today and tomorrow but band spokesman Don Cloud
says it will likely be the first week of July before talks resume.

<P>
Scheduling conflicts, and a need to clarify some issues, are being
cited for the delay. The negotiation committee says it needs more
time to examine all aspects of returning the land, including an
environmental review and clean-up of the site. 
<HR>

<H3>Doctors Leaving </H3>

<P>
If you can't beat 'em ..... quit. That seems to be the answer
for Ontario doctors who are leaving the province in ever-increasing
numbers... because of frustrations with the provincial health
care system. 
<P>
Rising malpractice costs, government clawbacks, increased taxes;
and a sharp decline in respect ... are leading many specialists
out of the province, and even ... out of practice. Scot Urquhart
reports: 
<P>
<I>In the Hamilton office of Dr. Peter Giammichele, hangs a sign
of the times. It's not something he likes to talk about ... no
interviews ... </I>
<P>
<I>But across the street at St. Joseph's hospital; the chief of
orthopedic surgery says the departure of his colleague is no surprise.
Dr. Brett Dunlop says government policies are chasing doctors
out of the system; and a shortage is looming. Dr. Giammichele
is the only practicing surgeon dealing with rheumatoid arthritis,
in the Niagara peninsula. From Niagara Falls, west ... patients
will now have to travel to London for treatment. </I>
<P>
<I>Doctors and specialists in particular; say they are being squeezed
by costs, bashed by taxes, insulted by government, and blamed
for failures in the health care system. </I>
<P>
<I>That may sound like a lot of whining by over-paid professionals,
but according to this man; it's not. Harold Pomerantz is a chartered
accountant with more than a dozen doctors as clients. He sees
the bottom line. And, he says, it isn't good.</I>
<P>
<I>In fact, Pomerantz believes that while doctors have become
easy targets for public frustration with health care ... the truth
is, that many of them aren't paid well enough. And so Brett Dunlop
predicts we will see the backs of many doctors, both young and
old ... as mounting frustration drives them out of the system,
for good. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Public Donations </H3>

<P>
Queen's Park is making it more attractive for people to donate
money to hospitals, libraries and cultural organizations. 
<P>
A bill introduced in the legislature today would help those kinds
of groups establish crown foundations. Donations would then be
treated like money given to universities. 
<P>
Currently, anyone donating to local organizations can claim a
tax credit of up to 50 per cent of their annual income. The new
law would raise that to 100 per cent. 
<HR>

<H3>Oshawa Casino </H3>

<P>
Casino backers in Oshawa have rolled snake-eyes in a city referendum.
Oshawa residents voted 65 per cent against the casino proposal
yesterday. 
<P>
Mayor Nancy Diamond is disappointed, as she saw the casino as
a job creator. The &quot;no&quot; vote against linking up with
any greater Toronto area government was even more resounding --
94 per cent rejected that proposal.

<H3>Harnick-Victims</H3>

<P>
Attorney General Charles Harnick announced today, the government
will spend 10.2-million dollars to give more help to victims of
violent crime. It includes a voice mail system which gives instant
up dates on the progress of victims cases.
<HR>

<H3>Patient Threats </H3>

<P>
Doctor-patient confidentiality rules could soon change to protect
the public from people who threaten to seriously harm or kill.

<P>
The Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons is considering
a recommendation to change the system so doctors told of such
plans would be compelled to notify police and the intended victim.
Right now, doctors who violate patient confidentiality can face
disciplinary action. There are exceptions, such as child abuse
cases. 
<HR>

<H3>Another Slaying </H3>

friend was also shot and is in serious condition in hospital.

<P>
No suspects have been arrested in the shooting that occurred during
an argument early yesterday. 
<HR>

<H3>Stabbing Death </H3>

<P>
A suspect in the fatal stabbing of a teenager at a Toronto subway
station has had his case put over to next week. 
<P>
Seventeen-year- old Michael Amann-Ewaschuk was stabbed in the
chest during a confrontation with several young people last Friday.
Twenty- one-year-old Chad Little of Toronto is charged with second-degree
murder. He appeared in court today and had his case put over until

Two bands of women, one from the east coast the other from the
west have been traveling across the country shouting about the
injustice of poverty. And as Lauran Sabourin reports these women
are delivering their message while rocking and rolling towards
the nation's capital. 
<P>
<I>They arrived in Welland this morning looking a little haggard.
Seven women from eastern Canada who've spent weeks on the road
telling people who will listen how women are paying the price
for policies that discriminate against them. </I>
<P>
<I>1996 has been designated by the United Nations as the year
of eradicating poverty. The participants at this rally are only
speaking about poverty. So many people are living it. Monthly
welfare checks may cover the rent, but little else, while the
poor try to stretch what few dollars the have. </I>
<P>
<I>The anti poverty caravan is continuing to roll across the country.</I>

<H3>Clark Hamilton </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, the battle for ballots in Hamilton East is going down
to the wire, and the candidates are playing out their trump cards.

<P>
This morning, the Conservatives' Angie Tomasic brought in former
Tory prime minister Joe Clark to speak on her behalf. Clark returned
to the issue of accountability, and maintained that sending Sheila
Copps back to Ottawa would give the grits the wrong message. 
<HR>

<H3>Strike-Replacements </H3>

<P>
A Toronto hotel is using replacement workers -- the first time
such workers have been brought across picket lines in Ontario
since a law banning them was scrapped by the Harris government.

<P>
The workers are doing the jobs of about 600 unionized employees
of the Westin Harbor Castle Hotel who went on strike over a wage
dispute this morning. A hotel manager notes replacement workers
were routinely used before the NDP legislation.

<H3>Train Derails </H3>

<P>
If you're a commuter, living west of Toronto ... you were probably
late for work this morning. The Friday morning rush was filled
with much hurry, but little speed; thanks to a train derailment,
in Mississauga. Scot Urquhart reports: 
<P>
<I>It wasn't a typical weekday rush hour. No trains on the tracks.
No commuters on the platform ... no cars in the parking lot. They
were all ... out here. </I>
<P>
<I>No trains to Toronto. A rough start for eastbound commuters
like Derek McDonald ... actively seeking work, resume in hand.
And this, was the source of Derek's frustration. Four cars of
a CN rail freight rain ... derailed near an overpass, at Mississauga
road and Lakeshore ... at five in the morning. </I>
<P>
<I>The wreck barely bothered area residents there is no estimate
on the cost of this wreck ... certainly, it will be expensive.
This fully loaded car carrier can attest to that. But Ian Thomson
says, number crunching is not a priority now; safety, and restored
service, are: no help for these commuters ... but with luck things
should be much easier, when the Monday morning rush, rolls around.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Woman Crushed </H3>

<P>
A 16-year-old Burlington girl is dead, and charges have been laid
against a Prince Edward Island man, following a strange incident
in Mississauga. 
<P>
Sarah Harding died when she slipped under the wheels of a tractor
trailer as she was trying to leave the cab yesterday. Witnesses
say the girl was clinging to the side before she was crushed to
death. The driver was stopped by police half an hour later. 
<P>
31-year-old Kevin Adams is charged with criminal negligence causing
death and failure to remain at the scene of an accident. 
<HR>

<H3>Truck Blitz Results </H3>

<P>
The continent wide annual truck safety blitz ended last night
at midnight... and the results are in from the first two days
of the massive three day effort. 
<P>
Forty per cent of all the trucks pulled over in Ontario were deemed
to be unsafe and were pulled off the road. Just over eight hundred
trucks were taken out of service by the Ministry of Transportation
on Tuesday and Wednesday. That's out of two thousand vehicles
that were checked over. A total of 343 charges were laid. 
<P>
The most common defects involved brakes, tires and suspensions.
The blitz is held every year in Canada, the US. and Mexico. 
<P>
Transportation minister Al Palladini announced recently that fines
for truck safety violations will be increased, with the maximum
fine for serious repeat offenders rising to $5,000 from $2,000.

<P>
The Ontario Trucking Association is taking exception with the
way the ministry is portraying truck safety. The association says
if forty per cent of all the trucks on the road were unsafe, there
would be a lot more accidents involving trucks on the road. 
<HR>

<H3>Greyhound </H3>

<P>
The federal government has reversed the national transportation
agency and given Greyhound Airlines its wings. Transport minister
David Anderson says the company offers a unique mix of air and
bus service and it's in the public interest to allow it to operate.

<P>
The NTA had turned Greyhound down twice, but Anderson says Greyhound
has been able to satisfy ownership requirements, and will launch
its airline with the help of a British Columbia charter carrier.

<HR>

<H3>GM CAW </H3>

<P>
The Canadian Auto Workers suggests it will choose General Motors
as its strike target this fall. Many of the CAW's 700 delegates
wrapping up a meeting in Toronto say the union's current shoving
match with GM will probably erupt into a strike. The major issues
are money and the contacting out of work. 
<HR>

<H3>Ont. Hydro Report </H3>

<P>
A government study released today, recommends that Ontario Hydro
sell off a third of its generating capacity to the private sector.
The report says such a move will lead to lower prices for electrical
power and more choice for power users. 
<HR>

<H3>Mother Evng </H3>

<P>
A Carleton Place woman accused of shooting her unborn baby, was
formally arraigned today on charges of attempted murder and use
of a firearm. 
<P>
The formal charge alleges 28-year-old Brenda Drummond tried to
kill her unborn son with a gun. Defence lawyer Lawrence Greenspon
questions the charge, saying there's nothing in the criminal code
dealing with a baby injured in the womb that survives and is born.
Crown attorney John Waugh says he's confident the charges will
stick. 
<P>
Drummond was released on bail and will undergo a 30-day psychiatric
examination. 
<HR>

<H3>Spies - Court </H3>

<P>
Two Russian spies known as Laurie and Ian Lambert appeared before
an immigration and refugee board adjudicator this afternoon for
a brief deportation hearing. 
<P>
The married couple was arrested May 22nd after they applied for
passports using the names of 2 dead babies. Former intelligence
officers say the Lamberts are not unusual...that Canada is still
awash with Russian secret agents. It's said those agents spend
years mastering Canada's language and popular culture before coming
here and assuming false identities, personalities and life histories.

<P>
The Lamberts surprised a federal court Wednesday by dropping their
claim to be Canadians .. wanting instead to go home rather than
face years behind bars. But they're lawyer says their admitting
nothing about why they've been in Canada for the last 6 years.

<HR>

<H3>Inventor Dead </H3>

<P>
A St. Catharines man who invented the process still widely used
to make instant mashed potatoes, has died. Edward Asselbergs was
69. He died of a massive stroke Tuesday. 
<P>
Asselbergs was a food research scientist with Agriculture Canada
when he developed the technique of drying potato flakes that were
transformed into mashed potatoes when water was added. He patented
the process in 1961 -- but he didn't make a lot of money from
it because 95 per cent of the proceeds went to the federal government.

<H3>Kid Beatings </H3>

<P>
Ontario's minister of corrections says a full investigation is
under way into allegations that teenage prisoners were beaten
by guards, following a riot at the Bluewater Youth Centre near
Goderich. 
<HR>

<H3>Ottawa Mom Charged</H3>

<P>
The mother of a newborn boy, who had a lead pellet removed from
his brain, has been charged with attempted murder. 
<P>
Reports tonight state Brenda Drummond, who is in her late 20's,
was taken into police custody this afternoon. Police have said
they were investigating whether the eight-day-old boy was shot
in the head with a pellet while still inside his mother's womb.
The little boy was in critical but stable condition in an Ottawa
hospital. 
<HR>

<H3>Groin-Kitchener </H3>

<P>
A Kitchener woman is in police custody tonight, in a case that
resembles the highly publicized Lorena Bobbitt case. 
<P>
Kitchener Waterloo Regional Police, say they responded to a 9-1-1
call and found a 50 year old man bleeding from his genitals. The
man's 42 year old common-law wife has been charged with aggravated
assault. 
<P>
The man was scheduled for surgery this afternoon. 
<HR>

<H3>Booze Taxes </H3>

<P>
The Ontario Restaurant Association and representatives from Canadian
distilleries, called on the Harris government today to lower provincial
taxes on booze. The delegation delivered a beer-barrel with over
17-thousand coasters signed by restaurant and bar patrons in the
Windsor area, asking the province to reduce the 85 per-cent tax
on liquor. 
<P>
In accepting the petition, Isabel Bassett, parliamentary assistant
to finance minister Ernie Eves, pointed out that Ontario can't
act alone, since liquor taxing is a joint federal- provincial
matter. The delegation indicated that the high taxes have been
partly responsible for some 19 distilleries closing over the past
18-years. 
<HR>

<H3>Martin - Labor </H3>

<P>
Paul Martin says he and his cabinet colleagues went through the
&quot;tortures of the damned&quot; to find a satisfactory alternative
to the GST. 
<P>
The finance minister told the Canadian Federation of Labor meeting
in Ottawa that 20 options were examined while the government still
felt it was possible to bring in a replacement tax. But he said
Canadians just didn't want to have to adjust to a different kind
of tax. 
<HR>

<H3>Israel Palestinians </H3>

<P>
In world news tonight, incoming Israeli prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is asking Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to tone down
the rhetoric over Palestinian independence. 
<HR>

<H3>Diana Chicago </H3>

<P>
It's Princess Diana's last day in Chicago. 
<P>
This morning, the princess visited a hospice at Northwest Memorial
Hospital, where she met with a patient. Next it was on to an awards
luncheon... her royal highness is scheduled to board a flight
back to England, later this afternoon. 
<HR>

<H3>Fergie Book</H3>

<P>
Another estranged royal is visiting the big apple, apparently
in search of a career change. The newly-divorced Sarah Ferguson,
&quot;ex&quot; to prince Andrew, and the ex-duchess of York, is
getting set to tell all in what's being billed as an &quot;adult
book&quot;.

<H3>Obstetricians Fight </H3>

<P>
A survey of Ontario doctors has found almost 500 of them intend
to stop delivering babies this year. The College of Physicians
and Surgeons questionnaire was sent to 23-hundred doctors who
billed OHIP last year for delivering a baby. 
<P>
The college says 30 per cent of those who replied said they either
have stopped delivering babies or intend to do so. The reason...
rising malpractice insurance costs combined with the province's
10-per-cent clawback of all fees claimed by doctors. 
<P>
Faced with the revolt, health minister Jim Wilson has promised
pregnant women he will find doctors to deliver their babies. 
<HR>

<H3>Welfare Numbers </H3>

<P>
Is the revolution over? The common sense revolution of Mike Harris
seems to have hit the wall, on the social welfare front. 
<P>
After months of decline ... social welfare claims are on the rise
again. Why? Well, as Scot Urquhart reports... no one seems to
know, for sure.
<P>
<I>After nine months of decline ... welfare in Ontario... is on
its way back up. Social Services minister David Tsubouchi calls
that an adjustment in the system .... but an adjustment to what?
Does it mean the welfare system has bottomed out? </I>
<P>
<I>But in the next breath ... Tsubouchi is suggesting that when
Workfare comes in later this month, the numbers will go down again.</I>
<P>
<I>This man doesn't necessarily agree. He is Don Jaffary of the
Social Planning and Research Council of Hamilton Wentworth. His
organization is just wrapping up a study on why welfare numbers
declined in Ontario ... under the Harris government.</I>
<P>
<I>In other words the Tories may have been lucky. Welfare reforms
may have come at exactly the same time as the employment market
improved. </I>
<P>
<I>Underneath the numbers national experts believe there is still
a core of the population that is depressed and hurting because
of government budget cuts.</I>
<P>
<I>Ross says the upside to this experiment, is the degree of serious
discussion concerning the responsibilities of individuals, and
governments to society as a whole. The down side, in his view,
is the irresponsible way, which governments have shirked those
responsibilities.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Sears </H3>

<P>
A Sears employee killed in an apparent murder-suicide had complained
of unwanted advances from the manager of the Chatham store who
died with her. 
<P>
Police say 56-year-old Theresa Vince made an informal complaint
to Sears officials, but decided to deal with the matter on her
own. 
<P>
The bodies of Vince and 57-year-old Russell Davis were discovered
on Sunday. Vince was about to retire. 
<HR>

<H3>Russian Spies </H3>

<P>
A man and woman accused by the federal government of spying for
Russia say they just want to go home. The pair, who used the names
Ian and Laurie Lambert, made the announcement at a federal court
hearing in Toronto. 
<P>
Next comes a deportation hearing, but that is seen as a mere formality
and the pair could be back in their homeland by week's end. At
this point, the details of the government's case against the accused
spies remains under wraps. 
<HR>

<H3>Russia/Chechnya </H3>

<P>
In Moscow meanwhile, Russian and Chechen negotiators are meeting
for a second day to try to enforce a four-day old cease-fire.
And in the war-torn streets of Grozny... peace is still far from
reality. 
<HR>

<H3>Habitat Beirut </H3>

<P>
The once flourishing economic center of the middle east is slowly
being rebuilt. Only long term stability will return Beirut to
its former status.

<H3>Auto Insurance </H3>

<P>
The Harris government, today gutted the &quot;no-fault&quot; auto
insurance plan put in place by the former NDP government. 
<P>
The new legislation would cut accident victim's benefits by more
than half, and get tough on un-insured drivers. 
<HR>

<H3>Baby Shot </H3>

<P>
An Ottawa-area infant remains in intensive care in critical but
stable condition after apparently being shot in the head. 
<P>
Police say a woman in her 20's gave birth to the baby boy in her
bathroom Thursday afternoon. The infant was taken to hospital,
first in Carleton Place and then Ottawa, after the father came
home a few hours later. 
<P>
The Ottawa Citizen and Ottawa Sun both quote sources as saying
a bullet was found in the baby's head. Police won't confirm the
reports.
<HR>

<H3>House Explosion </H3>

<P>
Police are probing the causes of house fires this morning in two
separate parts of the province. 
<P>
In Kingston, an early morning blaze destroyed a frame home and
two cars parked in the driveway. Damage is estimated at 100 thousand
dollars. 
<P>
And in Kitchener, one person was injured this morning when an
explosion ripped through a duplex. 
<HR>

<H3>Palma </H3>

<P>
The man accused of gunning down three prostitutes made his first
court appearance in Toronto this morning. Marcello Palma has been
remanded in custody until his next appearance June 18th. 
<P>
The 30 year old Palma, was brought back to Toronto yesterday from
Halifax, where he was arrested during the weekend. He faces three
counts of first-degree murder in connection with the deaths of
19-year-old Shawn Keegan, 31-year-old Thomas &quot;Deanna&quot;
Wilkinson and 25-year-old Brenda Ludgate. They were all found
shot to death May 20th. 
<HR>

<H3>Truck Check </H3>

<P>
Truckers across North America encountered unexpected safety checks
today. Roadcheck '96 began at midnight and will continue across
Canada, the US. and Mexico for 72 hours. 
<P>
250 ministry of transport inspectors are checking trucks in Ontario
in the &quot;round the clock&quot; enforcement blitz. Transportation
Minister Al Palladini says many truckers operate safe vehicles,
and those who don't will be forced off the road. 
<HR>

<H3>Kingston </H3>

<P>
Changes are in the works for Canada's women's prisons. Solicitor
General Herb Gray is appointing a deputy commissioner to oversee
women's prisons. All federal facilities will also get women's
emergency response teams -- and one, as yet unnamed, prison will
be staffed by female guards. 
<P>
The changes follow the riot at the women's prison in Kingston
and the strip search of several inmates by male guards. 
<HR>

<H3>Israel Meeting </H3>

<P>
Outgoing Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres has met with his
successor Benjamin Netanyahu. It's their first meeting since Peres'
defeat in national elections last week. 
<P>
The two men discussed the Handover of power. Army and intelligence
officers have already started to brief Netanyahu on security matters.

<HR>

<H3>Jet Down </H3>

<P>
An investigation is under way into the downing of a US fighter-bomber
by a Japanese naval destroyer. The plane was towing a target during
military exercises about 25-hundred kilometres west of Hawaii,
when it was hit. 
<P>
A spokesman for Japan's navy, says a problem with a rapid-fire
weapon system is suspected. The two people aboard the jet ejected
safely and were picked up in good condition by a rescue helicopter.

<HR>

<H3>Tianamen Anniversary </H3>

<P>
It's the seventh anniversary of the day Chinese tanks crushed
pro-democracy rallies in Beijing. Today, Tianamen Square was filled
with people, but only one woman tried to lay flowers at a monument
-- and she was dragged away. 
<HR>

<H3>Harris-Port Weller </H3>

<P>
Port Weller Dry Docks in St. Catharines was celebrating today.
A dedication ceremony was held for the 18 million dollar refit
of the Captain Henry Jackman. 
<P>
This is the first bulk carrier to be dedicated on the great lakes
since 1990. The ship is named after Ontario lieutenant governor
Hal Jackman's grandfather. Jackman and premier Mike Harris were
on hand for the ceremony.

<P>
Marcello Palma is back in Toronto. The man accused of shooting
to death three Toronto prostitutes on the Victoria Day weekend
landed at Pearson Airport this afternoon. 
<P>
He had been escorted by police from Halifax, where he was arrested
Saturday. A police van was waiting on the tarmac to whisk Palma
away to process him on the first-degree murder charges he faces.
Palma has a bail hearing scheduled for tomorrow. 
<HR>

<H3>Sears Murder Suicide </H3>

<P>
Police in Chatham have released the names of two people killed

The bodies of 57-year-old Russell Davis and 56-year-old Theresa
Vince were found in the offices of the store in downtown Chatham.
Police say it looks like Vince died of multiple gunshot wounds,

belonged to Davis. 
<HR>

<H3>Ontario - YOA </H3>

<P>
The Ontario government is asking Ottawa to make significant changes
in the Young Offenders Act, and to get tough with criminal kids.
The changes would see children under the age of 18 become far
more accountable to the law. 
<HR>

<H3>Deadbeat Parents </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, the Ontario government is planning changes to make
it tougher for so called &quot;deadbeat parents&quot; to escape
their responsibilities. 
<P>
A published report indicates the move would help children get
court-ordered money due to them. And that the government is prepared
to boost the number of enforcement officers and increase the number
and authority of workers manning telephone assistance lines. 
<P>
Attorney General Charles Harnick is expected to take the proposals
before cabinet for approval later this month. 
<HR>

<H3>Crime Convention </H3>

<P>
Police officers from across the continent have gathered in Niagara
Falls for the annual Crime Stoppers convention. And as Lauran
Sabourin reports the program's goal is to have more citizens putting
even more criminals behind bars. 
<P>
<I>In the 20 years that Crime Stoppers has been in operation tips
from citizens have helped solve over 555 thousand felony cases.
And helped recover 3.2 billion dollars in property and narcotics.
</I>
<P>
<I>Impressive statistics. But critics charge that Crime Stoppers
is nothing but a police snitch line. People are reluctant to come
forward out of fear of retaliation from the accused. And out of
frustration over the demands the justice system puts on witnesses.
</I>
<P>
<I>In Niagara region alone the calls to are up significantly.
Criminal convictions as a result of Crime Stoppers tips are up.</I>

<P>
Canada has set up a national toll free number for tips. Instead
of calling your local office the number to call now is <B>1-800-222-TIPS
(8477)</B>. Your information will be directed to your local police
force. 
<HR>

<H3>Outlaws Arrest </H3>

<P>
In a continuing crackdown on motorcycle gangs Niagara police have
laid additional charges against an outlaws gang member. 
<P>

related charges. Longval was arrested last month during a police
sweep of biker hangouts. 
<HR>

<H3>Hostage Standoff </H3>

<P>
The woman held hostage in her home near Cranbrook, British Columbia
last week says she feels sorry for the young man and woman who
held her captive. 
<P>
Leanne Campbell, who is nine months pregnant, says the pair wound
up in trouble because of their childhood. The suspects made a
court appearance today and were remanded to July 8th to face several
charges, including unlawful confinement and attempted murder.

<P>
The hostage taking came to a peaceful end Saturday morning. 
<HR>

<H3>Ipperwash Economy </H3>

<P>
The camping season is upon us, and tourist operators at Ipperwash
say it doesn't seem like it... the area surrounding one of the
most beautiful waterfront parks is suffering from a double whammy:
a long recession and fears over last summers' troubles with local
natives... the lack of business is costing the area millions.

<HR>

<H3>Quebec Rally Charges </H3>

<P>
A senior official of the federal Liberal party has been charged
under Quebec's Referendum law for hiring buses to take &quot;no&quot;
supporters to a unity rally in Montreal last fall. 
<P>
Aurele Gervais -- the party's communications director -- faces
possible fines amounting to five-thousand dollars. 
<HR>

<H3>Arafat Major </H3>

<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat today said he &quot;respects
the choice of the Israeli people.&quot; Arafat arrived in London
for a two-day visit. 
<P>
British officials say prime minister John Major will have some
reassuring words for Arafat, about the continuation of the peace
process. 
<P>
Also today, US president Clinton has written Arafat, along with
the leaders of Jordan, Syria, and Egypt, re-stating US commitment
to peace. 
<HR>

<H3>New Netanyahu </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, a decidedly more diplomatic tone from Israel's prime
minister-elect. Benjamin Netanyahu has put hard-line supporters
on notice, saying he is in charge of policy. 
<P>
There were indications that Israel would now cancel all deals
with the Palestinians, but aides say Netanyahu won't do that.

<HR>

<H3>Kennedy Sworn </H3>

<P>
Former Toronto food bank director Gerard Kennedy has taken his
seat in the Ontario legislature. Kennedy was sworn in this morning
after winning the York south by-election last month. He has been
named the Liberal Associate Critic for both Consumer and Commercial
Relations and for Housing. 
<P>
Kennedy is seen by many political observers as a strong candidate
for the Liberal party leadership. Lyn McLeod has said she'll step
down as leader at a party convention this fall.

<H3>Holidays Act </H3>

<P>
Christmas shopping could take on a whole new meeting in Ontario...
the law that makes it illegal for most Ontario stores to open
on statutory holidays has been ruled unconstitutional. 
<P>
Judge H.W. Silverman of the Ontario Court of Justice ruled today
the Retail Business Holidays Act violates the Charter of Rights
and Freedoms by forcing stores to close on holidays. Silverman
calls the &quot;forbidden days&quot; in the act an &quot;irrational,
illogical, unreasonable&quot; restriction on business activity
and workers' rights to earn a livelihood. 
<P>
Silverman was ruling on a charges of opening on a statutory holiday
leveled against two drugstore chains, Hy and Zel's and Herbies,
plus the Kitchen Table chain of food stores. 
<P>
The act prohibits most stores from opening on Christmas Day, Boxing
Day, and six other holidays. The act was amended several years
ago to allow Sunday shopping. 
<P>
Defence lawyer Tim Danson says he hopes the government won't appeal
the decision. The solicitor general's office says it will review
the decision. 
<HR>

<H3>Hostage Latest </H3>

<P>
The hostage crisis in BC is into day three and no sign of letting
up yet... the doctor of the pregnant young woman being held hostage
is posted outside the house near Cranbrook where his patient is
being held. 
<P>
Dr. Edgar Turski says he is worried about Leanna Campbell, but
if he had to pick a patient to go through this ordeal, he would
have chosen her because of her strong character. Campbell is nine
months pregnant and due to give birth any time now. 
<P>
She is the prisoner of a 21-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman
who are wanted for violent robberies in Alberta. They shot and
hit a police officer in the chest as they took Campbell's home
by siege. He has recovered. 
<P>
The latest demand from the hostage takers is to see the newspaper
coverage of their story. 
<HR>

<H3>Seized Vehicle </H3>

<P>
Metro Toronto police have issued an appeal for triple murder suspect
Marcello Palma to surrender. And they are denying reports that
they think Palma has fled to Italy. Palma is wanted in connection
with three prostitute killings in Toronto on May 20th. 
<P>
Last night Toronto police towed away a red pickup truck owned
by Palma. The truck was located in an industrial park in Concord,
northwest of Toronto. 
<P>
Police have a Canada wide warrant out for Palma, and are concentrating
on the Montreal area, as they know he has a brother there. 
<HR>

<H3>Russian Spies </H3>

<P>
A hearing date has been set in the Russian spy case. A Toronto
couple will appear in federal court in Toronto next Wednesday.

<P>
Lawyers for Laurie and Ian Lambert will argue their arrest and
detention is unconstitutional. If the federal court agrees the
government has enough evidence to prove the two are spies, they
will face a deportation hearing. 
<HR>

<H3>Netanyahu </H3>

<P>
Palestinians say they expect Israel's new prime minister to honor
Israel's commitments in peace agreements. It's the first official
response from the Palestinians to the election of right-winger
Benjamin Netanyahu as Israeli prime minister. 
<P>
A Palestinian cabinet minister says Yasser Arafat's government
won't re-negotiate anything. But just what that will mean isn't
certain. 
<HR>

<H3>Irish Peace </H3>

<P>
Britain and Ireland say an Irish Republican Army cease-fire is
still a must -- before its political allies sit at talks on Northern
Ireland's future. 
<P>
The party, Sinn Fein, has done well in an election held to determine
who takes part in the peace talks. 
<HR>

<H3>King City Summit </H3>

<P>
There won't be any scrums outside a meeting of world leaders being
held in king city ... newspaper magnate Conrad Black is holding
a secret summit of international big wigs including the Queens
of Netherlands and Spain, and our own Prime Minister. 
<P>
It's the annual Bildeberg's Conference, and we'll not know what
it's all about, because participants must take an oath of silence.

<HR>

<H3>Cuts-Growth </H3>

<P>
A University of Toronto study predicts Ontario will lose thousands
of jobs over the next three years. And that the government's tax
cuts will slow down economic growth. 
<HR>

<H3>Fergus Rescue </H3>

<P>
A dramatic river rescue has captured headlines this week... we
have a first hand account from the chief of police who put his
life on the line to help save a little girl trapped in a dam in
Fergus. 
<HR>

<H3>Ozone </H3>

<P>
The manmade chemical assault on the atmosphere's ozone layer is
beginning to ease and researchers say the ozone hole high above
the earth should start closing within 10 years. 
<P>
Ground level readings show a decline in the amount of ozone-destroying
chemicals in the air for the first time since the compounds were
put into common use more than 30 years ago. 
<HR>

<H3>Leary Obit </H3>

<P>
Timothy Leary has dropped out, for good. The Harvard professor
turned guru of  LSD who encouraged the '60s generation to &quot;turn
on, tune in, and drop out,&quot; died in Los Angeles. 
<P>
The seventy five year old Leary was suffering from cancer. When
he learned of his terminal illness, he said he was looking forward
to death as the ultimate trip. 
<P>
A close of Leary's says they will try to launch his remains into
outer space. 
<HR>

<H3>WCB Demo </H3>

<P>
The Mike Harris government is determined to go ahead with changes
to the Workers Compensation Board. 
<P>
Cam Jackson, the minister responsible for the board, says its
in serious financial trouble. But, injured workers say he's wrong.
That story from Dwight Ryan. 
<P>
<I>Injured workers aren't happy with proposed changes to the Workers
Compensation Board. They claim that the WCB is not experiencing
financial difficulties, that in fact it has billions of dollars.
Still the government claims unfunded liabilities, the difference
between the board's assets, and the cost of its obligations to
injured workers, is nearly eleven billion dollars. </I>
<P>
<I>Vince Bellerba was injured on the job ten years ago. He doesn't
buy the government argument. </I>
<P>
<I>Jackson meanwhile promises that injured workers and others
will have a chance to offer input before any changes are made.
</I>

<H3>Hostage Taking </H3>

<P>
It's a waiting game for the mounties in southeastern BC. An armed
couple -- sought in connection with violent crimes in Alberta
-- is holding a pregnant woman hostage in a home outside Cranbrook.

<P>
RCMP sergeant Peter Montague says the main concern is the delicate
condition of hostage Leanne Campbell. Her baby is due in about
a week. 
<P>
The standoff began yesterday after a Mountie wearing a bullet-proof
vest was shot and wounded as he approached the house. 
<HR>

<H3>Palma Wanted </H3>

<P>
A continent wide warrant has been issued for a man wanted in connection
with the slaying of three Toronto prostitutes. 
<P>
Police are seeking 30-year-old Marcello Palma of Toronto. Palma
is married and the father of a 15-month-old child. 
<P>
The three prostitutes were shot to death in downtown Toronto during
the Victoria Day weekend. Police say Palma, who is considered
armed and dangerous, may be heading to Montreal. 
<HR>

<H3>Baltovich Denies </H3>

<P>
A Toronto man who has spent five years in prison for the murder
of his former girlfriend, says he didn't do it and is now pointing
a finger at Paul Bernardo. 
<P>
Papers filed with the Ontario Court of Appeal, include fresh evidence
in the case of Robert Baltovich who was convicted of second-degree
murder in the presumed death of Elizabeth Bain. Bain vanished
in 1990 ... her body was never found. 
<P>
The new evidence submitted last week does not name Bernardo, but
it makes reference to evidence presented at a trial concerning
the Scarborough rapist. Bernardo has admitted to a string of assaults
blamed on the Scarborough rapist -- the last about the time Bain
vanished. 
<HR>

<H3>Mcdonough-GST</H3>

<P>
In the federal by-election in Hamilton east, New Democrats claim
to be in second spot behind Sheila Copps. 
<P>
Today, the federal NDP leader came to Hamilton to help with the
campaign. While here, Alexa Mcdonough unveiled her party's plan
to get rid of the tax that triggered the by-election... the dreaded
GST. 
<P>
<I>Hamilton labour leader Wayne Marston wants to be the federal
member of parliament for Hamilton east. And he thinks the June
17th by-election caused by the sudden resignation of Sheila Copps
is his ticket. </I>
<P>
<I>Marston was joined in the campaign by federal party leader
Alexa Mcdonough. They canvassed the riding saying a vote for Sheila
is a vote for the GST. </I>
<P>
<I>At an earlier news conference, Mcdonough unveiled a four point
NDP program to kill the federal sales tax. Stop the proposed harmonization
which she says favours corporations. Ease the burden immediately
by removing the tax from items such as new homes and kids clothes.
A family of four would save 270 dollars a year. Undertake a national
taxation review. And as a first step, further ease the burden
by dropping the GST to five percent. </I>
<P>
<I>They know that in a field of 13 candidates, being number two
doesn't count.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Israel Elect </H3>

<P>
Israeli opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu promises peace talks
won't end if he takes power. He has a slim lead in Israel's election
for prime minister. 
<P>
Netanyahu is expected to slow the pace of negotiations. But he
says he'll honor all signed agreements. 
<HR>

<H3>N. Ireland Elect </H3>

<P>
Protestants and Catholics in northern Ireland took part today
in elections which were meant to find a way to peace. The vote
was held to decide which parties should represent them in northern
Ireland's long-delayed peace negotiations. But there was little
optimism evident as voters battled driving rain and gusting winds
to trudge into polling stations. 
<P>
The vote count won't take place until tomorrow. 
<HR>

<H3>Royal Divorce </H3>

<P>
Andrew and Fergie are officially single again. Following a ten
year, highly publicized marriage, the Duke and Duchess of York
received a final decree of divorce today.

Ontario premier Mike Harris and attorney general Charles Harnick

by police. 
<HR>

<H3>Reform </H3>

<P>
As we reported earlier... Reform party leader Preston Manning
parachuted into Hamilton east today in support of local by-election
candidate Andy Sweck. 
<P>
He met with polish business leaders at a Barton Street restaurant...
telling them that the campaign is about jobs, crime and political
accountability.

Later, he told students at Scott Park Secondary School that the
Young Offenders Act needs a major overhaul... that teen-aged criminals
prey on teen-aged victims.

incumbent Shimon Peres has a slight advantage over challenger
Benjamin Netanyahu. The exit polls also indicate the Labor party

<H3>Shuttle Returns </H3>

<P>
The Space Shuttle &quot;endeavour&quot; and its six astronauts
had a picture perfect landing in Florida this morning. 
<P>
The 10-day mission which included Canadian mission specialist
Marc Garneau, was highlighted by the release of two test satellites.
Patchy ground fog and clouds over the landing site, had threatened
to delay the landing or send the shuttle to Edwards Air Force
Base in California. But the weather cleared and mission control
in Houston gave the go-ahead for its Florida return.

The best way to find out about safety on the highways ... is to
ask the people who drive them, every day. That's what the OPP
is doing, this month. 
<P>
They began this morning, on the 401 near Kitchener; with a safety
survey blitz, that will last until June 25th. 
<HR>

<H3>Brant-Reform/Tory </H3>

<P>
Members of Canada's political right wing met over the weekend
in Alberta. Despite the absence of Tory and Reform leaders, delegates
agreed that the only way to beat the liberals in the next federal
election is to join forces. 
<P>
As Dwight Ryan reports, the testing ground will be the riding
of Brant, where Tories and conservatives will unite to field one
candidate. 
<P>
<I>It was a sad night for the political right. In October of 1993,
Canada made a turn to the left. The once powerful federal Tories
were reduced to just two, liberal Jean Chretien would be prime
minister with a commanding majority. </I>
<P>
<I>But those further to the right, the western based Reformers
were also celebrating. Now, three years later, the Reformers are
shooting themselves in the feet and their credibility with many
voters is at an all time low. </I>
<P>
<I>Tory leader Jean Charest travels the country trying to convince
us that his party will return. For the time being, he and his
one fellow Conservative sit silent in the house, denied official
party status. But what if the Tories and the Reformers were to
join forces. </I>
<P>
<I>Riding Association president Jeff Coles has just returned from
the winds of change conference in Alberta. He says a combined
candidate makes perfect political sense. </I>
<P>
<I>The prospect of facing a combined opposition in the next federal
election doesn't phase the popular current member, revenue minister
Jane Stewart.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Stowaways </H3>

<P>
A Taiwanese ship, that may have been the scene of three murders,
is free to leave Canada, at any time. However, eight crew members
and a Romanian hostage, are seeking to remain in Canada, rather
than the depart with the ship. 
<P>
The group told Canadian authorities a horrific tale of how three
stowaways were murdered on board the ship. Two were set adrift
on a raft made of oil drums; a third was apparently tossed overboard,
on the high seas. The fourth stowaway, was discovered, and sheltered
by crew members, who now want off the boat. 
<P>
The RCMP is frantically seeking a legal method to hold the ship,
and charge those responsible. But, because the alleged crimes
were committed on the high seas; Canadian authorities say, they
have no jurisdiction to stop the ship from departing Canada. 
<P>
At the moment, they are talking to authorities in Taiwan, to see
if the country that owns the ship will intervene, and request
Canadian involvement. 
<HR>

<H3>Somalia-Sentence </H3>

<P>
A commanding officer in the Canadian Airborne Regiment has been
sentenced to three months in jail, for his part in the Somalia
affair. Major Tony Seward, will also be drummed out of the military.

<P>
Seward was convicted of negligent performance of duty in 1994;
for telling his troops that they could abuse prisoners taken in
Somalia, during a UN peacekeeping mission in 1993. 
<P>
Seward was originally sentenced to a severe reprimand by court
martial. But prosecutors appealed the sentence as too lenient;
and won jail time. Seward is the first and only officer so far,
to be jailed for the beating, torture and murder of a 16 year
old Somalia boy by Canadian soldiers. 
<HR>

<H3>Quebec-Referendum </H3>

<P>
The issue is closed, according to Quebec's chief returning officer
... but Alliance Quebec; the anglophone rights group, isn't satisfied.

<P>
Pierre Cote, today released his report on irregularities in the
Quebec referendum. More than 86-thousand rejected ballots: ...
most of them, &quot;no&quot; votes, were reported, but Cote concluded
that the spoiled ballots were a less significant threat to democracy
... than the huge federalist rally held in downtown Montreal,
just three days before the vote. 
<P>
Alliance Quebec has rejected the report, and is demanding a full
government investigation, of the matter. 
<HR>

<H3>Swimsuits </H3>

<P>
It's official. May 24th has passed, and the summer swimsuit season
is upon us. If that strikes fear and dread into your heart, you
are not alone. 
<P>
Although the industry sells more than a billion dollars worth
of swim wear every year; most of it to women ... those who buy
the suits ... do so, with great reluctance.

<HR>

<H3>Kennedy-Liberals </H3>

<P>
The Ontario Tories received a vote of non-confidence in the first
by-election since they came to power. Instead, the voters in the
Toronto area riding of York South elected a liberal. It's the
riding which used to be held by former NDP leader Bob Rae. 
<P>
Yesterday's winner is Gerard Kennedy. He's a political newcomer,
but his name is already being mentioned as a potential candidate
for leader.
<HR>

<H3>Chretien Poll </H3>

<P>
The prime minister is downplaying a bad-news poll out today. Jean
Chretien says he doesn't work around the polls. 
<P>
The Gallup Survey marks the first time since Chretien became prime
minister in 1993, that fewer than half of Canadians polled approved
of his handling of the job. It suggests that 47 per cent of Canadians
approve of the government's performance, compared with 36 per
cent who disapprove. 
<HR>

<H3>Mulroney - Court </H3>

<P>
Federal lawyers must file their statement of defence as ordered
by the judge in Brian Mulroney's 50-million dollar libel suit.

<P>
A bid by federal authorities for a postponement has been rejected
in the Quebec Court of Appeal. Lawyers representing the federal
government feared outlining their defence, would hinder the RCMP
investigation into the airbus affair. But justice Marie Deschamps
threw out the request, saying the arguments weren't convincing.

<HR>

<H3>CBC </H3>

<P>
The budget-ravaged CBC now turns to fine-tuning a leaner future.
The public broadcaster reached last-minute contract deals with
its three unions early today, narrowly averting a strike by seven-thousand
employees. 
<P>
Terms of the tentative contracts were not disclosed. Job security
was the major issue during negotiations, specifically CBC demands
for more contracting-out. 
<HR>

<H3>Life Expectancy </H3>

<P>
The latest survey from Statistics Canada shows Canadian life expectancy
was at an all time high in 1994. But despite the fact that people
are living longer the cancer rates are soaring. 
<HR>

<H3>Food Moods </H3>

<P>
At one time or another, many of us have turned to a special food
or beverage when we're feeling a little low. Food can affect your
mood, by influencing chemicals in the brain. One of the best snacks
for a good night's sleep is cereal, milk and a banana.
<HR>

<H3>Personal Ponds</H3>

<P>
Aquatic animals are evaporating. Study after study shows fish,
frogs and other creatures are disappearing.. as animals lose habitat
to development. But some people are trying to give a little space
back to wildlife-- right in their own backyards. 
<P>

<H3>Foreman Evng</H3>

<P>
A jury has convicted a former Kitchener nursing student of first-degree
murder in the shotgun slaying of his ex-girlfriend. 
<P>
Joan Heimbecker died of multiple gunshot wounds, in her McMaster
University residence two years ago. Joan's family and friends,
who faithfully attended the month-long trial in Hamilton, wept
as 25-year-old Rory Foreman was pronounced guilty. 
<P>
Before he was sentenced to life in prison, Foreman apologized
in court to Joan's parents and sister, saying Joan's murder was
a selfish, cruel and cowardly act.
<HR>

<H3>Burloak Evng </H3>

<P>
Police say a 14-year-old Burlington boy charged with murdering
another teen knew the victim. The accused was charged after the
body of 14-year-old Lee Doherty was found yesterday in an Oakville
park. 
<P>
Police say Doherty was beaten to death with a blunt object, probably
a crow bar. 
<HR>

<H3>Hooker Evng </H3>

<P>
Hookers working the streets of downtown Toronto say they're living
in fear after the deaths of three prostitutes. 
<P>
Police say a 25 year old woman, a male transvestite and a transsexual
hooker were all shot, with the same gun -- execution-style in
the back of the head. Police say it's too early to say a serial
killer is on the streets, but they won't rule it out. 
<HR>

<H3>York South - Debt </H3>

<P>
Mike Harris and his common sense revolution are facing the first
test at the polls. A provincial by-election is taking place today
in the riding last held by former NDP leader Bob Rae. 
<P>
The candidates for the major parties are Conservative Rob Davis,
Liberal Gerard Kennedy and New Democrat David Miller. The by-election
is seen as a test of the popularity of the Harris cuts in taxes
and spending.
<HR>

<H3>CUPE - Ontario Labour </H3>

<P>
The labor movement meanwhile, isn't going to sit idly by and watch
the government turn back the clock 50 years. That was the message
Canadian Labor Congress president Bob White delivered at the Canadian
Union of Public Employees convention in Niagara Falls today.
<HR>

<H3>CBC - Negotiations</H3>

<P>
It's getting down to the eleventh hour for the CBC and seven-thousand
radio and t-v workers. A strike deadline will hit at one minute
before midnight and there's still no contract agreement. 
<P>
Workers are protesting the broadcaster's plans to contract out
more work in its effort to cut costs.
<HR>

<H3>Euthanasia Nurses </H3>

<P>
A new study says some critical care nurses actively help their
patients die. That in spite of the fact that such activities may
violate professional ethics or the law. But the research is being
angrily disputed.

<HR>

<H3>Harnick - Crowns </H3>

<P>
The province's crown attorneys say they are busier than ever with
not enough staff and too much work. Still, the attorney general
says they won't be exempt from provincial cutbacks. 
<P>
But Charles Harnick told a Guelph audience today that rumours
of massive layoffs are just that ...rumours. Dwight Ryan has that
story. 
<P>
<I>Ontario's attorney general has unveiled a blueprint for change
for Ontario's justice system. The province's crown attorneys have
been on pins and needles since the Tories came to power nearly
a year ago. They know that thousands of civil servants are to
lose their jobs...and they know that their ministry isn't exempt.
</I>
<P>
<I>They also know that they're up to the necks in work. Harnick
admits they're not having an easy time of it. But still the rumours
persist that Ontario's prosecutors will face massive layoffs.
</I>
<P>
<I>Harnick says more will be done to help victims of crime and
that his government will refocus its resources on serious and
violent crime. </I>
<P>
<I>The attorney general assured crown attorneys that they'll have
an important role in deciding what changes are made.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Grand River Rising </H3>

<P>
Flood levels in the grand river continue to rise with the crest
expected to reach Caledonia at seven p.m. tonight and Dunnville
by seven a.m. tomorrow morning. 
<P>
As Kathy Renwald reports the flood damage has been confined to
low lying areas, but the fast flowing river poses a serious threat
to safety for recreational users. 
<P>
<I>The Lafortune Campground on the Grand River is an unfortunate
place to be for trailer owners. The trailers are nearly up to
their axles in alligators. </I>
<P>
<I>In Middleport the river washes against the trunk of trees,
and dandelions are floating at the waters surface. </I>
<P>
<I>Underneath the Lorne Bridge in Brantford the Grand River races
by during its crest at midday. Its flowing 29 times faster than
the average summer volume. There is no urban flooding predicted,
but the Grand River Conservation Authority is doing all it can
to manage dams and maintain flood storage. </I>
<P>
<I>Before the weekends story Jim Reid said he was fishing in the
Grand in a spot where water was just to his knee now he says the
water there has risen to three times his height. </I>
<P>
<I>The authority now says that fishing and canoeing on the grand
during this high water peak is foolish.. still the allure of the
water on a spring day is strong ..this student waded into the
grand river.. not for a picnic ..but for a peaceful place to study.
With sporadic rain in the forecast, the conservation authority
will remain on flood alert.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Jobs-Health </H3>

<P>
New research shows that just thinking you might lose your job,
can make you sick... literally. The university study suggests
that things like high blood pressure, allergy symptoms, arthritis,
heart disease, and mental illness &quot;all increase in workers
whose jobs are threatened or lost&quot;. 
<P>
Environment Canada was so worried about this that it hired an
expert to counsel employees during a recent downsizing. 
<HR>

<H3>Mitral Valve </H3>

<P>
It can cause chest pain, a racing heart and fatigue, but it's
not a heart attack. It affects mostly women and symptoms can often
be written off as &quot;all in her head.&quot; But in fact, the
cause is an abnormality of the heart known as Mitral Valve Prolapse.

<HR>

<H3>Foam Homes </H3>

<P>
For years now, builders have been looking for new ways to make
their homes more earth-friendly and energy-efficient. Those efforts
have sometimes resulted in homes that look pretty silly. Well,
now there's a new kind of home, one that saves wood, saves energy,
and looks normal.

<H3>Twister-Niagara </H3>

<P>
Environment Canada says at least one tornado and possibly more
hit the Niagara- Brantford- Hamilton areas during severe thunderstorms
last night. 
<P>
When it was all over buildings were destroyed, and trees were
toppled. Miraculously no one was seriously injured. 
<HR>

<H3>Timmins Flood </H3>

<P>
The hoped-for good news turned bad today for people in Timmins.
Residents were hoping the worst was over and the swollen Mattagami
River would start subsiding. But officials say the river will
rise further, before the situation gets any better. That means
more families may have to flee their homes. Twenty families have
already had to re-locate. 
<HR>

<H3>Transvestite Slaying </H3>

<P>
Police believe there is a connection in the slayings of two young
men whose bodies were found in the same downtown Toronto neighborhood.

<P>
Both men, who were dressed in women's clothing, were shot to death
overnight. One was found in a stairwell of an apartment building,
while the other was discovered behind another apartment building
on the same street. Police believe the victims were prostitutes.

<HR>

<H3>Garneau </H3>

<P>
A Canadian has pulled off the toughest job of the day today up
in space, retrieving a satellite that had been deployed yesterday.
And Marc Garneau carried out the task flawlessly with the help
of the Canadian built robot known as the &quot;Canadarm&quot;.
<HR>

<H3>Debit Cards </H3>

<P>
A recent survey shows more and more Canadians are using debit
cards to pay for their purchases. 
<P>
New statistics indicate that the number of debit card transactions
has doubled over the past year.
<HR>

<H3>S.F. Quake </H3>

<P>
An earthquake has rattled much of northern California. The quake
jarred an area from Monterey Bay north to San Francisco and east
to Sacramento. 
<P>
The US geological survey puts the magnitude at 4.7 and the epicenter
about 15 kilometres east of San Jose. There is no immediate word
on damage or injuries. 
<HR>

<H3>Ferry Capsized </H3>

<P>
At least 500 people have drowned after a ferry hit a rock and
capsized in Lake Victoria, Africa. And survivors say many of the
victims were teenage students on their way home after the end
of school term. 
<P>
Radio Tanzania says only 40 people lived through the disaster.

<HR>

<H3>Mafia Arrests </H3>

<P>
Police have arrested one of Italy's most-wanted men, a reputed
Mafia terrorist. 
<P>
The man is thought to have killed a famous prosecutor and headed
the teams that planted car bombs that damaged a museum, two churches
and an art gallery in 1993. 
<HR>

<H3>Frozen Mummy </H3>

<P>
A frozen 500-year old mummy discovered in the mountains of Peru
was unveiled at National Geographic headquarters in Washington,
D.C. today. Scientists believe she gives the first look at the
life of Incan nobility...and their deadly rituals. 
<HR>

<H3>Correction </H3>

<P>
A correction tonight. 
<P>
On some of our newscasts yesterday, we incorrectly reported that
a &quot;rumble&quot; between rival motorcycle gangs broke out
at a Queens Park demonstration Sunday. In fact, there was a minor
altercation between two individual bike club members. 
<P>
We regret the mistake. 
<P>
The bikers were at Queens Park to protest what they call unfair
treatment by all levels of government.

<H3>Muskoka Storm </H3>

<P>
There was very little time for swimming, boating, tanning or even
fishing this long weekend as mother nature turned ugly on cottage
country. 
<P>
Gusting winds, thunderstorms and flooding were the norm making
this May 24th Victoria day weekend one to remember. 
<P>
<I>Cottagers and campers will be talking about this May long weekend
for years to come. Two violent storms systems passed through central
Ontario wreaking havoc. </I>
<P>
<I>On Saturday, high winds brought the roof came down on dozens
of boaters at crates marina in Orillia. The storm took out Hydro
to more than 10-thousand customers, six thousand in the Bancroft
area, and three to four thousand in the Muskoka, Huntsville and
Bracebridge areas. </I>
<P>
<I>Hundred more went without power because of lightening strikes
in Bruce County. Ontario Hydro hopes to have electricity restored
by later today. </I>
<P>
<I>A dozen children were sent to hospital after a severe thunderstorm
moved through Manitoulin Island. About 700 girl guides and boy
scouts from across the province were attending &quot;Rendezvous
96&quot;, a big camping expedition. The storm hit suddenly, knocking
down tents, old sheds and tree branches. Twelve of the children
suffered broken bones, sprained ankles, shock and hypothermia
but they weren't kept in hospital. </I>
<P>
<I>Timmins residents woke up to a higher Mattagami River today
-- 48 centimetres higher. Levels are expected to continue rising
because of the release of water from too-full Hydro dams and spring
runoff. The water is rising so quickly some wooden barricades
installed by police have floated away. Roads near the river are
flooded and some campers outside Timmins are stranded by washed-out
roads. Some flood-zone residents have left their homes but many
are staying put.</I>

<H3>Biker Follow </H3>

<P>
Two rival motorcycle gangs clashed at Queen's Park yesterday.

<P>
Members of the Paradice Riders and Satan's Choice began a peaceful
protest over what they see as discrimination against bikers. As
Lauran Sabourin reports, this incident comes a day after a clash
between police and the Paradice Riders in Niagara Falls. 
<P>
<I>The clash erupted after police tried to arrest a Paradice Rider
gang member. Police fired pepper spray into the angry mob of bikers.
Because of the high winds both police officers and bikers were
hit by the spray. </I>
<P>
<I>About 100 Paradice Riders arrived in Niagara Falls for an annual
long weekend party. Police warned the bikers and the public that
they would be keeping a watchful eye on the Paradice Riders. </I>
<P>
<I>The group was confronted by the police when they came off the
highway in the city. Cops checked the identification of each biker.
One charge of breach of recognizance was laid. </I>
<P>
<I>The Paradice Riders left the city Sunday morning.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Shuttle Endeavour </H3>

<P>
It was like watching a giant helium balloon inflate. Except this
one is in space, and it's filled with nitrogen gas. 
<P>
NASA's experimental, inflatable antenna swelled to its full shape
this morning, about two hours after the shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;'
released a satellite and the inflatable device. 
<P>
Canadian Marc Garneau and the shuttle's five other astronauts
watched the antenna inflate to the size of a tennis court. It's
hoped the 14-million-dollar experiment will be a model for future
inflatable spacecraft.
<HR>

<H3>FBI Explosion </H3>

<P>
Police in Laredo, Texas, are investigating an explosion outside
a building that houses the FBI. No one is reported injured. 
<P>
There's no word on the cause of the explosion, which blew out
windows but caused no structural damage. The FBI says it has no
evidence it was the target. 
<HR>

<H3>lee-Taiwan </H3>

<P>
Taiwan's president Lee Teng-Hui offered today to make a ``journey
of peace'' to China but rejected Beijing's demand to halt his
drive to raise the island's international profile. 
<P>
In his inaugural address after being sworn in as the first popularly
elected president, Lee repeated Taiwan's desire to reunite eventually
with China. 
<P>
Lee offered to hold a direct exchange with China's leaders to
open ``a new era of communication and co-operation'' between the
breakaway province and its ruling government in Beijing. 
<HR>

<H3>Iraq Oil </H3>

<P>
In a move expected to result in lower gasoline prices, Iraq finally
has agreed to a UN plan to sell some of its oil. 
<P>
Under the terms... Saddam Hussein may sell a billion dollars worth
of oil every 90 days, with the profits going toward food and medicine
for his people. 
<P>
The UN Security Council put a plug on Iraqi oil exports after
the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The UN Secretary General says the
new agreement is a win-win situation for all sides. 
<P>
Iraq could have had the same deal years ago. Nevertheless, it
was welcomed by Iraq's UN ambassador, who said Iraqi oil could
be flowing in a month.

<H3>Game Wars </H3>

<P>
The battle lines for the blaster buck are being re-drawn this

<H3>Gypsy Warning </H3>

<P>
May 24th. The Victoria day weekend. Today, summer begins in Canada
... unofficially. And the return of warm weather means two things:
allergy season, and a jump in street crime. 
<P>
Niagara Regional Police have issued a warning to tourist operators
in the falls, as the start of the lucrative tourist season, kicks
off. As Lauran Sabourin reports, professional pickpockets and
thieves have moved in to the honeymoon city and are preying on
unsuspecting victims. 
<P>
<I>The most recent incident occurred yesterday at a souvenir store
in the Skylon tower. An unsuspecting tourist, the man carrying
the black bag over his shoulder is jostled by three women. One
woman comes up behind him. Slits the bag with a knife and steals
his wallet and credit cards. </I>
<P>
<I>Niagara Falls furrier Barry Lang knows first hand how these
professional thieves operate. Last month two couples walked into
his Queen Street store. They distracted Lang by asking him to
calculate the GST rebate on a coat. This is a man whose store
in covered with surveillance cameras. Who has a keen eye for suspicious
behavior. And even he didn't see the woman stuff a full length
fur coat inside her coat. </I>
<P>
<I>With every trick these pickpockets use the cops are one step
behind them. While security personnel may be on the lookout for
pickpockets, the pickpockets are always on the lookout for victims.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Toronto Stabbing</H3>

<P>
In Toronto, there is increasing concern not only about crime;
but about who is committing the crime. A street fight ended with
the stabbing death of a 15-year-old Toronto boy last night. 
<P>
Witnesses say his attacker, was a young teen who taunted, and
cursed his dying victim. Andr&eacute; Matthews was pronounced
dead at hospital, with a stab wound to the throat. Police have
arrested and charged a 17-year-old young offender. Police say
the stabbing was likely sparked by a previous dispute. 
<HR>

<H3>Teen Rapist </H3>

<P>
Many blame the Young Offenders Act for the increase in crimes
committed by youth. 
<P>
Police say a 13-year-old metro girl has been raped -- but her
suspected assailant is too young to be charged with the crime.
They say an 11-year-old boy appeared unruffled when he was nabbed
yesterday. He apparently is fully aware of his rights, and calmly
told officers he was too young to be charged. 
<P>
Police say they have a thick file on the boy, and believe he's
responsible for a string of other crimes. They call the suspect
one of the &quot;untouchables&quot;; kids under the age of 12,
who cannot be charged under the Young Offenders Act. 
<HR>

<H3>Toronto Rape </H3>

<P>
In Ottawa, the case sparked a heated exchange in the commons,
between Reform party members, and the Liberal government. 
<P>
The government argued, that a commons committee is currently reviewing
the entire Young Offenders Act; and no matter how low the age
limit ... there will always be exceptions to the rule. The reformers:
however, slammed Ottawa, for not lowering the age for young offenders
earlier this year, when amendments to the act were passed in the
commons. 
<HR>

<H3>P4W</H3>

<P>
For those who can be charged under the law; prison is frequently
the end result. Until this year, there was only one prison for
women, in all of Canada. 
<P>
The Kingston Prison for Women is closing; to be replaced by five
regional centres. However, the opening of one of those centres:
in Kitchener, has now been delayed for a second time. 
<P>
The move follows severe security problems stemming from the opening
of a similar prison, in Edmonton. That has prompted a full security
review of the Kitchener facility.
<HR>

<H3>Niagara Bikers </H3>

<P>
In Niagara, police believe that they may have to make a few arrests,
this weekend. 
<P>
The Victoria Day holiday is a traditional time for motorcycle
gangs to get together; to celebrate the arrival of spring. However,
with increasing tensions between rival gangs in southern Ontario
... police are gearing up, for what could be a busy weekend. 
<HR>

<H3>Pinery </H3>

<P>
And another traditional gathering point for the May 24th celebration;
the Pinery, will close this weekend, for the first time in 57
years. that ... because of an ongoing dispute between the province,
and native groups occupying parts of the park. 
<P>
The natives say they have no intention of abandoning the areas
of the park, now under their control. As a result, the gates of
the park will remain firmly closed, over the weekend. 
<HR>

<H3>Senators </H3>

<P>
And the holiday weekend is also the time when thousands of Canadians
puff pot ... as part of their party ritual. 
<P>
Marijuana is still illegal in this country; but in Ottawa this
morning, the senate was busy trying to change that. A group of
Tory and Liberal senators who are members of the Commons Legal
and Constitutional Affairs Committee say; they will recommend
changes to current drug legislation, that would decriminalize
the possession of small amounts of marijuana, and hashish. 
<P>
The senators say, punishment for possession has failed as a deterrent;
and merely serves to clog up the court system. They believe that
education would be a better weapon in the fight against drug abuse.
<HR>

<H3>Niagara Heroes </H3>

<P>
Crime, is not all that is making news today, however. Heroism
has a part, as well. 
<P>
Three men from Niagara Falls have been honored in Ottawa. They
were presented this morning with medals of bravery for an incident
in Niagara Falls three years ago. 
<P>
Craig Garner, Raymond Gionet and William van Dongen tried to save
two children and a woman from being burned alive by her estranged
husband. He was holding his family hostage in a van, doused them
with gasoline and was threatening to light his lighter. 
<P>
Garner, Gionet and van Dongen pulled the two children to safety.
They got the woman out of the van just as her husband ignited
the gas. He died in the fire, and his estranged wife died later
of her injuries.

<HR>

<H3>Unity-Thursday </H3>

<P>
Unity ... has become the wound that will not heal ... here in
Canada ... and once again Quebec, and Ottawa ... are busy pouring
salt. 
<P>
Premier Lucien Bouchard appeared on ABC's &quot;Good Morning America&quot;,
this morning ... to take the offensive against prime minister
Jean Chretien. Bouchard told the audience that Chretien is in
complete disarray when it comes to the unity issue, and is desperately
trying to prevent a sovereigntist victory in Quebec. 
<P>
Chretien has said that Quebec cannot declare independence unilaterally,
and that a simple majority vote, will not be acceptable. Bouchard
says, those statements are simply &quot;awful&quot;. 
<P>
But in Ottawa; unity minister Stephane Dion stuck to the party
line, in reaction to Bouchard's interview. 
<HR>

<H3>Revolt </H3>

<P>
And yet another federal leader has problems of his own: the Toronto
Sun says, there's a move afoot to dump Preston Manning as the
leader of the federal Reform Party. 
<P>
But Manning and his supporters say, that's news to them. They
have dismissed the report saying it comes from disgruntled former
members of the Reform party. 
<HR>

<H3>Cayuga Missing </H3>

<P>
He's been missing for 13 years, but no one thought to notify police
about the disappearance of Robert Asher of Dunnville until February
of this year. As Kathy Renwald reports Cayuga OPP now have the
major crimes unit investigating the 13 year old mystery. 
<P>
<I>Robert Asher left Dunnville 13 years ago in a 1970 gold Pontiac
and there hasn't been a sighting of him since. </I>
<P>
<I>Cayuga OPP say he was estranged from his family ..left home
at 16 ..hung around in crash pads in downtown Dunnville. His parents
never reported him missing ..because he led a vagabond life. </I>
<P>
<I>But in February of this year 13 years after Robert Asher was
last seen police got a tip. Police admit this is the coldest of
trails, but anyone who has information on Robert Asher of Dunnville
is asked to call Cayuga OPP.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Casino Poll </H3>

<P>
Is a turf war developing in Niagara Falls over the awarding of
a casino? The opposition is being mounted by residents living
near the Maple Leaf Village Casino and businesses on the other
side of town. 
<HR>

<H3>Disabled Legislature </H3>

<P>
Dozens of disabled people jammed the Ontario legislature this
afternoon, in a bid to bring home a message to Mike Harris. 
<P>
Advocates for the disabled say the Tories have failed to keep
an election promise to provide new legislation to protect Ontario
residents with disabilities. They packed the public galleries
to support NDP justice critic Marion Boyd, as she introduced a
private member's resolution for an all-party debate on the proposed
Ontarians with Disabilities Act. The motion was passed unanimously.

<HR>

<H3>Parks Ban </H3>

<P>
And, a warning from the Ontario government for those planning
to spend the holiday weekend, camping in a provincial park. 
<P>
There will be a complete ban on alcohol in all 29 provincial parks
over the Victoria Day weekend. That includes Long Point, Turkey
Point, and the Pinery, in southwestern Ontario.

<H3>Child Abuse Case </H3>

<P>
Social services agencies responsible for children are in the spotlight
today... this after the verdict in what is being described as
&quot;the ultimate case of child abuse&quot;. 
<P>
A Toronto couple has been convicted of second-degree murder in
the April 1994 death of their six-month-old daughter. Court was
told Sara Podniewicz (pod'-nee-wits) suffered 24 broken bones,
including 16 ribs, that led to fatal pneumonia. 
<P>
Michael Podniewicz and Lisa Olsen, both crack addicts, face automatic
life sentences. The father had a record of child abuse... and
the family was on the books with social services.
<P>
The prosecutor in the case wants to know why the family wasn't
more closely monitored.
<HR>

<H3>QP Garden </H3>

<P>
More arrests at Queen's Park today... planting a vegetable garden
at the Ontario legislature landed six people in jail today. 
<P>
The members of Toronto Action for Social Change were charged with
mischief after rooting a few plants on the legislature lawn. Laura
Berman of Foodshare says gardens in city parks should be used
to grow vegetables instead of flowers since food banks don't provide
fresh produce. 
<P>
One of the men arrested called it a victory garden, saying the
Harris government is waging a war against the poor. 
<HR>

<H3>Welfare Caseload </H3>

<P>
Queen's Park won't be taking &quot;no&quot; for an answer when
it comes to Workfare. Communities refusing to take part in the
province's work for welfare benefits program could see their social
services funding cut off. 
<P>
Some communities, including Ottawa, Kingston and Hamilton, are
digging in their heels, saying they won't participate in Workfare.
But a social services ministry official says it's &quot;a mandatory
program&quot; and municipalities who don't comply will be cut
off. 
<P>
Meanwhile, Ontario's welfare rolls are getting smaller. The province
reports the number of people on social assistance dropped for
the ninth month in a row in march. There are still 1.2-million
people in Ontario on welfare. But social services minister David
Tsubouchi says the number has dropped by 129-thousand since last
June. 
<HR>

<H3>CBC Deadline </H3>

<P>
In just over one week, seven thousand employees at the CBC could
be on strike. That's the strike deadline set by the corp.'s three
unions after a decision was made not to put the latest contract
offer to the workers. 
<P>
Canadian Media Guild spokesman Dan Oldfield says the unions hope
it won't come down to a strike, but he calls the public broadcaster's
last and best offer a &quot;folly.&quot; 
<P>
CBC president Perrin Beatty says he has no plans to lock employees
out. And acting heritage minister Lucienner Robillard says she
will not interfere in the bargaining process. 
<HR>

<H3>Chretien </H3>

<P>
Prime Minister Chretien told a big American and Canadian TV audience
this morning that Canada isn't likely to use force to keep Quebec
in confederation. 
<P>
He reiterated his assertion to ABC TV's &quot;Good Morning America&quot;
that he would not accept a vote of 50 per cent plus one from Quebeckers
to secede. But he said a clear vote on a clear question would
mean that Quebec could separate peacefully. 
<P>
Yesterday in the commons, Chretien stressed Quebec wouldn't be
allowed to leave Canada without agreement from the rest of the
country. 
<HR>

<H3>Boating Inquest </H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris agrees with an inquest jury that it is about
time the province consider licensing boaters ... but he says it's
an issue complicated by age and native rights. 
<P>
An inquest into the boating deaths of two Mississauga teens has
resulted in recommendations for sweeping changes to recreational
boating. The coroner's jury would like to see licensing and mandatory
training for boat operators. 
<P>
The two Mississauga girls were killed on the Trent Severn Waterway
in 1991 when a personal watercraft crashed into their canoe. 
<P>
The jury says government should regulate boating and develop legislation
similar to the highway traffic act. Right now, there are few restrictions
on who can operate a vessel. 
<HR>

<H3>Bicycle Deaths </H3>

<P>
Two nine-year-old Newmarket boys are in critical condition in
hospital after the bike they were both on was struck by a car.

<P>
The boys were thrown five metres by the impact. They were rushed
to Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children with severe head injuries.

<P>
Witness Alan Tough says he saw the boys fly through the air..
police say the two boys were on the same bike and neither was
wearing a helmet. 
<HR>

<H3>Bosnian Return </H3>

<P>
The suffering of the children... that's what a group of Canadians
can't forget after visiting Bosnia ... when the bombs stopped
and the air cleared in Bosnia, thousands of orphaned and hungry
children were left wandering the streets. 
<P>
A Canadian funded orphanage recently opened in Bosnia. But the
St. Catharines based Bosnian Children Relief says so much more
needs to be done. 
<P>
Anyone wishing to help the children can send donations to Bosnian
Children Relief, 77 Pelham road, St. Catharines Ontario. L2S 1S3
.
<HR>

<H3>Bangladesh </H3>

<P>
Medical teams and soldiers have been sent in to care for thousands
of people injured in one of the deadliest tornadoes ever in Bangladesh.
They'll also search for hundreds of people who are still missing.

<P>
The death toll is around 500, although another 500 remain unaccounted
for in the wake of Monday's tornado. About 50-thousand people
were hurt as the system swept through 80 villages in the country's
northern plains. 
<HR>

<H3>Valuejet Update </H3>

<P>
There's new information on a possible cause of Saturday's crash
of a Valuejet DC9 in the Florida everglades that killed 109 people.

<P>
Investigators say plane suddenly lost power and plunged to earth
-- possibly due to an explosion in the cargo hold. Data from the
flight recorder is being analyzed by the US national transportation
safety board. 
<HR>

<H3>Valuejet Suits </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, the first lawsuits have been filed in the wake of the
crash. the suits blame Valuejet and a Miami maintenance company
for alleged negligence. 
<P>
And one of Valuejet's DC9's returned to the Atlanta airport today
after controllers spotted a vapor coming from the jet. Officials
say nothing was wrong with the plane. But passengers were shaken
in light of Saturday's crash. 
<HR>

<H3>Whitby Crash </H3>

<P>
A 75-year-old Guelph man has died in an accident on the 401 Highway
in Whitby. 
<P>
Provincial police say the man was killed instantly when the motorhome
he was driving rear-ended a tractor trailer that had slowed because
of traffic. A passenger in the motorhome was treated for minor
injuries and released. The truck driver was not hurt. 
<HR>

<H3>Flying Cab </H3>

<P>
A police chase ended in a spectacular accident early today in
Toronto. 
<P>
Police say a taxi cab was stolen in the Queen and Ossington area
and was taken north. The driver lost control of the vehicle hitting
two parked cars. The cab flew through the air and bounced off
a third car before smashing into a tree. 
<P>
A man and woman in the taxi were injured. A 13-year-old girl in
the back seat was shaken up. 
<HR>

<H3>KKK </H3>

<P>
A man who had &quot;white supremacists rule&quot; and &quot;KKK&quot;
painted on a door on his front lawn faces weapons charges in Toronto.

<P>
Emergency task force officers raided the North York home last
night after a neighbor who complained about the racist slogans,
had a machine gun pointed at him. Police seized a machine gun,
two rifles, two handguns and a shotgun from the home. 
<P>

<H3>Car Hirings</H3>

<P>
A positive spin on things from the president of Ford Canada ...Mark
Hutchins says in spite of soft sales, the future is bright for
jobs in the automotive industry. 
<P>
Hutchins says industry-wide, 250-to-300 thousand people will be
hired in the next seven years or so. And he says in spite of a
major restructuring, hundreds of thousands of new recruits will
be needed to replace retiring autoworkers. 
<P>
Hutchins adds they will be looking for a new generation of skilled
autoworkers who can read, write and understand computers. 
<HR>

<H3>Census Mail </H3>

<P>
Did you forget to put your census form in the mail? Well, Census
staff say it's not too late.

will be done for the rest of the month to ensure that all questionnaires
are returned.

<H3>OMA Newser </H3>

<P>
The future of your health care system in Ontario is not very bright.
That according to the Ontario Medical Association, who today launched
a public awareness campaign, warning taxpayers that continued
funding cuts to healthcare will create a critical situation for
patients by the turn of the century... Jamie West reports....

<P>
<I>Simultaneous news conferences were held across the province
by the Ontario Medical Association, their concern is that quality
patient care has continued to erode over the last decade, along
with healthcare funding. </I>
<P>
<I>Waiting lists of between 6 months and two years exist for orthopedic,
cardiac and cataract surgery. And the government continues to
demand more service for less money. </I>
<P>
<I>Doctors say funding shortfalls have forced them to become back
room dealers, begging and borrowing support services for their
patients that need them most ...while patients themselves overuse
a system that they've never had to pay for out of pocket ... the
annual health budget for Ontario is 3.8 billion dollars. </I>
<P>
<I>The OMA says that last year doctors had their wages clawed
back by 800 million dollars because of an overrun on service provided.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Palladini Pothole </H3>

<P>
Traffic slowed to a crawl on Highway 400 north of Toronto this
morning as transportation minister Al Palladini helped road crews
fill potholes. 
<P>
Palladini denies the shovel slinging was a publicity stunt, saying
the road-work has to be done. 
<P>
About 140-million dollars for road maintenance was included in
last week's provincial budget. But at least one trucker was not
impressed with the delay and gave Palladini an unfriendly salute.

<HR>

<H3>UI Vote </H3>

<P>
Thousands of unemployed Canadians will soon notice some changes
in unemployment insurance. 
<P>
The controversial UI reforms passed third and final reading in
the house of commons today are scheduled to go into effect July
first. 
<P>
The liberal bill aims to cut two-billion dollars from the unemployment
insurance system, and get people away from the idea that it's
an income supplement program. In fact, the legislation will even
change the program's name, to Employment Insurance. 
<P>
The bill has been a controversial one since its inception... even
some liberal MP's have voiced their opposition. 
<HR>

<H3>Charest Niagara </H3>

<P>
Federal Progressive Conservative party leader Jean Charest is
in Niagara today on a campaign to rebuild his party. 
<P>
The conservatives were nearly wiped out in the last election.
And while Charest wants to talk about the economy, the constitutional
showdown between Ottawa and Quebec is putting national unity back
on the agenda. 
<HR>

<H3>Kevorkian Verdict </H3>

<P>
Doctor Jack Kevorkian has been legally vindicated for a third
time. This afternoon, a Michigan jury acquitted the retired pathologist
of two counts of assisted suicide, on their third day of deliberations.

<P>
Kevorkian had attended the suicide of two seriously-ill, but possibly
not terminally ill, women, in 1991. He said the judicial system
has been trying to &quot;lynch&quot; him.. and called on the medical
profession to set-up guidelines for physician assisted suicide.

<HR>

<H3>School Bus Hijacking </H3>

<P>
In Salt Lake City, a school bus hijacking came to a sad end today,
with the death of the 15-year-old hijacker. 
<P>
Police say the young boy shot and wounded the bus driver, then
took the wheel and drove off, leading authorities on a high speed
chase. Authorities say the boy apparently died when he crashed
the bus into a house. 
<P>
They say the bus may have been moving at more than 50-miles per
hour on impact. No other students were on the bus during the chase
and subsequent crash. 
<HR>

<H3>Value Jet Tues. </H3>

<P>
Search crews continue to comb through the swamps of the Florida
everglades at the crash site of Value-jet flight 592. 
<P>
Remains of the 109 victims of Saturday's crash, continue to be
recovered... but officials have given up hope they'll find any
bodies intact. That will make identifying them difficult. 
<P>
About 30 divers, working in 15-to-20 minute shifts, are focusing
their efforts on finding the cockpit voice recorder.. the second
of the plane's so-called &quot;black boxes&quot;. 
<P>
Officials believe the flight data recorder that was retrieved
yesterday, will be useful in the investigation.
<HR>

<H3>Simpson Tues. </H3>

<P>
OJ Simpson takes his British road show to prestigious Oxford University
today, where he goes before a thousand members of the oxford debating
club to tell his story.

<H3>Riot Inquiry </H3>

<P>
The head of the inquiry into the March riot at Queen's Park says
he's not out to lay blame. Retired judge Willard Estey opened
the probe today into the ugly picket line confrontation during
the public service strike. 
<P>
Surprisingly, organized labour, which pressured for the inquiry,
didn't send a lawyer to the probe. 
<HR>

<H3>Unity </H3>

<P>
Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard has ruled out a snap election and
a possible referendum. But he says he will not be meeting, as
scheduled, with prime minister Chretien this week. 
<P>
Bouchard is incensed after Ottawa announced Friday it intends
to join a court challenge on the legality of separation. Treasury
board president Marcel Masse says the government will argue the
constitution should supersede any referendum on Quebec sovereignty.

<HR>

<H3>Ham. East Enumeration </H3>

<P>
Enumerators from Elections Canada are pounding the pavement in
Hamilton east... knocking on doors gathering information for the
voters' list for the June 17th federal by- election. 
<P>
Janice Turner and Chris Guitard are responsible for a three square
block area. They say that some people have them confused with
census takers. Enumerators will call at each house three times
if necessary. If there's still no one home... they'll leave a
voter registration card in the mailbox.
<HR>

<H3>Chemical Fire </H3>

<P>
Hundreds of people were forced to the chilly streets of downtown
Toronto this morning by chemical fumes. Firefighters were called
to 380 Adelaide Street West, near Spadina after two chemicals
mixed together caused an unexpected reaction. 
<P>
District fire chief Robert Richardson says officials are still
trying to determine what compound was produced by the mixture,
which filled the air with fumes. There were no injuries. 
<HR>

<H3>Plane Follow </H3>

<P>
Officials have confirmed that human remains have been recovered
from the site of the crash of flight 592, and that a full recovery
may take weeks. The very difficult search for bodies and wreckage
goes on in the Florida everglades.
<HR>

<H3>Simpson England </H3>

<P>
OJ. Simpson continued his blitz in Britain today, with an appearance
on a prime time talk show hosted by a husband and wife team. He
was asked some of the same questions Americans continued to ask
about the murders he was acquitted of. 
<HR>

<H3>Jackie O Auction </H3>

<P>
Call it a case of buyer's remorse.. after last month's high-priced
auction of items from the estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

<P>
Newsweek reports Sotheby's Auction House let two or three buyers,
who were swept away in the bidding, return their items to be &quot;reoffered&quot;.

<P>
There won't be another auction.. the items have already been resold.
There's no word on which items were returned.

<H3>Herbal Ecstasy </H3>

<P>
A warning tonight about a new fad that could have fatal consequences.
Police and health authorities say a product called herbal ecstasy,
available in stores throughout the region, is gaining wider use,
and could lead to tragedy. Jamie West reports. 
<P>
<I>Love and light, warmth and spiritual awareness...the promises
of a 100 percent natural, 100 percent legal and 100 percent potentially
fatal drug called herbal ecstasy. It's widely available among
dance club goers and ravers. </I>
<P>
<I>In the US the drug has been tied to as many as 15 deaths, young
people taking too much and in some cases mixing it with alcohol.
It's main ingredient ephedra, derived from the Chinese ma huang
herb. </I>
<P>
<I>Jay Dilio runs Spiritual Smoke a downtown Hamilton paraphernalia
shop. He brings herbal e in from the US through a Kitchener based
distributor</I>
<P>
<I>Double the recommended dose of four pills- exactly what killed
a US teenager while vacationing in Florida. Not true according
to this undercover vice and drug officer. </I>
<P>
<I>The US based manufacturer of herbal ecstasy, Global World Media
Corporation last year sold 300 million dollars worth of the product.
On the street it sells for a dime to a dollar a pill. </I>
<P>
<I>Despite warnings right on the package the US Food and Drug
Administration is now issuing it's own warning against using ephedra
products like herbal e. But Global World Media Corp. is already
one step ahead...and herbal ecstasy two is now on the market stateside
and heading for Canada...it's ephedra free ...but contains derivatives
from the Kava Kava plant...a plant with narcotic properties.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Blood Warning </H3>

<P>
Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children has sent out 525 letters
to parents whose children received blood products last year that
may be infected with a potentially deadly virus. 
<P>
The Canadian Red Cross says some lots of blood products were prepared
from blood donated by people who developed croytz-feld yah-kob
disease. The disease is a degenerative brain illness. Symptoms
can take up to 30 years to develop. 
<HR>

<H3>Alzheimer Water </H3>

<P>
Researchers are calling it the strongest evidence to date, that
high levels of aluminum in drinking water can cause Alzheimer's
disease. 
<P>
A University of Toronto study found that Ontario residents with
Alzheimer's are 1 to 2 times as likely to have lived in areas
where the drinking water contained more than 100 micrograms per
litre, of aluminum. That level is exceeded by many municipal water
plants, including two of the four plants in the Toronto area.

<P>
Aluminum is used by treatment plants across Canada to remove solid
wastes from drinking water. 
<HR>

<H3>Human Rights Newser </H3>

<P>
All eyes in the gay community across Canada will be on parliament
hill next week, for the free vote on the government's gay rights
bill. Although there seems to be enough support to pass the bill,
one lobby group isn't taking any chances. 
<P>
Meanwhile, 30 people protested in Parry Sound today, against Ottawa's
gay rights bill. Their anger was directed at the area's Liberal
MP who is in favor of the bill. The protesters say Andy Mitchell
doesn't represent the views of his rural constituents. 
<HR>

<H3>Gas Prices </H3>

<P>
We are being hosed, at the gas pumps. So say federal NDP members,
who will promote a gas boycott by consumers, beginning Monday.
It's true that prices are rising at the pumps, but as Scot Urquhart
reports ... major oil companies may not be entirely to blame:

<P>
<I>It's almost guaranteed to make Canadians grumble ... gas prices
climbing from the high fifties ... to 60 cents a litre and more.
How do consumers feel about it?</I>
<P>
<I>Richard O'Farrell of Imperial Oil says Americans are going
through gas, like water ... sucking the tanks dry across the continent,
and driving prices up. In addition, some major refineries had
to shut down for unscheduled maintenance... that during a harsh
winter, in which refiners used crude oil to make heating oil rather
than gas ... hence, a shortfall in the spring. Adding to the demand,
a rising number of gas-guzzling vehicles on the road, and higher
speed limits, across north America. </I>
<P>
<I>But if you still get the feeling that you're being gouged ...
the CAA says ... perhaps you should look at the government, instead
of the gas companies: and Dave Connolly says, prices may go even
higher, this summer: </I>
<P>
<I>So we asked the professionals how to save money on gas... you
can also use the self serve pump ... pay attention to what you're
pumping.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Twain </H3>

<P>
Country singer Shania Twain will return to her northern Ontario
roots on August 15th for a &quot;special day of recognition&quot;.
The mayor of Timmins, Vic Powers, says city council will honor
her by declaring the highway which runs through the city Shania
Twain Way.

<H3>Budget Cuts </H3>

<P>
Registered nurses in Ontario say someone could die because of
spending cuts in health care. A survey by the Ontario Nurses Association
found most nurses feel low staffing levels have created unsafe
conditions for patients. 
<HR>

<H3>Gays Legislation</H3>

<P>
The government's gay rights bill will be law within days and some
Liberal MP's don't like it. 
<P>
23 liberals voted against the legislation , now some say the government
is cutting off debate and ramming the bill through parliament.

<HR>

<H3>Halton Rape </H3>

<P>
Halton Region Police have released details of another sexual assault
in Burlington, but said they don't believe it was committed by
the serial rapist being sought for brutal attacks on three youngsters.

<P>
A 14-year-old girl was sexually assaulted April 24th, as she walked
home from a baby-sitting job. She was approached by a man and
forced into a secluded driveway, where she was assaulted. But
the suspect's description does not match that of a man who raped
three youngsters, in Kitchener, Brampton and Oakville over the
past four years. 
<HR>

<H3>Toronto Homicide </H3>

<P>
A 43-year-old man faces a charge of second-degree murder in connection
with the slaying of his 23 year old stepdaughter in Toronto. 
<P>
Officers were called to the victim's basement apartment yesterday
afternoon. They found a man, as well as the body of the woman.
The man was taken to hospital, suffering from self-inflicted knife
wounds to his wrists, neck and arms. It's Toronto's 17th homicide
of the year. 
<HR>

<H3>Dying Mom Cancer </H3>

<P>
Donna Mercier was remanded to June 13th when she appeared in a
Toronto court today on a public mischief charge. 
<P>
She's the woman who told police she was dying of cancer and had
been robbed, prompting an outpouring of public donations. Her
lawyer won't say how she will plead. But he says the matter is
wearing her down. 
<HR>

<H3>Runaway Bus</H3>

<P>
It's probably the nightmare of every parent... sending a child
to school on a bus. This past Monday in Knox Indiana, a school
bus driver taking children home, had a seizure.. and lost control
of his bus as it began heading toward a river and a decrepit old
bridge. 
<P>
Surveillance tape shot inside the bus, shows how the children
were thrown around when the driver passed out. Both police and
local school officials are crediting 17-year old John Waldren
with saving the children. Waldren was able to pull the emergency
break and stop the vehicle just as it reached the bridge. 
<HR>

<H3>Melanoma Awareness </H3>

<P>
Melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer and the number of people
getting it is increasing. But a new survey shows about half of
the men and a third of the women questioned, didn't recognize
the term.

<HR>

<H3>Copps Quits </H3>

<P>
The election race is on, in Hamilton east. Sheila Copps made it
official today: she resigned. The deputy prime minister was emotional
as she confronted the unspoken rule... that politicians, are only
as good as their word. Scot Urquhart reports: 
<P>
<I>It was the toughest decision of her career ... but Sheila Copps
says, she had to listen to the voice within.</I>
<P>
<I>Copps admitted, that despite public posturing to the contrary;
she struggled with her promise to resign; over the GST.  And although
there are signs that liberal strategist Milt Lewis may be right:
he concedes that the issue of the GST could be a campaign millstone.</I>
<P>
<I>There is really only one place to take the true political pulse
of Hamilton ... and the reaction from the donut shop, was mixed.
And that face in the crowd admits, she's learned a hard lesson,
about politics.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Harris - Copps </H3>

<P>
Ontario premier Mike Harris says Sheila Copps has done Canadian
politicians a favor. Harris says politicians who make campaign
commitments should &quot;resign or go back to the people&quot;
if they break their word after being elected. He says by resigning,
Copps has restored some integrity to the political process. 
<HR>

<H3>5.5 GST </H3>

<P>
And still more fall-out from the much hated goods and services
tax. Today an angry Ontario premier, Mike Harris accused the federal
government of bribery in compensating Newfoundland for merging
its sales tax with the GST. Harris says the GST should be uniform
across Canada. 
<HR>

<H3>Gays Apology</H3>

<P>
Reform MP Bob Ringma has apologized for comments he made about
homosexuals. Ringma said he would dismiss or &quot;move to the
back of the shop&quot; a gay or lesbian who might be offending
customers. But after coming under heavy fire, Ringma apologized,
saying he fully believes in equality for all. He then stepped
down as Reform party whip. 
<HR>

<H3>Dying Mom-Cancer </H3>

<P>
The young son of a woman who told police she was dying and had
been robbed of all her money, will receive a share of the money
donated by the public. 
<P>
Police and CIBC officials decided to conduct a poll to decide
what to do with the money. 10 percent of the 94 thousand dollars,
still in the fund, will be given to the woman's son. The remainder
will be distributed to programs for children and abused women,
kidney research and food banks, but the bulk will go to cancer
research. 
<HR>

<H3>Van Gogh </H3>

<P>
Money never seems to be scarce when it comes to the artworld.

<P>
A rare Vincent van Gogh cafe scene, led sales of impressionist
and modern paintings at Christie's Auction House last night. It
was the first major art auction of the spring season. Van Gogh's
&quot;Interieur d'un Restaurant&quot; sold for 10.3 million dollars.

<H3>NDP-Tax Cut </H3>

<P>
More than 100 thousand Ontario residents contacted by the NDP,
have returned postcards, criticizing the government's planned
tax cut. And according to party spokesmen, it's the biggest response
to a mailing the Ontario NDP has ever received and proves there
are serious reservations about the tax reduction. 
<HR>

<H3>Harris-Polls </H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris maintains that his government's policies are
not anti women, even though two recent public opinion polls show
that the majority of women do not support the Harris government.
The premier blames the bad image on others and says his government
will have to do a better job of communicating its policies. 
<HR>

<H3>Gays - Ringma</H3>

<P>
Reform MP Bob Ringma's remark that he would fire &quot;or move
to the back of the shop&quot; a homosexual or member of an ethnic
minority, is being criticized. But there are indications Reformers
support him. 
<P>
Ringma told the Vancouver Sun if he were a businessman, he would
get rid of gay or black employees whose presence turned off bigoted
customers. Gay rights activist John Fisher is appalled. But other
Reform MP's defended Ringma's stance. 
<HR>

<H3>Tasmania Massacre</H3>

<P>
Australian authorities clamped tight security around the man charged
in connection with the massacre of 35 people, and warned an angry,
grieving community not to seek vengeance. 
<P>
Australian Martin Bryant, described as a wealthy and eccentric
loner, was charged at his hospital bedside with one count of murder.
But more charges will follow. 
<HR>

<H3>North Ireland </H3>

<P>
Canada's former top soldier may be called back into duty in the
northern Ireland peace process. The Irish government has suggested
retired General John de Chastelain be asked to chair decommissioning
talks to run parallel to all-party peace talks that are to start
June 10th. 
<P>
Ireland's deputy prime minister raised the prospect in a speech
to British and Irish parliamentarians last night. 
<HR>

<H3>Coma Rape </H3>

<P>
A baby born to a woman in a coma-like state is home with his grandmother.
The family's lawyer says the family plans to formalize details
of guardianship. 
<P>
The woman was raped while in a Rochester, New York, nursing home.
She gave birth last month. 
<HR>

<H3>Obesity Seiden </H3>

<P>
Americans fighting obesity have some new ammunition. Yesterday
the food and drug administration approved the first new anti-obesity
drug in 20 years. It alters the a brain chemical to make people
feel full. 
<P>
But critics say the drug can cause brain damage or a rare lung
disorder. The FDA concluded those risks were remote. But some
doctors have other concerns. 
<P>
The drug is scheduled to go on sale this summer. 
<HR>

<H3>Spring? </H3>

<P>
Death threats against Wiarton Willie ... weathermen in hiding
... snow in Timmins ... overcoats in April. There is only one
question on the minds of Ontario residents these days .... where
is spring? 
<P>

<HR>

<H3>Dueling Polls </H3>

<P>
Two new public opinion polls have been released... and they give
a conflicting picture of the support the Harris government is
getting from Ontarians. 
<P>
One poll has the Tories in the lead, while the other puts the
liberals out in front.
<HR>

<H3>Eves-Budget Date </H3>

<P>
The provincial budget will come down Tuesday May 7th. Finance
minister Ernie Eves made the announcement today in the legislature.

<P>
It's expected to contain a 14 percent provincial &quot;income
tax&quot; cut for Ontarians. Eves says he is determined to go
ahead with the tax cut, even though a survey shows most Ontarians
will save it not spend it. 
<HR>

<H3>School Councils </H3>

<P>
Are you fed up with the education your child is getting at school?
If you are, you're not alone. 
<P>
Thousands of parents across the province are demanding a chance
to have a greater say in what happens in the classroom... and
this summer, they'll get it. The Ministry of Education will institute
school councils, to begin work this fall. Scot Urquhart has more:

<P>
<I>We all talk about it ... but sometimes it seems that no one
does anything about it... education in Ontario has become a puzzle
where the pieces are increasingly hard to fit.</I>
<P>
<I>Marlene Gibson is a parent.... and she is not only for supporting
her local school, but getting other parents involved as well.
And that's where school councils come in. The province has decreed,
that every school shall have one by the end of June; comprised
of parents, that will advise and direct the local board of education
on how to implement provincial policies in neighbourhood schools.
But isn't that what publicly elected school trustees are for?</I>
<P>
<I>The new councils will piggy-back on the services of existing
parent groups, rather than replace them. Nominations for council
members close in public schools May 10th; elections will be held
in every school on the 23rd. Anyone interested in serving on a
school council, should contact their neighbourhood school principal.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Cop Shot </H3>

<P>
A mortally wounded Montreal police officer lay on the ground in
a pool of blood for about 15 minutes, before a passer-by attempted
first-aid and then used the police radio to call for help. 
<P>
Andr&eacute; Lalonde, who was two months away from retirement,
was shot when he stopped a vehicle because of a noisy muffler.
He died in hospital about two hours after the shooting. Officers
later found the suspect car. 
<P>
The slain officer was 51 years old and the father of two adult
children. 
<HR>

<H3>Tasmania Shooting </H3>

<P>
Australian police have identified the man they are holding in
the massacre of at least 34 people in Tasmania. 
<P>
Police sources say he's 28 year old Martin Bryant -- a man with
a history of psychological problems. Two of the 19 people wounded
are Canadians. 
<HR>

<H3>Colby </H3>

<P>
The former head of the CIA, William Colby, has been reported missing
from his vacation home in Maryland. 
<P>
Coast Guard divers and helicopters are searching for Colby who
has been missing since Saturday night. His canoe was found last
night .. about a quarter-mile from his home. 
<HR>

<H3>Reeve/Kidder </H3>

<P>
Actor Christopher Reeve has offered his &quot;Superman&quot; co-star,
Margot Kidder, a job. The New York Post says Reeve called Kidder
last week, to wish her well after hearing how she had suffered
a breakdown in Los Angeles. 
<P>
Reeve, who was paralyzed in a riding accident last year, said
if his health permits, he'd like the Canadian-born actress to
join him in a production of the two-character play &quot;Love
Letters.&quot; 
<HR>

<H3>Rent Opens </H3>

<P>
Much excitement in New York tonight....&quot;Rent&quot; opens
on Broadway. The modest musical was quietly launched off-Broadway
in February, and created a sensation. It became the show to see.
Critics were unanimous in their praise ....the public responded
enthusiastically. &quot;Rent&quot; became an immediate hit. 
<P>
Labeled as the breakthrough musical of the 90's, the rock musical
is generating the kind of excitement &quot;Hair&quot; and &quot;A
Chorus Line&quot; did in their time. Inspired by Puccini's &quot;La
Boheme,&quot; &quot;Rent&quot; is a joyous and turbulent musical
that celebrates a community of young east villagers as they struggle
with the soaring hopes and tough realities of today's New York.

<P>
Even before its Broadway opening tonight, &quot;Rent&quot; was
awarded the ultimate accolade ....winning the 1996 Pulitzer Prize
for drama. 
<P>
Unfortunately, Jonathan Larson, the show's 35-year-old composer,
lyricist and librettist was never aware of the show's impact.
He died of an aortic aneurysm following the final dress rehearsal.

<P>
Entertainment reporter Alex Reynolds says we'll see the show in
Toronto this fall. David and Ed Mirvish today announced they have
secured the Canadian rights to the musical. 
<P>
The show, which Larson seven years to create, has become his legacy.

<H3>Nurses/Doctors - Cuts </H3>

<P>
Ontario's nurses are being asked to take big pay cuts... while
doctors are pushing for their OHIP billing cap to be lifted. 
<P>
It is the latest episode in the health care funding battle...
a battle that began with Medicare more than 25 years ago. Anthony
Pooley has the details. 
<P>
<I>More than 17 billion dollars of taxpayers money is spent each
year on providing health care for Ontarians... and the way in
which that money ought to be spent has always sparked loud and
sometimes acrimonious debate both within and against the health
care community... perennially versus government. </I>
<P>
<I>Several years ago, an OHIP billing cap was imposed on doctors
by the NDP administration... and this year, billings exceed the
cap by a half billion dollars. The physicians want it... and Premier
Mike Harris says they can't have it. </I>
<P>
<I>While all of this is going on ... those who deliver by far
the lion's share of medical care in hospitals... nurses... are
being asked to take a pay cut... a cut that would amount to more
than 20 percent over three years ... a cut that would mean nurses
would earn pennies an hour more than cafeteria workers. </I>
<P>
<I>As ONA regional representative Ancilla Ho-young puts it...
you get what you pay for. </I>
<P>
<I>So the stage is set for another episode in the never-ending
soap opera... nurses versus doctors versus the Ontario government
and the Ontario Hospital Association. It is a fight about money,
to be sure, but it is also a fight about the quality and indeed
the future of Ontario's beleaguered health care system, with those
doctors and nurses alike digging in for a fight. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Ont. Survivalists</H3>

<P>
The Ontario Provincial Police report that two para-military groups
recently formed in the province, are under surveillance. 
<P>
A number of ultra right wing, para military militias, operating
in the united states are fueled by anti government sentiment.
The OPP won't say where the Ontario groups, called &quot;survivalists&quot;
are operating. 
<P>
Solicitor General Bob Runciman says there is some cause for concern.

<HR>

<H3>Somalia Documents </H3>

<P>
More revelations about a military cover-up in the Somalia affair.
A memo to Canada's top soldier appears to contradict what general
Jean Boyle told military police about altered documents released
to the media. 
<HR>

<H3>Gorby Kill </H3>

<P>
Former soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was attacked while campaigning
in Russia's presidential election today. His aides called it an
assassination attempt but one report says he was simply punched
in the face by a drunken man. 
<P>
The 65-year-old Gorbachev was attacked while on his way to address
a largely hostile meeting in the western Siberian city of Omsk.
He was not hurt. the assailant was arrested. 
<HR>

<H3>Subway Trial </H3>

<P>
The man accused of masterminding what Japan calls it's &quot;crime
of the century&quot;.... went on trial today. Shoko Asahara is
accused of murder in last years nerve gas attack on subway trains
in Tokyo. 
<HR>

<H3>Margot Kidder </H3>

<P>
Police say Canadian actress Margot Kidder was &quot;frightened
for her life&quot; when she disappeared. She was found yesterday,
dazed and disoriented, in a Glendale, California, backyard. 
<P>
Investigators say there's no evidence kidder was the victim of
foul play. She's in hospital undergoing a psychiatric assessment.

<HR>

<H3>Jackie O Auction </H3>

<P>
An incredible auction continues today in New York. Items from
the estate of the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis are on sale
at Sotheby's auction house.

<H3>GST Merger </H3>

<P>
Ontario premier Mike Harris says he rejects the idea of federal
dollars being used to pay for sales tax harmonization in Atlantic
Canada. 
<P>
The plan calls for the merger of the federal provincial sales
tax systems in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland into
one national tax. The rate will be 15 percent in the three provinces,
down from current combined rates. 
<P>
As part of the plan, the federal government will pay the three
Atlantic provinces 961 million dollars over four years to make
up for losses of provincial revenue. Harris suggests that amounts
to bribing the three provinces with tax money from other provinces,
and he says &quot;that's wrong&quot;. 
<P>
The new tax takes effect April first 1997. All services covered
by the GST before the changes will be subject to the new tax.

<HR>

<H3>Tsubouchi </H3>

<P>
It has yet to result in a single fraud conviction. But social
services minister David Tsubouchi says Ontario's welfare snitch-
-line will soon pay off. 
<P>
The telephone hotline has taken 15-thousand calls since it opened
last October. Tsubouchi says suspected fraud cases must be investigated
and processed through the courts -- all of which takes time. 
<P>
The snitch line has cost 170-thousand dollars so far, but Tsubouchi
estimates it will eventually save taxpayers about 25-million dollars
a year. 
<HR>

<H3>Principals Cuts </H3>

<P>
A group of high school principals from across Ontario, are warning
parents that the Harris governments plans to reform the education
system, could cause real damage to Ontario students. 
<P>
The principals want the government to slow down and engage in
more consultation. 
<HR>

<H3>Prince</H3>

<P>
Prince Charles is visiting Canada for the first time in five years.
He arrived in Ottawa today aboard a Canadian forces jet. 
<P>
The last time he visited Canada he was accompanied by his two
sons and the Princess of Wales. 
<P>
His royal highness will visit Hamilton Friday, to attend the official
opening of the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum of which he is
the patron. 
<HR>

<H3>The Monarchy </H3>

<P>
And while the Prince enjoys his week long visit to Canada, the
Ontario wing of the Federal Liberal party will be asked this weekend
to vote on a policy that would abolish the British monarch as
Canada's head of state. 
<P>
The vote will be held at the wing's annual general meeting in
Windsor beginning Friday. Similar debate over the future of the
monarchy is taking place on both sides of the Atlantic.
<HR>

<H3>Chernobyl </H3>

<P>
Firefighters say they've doused a large fire near the Chernobyl
nuclear plant in Ukraine. Officials disagree over how much radioactive
dust the fire might have sent into the air. 
<P>
The world's worst commercial nuclear disaster occurred at the
Chernobyl plant ten years ago this week. 
<HR>

<H3>Dudayev Dead? </H3>

<P>
It's unclear whether Chechen rebel leader zhoh-car Dudayev is
alive or dead. The itar-tass news agency says Dudayev was killed
in a missile attack this week in Chechnya. But the independent
Interfax news agency said that report is untrue. 
<P>
Interfax quotes an aide to Dudayev as saying the Chechen leader
is alive and working as usual.

<H3>Nunziata Dumped </H3>

<P>
The Liberals have booted one Toronto MP out of caucus and a second
has quit. 
<P>
John Nunziata ran afoul of party brass by voting against the budget,
in effect, casting a vote of non-confidence in the government.
Liberal whip Don Boudria says governments stand or fall on whether
they have the confidence of the commons on budgetary matters.
And that by voting against the budget, Nunziata has shown he no
longer supports his government. 
<P>
An aide says Nunziata will take a few days to consider his political
future, but he is expected to sit as an independent in the house
of commons. His colleague, Dennis Mills, says he will join Nunziata
in sitting with the independents. 
<HR>

<H3>Gray Cancer </H3>

<P>
Solicitor General Herb Gray has been diagnosed with throat cancer.
A statement from his office says the 64 year old veteran Ontario
MP had tests at an Ottawa hospital that turned up small cell carcinoma
of the esophagus. 
<P>
While he's undergoing treatment, he'll be cutting back on his
activities as solicitor general, government house leader, and
liberal MP for Windsor west. 
<HR>

<H3>Snobelen </H3>

<P>
Education Minister John Snobelen says the Tory caucus is &quot;solidly
behind&quot; his efforts to reform the province's education system.
That's despite criticism from two backbenchers. 
<P>
Tory MPP Bill Murdoch told a radio station, that Snobelen &quot;doesn't
know what he's doing.&quot; And under pressure from students,
Quinte MPP Doug Rollins acknowledged the government lied when
it said the cuts wouldn't hurt the classroom. 
<HR>

<H3>Workfare Plan </H3>

<P>
One of premier Mike Harris's election promises was to devise a
system that would force welfare recipients to work for their money.
And while the Tories continue to iron out the wrinkles, a group
of welfare recipients in the Peterborough area, have taken the
bull by the horns and devised their own Workfare program... a
program they claim does work. 
<HR>

<H3>Pickering Nuclear </H3>

<P>
Energy Minister Brenda Elliott says the Bruce and Darlington nuclear
plants are not affected by a shutdown of reactors at the Pickering
Power Station. 
<P>
Ontario Hydro says the operating systems at those plants are different
than the one that caused problems last week at Pickering. Hydro
shut down all eight reactors at Pickering after detecting a flaw
in a secondary safety system. 
<P>
Greenpeace says the shutdown was intentionally delayed to avoid
embarrassing the Prime Minister who has been in Romania promoting
Candu technology.
<HR>

<H3>Motts-Grape Growers </H3>

<P>
And then, ... there were none. Ontario's one and only grape juice
processing plant, is closing down. That will not only put nearly
200 people in St. Catharines out of work but as Scot Urquhart
reports, it's going to put a big squeeze on the Ontario grape
industry, as well: 
<P>
<I>It was only one contract .. but it was a big one ... for Cadbury
Beverages in St. Catharines.  There is no indication why the Ocean
Spray contract was lost ... but it means that 170 workers at this
plant will be out of a job, at the end of the year. </I>
<P>
<I>They are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers
.... our calls to the union, were not returned. But plant employees,
are not the only ones affected ... this plant is the only grape
juice processing plant, in Ontario. Fully one third of all grapes
grown in Niagara ... were handled here. That means a big hit ...
for grape growers, too.</I>
<P>
<I>But even though the closure may force some of his growers into
bankruptcy; John Neufeld recognizes that the Cadbury decision,
was strictly business: and not all grape growers, were devastated
by the news: so much so, that Tom Greensides isn't going to cut
back on his juice grapes ... he's going to put more in.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Homolka Parole </H3>

<P>
Corrections Canada says a leaked letter written to convicted killer
Karla Homolka may have breached prison security. 
<P>
Spokesman Ron Fairley says if the letter was taken from Homolka's
cell, the warden will investigate the theft. The letter, written
by Homolka's sister Lori, indicates Karla may apply for an escorted
temporary absence pass from the Kingston prison for women. 
<P>
Lori suggests that Karla should dye her hair and return to St.
Catharines. She says people are stupid and even if they bumped
into her, no one would know who she was. 
<HR>

<H3>Pavarotti-Toronto </H3>

<P>
The opera super singers are coming to Canada. It was announced
today the three tenors will perform in Toronto next year ....their
only north American appearance.
<P>
Tickets, ranging in price from 25 to four hundred and 50 dollars,
go on sale in May. Alex Reynolds reports. 
<P>
<I>Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras will appear
January 4th, 1997, at the SkyDome. </I>
<P>
<I>The rotund tenor made a whirlwind 40 minute stop at Pearson
airport to launch the venture. He says television and large stadiums
are reaching the masses. </I>
<P>
<I>These massive concerts are winning fans for opera. I asked
the maestro about the next generation of tenors, particularly
the spectacular Roberto Alagna. </I>
<P>
<I>Sports impresario Peter Pocklington is co-producing the SkyDome
sing-in. So the three tenors juggernaut continues ....Pavarotti,
Domingo and Carreras bring their singing act to Toronto...in what
should be the biggest concert this country has ever seen.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Bombeck Obit </H3>

<P>
Housewife turned columnist Erma Bombeck has died. The woman who
poked gentle fun at life in the suburbs passed away today at a
San Francisco hospital. 
<P>
Bombeck had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992 and underwent
a mastectomy. Shortly afterwards she received a kidney transplant
after her kidneys began to fail. Erma Bombeck was 69.

<H3>KW Protest </H3>

<P>
It was a great day for a protest. Rainy skies cleared up in time
for a giant noon hour rally in Kitchener, the third community
action day in Ontario. 
<P>
Although this latest protest wasn't as large as previous ones
in London and Hamilton, what it lacked in numbers, it made up
for in spirit. 
<HR>

<H3>Mulroney </H3>

<P>
Brian Mulroney has wrapped up his pre-trial statements in his
50 million dollar libel lawsuit against Ottawa. 
<P>
The former prime minister is suing the RCMP and the Justice Department
for alleging he received kickbacks in the 1988 sale of airbus
jets to Air Canada. 
<P>
Today in Montreal, Mulroney repeated he was innocent. He also
said when he first learned of the allegations, he offered to let
police look at his financial records to prove he could not have
taken any kickbacks. But he says they wouldn't give him the time
of day. 
<HR>

<H3>Beer Pricing </H3>

<P>
This past week the provincial government changed rules which determine
how beer prices are set. The idea was to spark more competition
between brewers. But few people in the hospitality industry feel
the new rules will result in lower beer prices for consumers.

<HR>

<H3>Enviro. Reportcard </H3>

<P>
Just three days before the celebration of &quot;Earth Day&quot;,
Ontario's New Democratic Party has given the Harris government
a failing grade on environmental issues. 
<P>
The NDP's report card gives the government an &quot;F&quot; in
the protection of everything from land, air and water. But it
did receive an &quot;A&quot; in environmental rhetoric. 
<P>
The NDP accuses the government of gutting the environmental bill
of rights, lifting the ban on municipal garbage incinerators,
and contracting out, or closing up to 15 provincial parks. 
<P>
NDP environment critic, Marilyn Churley says the government's
message is &quot;full steam ahead&quot; for short-term profit.
But Churley adds, protection of the environment is still high
on the public's agenda. 
<HR>

<H3>Wolf Attack </H3>

<P>
A man and woman are in hospital at this hour after they were attacked
by a lion at the African Lion Safari near Cambridge earlier this
afternoon. 
<P>
Although few details have been released, it is known the 20 year
old woman is suffering from a head injury. She was a passenger
in a car at the safari and her window was partly rolled down.
The driver suffered an injury while trying to assist the woman.

<P>
And a 24 year old woman is dead after being attacked by wolves
at the Haliburton Wildlife Reserve late yesterday. The woman was
inside a fenced compound when the wolves attacked. Dead is Tricia
Wyman of Haliburton. 
<HR>

<H3>Israel Diplomacy </H3>

<P>
There are hopes tonight that the fighting along Israel's border
with Lebanon could soon end. Hezbollah rockets today pounded northern
Israel. Israeli artillery and gunboats also were in action. 
<P>
There are no reports of new casualties. But prospects of a cease-fire
remain alive. 
<HR>

<H3>Canuck-Egypt </H3>

<P>
A Canadian is among the 18 foreign tourists gunned down yesterday
in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. 
<P>
50 year old Nick Petrou, a London Ontario native, was on his first
pilgrimage to famous holy sites in the middle east when his bus
was attacked by Islamic fundamentalists. All of the victims were
part of a tour group composed mainly of Greeks. 
<HR>

<H3>Oklahoma Anniversary</H3>

<P>
Oklahoma City was silent today - to remember the victims of the
bombing that rocked the city a year ago. Mourners met at the bombing
site to mark the first anniversary of the tragedy that killed
168 people.

<H3>Mulroney </H3>

<P>
Brian Mulroney says an allegation that he was involved in an airbus
kickback scheme was the &quot;most devastating&quot; experience
he has ever faced. 
<P>
The former prime minister made the comment during testimony at
a pre-trial hearing in his 50 million dollar libel lawsuit against
the Justice Department and RCMP. 
<P>
Under oath, he called the allegations grotesque lies and monstrous
falsehoods. He also accused the government of fascism for not
sharing its evidence with him when he first sought it last November.

<P>
Although they felt he was sometimes out of line, government lawyers
said they had no objections to Mulroney's tirade. 
<HR>

<H3>Liquor Laws </H3>

<P>
Starting May first, bars in Ontario will be allowed to stay open
until 2 a.m. That's an hour later than current regulations permit.

<P>
Golfers will also have more opportunity for a nip on the back
nine. The sale and consumption of liquor will be allowed on golf
courses if the course already has a liquor licence and if they
apply for a licence amendment. 
<P>
The changes in drinking laws are part of a modernization movement
according to the Tory government 
<HR>

<H3>Harris-Benefits </H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris says there is nothing wrong with the Conservative
party paying his expenses. 
<P>
According to the Globe and Mail, those expenses include a golf
club membership, a tuxedo and dry cleaning bills. 
<HR>

<H3>Student Demo </H3>

<P>
The big yellow protest found its way to Queen's Park today. 300
students marched to the Ontario Legislature to deliver a huge
yellow banner. A banner with thousands of names on it ..calling
on Premier Mike Harris to reverse the cutbacks to education spending.

<P>
The Conservatives are cutting one billion dollars in funding to
schools, colleges and universities. 
<P>
In contrast to a violent demonstration by students earlier this
year....this one was peaceful. 
<HR>

<H3>Tax Reform </H3>

<P>
Two of the province's largest taxpayers organizations are calling
on the Harris government to bring in property tax reform based
on unit assessment for the whole province. 
<P>
Unit value assessment is based on physical measurement only ..such
as square footage of the buildings and the size of the lot. This
differs from market value assessment which is based on real estate
prices which vary from year to year. 
<P>
Both the Ontario Taxpayers Federation and the Confederation of
Ratepayers association say the big plus for unit assessment is
stability. 
<HR>

<H3>Lebanon Update </H3>

<P>
In world news tonight, an Israeli jet attacked villages near the
southern Lebanon port of Tyre today... this after Hezbollah guerrillas
fired three salvos of rockets onto northern Israel. 
<HR>

<H3>Quickie Divorce </H3>

<P>
A judge in London today took the first step towards granting a
divorce for Britain's Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York.

<H3>Cheese Stink </H3>

<P>
There could be more holes in this story; than you'd find in any
imported cheese. Ottawa wants to bring in tough health regulations
that might ban some types of foreign cheese from entering the
country, including parmesan cheese. 
<P>
But as Scot Urquhart reports; the proposals may have more to do
with producing healthy profits for Canadian manufacturers; than
they do with protecting the health of Canadians: 
<P>
<I>Ottawa says, this stuff could kill you ... but even health
minister Dave Dingwall admits his bureaucrats cannot site even
one specific instance ... in which someone got sick from eating
unpasturized cheese. </I>
<P>
<I>Nevertheless ... Health Canada is considering new regulations
that would take a big slice out of foreign cheese imports, by
banning cheeses made from unpasturized milk. Cheeses like French
brie; and Italian parmesan.</I>
<P>
<I>In the kitchens of La Cantina ... one of Hamilton's best Italian
restaurants ... parmesan is a staple more common than salt. Owner
Tina Grande says they could survive without Italian imports but
it wouldn't be the same.</I>
<P>
<I>And without one documented case of illness there is a question
of whether the proposed federal regulations are really designed
to protect the health of consumers or instead, to duck around
international GATT agreements by using a so-called health issue,
to put up a trade barrier against foreign imports. </I>
<P>
<I>You know, oddly enough... the new government regulations were
drafted after consultation with Agriculture Canada, the National
Dairy Council of Canada, and the Dairy Farmers of Canada. </I>
<P>
<I>Anyone other than those interested parties who may wish to
comment on the issue should contact Health Canada, before the
end of May. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Credit Cards </H3>

<P>
You probably didn't need a government report to tell you this
... but Canadians are paying too much interest on their credit
cards. 
<P>
The report blames the major banks for dragging their feet when
it comes to passing on lower rates... right now.. the cards charge
up to twelve percentage points higher than the prime.. 
<HR>

<H3>Homolka Petition </H3>

<P>
In Ottawa today a committee demanded that the federal government
hold an inquiry into Karla Homolka's plea bargain. 
<P>
Homolka got twelve years for her role in the deaths of Kristen
French and Leslie Mahaffy in exchange for her testimony at the
first degree murder trial of her ex husband Paul Bernardo. 
<P>
The committee says there is no way Homolka should get off so lightly
for her part in the girls murders. 
<HR>

<H3>Shooting Inquest </H3>

<P>
An inquest will be held into the mass murder in Vernon, BC 
<P>
BC's Attorney General says the enormity of the tragedy requires
the most thorough scrutiny possible. He says an inquest jury will
be able to examine every aspect of the killings of nine members
of the Gakhal and Saran families. They were shot on Good Friday
by Mark Chahal, the estranged husband of one of the victims, who
then took his own life. 
<P>
The RCMP is also holding an internal investigation of how the
mounties handled events that led to the shooting. 
<HR>

<H3>Brantford Diabetic </H3>

<P>
Fallout today after a man charged in a quadruple fatal car crash
back in 1994 walked away from court with his licence intact. 
<P>
The fiery accident happened near Brantford... Gordon Wood was
charged with four counts of dangerous driving causing death. Yesterday
those charges were dropped. 
<P>
The mother of one of the four people killed is outraged. Connie
Dickerson of Hamilton says Wood should not be allowed to drive.
The Canadian Diabetes Association has been drawn into the controversy
and says that Wood's medical condition is rare, and doesn't mean
diabetics in general should be taken off the road. 
<HR>

<H3>Speed Limits</H3>

<P>
It appears the drive to raise speed limits on major Ontario highways
has shifted into low gear. 
<P>
Solicitor General Bob Runciman says he's not enthusiastic about
raising the maximum limit for cars to 120-kilometres an hour.
Runciman is in charge of the OPP which polices the 400-series
highways. 
<P>
However, transportation minister Al Palladini says the government
is still considering the higher speed limit and insists he's not
at odds with his cabinet colleague on the issue. Palladini says
he's confident any proposal will make safety a priority. 
<P>
But, Runciman says he's steadfastly opposed to any move to raise
speed limits in urban areas. 
<HR>

<H3>Hospital Demo </H3>

<P>
Hospital workers hit the picket lines today in Toronto, to protest
layoff notices to some 840 employees at Toronto Hospital. 
<P>
The Canadian Union of Public Employees who represents the workers
says they must unite to fight cutbacks that are happening at all
hospitals across the province. 
<HR>

<H3>Welfare Cases </H3>

<P>
The number of welfare cases in Ontario has dropped for the eighth
straight month. 
<P>
Statistics for February show another 36-hundred people stopped
collecting welfare. The Harris government has tightened eligibility
and slashed benefits to trim welfare costs. 
<HR>

<H3>Ontario-Privatization</H3>

<P>
Any provincial agencies sold to the private sector are expected
to face a tough approval process. 
<P>
A published report indicates the province will designate a privatization
minister...and specifics of the move to sell off government agencies
will be included in the may budget. 
<P>
Among provincial assets or services up for privatization are TVOntario,
the LCBO, parts of Ontario Hydro, road maintenance operations
and more than 80-thousand public housing units. 
<HR>

<H3>Day of Protest </H3>

<P>
Back in February, labour shut down the city of Hamilton for two
days to protest the Harris government's cutbacks. 
<P>
Well another day of protest is coming up... and Waterloo is the
target... with public transit, garbage pickup, and recreational
facilities being affected. 
<HR>

<H3>Harris Quebec</H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris says politicians should not get hung up over
language in defining Quebec's role in Canada. 
<P>
Prime Minister Chretien says he is ready to replace distinct society
with a new proposal to call Quebec the &quot;main home&quot; of
French language and culture, in north America. 
<P>
Quebec Deputy Premier Bernard Landry calls the proposal ridiculous
and meaningless. But Ontario's Premier Harris applauds the proposal.

<H3>Pension Reform </H3>

<P>
Is the Canada Pension Plan going broke? Will we have to pay an
arm and a leg to save it? Those are just two of the many questions
Canadians want answered by our federal politicians. 
<HR>

<H3>Moms - OSAP </H3>

<P>
Critics of an Ontario government plan to push college and university
students off welfare... say it will backfire. Within the next
two years, the Tories want single parents and married couples
attending school who are currently on social assistance to apply
for student loans. 
<P>
Some student groups fear that may prevent some welfare recipients
from getting a better education to get off the system. Annette
Hamm reports. 
<P>
<I>June O'Raw wants to wash her hands of the welfare system. A
single mom, she's been supported the last seven years by family
benefits. Last month, she started making arrangements for a better
life, by applying to a hairdressing school. </I>
<P>
<I>Stopped by an Ontario government announcement last week that
single moms on assistance who want to go to school would have
to get off welfare, and have their schooling funded through OSAP
like everyone else. </I>
<P>
<I>Student groups warn that under the government's new plan it
will be harder for those who want to get out of the welfare trap
to help themselves. </I>
<P>
<I>June O'Raw doesn't plan to spend nearly that much on her education,
but she finds the waiting unacceptable. She doesn't want to start
her 10 month course in May, only to find out part way through
her benefits are gone. </I>
<P>
<I>O'Raw says she understands the mess Ontario is in, but urges
the Tory government to stop hitting the ones who are trying to
get off the system. The government will implement its plan to
get students off welfare in the next two years.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Dying Mom </H3>

<P>
A public opinion poll will determine which charities get more
than 112 thousand dollars collected for a Toronto mother who was
reported to be dying of cancer. 
<P>
Bank officials say money donated to Donna Mercier will be handed
to charities chosen in a poll of 400 Toronto area residents. Some
money may go to her seven year old son. 
<P>
Police say Mercier lied to them last week, when she reported her
purse had been snatched. Pollster Angus Reid has offered to conduct
the survey for free. 
<HR>

<H3>Casino Follow </H3>

<P>
What's old is new again. That's the case in Niagara Falls; where
residents have known for two years that eventually they would
hear the official announcement that finally came today. 
<P>
The province of Ontario will build a gaming casino in the city.
<HR>

<H3>Contraception </H3>

<P>
The Canadian Abortion Rights Action League says as many as half
the number of abortions performed in this country could be prevented,
if women were more aware of a safe, and cheaper alternative. 
<P>
&quot;CARAL&quot; is calling on governments and pharmaceutical
companies to do more to educate doctors and the public about the
availability of emergency contraceptives, better known as the
morning-after pill. Doctors say emergency contraceptives are highly-effective
in averting unintended pregnancies. 
<HR>

<H3>Somalia </H3>

<P>
The Canadian Forces has unearthed some missing documents, forcing
an adjournment of the Somalia inquiry until Friday. 
<P>
Lawyers say they need time to examine the six boxes of new documents,
a computer data disk and some crucial Canadian airborne regiment
files that had gone missing. Some of those missing logs date back
to 1993, during Canada's mission to Somalia. 
<P>
They were found in a filing cabinet at CFB Petawawa, home base
of the Canadian Airborne Regiment, after last week's cross country
defence department search. 
<HR>

<H3>Lebanon Monday</H3>

<P>
In world news tonight, another fiery day in southern Lebanon.

<P>
Israeli aircraft continued to bomb Hezbollah targets in Beirut
and southern Lebanon while Hezbollah guerrillas retaliated by
sending more rockets crashing down on Northern Israel. 
<P>
This is the fifth straight day Israel has attacked Lebanon and
although there is no word on casualties from today's attacks,
28 people are reported dead since the fighting began last week.

<H3>Dying Mom </H3>

<P>
Police in Toronto say a woman whose tale of woe prompted the public
to donate more than 100 thousand dollars never had her purse stolen.
But they still believe Donna Mercier is very ill, and deserves
the public's sympathy. 
<P>
Mercier has been charged with public mischief, and police say
they are now consulting with lawyers about what to do with the
money donated to help her and her son. They also say despite the
charge they believe the young mother is terminally ill. 
<HR>

<H3>Giving </H3>

<P>
There is some concern, meanwhile, among those entrusted with raising
funds for major charities, that this incident could undermine
the generosity of contributors. 
<P>
But there is also optimism at both the United Way and the Chedoke
McMaster Hospital Foundation, that those who give will now see
the value of contributing to reputable charities. Anthony Pooley
reports. 
<P>
<I>The outpouring of generosity for Donna Mercier and her son...
with contributions from both Canada and the United States underscores
the willingness of people to help one another... especially those
in dire need. </I>
<P>
<I>But when the 27-year- old woman's story turned out to be highly
questionable... those who gave could well have developed an aversion
to giving.</I>
<P>
<I>At the United Way of Burlington and Hamilton- Wentworth...
fund -raiser Barry English has to oversee a drive to raise more
than 6 million dollars a year... money that community based agencies
need to pay for a variety of charitable endeavors. </I>
<P>
<I>Ursula Evans is in charge of fund-raising for the Chedoke-
McMaster Hospital Foundation... another major organization that
seeks millions each year in financial donations from the community...
notably through the annual Mother's Day Telethon on channel 11.
She sees the outcome of the Donna Mercier incident a little more
positively. </I>
<P>
<I>But in the end, it could well be the reputable charities that
benefit. For it is clear that donated money ends up being used
in the way contributors expect it to be. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Guelph Riot </H3>

<P>
Ontario Tory supporters were given a rough ride as they gathered
for a fundraising dinner in Guelph last night. 
<P>
A police officer was punched in the head and three people were
arrested when rowdy protesters confronted the Tories as they gathered
for the 100 dollar a plate dinner. The guest speaker, Finance
Minister Ernie Eves, avoided the crowd by slipping in a side door.
Two of those arrested face assault and trespassing charges, the
third was let go. 
<HR>

<H3>Tory Ads </H3>

<P>
The Harris government wants to make sure the public gets the right
message about the 1.6 billion dollars in spending cuts, announced
yesterday. 
<P>
Today government ads ran on radio and in major newspapers across
Ontario, putting a positive spin on the cuts and layoffs of government
workers.
<HR>

<H3>Youth Jobs </H3>

<P>
Heritage Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps chose
her hometown to announce a new initiative to create jobs for students.

<P>
At Mohawk College today, Copps said another ten million dollars
will be added to the pot for 350 students to work at national
parks and historical sites across Canada. Museums, libraries and
other cultural institutions will also be offered funding to create
800 new positions. Many will involve opportunities for young people
to travel to other parts of the country to work in another language.

<P>
Copps says the private sector will also be encouraged to do more
to create jobs for youth. 
<HR>

<H3>Food and Wine </H3>

<P>
The perfect pairing of wine and food is a combination that draws
crowds to shows and conventions every spring. Right now the First
Wine and Food Expo in Hamilton is showcasing the wines of the
Niagara region. Kathy Renwald reports. 
<P>
<I>Gone are the days of pairing wine just with cheese. Now the
foods are exotic as the wines are award winners.</I>
<P>
<I>At the Wine and Food Expo at the Hamilton Convention Centre
you can hit the books about wine or pick the hands on route. And
when your palate is perplexed.. then its time for a cleansing
ale. </I>
<P>
<I>Micro brewery products have about 5 per cent of the beer market.
Along with beer there are things to crunch on... lots of lectures
about low fat here.. and the healthful aspects of wine. </I>
<P>
<I>The Food and Wine Expo continues through Sunday at the Convention
Centre.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Cat Reunion </H3>

<P>
It's been almost two weeks since Scarlett the cat, rescued her
five kittens from a fiery building in New York City. 
<P>
Now the kittens, who have been in foster care for the past week,
have been reunited with their heroic mom.

<H3>Dying Mom Update </H3>

<P>
A Toronto mother who was reported to be dying of cancer has been
charged with public mischief. 
<P>
27-year-old Donna Mercier was taken into custody late this afternoon.
She will be released later tonight. 
<P>
Donations topping 110-thousand dollars poured in for the woman
and her seven-year-old son after reports her purse was stolen
last week. An investigation was launched after anonymous callers
questioned her story. 
<HR>

<H3>Ontario Cuts </H3>

<P>
Over the next two years, ten thousand civil servants in this province
will be handed pinks slips. The announcement came today as the
government tries to trim its budget by 4.5 billion dollars. 
<P>
Residents will soon be paying more for everything from marriage
licenses and tourist attractions to public housing. 
<HR>

<H3>120 km/h </H3>

<P>
Are we driving too fast? maybe not, says Transport Minister Al
Palladini. 
<P>
Improved road technology, safer cars, and legions of rebellious
drivers, have made the posted speed limit of 100 kilometers an
hour; virtually meaningless. That's why the minister may be considering
some new signs; that could raise maximum speeds, and require minimum
speeds, on major provincial highways. Scot Urquhart has more:

<P>
<I>The speed limit is 100. But cars on Canada's busiest highway,
routinely ignore the rules .... OPP Sergeant John Mason says,
a suggestion by Transport Minister Al Palladini to bump the posted
speed limit to 120 kilometers an hour ... doesn't really worry
him. Speed isn't the problem. aggressive behaviour ... is. </I>
<P>
<I>Bob Pring, is with the Insurance Bureau of Canada. He agrees
with John Mason ... speed isn't really a factor.  In fact, slow
drivers, can be just as dangerous, and worse yet says Pring ...
many of us aren't paying attention, no matter what speed we drive.</I>
<P>
<I>Both the police, and the insurance companies say ... it's not
number on the sign that matters; it's what we do with it.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Sisters Drown </H3>

<P>
A family, northwest of Kitchener is in mourning today, after two
young sisters fell through the ice of a partially frozen pond
on their grandfather's farm. 
<P>
Four year old Lena Martin and her three year old sister Naomi
were trapped under water for up to 30 minutes before rescue workers
reached them. Their five year old cousin, Cindy Martin, was rescued
by a neighbor who slid across the ice to the hole where the girls
had fallen through. 
<HR>

<H3>Pint Sized Pilot </H3>

<P>
A seven year old girl has been killed in an attempt to become
the youngest pilot ever to fly across the United States. 
<P>
A plane flown by Jessica Dubroff, crashed in a rainstorm in Cheyenne,
Wyoming. The little girl, her father and a flight instructor were
all killed in the crash. 
<HR>

<H3>Beirut Attack </H3>

<P>
For the first time in 14 years, Israeli aircraft have attacked
the Lebanese capital of Beirut. 
<P>
Helicopters fired rockets at the city's southern suburbs, where
pro-Iranian Hezbollah rebels are based. 
<P>
Hours earlier, Israeli aircraft struck in eastern and southern
Lebanon to avenge Hezbollah attacks that killed an Israeli soldier
and injured 38 other people in the past three days. 
<HR>

<H3>Bernard Goetz </H3>

<P>
It's been more than eleven years since Bernard Goetz opened fire
on a group of black teenagers on a New York City subway car, after
the group tried to rob him of five dollars. 
<P>
Goetz claimed he fired in self defense and was acquitted of attempted
murder in the case.. but today he was back in court facing civil
charges.
<HR>

<H3>Harding Divorce </H3>

<P>
And in the where are they now category... Tonya Harding has filed
for divorce from Michael Smith, whom she married three and a-half
months ago. 
<P>
Harding's agent says she doesn't want any distractions as she
focuses on her skating comeback. Yes, the bad girl of ice skating
is attempting a comeback. 
<P>
For those who are counting, it was her second marriage, and his
fourth.

<H3>Salaries-Pensions</H3>

<P>
Members of the Ontario Legislature are getting a pay cut. 
<P>
Finance Minister Ernie Eves says MPP's will lose their tax-free
allowances and benefits under legislation introduced today. Also
gone is the gold-plated pension plan. 
<HR>

<H3>Johnson-Cuts</H3>

<P>
Tomorrow the Harris government will outline how it expects to
chop between 4- and 5-and-a-half billion dollars in government
spending, over the next fiscal year. 
<P>
Chairman of the Management Board, Dave Johnson, says the long-overdue
fiscal restructuring, will be aimed at delivering core services
at a lower cost. And he says the government may get out of the
delivery of some services, altogether. 
<P>
Johnson is expected to announce the final number of government
workers to be cut very soon. Some 15-hundred have already received
their notices. At least 13-thousand are expected to be let go.

<HR>

<H3>Dying Mom Follow </H3>

<P>
Metro Toronto police are checking out the story of a woman whose
reported purse snatching and battle with cancer prompted an outpouring
of sympathy and cash. 
<P>
So far more than 112 thousand dollars has poured in for the woman,
who said she was dying, and for her young son. 
<P>
Detective Sergeant John Sillotts says police are now following
up on calls from people who have discredited the woman. He says
they will hold onto the money, until they are sure the woman's
story is true. 
<HR>

<H3>Adoptions </H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris says his government can't be blamed for the
woes of families on welfare. 
<P>
A Simcoe County Children's Aid Society worker says some families
are considering giving their kids up for adoption because of cuts
in welfare support. 
<P>
Though the Premier has doubts about the story, Finance Minister
Ernie Eves indicated some action might be taken. 
<HR>

<H3>30-Hour Week </H3>

<P>
Less work for some, more work for all ... and a chance to share
the wealth more evenly. That's the idea behind the 30 hour work
week. 
<P>
Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall has kicked off a debate on the issue;
that has angered the business community; encouraged social advocates;
and sent economists scrambling to their computers. Scot Urquhart
has more: 
<P>
<I>Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall knows how hard it can be, to help
.... but although she was harangued by the poor ... Hall has more
than nickels and dimes on her mind ... when it comes to ways to
help. she has floated the idea of a 30 hour work week; as a way
of spreading the work around, and sharing the wealth in Canadian
society. </I>
<P>
<I>But the Hall proposal has been panned by business; and McMaster
University economist Alan Harrison says; the so-called gap between
rich and poor, may in fact be little more than a sliver. </I>
<P>
<I>Labour unions on the other hand, say Hall is right on the mark.
 From the steelworkers point of view, corporate Canada can afford
to be a little more generous. </I>
<P>
<I>But Harrison sees an economic price; that social advocates
may not ... employment costs, payroll costs, benefits, payroll
taxes ... all of them make it very expensive to add a worker to
a company ... and in this area Harrison says, various levels of
government could help. </I>
<P>
<I>It seems then, that no matter how you look at it; when it comes
to the 30 hour work week ... someone, somewhere, will have to
pay.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Canadian Killed </H3>

<P>
A man shot while vacationing in Trinidad, is the fifth Canadian
murdered on the Caribbean island in the last two years. 
<P>
Police say 27 year old Kurt Hosein of Thornhill, Ontario, was
shot while sitting in a car with his cousin, outside a relative's
home in a suburb of port of Spain Sunday night. A newspaper reporter
says a stolen car the assailant is believed to have used, has
been found. Police are checking it for forensic evidence. 
<HR>

<H3>Tyson Sex </H3>

<P>
Boxer Mike Tyson could be facing more legal problems. Police are
investigating a woman's complaint of sexual battery against Tyson,
stemming from an alleged incident at a Chicago nightclub. 
<P>
Tyson has not been charged, but the owner of the club is already
speaking up in his defence. 
<HR>

<H3>Royal Media Spat </H3>

<P>
For the first time since the days when kings could chop off the
heads of those who displeased them, Britain's royal family is
taking up arms against intrusions, hounding, and teasing by the
media.

<H3>Fyke Killer </H3>

<P>
Although a mentally disabled teenager has already confessed to
the murder of a Belleville high school student, police in Daytona
Beach Florida, now say they have the real killer. 
<P>
17 year old John Rainey turned himself in to police and was charged
today with the first degree murder of Mark Fyke. 
<P>
Fyke was killed in a botched robbery during spring break. Police
had been holding 18 year old Donald Shoup who turned himself in
after the shooting. A Daytona beach newspaper says investigators
knew a short time later that Shoup was not the killer. 
<HR>

<H3>Victim Evng</H3>

<P>
In Toronto, a dying mother quietly thanked hundreds of generous
strangers today, ... people who gave her money and gifts after
she was robbed on a city street. 
<P>
Last week, the 27 year old woman had her purse snatched while
walking in Toronto. She lost a small amount of cash, her identification
and health card and a bus ticket to Winnipeg, where her son may
be sent to live when she dies. 
<P>
Soon after her plight became public, donations from across Canada
began to pour in, but now the woman says enough is enough. The
young mother who has cancer, has asked that an account which has
collected over 70 thousand dollars, be closed, and that help stop
pouring in. 
<P>
The 27 year old woman, asked that her identity remain secret,
fearing an abusive partner. 
<HR>

<H3>COPE-Booze </H3>

<P>
A group of food retailers uncorked an old debate today, urging
the province to allow supermarkets and corner stores to sell beer
and wine. 
<P>
The Coalition for Ontario Private Enterprise says stores that
handle alcohol could be regulated with a strict series of rules
ensuring that no one under age is sold a bottle. The organization
even released draft legislation on how the idea could come about.

<HR>

<H3>Budget Cuts </H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris has not ruled out more spending cuts on top
of the eight billion dollars in cuts already announced. 
<P>
Harris was asked today about reports his government is going to
cut another 4.3 billion dollars. The Premier said the government
has no plans for such spending cuts at this point in time. But
Harris was quick to add... times can change. 
<HR>

<H3>Somalia Document </H3>

<P>
Military personnel across the country have begun the momentous
task of combing their files for documents related to Canada's
ill fated Somalia mission. 
<P>
The order for the one day sweep through defence department files,
came after important documents in the investigation disappeared.
Although some Somalia related documents were found today at CFB
Petawawa, a base spokesman has described them as nothing more
than routine paperwork. 
<P>
Critics have called the search nothing more than a public relations
ploy, but it too may be backfiring. 
<HR>

<H3>Parole </H3>

<P>
A coalition of social groups wants the federal government to retain
a controversial section of the criminal code that allows convicted
murderers early parole. 
<P>
Those convicted of first degree murder receive an automatic sentence
of life without parole for 25 years. But section 745 allows them
to apply for parole after 15 years. 
<P>
Reform MP's say that's a lenient loophole that should be closed...
some critics disagree. 
<HR>

<H3>Oklahoma Bombing </H3>

<P>
The first of many pre-trial hearings in the Oklahoma City bombing
trial began today in Denver, the new site for the trial. 
<P>
Defendants Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols are demanding reams
of government documents they claim is evidence that might help
their case. The hearings are being held under the most extraordinary
security the city has ever seen.
<HR>

<H3>Chernobyl Anniversary </H3>

<P>
It's been almost ten years since the Chernobyl nuclear reactor
exploded a cloud of radioactive poison into the air. 
<P>
This week, experts and politicians from around the world have
gathered in Vienna to discuss the impact of the accident and what
can be done for its survivors. But for many victims, no amount
of discussion will ever help.

eggs into one Easter basket. 
<P>

meeting on national unity; is tentatively set for June 20th. The
two day conference will include Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard;
but sources say the date could be changed, if a summer election
is called by BC. premier Glen Clark. 
<HR>

<H3>Doctors Jobless </H3>

<P>
There are too many big city doctors in Ontario... and not enough
patients to support them. So says the Ontario government. And
because of that, new doctors in the province may be forced to
leave Ontario to practice ... or find themselves on the unemployment
line. 
<HR>

<H3>Cancer-Gene</H3>

<P>
While doctors in Ontario are wondering about the &quot;where's&quot;
of medicine ... doctors in Philadelphia; are wondering about the
&quot;why's&quot;. In particular ... they are looking at a genetic
link to lung cancer; and believe they may have found a key, to
that deadly disease.
<HR>

<H3>GO Fatal </H3>

<P>
An accident on the GO Transit line in east end Toronto this afternoon,
has claimed the life of an unidentified woman. 
<P>
Police say the victim was hit by a train near Guildwood Station
around noon. The accident forced the temporary closure of the
line ... as transit traffic was re-routed around the accident
scene. No other details of the accident, are yet available. 
<HR>

<H3>Soul Voc </H3>

<P>
A Canadian version of the so-called, million man march ... was
small, but significant, according to organizers. 
<P>
Dubbed &quot;Soultrek&quot; the Good Friday march in downtown
Toronto, was promoted as a gathering of atonement, and reconciliation.
The march ended in a noon hour rally at Oakwood Collegiate; where
organizer Don Mohammed addressed the crowd.
<HR>

<H3>Via Dolorosa </H3>

<P>
Half a world away ... another march for atonement and reconciliation
... this one in Jerusalem ... where religious pilgrims took part
in the traditional Good Friday walk, on the Via Dolorosa. The
path is believed to be the same one that Christ followed to his
crucifixion. 
<HR>

<H3>Pope-Confessions </H3>

<P>
And in Rome ... Pope John Paul heard the confessions of 12 penitents
... gathered from countries around the world... as part of his
Good Friday tradition. 
<P>
Later in the day, the pontiff carried a wooden cross around the
exterior of Rome's coliseum, in a symbolic re-creation of Christ's
journey to Golgotha. 
<HR>

<H3>Hawk Watch </H3>

<P>
And on this Good Friday, in the Niagara peninsula ... scores of
eyes were turned towards the heavens ... for a sign of something
to send the spirits soaring. 
<P>
Though not divine; some would say that the aerial show above Grimsby,
is indeed, a gift from god: Deborah Walker explains: 
<P>
<I>For twenty years now, naturalists have perched atop the Niagara
escarpment in the Beamer Conservation Area, to tally the number
of raptors who sail overhead on their way to northern breeding
grounds. The raptors come this way to skirt the open waters of
lake Ontario and lake Erie, searching instead for the thermals
that rise from the warming earth and carry them aloft. </I>
<P>
<I>Today, turkey vultures are a common sight. Other sightings
evoke a more thrilling reaction. Every day, from the first of
march to the middle of may, someone is stationed here to continue
the count. And once each season, on Good Friday, the naturalists
invite the public to share their passion. </I>

<HR>

<H3>School Reform</H3>

<P>
A group called the Coalition for Education Reform warns that Ontario's
education system is headed for disaster. And that the Harris government
is preparing to devastate high school education. 
<HR>

<H3>Fergus Walkout</H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, students from across the province continue to protest
cuts to the education system. 
<P>
Today, hundreds of students in Fergus, north of Guelph ... walked
out of class; after the Wellington Board of Education sent out
layoff notices to more than 300 employees, including one hundred-eleven
teachers. The protest mirrored similar walkouts earlier this week,
in Niagara falls, Belleville, and Belle River. 
<HR>

<H3>UI-Young </H3>

<P>
And it seems that young people are the most discouraged of all,
when it comes to looking for work. 
<P>
New figures from stats can show the jobless rate dropped to 9.3
percent in March ... down three-tenths of a point from February.

<P>
But analysts say some 30-thousand young adults, gave up looking
for work completely.... while another 20-thousand, lost jobs they
already had. 
<HR>

<H3>Workfare-Rxn </H3>

<P>
The desperation over unemployment comes just as the province is
beginning to take the wraps off of its new, Workfare scheme. 
<P>
The plan is to make able bodied recipients work for their welfare
cheques ... but many people are still wondering just how it will
work, and perhaps ... how it won't. Annette Hamm has more: 
<P>
<I>Before venturing out as a self proclaimed starving artist Paul
Benvenuti was on welfare. If worse comes to worse he says he'd
do anything other than go back on welfare under the new Ontario
Works Program. </I>
<P>
<I>The province will give communities 100 million dollars to create
17 hours of work a week for every person on general welfare assistance,
except those who are disabled, over 65 or those with kids under
3. The jobs may include digging ditches or painting rec centres.
</I>
<P>
<I>Susan West of Hamilton Wentworth's Social Planning and Research
Council agrees. She feels rather than make work projects, taxpayers
money would be better spent retraining welfare recipients with
real job skills for real jobs that are open. But the man behind
Workfare insists his plan will be a made in Ontario solution.
</I>
<P>
<I>Ontario Works will begin this year in 15 as yet unnamed municipalities.
</I>
<HR>

<H3>Cop - Silence </H3>

<P>
Members of the government, meanwhile ... took a moment in the
provincial legislature to pay tribute to OPP Constable Michael
Gula. Gula was struck and killed as he stood at the side of the
QEW near Niagara Falls, Tuesday night. 
<P>
Solicitor General Bob Runciman characterized Gula as a well liked
and dedicated member of the OPP, who was involved with his community.

<P>
67 year old Frank Jacob Vanderkley has been charged with failing
to remain at the scene. He made a brief appearance in court and
was released on a thousand dollars bail; pending his next appearance,
May 2. 
<HR>

<H3>Unabomber </H3>

<P>
Police in the United States, meanwhile, are confident that they
have found the man that has eluded them for nearly two decades.

<P>
A Montana hermit: Theodore John Kaczynski; has been arrested and
held on charges of possessing the components of a bomb. Police
say that he ... is the infamous Unabomber: 
<HR>

<H3>Crime Profits </H3>

<P>
It's been done in the United States for quite a while ... but
federal authorities here in Canada have now signed agreements
with four provinces, to share the proceeds of property seized
by customs and the RCMP, in drug raids. 
<P>
Ontario, BC., New Brunswick and the Yukon, have signed the deal.
Authorities say the money will help them to keep criminals from
profiting from drug crimes.

<HR>

<H3>Tax Cut Fight </H3>

<P>
Visible hardships caused by massive cuts in provincial spending
are prompting some Ontarians to wonder if it's all worth it. 
<P>
There are those who suggest that the deepest wounds are being
inflicted as the Harris government attempts to find ways to finance
its promised tax cut. So today, a lobby group issued an appeal,
asking Ontarians to tell their legislators to scrap the planned
tax cut, and restore some of the spending that has been axed.
But the premier remains adamant. 
<HR>

<H3>Johnson-Harassment </H3>

<P>
The chairman of the Management Board of the Ontario Cabinet says
he won't stand for any harassment of government workers who crossed
the picket lines during the recent civil service strike. 
<P>
Dave Johnson says he has heard rumors of some government employees
giving others the cold shoulder. Johnson says if it doesn't stop,
disciplinary action will be taken. 
<P>
Johnson also says the announcement of the layoff of some 13-thousand
government workers will come before the spring budget in may.

<HR>

<H3>NDP Debate </H3>

<P>
Provincial New Democrats will be electing a new party leader this
summer. 
<P>
Welland- Thorold MPP Peter Kormos and three other delegates are
vying for the job vacated by former Premier bob Rae. 
<P>
Nearly three hundred people showed up to hear the contestants
debate the issues last night. Ian Dovey reports. 
<P>
<I>There are the heart and sole of the New Democratic Party, shop
stewards, community activists, riding executive members ...each
one a new democrat 365 days of the year. </I>
<P>
<I>It's people like Scot who will pick a new party leader this
summer. And under the leadership of either Francis Lankin, Howard
Hampton, Tony Silipo or Peter Kormos a more mature New Democratic
Party will emerge.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Double Murder </H3>

<P>
A Bowmanville man faces two counts of second-degree murder after
his daughter and his mother were found stabbed to death. 
<P>
The two were found in their home yesterday morning. Police have
identified the victims as six-year-old Jennifer England and 74-year-old
Marion Johnston. Charged is 45-year-old Ronald England.
<HR>

<H3>Pit Bull Attack </H3>

<P>
A Kitchener father had to use a baseball bat to fight off a pit
bull attacking his 4-year-old daughter today. 
<P>
The incident and similar attacks have resulted in calls for controls
on both the dogs and their owners. Kitchener City Council is now
considering a by-law that places a series of specific controls
on pit bulls and their owners. 
<P>
But they may need a change in provincial law to allow them to
single out a particular breed. 
<HR>

<H3>Laparascopy Study </H3>

<P>
There's a medical marvel that's been around for almost ten years,
and it's just now beginning to get the recognition it deserves,
and no wonder, with healthcare budgets being cut, Laparoscopic
surgery is being viewed in Ontario as a perfect way to cut out
disease, cut hospital stays, cut costs and cut recovery time.
Jamie West reports. 
<P>
<I>Dr. Adrian Park and his colleagues at Hamilton's St. Joseph's
Hospital are just back from the 5th World Congress of Laparoscopic
Surgery in Philadelphia. </I>
<P>
<I>Park and his partner Dr. Mehran Anvari travel the world teaching
surgeon's how to use the laparoscope, a narrow tube inserted into
the patient's abdomen through the navel allowing the surgeon to
see inside and perform operations using tiny cutting instruments
inserted through tiny incisions... the patient's abdomen is filled
with gas to create an open field to view all the abdominal organs.
</I>
<P>
<I>This patient will have her gall bladder removed...it will take
about a half hour and she'll likely go home later the same day.
The large open incision method for this operation would have included
a minimum 5 day hospital stay and 6 weeks of recovery at home.
</I>
<P>
<I>Dr. Park would like to see more doctors using this proven technique,
but he would like to ensure proper training before unqualified
surgeons jump on the bandwagon. </I>
<P>
<I>30-year old Julie Dinardo is a patient who suffered from ulcerative
colitis ... 43-year old Darla Vincent a kidney recipient...had
a an enlarged adrenal gland removed... and 43-year old Maria Italiano
underwent stomach surgery... Park says St. Joseph's hospital taking
the lead in Laparoscopic surgery couldn't have come at a better
time.</I>

<H3>Women's Centre Woes </H3>

<P>
We begin tonight with the story of a shelter for abused women
in Niagara falls. 
<P>
Nova House is operating under a cloud of controversy, amid complaints
from former residents and employees that management is throwing
money away while staff are being laid off and services cut. Local
politicians are beginning to question how taxpayers money is being
spent. And as Lauran Sabourin reports tonight... the shelter is
now the focus of an outside review. 
<P>
<I>The shelter's annual budget is 430 thousand dollars a year.
Salaries account for the lion's share of that budget. </I>
<P>
<I>To save money the board is considering closing the shelter
at midnight. </I>
<P>
<I>Willie Tracey calls himself a concerned taxpayer. He's been
questioning where and how the shelter's money is being spent.
</I>
<P>
<I>Responding to an ad in the local newspaper former residents
at Nova said they too were concerned about the cutbacks. &quot;Women
get abused and killed any day. How can you tell a desperate woman
not today dear, come back later. Later, in some cases might be
too late, or she might end up in the hospital like I did.&quot;
</I>
<P>
<I>Current and former employees at Nova complain that closing
the shelter at night isn't necessary. They say they've seen money
being thrown away; on a housekeeper whose primary function is
to buy groceries, on a child care worker who only works during
the day while the kids are in school. Toddlers are looked after
by their mothers. Jobs that are filled by friends and relatives
of Nova House board members. They say friends and family members
are hired while abuse counselors are being laid off or forced
to leave. </I>
<P>
<I>Sonia Sentinel was an abused woman. She stayed at Nova House
for four weeks last year. Sonia says she was ignored and at times
ridiculed by certain staff members. </I>
<P>
<I>Board members at Nova House refused to discuss these allegations.
They say the operation is under review. A consultant has been
hired. A report should be filed by the summer.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Bowmanville Slaying </H3>

<P>
Durham Regional Police are questioning a man in his 30's after
a six-year-old girl and her grandmother were slain in Bowmanville.

<P>
Police arrived at the home around 7:30 this morning. The victims
were apparently stabbed to death. No names have been released
yet.
<HR>

<H3>Ipperwash Firearms </H3>

<P>
Investigators probing last year's deadly standoff at Ipperwash
Provincial Park haven't found any weapons that police allege sparked
the shooting. 
<P>
Provincial police say they shot and killed 38-year-old Anthony
&quot;Dudley&quot; George last September because he had a gun.

<P>
The Chippewa who were occupying the park, near Sarnia on Lake
Huron, maintain they were not armed. Ontario's Special Investigations
Unit has been probing the shooting for more than seven months.

<P>
George's family has launched a wrongful death lawsuit against
Premier Mike Harris... alleging he directed police to use severe
action against the protesters. The premier says he gave police
no such orders. 
<HR>

<H3>Molester Released </H3>

<P>
Texas prison officials now say it could be a couple days before
an admitted child molester is released. 
<P>
Larry McQuay claims he has molested more than 200 children and
will do it again if released. Prison officials say they're making
sure he's served all his required time. 
<HR>

<H3>Virus Blocker </H3>

<P>
A new drug for combating AIDS has hit the Canadian market. 
<P>
The manufacturer of Invirase says it's not a miracle cure for
the deadly disease. But Hoffman-Laroche says when combined with
drugs like AZT, it delivers an effective one-two punch to help
people live longer. 
<P>
The drug inhibits the enzyme HIV protease, which helps the AIDS-virus
mature in the body. 
<P>
Invirase is now available in four countries, but can cost a patient
78- hundred dollars a year. Hoffman- Laroche is working with officials
in the provinces to get subsidies for AIDS patients. 
<HR>

<H3>Women - Pain </H3>

<P>
When it comes to chronic pain do women suffer more than men? A
newly released Stats Canada study indicates that in general women
do suffer more mental and distress as well as physical pain. But
as Jamie West reports ...there are a several logical reasons why
that is the case.... 
<P>
<I>Differences between men and women are nothing new. But when
it comes to consumption of healthcare and which group suffers
more pain the numbers seem to go against women... Stats Canada
says that one in five women suffer chronic pain compared to one
in seven men... </I>
<P>
<I>Dr. Chris Ricci is a chronic pain specialist at Hamilton Civic
Hospitals.. according to statistics consumption of pain medications
is also higher among women at 88 percent, compared to men at 74
percent... </I>
<P>
<I>Dr. Ricci is quick to point out that big ticket healthcare
items like joint replacement and heart surgery are virtually equal
among both genders... and that women are better communicators
of their healthcare needs than men... </I>
<P>
<I>It was not clear whether the Stats Canada analysis took into
account the fact the women live longer than men, but did say all
forms of chronic pain increase with age.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Welfare Clothes </H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris says there are no plans to cut the clothing
allowance of children on welfare. 
<P>
He says he doesn't know where these stories come from. The Globe
and Mail says it has obtained government documents about a plan
to reduce spending on the poor by 743- million dollars. 
<P>
The report added the province might raise rents in public housing,
charge welfare recipients drug-plan user fees and cut spending
for the physically and mentally handicapped. 
<P>
Social Services Minister David Tsubouchi says cuts for the handicapped
have not been discussed.

<H3>Edwards Quits </H3>

<P>
The head of Canada's prison system has quit. John Edwards resigned
today after reading Justice Louise Arbour's report into the 1994
disturbances at Kingston's Prison for Women. 
<P>
The report blasts the prison service, saying it showed a disturbing
lack of commitment to the ideals of justice. Judge Arbour says
there is no evidence of a willingness to reform, and it appears
only tighter judicial control will lead to changes. 
<P>
Arbour's report says guards ignored the law by placing six prisoners
into segregation cells in April 1994. When that raised tensions
to the boiling point, the correctional service again ignored the
law and ordered an all-male emergency response team into the prison
... which strip searched female prisoners. 
<HR>

<H3>OPSEU Returns-CUPE </H3>

<P>
Thousands of Ontario public servants returned to work today, following
five weeks on strike against the Harris government. 
<P>
But thousands will soon be out of a job, as Queen's Park gets
set to pare their ranks by more than 13-thousand. And there are
animosities among OPSEU members because of those who crossed picket
lines and went to work. To make matters worse, someone called
in a bomb scare... delaying the return to government business
at the Ontario Legislature. 
<HR>

<H3>Tainted Water </H3>

<P>
A Burlington company has been hired to help purify the drinking
water in Collingwood. 
<P>
Zenon Environmental will provide emergency treatment equipment
to the town to eliminate a deadly parasite that somehow got into
local waters. 
<P>
Residents in the Georgian Bay community have been buying bottled
water or boiling their own after 127 people became sick with a
flu like disease. Attempts to pinpoint the source of the elusive
bug continued today, with sampling of the local water supply at
the towns outdated treatment plant. And the search will likely
expand throughout the spring to nearby rivers which flow through
cattle grazing pastures of the Niagara Escarpment. 
<HR>

<H3>Train Derailment </H3>

<P>
Ontario Northland Railways officials suspect sabotage or accidental
tampering to be behind a train derailment near North Bay. 
<P>
The train's engineer noticed something wrong with a track switch
yesterday and hit the emergency brake. That caused five of six
cars of the Toronto-bound train to jump the tracks. The cars remained
upright. 
<P>
fifty passengers were on the train and there were no serious injuries.
A railway spokesman says it could have been vandalism or a passing
truck that hit the switch. 
<HR>

<H3>Hospital Cuts </H3>

<P>
A 4.6- million-dollar shortfall means job cuts at Peel Memorial
Hospital in Brampton. 
<P>
President Bruce Harbor says 200 jobs must be eliminated through
layoffs, early retirements and resignations. Workers will start
finding out which jobs are getting the ax tomorrow. Twenty-nine
beds are also being closed. 
<HR>

<H3>Florio Bunten</H3>

<P>
There may have been jury tampering in the so-called &quot;trial
of the century&quot;. 
<P>
A report on the CBS public affairs program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;
raised the possibility last night in an interview with a juror
who was dismissed because a letter implicated her in a post-trial
book deal. But there is mounting evidence that the letter was
a fake. 
<HR>

<H3>Passover Feast </H3>

<P>
Passover begins this Thursday, and Jews around the world will
begin a special week long diet to celebrate. This year, shopping
for Passover items is better than ever, with stores continuing
to improve their selection. Annette Hamm reports. 
<P>
<I>Over the last couple of weeks, grocery shoppers may have noticed
large kosher displays in many supermarkets. Retailers are gearing
up for the biggest food event of the Jewish calendar ... Passover.
</I>
<P>
<I>Jack Wright is a service consultant for the Fortino's Supermarket
at Dundurn Plaza in Hamilton. He says the selection of kosher
for Passover foods has increased quite a bit over the past few
years, as modern conveniences are added to the traditional staples
Jews took with them during their hurried exodus out of Egypt in
biblical times. </I>
<P>
<I>The thin bread is the basis for the bland, Passover diet, which
includes Unleven products, or those which don't rise. Any products
with these symbols, which mean they are approved by a rabbi for
cleanliness, are suitable for Passover. </I>
<P>
<I>Many of the items are displayed on white paper, another symbol
of cleanliness. Even selected liquor stores are expanding their
kosher products. Passover begins at sundown on Thursday, and continues
for a week.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>April Fool's </H3>

<P>
If you woke up somewhere in England today and forgot it was April
first, you might have gotten your leg pulled by made-up stories
in London's fun-loving newspapers. 
<P>
One paper reported that a royal Internet war is in the offing,
with both the Queen and Princess Diana setting up rival web pages.

<P>
Another carried a story about new key rings and refrigerator magnets
carrying pictures of Britain's new bewigged judges. Another had
a made-up ad on the latest innovation in cars: an IDS or insect
detection system from BMW designed to protect windshields from
insects. 
<P>
Another carried an ad on a &quot;new ...left-handed&quot; Mars
chocolate bar.

<H3>OPSEU Deal? </H3>

<P>
There's no quick end in sight to the Ontario government workers
strike. After high hopes of a tentative settlement yesterday,
negotiators are still hashing out details at the bargaining table
in Toronto. 
<HR>

<H3>Milton Theft</H3>

<P>
A former Vice-President of the Royal Bank's brokerage house has
been charged with bilking investors out of almost six million
dollars. 
<P>
RCMP arrested 53 year old Christopher Edmunston Horne today at
his home in the posh Toronto neighborhood of Rosedale. He faces
13 counts of fraud and theft. 
<P>
Police allege that between 1987 and 1994, clients funds were illegally
channeled through an account under his control. 
<HR>

<H3>Trail Dispute </H3>

<P>
A Burlington home owner is hot on the trails of the Niagara Escarpment
Commission. 
<P>
He's angry the commission won't let him sever his land for development.
To fight back, he's decided to block access to the Bruce Trail
from his property. Annette Hamm has the story. 
<P>
<I>Harry Zahoruk is putting up his last fight against the Niagara
Escarpment Commission. The Burlington lawyer is denying access
to part of the Bruce Trail, which runs through his 65 acre property.
</I>
<P>
<I>The fight started when Zahoruk applied to sever his land to
build a home for his partner. But the commission said no. The
original 100 acres where Harry Zahoruk lives was divided once
into 6 parcels of land, and the commission's plan only allows
one severance in the Niagara protection area of the escarpment.
Zahoruk proposed that if he was allowed to sever the land again,
he'd give the Bruce Trail Association a parking lot and permanent
right of way on his land. </I>
<P>
<I>Joan Little is chair of the Niagara Escarpment Commission.
She doesn't want the Bruce Trail used as a pawn in the dispute,
and fears giving Zahoruk his severance would set a dangerous precedence.
And it appears Harry Zahoruk won't. He's ready to give up and
sell his property.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Martin-GST </H3>

<P>
Finance Minister Paul Martin has rejected Ontario's claim that
merging its provincial sales tax with the GST will suck billions
out of the pockets of consumers. 
<P>
Martin says the federal government's plan for GST harmonization
will bring in no more money than the current sales-tax system.
Ontario has so far rejected Martin's overtures to merge its provincial
sales tax with the GST, into a new 15 percent national sales tax.

<HR>

<H3>Copps - Quebec </H3>

<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps says there's no way Quebec
delegates working out of Canadian embassies, will be allowed to
peddle separation. Copps was responding to comments by Quebec
International Affairs Minister Sylvain Simard. 
<P>
The PQ government has announced it will close 13 of 19 foreign
delegations. Simard said some Quebec representatives will work
out of Canadian embassies around the world, and could sell sovereignty
along with trade. 
<HR>

<H3>Freemen Friday </H3>

<P>
Tensions remain high in Montana today, where a showdown between
federal authorities and a right wing separatist group drags on.
Several of the so-called Freemen are hold up on a farm... while
two others in the group went to court today. 
<HR>

<H3>France Raid </H3>

<P>
French police killed three suspected robbers in a Shootout near
the northern city of Lihl, site of next Mondays group of seven
meeting. A fourth suspected robber, who fled the scene, was later
killed by Belgian police. 
<P>
French officials insist the clashes today, and an attempted car
bombing last night, involved criminals not terrorists. The bomb
was discovered about 300 metres from the hall where G-7 labor
and economics ministers open a conference on Monday. 
<HR>

<H3>Japan HIV </H3>

<P>
Japan's government and five drug companies have agreed to compensate
people who've been infected with the AIDS virus through untreated
blood. 
<P>
Last month, the government admitted it knew of the risks, but
still didn't pull the blood products off the market. as part of
today's settlements, the government and drug makers also apologized.
In all, nearly two thousand people in Japan, mostly hemophiliacs,
became infected with HIV in the 1980's because of untreated blood.

<HR>

<H3>Mad Cow Justice </H3>

<P>
The world health organization will hold an emergency meeting in
Geneva next week to discuss the possible dangers of &quot;mad
cow disease&quot;. Health experts plan to make safety recommendations
at that time. 
<P>
Consumer panic ensued after British scientists linked the disease
to a condition in humans. But, what is considered a crisis in
one culture can be considered divine intervention in another.

<H3>OPSEU Latest </H3>

<P>
Ontario's first public service strike is all but over. And an
agreement could be announced later tonight. 
<P>
Earlier today, hundreds of striking civil servants made a final
show of strength, as they again made people wait fifteen minutes
before letting them enter the Ontario legislature. 
<P>
OPSEU President Leah Casselman was wildly cheered by her supporters
at a noon-hour rally. Casselman told fellow members that negotiators
have just one issue to resolve .. details on a return to work.

<P>
If a contract deal is reached tonight, voting could take place
tomorrow, and government workers might very well be back on the
job as early as Saturday. 
<HR>

<H3>Long Term Health </H3>

<P>
In other news tonight, the sick and frail will be getting more
help at home, but nursing homes are facing cuts. 
<P>
Health Minister Jim Wilson announced a dramatic shakeup of community
based health care today. Wilson has allocated an additional 170
million dollars for homecare, but is chopping 30 percent funding
from nursing homes. 
<HR>

<H3>MUMC Business </H3>

<P>
And with provincial funding of hospitals expected to be cut to
the bone over the next the decade; the &quot;business&quot; of
healthcare in Ontario is getting the attention of hospital administrators
like never before. 
<P>
As Jamie West reports tonight ...Hamilton's Chedoke McMaster Hospitals
are turning to it's staff to invent new &quot;revenue generating
ideas&quot; that will ensure continued high quality patient care...

<P>
<I>Chedoke McMaster teamed up with the McMaster University's Michael
DeGroote School of Business to create a fast track marketing course
for health care workers. </I>
<P>
<I>Nancy Carter a registered pediatric nurse was one of 30 candidates
chosen to take the course out of some 300 who applied. </I>
<P>
<I>Inside the classroom with the help of business instructors
small groups develop their revenue generating plans that's just
one of 600 hundred ideas already generated in the class... the
course is intense.. consisting of 16 four hour sessions, the initiative
will be evaluated by hospital brass in six months to see how many
of the money making ideas are in practice at that time. </I>
<P>
<I>The hospital's goal is to reduce it's reliance on government
funding by 50 percent within 10 years. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Sick Kids Boss </H3>

<P>
And while some hospitals in Ontario are doing what they can to
trim costs, it's been learned the President of the Hospital for
Sick Children in Toronto, is one of the highest paid health administrators
in the country. 
<P>
Information obtained under a provincial disclosure act, shows
that Michael Strofolino earns about 500 thousand dollars a year....
that's about five times the salary paid to the premier. 
<HR>

<H3>Midwife</H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, the Harris government plans to appoint an unemployed
car salesman to a provincial body that oversees midwives. 
<P>
Dan Callaghan worked for an auto dealer in Petawawa from 1990
to 1995. He also ran for the Tories in the Renfrew North riding
last June but lost to the Liberal incumbent. 
<P>
Some members of the legislature are questioning Callaghan's qualifications
and his interest in midwifery. 
<HR>

<H3>Red Cross </H3>

<P>
The Red Cross will no longer stop parents from storing blood intended
for their children. The blood agency is reversing its policy after
a national outcry. 
<P>
But the provinces will have to agree to pay for the program. The
issue arose after a Quebec couple went to court to win the right
to donate blood for their son's surgery. 
<HR>

<H3>Booze Bust </H3>

<P>
RCMP say they have smashed a Canada wide alcohol and tobacco smuggling
ring. 
<P>
So far 170 people have been arrested with more expected. the raids
took place in Ontario, Quebec and BC. 
<P>
The mounties say five organized crime groups, including Asian
gangs, were involved in smuggling through the Akwesasne reserve
in eastern Ontario. 20 million dollars worth of alcohol, tobacco,
drugs and weapons have been seized. 
<HR>

<H3>French Ban </H3>

<P>
The families of Paul Bernardo's murder victims won't be allowed
to take part in a Supreme Court hearing on closed courtrooms.

<P>
The high court ruled the families could not help it decide on
when the media can be banned from reporting on cases. The CBC
will argue tomorrow that freedom of the press was violated when
a new Brunswick judge refused to make public the details of a
sex assault case against a Moncton politician. 
<HR>

<H3>Spy Deadline</H3>

<P>
A Reform MP has gone public with what she says is proof a Russian
agent infiltrated Canada's intelligence service. Val Meredith
released claims that a member of CSIS met secretly with Russian
spies and that CSIS brass, protected him.
<HR>

<H3>Freemen Standoff </H3>

<P>
An armed standoff is now, into its fifth day in Jordan, Montana.

<P>
US federal agents have surrounded a farm where a dozen or so people,
who refuse to acknowledge governmental authority, are holed up.
the so-called &quot;freemen&quot; are wanted for allegedly writing
bad cheques and threatening local officials.
<HR>

<H3>Hijackers Thursday </H3>

<P>
In Cairo, Canadian diplomats welcomed back 59 Canadian tourists
following a frightening journey that took them on an unscheduled
visit to Libya. 
<P>
The group was among 145 passengers aboard an Egypt-air jet, hijacked
yesterday. Three armed hijackers surrendered shortly after landing
in Libya.

<H3>Bomb Threat </H3>

<P>
Part of downtown Hamilton is shut down, following a bomb threat
in the cities downtown core. Staff and prisoners at the provincial
courthouse were evacuated around 10:30 this morning after a bomb
threat was called in. 
<HR>

<H3>Castillo Surrenders</H3>

<P>
In other news tonight, a former model wanted in a huge armored-car
heist has surrendered to police in Toronto. 
<P>
Police had been looking for a female suspect since last August's
holdup of a Loomis truck. 28 year old (ee-da) Catillo is the fifth
person charged. Among the others arrested is a Toronto police
officer. 
<HR>

<H3>OPSEU Wednesday </H3>

<P>
There has been a setback in the talks between the government and

<P>
Management Board chairman Dave Johnson says he is confused by
union tactics, and it may be another two weeks before an agreement
can be reached. 
<HR>

<H3>Hydro Rejects </H3>

<P>
Ontario Hydro workers have almost unanimously rejected the last
contract offer from the utility. 
<P>
Members of the Power Workers Union voted 98.5 percent against
the offer. Union President John Murphy calls the result an overwhelming
message to Hydro that its last offer was clearly unacceptable
to the membership. 
<P>
Contract talks broke off last month but will resume in early April.

<HR>

<H3>Teacher Cuts </H3>

<P>
The public school system in Hamilton is about to lose a rash of
energetic young teachers... those who enthusiastically share both
work-time and spare-time with their teen-aged charges. 
<P>
But despite their energy and dedication... they have received
lay-off notices. It is a system based on seniority... and they
simply don't have enough in this time of major cutbacks. Anthony
Pooley has a couple of their stories. 
<P>
<I>Who among us can say that during our school years we were not
moved in some positive way by at least one teacher? A teacher
like Glenn Cooke, perhaps, a high school science teacher at Delta
Secondary School. Once the layoffs announced by the school board
take effect, his particular teaching specialty will all but cease
to exist at Delta... but that's not all... who will the coaches
be next September? Who will coach gymnastics, as Corie Pillinini
does now? </I>
<P>
<I>This is a 12-hour day for the energetic, 28-year-old Geography
Department head at Delta. Once classes have concluded, she will
turn her attention to the school gymnastics team. </I>
<P>
<I>And for all of their hard work ... commitment to their profession
... commitment to the development of Hamilton's youth... their
reward comes one day in an envelope... a layoff notice. </I>
<P>
<I>Glenn Cooke and Corie Pillinini are only two examples of the
extent to which the system of education is being robbed... robbed
of the talented young professionals gifted in reaching out to
disillusioned teen-agers... robbed in the name of beleaguered
taxpayers who have told those they elect that they simply can't
afford to pay any more in taxes. Painful times, indeed. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Spy-Follow </H3>

<P>
The Solicitor General has ordered Canada's intelligence service
to explain allegations of a Russian spy inside the agency. 
<P>
Herb Gray has given CSIS documents which a reform MP says proves
a spy exists. The MP is threatening to make the documents public
in 24 hours.
<HR>

<H3>Anik </H3>

<P>
Telesat Canada, the crown agency that carries Canada's communications
satellites, says the Anik E-1 has lost half of its power... and
it may be lost forever. 
<P>
Experts maintain that a disconnected solar panel is to blame for
yesterday's satellite trouble which took several television stations
temporarily off the air and interrupted everything from computer
to pager systems. Service has been restored to most clients via
Anik E-2 but Telesat says its doubtful Anik E-1 can be fixed.

<HR>

<H3>Egypt Hijacking </H3>

<P>
Canada's Foreign Affairs department has confirmed the 59 Canadian
passengers aboard a hijacked Egypt-air jetliner... are safe. 
<P>
Earlier today, the hi-jackers commandeered the plane in Luxor,
Egypt and forced the pilot to fly to Libya where the plane eventually
landed. The hijackers demanded to meet with Libya's leader Moammar
Gadhafi before surrendering to authorities. 
<HR>

<H3>Assassin Sentence </H3>

<P>
In Israel today, has convicted Yigal Amir and sentenced him to
life in jail for the November murder of prime minister Yitzhak
Rabin. 
<HR>

<H3>Menendez Sentencing </H3>

<P>
The sentencing phase in the murder trial of Erik and Lyle Menendez
began today in Los Angeles. 
<P>
A California jury must decide if the brothers will spend the rest
of their lives in prison, or be put to death for killing their
parents. 
<P>
The defense is expected to call friends and family to testify
the two were sexually abused. Prosecutors say the young men killed
their parents, to inherit their fortune. 
<HR>

<H3>Spacewalk</H3>

<P>
NASA says two &quot;Atlantis&quot; astronauts accomplished all
their objectives in a six hour spacewalk today. It was the first
spacewalk by Americans outside Russia's space station &quot;Mir&quot;.

<P>
The two spacecraft have been linked since Saturday. They'll separate
tomorrow.

<H3>OHIP Hunger Strike</H3>

<P>
A Sudbury father has won his battle to have OHIP pay for his dying
daughters' life saving treatment, in an American hospital. But,
the man had to resort to drastic measures before OHIP officials
would change their mind. 
<HR>

<H3>Teen Surrenders </H3>

<P>
In Oakville, a young man, presumed drowned after he slipped into
a creek while running from police, has turned himself in. 
<P>
Police spent several hours last night searching the waters and
banks of 16 Mile Creek, looking for the 19 year old. But he apparently
was in the water only a short time, before pulling himself out.

<P>
He surrendered to police this afternoon. The man had been running
from police investigating three break-ins, when he jumped over
a steep embankment and into the water. 
<HR>

<H3>Jails-Essential </H3>

<P>
Queen's Park is on its way to court, seeking an order to compel
jail guards designated essential to work. This as guards refused
to show up at about half of the provincial jails. Anthony Pooley
has the details. 
<P>
<I>The Niagara Detention Centre in Thorold is just one of several
provincial jails where essential personnel are refusing to work
... some say it's just too dangerous without their striking colleagues
to bring staff up to an acceptable complement; others claim they're
not being paid. So management is staffing jails. </I>
<P>
<I>Queen's Park claims OPSEU is not honouring its essential services
agreement... although the Hamilton Wentworth Detention Centre
remains staffed with a skeleton unionized crew. But for his part,
Management Board Chairman Dave Johnson believes that ongoing contract
talks to end the public service strike should be separated and
distinct from the situation at the jails. </I>
<P>
<I>Although the government claims that half of the province's
49 jails are affected, the union claims essential workers are
failing to show up at only 11 of them. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton... Anthony Pooley... Channel 11 News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Harris-Fingerprints </H3>

<P>
Metro Toronto may soon become the only municipality in Canada,
to fingerprint welfare recipients. 
<P>
If metro council approves the move, people drawing welfare in
Toronto will be required to carry a bank card with an electronic
strip bearing a digitized reading of their fingerprint. 
<P>
Meanwhile the province of Ontario is also looking at bringing
in a similar province-wide ID card. But Premier Mike Harris says
there are still some concerns about privacy of information. 
<HR>

<H3>Derailment </H3>

<P>
It could take a couple of days to clear the wreckage from a CN
train derailment north of Orillia. 
<P>
13 cars left the tracks early today. About 60 people were evacuated
because some of the cars contained hazardous materials. They returned
home when it was found none were leaking. 
<HR>

<H3>Que. By-elections </H3>

<P>
One seat for the Bloc, none for Reform and five for the Liberals.
That sums up the outcome of the six federal by-elections yesterday
in Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland. 
<P>
Prime Minister Chretien's national unity strategy remains intact
with the election of rookie cabinet ministers Stephanie Dion and
Pierre Pettigrew in Montreal. And the Chretien government says
the results show that Canadians endorse its policies.
<HR>

<H3>Oscar Wrap </H3>

<P>
And from Ottawa to Los Angeles now, where the results of yet another
group of voters were announced. the 68th annual Academy Awards
were handed out last night and the big winner was the Scottish
epic &quot;Braveheart&quot;.

<H3>OPSEU - OFL Demo</H3>

<P>
At least 2-thousand members of the Ontario labor movement gathered
at Queens Park today to protest last Monday's tactics by the OPP
riot squad. The group is also demanding the resignation of Solicitor
General Bob Runciman. 
<HR>

<H3>By-elections </H3>

<P>
Canadians in six federal riding have their say today. Two by-elections
are being held in Newfoundland, three in Quebec and one here in
Ontario in the riding of Etobicoke. For the Liberals, the votes
are a test of their national unity strategy. 
<HR>

<H3>Quebec By-elections </H3>

<P>
In the Quebec races, the Bloc Quebecois is expected to hold onto
one. 
<P>
The others have been held by Liberals for decades. and top candidates
have been parachuted in making the challenge a little tougher
for all involved. 
<HR>

<H3>Mad Cow Update </H3>

<P>
Britain's government has decided against new action to protect
the public from &quot;mad cow disease&quot;. 
<P>
There are fears that the disease can lead to a fatal brain ailment
in humans, and about 20 countries have banned imports of British
beef. 
<P>
Today the European union joined the ban. For years, Canada has
banned beef imports from Britain and any other country that has
a problem with mad cow disease. 
<HR>

<H3>Oscar Advancer </H3>

<P>
Excitement, and crowds, are building in tinseltown for the Oscars

<H3>Harris-Latest</H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris says his government could stop spending cuts
at 8-billion dollars, and still end up with a balanced budget.

<P>
It is thought that points to a strong possibility that there won't
be any new spending reductions in the spring budget. 
<HR>

<H3>Org. Radio Ads </H3>

<P>
A right wing lobby group has launched a radio ad campaign in four
cities, designed to keep the Harris government's tax cut promise
on the front burner. 
<P>
Ontarians for Responsible Government is running the spot announcements
in Hamilton, as well as Toronto, London and Kitchener. Anthony
Pooley reports. 
<P>
<I>That is the gospel according to Ontarians for Responsible Government,
a right wing lobby group that regularly speaks out in support
of measures taken by the Harris government. </I>
<P>
<I>They're running radio ads in four Ontario cities, including
Toronto and Hamilton. And their view is clear. </I>
<P>
<I>But liberals generally and Hamilton East MPP Dominic Agostino
specifically are lining up to urge the governing Tories to abandon
their promise of a tax cut... suggesting that the pain of the
government spending cutbacks is simply too excruciating to bear.
</I>
<P>
<I>So as the polarization and the OPSEU strike continue... the
line-ups get longer on both sides of the battle line... while
bewildered taxpayers look on. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton ... Anthony Pooley... Channel 11 News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>GST</H3>

<P>
Finance Minister Paul Martin wants to talk to the provinces first,
and he won't comment on a report that Ottawa is close to harmonizing
provincial sales taxes with the GST in Atlantic Canada. 
<P>
Martin met with Newfoundland Premier Brian Tobin this morning
in St. Johns. While not denying the report, Martin says Tobin
has some concerns and that a lot of details still have to be worked
out. 
<P>
In Ottawa, the Reform Party attacked the government over the issue.
During question period, Reform MP Deborah Grey accused the liberals
of trying to buy votes in Monday's federal by-elections. 
<HR>

<H3>GM - Outsource </H3>

<P>
Seventeen thousand laid off General Motors workers in Canada will
begin heading back to work tomorrow. 
<P>
The strike in Dayton, Ohio which resulted in part shortages at
GM plants throughout North America has been resolved. 
<P>
But as Lauran Sabourin reports, although the strike is over, the
main issue that led to the dispute still hasn't been settled.

<P>
<I>An overwhelming acceptance vote in Dayton. But not necessarily
a victory for the union. </I>
<P>
<I>The issue is outsourcing. Having General Motors parts made
by outside companies. Outsourcing is the number one issue for
the Canadian auto workers. The number one issue at GM St. Catharines
plant. </I>
<P>
<I>St. Catharines will lose 750 jobs when its axle plant moves
to Buffalo. St. Catharines has lost 32 hundred jobs since 1989.
Another 15 hundred may disappear by September. And the union can
make no promises when it all will end.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Summer Weather</H3>

<P>
If you've just about had it with winter this year, you're not
alone. Although spring officially arrived in Canada two days ago,
many Canadians are still facing sub zero temperatures and snowfall.

<P>
It's been a long winter, and spring is definitely taking its sweet
time getting here.... but get ready to dust off those shades and
pull on those shorts because Environment Canada is predicting
a warmer summer than average.

<HR>

<H3>OPSEU Latest </H3>

<P>
A public inquiry into Monday's violent picket demonstration around
Queens Park, could begin in two weeks. That was the word from
Deputy Premier Ernie Eves today. 
<HR>

<H3>Court - Pensions </H3>

<P>
A group of former Stelco workers will get full pensions, the Supreme
Court of Canada has decided. 
<P>
The decision came today following a 5-year David versus Goliath
battle. And as Anthony Pooley reports tonight ... the former staffers
won the fight not only at the supreme court ... but at every other
level as well. 
<P>
<I>The big question was always whether Stelco's golden boot, given
to about 700 staffers about six years ago... was part of a corporate
re-organization ... and whether that number was significant enough
to warrant a partial pension plan wind-down to provide full pensions
for those who qualified at their normal retirement date.</I>
<P>
<I>Appearing before a tribunal 3 years ago, Stelco lawyer Mark
Frieman argued that the two criteria must be connected. Stelco
lost that round and several others... including their application
to appeal. That was thrown out today by the Supreme Court of Canada.
</I>
<P>
<I>Stelco did not make a statement today... but Frieman told us
that the next step in the process is compliance... staring with
the preparation of a wind down report for the pension commission.
All of that should pave the way for full pension benefits. </I>
<P>
<I>Ex-Stelco staffer Art Frewin led the charge on behalf of about
60 ex-staffers. He is understandably ecstatic over today's decision.
</I>
<P>
<I>But just as important as the victory of David over Goliath
is the precedent set by the decision and the general tone of various
rulings... that to the larger extent, pension law exists to protect
the pension rights of workers... not the rights of company shareholders...
and that the money in pension plans belongs to the workers...
not the corporation. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton... Anthony Pooley... Channel 11 News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Zundel - Court </H3>

<P>
Holocaust denier Ernst Zundel is fighting Ottawa's decision to
deny him Canadian citizenship. 
<P>
Zundel, who calls himself a model Canadian citizen, says he has
no criminal record and sees no reason why he should be labeled
a security risk by Canada's security intelligence review committee.

<P>
Today Zundel appeared before the Federal Court in Ottawa, claiming
the committee is biased and therefore in no position to judge
his eligibility to stay in this country. 
<HR>

<H3>Charest Deal </H3>

<P>
Conservative Leader Jean Charest lashed back at the Reform Party
for accusing him of making deals with separatists. 
<P>
The Reform Party says it has proof Charest forged an alliance
with the Bloc. The accusations are another symptom of by-election
fever. <P>

<H3>Public Inquiry </H3>

<P>
The Ontario government is willing to call a public inquiry into
the violent confrontation between police and strikers outside
the legislature. 
<P>
Deputy Premier Ernie Eves says he'll discuss the issue tomorrow,
with opposition house leaders. 
<P>
Several picketing civil servants were injured when a baton- wielding
provincial police riot squad stormed through a crowd of strikers.
The squad was brought in to help conservative members get to work.

<HR>

<H3>Johnson-Talks </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, there has been some movement in contract negotiations
between the government and its striking workers. 
<P>
The government is studying the latest proposal which includes
some concessions on the part of the union. Management Board Chairman
Dave Johnson, says there is still a long way to go, but the two
sides are slowly inching closer to a deal. 
<P>
Negotiators are meeting around the clock under a mediator -imposed
news blackout to resolve the strike, which is now into its fourth
week.
<HR>

<H3>House Picket </H3>

<P>
And while both sides struggle towards reaching some sort of compromise,
a Hamilton family is going through a personal hell because of
the strike. A new tactic employed by the union has struck too
close to home. 
<HR>

<H3>Workfare</H3>

<P>
Welfare recipients in Ontario could find themselves working on
community improvement projects beginning this spring. The move
is part of &quot;the Ontario Works Plan&quot;, a key promise during
the conservative government's election campaign last spring. 
<P>
About 1.2 million Ontarians are on welfare, roughly 10 percent
of the provincial population. 
<HR>

<H3>Menendez Verdict </H3>

<P>
A Los Angeles jury has convicted Erik and Lyle Menendez of killing
their parents. 
<P>
The first degree murder convictions mean both brothers are eligible
for the death penalty. 
<P>
The brothers claimed they killed their parents to end years of
abuse. The state said they killed to get their parents money.

<HR>

<H3>Shaw Preps</H3>

<P>
Well it may look like winter outside but spring has arrived and
that means the tourist season is also about to begin. 
<P>
In Niagara-on-the-Lake, the Shaw Festival is a flurry of activity
as the company prepares for the opening of its 35th season next
month.

<H3>Protest Inquiry </H3>

<P>
Opposition parties at Queens Park are demanding a public inquiry
into the way a provincial police riot squad handled a massive
rally at the Ontario Legislature yesterday. 
<P>
A few people were injured when the squad cleared the way for MPP's
to get into the building. OPSEU strikers and their supporters
were blocking the entrance to protest the lack of progress in
a strike that has now entered it's third week. 
<HR>

<H3>MPP's Pay Raise </H3>

<P>
Provincial politicians won't be getting a pay raise this year.
Premier Mike Harris says he'll personally guarantee it. 
<P>
A published report says MPP's would automatically get a five percent
pay hike when the social contract expires in April. 
<P>
Meanwhile, there's no deadline for the government's pledge to
overhaul politicians pay and gold trimmed pensions. 
<HR>

<H3>Public Housing Sale </H3>

<P>
A new report, compiled by members of Ontario's Public Housing
Authorities, is urging the Harris government to rethink its plans
for privatization. Such a decision, the report concludes, could
save money in the short term, but could have devastating effects
down the road. Annette Hamm explains. 
<P>
<I>Cathy Smith, her husband and three kids have lived in their
tidy east mountain home for the past twelve years. </I>
<P>
<I>Their rent is geared to income, about a quarter of their gross
pay. Since the Ontario government announced it wanted to get out
of the public housing business last year, Cathy has been fighting
to keep them in. </I>
<P>
<I>When Cathy and her family were living in private housing back
in the 1980's half of their income went towards rent. Housing
authorities across the province fear that could happen to many
more families if the government hands public housing to the private
sector. </I>
<P>
<I>A report compiled by housing groups across the province, calls
for changes to be made to the public housing system before moving
to privatization. They call for less red tape in decision making
and administration. </I>
<P>
<I>The public housing report has been approved by the Ontario
Housing Council, and is now in the hands of the ministry of housing.
</I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton, Annette Hamm, Channel 11 News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Human Rights</H3>

<P>
The Chretien government faces strong criticism from the Canadian
Human Rights Commission for delaying further protection for gays.

<P>
Human Rights Commissioner Max Yalden told parliament today the
delays amount to &quot;acquiescence in intolerance&quot;. He says
the delays make gays and lesbians the victims of special treatment
because they don't have the same rights as everybody else. 
<P>
Justice Minister Allan Rock says parliament will further protect
gays... one day. 
<HR>

<H3>Airport Update </H3>

<P>
A power failure at Toronto's Pearson Airport caused radar screens
to go blank in the air traffic control tower today. 
<P>
Airport spokesman Bruce Reid says they now have an alternate power
source, but the system is only working at 60 to 70 percent capacity.
Reid says they hope to have the system running at full speed by
tomorrow morning. 
<P>
Earlier today, some planes on their final approach had to be brought
down by controllers using their eyes and radios. Most other planes
were diverted to other airports. 
<HR>

<H3>Disco Fire </H3>

<P>
In international news, a disco fire in the Philippines is being
called the worst ever in that country's history. 
<P>
Firemen have removed the bodies of 150 people from the smoking
ruins. As many as 50 others are believed to be buried under the
debris. 
<HR>

<H3>Coma Rape Birth </H3>

<P>
Doctors in Rochester, New York, say a baby boy, born to a raped,
comatose woman, is now breathing on his own and will likely survive.

<P>
The baby was born yesterday, eight weeks premature, weighing just
two-pounds 11-ounces. His 29-year-old mother suffered head injuries
in a car accident more than 10 years ago, and was raped at a Rochester-area
nursing home. 
<P>
Doctors believe this to be the first case of someone getting pregnant
and giving birth while in a coma.

<H3>Queens Park Protest</H3>

<P>
A noisy demonstration at Queens Park turned violent today when
police and striking OPSEU workers clashed at the entrance of the
legislative building. 
<P>
Two people were taken to hospital after police used batons to
control the crowd of over a thousand. The protest was planned
around the opening of the spring session of the Ontario legislature.

<HR>

<H3>Krasowski-Liberals</H3>

<P>
A Liberal Party official from Niagara Falls has thrown his hat
into the ring for leader of the Liberals provincial party. 
<P>
Ted Krasowski, secretary of the Niagara Falls Provincial Liberal
Association, will seek the top job when the convention is held
in November. Krasowski is a statistician with a pharmaceutical
firm and is active in politics at both the federal and provincial
levels. 
<HR>

<H3>Karla Report </H3>

<P>
Convicted killer Karla Homolka will not face additional criminal
charges. That was the recommendation from Mr. Justice Patrick
Galligan... the judge who reviewed the controversial plea deal
made with Homolka. 
<P>
She was sentenced to a maximum of 12 years in prison in exchange
for testimony against her ex husband Paul Bernardo. Lauran Sabourin
has the story. 
<P>
<I>In his report Judge Galligan agreed with the decision not to
proceed with charges against Homolka in the sexual assault of
Jane Doe because it would have damaged her credibility on the
stand. And the jury might have returned a lesser charge against
Bernardo in that case. Even though Homolka failed to tell authorities
about the assault until after she signed her 12 year deal. And
she was serving her term in prison. The public was outraged. </I>
<P>
<I>Donna French, Kristen French's mother, wasn't happy with the
12 year deal either. She wanted a much longer sentence. Homolka's
father Karel said he expected the results in the review. Because
as he put it, his daughter followed the rules. </I>
<P>
<I>But Gwen Hunter, the Dundas woman who along with a group produced
a 320 thousand name petition, doesn't buy that. And she says the
petition won't stop here. </I>
<P>
<I>Homolka's sentence has caused public to seriously question
the plea bargaining system. But as donna French sees it, it's
a system in most cases that works. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Belleville Teen </H3>

<P>
The school attended by slain Belleville Ontario teenager, Mark
Fyke held a prayer service today to help students cope with their
grief. 
<P>
The 18 year old was shot and killed last week in Daytona Beach,
Florida, where he was spending March break. An 18 year old Florida
man turned himself in and is charged with first degree murder.

<HR>

<H3>Killer Guns</H3>

<P>
School is out for most of the week in Dunblane, Scotland as the
townspeople hold funerals for victims of a massacre. 
<P>
16 kindergarten children and a teacher were gunned down last week
by a shooter who then killed himself. 
<HR>

<H3>Salvi Verdict </H3>

<P>
A Massachusetts jury has convicted abortion clinic shooter John
Salvi on all counts. 
<P>
Salvi murdered two women and tried to kill five people in December
of 1994. The jurors rejected arguments that Salvi was insane when
he planned and carried out the attacks at clinics in the Boston
area. 
<HR>

<H3>Mandela Divorce </H3>

<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela has accused his estranged
wife, Winnie, of adultery. 
<P>
He was testifying at the start of their divorce proceedings. Mandela
told the court that when he left prison in 1990 after serving
27 years of a life sentence, he went to live with his wife in
Soweto but they experienced no real intimacy.

<H3>Baby Deaths? </H3>

<P>
A coroner's investigation says that as many as 150 babies who
died from apparent sudden infant death syndrome over the last
10 years, may actually have been victims of abuse. 
<P>
This today from Ontario deputy coroner Dr. Jim Cairns. And as
Anthony Pooley reports tonight... there is another syndrome which
is actually a form of abuse. 
<P>
<I>There are probably significantly more babies dying each year
from abuse than originally believe, says the Ontario Coroner's
Office after a lengthy investigation. In fact, Deputy Coroner
Dr. Jim Cairns, who did the review, believes that a number of
deaths originally attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or
SIDS may actually have been caused by abuse and even murder. </I>
<P>
<I>Of the 1400 or so deaths attributed to SIDS over the last 10
years, between 100 and 150 of them may well have been caused by
parental or other care-giver abuse. Those findings do not surprise
Hamilton pediatrician Dr. Shuba Wahi. infants... and signs of
infant abuse... are her particular specialty. </I>
<P>
<I>Indeed, there is another syndrome that kills babies... and
this one is decidedly abuse. It is called shaken baby syndrome...
and in some cases, the abuse is deliberate... in others it is
care giver ignorance that results in injury to infants. in any
case, a rigorous new protocol is designed to result in more accurate
pathological findings in the future. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton.... Anthony Pooley... Channel 11 News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Blood </H3>

<P>
The Canadian Red Cross says it's found another way to make Canada's
blood supply safer. 
<P>
Canada's blood collection agency has gained FDA approval to bring
in a new, more effective HIV test, that will be able to detect
the AIDS virus in its earliest stages... something current blood
testing has been unable to do. 
<P>
The Red Cross hopes its new testing procedures will help save
more lives, but there are some concerns about the cost, effectiveness
and potential misuse of the system. 
<HR>

<H3>Karla Report </H3>

<P>
A report on the Karla Homolka plea-bargain deal is to go to the
Ontario government today. 
<P>
In return for testimony against her ex-husband, Paul Bernardo,
Homolka was sentenced to 12 years for her role in the sex slayings
of two Ontario schoolgirls. Last November, Ontario's Attorney
General asked a judge to conduct an independent review of Homolka's
deal.
<HR>

<H3>Zundel </H3>

<P>
The Ontario government has dropped a charge of promoting hatred
that was filed against holocaust- denier Ernst Zundel. 
<P>
Lawyers for the Attorney General's ministry say there isn't enough
evidence to proceed. Holocaust survivor, Sabin (sit-run) who pressed
the charge, says the government didn't do enough in the case.

<HR>

<H3>Police Shooting</H3>

<P>
The special investigation unit has been called in after metro
Toronto police shot and killed a man who was pointing what appeared
to be a gun. 
<P>
The man, in his early 20s, was pronounced dead at hospital soon
after the shooting. The incident began when two officers answered
a call about a person at the rear of a shopping mall with a knife.
<HR>

<H3>OPSEU Scuffle </H3>

<P>
The Ontario government and its striking employees have agreed
to impose a news blackout on all contract talks. Both sides feel
more progress will be made by keeping the negotiations private.

<P>
And in another development today, tempers flared as a picket of
a land registry office in Toronto turned ugly. 
<HR>

<H3>Collenette</H3>

<P>
Defence Minister David Collenette is challenging Bloc Quebecois
MP Jean-Marc Jacob to prove his allegations. 
<P>
Jacob has said Ottawa looked into the formation of a Quebec army
in the event of separation. But Jacob says he has no proof. Collenette
assured the commons today that the military leadership authorized
no discussions about splitting the armed forces. 
<HR>

<H3>Commons-Language </H3>

<P>
Parliament has been exposed to some very unparliamentary language
from a Bloc MP. 
<P>
Yvon Loubier was heard to utter the &quot;f-word&quot; during
a heated exchange with the minister of Indian affairs. The outburst
caps a rowdy week in which the language of parliament was tinged
with blue.

<H3>Scotland Aftermath </H3>

<P>
Police in Dunblane, Scotland are trying to determine why Thomas
Hamilton killed 16 children and their teacher. 
<P>
When the shooting ended, Hamilton turned a gun on himself. Several
children were injured and at least one child is in critical condition.

<HR>

<H3>TV Violence </H3>

<P>
The federal broadcast regulator has handed down a television violence
policy using v-chip technology. Broadcasters and cable companies
must start to follow the new rules by this September. Anthony
Pooley has the details. 
<P>
<I>It is called the v-chip... a device designed to block certain
appropriately encoded t-v programming... notably that containing
gratuitous violence that experts believe can do permanent psychological
harm to children under 11. It is the cornerstone of the federal
broadcast regulator's t-v violence policy, unveiled today by CRTC
Chairman Keith Spicer. </I>
<P>
<I>Among other things, the policy compels broadcasters to encode
programs so that offensive ones can be blocked by the v-chip...
and it compels cable companies to offer v-chip devices for a low
monthly fee beginning in September. </I>
<P>
<I>The broadcast industry must come up with a violence rating
system. If American broadcasters haven't started encoding shows
by January, cable companies and the distributors of U.S. signals
will have to come up with an alternative method. </I>
<P>
<I>And the CRTC also wants to see broadcasters come up with more
top quality, non violent shows aimed at kids. </I>
<P>
<I>The CRTC conducted exhaustive public consultations last fall.
Today's policy announcement responds to the concerns raised in
those venues. </I>

<H3>OPSEU 10%</H3>

<P>
Striking civil servants are disputing government claims that five
thousand government workers are crossing the picket lines. 
<P>
The government is saying more and more public sector employees
are returning to work every day, despite the OPSEU strike which
has dragged on for 18-days. 
<P>
Management Board Chairman Dave Johnson says the longer the strike
goes on ..the more people cross the picket line. The union says
many of the 5-thousand members who have crossed the picket lines
are management. 
<HR>

<H3>TTC Strike </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, a strike could be brewing at the Toronto Transit Commission.

<P>
The city's unionized transit workers have voted 98 percent in
favor of rejecting the city's most recent contract offer. Their
collective agreement expires at the end of the month. 
<HR>

<H3>Quake Streeters </H3>

<P>
A mild earthquake rattled Montreal and Ottawa this morning, shaking
beds and spooking pets. But there were no injuries or damage.

<P>
The tremor measured 4.5 on the Richter scale and was centered
about 90 kilometres north of Montreal.<P>

<H3>Hydro Brownouts </H3>

<P>
Ontario is facing yet another labor dispute and this one could
lead to wide spread power shortages across the province. 
<P>
The 15 thousand unionized employees at Ontario Hydro could be
in a legal strike position by next month. In preparation, the
giant utility is making plans to shut down all of its nuclear
reactors. 
<HR>

<H3>OFL Labor Protest </H3>

<P>
The Ontario Federation of Labor has announced the next site for
a day of protest against the Harris government. It will stage
a protest in the Cambridge- Kitchener -Waterloo area on April
19th. 
<P>
This time around the OFL says it's campaign is aimed at employers
who favor the Harris government's agenda. Previous protests have
been staged in London and Hamilton. 
<HR>

<H3>OPSEU - Jails </H3>

<P>
As the province-wide strike by civil servants enters its third
week, negotiators for the Ontario government and OPSEU entered
their third day of mediation today. 
<P>
Despite repeated reports that rank-and-file support for the strike
is wavering, a number of picket lines actually bolstered their
numbers today. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>An early-morning show of strength by OPSEU members at Oakville's
Syl Apps Centre, home to high risk young offenders. Pickets blocked
managers from entering and leaving Syl Apps. Union members complain
essential workers are being forced to follow an illegal work schedule.
</I>
<P>
<I>At the Hamilton- Wentworth Regional Detention Centre, there's
no sign support for the strike is weakening, despite complaints
from inmates inside the jail that guards are taking their frustration
with the government out on prisoners. </I>
<P>
<I>A spokesman says the guards are buoyed by the fact mediators
continue to talk to government and OPSEU negotiators in Toronto.
In Hamilton, Deborah Walker, Channel Eleven News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>QP &amp; TTC Pickets </H3>

<P>
The Ontario government is seeking an injunction to keep open a
pedestrian tunnel in Toronto that its striking workers have dubbed
&quot;scab alley&quot;. It's not clear when a ruling will be made.

<P>
For the last two mornings, OPSEU and supporters from other unions
have blocked the entrance to the tunnel, which leads from the
subway to the legislature and other government buildings. They
say the tunnel allows workers to avoid picket lines. The union
members want it closed until the strike is over. 
<HR>

<H3>Russian Roulette</H3>

<P>
An 18 year old Mississauga man has died in hospital after playing
a game of Russian roulette. 
<P>
Peel Regional Police say three friends were in the basement of

<P>
The Ontario Federation of Labor has announced the next site for
a day of protest against the Harris government. It will stage
a protest in the Cambridge- Kitchener -Waterloo area on April

who favor the Harris government's agenda. Previous protests have
been staged in London and Hamilton. 
<HR>

<H3>OPSEU - Jails </H3>

<P>
As the province-wide strike by civil servants enters its third
week, negotiators for the Ontario government and OPSEU entered
their third day of mediation today. 
<P>
Despite repeated reports that rank-and-file support for the strike
is wavering, a number of picket lines actually bolstered their
numbers today. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>An early-morning show of strength by OPSEU members at Oakville's
Syl Apps Centre, home to high risk young offenders. Pickets blocked
managers from entering and leaving Syl Apps. Union members complain
essential workers are being forced to follow an illegal work schedule.
</I>
<P>
<I>At the Hamilton- Wentworth Regional Detention Centre, there's
no sign support for the strike is weakening, despite complaints
from inmates inside the jail that guards are taking their frustration
with the government out on prisoners. </I>
<P>
<I>A spokesman says the guards are buoyed by the fact mediators
continue to talk to government and OPSEU negotiators in Toronto.
In Hamilton, Deborah Walker, Channel Eleven News. </I>

<H3>QP &amp; TTC Pickets </H3>

<P>
The Ontario government is seeking an injunction to keep open a
pedestrian tunnel in Toronto that its striking workers have dubbed
&quot;scab alley&quot;. It's not clear when a ruling will be made.

<P>
For the last two mornings, OPSEU and supporters from other unions
have blocked the entrance to the tunnel, which leads from the
subway to the legislature and other government buildings. They
say the tunnel allows workers to avoid picket lines. The union
members want it closed until the strike is over. 
<HR>

An 18 year old Mississauga man has died in hospital after playing
a game of Russian roulette.

<H3>OPSEU Talks</H3>

<P>
There has been a break in the provincial government workers strike.
The two sides will go back to the bargaining table on Sunday.

<HR>

<H3>Canhotto-Sentencing</H3>

<P>
The OPSEU strike is being blamed for a delay in the sentencing
of two Cambridge residents in the manslaughter death of two-year-old
Kira Canhotto. 
<P>
The girl's mother, 24-year-old Maria Canhotto, and 57-year-old
neighbor Daniel Aguiar were to have been sentenced in the exorcism
case today. But the OPSEU strike has prevented the completion
of pre-sentencing reports. 
<P>
The judge has adjourned the sentencing to April 12th. 
<HR>

<H3>TTC Inquest</H3>

<P>
A coroner's jury has recommended that an outside agency review
safety in the Toronto Transit Commission. 
<P>
The jury released 18 recommendations today into the subway crash
last August 11th which killed three people. The jury feels the
TTC, the Metro Toronto and Ontario governments should review the
legislation affecting all railway operations in the province,
particularly relating to subways. And that the subways safety
system should be reviewed every two years... the jury also says
Metro Toronto and the Ontario government must commit to proper
funding of the TTC. 
<P>
The jury feels under-funding of the TTC since the 1980's has jeopardized
safety. 
<HR>

<H3>Toronto Murder #12 </H3>

<P>
Metro Toronto police are asking the intended victim of yesterday's
fatal shooting in York to come forward ... police say a young
gunman jumped out of a car and began firing wildly at someone
walking along the sidewalk... but police say the gunman missed
the intended victim and instead shot a thirty one year old woman
carrying a baby .
<P>
Her ten year old son was by her side. 31-year-old Linda Delellis
died a short while later in hospital. Investigators want the man
they believe was the target of the shooting to come forward and
identify the killer if possible.
<HR>

<H3>Women's Day </H3>

<P>
International Women's Day was celebrated across the country today
in different ways. 
<P>
In Toronto, it was a number of demonstrations, including one incident
of civil disobedience. The intersection of King and Bay in downtown
Toronto, the heart of Canada's business section was blocked by
dozens of women demonstrating against cuts by the Harris government.
They staged a sit-in, in the middle of the street, blocking streetcars
and other traffic . 
<P>
After five minutes, police moved in and arrested those who refused
to move. Police say they will be charged with mischief. 
<HR>

<H3>March Break Travel </H3>

<P>
March madness is on. Not the US. basketball tournament: the Canadian
version. The last minute dash out of winter's grasp, and into
the sun. Scot Urquhart reports... 
<P>
<I>It's one of the busiest travel times of the year in Canada
... march break. </I>
<P>
<I>12 thousand passengers went through Pearson Airport today ...
thousands more headed down the road ... to the US. border ...
</I>
<P>
<I>And this is what they are heading for: cold weather and cold
economy.... travel agents are busy, and Canadians are fed up.
</I>
<P>
<I>Dave Hunter wrote the book on traveling south; literally ...
he says if you want to avoid the crowds on the i-75 ... don't
stick to your usual schedule: time shift your lunch too. Two o'clock
is good ... and you'll miss most of the crowds. </I>
<P>
<I>And if you want to save on gas ... Hunter says don't fill up
at night, fill up in the morning, when gas is cooler and more
dense. </I>
<P>
<I>And when you finally reach your little piece of paradise; remember
the cardinal rule: don't look like a tourist: don't leave valuables
where thieves can see them in a rental car. If you do... you probably
wont, be bringing them home. Don't flash money around ... and
don't wander around in areas off the beaten path especially after
dark. </I>
<P>
<I>And one final tip if you're driving home at the end of march
break ... the i-75 will be closed in Toledo ... take the 475 by-pass
to stern road ... and then head east... back to the highway. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton Scot Urquhart, Channel Eleven News.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Unemployment Rate </H3>

<P>
Some good news on the economic front as Canadians digest the contents
of the budget. 
<P>
There was more solid job growth in February, but the overall unemployment
rate stayed put at 9.6 per cent. 
<P>
Statistics Canada said employment grew by 44,000 jobs during the
month, well over half of them full-time. 
<P>
In the golden horseshoe the unemployment rate rose slightly in
Toronto, Hamilton and the Niagara area.
<P>
Meanwhile, the American economy produced 705-thousand jobs last
month, cutting the US jobless rate to 5.5 per cent. Analysts had
expected about 300-thousand new jobs. 
<HR>

<H3>Leasing Clip </H3>

<P>
There's a report that Ottawa is going to allow the banks into
the car leasing business and that has car dealers fuming... the
leasing of cars and other small home appliances is a growth business.
And many are asking if the cash rich banks really need any more
money... but analysts say its the wave of the future. 
<HR>

<H3>GM Plants </H3>

<P>
A strike at two General Motors brake plants in Dayton, Ohio has
idled some of the company's assembly plants here in Ontario. The
two car plants in Oshawa, and another in Delaware have been forced
to cease production today. 
<P>
As many as 65-hundred workers in Oshawa have been told not to
report to work until further notice. The Ohio strike is into its
fourth day. 
<HR>

<H3>Hamas House</H3>

<P>
Israel and the Palestinians teamed up to take further punitive
steps against Islamic militants ... a top Hamas official was arrested...
and a Palestinian house in the West Bank was dynamited by Israeli
forces... 
<P>
The house belonged to the suicide bomber responsible for last
Sunday's attack that killed eighteen people. Four suicide bombings
have killed sixty one Israelis in the last few weeks. 
<HR>

<H3>Terror Summit </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile Prime Minister Jean Chretien will be attending next
week's summit on terrorism in Egypt. 
<P>
President Clinton and Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak will be
co-chairmen of the conference on fighting the threat terrorism
has on the mid-east peace process. 
<P>
The summit follows the four suicide bombings in Israel since February
25th that have killed a total of 61 people. 
<HR>

<H3>Seal Video Charges </H3>

<P>
Four Newfoundlanders who are seen on an amateur video have been
charged with breaking the seal hunt laws. 
<P>
The video was used in an anti-sealing campaign by the British-based
International Fund for Animal Welfare. The charges against the
four, who are from petty Harbour, include the illegal use of a
rifle and a gaff to hunt seals.

<H3>OPSEU Day 11</H3>

<P>
Inmates rioted at Toronto's Don Jail today. And striking jail
guards had to be called inside to quell the disturbance. 
<HR>

<H3>School Cuts Follow</H3>

<P>
High school students from throughout Halton region converged at
school board headquarters in Burlington today to protest massive
layoffs of teachers and support staff. 
<P>
All of this on the heels of the release of the so-called tool
kit from Queen's Park... that was supposed to have been a help
in managing the cuts. Anthony Pooley has the details. 
<P>
<I>These students protested loudly today... fearing that their
education is at risk. And their fears are well- founded. </I>
<P>
<I>The Halton Board of Education recently sent out 1500 layoff
notices... trying to come to terms with massive cutbacks in education
funding from Queen's Park. </I>
<P>
<I>Yesterday, Education Minister John Snobelen unveiled a so-called
tool kit that was expected to help boards deal with the cuts...
but Halton Board chair Linda Glover says nothing in it will enable
trustees to back- pedal on the announced cuts. </I>
<P>
<I>Back outside... not all of the students are in agreement...
and a handful who support the tough measures are chastised by
their peers for their opposing point of view. </I>
<P>
<I>At OSSTF District 8 Headquarters in Hamilton meanwhile, there
is tension in the air. </I>
<P>
<I>Back at the protest in Burlington, student organizers were
able to speak with Premier Mike Harris over the phone. They also
met briefly with school board officials... but the tough medicine
remains just as difficult to swallow. In Burlington... Anthony
Pooley... Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Budget Follow</H3>

<P>
The budget is out, now the selling begins. The head of the Treasury
Board now says federal government workers could be in for their
first raise in six years. 
<P>
Marcel Masse says he is lifting the wage freeze because there
is light at the end of the government's deficit tunnel. 
<HR>

<H3>Politics - Budget </H3>

<P>
The absence of deep spending cuts in yesterday's federal budget
has political pundits wondering what the Liberals are trying to
do. 
<P>
Some suspect it means an election may not be too far off. Others
think the Chretien government is just reacting to the national
mood. 
<HR>

<H3>Killer Bags </H3>

<P>
The US government is taking a second look at airbags in cars,
after a number of them actually killed people they're designed
to save in a crash.

<H3>Locals - Budget </H3>

<P>
Call it deficit reduction without tears or taxes. Finance Minister
Paul Martin delivered a good news budget today that adds muscle
to his deficit fighting strategy with minimal sting for ordinary
Canadians. 
<HR>

<H3>Tool Kit </H3>

<P>
In other news tonight, Education Minister John Snobelen has unveiled
his long promised &quot;tool kit&quot; to help Ontario school
boards deal with deep spending cuts. 
<P>
The province will delay construction of new schools for at least
a year and will look into hiring non-teachers as counselors and
librarians to help school boards save money. Legislation will
also be introduced to allow boards to negotiate the number of
sick days teachers get. 
<HR>

<H3>Casket Store </H3>

<P>
It's already accepted in the United States and most of Europe,
and now shopping for a casket outside of a funeral home has begun
here in Canada. 
<P>
Two Burlington brothers have just opened up &quot;The Casket Store&quot;,
trying to make a departure from traditional funeral arrangements.
Annette Hamm paid them a visit. 
<P>
<I>Alex Carey and his brother Stan want to make shopping for the
last thing you'll need on earth a bit like shopping for a piece
of furniture. They've opened a showroom on Burlington's Harvester
Road as a lower cost alternative to buying a casket in a funeral
home. </I>
<P>
<I>In many cases, Carey says caskets here cost fifty per cent
less because their overhead is lower. Like a retail store, they'll
deliver what you buy when you need it. </I>
<P>
<I>Most of their clients so far are families who know a death
is imminent. </I>
<P>
<I>Knowing people may be a little afraid of the product at first,
Alex encourages them to take a hands on approach. He wants customers
to feel the fabric they or their loved ones will rest in. He encourages
you to pull on the handles or lift the lid. </I>
<P>
<I>Eventually, the Carey brothers want to expand into floral arrangements
and monuments, making their store a one stop shop for funeral
products. </I>

<H3>OPSEU - QP </H3>

<P>
Most of southern Ontario is still digging out from the latest
winter storm. And the strike by provincial civil servants hasn't
help matters any. 
<P>
<I>The storm that swept across the southern and central parts
of Ontario, dumping anywhere from ten to fifteen centimetres of
snow.. closed schools, stopped school buses and brought morning
rush hour to a virtual standstill in most communities. </I>
<P>
<I>The Ministry of Transportation says 250 snow plows and sander
trucks were called into service. That's about a hundred fewer
than usual. </I>
<P>
<I>Management Board chairman Dave Johnson says the government
and the striking civil service union have agreed to do more to
keep the province's highways clear. Transportation Minister Al
Palladini says in some areas the plows are not getting out fast
enough. He says safety is his main concern. </I>
<P>
<I>Meanwhile, a business lobby group called Ontarians for Responsible
Government says its time to end OPSEU's monopoly on snowplowing.
Its calling on the Harris government to pass legislation immediately
that would allow for contracting out of snow plowing services.
</I>
<P>
<I>Cabinet ministers had to run the gauntlet to get inside the
legislature building today.. and had to put up with some vitriolic
comments from government workers. </I>
<P>
<I>Another group of protesters in the shadow of the snow shrouded
parliament buildings.. carried placards to show the public how
many services are being affected by the strike. The union is still
upset about some government workers who sneak through an underground
tunnel to get to work. In Toronto, Bob Ireland, Channel 11 News.
</I>
<HR>

<H3>Ont. Resp. Gov. </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, a group called Ontarians for Responsible Government,
wants snowplowing contracted out. It says the government should
immediately pass legislation to allow private contractors to sand,
salt and plow the roads. 
<P>
The organization says it's time to end the union monopoly on highway
snowplowing. Adding, it's intolerable that motorists should have
to risk their safety driving on dangerous highways. 
<HR>

<H3>Snobelen-Cuts </H3>

<P>
The Peel Board of Education has handed out about 500 layoff notices
to teachers and teaching assistants. 
<P>
The Peel board is just one of many across the province, firing
teachers to deal with government cuts. In light of the layoffs,
Education Minister John Snobelen says he doesn't want to see larger
class sizes. The education minister is expected to announce the
long awaited tool-kit this week, to help school boards cut some
400-million dollars from their budgets. 
<HR>

<H3>Brantford VON </H3>

<P>
And provincial cutbacks, and the changing needs of clients, have
forced the Victorian Order of Nurses to radically restructure
home care service it provides in Brant and Haldimand- Norfolk.
And the changes could have a profound impact on both the pay,
and the hours worked by the nearly 300 home-makers currently employed
by the VON.  Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>The Brant-Norfolk- Haldimand branch of the Victorian Order
of Nurses is contracted by the provincially- funded home care
agency to provide everything from personal care to light house-keeping
duties for home care clients. </I>
<P>
<I>Right now the VON's 280 visiting homemakers are mostly casual
employees, who work at their own convenience. But changing home
care eligibility rules, and client needs, have forced the VON
to shift the hours of its home-making workforce. Home-makers have
also been invited to work in three new VON programs, but for twenty
to thirty per cent less pay. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Budget Advance </H3>

<P>
Finance Minister Paul Martin says the deficit's back is broken,
but tomorrow's budget is too soon for tax relief. 
<P>
Martin says the annual deficit, as a percentage of the country's
total production, has dropped from six percent in 1993 to four
percent or better this year. And he predicts the government will
hit it's two percent target for 1998. 
<P>
Martin says the government would like to reduce taxes, but the
higher priority is preserving social programs ... however reform
leader Preston Manning is calling that a feeble excuse. 
<HR>

<H3>Child Support</H3>

<P>
The federal government is said to be on the verge of announcing
a major overhaul to Canada's child support system .... parts of
which may be introduced in tomorrow's budget. 
<P>
The Globe and Mail claims Ottawa is planning to scrap the requirement
that divorced parents, receiving child support, pay taxes on that
money. The reforms could also see non custodial parents, in most
cases, men, being unable to claim their payments as a tax deduction.

<HR>

<H3>Israel Follow </H3>

<P>
The military wing of the militant Islamic group Hamas is promising
to stop its attacks on Israelis. But it's not clear if the pledge
will end the recent wave of suicide bombing in Israel. Responsibility
for most of those attacks was claimed by what appear to be Hamas
renegades determined to go on with the violence.

<H3>Strike -Scabs</H3>

<P>
There was more unrest at the province's jails on this, day eight
of the OPSEU strike. 
<P>
The union says prisoners at Toronto's Don Jail plugged toilets
and lit fires after they were let out of their cells en masse.
And at the Hamilton jail, a hunger strike by 12 female inmates
is slowly spreading to the male population. 
<P>
Last week, in an attempt to quell problems at the Hamilton jail,
the labor relations board issued an order that would prevent no
more than one third of inmates out of their cells at any one time.
But the Solicitor General says, despite the growing unrest, the
government opposes extending that ruling to all jails.
<HR>

<H3>Barrie Snow </H3>

<P>
And the government is threatening to ask the Ontario Labor Relations
Board to order OPSEU to comply with an essential services agreement
on &quot;clearing roads&quot;. 
<P>
Yesterday, one person suffered a heart attack following a 38-vehicle
pileup on highway 400 north of Barrie. It was the second major
highway chain-reaction collision since the OPSEU strike began.

<P>
Police complain ministry snowplows failed to respond to their
calls until after 7 a.m. yesterday. That has Transportation Minister
Al Palladini angry. Under the essential services a agreement,
plows don't have to go out until 12 centimeters of snow has fallen.
<HR>

<H3>Cuts - New Jobs? </H3>

<P>
Will everyone in Ontario soon be unemployed? It might seem that
way when you see the stories of layoffs and jobs cuts, almost
everywhere you turn. 
<P>
13-thousand public sector jobs are on the line, when it seems
the economy is already in rough shape ... how will we ever survive
that kind of a hit? Well according to some economic analysts,
things may not be as bad as they seem: 
<P>
<I>Thirteen thousand of these civil servants will lose their jobs
soon ... as the provincial government cuts back. It seems that
everyone knows someone, who is out of work ... why then ... are
the unemployment and welfare numbers so good? </I>
<P>
<I>At the end of January ... Hamilton had the lowest unemployment
rate in the country ... below seven percent. Ontario as a whole
... was below nine percent .... and while both numbers were up
... the increase was virtually negligible. </I>
<P>
<I>At the same time ... the welfare roles were going down ...
in part due to changes in the system; but no matter how you look
at it, the numbers don't jibe ... with the job cuts we're hearing
about. </I>
<P>
<I>Alan Harrison is the chairman of economics at McMaster University
... he says things are not as bad as they seem ... and in fact,
the economy is actually growing.</I>
<P>
<I>Nick Catalano agrees. He is the Director for Economic Development
in Hamilton Wentworth. He says big jobs losses are being offset
by small companies who are adding staff a dozen or two at a time:
and so, will the loss of 13 thousand jobs cripple an already fragile
economy? it may be too early to tell.</I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton Scot Urquhart Channel Eleven News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Suicide Bombings</H3>

<P>
The Israeli cabinet is meeting in emergency session to discuss
how to deal with a Hamas campaign of terror. 
<P>
A day after Israel declared war on the militant Islamic organization,
a bomb exploded in a Tel Aviv shopping district. 12 people, including
the suicide bomber, are confirmed dead. 
<HR>

<H3>Campaign 96</H3>

<P>
U.S. Senator Bob Dole has won the endorsement of house speaker
Newt Gingrich in the race for the Republican Presidential Nomination.
Dole was in Buffalo today garnering support for tomorrow's super
Tuesday primaries.

<H3>Jails-Labour Bd. </H3>

<P>
On day five of the Ontario public service strike, the union cranked
up the pressure to a media audience, while there were signs that
the solidarity of some jail guards is beginning to weaken. 
<HR>

<H3>Barrie Riot </H3>

<P>
And still with the OPSEU strike, part of the Barrie Jail was evacuated
today after inmates started a fire. 
<P>
A spokesman says a number of inmates lit bedding on fire and threw
it out of the cell area. A corrections service riot squad was
called in to quell the disturbance... minimal damage was reported
and the situation is now under control. 
<HR>

<H3>Workfare</H3>

<P>
Social Services Minister David Tsubouchi says plans for workfare
are on schedule, and he has no intention of leaving community
groups out of the loop. 
<P>
This today in response to a published report suggesting that municipalities
would take on the task of getting those on welfare to do community
work in exchange for their cheques. Anthony Pooley has the details.

<P>
<I>&quot;Workfare&quot;... it's the notion that those who receive
social assistance do community work in return for their welfare
cheques ... and while they do it, they're developing skills that
can be parlayed into a salaried job somewhere. </I>
<P>
<I>Social Services Minister David Tsubouchi says that his ministry
has been meeting with community groups... and they will be in
the loop once the final plans are unveiled. </I>
<P>
<I>As to the notion that such an undertaking might replace other
workers... indeed, Hamilton- Wentworth's Social Services Chairman
wants local consultation ... something the minister says will
soon happen through local MPP's. </I>
<P>
<I>Ted McMeekin says he's not in favour of simply setting up hoops
for those collecting welfare... but... still, the minister is
playing his cards close to the vest in terms of specific plans,
saying only that they're right on target. McMeekin is frustrated
by the lack of specifics.</I>
<P>
<I>In Waterdown... Anthony Pooley... Channel 11 News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>RCMP Officer Shot </H3>

<P>
Police in Sault Ste. Marie report no arrests in the wounding of
an RCMP officer who was grazed by a bullet as he left work early
today. Two shots were fired at the officer as he was getting into
a car. 
<HR>

<H3>Terrorist </H3>

<P>
Solicitor General Herb Gray has ordered an RCMP report on how
a convicted Irish terrorist received security clearance to work
on renovation of the parliament buildings. 
<P>
Malachy McAllister had been convicted of attempting to kill a
police officer and was ordered deported from Canada two years
ago. The Reform Party calls the situation a shocking blow to the
safety and security of Canadians. 
<HR>

<H3>Peru </H3>

<P>
The Canadian embassy in Lima, Peru says there were no Canadians
aboard a Faucett airlines plane that crashed into the Andes mountains.
Early reports from the airline had indicated two Canadians were
among the 123 casualties. 
<P>
The embassy in Lima says the plane tickets may have been purchased
here but no Canadian citizens were aboard the flight. The Boeing
7-37 apparently caught fire in flight and slammed into a hillside
in southern Peru. 
<HR>

<H3>Menendez </H3>

<P>
For the second time, the fate of Erik and Lyle Menendez is in
the hands of a jury. 
<P>
A Los Angeles panel began deliberations today in the highly publicized
murder case. The brothers are being retried for the 1989 shotgun
killings of their parents. Their first trials ended in hung juries.

<P>
The defence says the Menendez brothers had been sexually abused
and killed out of fear for their lives. The prosecution says they
killed to inherit their parents multi-million dollar estate. 
<HR>

<H3>Kevorkian </H3>

<P>
Dr. Jack Kevorkian says he sometimes cries after attending suicides.
Kevorkian has taken the stand in his assisted suicide trial in
Pontiac, Michigan. Kevorkian told the jury he feels obligated
to help who are suffering. 
<HR>

<H3>Blank Twoonie </H3>

<P>
Chalk up another one against the Royal Canadian mint. 
<P>
A Hamilton couple aren't sure what their new two dollar coin is
worth ... because it's blank. Steve Gratoni picked up the coin
at a CIBC branch in north Hamilton this morning, and when he brought
it back home his wife Doris noticed there was no polar bear, no
queen and no engraving on the coin. <I> </I>

<H3>Jail Negotiations </H3>

<P>
The Ontario government is seeking a court order to ensure striking
jail guards abide by an essential services agreement. 
<P>
The Ontario Labor Relations Board has given OPSEU and the government
a deadline of tomorrow morning to make a deal on staffing levels
at jails during the civil service strike. But the government wants
the court order as insurance. 
<HR>

<H3>RRSP Deadline </H3>

<P>
An annual ritual continues at this hour in financial institutions
and brokerages everywhere. The ritual is last minute RRSP investors
busy sheltering money from the taxman in a number of ways. But
as Anthony Pooley reports tonight... one way is more popular than
the others this year. 
<P>
<I>The deadline for sheltering a little money from the much maligned
taxman is upon us ... and with that comes the usual last minute
line-ups. </I>
<P>
<I>Financial advisors, brokers and institutions will be burning
the midnight oil to get RSP's in before the clock strikes twelve.
</I>
<P>
<I>The number of Canadians saving extra money for retirement rises
each year... and the reason for it may be in the results of an
Angus Reid poll released today. It reveals that only 61 percent
of respondents believe that the Canada Pension Plan will play
a significant role in their retirement income. And faith in CPP
diminishes as the survey sample gets younger. In Hamilton... Anthony
Pooley... Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Jordan Verdict </H3>

<P>
The man accused of killing Michael Jordan's father has been found
guilty of first degree murder. 
<P>
James Jordan was killed as he napped in his car along a north
Carolina roadside in 1993. 
<P>
Late this afternoon, 21 year old Daniel Green was found guilty
of first degree murder, first degree robbery and conspiracy. He
could face the death penalty. 
<HR>

<H3>School Bus Shooting </H3>

<P>
Doctors in St. Louis are trying to save a baby after the teenage
mother was shot and killed on a school bus. 
<P>
Police say a teenage gunman wounded the driver and then began
firing at the bus. Two bullets killed the pregnant 15 year old.
The baby is in critical condition.
<HR>

<H3>F. Lee Bailey </H3>

<P>
A federal judge in Florida has ordered attorney F. Lee Bailey
to begin serving a six month jail term for contempt of court.

<P>
The sentence was handed down a short time ago when Bailey failed
to turn over millions of dollars in cash and stock. Bailey says
the money is his as payment from a convicted drug trafficker he
represented. His attorneys are expected to appeal. 
<HR>

<H3>New Rating </H3>

<P>
50 years from now, people may wonder how there ever could have
been t-v programs without ratings. 
<P>
American TV network executives met in Washington today to discuss
their pledge to begin rating programs for sexual and violent content.

<HR>

<H3>Grammy Winners </H3>

<P>
What a night for Canadians at the 38th annual Grammy awards. Superstar
Alanis Morrissette walked off with four awards. Joni Mitchell
won a pair of statues, and country singer Shania Twain, of Timmins
picked up an award for best country album. Kathy Renwald reports.

<P>
<I>Morrissette performed a melancholy and uncensored version of
her winning hit &quot;You Ought to Know&quot; and moments after
went to collect her Grammy for best rock song. Morrissette and
her American producer also won best rock album award for &quot;Jagged
Little Pill&quot;. Morrissette also won best rock vocal for &quot;You
Ought to Know&quot;. </I>
<P>
<I>Shania Twain of Timmins and her producer husband Robert Lange
won the best country album Grammy for &quot;The Woman in Me&quot;.
Twain beat Trisha Yearwood and Dwight Yokum among others in the
category. </I>
<P>
<I>And a Canadian with a legacy of carefully crafted music...
won for best pop album of the year.. Joni Mitchell collected the
honors for &quot;Turbulent Indigo&quot;, beating the music machine
muscle behind Madonna and Mariah Carey.</I>
<P>
<I>Other Canadians to collect Grammy awards.. jazz musician Rob
McConnell ..for a recording with Mel Torme. The luck of St. Catharines
polka king Walter Ostanek ran out last night... he lost in the
best polka album category. </I>
<P>
<I>The thank you speeches were generally tame ..but Bobby McFerrin
lectured teachers on the importance of music in the classroom.
</I>
<P>
<I>Jazz great Dave Brubeck was honored with a lifetime achievement
award song of the year honors went to Seal for &quot;Kiss From
a Rose&quot;.... and all in all a good night for Canadians with
Alanis Morrissette winning four major Grammies. </I>

<H3>London Pileup</H3>

<P>
At least one person was killed in a huge chain reaction pile-up
on highway 401 near London this morning. 
<P>
As many as 15 ambulances were called to the scene after 30 cars
and trucks slammed into each other on the slippery highway. Witnesses
call the accident scene a mangled mess, with some cars going into
the ditch and others into nearby fields. 
<P>
The crash is being blamed on extremely slippery conditions after
London was hit by a sudden snowfall this morning. 
<P>
Although the accident comes on the third day of a province-wide
strike by civil servants that has affected snow removal operations,
OPSEU president Leah Casselman says when the storm hit, workers
came off the picket line to run salters and sanders. 
<HR>

<H3>OPSEU Day Three </H3>

<P>
And while the strike may not have caused the horrible pile-up
on the 401, it is causing problems at provincial jails and detention
centers across the province. 
<HR>

<H3>Inspectors-Court </H3>

<P>
Other casualties of the OPSEU strike are the 300 meat processing
plants across the province that rely on provincial inspectors
to operate.... plants that could go out of business before this
dispute is resolved. Lauran Sabourin has more in this report.

<P>
<I>L &amp; V Poultry in Beamsville normally slaughters and packs
80 thousand birds a week. But this week a processing line is idle.
The loading dock empty. </I>
<P>
<I>Today the company began operating with a skeleton staff. The
chickens on this line, chickens that L &amp; V were contracted
to buy from poultry producers were slaughtered and killed by a
larger processing company. A company that has federal inspectors
on staff. an additional cost to the company that it says it can't
afford. But it can't afford to lose customers either. </I>
<P>
<I>Three poultry inspectors work at L &amp; V ...inspectors that
are now on the picket line. Predictions are that the strike will
last about three months. L &amp; V managers says under these conditions
they will be lucky to last three weeks. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Ontario Hydro</H3>

<P>
And still more labor trouble could be brewing in the province.
Talks have broken off between Ontario Hydro and the power workers
union. 
<P>
The current contract expires march 31st, and the two sides, which
have been meeting since December, appear to be miles apart. 
<HR>

<H3>Tories Poll </H3>

<P>
And despite all the labour unrest across the province, a new poll
suggests the Harris conservatives are holding their lead in party
popularity. 
<P>
The survey by Angus Reid-Southam News suggests the Tories have
the support of 46 percent of decided voters. That puts them just
slightly ahead of their share of the popular vote in last June's
election. 
<P>
The poll gives the opposition Liberals 36 percent support, with
the NDP coming in with 15 percent support. 
<HR>

<H3>Liberal Mood </H3>

<P>
With the government's throne speech now out of the way, prime
minister Chretien had some time to do a little bit of parliamentary
house cleaning today. 
<P>
Chretien helped swear in 25 new parliamentary secretaries this
morning. The old team of the so called &quot;ministers in training&quot;
was fired last week. 
<P>
Some backbench Liberal MP's are calling the process unfair, claiming
the decision may even force them to retaliate against their own
government by voting against upcoming bills. 
<HR>

<H3>Windermere Burns </H3>

<P>
One of the &quot;grand old ladies&quot; of Muskoka has been lost.
Windermere house, an historic posh resort on lake Rosseau, was
destroyed by fire last night. 
<P>
The resort was being used as a set for actress Geena Davis' latest
film, &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight.&quot;  No word on how the
movie will be affected. 
<HR>

<H3>Royal Divorce </H3>

<P>
What could be Britain's most anticipated divorce is finally going
to happen. Princess Diana has agreed to end her marriage to prince
Charles.

<H3>Locals - Throne </H3>

<P>
The federal government is prepared to give up substantial powers
to the provinces and create a new social union to keep the country
together. 
<P>
In a speech from the throne, it promises to back out of areas
such as labor training, forestry, mining and recreation. In return,
the government wants provinces to agree to common principles for
social programs and guaranteed access to social services across
the country. 
<HR>

<H3>OPSEU Day Two</H3>

<P>
Neither side is budging in the escalating strike by thousands
of Ontario government workers. The union says by midnight tonight,
all public service employees, except those designated as essential,
will be off the job. 
<HR>

<H3>Cuba Planes </H3>

<P>
The Clinton administration says it has &quot;concrete evidence&quot;
that top Cuban officials approved the downing of two civilian
planes from Florida. 
<P>
Officials say a transcript of radio transmissions show the attacking
MIG pilots, knew they were firing on unarmed civilian aircraft
during the weekend.
<HR>

<H3>Axworthy-Cuba </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy says a bill
before the US congress that would punish Canadian companies that
trade with Cuba, contravenes international law. 
<P>
The bill would deny access to American markets, to firms with
commercial links to Cuba. Axworthy says Canada has taken sufficient
measures by condemning the weekend incident. And he warns, that
US. action against Canada is no solution.
<HR>

<H3>Belgium Pileup </H3>

<P>
A nightmarish accident today on a motorway in Belgium. At least
17 people died and dozens were injured, in a blazing 120-vehicle
pileup in thick fog on a highway in the northwestern part of that
country. 
<P>
Dozens of cars and trucks were piled in a mess of tangled metal.
Police say thick fog touched off the massive pileup.
<HR>

<H3>France Wines </H3>

<P>
The Bordeaux wine industry says it has been severely hit by boycotts
over French nuclear testing in the south pacific. 
<P>
Spokesman Hubert Bouteiller says it will take several years to
repair the damage. He says the boycotts were the worst disaster
for Bordeaux since a 1991 frost cut production in half. 
<P>
French president Jacques Chirac says that, overall, French exports
have been unaffected by calls for boycotts over the tests in French
Polynesia, which ended last month.
<HR>

<H3>School Uniforms </H3>

<P>
School principals in the US are overwhelmingly in favor of uniforms
for their students. 
<P>
According to &quot;USA Today&quot;, a survey finds that 70 percent
of school principals believe violence would be reduced if pupils
were required to wear uniforms at school. The thinking is that
kids wearing designer clothes to school, are more likely to be
targets of crime.

<H3>Ont. On Strike</H3>

<P>
For the first time in its history, Ontario's civil service has
been hit by a strike. jails, ambulance services, driver's licence
bureaus, psychiatric hospitals and snowplow operators are just
some of the services affected. 
<P>
Over 25 thousand public sector workers walked off the job this
morning but that number could swell to 55 thousand mid-week if
an agreement isn't reached. 
<HR>

<H3>Evng Education </H3>

<P>
It's Black Monday for employees with the Hamilton Board of Education.
This afternoon the board announced the layoff of more than one
thousand employees, that includes 437 secondary and elementary
teaching positions. 
<HR>

<H3>Hospital Cuts Follow </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, despite a campaign promise not to chop any money from
health care, hospitals in southern Ontario are reeling from the
massive spending cuts imposed by the Harris government. Lauran
Sabourin has that story. 
<P>
<I>While Hamilton East MPP Dominic Agostino is charging that Premier
Mike Harris should lose his job, Harris policies are guaranteeing
that hundreds possibly thousands of health care workers in the
province will lose theirs. </I>
<P>
<I>The numbers are sobering. Hamilton Civic Hospitals had its
budget slashed by 14.6 million dollars and St. Catharines General
loses 3.5 million from its budget. These spending cuts mean hundreds
of jobs are at stake. </I>
<P>
<I>St. Catharines General has made serious efforts to cut costs
over the years: wings have been shut off; beds have been closed;
a closed wing that looks like it belongs in hospital in Bosnia.
The rooms are empty. No lavish spending here. </I>
<P>
<I>But St. Catharines General has to search for ways to cut back
the budget even more. Budget cutting that the public will notice.
Factory-like health delivery that will have little effect on quality.
St. Catharines General the busiest in the peninsula has been searching
for ways to move more patients more efficiently through the system.
But it feels the government may not have looked at those numbers
closely enough. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Ranger Arrested </H3>

<P>
A man wanted in the August slayings of two metro Toronto sisters
was denied bail in a Scarborough court today. 
<P>
20 year old Rohan ranger was remanded in custody. He'll be back
in court March 11th. 
<P>
Ranger, who was returned from Jamaica yesterday, and his cousin
Adrian Kinkead, are charged with first degree murder in the deaths
of Marsha and Tamara Ottey. 
<HR>

<H3>Israel </H3>

<P>
Israel's prime minister is keeping his country on the road to
peace. Shimon Peres told the Israeli legislature today that working
for peace is the only &quot;correct choice&quot; Israel can make.

<P>
The comments come following weekend bombings by Islamic suicide
bombers which killed 27 people. 
<HR>

<H3>N. Ireland Update </H3>

<P>
Soldiers carrying assault rifles are standing guard outside the
Queen's London palace today. 
<P>
The extra security measures were imposed after police found bomb
making equipment and documents at the house of an Irish republican
army guerrilla. 
<P>
The heightened security comes as British diplomats and Sinn Fein,
the political representative of the Irish republican army, met
for the first time since IRA bombs in London broke a 17 month
cease-fire.

<LI>Day of Protest 
<LI>Tory Convention 
<LI>Casselman Invu. 
</UL>

<HR>

<H3>Day of Protest</H3>

<P>
Thousands of placard waving demonstrators filled the streets of
downtown Hamilton today to protest Ontario government spending
cuts and labor law changes. 
<P>
As many as 25 thousand people took part in today's &quot;Day of
Action&quot;, and estimates are that number could triple as even
more demonstrators head to the steeltown for yet another march
planned for tomorrow. Reporter Dwight Ryan has been covering today's
events. 
<P>
(Dwight) Donna, today's rally was the first of two days of action
sponsored by the Hamilton and District Labour council. In December,
workers and their supporters attempted to shut down London...
to no avail... this time, the city of Hamilton ground to a halt
as the downtown core was sealed off. 
<P>
<I>They gathered at Dundurn Park in the shadow of Dundurn castle.
Such a historic setting was appropriate, since it was in Hamilton
that the organized labour movement in Canada began. </I>
<P>
<I>Determined to get their message through to Mike Harris and
his Tories, they marched arm in arm through the streets of Hamilton.
But along the route, there was at least one indication that not
everyone is unhappy with the Mike Harris government. </I>
<P>
<I>Crowd estimates were as high as 25-thousand. Downtown Hamilton
was sealed off with no traffic coming into or leaving the city
core. </I>
<P>
<I>Hamilton police stood by nervously hoping the protest would
remain peaceful. Tactical squads from Halton, Toronto and the
OPP stood by if needed. The crowd eventually poured into Copps
coliseum for an afternoon rally. </I>
<P>
<I>The demonstrators were fired up by a succession of speakers,
including Leah Casselman, the head of OPSEU. Her 67-thousand government
employees are set for a province-wide strike at midnight Sunday.
</I>
<P>
<I>CUPE leader Syd Ryan and Canadian Labour Congress chief Bob
White never got to speak as the program dragged on and the crowd
dispersed. But for Mike Harris and his Progressive Conservatives,
meeting a block away at the fortified Convention Centre, the message
was clear. That thousands of Ontario residents are unhappy with
his common sense revolution.</I> 
<P>
(Dwight) and Donna, organizers say this Hamilton protest won't
go unnoticed by Mike Harris and his government. They promise to
dog the premier throughout his term at Queens Park and that the
Hamilton shutdown will not be the last. 
<P>
The Action Days committee says 75-thousand people will take part
in day two of their protest. Hamilton downtown will again be shut
down when the demonstration starts again tomorrow.
<HR>

<H3>Tory Convention</H3>

<P>
(Donna) thanks Dwight. And as Dwight mentioned, tomorrow, labour
will take to the streets one more time, to show it's displeasure
with Tory policy... as the Ontario conservatives convene in this
city. 
<HR>

<H3>Casselman Invu.</H3>

<P>
One person who did agree to an interview today is a woman poised
to lead Ontario civil servants on their first strike... I spoke
with Leah Casselman, president of the Ontario Public Service Employees
Union from Copps Coliseum earlier today.

<H3>OPSEU Talks</H3>

<P>
The union representing the province's civil servants have given
the Tory government an ultimatum.... if there's no contract agreement
by midnight Sunday, members of the Ontario public sector employees
union will hit the picket lines. 
<HR>

<H3>Harris Niagara</H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris is in Niagara Falls tonight... the premier
is accepting accolades on behalf of the city's Chamber of Commerce...
originally, organizers had hoped this would help boost the premier's
image, however, on the eve of a union rally in Hamilton, opponents
were quick to take advantage of the situation. 
<HR>

<H3>Protest Opponents</H3>

<P>
There are those who don't agree with what organized labour is
doing. Some represent groups that advocate the measures being
taken by the Harris government; others are just ordinary folk
who don't want to see the regular business of any city grind to
a screeching halt. Anthony Pooley reports. 
<P>
<I>As preparations continue for the huge organized labour demonstration
tomorrow and Saturday, there are those who believe that the province's
unions are barking up the wrong tree. Not the least of those is
Gerry Nichols. He represents a right wing lobby group that supports
the Harris government ... a group that believes the majority of
Ontarians do not support the position of organized labour. </I>
<P>
<I>Indeed, Ontarians for Responsible Government thinks the days
of protest will be a huge flop. But it isn't only right wing lobby
groups that are astounding up to be counted in their anti- protest
view. Some ordinary people don't want to see the protests, either.
</I>
<P>
<I>Still, the notion of a big flop for the protest days certainly
tests credulity. More than that, ORG president Colin Brown...
who originally made the prediction ... will be far away from here
this weekend... apparently on a pre-arranged business trip that
could not be canceled. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton... Anthony Pooley... Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Prison Suicide</H3>

<P>
An inmate at the prison for women in Kingston has been found hanging
in her cell. 
<P>
A corrections Canada spokesman says the 31 year old was found
dead in her cell last night. She had apparently torn up a pillowcase
to make a noose. 
<P>
Officials won't release her name ... all they will say is that
she was from Hamilton and was serving five years for robbery,
assault, theft and fraud. 
<HR>

<H3>Kids </H3>

<P>
Victims rights groups want to see some action from Ottawa on reforming
the justice system. Today a nation wide alliance gave the government
a list of 67 ways to protect the country's children. 
<P>
One of the demands is that the faint hope clause that allows first
degree murderers to apply for parole after serving less than 15
years be changed. 
<HR>

<H3>Nfld. Elex .</H3>

<P>
Newfoundlanders are choosing who will represent them in the provincial
legislature. And, with blue skies and unseasonably warm temperatures,
the voter turnout is expected to be high. 
<P>
When he cast his ballot at a community hall outside corner brook,
Premier Brian Tobin refused to predict the outcome of the election.
<HR>

<H3>Diana </H3>

<P>
Britain's Diana, Princess of Wales, is in Pakistan on a visit
that is being touted as both charitable and political. 
<HR>

<H3>Pavarotti </H3>

<P>
Superstar tenor Luciano Pavarotti is said to have fallen for his
secretary. He's 60 ... she's 26. 
<P>
An Italian gossip magazine quotes Pavarotti as saying they're
&quot;very happy&quot;, but the situation with his wife of 35
years is &quot;delicate&quot;. there are rumors a divorce is pending.

One of Ontario's largest auto insurance companies warns if the

<P>
Health Minister David Dingwall is hinting he'll move to get tobacco
ads off the street. 
<P>
For the first time since 1989, the tobacco companies are pushing
their wares in billboards and newspaper ads.

Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy doesn't like what US presidential

couple tonight.

up while officers executed a search warrant on their home.

will pay for damages to their home. 
<HR>

<H3>More OPSEU </H3>

<P>
As of next Monday, tens of thousands of Ontario government workers
are in a legal strike position. Although the government says the
cupboard is bare, the union remains optimistic an agreement can
be reached. 
<P>
Still, both sides are miles apart on their estimates of what such
a deal will cost. Dwight Ryan has that story. 
<P>
<I>In a downtown Toronto hotel, last ditch talks continue between
the union representing tens of thousands of government employees
and the government. In numerous rooms spread throughout the massive
hotel, the two sides try to hammer out an agreement with the help
of mediator John Mather. </I>
<P>
<I>Neither side will say how its going. but management board chairman
Dave Johnson told reporters Monday that the union's demands would
cost the province more than two billion dollars. And he said the
current offer is all there is, no matter how you slice it. </I>
<P>
<I>The Ontario Public Service Employees Union represents 67 thousand
provincial government workers. Of those 12 thousand are deemed
essential workers, the other 55 thousand earned the right to strike
back in 1994. </I>
<P>
<I>The unions scoffs at the government figures in the meantime,
the talks drag on and no strike date has yet been set. </I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Dwight Ryan, Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

orange or grapes, with green handles attached. 
<P>
No problems have been reported, but some nipples tore off during
recent routine tests by Health Canada. 
<P>
About 12-hundred of the pacifiers have been sold since October.
They can be returned to the store where they were bought for refund
or exchange. 
<HR>

<H3>Mint Problems</H3>

<P>
It was introduced just yesterday, but already the new two dollar
coin may be a bust. 
<P>
Hamilton resident Mabel Decaire accidentally dropped one of the
newly minted coins and it split into two pieces... a silver colored
ring and a tiny gold disc the size of a shirt button.

<HR>

<H3>Kinkaid-New Suspect </H3>

<P>
The hunt is now on for a second suspect in the murders of Marsha
and Tamara Ottey. 
<P>
Toronto police have issued a Canada wide warrant for 20 year old
Rohan Ranger. Ranger is the former boyfriend of one of the girls
and the cousin of another murder suspect, Adrian Kinkead. 
<HR>

<H3>OPSEU Talks </H3>

<P>
The mood was somber today as negotiators for the government and
its biggest public sector union sat down to resume formal contract
talks. 
<P>
Members of OPSEU rejected the government's latest offer this weekend
by a vote of 66 percent. That lent a new urgency to contract talks
that resumed this morning. 
<HR>

<H3>Hampton Runs </H3>

<P>
The field of candidates is growing for the provincial NPD leadership.

<P>
Rainy River MPP Howard Hampton is the fourth to enter the race.
The 43 year old Hampton says his campaign is about taking back
the future. He says the Harris government is dismantling our education
and health-care systems. Hampton also believes he can attract
a broader base of voters to the New Democratic Party. 
<P>
Hampton joins MPP's Frances Lankin, Tony Silipo and Peter Kormos
in the race. 
<HR>

<H3>Chretien </H3>

<P>
The Prime Minister has broken his silence following last week's
confrontation with a protester in Hull, Quebec. 
<P>
Jean Chretien says the RCMP should have been clearing a path in
front of him, and that it's deplorable that he was forced to grab
a protester by the neck to force him out of his way. The mounties
now say they'll beef-up security around Chretien in the future.
And the protester at the centre of this incident is being coy
about whether he'll file a complaint against the Prime Minister.

<HR>

<H3>Bus Bomb</H3>

<P>
Police in London say they have two people in custody after yesterday's
IRA bomb blast aboard a double decker bus. 
<P>
One person died in the explosion. Police think he may have been
the bomber, and that the device may have gone off sooner than
planned. 
<HR>

<H3>Ferry Deaths</H3>

<P>
In the Philippines, officials say more than 50 people died and
15 are missing after a wooden ferry overturned.
<P>
The Philippine coast guard says the ship was carrying more than
twice its legal capacity. The aging ferry failed a safety check
last week. Officials say the dead include 31 children.
<HR>

<H3>Two Dollar Coin </H3>

<P>
Toonie, bearbuck, blooney, doosie, loonie two... take the time
you need picking out a name for this one. But as of today, the
coin sporting the Queen's face and a polar bear on the reverse,
replaces the two dollar bill as part of our currency. 
<P>
The Royal Canadian Mint struck 60 million of the new coins for
today's launch.

<H3>School Boards</H3>

<P>
The province can do without half of its school boards... that's
the bottom line in a report from an education task force. 
<P>
The report says a hundred and twenty million dollars could be
saved ... the school boards are fixing for a fight. 
<HR>

<H3>Voter Turnout </H3>

<P>
Civil servants from across Ontario, turned out in heavy numbers
to vote on the latest contract offer from the provincial government.

<P>
The members of OPSEU are facing massive layoffs, and union executives
say the government offer does nothing to protect their jobs ...
or their pensions. 
<P>
Up to 80 percent of the union membership is expected to vote,
province wide. OPSEU expects to receive a strong mandate to strike
from its membership, but many are saying that the vote could be
extremely close. 
<HR>

<H3>Chretien Clip</H3>

<P>
It's been the topic of the day ... the Prime Minister throttling
a protester in Hull, Quebec yesterday was the issue at water coolers,
and on talk shows all day long... some of the newspaper headlines
across the country included: the Shawinigan Scuffler, Bully or
Hero, Hull Hogan, True Grit, By the Throat, and Bring on Bouchard.

<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps says security for Chretien
was not adequate because the RCMP didn't form enough of a &quot;wedge&quot;
to block protesters from reaching the Prime Minister... and she's
calling for a review of how the Prime Minister is protected when
he meets with people in a crowd. 
<P>
Meanwhile, the man involved in the altercation with the PM isn't
saying whether he will file a complaint or not. The RCMP say if
a complaint is filed, they will investigate but it's up to the
crown to decide whether to file charges. 
<P>
Chretien himself has refused to answer any questions about the
incident today. 
<HR>

<H3>Kinkead Search </H3>

<P>
The massive manhunt for 20-year-old Adrian Kinkead in Toronto
has resulted in dozens of false alarms. Kinkead is the prime suspect
in three murders and two gunpoint rapes. 
<P>
At least four times yesterday, heavily-armed police officers swooped
down on bus stops, subways and apartments after getting calls
from people who thought they saw the fugitive. Today is the fifth
day of the search for Kinkead who is wanted in the stabbing deaths
of two Scarborough sisters and a subway ticket taker. 
<P>
There are reports this morning that frustrated investigators now
think Kinkead may have fled the city. Investigators now say Kinkead
has been ruled out as a suspect in the slaying of Toronto nanny
last weekend. Her body was found in the stairwell of a high-rise
apartment. 
<HR>

<H3>Shooting Club </H3>

<P>
A man is in critical condition after he was shot in the chest
at a nightclub in suburban Toronto early today. 
<P>
Police say the 32-year-old man and his girlfriend were leaving
the Epiphany night club in North York when they were approached
by several men. One man pointed a handgun and fired without provocation,
hitting the man in the chest. 
<P>
Police say the victim underwent emergency surgery for the life-threatening
injury at Sunnybrook Medical Centre. No suspects have been arrested.

<HR>

<H3>Ipperwash Arrests </H3>

<P>
Five months after a deadly incident at Ipperwash Provincial Park
in Ontario, police have issued arrest warrants for two aboriginal
protesters. The warrants are in connection to the incident where
protesters drove through a fence with a car and a school bus,
injuring an officer. 
<P>
Police have not yet made any arrests in the death of protester
Dudley George or in injuries suffered by two other protesters
shot during the melee.
<HR>

<H3>Ski Fatal</H3>

<P>
A 26-year-old Mississauga man has died in a skiing accident near
Collingwood. 
<P>
Police say Jeffrey MacNeil lost control while going over some
moguls yesterday and hit a tree. He died a few hours later at
Collingwood Hospital from massive internal injuries. It's not
known yet if there will be an inquest. 
<HR>

<H3>Tanker Spill </H3>

<P>
Environmental workers are racing to contain a growing oil spill
from a grounded oil supertanker off western Wales. 
<P>
The &quot;sea empress&quot; has already lost 6.8-million litres
of its cargo. Scientists say the eight-kilometre long slick will
likely pose a threat to wildlife on the Welsh coast. 
<P>
The Liberian registered tanker was carrying a full load of north
sea crude oil from Scotland to the US.
<HR>

<H3>Niagara MVA </H3>

<P>
Niagara residents are getting a closer look at just what market
value assessment will mean to them ... their assessments have
arrived in the mail...and as Dwight Ryan reports.. there are some
happy people... and some not so happy people. 
<P>
<I>Ideally, market value assessment means fairer taxes for everyone.
Those who were paying too little would pay more... those whose
taxes were too high would pay less. </I>
<P>
<I>In the Niagara region homeowners and business people are finding
that MVA often seems more unfair than fair. </I>
<P>
<I>Restaurant owner Wayne Fertich found that he'd be facing a
tax hike of 75%. But the 1992 value of his property, determined
by regional officials, was 125 thousand dollars more than he paid
for it in 1992. Fertich got a tax assessor to take another look.
Even so, his taxes will go up by nearly fifty percent.</I>
<P>
<I>At the Brass and Wicker House, Luba Yewman learned that her
taxes would skyrocket to 15 thousand a year. But regional officials
had made a mistake. She'll find out Monday what the final figure
is. </I>
<P>
<I>Grimsby residents are getting more information at MVA open
houses offered by the region. Overwhelmingly they are unhappy.
Those unhappy with their assessment have the right to appeal.
In Grimsby, Dwight Ryan, channel 11 news. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Hampton Running? </H3>

<P>
The race to replace Bob Rae is starting to get a little crowded.
Rainy River MPP Howard Hampton plans to announce on Monday whether
or not he will seek the Ontario NDP leadership. 
<P>
Hampton says he's backed by nine of the party's 10 northern MPPs,
plus a lot of former members. 
<P>
Hampton is married to Sudbury East MPP Shelley Martel. 
<P>
Toronto MPP Tony Silipo, Welland Thorold's Peter Kormos and former
cabinet minister Frances Lankin are already in the race. 
<HR>

<H3>Chrysler </H3>

<P>
A day after Ford announced it's creating 150 new jobs in Oakville,
there's word Chrysler will expand its operations in Ontario. 
<P>
The Globe and Mail says the automaker will soon announce that
it's spending a half billion dollars to overhaul its Brampton
assembly plant. The move would make the plant the sole producer
of 1998 l-h model sedans, which include the Dodge Intrepid, Eagle
Vision and Chrysler Concorde. About 32-hundred people work at
the Brampton plant, turning out one thousand cars a day. 
<HR>

<H3>Auto Preview </H3>

<P>
Are they talking about sex or cars... the Canadian International
Auto Show is underway in Toronto at the Metro Toronto Convention
Centre and SkyDome runs for nine days.. and the way car makers
talk about their vehicles is downright salacious. 
<P>
It's ten bucks to get into the world's biggest garage...and feast
your eyes on everything from a Lada to a Lamberguini... futuristic
models are also on display including a smart car, which barely
requires the aid of a driver.

<H3>Killer Evng </H3>

<P>
One of the largest manhunts in Toronto's history continues today
for a man being sought in connection with three killings. 
<P>
20 year old Adrian Kincaid is wanted in the slayings of teenage
sisters Tamara and Marsha Ottey of Scarborough and subway ticket
collector Dimitrija trah-ches-kee. Police say DNA evidence has
linked all three killings. 
<HR>

<H3>Olbr- OPSEU </H3>

<P>
The first-ever strike vote by unionized provincial civil servants
will begin as scheduled tomorrow. However, the Ontario Labor Relations
Board will also hold a hearing tomorrow to determine whether OPSEU
is giving its members &quot;fair and reasonable access&quot; to
the vote. 
<P>
The decision came today after the board heard a complaint from
a civil servant that OPSEU's voting arrangements make it too hard
to cast ballots. 
<HR>

<H3>Bulbrook Noon </H3>

<P>
A hemophiliac infected with HIV from tainted blood says authorities
have reversed themselves and agreed to give him compensation.

<P>
Mark Bulbrook had intended to complain to a Toronto news conference
today abut a decision not to give him compensation unless his
children gave up their right to sue governments and blood agencies.
But Bulbrook says the Canadian Blood Agency phoned him late last
night to tell him he would receive compensation and his children
could keep their right to sue. 
<HR>

<H3>Simpson </H3>

<P>
The depositions resumed today in Los Angeles for the OJ. Simpson
civil trial. On the hot seat today... Kato Kaelin, Simpson's former
houseguest. 
<HR>

<H3>Tunnel </H3>

<P>
Rescue workers in northern Japan say it may take several more
days before they can reach 20 people trapped inside a highway
tunnel. Crews today finally blasted apart a 50 thousand tonne
boulder that collapsed on the tunnel Saturday. 
<HR>

<H3>Singapore Druggie</H3>

<P>
A 43 year old Canadian may be put to death in Singapore. Ronald
Wilson McCulloch is charged with drug trafficking after police
discovered 1.3 kilograms of marijuana in his house. 
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy says consular officials
have visited McCulloch in prison and provided some legal advice.

<P>
A drug trafficking conviction in Singapore means an automatic
sentence of death by hanging.
<HR>

<H3>Girl Tethered </H3>

<P>
A 15 year old girl who had been ordered tethered to her mother,
is back in the custody of the state of south Carolina. A judge
says she needs the structure. 
<P>
She was ordered tethered two months ago after being charged with
several crimes. But her mother is now in the hospital. 
<HR>

<H3>New Zealand Whales </H3>

<P>
In New Zealand, rescue teams are desperately trying to save 27
pilot whales that beached at a popular tourist spot. 
<HR>

<H3>Pet Dental Care </H3>

<P>
This Valentine's Day, how would you like to kiss someone who hasn't
brushed their teeth in years? It happens more often than you think
... whenever people cuddle up with their cats or dogs. 
<P>
While dog breath may be a standing joke, it's also a sign your
pet may have gum disease. Annette Hamm takes a look at how to
keep your best friend smiling and healthy. 
<P>
<I>Gum disease is no laughing matter for dogs or cats. But studies
by the Canadian Veterinary Dental Society show more than 80 per
cent of dogs and 70 per cent of cats show signs of it. The older
the animal, the more prone it can be to gum disease. </I>
<P>
<I>A veterinary dental cleaning, while Dean (a cat) is asleep,
will remove the tartar and keep infection from setting into his
gums. To prevent this kind of cleaning from having to take place,
you can try to rub your pets teeth clean with a brush or a cloth
over your finger. Simply giving them hard food to crunch on isn't
enough to keep their teeth healthy. </I>
<P>
<I>Ignoring your pets mouth could cause tooth loss or even heart
and kidney disease. You can keep your pet feeling great by checking
in with your vet to see what kind of dental program you should
start on. </I>
<P>
<I>February is national pet dental health month, and many clinics
are offering dental specials. In Hamilton, Annette Hamm, Channel
11 News.</I>

<H3>Child Abductions </H3>

<P>
Police from across southern Ontario are focusing on London as
they search for a suspect wanted in the sexual assaults of three
children. 
<P>
Investigators are trying to determine if there is a link between
the attacks and about a dozen attempted abductions of children
in London. 
<HR>

<H3>Kladuz Trial </H3>

<P>
Jury selection began today in the trial of a man accused in a
heartbreaking child murder. 
<P>
It was July 1991 when three year old Kayla Kladuz vanished from
the fenced in yard, of her Toronto Parkdale apartment building.
Three weeks later her body was found in the Harbour. 
<P>
The trial of 36 year old David Alexander Snowden, a janitor in
Kayla's building, is expected to last 3 to 4 months. 
<HR>

<H3>Hate Clip</H3>

<P>
A groundbreaking study commissioned for the federal government
says hate crimes in Canada are much more common than we think.

<P>
The report was prepared by a University of Ottawa criminologist
and suggests that only ten percent of hate crimes are reported
to police. That lack of accurate statistical information has social
advocates worried that governments aren't doing enough to remedy
what appears to be a grossly underestimated problem. 
<HR>

<H3>Boiler </H3>

<P>
It's still unclear what caused a boiler explosion at Mohawk College
on Hamilton mountain. 
<P>
The side of a boiler, used to heat the college, blew out last
night sending an engineer to hospital. He was released and returned
to the college late last night to help investigators. 
<P>
Officials with the Fire Marshall's Office and the fuel safety
branch have been at the college all day, trying to pinpoint a
cause and a damage estimate. 
<P>
Classes at Mohawk haven't been affected, and there's apparently
no danger of another explosion taking place. 
<HR>

<H3>Rent Controls </H3>

<P>
Ontario New Democrats have launched a &quot;hands off rent control&quot;
campaign. 
<P>
The Harris government wants to get rid of rent controls, to encourage
the construction industry to build more rental units. But the
NDP say without controls ..rents will go sky high.
<HR>

<H3>Train Wreck </H3>

<P>
Cleanup crews are fighting wind and swirling snow today as they
struggle to move 25 cars that left the tracks. 
<P>
The derailment occurred yesterday on CP Rail's main line in a
remote part of a northern Ontario. At least six tanker cars carrying
liquid sulphur careened into the Spanish river, spilling their
loads. 
<HR>

<H3>Italy Crash </H3>

<P>
Notoriously fast drivers and sudden fog... a recipe for disaster
on Italian highways. 
<P>
In the latest pileup, at least 11 people were killed this morning
when 300 cars collided in a chain reaction that left twisted metal
and gasoline-fed flames across a main highway in northern Italy.

<HR>

<H3>Japan Tunnel </H3>

<P>
In Japan, hope is turning to grief as 20 people remain trapped
inside a collapsed tunnel. 
<P>
Workers failed today for a second time to blast a huge, 50 thousand
tonne boulder off the highway tunnel.  
<P>

<HR>

<H3>London Blast</H3>

<P>
The Prime Ministers of Ireland and Britain are condemning an explosion
in an east London business district. 
<P>
At least four people are badly hurt and 18 were slightly injured.
The blast came shortly after a report that the Irish republican
army has ended its 17 month old cease-fire. 
<HR>

<H3>Auto Insurance </H3>

<P>
Some major changes have been announced to Ontario's auto insurance
system with the goal to reduce premium hikes. 
<P>
Rob Sampson, the minister in charge of auto insurance reform says
Ontario consumers are entitled to stable auto insurance rates.
And he says under the new plan, accident victims would be allowed
to sue for all injuries, not just for pain and suffering.
<HR>

<H3>Lap Dancing </H3>

<P>
A former stripper is hailing an Ontario Court of Appeal ruling
that lap dancing is an indecent act. 
<P>
Katharine Goldberg says the decision will save many exotic dancers
from a lot of pain and suffering. 
<P>
The appeal court ruled lap dancing degrades and dehumanizes women
and portrays them a sex objects. The judges also say lap dancing
is a form of prostitution and violates community standards. 
<HR>

<H3>Bernardo Tapes 5 </H3>

<P>
The Ontario government disagrees with the families of Kristen
French and Leslie Mahaffy by saying the law does protect the public
from pornographic evidence. 
<P>
That argument was made in a St. Catharines court today in response
to the families claim that the law should be changed to guarantee
that pornographic evidence would not be seen or heard in a public
courtroom. 
<P>
Lauran Sabourin has more in this report. 
<P>
<I>Crown attorney John Pearson agrees that the videotapes that
show Paul Bernardo sexually brutalizing Kristen French and Leslie
Mahaffy are degrading, dehumanizing and debasing. And that allowing
access to those tapes is not in the public interest. But the issue
as the family sees it is justice Patrick Lesage's decision to
allow the public to hear the videotapes. </I>
<P>
<I>They want to the law to specify that allowing what is deemed
child pornography to even be heard by the public is harmful and
that the public should not be allowed to see or hear that evidence.
The crown's position is that the law already gives the judge the
power to clear the courtroom when such evidence is presented.
</I>
<HR>

<H3>Tapes Tag </H3>

<P>
The trustees of the French/Mahaffy Legal Assistance Fund announced
today that their fundraising efforts are winding down. 
<P>
Donations to the fund will be closed off effective March 31st,
1996. 320 thousand dollars have been raised by the fund. The trustees
say another 100 thousand dollars may be needed by the families
to continue their legal fight.
<HR>

<H3>Radarsat </H3>

<P>
Canada's pride and joy will soon be the envy of the world, as
soon as it's up and running. It's called &quot;Radarsat&quot;,
and many Canadians are waiting to see just how impressive the
technology is. 
<P>
Canada's space agency has been working on it for well over a decade
and although it's not supposed to be fully operational just yet,
our very special satellite has already been called upon.

videotapes, to be played in open court. 
<P>
That argument was made today by the lawyer representing the families.
They are fighting to have the law changed to prevent evidence
deemed as pornographic from ever being played in public. Lauran
Sabourin has more. 
<P>
<I>The arguments are complex. The issues not easily understood.
Tim Danson lawyer for the French and Mahaffy families made the
case today not only were the families rights violated by the playing
of the tapes but so were Kristen and Leslie's rights to privacy.</I>
<P>
<I>The families put the blame for what they see as a violation
of their rights squarely on the shoulders of justice Patrick Lesage.
Tim Danson says that Judge Lesage should have foreseen the harm
that making the audio tapes and subsequent transcripts available
to the public would have caused the families. </I>
<P>
<I>That the court should have foreseen that if the verbatim transcripts
of the tapes were available that books like Nick Pron's &quot;Lethal
Marriage&quot; would be written. </I>
<P>
<I>Even if the families lose the battle in this court the matter
will be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court. They see this
case as a way of showing that Kristen and Leslie's life was more
than a brutal murder. They see it as some good to come out of
a tragedy. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Latimer Appeal </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court of Canada has agreed to hear the
appeal of a Saskatchewan farmer convicted of killing his severely
disabled daughter. 
<P>
Robert Latimer was sentenced to life in prison with no automatic
chance of parole for ten years. 
<P>
In 1994, a jury convicted him of killing his 12 year old daughter
Tracy with carbon monoxide to end her suffering from cerebral
palsy. 
<P>
Last year, it was revealed that police had questioned potential
jurors in the case on issues of euthanasia, abortion and religion.
Some of those people ended up on the jury that convicted Latimer.

<H3>Oregon Flooding </H3>

<P>
The worst flooding in 30 years has much of northwestern Oregon
under water tonight. 
<P>
Days of heavy rain and melting snow has sent rivers and streams
raging over their banks. Thousands have fled their homes, and
hundreds of roadways are closed.

<H3>Student Protest </H3>

<P>
What started out as a peaceful demonstration by students at Queen's
Park has turned violent. 
<P>
Late this afternoon, the front doors to the legislature were smashed
in and about 100 students jammed inside chanting anti-government
slogans. At least two people were arrested. 
<P>
The demonstration was one of several held in cities across Canada
to protest against cuts in federal funding to the provinces for
post-secondary education. Jamie West reports. 
<P>
<I>At Hamilton's McMaster university...the day started with a
few songs and a leaflet campaign. </I>
<P>
<I>Students say wealthy corporations are getting richer at the
expense of students just trying to get by ... to make their point
all entrances to the campus were sealed off for a brief time and
all drivers turned away ...including some not sympathetic to the
cause. </I>
<P>
<I>The day had been billed as a shutdown of the campus but organizers
of an afternoon rally seemed to be working hard at motivating
the crowd. </I>
<P>
<I>A couple hundred students also converged on Queen's Park to
voice their outrage at the government, they say is creating a
two tiered system for higher education. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton Jamie West, Channel Eleven News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Cabinet -Polls</H3>

<P>
For the first time since the provincial election, the Harris government
no longer enjoys the support of the majority of Ontarians. According
to the latest public opinion poll, the liberals have surged into
the lead.
<HR>

<H3>Eves Clip</H3>

<P>
Provincial governments are pushing for wholesale changes to federal
social programs that would allow governments to charge fees for
health services, and combine provincial welfare programs with
unemployment insurance. 
<P>
The report of &quot;The Ministerial Council of Social Policy Reform
and Renewal&quot; also calls for raising the pension age from
65 to 67. 
<P>
Although Ontario endorses the over-all report, Finance Minister
Ernie Eves says raising the pension age will only save one half
of one per-cent.
<HR>

<H3>Bernardo Videos 3 </H3>

<P>
The families of slain teenagers Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy
say they were treated like second class citizens by the court
during Paul Bernardo's first degree murder trial. And today, a
constitutional expert agreed. 
<P>
Kathleen Mahoney said that when the families petitioned the judge
to ask that the tapes not be played in open court, they were not
treated as equals but given less standing than Bernardo. 
<P>
The families have launched a court battle to have a section of
the criminal code that allowed the public to hear the videotapes
declared unconstitutional. Lauran Sabourin reports. 
<P>
<I>In her affidavit filed with the court Donna French said that
the videotapes were the most vile desecration of their daughter
imaginable. And that no human being should ever experience what
they did fighting Paul Bernardo and the media. </I>
<P>
<I>But during that battle the families always felt that their
torment over the tapes was never understood by the court. The
fact that the court entertained the media requests to see the
videotapes just added injury on top of injury. There is no provision
in the law that allows victims families to have their say in a
criminal case. And for that reason constitutional expert Professor
Kathleen Mahoney says the families equality rights were violated.
The fact that the public was allowed to hear the anguished words
of Kristen and Leslie violated their freedom of speech. </I>
<P>
<I>The families position is that a section of the criminal code
that allowed the tapes to be heard in the public courtroom is
unconstitutional. It violates the victims families equality rights.
In this case it violates Kristen and Leslie's right to free speech.
</I>
<HR>

<H3>Plane Crash </H3>

<P>
More victims of a doomed charter flight have been recovered off
the Dominican republic. The US Coast Guard reports at least 105
bodies have been brought to shore. 
<P>
The plane was carrying tourists home to Germany, when it crashed
into shark infested waters last night. 
<P>
So far there are no reports of survivors.

<H3>OPSEU Final Offer </H3>

<P>
The Harris government made its final offer today, to the union
representing some 67-thousand government workers. 
<P>
If accepted, some laid off civil servants could walk away with
a full year's salary, but union negotiators say no deal. 
<HR>

<H3>French/Mahaffy 2 </H3>

<P>
Anti pornography expert Catherine Mackinaw says the tapes that
Paul Bernardo made of Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French are pornography
by any standard. 
<P>
Mackinaw testified today on behalf of the French and Mahaffy families
who are trying to change the law to ensure that sexually explicit
evidence deemed pornography would never be played in open court
again. 
<P>
Lauran Sabourin has more. 
<P>
<I>Professor Catherine Mackinaw has made the study of the impact
of pornography her life's work. She says that pornography is damaging.
It sends out a message to people that women enjoy being raped
and that rape and sexual violence are okay. </I>
<P>
<I>Mackinaw says that in her opinion the tapes that show Paul
Bernardo sexually brutalizing Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy
are pornography. She viewed those tapes in march of last year.
</I>
<P>
<I>Mackinaw used Nick Pron's book based on testimony and transcripts
at the Bernardo murder trial as evidence of how pornography and
how damaging it can be. </I>
<P>
<I>Mackinaw goes as far as to insist that those tapes should have
never even been heard in open court. </I>
<P>
<I>Twelve copies of the videos Bernardo made of Kristen and Leslie
have been held by the police. Today eight of those tapes were
destroyed. They were burned in St. Catharines police station parking
lot this morning. Two sets are being kept pending an appeal. </I>
<P>
<I>The public thought that the destruction of the tapes would
give the families some closure. That same public is asking why
they are putting themselves through this again. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Manley Clip </H3>

<P>
Industry Minister John Manley says businesses should be thinking
about people, and not just profits. 
<P>
Manley says the goal of business is to make money, but &quot;it's
also necessary to look at the effect of cuts on employees&quot;.

<P>
Many top Canadian companies are reporting strong profits but continue
to slash jobs by the thousands.

OJ. Simpson continued his media blitz today, with an appearance

<H3>E-Mail Virus </H3>

<P>
Can you imagine a computer virus that not only destroys your files,

out to be more smoke than fire. <I> </I>

<HR>

<H3>Eves-Budget </H3>

<P>
Ontario's Finance Minister Ernie Eves is being very cagey, about
how the government's promised tax cuts will affect the economy
and our pocketbooks. 
<P>
Eves appeared before pre-budget hearings today and he still won't
say when the much touted tax cuts will comes. 
<HR>

<H3>OPSEU Talks </H3>

<P>
The province says it plans to table a final contract offer to
its unionized workers tomorrow -- two days after negotiations
broke down. 
<P>
Management Board Chairman Dave Johnson suggests the offer won't
contain the job security provisions the union wants. But he says
the offer will be &quot;generous and fair.&quot; 
<P>
The province's 67-thousand unionized employees could be in a strike-lockout
position in less than three weeks. 
<HR>

<H3>Lankin-Heritage </H3>

<P>
A member of the former NDP government says a Toronto Sun story
about the Rae government bleeding a hundred million dollars from
the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund, is a lie. 
<P>
Former Northern Affairs Minister Gilles Pouliot calls it a Tory
fabrication, to divert attention from the current budget cuts.

<P>
Another former cabinet minister in the Rae government, Francis
Lankin says 60-million dollar of surplus money was taken from
the fund, and given back to the government for deficit reduction.
Premier Mike Harris, who is in Switzerland is reported to have
ordered an investigation into where the money has gone. 
<HR>

<H3>Advocacy-Newser </H3>

<P>
The Ontario Advocacy Commission is on the Tory government chopping
block ...today a legislative committee is looking into the Harris
government's proposed bill nineteen which would abolish the 18-million
dollar commission, as well as amend the consent to treatment and
substitute decisions act. 
<P>
But commission members say the Tories' plans will rob the vulnerable
of protection... and they called on the government to set up a
non profit corporation to represent people with disabilities,
and frail seniors. 
<P>
The government argues that the authority over the care and protection
of the mentally incapable should be handed back to families. 
<HR>

<H3>Bernardo Tapes-Court </H3>

<P>
The families of slain teens Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy
were back in a St. Catharines court today. 
<P>
The families are fighting to have the law changed to protect the
privacy of future victims of sexual assault.
<HR>

<H3>CBC Poll </H3>

<P>
Confirming what radio talk shows have already indicated... a poll
suggests that Canadians are not too hot on the idea of a tax on
their phone, cable and satellite t-v bills to finance the CBC.

<P>
A review committee recommended last week that federal funding
stop and a seven and a half per cent tax be levied on consumers
to raise the billion dollars the CBC needs each year. But a poll
by &quot;Insight Canada Research&quot; finds 66 per cent of the
12-hundred people questioned, oppose the tax idea. Only 19 per
cent support it.
<HR>

<H3>Home Sales</H3>

<P>
Another poll reveals that one in four Canadians plans to buy a
home in the next two years, but those buyers are likely to be
middle-aged and more affluent. 
<P>
A housing survey by the Angus Reid Group suggests families that
have outgrown their homes are expected to be the main buyers through
1996 and '97. This group is between the ages of 35 and 54, with
household incomes of more than 80-thousand dollars a year. 
<HR>

<H3>TTC Inquest </H3>

<P>
More disturbing testimony at the inquest into last summer's fatal
subway crash... the inquest is on hold right now, as lawyers argue
behind closed doors. 
<P>
Earlier today a former Toronto subway operator has told the inquest
that equipment problems were common. Adolphus Williams says there
were often broken phones on subway trains. Williams was driving
the subway train immediately behind the two that crashed -- killing
three female passengers. He says during his first few days as
a subway driver, he worked with another rookie -- and was surprised
there wasn't even a supervisor to meet them on their first run.
<HR>

<H3>China Quake </H3>

<P>
Two aftershocks have jolted terrified survivors of China's largest
earthquake in eight years as they shivered in freezing temperatures.

<P>
The Saturday night magnitude-seven quake in southwest china killed
250 people and injured 15-thousand others. Officials say more
than 186-thousand homes have collapsed leaving hundreds of thousands
of people homeless. A massive relief operation is now underway.

<HR>

<H3>Mass Grave </H3>

<P>
Senior UN sources say an investigation is under way into reports
that Bosnian Serbs used death ovens to burn Muslim victims during
the 1992 ethnic cleansing campaign. 
<P>
Meanwhile, UN special envoy for human rights, Elizabeth Rehn,
looked shocked after seeing the site of a possible mass grave
close to the former Bosnian government enclave of Srebrencia.
Human remains were scattered all over the bleak mountain clearing.

<P>
Officials estimate that up to 500 people were cut down by gunfire
on the mountain. 
<HR>

<H3>Deep Freeze</H3>

<P>
Record cold temperatures are now being blamed for seventy five
deaths throughout the United States ...and as was reported ...the
next victim might be the Florida fruit crop. 
<HR>

<H3>Cold Wine </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, Niagara area grape growers say they're concerned about
the current extreme cold snap. 
<P>
Wine grapes are susceptible to prolonged exposure to the cold.
Karl Kaiser of Inniskillen Wines says growers have been watching
their vines closely. Some have already sustained minor damage
with temperatures dropped below minus-18 for several nights in
a row. He says emergency pruning will have to take place at some
farms to prevent the damage from spreading. 
<P>
But the deep freeze is supposed to end in this part of the world
over the next couple of days.
<HR>

<H3>Tobacco Contribution </H3>

<P>
No big surprises in a consultants report released today outlining
the economic impact of Ontario's 323-million dollar tobacco industry.

<P>
What is new, is a solid facts and figures that communities in
the tobacco belt can use for future economic planning. Annette
Hamm has the story. 
<P>
<I>The study confirms what most people in southern Ontario's tobacco
belt already knew. The tobacco industry has a major impact. Especially
in the region of Haldimand Norfolk, where the industry makes up
10 per cent of the gross domestic product. </I>
<P>
<I>The 250-thousand dollar study, funded largely by the Ontario
and Canadian governments shows more than 17-thousand full and
part time workers depend on the crop. The study focused only on
tobacco production and manufacturing, not health issues surrounding
cigarettes. </I>
<P>
<I>Tobacco is a labour intensive crop. if there's a 33 per cent
decline in tobacco production, as the consultants warn could very
well happen, more than 23-hundred jobs will be lost. That would
be like shutting down the Cami Automotive plant in Ingersoll.
</I>
<P>
<I>The independent consultants hope their study will convince
provincial and federal governments to think twice before making
decisions affecting the tobacco industry. They also hope area
governments will use their data in future economic planning. in
Tillsonburg, Annette Hamm, Channel 11 News. </I>

<H3>Deep Freeze</H3>

<P>
It might be a good weekend to stay indoors, turn up the heat and
curl up with a good book. 
<P>
Frigid arctic weather is here ..at least for the weekend, and,
as Dwight Ryan reports, two expert weather forecasters disagree
on just how long winter will last. 
<P>
<I>Southern Ontario is having its turn at the deep freeze. Temperatures
have plummeted as the result of a stream of air known as the Siberian
pipeline. The cold air mass which has drifted all the way from
Siberia will keep temperatures bone-crunchingly cold at least
through the weekend. The mass has already set records for low
temperatures in northwestern Ontario and the US. Midwest. </I>
<P>
<I>Will this winter ever end? According to Canada's most famous
weather forecaster, spring is on the way. Wiarton Willie crawled
out of his hole this morning and didn't see his shadow. </I>
<P>
<I>But that one bright spot was dulled by Wiarton Willie's American
cousin, Punxatawney Phil. The Pennsylvania spotted a ray of sunshine
thus predicting at least six more weeks of winter. While road
crews repair one broken water main after another some take the
cold weather with a grain of salt. Others with a grain of something
stronger. </I>
<P>
<I>Lows over the weekend will reach near minus 25 degrees Celsius.
Much colder with the wind-chill. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Living With Cold </H3>

<P>
And with the cold weather comes the natural quest for warmth.
With that in mind doctors recommend that most people especially
young children and the elderly stay indoors. Even indoors many
will be looking to warm up the coldest corners of their homes.
But as Jamie west reports be careful how you do that....some methods
can present more potential hazards than the bitter cold itself...

<P>
<I>Could be a busy weekend.... I should have sealed that door
last fall.,.. drafty outlets no doubt a money vacuum. </I>
<P>
<I>The furnace filter...needs changing ..once a month...no wonder
my furnace is so inefficient. </I>
<P>
<I>My water pipes haven't frozen yet that's good, but I suppose
they could. I better buy a pipe thawing cable. </I>
<P>
<I>Maybe I'll buy a spaceheater... alright maybe I'll just curl
up beside the fire ... I should have had the chimney cleaned last
fall. Maybe I'll switch to a gas fireplace. </I>
<P>
<I>After Frank's visit to my house I knew I should check that
chimney, but if I'm going outside I'll need some really warm gear,
I know just the place the place to go and still preserve my fashionable
appearance... minus 30 ...snowpants for sure... ....thermal boots
check. ...gotta slide into some longjohns... ... need, gloves
serious gloves. ...a warm scarf for sure... and last but not least
some serious headgear...</I>

<H3>Mcmurtry-Courts</H3>

<P>
One of Ontario's top judges says if the Harris government goes
ahead with proposed cuts in funding to the courts, it will plunge
the province's justice system in to chaos. In an exclusive interview
with Queens Park reporter Bob Ireland, Chief Justice Roy Mcmurtry,
of the Ontario court, says the proposed cuts are short sighted
and ill-timed. 
<HR>

<H3>Flag Flap </H3>

<P>
A Toronto couple has drawn the wrath of their neighbors at a Florida
trailer park by flying the Canadian flag. The park manager demanded
that Jim and Bev Harris remove what they called &quot;an insult
to the United States.&quot; 
<P>
Clearwater Mayor Rita Garvey says she's &quot;embarrassed&quot;
over the incident, and says Canadians are welcome to fly their
flag. 
<HR>

<H3>Gene Kelly Obit </H3>

<H3>Bernardo Tapes</H3>

<P>
The families of slain teens Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy
won a small victory today. 
<P>
A judge in Toronto ruled that the copies of the sexually explicit
videotapes held by Paul Bernardo's defense team be destroyed.

<HR>

<H3>Home Alone </H3>

<P>
Police acting on a tip from a concerned citizen found two young
children home alone in a London apartment early this morning.

<P>
Police say they had to use force to enter the apartment. Inside,
they found a 21 month old girl and her ten month old brother as
well as some marijuana plants. Their 18 year old mother has been
charged. 
<P>
The children have been turned over to the care of the Children's
Aid Society. 
<HR>

<H3>MTO. - Trucks </H3>

<P>
Inspectors from the Ministry of Transport faced another dismal
set of statistics as they completed a truck safety blitz, this
time in Ancaster, near Hamilton. 
<P>
22 vehicles were inspected and ten were pulled out of service.
As Kathy Renwald reports, the ministry laid 10 charges after the
day long safety blitz. 
<P>
<I>Ministry of Transport inspectors found everything from barely
there brakes.. to sheared bolts on tires.. as they flagged down
trucks on highway 2 in Ancaster today for the safety blitz. </I>
<P>
<I>Inspector Chris Davies say the MTO hopes the safety blitzes
are effective ..but the high failure rate raises questions. </I>
<P>
<I>Davies says it was disheartening to see 50 per cent of the
trucks fail the safety inspection in the first hour. This wasn't
a random blitz ..inspectors were looking for older trucks.. trucks
that haul scrap and are prone to more tire problems.. trucks hauling
thousands of pounds of steel that can shift if not properly secured.
</I>
<P>
<I>After runaway truck wheels killed 2 people on Ontario highways
last year.. Transport Minister Al Palidini promised a crackdown..
but its been a promise without much punch. </I>
<P>
<I>The Ontario Safety League is pushing for higher fines and more
inspectors to keep unsafe trucks off the road. </I>

<H3>Train Derailment</H3>

<P>
A freight train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed in the San
Bernardino valley of southern California this morning, killing
at least one member of the crew. The subsequent fire has been
burning all day, sending toxic fumes into the air for miles. 
<HR>

<H3>Bomb Update </H3>

<P>
The death toll now stands at 73 from Wednesday's terrorist bombing
in Sri Lanka's capital. 13 more bodies were dug out of the charred

<H3>Cabinet Bar Hours </H3>

<P>
Ontario is getting ready to shed its reputation for having Canada's
tightest liquor laws. 
<P>
Consumer Minister Norm Sterling says he plans to allow extended
drinking hours to 2 a-m or 3 a-m. Critics say extended bar hours
will mean more drunk drivers on the roads... but restaurant owners
say the move will mean more jobs and more tax revenues for the
province. 
<HR>

<H3>OPSEU Demo</H3>

<P>
A group of about 40 employees from the Hamilton Family Support
Plan office staged a sit-in at the Attorney General's office in
Toronto today. 
<P>
The group is protesting the government's plan to shut down eight
regional offices ...Hamilton being one of them. 
<P>
The agency helps collect child support and searches out deadbeat
parents who don't make payments. 
<P>
The protesters were met by Hamilton East Liberal MPP Dominic Agostino.
About half the demonstrators were allowed inside the building,
without their signs, and permitted to go up to Attorney General
Charles Harnick's office. After about an hour they left without
seeing the minister..
<HR>

<H3>Harnick-Justice</H3>

<P>
Attorney General Charles Harnick says he wants to work with judges
to try to streamline the justice system. 
<P>
Harnick says he takes &quot;very seriously&quot; a letter from
the province's top three judges that argues plans to cut the justice
system could create legal chaos. 
<HR>

<H3>Sri Lanka Bomb </H3>

<P>
In international news today, an explosion in Sri Lanka has killed
at least 53 people and left as many as 14 hundred injured. A truck
packed with explosives crashed into the country's central bank
in Colombo around midday their time. It set off a string of high-rise
fires, trapping hundreds of people. 
<HR>

<H3>Oklahoma City </H3>

<P>
The two suspects in the Oklahoma City bombing were back in court
today. Lawyers for Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols want to move
the trial from the city. They claim their clients can't get a
fair trial there. 
<P>
The judge is holding four days of hearings to determine where
the trial should be held. New information has surfaced that could
give investigators more insight about a potential motive for the
attack.

<H3>Support Services </H3>

<P>
The Harris government's proposed plan to shutdown eight regional
family support plan offices, has sparked fear among employees
and advocates of the program. 
<P>
The family support plan helps collect child support and searches
out deadbeat parents who fail to make payments. ..as Jamie west
reports tonight, employees of the largest office, located in Hamilton...
say a shutdown will literally break an already overburdened system....

<P>
<I>Louise Carboneau is treasurer of OPSEU local 205. and says
not only are the government's figures not accurate, but the 70
employees of this family support plan office in Hamilton are more
than earning their keep. </I>
<P>
<I>Cheryl Lafreniere is a Hamilton attorney specializing in family
law. She says the system isn't perfect, but a possible move to
centralize the program in Toronto and introduce a 1-800 fee for
service phone line will only hurt her clients... and those paying
support will also be hurt.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Omnibus Day After</H3>

<P>
The Harris Tories have pushed their omnibus bill through the legislature.

<P>
It was passed last night despite a rowdy day of protests, and
although the bill has passed, don't expect to see all the provisions
of introduced at once.
<HR>

<H3>WCB Reform </H3>

<P>
The province's Workers Compensation Board could be the next target
of government cuts. 
<P>
A government report released today suggests cutting benefits and
rehabilitation for injured workers. The paper recommends narrowing
the range of injuries or illnesses that would qualify someone
for compensation. 
<P>
Cam Jackson, the minister responsible for Workers Compensation
Reform, says the WCB is &quot;out of control&quot;. Jackson says
he also wants to drop employer premiums to help Ontario become
more competitive. 
<HR>

<H3>Home Invasion </H3>

<P>
A teenage girl was shot and killed in a home-invasion robbery
in east Toronto last night. 
<P>
16 year-old Christie Christie was hit by a blast from a sawed-off
shotgun in her Scarborough home. Police say two people then ransacked
the apartment before fleeing. 
<P>
Investigators say the shooting was likely drug related. 
<HR>

<H3>Students Snow </H3>

<P>
Over the past 24 hours, snow squalls, snow falls and high winds
have wreaked havoc with drivers in Ontario's Grey and Bruce counties.
Many roads have now been reopened but driving conditions still
aren't that great. 
<P>
Richard Thomas tells us conditions were so bad last night, many
students ended up sleeping at school. 
<HR>

<H3>Quads Born</H3>

<P>
A Buffalo couple is counting it's blessings... four times over,
following the birth of quadruplets Saturday night. 
<HR>

<H3>New AIDS Drug </H3>

<P>
Researchers say they may have, by far, the most potent treatment
yet, for people with AIDS. It's an experimental drug that's proving
very effective in slowing down the growth of the virus.

Third and final reading of bill 26 is under way in the legislature.
Debate on the massive savings and restructuring act began this
morning. 
<HR>

<H3>Measles-Kid </H3>

<P>
A province wide campaign to vaccinate school-children against
measles began today ... amid a swirling debate on the merits of

are questioning not only the merits of the program; but the way
in which it is being carried out.

<H3>Girls-Entrepreneurs </H3>

<P>
Lesson's in real life are hard to come by when you're only 12
years old and in grade six. 
<P>
But the Wentworth County Board of Education thinks a new program
designed to spark the entrepreneurial spirit in young women, may
be just the ticket to a lifetime of self sufficiency and financial
independence.... Jamie west explains... 
<P>
<I>These are the nineties right? ...and anything men can do women
can do... just ask Investment Executive Sonia Khurana. </I>
<P>
<I>So to get the message across Entrepreneur Day was held at Highland
Secondary School in Dundas. 91 grade six girls with the help of
local business people, teachers, and older students spending the
day cutting, grinding and hand crafting their way to self sufficiency.
</I>
<P>
<I>Everything from the initial design to the final packaging of

Director Carol Houslander comes in... each young woman will try
to sell enough, jewelry or jewelry trees or gift boxes to cover
a 65 dollar fee to attend a special entrepreneur camp in may called
&quot;inventing your future&quot;. The two day camp will teach
them about the stock market, career options and will feature guest
speakers from the business and media community. </I>
<P>
<I>A similar program for grade six boys is now being planned.

<H3>Exorcism Verdict </H3>

<P>
Two people have been convicted of manslaughter for killing a two
year old girl during a bizarre exorcism ritual last year. 
<P>
The girl's 23 year old mother and 57 year old neighbor were convicted
today in the killing of Kira Canhotto. 
<P>
The toddler choked to death last January, while being force-fed
water at a home in Cambridge. 
<HR>

<H3>Harnick-Justice </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, Ontario's Attorney General says he wants to slim down
the province's justice system. 
<P>
Charles Harnick told the Canadian Bar Association today the government
plans to shift most civil and criminal cases out of the court
system. He also said he wants a new &quot;court services agency&quot;
to manage the justice system without involving his ministry. 
<HR>

<H3>Hydro-Private</H3>

<P>
A study released today says that Ontario Hydro should be privatized...
and competition should be allowed in the delivery of electrical
power. But there are differing views on whether dumping the debt-
ridden utility would mean lower or higher Hydro rates. Anthony
Pooley reports. 
<P>
<I>Add Ontario Hydro to the public utilities endangered species
list. Sir Adam Beck may well have been turning over in his grave
today as Hydro's current president Allan Kupcis heralded the possible
demise of the giant, debt-burdened electrical utility. </I>
<P>
<I>A proposal prepared for the Harris government recommends the
privatization of Hydro by the year 2000, and an end to its monopoly,
suggesting cheaper power would come as a result. </I>
<P>
<I>But Power Workers' Union president John Murphy has a decidedly
different view of the situation. He cites US figures that show
private electrical utilities charge their customers more than
the public ones. The study was done by a committee headed by Donald
Macdonald, a former liberal cabinet minister under Pierre Trudeau.
</I>
<P>
<I>The final report is due by the end of April. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Conservation Cuts </H3>

<P>
Ontario's conservation authorities have been braced for funding
cuts for the past couple of years. Bill 26 is speeding up the
process. 
<P>
Under the bill, municipalities can decide if they'll continue
to fund conservation authorities. Annette Hamm takes a look at
where the authorities are headed. 
<P>
<I>Flood control was the main mandate when conservation authorities
were formed in the late 1940's. It still is, but many authorities
expanded into recreational areas. </I>
<P>
<I>Now, faced with provincial and municipal funding cuts, many
are turning back to the basics of watershed planning and management.
That could mean dropping programs many people associate the authorities
with. Education programs for school kids could be among the first
to go. Depending on staff levels, special events may be dropped.
</I>
<P>
<I>For several authorities, visitors will pay for parking this
year where they've never paid before. Park gate admissions will
rise. Only self sufficient campgrounds and nature centres will
survive. </I>
<P>
<I>For the Grand River Conservation Authority, the cuts mean ploughing
under an 800-thousand dollar farm program. Many authorities are
looking for alternative private funding to keep their programs
alive. </I>
<P>
<I>But for those who can't come up with extra money, the head
of Hamilton Region's Conservation Authority worries the end may
be near with no municipal backup. </I>
<P>
<I>But whatever budget cuts conservation authorities face this
year, they'll see again in 1997. Annette Hamm, Channel 11 News.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Late Letter </H3>

<P>
62 years ago Jim Post was supposed to get a brochure from a national
sales training association in Chicago. It never came - that is
until today. 
<P>
Beth Bailey is the letter carrier in the neighbourhood where Post
used to live. She finally tracked him down at the Windsor nursery
home where he now lives now. And today Jim post got his mail.

<H3>Cabinet Noon</H3>

<P>
The Chretien cabinet has a new look today. 
<P>
The Prime Minister shuffled his cabinet with an aim to put a new
face on his government as it tackles looming unity troubles. His
goal is to set the Liberals on a course to fight the next election
and the next referendum, both of which could come in 1997. 
<HR>

<H3>Cabinet - Ontario</H3>

<P>
Today's shuffle affects most of the cabinet members from Ontario...
and there is one new face from this province... as Anthony Pooley
reports.

<I>It is perhaps the continuation of a political dynasty in Brant,

<I>Sudbury's Diane Marleau remains in the cabinet as Public Works

<H3>Harris-Bill 26</H3>

<P>
With only four days left before the Harris government presents
its omnibus bill to the legislature, both the public and opposition
parties are desperately trying to delay the vote. 
<P>
Today Liberal Leader Lyn McLeod made a motion that would force
the Premier to appear before a legislative committee to answer
questions on the bill. And then she dropped a bombshell saying
her party had obtained a confidential government document outlining
how 96 million dollars can be chopped from OPP budgets.
<HR>

<H3>Harris Doc Fraud </H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris says a lesson can be learned from an outrageous
OHIP claim deliberately filed by a Georgetown Doctor. 
<P>
Dr. Mike Dunn claims he was testing the system when he filed a
false billing for performing a heart-lung transplant at a patient's
home, using a local anesthetic. Dunn was paid for the billing
but says he won't keep the money. 
<P>
The premier says the government will look into whether Dunn should
be punished. 
<HR>

<H3>Harris Trade </H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris says the team Canada trade mission to South
Asia was an important step in Ontario's economic recovery that
resulted in more than 50 potential contracts for Ontario companies.

<P>
At a news conference accompanied by over a dozen businessmen who
were on the mission, the Premier voiced his support for Co-ordinate
Ontario Trade Efforts, rather than individual companies looking
for business abroad. 
<P>
Today, Harris was asked about doing business with countries which
employ child labor and do not recognize human rights. 
<HR>

<H3>Cambridge Economy </H3>

<P>
But while the Premier is busy trying to boost business ... many
say, Ontario is going down the drain. Layoffs seem to be everywhere.
Everywhere but Cambridge. 
<HR>

<H3>Copps-Heritage</H3>

<P>
In Ottawa tomorrow, Prime Minister Jean Chretien will be doing
the cabinet shuffle. The Prime Minister is expected to announce
changes early Thursday morning in his federal cabinet. 
<P>
There is much speculation he will dump three of his top ministers
... Foreign Minister Andr&eacute; Ouellet, International Trade
Minister Roy Maclaren and Heritage Minister Michel Dupuy. Deputy
Prime Minister Sheila Copps is expected to shift to the heritage
job from her current environment portfolio. 
<HR>

<H3>Stranded Snow-er </H3>

<P>
A snowmobiler was left stranded in a pond in Sault Ste. Marie
for almost seven hours, despite calls to police. 
<P>
38 year old Gary Marshall was snowmobiling Friday night when his
machine plunged into a pond, stranding him in waist-high water.
When a friend called police, a sergeant said he wouldn't call
rescue crews because the situation wasn't life threatening. 
<P>
Marshall was eventually rescued Saturday morning by the OPP. He
says he plans to file a complaint. 
<HR>

<H3>Fishermen Rescued</H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, three Windsor area men are safe and sound tonight after
spending most of last night on frozen lake St. Clair. The ordeal
began when the three men lost their way in thick fog, then became
stranded by open water. 
<HR>

<H3>Deposition Day 3</H3>

<P>
Ronald Goldman's sister has lashed out at OJ Simpson saying he's
afraid to face her. 
<P>
Simpson's lawyers have barred Kim Goldman from sitting in, on
his deposition, in a wrongful death suit. the suit was brought
by the families of Goldman and Nicole Brown. And Simpson will
be on the hot seat tonight when he sits down with a reporter for
his first televised interview since his acquittal in October.

<H3>KPMG - Hamilton </H3>

<P>
The nation's economy is expected to grow by 2.5-percent this year,
and Hamilton will maintain its competitive advantage. This according
to survey result's from some of Canada's leading economic thinkers,
prepared by KPMG. 
<P>
But as Anthony Pooley reports tonight, other economic forecasts
are not so optimistic. 
<P>
<I>It has been said that if one asks the same question of 10 different
economists, there could well be 10 different answers. Case in
point: KPMG's annual survey of economic expectations released
today. The results are based on the predictions of 30 private
sector economists, and optimistically predict that the Canadian
economy will grow by 2.5- percent this year ... fueled by auto
and export industries, especially those that sell to the US, which
in Canada means most of them. </I>
<P>
<I>The only problem is this ... a number of other private sector
economists have revised downward the 1996 growth predictions they
made last year. For example... today Scotiabank's global economic
outlook predicted a 1.8 percent economic growth rate, citing a
lack of income growth, depleted savings, and high debt loads for
most Canadians. </I>
<P>
<I>They do agree on one thing, though. Unemployment is expected
to remain at about 9-and-a-half percent. </I>
<P>
<I>The dollar is expected to remain below 80- cents u-s during
1996, but soft consumer spending and government cutbacks will
take their toll on the economy this year. In Hamilton... Anthony
Pooley Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Can. Pension</H3>

<P>
A member of the Canada Pension Plan Advisory Board says there's
nothing wrong with the plan. 
<P>
Monica Townson says Ottawa's push to reform the retirement income
system is motivated by ideology, not money. 
<P>
Townson says it is incorrect to say the pension plan is broke
and facing a crisis because the population is aging. She told
an Ottawa news conference the debate over the plan has been hijacked
by those like the Reform Party, which would replace it with mandatory
RRSP's.
<HR>

<H3>Cashing RRSP's </H3>

<P>
Thousands of people under retirement age, withdrew billions of
dollars from their RRSP's in 1993, to cope with financial crises.

<P>
Statistics Canada says a record 650 thousand individuals under
the age of 65, withdrew 3 and a half billion dollars. The figure
represents a 31 percent increase from 1990 and a six percent jump
from 1992. 
<HR>

<H3>Subway Inquest </H3>

<P>
The rookie driver involved in a fatal subway crash in Toronto,
says he was terrified behind the wheel. And Robert Jeffrey told
a coroner's inquest today that he didn't feel comfortable with
the amount of training he received. He also apologized to the
families of the victims. 
<P>
The accident killed three women and injured about 30 passengers
last august. It was Jeffrey's second day on the job as a subway
driver. 
<HR>

<H3>Snowmobilers</H3>

<P>
Provincial police say alcohol was a contributing factor in a snowmobile
accident that killed four men. 
<P>
Divers found nine full bottles of beer on the bodies of the snowmobilers
who drowned last Saturday when their machines plunged through
thin ice. 
<P>
One of the men who died, had fallen through ice on a snowmobile,
on two previous occasions. 
<HR>

<H3>Kormos Runs </H3>

<P>
NDP &quot;bad boy&quot; Peter Kormos is the first official candidate
in the race to replace retiring leader Bob Rae. 
<P>
Kormos says the NDP has gone too far to the right and he wants
to bring it back to its social democratic roots. 
<P>
Ten days ago, former premier Bob Rae announced he was leaving
politics to join a law firm. A new leader will be chosen at the
NDP convention this summer. 
<HR>

<H3>Firefighters b-26 </H3>

<P>
Firefighters from across Ontario are accusing Premier Mike Harris
of lying to them. 
<P>
Hundreds of firefighters swarmed onto the front lawn of the Ontario
legislature today to protest the government's controversial omnibus
bill. They claim it threatens public safety, by eroding the quality
of fire fighting service in the province. 
<P>
The firefighters also accused Premier Mike Harris of breaking
a campaign promise.
<HR>

<H3>School Funding </H3>

<P>
Is it an issue of discrimination? or, is it a bid to get the public
to pay for private schools? 
<P>
The Supreme Court of Canada began a two day hearing in Ottawa
this morning, that could determine whether Ontario will pay for
religious schools in the province. Scot Urquhart has more in this
report. 
<P>
<I>Suzie Adler took her case to a higher court, this morning.
The highest court in the land. </I>
<P>
<I>Her fight, is to force Ontario to fund a Jewish school, for
her daughter: but this perceived shackle on religious freedom,
is viewed quite differently by the province who see these schools
doing something else: crossing the line into the realm of private,
specialty schools. </I>
<P>
<I>George Petrusma doesn't deny, that his institution sees education
from a different perspective: and for many of these students,
the examination of life from a Christian view, is a good thing:
whether all taxpayers should stand with them; and pay for that
point of view, is for the court to decide: Scot Urquhart, Channel
Eleven News. </I>

<H3>Bill 26 Latest </H3>

<P>
One week from tonight, the province's controversial omnibus bill
is scheduled to pass through the Ontario legislature. But today
a group of opposition MPP's promised to break rank with their
own parties' and do everything possible to delay passage of that
bill. 
<HR>

<H3>OPSEU Strike</H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, unionized government workers in Ontario say they're
waiting for a final contract offer from the Harris government
before taking a strike vote. 
<P>
At a union rally in Sudbury today, OPSEU president Leah Casselman,
said her members are prepared for the worst. 
<P>
65 thousand OPSEU members could hit the picket lines next month,
something they've never done before. Lack of negotiations, pensions
and job security are the main stumbling blocks to an agreement.

<HR>

<H3>Kormos-NDP Leader </H3>

<P>
Ontario's former Consumer Minister Peter Kormos is expected to
announce his bid to lead the NDP tomorrow. 
<P>
The MPP for Welland Thorold would be the first to formally declare
his candidacy to replace outgoing leader Bob Rae. 
<P>
Kormos has called a news conference for tomorrow morning, but
is being non committal about its purpose. However, it is no secret
that the Welland MPP has been thinking about replacing Bob Rae
as leader of the party. 
<HR>

<H3>Drownings</H3>

<P>
Tragedy struck southern Ontario this past weekend as icy waters
claimed the lives of six men in two separate accidents. 
<P>
Four friends died in a lake northwest of Peterborough when they
drove their snowmobiles into an open patch of water Saturday.
OPP divers pulled their bodies from 12 mile lake yesterday. 
<P>
And last night, a father and his stepson died trying to save their
dog in a lake near Mississauga. The men, aged 42 and 24, fell
through the ice trying to reach the dog, which survived. 
<HR>

<H3>Jobless Finances</H3>

<P>
Thousands of Canadians are losing their jobs. It seems everyone
knows someone who is out of work. But losing your job isn't the
end of the world ...and a Hamilton financial advisor is offering
seminars on how to survive the transition. Dwight Ryan has the
details. 
<P>
<I>Down-sizing, re-structuring, no matter what its called, people
continue to lose their jobs. And as governments continue their
cuts, more job losses will come. </I>
<P>
<I>If you've been right-sized, re-focused, or re-engineered out
of your job, you are facing one of life's most stressful situations.
Chances are times will be tough...at least for a while. </I>
<P>
<I>Financial Advisor Rebeckah Schnurr offers counseling to the
worried jobless. She believes keeping as much of your severance
away from Revenue Canada is a good start. And on the upside you
now control your pension dollars. Chances are the way you invest
it will pay more than you were getting. </I>
<P>
<I>And Schnurr says forget about those accelerated mortgage payments
..at least for now. Creditors often bend the rules until you're
working again. </I>
<P>
<I>As well, Schnurr says benefit packages usually end when you
lose your job. But you can shop around for independent coverage.
Then free-lance your skills. </I>
<P>
<I>Rebeckah Schnurr believes when one door closes, two will open.
And that losing your job at least got you out of the rut you didn't
like anyway. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton, Dwight Ryan, channel 11 news. </I>

<H3>Bill 26 - Hamilton </H3>

<P>
Health Minister Jim Wilson today tabled 69 amendments to the government's
controversial omnibus bill. 
<P>
The key amendment shelves a plan to create a new group of inspectors
with the power to investigate doctors and seize the confidential
records of patients. Under the changes a special body of physicians
would have to give the government permission to collect and disclose
patient records. 
<P>
The amendments came on the last day of hearings on the bill in
Hamilton, where healthcare was the hot topic and some presenters
were hot tempered. Jamie West reports.... 
<P>
<I>Those sentiments were echoed by a number groups and individuals
attending the hearings at the Hamilton Convention Centre many
were angry that they did not receive standing to present their
concerns to the committee.</I>
<P>
<I>Dr. Gordon Guyatt's Medical Reform Group says Ontario is well
on it's way to a two tiered health care system. </I>
<P>
<I>The proceedings were interrupted briefly by protesters, who
just one floor below held a shadow hearing to protest the fact
that they were refused standing. </I>
<P>
<I>NDP Finance Critic Frances Lankin attacked today's announced
healthcare amendments to bill 26. She says the 69 changes will
allow the government to bypass the house anytime they want to
make changes to healthcare laws. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Boards-Snobelen</H3>

<P>
Ontario 's public school boards want the Harris government to
phase in funding cuts over a longer period of time. 
<P>
The government says it will cut 400-million dollars from provincial
schools by September this year. 
<HR>

<H3>AG Museum Future</H3>

<P>
Since last November, the month the Harris government announced
it was cutting funding to the Ontario Agricultural Museum, there
has been a groundswell of grassroots efforts to save it. 
<P>
The museum is set to close for good in March of next year. But
as Annette Hamm tells us, several organizations are sowing the
seeds for a new start. 
<P>
<I>It's supposed to be quiet this time of year at the Ontario
Agricultural Museum in Milton. The museum usually doesn't open
for visits until the spring, but this spring could be its last.
</I>
<P>
<I>Because of provincial funding cuts, half of the museums 52
workers will lose their jobs this year ... and the site will close
for good march 31, 1997. </I>
<P>
<I>The museum's collection of 15-thousand artifacts is expensive
to display. An audit two years ago shows the museum costs 31 dollars
per visitor to run. </I>
<P>
<I>The museum is so important that a newly formed organization,
the Agricultural Museum Preservation Committee, wants to work
with farm machinery and seed companies to raise money for the
site. Closing the 80 acre site forever seems to be a worst case
scenario. </I>
<P>
<I>The museum will be open for business this year, but on a reduced
basis. </I>
<P>
<I>In Milton, Annette Hamm, Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Harris Form 1</H3>

<P>
And a footnote to a story we ran Wednesday. 
<P>
A Burlington doctor had issued a form one under the Mental Health
Act, asking police to pickup Ontario Premier Mike Harris for psychiatric
assessment. However, in a news release this afternoon, Halton
Regional Police stated that following a review of the document
it was decided the document was invalid and would therefore not
be acted upon. 
<HR>

<H3>Rae New Job</H3>

<P>
Former Ontario Premier Bob Rae has a new job. Rae will join one
of Canada's largest law firms next month. 
<P>
Rae, who announced his resignation as NDP Leader last weekend,
will become a partner at Goodman Phillips and Vineberg on February
7th. That's the same day he officially leaves politics. 
<HR>

<H3>Pension Clip</H3>

<P>
Ottawa is looking at some big increases in Canada Pension Plan
premiums. 
<P>
The Toronto Star quotes sources as saying that a report due for
release with the next federal budget, will recommend doubling
those premiums over the next four years. 
<P>
Without bigger premiums, the plan will not have enough money to
cover it's obligations as baby boomers begin to retire in the
next century. But not everyone is in favour of the idea. 
<HR>

<H3>Loomis Robbery </H3>

<P>
A surprising twist today in the investigation into a three million
dollar armored car robbery in Toronto. 
<P>
Two more people, including a Toronto police officer, were charged
today in connection with the holdup. 
<P>
Last august, an armed man wearing a police uniform, made off with
three million dollars in a Loomis truck. A Loomis employee was
charged last September. Today, a Woodbridge man and a Metro Toronto
Police Constable face similar charges.

<H3>Justice Delays </H3>

<P>
The head of the province's crown attorney's association predicts
a breakdown of the province's justice system if feared layoffs
take place. And Paul Vesa says if the feared cuts do occur, a
lot of criminal cases are simply going to be lost. 
<HR>

<H3>Crime Clip </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, Canada's Crime Prevention Council is warning federal
politicians that cuts to social programs will lead to a dramatic
increase in crime. 
<P>
The council's chair says that unless the government eases up on
its defect fighting course, crime in this country could double
within the next five to ten years. 
<HR>

<H3>Immigration Charges </H3>

<P>
Two Canadian immigration officers are under arrest, and nine others
face charges, after the RCMP cracked a conspiracy to smuggle as
many as 150 illegal aliens into Canada. 
<P>
The scam involved a plan to sell business visas to Asians attending
a mythical trade show. And that investigation led to the discovery
of a ring that brought women into the country illegally to work
as prostitutes. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>Five police forces and Canada's Immigration department co-operated
in a lengthy investigation that culminated in the arrest of eleven
people. </I>
<P>
<I>An official says the visas were offered to as many as 150 people
for thirty-thousand dollars apiece. The business Visa investigation
also uncovered a secondary operation that smuggled women into
Canada for the purposes of prostitution. </I>
<P>
<I>Police have charged eleven people, including two immigration
officers who worked at Pearson International Airport. </I>
<P>
<I>Canada's Immigration Department says an independent assessment
of its procedures will now be expanded to include entries at airports
and border points, in Toronto, Deborah Walker, Channel Eleven
News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Barnett Death</H3>

<P>
The head of Ontario's special investigations unit blames a &quot;regrettable
news report&quot; for causing an uproar against police in Toronto
today. 
<P>
A Toronto newspaper claimed the SIU had decided no charges would
be laid against a metro Toronto police officer who shot a black
man earlier this month. 
<P>
The SIU says it's probe into the death of Tommy Barnett is still
in the early stages, but Barnett's family is making demands of
their own. Annette Hamm explains. 
<P>
<I>Tommy Barnett's family describes his shooting death as a continuing
brutal assault by metro police against blacks. </I>
<P>
<I>22 year old Barnett was shot three times by a metro sergeant
after he reportedly pulled out a sword and started waving it around.
Some witnesses say Barnett ignored warnings to drop the sword,
which he allegedly pointed as police approached him. </I>
<P>
<I>Members of Barnett's family and the Black Action Defence Committee
called their news conference just hours before the province's
Special Investigations Unit denounced a news report the unit had
cleared the officer involved of any wrongdoing. </I>
<P>
<I>Despite family and public demands, the SIU says it can't give
a date when it's work will be complete. The Black Action Defence
Committee is demanding it's own independent investigation and
autopsy in the Barnett case. Annette Hamm, channel 11 news. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Leach-Amendments</H3>

<P>
The New Democrats say Municipal Affairs Minister Al Leach should
resign over his gaffes on bill 26. 
<P>
NDP house leader Dave Cooke says government amendments to the
cost cutting bill contradict Leach's claim that municipalities
would not have the power to levy new gasoline, income and sales
taxes. 
<P>
Before Christmas, leach had offered to resign if bill 26 were
to allow such taxes. Cooke says leach &quot;either misled the
legislature or did not understand his own legislation.&quot; 
<HR>

<H3>McLeod-Bill 26</H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, the provincial Liberals have called for 150 changes
they want made to the government's omnibus bill. One of those
changes includes separating the bill into seventeen parts. 
<P>
Liberal Leader Lyn McLeod says the government is stumbling around
like a crazed pit bull, with no idea where its going but determined
to do as much damage as possible along the way. 
<P>
McLeod says she found yesterday's amendments to the health section
of bill 26, offensive. McLeod says if the jumbo bill is passed,
you might as well advertise Ontario as &quot;the home of the user
fee&quot;.

<H3>OFL Strike</H3>

<P>
The Ontario labor movement has named Hamilton as its next target
for a mass demonstration. 
<P>
The protest is part of labor's fight against the cutbacks and
labor reforms of Ontario's Tory government. 
<P>
The picketing will take place on both Friday February 23rd and
Saturday the 24th, the same week-end the Conservatives are holding
their annual convention in Hamilton. 
<HR>

<H3>Lankin Health </H3>

<P>
NDP Health Critic Frances Lankin says &quot;bill 26&quot; is still
a very bad bill, even with proposed amendments. 
<P>
Health Minister Jim Wilson announced the amendments today. The
amendments include limiting his power to close or merge hospitals
to four years. Lankin and Liberal Leader Lyn McLeod say the amendments
are minimal because the bill would still give Wilson the power
to close hospitals. 
<HR>

<H3>Budget Clip </H3>

<P>
Canada's Finance Minister is being given a blunt warning about
his upcoming federal budget. The commons finance committee says
the government must continue its attack on the deficit. 
<P>
But the Liberal-dominated committee also had some suggestions
for collecting more revenue. They include increasing the taxes
on gasoline and tobacco. 
<P>
Another suggestion would put a tax on lottery winnings ... an
idea rejected last year. 
<HR>

<H3>Casino Preps</H3>

<P>
Canada is being accused of declaring an aesthetic war on US sensibilities
at Niagara falls. 
<P>
An editorial in the Buffalo News charged that the proposed casino
development in the honeymoon city is just another example of Canadians
contaminating Americans view of the falls. 
<HR>

<H3>Infectious Diseases</H3>

<P>
Doctors were once confident they had infectious diseases on the
run. But new data show that these potential killers are surging
back.

<H3>Golden Report </H3>

<P>
A task force report released today, is recommending drastic changes
to the political structure and taxing system in the greater Toronto
area. 
<P>
The area affected, stretches from Burlington on the west to beyond
Oshawa in the east. 
<HR>

<H3>Racism Clip </H3>

<P>
A commission on racism in Ontario's justice system has concluded
the problem is rooted in the system itself. 
<HR>

<H3>Harris Apologizes</H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris has apologized to dancer Karen Kain, who was
refused entry to the legislature during a protest last November.

<P>
Kain tried to enter the building with petitions signed by ten
thousand people protesting provincial cuts to the arts. 
<P>
Harris wrote Kain last month to say he was &quot;shocked&quot;
to find out she wasn't allowed to deliver the messages to his
office. He thanked her for bringing the petition to his attention
but said the province &quot;is in a financial crisis&quot; and
must take a look at its role in funding activities, including
the arts. 
<HR>

<H3>PABIAC. Regs.</H3>

<P>
At the moment; it is costing us millions. Rehabilitation for more
than 70 brain-injured Canadians, in American facilities, is costing
the province more than it is willing to pay. 
<P>
The government wants to bring these patients home; but at the
moment, a lack of facilities, expertise, and especially standards
could mean, that a different kind of price; could be paid by the
patients. Scot Urquhart reports. 
<P>
<I>The health minister has opened the door ... but is Ontario
ready to bring 80 brain-injured Canadians home from treatment
centers in the states? </I>
<P>
<I>And that's what this meeting, is all about. This is the Provincial
Acquired Brain Injury Advisory Council; or PABIAC. A sort of stakeholders
group representing all of the players, in the brain injury field.
</I>
<P>
<I>And that's where Chris McDonell comes in. She represents CARF:
the American group that sets the standards for accreditation south
of the border.  In a field where Americans have more than two
decades of experience, while Ontario has virtually none, the government
says it will bring Canadian patients home over the next three
years.</I>
<P>
<I>PABIAC is hoping that before they get here, the industry will
not only have standards in place for their treatment, but provincial
regulations, that will require rehabilitation therapists to adhere
to those standards. </I>

<I>In Toronto, Scot Urquhart Channel Eleven News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Bosnia Clip</H3>

<P>
Defence officials moved to head off yet another controversy over
the behaviour of peacekeeping troops today, after allegations
surfaced that Canadian soldiers beat patients, hosted wild parties
and had sex with nurses at a mental hospital in Bosnia. 
<P>
The soldiers from Val Cartier Quebec, were assigned to help inmates
at the hospital back in 1994. Defence officials claim the allegations
are unfounded. 
<HR>

<H3>Russia-Chechnya </H3>

<P>
In world news tonight, Russian troops and Chechyn rebels battled
hand-to-hand today among a village's burned-out houses. 
<P>
Federal forces are trying to wipe out the separatists and free
dozens of hostages. Russian security officials say 26 of the hostages
have been released since the Kremlin launched the assault on the
village yesterday. The fate of the 100 or so remaining hostages
is unclear. 
<HR>

<H3>Yeltsin </H3>

<P>
Whenever a government unholsters its military, there is a political
consequence, sometimes good, sometimes not. 
<P>
Those consequences are currently playing out in and around Russia's
new parliament.

<H3>NDP Leadership </H3>

<P>
Less than 48 hours after their leader announced he was leaving
politics, the battle over control of Ontario's New Democratic
Party has already begun. <BR>
In a speech Saturday, former Ontario Premier Bob Rae accused some
labor leaders of burying their &quot;heads in the sand&quot; for
failing to try to understand the changes taking place in the economy.
But one MPP who is contemplating a run at the leadership, Peter
Kormos, disagrees saying the party needs to veer sharply to the
left if it is to survive. 
<HR>

<H3>Snobelen-Teachers</H3>

<P>
While it was in power, the NDP lost a lot of support from teachers
unions across the province... but now it appears the Tory government
is finding itself in the same situation. 
<P>
A weekend teacher protest at Queen's Park attracted thousands
opposed to education cuts. But the province's education minister
is sticking to his guns. Dwight Ryan has the story. 
<P>
<I>By some estimates, thirty thousand teachers and their supporters
marched on Queen's Park over the weekend. Their message was clear
...they're mad as hell, and they're not going to take it anymore.
</I>
<P>
<I>The Tories say they will slash 400 million dollars from the
massive education budget. It represents just three percent of
the nearly 14 billion dollars the province spends on education
each year. </I>
<P>
<I>In a question and answer forum, Snobelen was short on specifics.
Snobelen has angered teachers by saying they should spend more
time in the classroom. Teachers meanwhile say Saturday's protest
is just the beginning. </I>
<P>
<I>In Burlington, Dwight Ryan, Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Smoking Clip </H3>

<P>
They may be getting the message that it's &quot;harmful to their
health&quot; still new information from Statistics Canada today
shows that more and more kids are lighting up. 
<P>
In the first ever national survey of its kind, Statistics Canada
found that one in seven Canadian youths, aged 10 to 19, smokes
cigarettes, this despite knowing of it's harmful effects. Peer
pressure appears to be the reason for the habit. Almost three
out of four young smokers said they started because their friends
did. 
<HR>

<H3>Kitchener Fire</H3>

<P>
Police say a candle dropped by a teacher caused a big fire at
a school in Kitchener. The entire east wing of Wilson Avenue Public
School was destroyed yesterday. 
<P>
The candle was dropped in a junior kindergarten room but police
have not said what it was being used for. No one was hurt in the
fire, but a teacher in the school at the time was treated in hospital
for &quot;emotional stress.&quot; Classes were canceled today.

<HR>

<H3>GTA Reaction</H3>

<P>
A controversial report which recommends the elimination of five
regional governments in favour of one large greater Toronto area
will be tabled tomorrow. 
<P>
But even before it is submitted, opposition to the proposal continues
to grow. 
<HR>

<H3>Genie Awards </H3>

<P>
The Canadian film industry has honored its own, and the top honor
goes to &quot;La Confessional.&quot; 
<P>
The film won the award for best motion picture at the 16th Annual
Genie Awards in Montreal last night. 
<P>
&quot;La confessional&quot; also won a best feature film director
award for the work of Robert Lepage. But it was &quot;Margaret's
Museum&quot; that picked up the most genies -- six in all. <I>

<H3>Subway Murder </H3>

<P>
A 15-year-old boy has been stabbed to death at a subway station
in suburban Toronto. 
<P>
Police say it happened at around four o'clock this afternoon at
the Kennedy station. It has been closed indefinitely. 
<P>
The boy's name has not been released. Metro homicide detectives
are investigating. 
<P>
Last year, a subway ticket collector was stabbed to death during
a robbery at nearby Victoria Park Subway Station. 
<HR>

<H3>Gayle Appeal </H3>

<P>
Clinton Gayle will appeal his conviction. 
<P>
He was convicted of first-degree murder yesterday in the shooting
death of Metro Toronto Police Constable Todd Baylis during a fight
in June of 1994. Gayle was also convicted of attempted murder
for wounding Baylis's partner Mike Leone. 
<P>
Justice David Watt sentenced Gayle to life in prison with no chance
of parole for 25 years. Gayle's lawyer, Michael McLachlan, says
there are several possible grounds for an appeal. 
<HR>

<H3>Mafia Funeral </H3>

<P>
A North York baker reputedly linked to organized crime was laid
to his final rest today. 
<P>
38-year-old Frank Loiero was gunned down, Mafia-hit style, in
a Woodbridge store parking lot last Sunday night. Police suspect
hit men used silencers on their guns as they pumped as many as
a dozen shots into Loiero. 
<P>
The dead man was still wearing expensive jewelry and was carrying
5 thousand dollars in cash when his body was found. 
<HR>

<H3>Jail Suit</H3>

<P>
Guards at Toronto's Don Jail say overcrowding of inmates there,
constitutes a powder keg, just waiting to explode. And the guards
fear for their lives. 
<HR>

<H3>Bob Rae Future</H3>

<P>
There is speculation tonight that former premier Bob Rae is getting
set to resign as leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party. 
<P>
If Rae does throw in the towel, it will be at tomorrow's meeting
of his caucus. Rae has also scheduled a news conference for twelve
thirty at which he's expected to discuss his future plans. 
<HR>

<H3>Bill 26 - Hamilton</H3>

<P>
Ontario's safety is in danger. That's the warning from fire fighters
and police at hearings into the province's bill 26. 
<P>
As it stands now, the cost cutting bill would allow towns and
cities to charge user fees for such things as police and fire
services. Annette Hamm has details from the hearings in Hamilton
today. 
<P>
<I>Imagine being charged a user fee if firefighters had to respond
to your emergency. The president of the Ontario Professional Firefighters
Association says it could happen unless changes are made to the
Harris government's bill 26. He cites a proposal by the City of
North York. </I>
<P>
<I>Police officers trying to avoid layoffs crowded the subcommittee
hearing. A delegation representing more than 23-thousand officers
and support staff warned the committee that more personnel is
the best tool in fighting crime. </I>
<P>
<I>Although the subcommittee will return to Hamilton next Friday
to deal with health concerns, both Liberal and NDP MPP's complain
the hearing is moving too far too fast. </I>
<P>
<I>The hearings have to wrap up before the legislature votes on
bill 26 January 29th. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton, Annette Hamm, Channel 11 News. </I>

late yesterday morning. 
<HR>

<H3>Cop Shooting </H3>

<P>
The special investigations unit says a sword was found where a
police officer fatally shot an unidentified man in Toronto last
night. 
<P>
The SIU says two officers were on an unrelated call when they
saw a man standing on the road holding a sword. 
<P>
Witnesses say the man was approached and ordered to drop the sword...
but instead threatened officers with it. He was shot when he got
within a few metres of them. 
<HR>

<H3>Tweed Murder Arrest</H3>

<P>
A Thornhill man who lives across the hall from an elderly couple
who were stabbed to death has been charged with their murders.

<P>
A Cambridge woman whose granddaughter died while she was attempting
to rid the child of evil spirits is going to jail. 
<P>
Forty-three-year- old Ana Maria Canhotto of Cambridge has been
sentenced to two years less a day. She told the court she believed
the devil killed the two-year old child as an act of vengeance.

<HR>

<H3>Subway Inquest 4 </H3>

<P>
A physician from Sunnybrook Health Science Centre in Toronto says
if he had been called earlier, he might have been able to save
one of the victims of last August's subway crash in Toronto which
claimed three lives. 
<P>
Doctor Andrew McCallum told a coroner's inquest into the crash
today that he attempted to save a 22-year-old woman whose legs
were pinned under a huge chunk of metal. He amputated her leg
with a fireman's saw at the scene. She died later. 
<P>
He also said rescuers faced horrific conditions in the tunnel
where the two trains collided, describing it as hot and dangerous
with wreckage everywhere. The inquest continues. 
<HR>

<H3>Hydro Firings </H3>

<P>
The Ontario government is being accused of trying to silence critical
thinking at Ontario Hydro by getting rid of eight members of Hydro's
board of directors. 
<HR>

<H3>Bill 26 Hearings </H3>

<P>
A traveling government roadshow on the controversial omnibus bill
stopped in Niagara falls today. 
<P>
Bill 26 would give Ontario's conservative government sweeping
new powers. Powers the government says it needs to reduce the
province's debt. While opponents are charging that the government
has gone too far, proponents say it hasn't gone far enough. Lauran
Sabourin has more in this report. 
<P>
<I>Conservative and pro bill 26 members on one side of the room.
Opposition members on the other. Listening to the few representatives
who managed to get on the agenda. </I>
<P>
<I>People who are recommending changes to the controversial legislation.
Peter Kormos rebel MPP and champion of the underprivileged got
under the skin of those in favor of the legislation. Legislation
better known as the bully bill. A reference to the fact not everyone
who wanted to make a presentation was not on the list. the government's
justification for bill 26 is that the amendments will help it
reduce the province's staggering debt. But to the opponents that
debt is being reduced on the backs of those who can least afford
to pay.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Agostino-Gas Tax?</H3>

<P>
No municipal gas tax. That assurance comes from the Harris government;
which has stated publicly, that it will close any loopholes in
its proposed jumbo bill, that might allow cities to use the legislation
to charge municipal taxes on items like gasoline. 
<P>
But that promise did not stop Hamilton East MPP Dominic Agostino,
from going on the offensive, today. Agostino insists, that the
tax will happen; and in fact, handed out leaflets denouncing the
&quot;Mike Harris gas tax: at an east end Hamilton gas station&quot;.
<P>
The provincial panel conducting public hearings on the jumbo bill
convenes in Hamilton, tomorrow.

<H3>French/Mahaffy Fund </H3>

<P>
A powerful, and emotional appeal for financial assistance; featuring
super-model Linda Evangelista... was issued today by supporters
of the families of Leslie Mahaffy, and Kristen French. 
<P>
The French-Mahaffy Legal Assistance Fund; is looking for public
support to continue a legal battle over controversial videotapes,
shown to jurors at the Paul Bernardo trial. Scot Urquhart takes
a look, at this unusual case: 
<P>
<I>The battle is over ... but the war, goes on: but wait a minute
... those tapes have already been sealed by the court; so what
is the purpose, of the fund? </I>
<P>
<I>So, the legal assistance fund is trying to prevent that development;
at any cost: a target that will mount a court case to keep the
sealed records, sealed.</I>
<P>
<I>Jeff Manishen is a noted criminal lawyer. But no matter how
long the odds ... the families of Kristen and Leslie are determined
to ensure that their worst emotional nightmare never comes to
pass.</I>
<P>
<I>In Burlington Scot Urquhart Channel Eleven News.</I>
<HR>

<H3>PST/GST</H3>

<P>
Remember the 1993 election when Prime Minister Chretien promised
to scrap the GST? Well, that day has not yet come...but there
is much talk about taxes. 
<P>
On a trade mission with Chretien, Premier Mike Harris says Ontario
may be close to harmonizing the provincial sales tax with the
federal GST. Marci Ien reports from Queens Park. 
<P>
<I>When Canadian cash registers ring up sales ...there may soon
be no more separate provincial and federal sales taxes added to
the bill. Word from Premier Harris ...who is on an Asian trade
mission with Prime Minister Chretien...is that Ontario may be
close to harmonizing the provincial sales tax with the federal
GST. </I>
<P>
<I>Liberal MPP Monte Kwinter says the move is a positive one ...as
long as Ontario taxpayers don't pay a price. </I>
<P>
<I>Finance Minister Ernie Eves was cautiously optimistic. He says
talks about merging the taxes are still ongoing. </I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Marci Ien, Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Hearings</H3>

<P>
Meanwhile... legislators listening to public input on the Harris
government's controversial jumbo bill refused to extend hearings
at their Kitchener whistle stop today. So some of the dozen or
so groups waiting for their kick at the can went unheard. 
<HR>

<H3>Subway Inquest 3</H3>

<P>
New Toronto subway trains will be equipped with speedometers,
says police Staff Sergeant Alan Staples, who testified at the
inquest into last summer's crash that killed three passengers.
The trains now in service don't have speedometers and drivers
must rely on experience and a system of lights to know how fast
they are going. 
<P>
But Staples says lack of speedometers wasn't the main cause of
the crash.
<HR>

<H3>Toronto Pot Bust</H3>

<P>
Just days after police stumbled onto a hydroponic marijuana farm
in Mount Hope, metro Toronto police have made a similar discovery.

<P>
After obtaining a search warrant for an unrelated matter, detectives
say they found a hydroponic lab in full swing in a North York
condominium. They seized the equipment and about 100 marijuana
plants. The plants alone are worth 30-thousand dollars. 
<P>
A North York man has been charged, but police haven't released
his name pending further investigation. 
<HR>

<H3>Judge Suspended </H3>

<P>
Quebec judge Jean Bienvenue has been suspended pending an investigation
into remarks he made from the bench, while sentencing a woman
to a prison term for killing her husband. The judge likened the
victim's suffering to that of Jews during the holocaust, and said
women can sink to lower levels than men. 
<P>
He later apologized... but refused to resign, prompting a review
by the Canadian Judicial Council. 
<HR>

<H3>Credit Card Scam </H3>

<P>
A Toronto man faces 120 fraud related charges in connection with
a quarter- million-dollar bogus credit card scam, uncovered during
a nine month investigation by three police forces and the Canadian
Bankers Association. 
<P>
Police say the names and personal information of people answering
a newspaper job ad was used to obtain credit cards which would
be run up to the limit and then destroyed. 
<P>
Charged is 48- year-old Alexander Polychronopoulos of Toronto.

<H3>OPSEU Strike Looms</H3>

<P>
Ontario's civil service union is threatening to shut-down the
province. The union has been negotiating with the Harris government
for over a year on its current contract. 
<HR>

<H3>Anarchy Clip</H3>

<P>
A new survey reveals that today's youth... members of so- called
generation &quot;x&quot;... are twice as likely to cheat on their
taxes as other Canadians. What's more... they believe those who
pay in full are fools. 
<HR>

<H3>Trade Trip</H3>

<P>
Prime Minister Jean Chretien along with seven provincial premiers
and more than 300 Canadian business people are in Bombay, India,
tonight. 
<P>
The visit is part of a week and a half long Asian trade mission,
expected to generate more than two billion dollars in business
for Canada. 
<P>
Analysts say it's also about boosting Chretien's public image.
But the plan could backfire if human rights issues are ignored.

<HR>

<H3>Mourning Mitterand </H3>

<P>
Governor-General Romeo Leblanc and Deputy Prime Minister Sheila
Copps are en route to Paris tonight where they'll represent Canada
at Thursday's memorial service for former president Francois Mitterand.
They will join Foreign Affairs Minister Andr&eacute; Ouellet,
already in Paris on business. 
<P>
Mitterand died in his sleep yesterday... eight months after leaving
office. He was suffering from prostate cancer. France's longest-serving
president was 79. 
<HR>

<H3>Toronto Mugging </H3>

<P>
A 37 year old man is recovering in hospital after a mugging in
downtown Toronto this afternoon. 
<P>
The victim had his wallet stolen and collapsed after he ran to
a parking attendant for help. The man had no vital signs when
the police arrived. Paramedics revived the man. 
<P>
The suspect is still at large. 
<HR>

<H3>Subway Inquest </H3>

<P>
The rookie driver of a Toronto subway train involved in a fatal
crash needed to rely on experience to know how fast he was going
because the trains don't have speedometers, an inquest was told
today. 
<P>
The inquest into the subway accident last Aug. 11 that killed
three passengers has been told that driver Robert Jeffrey was
behind the wheel for two days when he ran three red lights. 
<P>
Yesterday, jurors heard there were warnings about flaws in the
Toronto subway system three months before a fatal crash. But the
consultants who issued the warnings were fired before senior managers
read their reports. 
<HR>

<H3>Blizzard </H3>

<P>
In Newfoundland today... schools, government offices and businesses
remained closed while remnants of the blizzard of '96 swept across
the Avalon and Bonavista peninsulas. And much of the American
east coast is still bogged down after this week's storm. 
<P>
Authorities say it could be days before all the streets are plowed,
and airline flights are back to normal. the storm is blamed for
the deaths of at least 80 people in the US. 
<HR>

<H3>Anemia - Blood </H3>

<P>
Every year, 300-thousand Canadians require blood transfusions
either to prevent anemia or to treat it. But there may be new
hope. Canadian researchers say a new therapy called E-prex may
put an end to blood transfusions for many cancer patients. Marci
Ien explains. 
<P>
<I>Harvey Wayne is a cancer patient...and like most cancer patients
who undergo chemotherapy ...blood transfusions had become a way
of life. ...a way to combat anemia...a condition that is more
likely to occur if a patient is being treated with chemotherapy.
</I>
<P>
<I>Chemotherapy does more than destroy cancer cells... it also
wipes out red blood cells ...the ones that carry life-giving oxygen
to the body. That's where E-prex comes in. The drug is a genetically-
engineered version of the same hormone that stimulates red blood
cell production in human bone marrow. In essence ...E-prex gives
red blood cells a kick-start...and that's good news at a time
when people are worried about the safety of the blood system.
</I>
<P>
<I>E-prex has been used to treat kidney dialysis patients who
suffer dangerous anemia for several years. It's hoped by next
year...the drug will allow elective surgery patients of forego
transfusions. </I>
<P>

<H3>U.S. Travel</H3>

<P>
One of the worst blizzards of the century have paralyzed much
of the eastern United States, with eight states declaring a state
of emergency. 
<P>
Record snowfalls have stranded thousands of travelers and closed
down businesses and governments. 
<P>
Meanwhile, on this side of the border, phones at travel clubs
are ringing off the hook with would-be tourists looking for updates
on road conditions. Marci Ien reports. 
<P>
<I>They're calling it the blizzard of '96. The worst snow storm
to sweep the northeastern U.S. in over 70 years. </I>
<P>
<I>The blizzard has dumped over 70 centimetres of snow in some
areas--shutting down schools and businesses. </I>
<P>
<I>At least 23 people have died in the storm including two Canadians
killed in separate accidents in Kentucky. </I>
<P>
<I>Major airports in many U.S. cities are closed ...causing big
headaches for travelers... including this basketball team from
McGill University in Montreal. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton, Marci Ien, Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>U.S. Travel Tag</H3>

<P>
And again you are advised to keep off the roads leading south...but
if you find yourself out there ...travel expert Dave Hunter says
the I-75 is your best bet because there are plenty of reasonable
motels along the route in case of emergency. 
<HR>

<H3>Snow Bound</H3>

<P>
A Guelph University student and a pal from Brock University say
they're lucky to be alive today. 
<P>
The two got lost while on a skiing holiday in Vermont... and spent
a bone-chilling night on top of a mountain.
<HR>

<H3>Canhotto Sentence</H3>

<P>
A Cambridge woman will return to court on Wednesday to be sentenced
in the death of her 2-year-old grand- daughter. 
<P>
43-year-old Anna Marie Canhotto has pleaded guilty to manslaughter
in the death of Kiro Canhotto last January. The child died during
a ritual in which she was force fed water to rid her of the devil.

<P>
Three others were charged in the case, including the girl's mother,
who will be sentenced later this year. 
<HR>

<H3>York Region Body</H3>

<P>
Police are still searching for the killer of a York Region baker
found shot to death in his mini-van. 
<P>
The body of Frank Loiero was found riddled with bullets in the
parking lot of a mall in Woodbridge, northwest of Toronto. Police
say he was visiting a relative last night when he took a phone
call around 7:30 and went outside. A short while later he was
found dead. 
<HR>

<H3>Subway Inquest</H3>

<P>
Last summer's deadly subway accident in Toronto was the result
of failure at many levels says Crown Attorney Chris Punter. He
told an inquest into the crash that the transit control centre
had little or no control over trains in the tunnel... and despite
reports of a faulty signal throughout the day the device was never
fixed. 
<P>
An internal TTC report says driver Robert Jeffrey went through
three red lights before the accident. Punter says the inquest
will focus on the tendency of some drivers to &quot;cheat the
system&quot; in order to keep their trains on schedule. 
<HR>

<H3>College Scabs</H3>

<P>
A Toronto visa school for international students ,has locked out
its teachers in a contract dispute, and hired replacements. Its
the first incident of such action since new labor laws went into
effect in Ontario. 
<HR>

<H3>Bosnia-Mission</H3>

<P>
Canadian soldiers are going to Bosnia armed with a list of do's
and don'ts. They have been issued a small card detailing the rules
of engagement, including a reminder to soldiers that the torture
of civilians is not allowed. This time, Canada's military doesn't
want to take any chances.

<P>Master Control is the broadcast centre of CHCH-TV.  It is here
that  programs are integrated with commercials and formated into a
complete  broadcast schedule.

<P>Master Control is built around  an audio/video switcher which allows
for  smooth transitions between an array of video sources, both inside
the  station, across the region via microwave, and around the world via 
satellite.  A computerized system of integrating commercial and program
playbacks is linked to a Sony LMS (Library Management System) (pictured
above), which executes seamless playbacks from four self-contained
videotape machines... offering instant access to over 1000 audio/video
elements.

<TITLE>Steve Lambert Biography</TITLE>

<H1><CENTER>Steve Lambert</CENTER></H1>
<HR>

<P>
I have been a resident of the hallowed halls of CHCH for eighteeen
years. It is true when they say time goes fast when you're having
fun. I came to CHCH in 1977 after completing the three year Television
Broadcasting course at Mohawk College here in Hamilton. After
spending a year in the Props Department I took a position in the
Videotape Department which involved running on-air programming
and various stories for the newscasts. January, 1983 marked my
transition to becoming a film and videotape &quot;Screener&quot;
where I learned to edit shows and movies and first noticed my
hair was going a little grey!
<P>
A job opening in Program Promotion in September of 1986 catapulted
me into a whole new creative environment. Along with producing
and scheduling the daily on-air promotional spots, each year I
helped write and produce our Fall Sales Presentation, which highlights
the upcoming seasons' programming. In September, 1994, with a
few more grey hairs intact, I moved over to Commercial Production
and have found the many new challenges to be quite rewarding.
<P>
During my time here at CHCH, I have also been involved with C.A.B.E.,
the Canadian Association of Broadcast Employees, the internal
employee association, and am currently serving my third term as
Vice-President. As for the future, I, like you, am &quot;staying
tuned...&quot;<HR>

<HR>

<P>
He asked me to write a &quot;bio&quot; for our web site.
<P>
&quot;On who?&quot; I asked.
<P>
&quot;On you&quot; He replied.
<P>
&quot;On me?... OK&quot; I said, &quot;but I refuse to write in
the third person, it's like writing an obituary.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Just do it the way you want&quot; was the reply, &quot;and
don't be afraid to toot your horn!&quot;
<P>
&quot;Cool&quot; I thought, &quot;Stay tuned for horn tooting&quot;
<P>
I've been involved in the commercial production industry ever
since 1986. That's when I emerged from Humber College's three
year film and television production program. I was ready to take
on the world, unfortunately, I was also dirt poor and desperate
for a job. The Partners Film Company gave me that first break.
After working there for almost three years, having gone from truck
driver to assistant editor, I came to the conclusion that I had
to do my own thing.
<P>
That flash of self analytical insight brought me to the CBC Windsor.
Management felt I could revitalize their commercials and on-air
look. However, events conspired against us... budget cutbacks
deemed the entire Windsor operation redundant and we were all
out of work just three months later. C'est la vie at the CBC.
<P>
What was CBC's loss was CHCH's gain. I started here in 1991, and
immediately became the catalyst that landed some of the most exciting
and important commercial accounts to date. Since then I've continued
to write, direct and produce a wide variety of projects ranging
from commercials to on air promotions and corporate videos. Along
the way I've amassed an extensive collection of awards and gained
a reputation as one of Hamilton's leading television advertising
creative forces. So, If you're talking commercial production in
Hamilton, you're talking to me... sooner or later, preferably
sooner. <HR>

<TITLE>"Patsy!" A Musical Tribute to Patsy Cline</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<CENTER><H1>About The Show</H1></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
Patsy Cline's 5 song legacy of <I>She's Got You</i>, <I>Crazy</I>, <I>Sweet Dreams</I>, <I>I Fall To Pieces</I> and <I>Walkin' After Midnight</I> has been called the greatest in the history of Country Music.  These 5 classics form the core of the 22 songs around which <B>Patsy!</B> is built.  The 2 hour show features an outstanding six piece band, a quartet of backing vocalists and, of course, Patsy, all live on stage as her dramatic life and phenomenal career are traced from the Honky Tonks of Virginia to the Grand Ole Opry, Las Vegas and Carnegie Hall.  Some very funny comedy is thrown in to the mix to ensure a memorable evening at the theatre.
<P>
<B>Patsy!</B> was honoured on November 5, 1995 with three major awards in Branson, Missouri... Best New Musical, Best New Female Performer (Gail Bliss as Patsy) and Best Backup Vocal Group.  The show ran 10 months in Boston, 6 months in Kansas City, toured to sold out houses in 75 U.S. cities and just wrapped up an 8 month stint at Branson's 4,000 seat Grande Palace Theatre.
<P>
We're sure you'll agree that <B>Patsy!</B> is also destined to be a monster hit in Nashville North (otherwise known as Toronto).

<H1>Patsy Cline</H1>

</CENTER>

<HR>

<P>
During a recording career that spanned only about six years, Patsy
Cline built a body of work that stands alone among country and
pop singers. Her country background filled her music with heartfelt
emotion while her impeccable vocal control and Owen Bradley's
elegant production broke down all the barriers between country
and pop music.  She was one of the most popular singers of her
time, and today, more than 30 years after her death, she is still
one of the most popular recording artists.
<P>
Patsy Cline's music has never gone out of style, as evidenced
by the 15 albums still available from MCA - more than any other
MCA Nashville artist.  Ever since the 1985 movie about her life,
starring Jessica Lange, Cline has been among the top-selling artists
on the label.  Her &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album was certified
gold in 1985, platinum in 1987, double platinum in 1989 and triple
platinum in 1991 with actual sales surpassing 3.5 million pieces.
<P>
Patsy Cline was born Virginia Patterson Hensely on September 8,
1932, in Gore, Virginia.  Her family moved to Winchester, about
50 miles away, when she was in grammar school.  As a teenager,
she began singing with country bands on the radio and in local
clubs.  At the age of 16, she made her first trip to Nashville
to audition for the Grand Ole Opry.
<P>
In the early 1950s, a bandleader suggested she use a different
first name, and she adapted her middle name to Patsy.  Her last
name came from Gerald Cline, to whom she was married from 1953-57.
 As Patsy Cline, she was signed by Four Star Records in 1954.
 A distribution deal with Decca led to her first recordings with
legendary producer Owen Bradley in 1955.
<P>
In 1956, Cline joined the cast of the &quot;Town and Country Time&quot;
radio show in Washington D.C., which was hosted by Jimmy Dean.
 Early in 1957, she became an overnight sensation.  She appeared
on Arthur Godfrey's &quot;Talent Scouts,&quot; a network television
program, and Decca released <I>Walkin' After Midnight</I>.  Ironically,
she had fought against recording the song, feeling it was not
country enough.  By March in 1957, it was a country smash and
#12 on the pop charts.  Her personal life also took a sharp turn
in 1957, as she divorced Gerald Cline, and married Charlie Dick.
<P>
Cline's chart success sputtered a bit after <I> Walkin' After
Midnight</I>, until she left Four Star and signed directly with
Decca in 1960.  Her subsequent recordings have become pop as well
as country classics, including <I>I Fall To Pieces </I>(#12 pop)
and <I>Crazy</I> (#9 pop) in 1961 and <I>She's Got You</I> (#14
pop) in 1962.
<P>
On March 5, 1963, one month after the day she recorded <I>Sweet
Dreams</I>, Patsy Cline was killed in a plane crash.  She had
performed at a benefit in Kansas City the night before.  Along
with fellow country stars Lloyd &quot;Cowboy&quot; Copas and Hawkshaw
Hawkins, she was flying back to Nashville in a private plane piloted
by her manager Randy Hughes.  After a refuelling stop in Dyersberg,
TN., the plane encountered bad weather and crashed, killing all
aboard.
<P>
Patsy Cline's music continued to grow in popularity after her
death.  Album sales averaged 75,000 per year through the 1960s
and 1970s.  Sales increased after her role in Loretta Lynn's career
was dramatized in the 1980 movie &quot;Coal Miner's Daughter&quot;
(with Beverly D'Angelo playing Cline).  In the early 1980's, producer
Owen Bradley used modern technology to merge Cline's vocals into
a successful duet with Jim Reeves, who dies in a plane crash in
1964.  In 1985, her original recordings created some stunning
moments in &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, the film story of her recording
career, and her marriage to Charlie Dick.

<P>
The Queen Elizabeth Theatre seats 1,309 people with 936 Orchestra Seats and 373 Mezzanine Seats.  Sightlines are excellent with the Mezzanine not overhanging the Orchestra Section but rather being a raised section at the back of the theatre.  Legroom is very generous and the refurbished seats are wide and extremely comfortable.
<P>
The Theatre is fully air conditioned and fully wheelchair accessible.  Acoustics are excellent.  There is a 450 seat restaurant on the second floor of the Theatre which is accessible both by a sweeping marble staircase from the Lobby, and by elevator.

<H1><CENTER>Canada Caption Inc.</CENTER></H1>
<HR>

<H3><CENTER>Model Corporate Citizen: &quot;a lean, mean, non-bureaucratic
machine.&quot;</CENTER> </H3>

<P>
At Canada Caption Incorporated (CCI), the three-and-a-half year
old organization dedicated to increasing the amount and improving
the quality of  captioning in Canada, the working vocabulary is
noticeably different from that of other charitable and non-profit
organizations.  Words like innovation, flexibility, entrepreneurial
and aggressive - more often the jargon of Fortune 500 enterprises
- are not just part of the CCI lexicon; they're part of every
day practice and cutting-edge achievement.
<P>
Established on January 1, 1992 by Executive Director <A HREF="beverley.htm">Beverly Ostafichuk</A>,
CCI began recruiting finical support to help underwrite the costs
of captioning in Canadian programming.  It negotiated with broadcasters
and captioning facilities to ensure the highest quality service
for captioning users and advanced the image of its corporation
sponsors using billboard overlays for on-air recognition across
the entire viewing audience.
<P>
Today, the Oakville Ontario based CCI is well on its way towards
achieving its goal of 100% captioning on Canadian programming
by the year 2000.
<P>
Captioning has always been squeezed inside a fiscally-boundaried
catch-22: the only way to bring down the cost of captioning is
to increase the volume of captioning, and the only way to increase
volume is to break down the cost.  CCI attacks the problem and
finds economically viable solutions that not only work to the
advantage of the deaf and hard of hearing community (who receive
more and better captioned programs) also benefit corporate sponsors
(who receive partial tax receipts for financial support and recognition
as involved and responsible corporate citizens) and not the largest
captioning subcontractor in the country and its high volumes mean
greater savings, all of which pushes them closer to fulfilling
their mandate. 
<P>
As captioning costs become more reasonable and broadcasters bring
such activities in-house, CCI's role will undoubtedly change.
 Ostafichuk and the rest of the forward-thinking staff are already
planning the next evolution of CCI.  In keeping with their proactive
approach, they are at the forefront of technological innovation
in the captioning industry.
<P>
Through Captioning Awareness Week and through their everyday battles
and triumphs, CCI is expanding the captioning market to benefit
all users.  In addition to the deaf and hard of hearing, captioning
will benefit senior citizens, young children learning to read,
and adult learners as well.  CCI is working to publicize the proven
advantages of captioning to further increase demand, decrease
the cost and increase the accessibility of captioning.  In other
words,  CCI is taking entrepreneurial means towards charitable
ends.
<P>
In the past, a few organizations have monopolized the captioning
industry and hoarded information - not to mention profits - to
the disadvantage of the deaf and hard of hearing.  Ostafichuk
is determined to wipe out those monopolies and the only way to
do so it to compete on a level playing field with an unending
supply of creative ideas and professionalism.
<P>
&quot;We have to constantly stay ahead of the status quo, constantly
re-evaluate our business plan,&quot; she say. &quot;I don't think
that kind of entrepreneurial thinking exists in charities.&quot;
<P>
It is that entrepreneurial model that has attracted world-wide
attention and which Ostafichuk is hoping to export, &quot;especially
to developing countries where illiteracy is high.&quot;  Ostafichuk
has been invited to numerous international conferences to speak
about the CCI model and how it may be applied.  &quot; I talk
to anyone who will listen&quot; she says.  &quot;I try to convince
people that you have to communicate on the same level as big corporations.
 You can't go in with a pity-me attitude.  If you have a plan
and the statistics, it can be done.&quot;<HR>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<H1><CENTER>LOBCO Inc.</CENTER></H1>
<HR>

<H3><CENTER>To Be Seen Is To Be Heard</CENTER> </H3>

<P>
 
<P>
Established in 1990, LOBCO Inc. enjoys diverse corporate activity
which, in itself, is its most outstanding quality.  It is an organization
which has no template to follow.  Every accomplishment represents
precedent setting work and original thought.
<P>
As a consultant, LOBCO Inc. works with television broadcasts in
implementing operations policy and procedures related to social
issues.  CanWest Global, Baton Broadcasting and CBC are just a
few of the many institutions LOBCO Inc. works with to ensure positive
feedback from consumer groups, government and other authorities
that may influence issues from time to time.
<P>
Its efforts with Rogers Cablesystems in creating a Closed Caption
decoder program has allowed potentially 20,000 deaf, deafened
and hard of hearing people access to closed captioned programming.
 The framework for this decoder program has been utilized by most
cable operators across Canada.
<P>
LOBCO Inc. created <A HREF="cci.htm">Canada Caption Inc.</A>, a charitable organization
dedicated to finding funds for the closed captioning of Canadian
programming.  As an entrepreneurial charity, its business strategy
is based on a win/win scenario that has proven very successful.
<P>
In creating <A HREF="cci.htm">Canada Caption Inc.</A>, LOBCO Inc. established a network
of corporate sponsors allowing the company to caption over 2500
hours of Canadian programming in 1995.
<P>
Research is a quality for which LOBCO Inc. is noted.  Its expertise
in the area of captioning has been called upon for two major research
undertakings.  LOBCO Inc. has provided its expertise in the area
of Canadian captioning to table &quot;The Monitor Project&quot;
and &quot;Key Issues in Canadian Captioning&quot; in association
with the Canadian Captioning Development Agency, and The Department
of Communications, now called The Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
Its recommendations are now becoming guidelines for industry standards.
<P>
In conjunction with Sheridan College and <A HREF="cci.htm">Canada Caption Inc.</A>,
LOBCO Inc. completed an in-depth study on the effects of captioning
on language acquisition for English as a second language learners.
 Like the previous study, this project will set a new precedent,
influencing English as a second language curriculum for future
learners across Canada.
<P>
As LOBCO Inc. creates bonds in its client base and mirrors the
diversification of the industries it represents, it is charged
with highly motivated result oriented human resources.
<P>
Its method of establishing a strategy and following it through
is LOBCO Inc.'s calling card.  It prides itself in successfully
competing the work it sets out to do.
<P>
Beverley Ostafichuk, founder and President of LOBCO Inc. has an
entrepreneurial spirit that is the driving force behind LOBCO
Inc.'s success.  Ever the optimist, LOBCO Inc. believes in creating
opportunity where none existed.<HR>

<HR>

<H3><CENTER>Breaking through barriers and captioning the future</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Captioning is a time consuming expensive process.  It takes eight
to sixteen times the video time to fully caption a program.  As
a result there are few captioned programs and those that are captioned
are done poorly.  
<P>
 
<P>
VoiceWriterTM is a closed captioning, non-linear application that
increases productivity by 50% with a significant long term reduction
in cost.  This application has been Beta Tested by the closed
captioning professionals and meets all of the industry's requirements.
<P>
It is a MS Windows based application which is tightly coupled
with the hardware.  The GUI (Graphical User Interface) allows
caption editors to create captions with the use of  the keyboard,
mouse and voice recognition.  
<P>
Voice recognition allows the end user to navigate and dictate
within VoiceWriterTM.  It is speaker independent and allows end
users to fine-tune or create voice driven commands or text.
<P>
What's unique about VoiceWriterTM is the fact that it is the only
voice recognition captioning system available today.  This disk
based captioning system gives the captioner the ability to quickly
access the location of the text that is required.
<P>
Meeting all FCC regulations, the system follows the EIA-608 recommended
practice for line 21 data service in NTSC and PAL environments.
 For added simplicity the VoiceWriterTM style guide gives Captioning
Editors an On-line reference for industry captioning standards.
<P>
With continued research and development VoiceWriterTM's target
date is September 1, 1996 for real-time captioning with continuous
voice recognition.  
<P>
As a result of the evolving technology the CRTC (Canadian Radio
and Television Commission) issued a mandate (1995-48) requiring
every broadcaster in Canada billing over 10 million dollars per
year to caption all live news programming by September 1, 1998
and 90% of all programming by their next licence renewal.  
<P>
The technology is available today for broadcasters to caption
100% of their programming.   With VoiceWriterTM the target can
be met by 1996.

<TITLE>The Caption Clearinghouse</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<H1><CENTER>The Caption Clearinghouse</CENTER></H1>
<HR>

<H3><CENTER>Always better the second time around</CENTER> </H3>

<P>
The Caption Clearinghouse is a provider of second-run closed captioning
to Canadian and International Broadcasters.  It archives the accumulated
captions for programs that have already been aired and are now
being purchased by alternate broadcasters for rebroadcast.  The
master copies of these programs are not captioned and as a result
the acquiring broadcaster must seek out the captions independently.
<P>
The Caption Clearinghouse acts as a library, compiling captions
and providing them to broadcasters making it much simpler and
less expensive for broadcasters to acquire the captions.  If the
requested captions are not on file, The Caption Clearinghouse
will undertake the job of searching for and retrieving the captions
on behalf of the broadcaster.  The Caption Clearinghouse acts
as a clearinghouse for all second-run captions and undertakes
searches for international captions.  Most second-run captions
will be readily available making it cheaper and less time consuming
for broadcasters to caption second-run programming.  This will
leave the broadcasters captioning budget intact allowing them
to use these funds to caption programs that have not previously
been captioned.
<P>
The Caption Clearinghouse is also a library of reports, studies
and any evaluative documentation that has been done in relation
to closed captioning.  The Caption Clearinghouse compiles information
related to captioning for the deaf and hard of hearing as well
as alternative uses for captioning as in English as a Second Language
(ESL), and literacy applications.  It is a lending library of
these resource materials to reference libraries and interested
organizations internationally.
<P>
The Caption Clearinghouse also provides volume discount rates
for both offline and online captioning without compromise of captioning
quality.
<P>
The Caption Clearinghouse is a self-sustaining entity, operated
on a non-profit basis.  Any revenue generated distributing second-run
captions or brokering captions will only support the operational
overhead and staffing requirements of the Caption Clearinghouse.
<P>
Summary of Benefits
<UL>
<LI>Broadcasters are able to retrieve captions easily and in little
time, with one phone call.
<LI>The captions are provided at a reduced cost and in a timely
manner;
<LI>Lower costs result in more programs being closed captioned;
<LI>Centralized library will make information known and accessible
to all interested organizations.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
There is no charge to deposit your captions at The Caption Clearinghouse,
and the integrity of the captions will remain intact indefinitely
.
<P>

<H1><CENTER>Glossary of Captioning Terms</CENTER></H1>
<HR>

<UL>
<LI><B>Autoscroll - </B>A message set to be displaced over and
over again at a specific speed (i.e. a brief overview of an emergency
situation) until a Real-time captioner can be brought online
<LI><B>Caption</B> - The explanatory comment or designation accompanying
any pictorial illustration.  Designed specifically for the deaf
and hard of hearing, a caption explains both dialogue and relevant
sounds.
<LI><B>Captioned Program</B> - A program in which the audio portion
is translated into visual cues, rendering the program more meaningfully
to the targeted audience.
<LI><B>Decoder</B> - A device used to recover the component signals
from a composite (encoded) video source.
<LI><B>Closed Captioning</B> - Captions are hidden in the broadcast
signal and require some type of decoding circuitry to access them.
<LI><B>Electronic Note Taking</B> - Captioning that is done using
the computer keyboard rather than a steno keyboard which consists
of a summary of broadcast events dialogue rather than a verbatim
record.  Typically only used when a real-time-time captioner is
unavailable or not feasible, i.e. at a business meeting.
<LI><B>Encoder</B> - A device that processes one or more input
signals into a specified form for transmission and/or storage.
<LI><B>Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</B> - The federal
agency empowered by law regulate all interstate radio and wireline
communications services originating in the United States.
<LI><B>Line 21</B> - In order to accurately reproduce a scene,
the scanning must be done in an organized manner.  In both the
camera and television receiver, the scanning of target or screen
is done by an electron beam moving in horizontal lines across
the target plate or screen.  At the same time the horizontal beam
gradually moves down the screen.  When the beam reaches the bottom
of the screen, it is sent back to the top to continue scanning.
 There are 525 (NTSC) horizontal lines in the complete picture.
 The 21st horizontal line is referred to as Line 21.
<LI><B>Live Display</B> - Captioning prepared in advance, as a
script which is hand fed during live event or broadcast.  May
include formatting information but not timing information, and
the captioner can rearrange the order of the captions at will.
 
<LI><B>National Television Systems Committee (NTSC)</B> - The
North American broadcast television standard since 1953 , using
a 525 line composite colour television system.
<LI><B>Offline Captioning</B> - Captions added to a videotape
after it is produced by before it is aired or distributed.  Off-line
captioning systems use time codes to synchronize captions to the
tape and precisely place captions.
<LI><B>Online Captioning</B> - Online captioning is performed
&quot;live&quot; during an event or broadcast.  Online captioning
may be a combination of real-time, live-display, autoscroll and
electronic notetaking.
<LI><B>Open Captioning</B> - Open Captions are captions which
are not hidden in the broadcast signal and therefore, do not require
decoding circuitry in order to be seen.
<LI><B>Phase Alternating Line (PAL)</B> - The broadcasting standard
of the UK, New Zealand, Australia, Europe and the  Indian sub-continent,
using a 625 line, 50 field composite colour television system
derived from the NTSC system. PAL-M is the PAL sub-system used
in South America which is not compatible with PAL elsewhere.
<LI><B>Paint-on</B> - Paint-on is a style of displaying captions
in which the caption appears on the screen letter by letter as
if it were being painted on to the video frame.
<LI><B>Pop-on</B> - Pop-on is a style of displaying captions in
which the caption is quickly displayed on the screen.
<LI><B>Real-time Captioning</B> - Captions written live by a stenocaptioner
using a stenotype keyboard.
<LI><B>ReCap(TM)</B> - Captioning conversion technology which
enables captions created in the PAL/SECAM television broadcast
standards to be decoded, saved and re-encoded during conversation
to the NTSC television broadcast format and vice versa.
<LI><B>Roll-up</B> - Two, three or four lines of text that &quot;scroll&quot;
upward.  New words are added on the bottom line, as it fills up,
all the lines slide up to make room for the next.
<LI><B>System Electronique Couleur Avec Memoire (SECAM)</B> -
The broadcasting standard used in France since 1960, using 625
lines and 50 fields.  Gradually being phased out in favour of
PAL.
<LI><B>SMPTE</B> - A timecode format that conforms to SMPTE standards.
 SMPTE timecode consists of an 8-digit number specifying hours,
minutes, seconds, and frames.  Each number identifies one frame
on the video. 
<LI><B>Timecode</B> - A standardized numeric coding convention
used to uniquely identify segments of video by numbering each
sequential frame.
<LI><B>Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI)</B> - This is the blanking
portion at the beginning of each video field.  The VBI contains
equalizing pulses, vertical sync pulses and vertical interval
test signal (VITS).
<LI><B>Video Tape Recorder</B> - A device that permits audio and
video signals to be recorded on to magnetic tape.

Nestled in the heart of British Columbia, &quot;The Okanagan's Very Own CHBC&quot; 
coverage area stretches from the U.S. border to Revelstoke in the Rockies.  The region's
key urban centres include Kelowna, Vernon and Penticton.
<P>
CHBC is dedicated to a local perspective.  It is effective because the <I>CHBC News at 5:00</I>
has consistently delivered a share of over 50%.  CHBC's locally scheduled programming
outperforms the network by 3 to 1.  The commercial production department is one of the most award
winning in Canada.  Companies are flocking to the Corporate Video Division to have first rate
videos produced at very competitive prices.
<P>
The success of CHBC is built on the talents of motivated people committed to excellence in local 
television service.  The vision which sets us apart from the competition is that we are truly the
Okanagan's very own TV station.

<P>
The story of Lethbridge Television is in fact the story of 
television broadcasting in Southern Alberta.  CJLH TV as it 
was known then was the first TV station on the air south of 
Calgary, and it remains first in the hearts of many to this 
day.  It was November 20th, 1955 when the power switch was 
thrown, and Channel 7 - CJLH TV, a network affiliate of the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was officially on the air.  
Over the course of the next 40 years the station has assumed 
many changes in call letters.  From CJLH, we became CJOC, then 
CFAC, next was 2&7 Lethbridge and now we are known as 2&7 CISA. 
CISA was chosen to signify "Canadian Independent Southern Alberta".

BCTV's News Hour with Tony Parsons dominated British Columbia's
news wars once again in 1994. With close to 600,000 viewers daily,
News Hour is the most-watch local news program in Canada. The
station's newsroom produces 27 hours of programming, including
the country's first early-evening national news program, Canada
Tonight. BCTV's news department won six awards this year from
the Radio and Television News Directors Association, CanPro and
the British Columbia Association of Broadcasters for excellence
in news programming.

A new image campaign, innovative sales promotion initiatives,
increased emphasis on news and an intensified focus on commercial
production were key elements of ITV'S
strategy in fiscal 1994. Under the direction of Barry Duggan,
who was appointed President in January 1994, ITV introduced its
new image. All creative work on the logo and image was done inhouse
and post-production was provided by Studio Post &amp; Transfer.
ITV now produces 24.5 hours of live local news and sports each
week. A new set has been introduced and personnel added to increase
the station's already competitive position. ITV News is also offered
by Edmonton cable operator Videotron as part of the Videoway interactive
system. This system allows viewers to call up additional information
on a particular topic within the newscast. The Allarcom soundstage,
part of ITV's impressive studio facilities, was selected as the
production facility for filming of the interior scenes for the
series Destiny Ridge.

RDTV serves Central Alberta from the Rockies to Saskatchewan and, by cable, into Calgary and 
Edmonton.  In the last four years, RDTV has come from RDTV? to RDTV!  With a great cast of innovative
players, the station has swept CanPro for the last two years consecutively and has garnered other national
and international awards.
<P>
RDTV's production staff is constantly in demand from movie videos to bi-weekly satellite cattle auctions,
from award-winning commercials to rodeos.  RDTV's <I>Makin' 8</I> series of on-location shoots at rodeos 
has given the sport a new lease on life.  The series is in its third year and is now being courted internationally. 
RDTV's children's programming claims a large viewing audience throughout the province and an off-shoot
of that was the formation of the <I>Toon Crew Club</I> in 1994.  At 30,000 strong, its members are a force to
be reckoned with!

<P>
Canada's &quot;national family network&quot; experienced a 4 per
cent growth in the number of subscribers during fiscal 1994. The
Family Channel features high-quality entertainment with up to
60 per cent of programming coming from the Disney Channel; of
the remaining 40 per cent, 25 per cent is Canadian and 15 per
cent foreign.
<P>
The Family Channel's application for a national animation specialty
service entitled The Cartoon Network was denied by the CRTC. However,
the Family Channel may reapply in 1995 if and when, as has been
suggested, the CRTC calls for submissions for further licensing
of specialty channels.
<P>
Allarcom Pay Television owns 50 per cent of the Family Channel.

<P>
WIC's pay-per-view service offers audiences additional entertainment
choices in the comfort of their own homes. Home Theatre competes
with video rentals in both price and product, and beats the video
store hands-down in convenience. Home Theatre's multi-channel
service delivers movies that recently ended their theatrical releases,
and special events, such as boxing, wrestling and concerts, in
response to the viewer's phone-activated request.
<P>
Home Theatre is available to basic cable subscribers with addressable converter/decoders
provided by their cable company.
<P>
An average of 50 per cent of houses with access to Home Theatre
take advantage of the service, renting at least one movie every
month.

<P>
Q107, with its solidly focused music direction and innovative
marketing initiatives, has achieved strong ratings results, boasting
listenership in excess of 697,000 to remain firmly entrenched
as English Canada's No.1 rock station. The annual Q107 Rock Awards
took on a new dimension this year when the station combined with
WIC television station CHCH to produce a highlights show that
ran in the country's top three markets.
<P>
In October 1995, AM640 became the last of the Westcom AM stations to
make the switch to news, talk, sports and information programming.  AM640
is now known as &quot;Talk 640 - Toronto's Information Station&quot;.  Previously,
the teen-oriented AM640 had provided daytime talk programming, specifically
oriented to its younger audience.  Now, Talk 640 caters to a more mature listener
and features both local and national news, talk, sports and information programming,
24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week.

Pacific National Exhibition was initiated with the release of
the Canadian best-seller Top Dog, a history of CKNW written by
Vancouver author Chuck Davis. <BR>
Rock 101's Sportstalk show with Dan Russell continues to grow
in popularity. During the Vancouver Canuck's drive to the Stanley
Cup finals, Dan Russell traveled with the Canucks on road games
and broadcast Sportstalk live via satellite from the arena in
Calgary, Toronto, Dallas and New York.

</CENTER>

<HR>

<P>
<B>Rock 107</B> is the continuing evolution of Calgary's premiere rock station.  Even though
CKIK was the second rock FM station to sign on in Calgary, it has always been the trailblazer.  <B>Rock 107</B>
has had an eclectic heritage, ranging from its initial &quot;Ball to the Wall&quot; approach in the early 
80's, to its current hybrid New Rock/Rock format.  This format has been in place since March 1996.
<P>
<B>CKIK</B> signed on in 1982 as a hard rock station.  Its high level of community involvement and 
broadcasting standards have engendered uncommon loyalty among its core audience.  The radio station
supports, among other causes: The Sheriff King Home for Battered Women and Children, The Alberta Lung
Association, The Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation, and the United Way as well as many smaller 
community groups.
<P>
<B>Rock 107</B>'s on-air team is currently led by the morning tandem of Roger Rhodes and Spyder O'Neil, 
who are both ably assisted by Stew the Producer guy.
<P>
The mid-day is held down by 19 year veteran, and 7 year KIK-ster Paul Boucher.  The afternoon drive is taken 
care of by our import ringer, and Assistant Program Director, Carter Brown.  Zenon West, the longest serving KIK
announcer has been around - on and off - since the beginning in 1982, and he covers the evening scene in 
Calgary better than anyone else out there.
<P>
Our management staff, with the exception of Program Director, is shared with our sister AM station 
<A HREF="qr77.htm">QR 77</A>.
<P>
<B>Rock 107</B> also has one of the premiere radio station websites, run in-house by Paul Boucher with expert
outside assistance from Passageway Communications, and supplier Nucleus Information Service.

<HR>

<P>
Winnipeg's No. 1 station, CJOB, is known as &quot;Manitoba's Information
Station.&quot;  Repeatedly setting the day's agenda in news, weather,
sports, traffic and talk. From breaking news and sports stories,
to health care documentaries and senate petitions.
<P>
Classic Rock 97.5FM is the only radio station in the Winnipeg
market that has continually grown in the last six BBMs.  The station
boasts the highest share of male listeners aged 25 to 54 in Winnipeg.
 Promotions, from concerts to sporting events, further raised
the station's profile.  An outdoor campaign was developed to position
the radio station and inform Winnipeg of 97.5's mix of classic
rock and its strong on-air personalities.
<P>
CJOB and 97.5FM's involvement in the community was highlighted
by an all-out campaign for the United Way.  In one day, more than
$50,000 was raised.  Both radio stations continue to work with
the many worthy organizations in Winnipeg, through fundraising
and public service.  Some of the organizations that benefit are
the Heart &amp; Stroke Foundation, Christmas Cheer Board, Alzheimer
Society, Red Cross and Big Brothers.<HR>

<H2>1996 CCBE Convention</H2>

The 1996 CCBE Convention is the ideal opportunity to network and learn from your peers in the broadcast and video production industry.   Also, networking in the computer sense is an important aspect of broadcasting technology and you will have the opportunity to educate yourself in computer networking as well as a wide array of technical subjects at the convention.
<P>

The cost for the convention is extremely modest when compared to most other conventions that are presented in our area.   Early registration is $120.00 November 1st 1996 and $140.00 afterward.  Included in the cost is a Delegates Buffet , two breakfasts, several coffee breaks, a business luncheon, and the CCBE Awards Banquet. 
<P>

Also, by the time you read this, some lucky delegate will have won a A Winter Getaway trip to the value of $1500.00.
<P>
     The 1996 CCBE Convention, will be held on Saturday November 16th and Sunday 17th November 1996, at the Regal Constellation Hotel, 900 Dixon Road, Etobicoke, adjacent to Toronto International Airport.   
The theme of this year's convention is Exploring Broadcast Solutions.   

<P>
The broadcasting convention season is in full swing and by the time this is read at least two of them will have past into history.   The World Expo was held in Los Angeles, California, October 8 - 12, 1996    This convention is a combined effort of NAB Radio, the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), the Radio and Television News Directors Association (RTNDA)and the Society of Broadcast Engineers (SBE).   The CAB/WABE convention was held in Edmonton, Alberta, October 27 - 29, 1996.   I will report on these conventions in future newsletters.    
<P>

Next is the Spectrum 20/20 Dollar and $ense Conference that is sponsored by the Radio Advisory Board of Canada (RABC) and Industry Canada.    Spectrum 20/20 will be held at the Chateau Laurier in Ottawa November 20 & 21st 1996.   Spectrum, as a subject, does not sound like the material that makes an interesting conference.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when I attended my first Specrum 20/20 conference in Montreal several years ago. There, spectrum assignment in the L-Band was being discussed and with it Canada's entry into the Digital Audio Broadcasting era.   At another Spectrum 20/20 a speaker discussed an interesting little item like what happens to fibre optic cable during a nuclear attack.   I remember at the time discussing this little gem with Wayne Stacey and deciding the fate of fibre optic cable might be the least of our worries in such circumstances.
<P>

I tend to pick up items that might be of interest for the CCBE newsletter, some I use, others become dated and are discarded.  One such item was from the 1996  NAB.     A study was circulated in the newsroom to the effect that broadcasters' competitors have access to large blocks of "free" spectrum and shows that far from being a boring subject, spectrum assignment is not without controversy.   According to the study, common carriers have access to 10,000 Mhz, Cable 1500 Mhz, DBS 1000Mhz and broadcasters, 1600 broadcasting stations use only 402Mhz. 
<P>

I look forward to the November conference in Ottawa in order to keep up-to- date with spectrum issues in Canada.  
<P>

<H1>&quot;Sunset Beach&quot;</H1>
<H2>a sizzling new daytime drama from Aaron Spelling,</H2>
<H2>premieres January 6, 1997 on CHCH-TV.</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>
<I><B>Sunset Beach</B></I> is a place where everyone knows everybody
else's business.  It's home to the rich and poor, young and old,
warm beaches, casual charm and a legend that pervades the entire
character of the community.  <I><B>Sunset Beach,</B></I> the first
daytime serial to debut on television in eight years and Aaron
Spelling's first entry into the daytime arena, premieres <U>Monday,
January 6, 1997 (3:00 - 4:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<P>
The 21 member cast includes such names as veteran actress <B>Lesley-Anne
Down, Sam Behrens, Susan Ward, Clive Robertson, Leigh Taylor Young,
Kathleen Noone</B> and <B>Ashley Hamilton</B>.  <BR>

<P>
Set in a small Southern California coastal community, <I><B>Sunset
Beach </B></I>is comprised of a diverse mix of people: police
officers, lifeguards, newspaper reporters, doctors, waiters and
restaurant owners.  It has its share of interesting personalities
like the &quot;trophy&quot; wife of a high-powered, unscrupulous
attorney, who lusts after power and social status; a mysterious,
wealthy entrepreneur; an eccentric, personable socialite; a career-driven
physician; a good cop gone bad; an all-American hero with a tormented
past; a troubled young runaway; a conniving half-sister; and a
young man who holds a secret that could destroy his entire family.
 <BR>

<P>
To keep up with the latest goings-on, most residents can be found
at the Java Web cyber coffeehouse, the blues/rock club called
The Deep, or Elaine's Waffle House.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Sunset Beach</B></I>, the hottest spot to be come January,
premieres <U>Monday, January 6, 1997, at 3:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.

<TITLE>"Dot and Spot's Magical Christmas Adventure" a holiday special on CHCH-TV.</TITLE>

<CENTER>
<H2>CHCH-TV has the delightful holiday special</H2>
<H1>&quot;Dot and Spot's Magical Christmas Adventure&quot;</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>
Dot and Spot , a couple of lovable Dalmatian puppies, rescue Santa
Claus on Christmas Eve with the help of two youngsters, who learn
to appreciate the magic of Santa and their new home.  <I><B>Dot
and Spot's Magical Christmas Adventure</B></I> airs <U>Thursday,
December 19, 1996 (8:00 - 8:30 p.m.)</U>, on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<P>
In <I><B>Dot and Spot's Magical Christmas Adventure</B></I>, the
Marshall family has just moved from New York City to the wilds
of Colorado, a transition that has proven difficult for the two
Marshall children, Ryan and Robin, but particularly for Ryan,
who thinks that Colorado is  the scariest place he has ever known.
 The only thing not frightening to Ryan are his father's two rescue
puppies -- Dot and Spot, who are determined to show the little
fellow that his new home is not all that bad.<BR>

<P>
Then, on Christmas Eve, the adventure begins.  When Dot and Spot
use the telescope on the Marshall's Observation Deck to search
for Santa's sleigh, they find that the jolly old soul is in trouble.
 Immediately they run to wake up Ryan to lead him to the Observation
Deck, and in their excitement, also wake up Robin.  Next, the
foursome make their way through the treacherous snow, wind and
rocky terrain to free Santa and his reindeer from the boulders
that hold them captive.  <BR>

<P>
During the rescue mission, the children hear Dot speak.  It is
at that point that Dot and Santa explain that &quot;on Christmas
Eve, it just takes very special ears and an open heart to hear
all living things communicate.&quot;  Ryan then realizes how much
one can see and hear when not afraid and gains a new appreciation
for the natural beauty that surrounds his new home.  <BR>

<P>
<I><B>Dot and Spot's Magical Christmas Adventure</B></I> airs
<U>Thursday, December 19, 1996, at </U>
<P>
<U>8:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<H2>New community supporters on board as Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police, Y95, The Spectator, CHCH-TV and Food Share kick off this year's</H2>
<I><H1>Christmas Community Food Drive</H1></I>
</CENTER>

<P>
The <B>Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police, Y95, The Spectator,
CHCH-TV </B>and <B>Greater Hamilton Food Share</B> have, once
again, joined forces to urge the community to give generously
to <I><B>The Christmas Community Food Drive</B></I> commencing
<U>Saturday, November 30, 1996, </U>and concluding <U>Tuesday,
December 24, 1996, at 12 noon</U> with a public sing-a-long at
Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Headquarters. <BR>

<P>
The food donations collected from the public will be distributed
by <B>Food Share</B> to: <B>The Good Shepherd Centre, Mission
Services of Hamilton, Neighbour to Neighbour, St. Matthew's House,
Wesley Urban Ministries, Operation Blessing, Crossfire Assembly,
Welcome Inn </B>and <B>Living Water Ministry</B>. A portion of
the food donations will also go to Burlington's <B>Salvation Army
Christmas Bureau</B>.<BR>

<P>
Last year, the above-mentioned five organizations united their
respective food drive campaigns to create a stronger, more expansive
effort to feed the less fortunate in our 'neighbourhood.' The
amalgamation proved successful and attracted the active support
of two prominent businesses: the <B>Sheraton Hamilton Hotel </B>and
<B>Midtown CARSTAR Collision Centre</B>. This year, many of the
campaign's tried and true practices will continue, along with
fresh initiatives and new partners. <I><B>New</B></I> this year:
<BR>

<P>
<B>Midtown CARSTAR Collision Centre</B> -- has volunteered to
make collections at all drop-off locations and deliver the donations
to Food Share's warehouse and Burlington's Christmas Bureau, in
addition to canvassing their suppliers, customers and all area
CARSTAR stores for food donations. <BR>

<P>
<B>Fortino's Supermarkets Shopping Spree</B> -- during Y95's 'Food
Share Friday' broadcasts, originating live from three different
regional police stations, 3 shopping sprees will be given away
for Fortino's Supermarkets at their Dundurn/King location. Fortino's
Supermarkets will then match the total amount in dollars for the
food collected during each of the sprees.<BR>

<P>
<B>Yuk Yuk's Food Share Night </B>-- the comedy venue is donating
a night of entertainment to Y95 contest invitation winners. The
people attending the evening must bring a minimum food donation.
Fortino's Supermarkets will match the total amount of food donated
on that night.<BR>

<P>
<B>Wal-Mart Stores Donate A Buck Campaign</B> -- Food Bank vouchers
will be handed out by all Hamilton Wal-Mart greeters and cashiers.
Customers wishing to help their neighbours in need simply return
the voucher to the cashier and a dollar will be added to their
bill. All proceeds will go to support Greater Hamilton Food Share.
<BR>

<P>
Similar to last year, the <B>Sheraton Hamilton Hotel</B> will
again donate 50 cents to Food Share for every room booked during
<I><B>The Christmas Community Food Drive</B></I> campaign.<BR>

<P>
As in the past, drop-off locations for food donations include
<B>most major food store outlets </B>in the Hamilton area, <B>CHCH-TV
</B>(between 9:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.) and the four main <B>Hamilton-Wentworth
Regional Police stations</B> (open 24 hours). <B>The Spectator
</B>will provide a complete listing of participating sites.<BR>

<P>
Suggested non-perishable food items for donation include: canned
meats, canned vegetables, beans with pork, peanut butter, powdered
milk, canned fruit, macaroni and cheese dinners, rice, pasta,
infant formula and cereals.<BR>

<P>
<B>The Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police, Y95, The Spectator,
CHCH-TV </B>and <B>Greater Hamilton Food Share</B> are committed
to <I><B>The Christmas Community Food Drive</B></I>. However,
it is the generosity of the Greater Hamilton community that will
determine the success of the endeavour. <I><B>The Christmas Community
Food Drive</B></I> commences <U>Saturday, November 30, 1996,</U>
and concludes <U>Tuesday, December 24, 1996, at 12 noon</U> with
a public sing-a-long at Police Headquarters. <BR>

<H1>The Holiday Season Sparkles</H1>
<H2>on CHCH-TV</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>
<B>CHCH-TV</B> welcomes the holiday season with familiar favourites
and new traditions. Following are special Christmas holiday treats
the whole family can enjoy:<BR>

<P>
(in chronological order)<BR>

<HR>

<H2><CENTER><I>CHRISTMAS ON DIVISION STREET<BR>
</I></CENTER></H2>

<P>
A youth, charmed by the wisdom and generosity of a feisty 80-year-old
homeless man, pursues a relationship with the fellow. The alliance
enriches the boy's life just as his old friend relinquishes his.
The bitter-sweet drama, <I><B>Christmas on Division Street</B></I>,
airs <U>Tuesday, December 10, 1996, (8:00 - 10:00 p.m.)</U> on
<B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<P>
<B>Hume Cronyn, Fred Savage, Kenneth Welsh, Cloyce Morrow, Casey
Ellison, Kahla Lichti</B> and <B>Badja Djola</B> star. <BR>

<P>
In <I><B>Christmas On Division Street</B></I>, 14-year-old Trevor
Atwood (Savage), still suffering the loss of his grandfather,
fails to share his family's excitement about their move to Philadelphia.
The transition is made more difficult when Derek (Ellison), the
school jokester feels it his duty to torment the &quot;new guy.&quot;
Then, one day while in the library researching information for
a history paper, Trevor encounters Cleveland Meriwether (Cronyn),
an elderly homeless man and self-proclaimed &quot;Minister of
Education.&quot; His personality and exhaustive knowledge of American
history win Trevor over.<BR>

<P>
As the story unfolds, Trevor pursues a complex friendship with
Cleveland, a man besieged with drinking problems after causing
the death of a boy in an auto accident years ago. 
<P>
So enamored with Cleveland is Trevor that he is unwilling to desert
him no matter the outcome. Even after Cleveland rejects their
friendship, a lie initiated by a social worker, Trevor refuses
to stop caring for the man who would leave him with wonderful
memories and numerous examples of magnanimity: like the time Trevor
was stranded in the rain without train fare and Cleveland sold
his blood to give him the train fare; or the time Cleveland distributed
among the neighbourhood's needy, a sack of clothing Trevor had
brought for him; and so sweet was the time the two walked the
streets through the season's first snowfall when Cleveland landed
a job, temporarily. <BR>

<P>
Only after Cleveland's death, does the essence of the holiday
season take on a new and profound meaning for Trevor and his family.
<I><B>Christmas on Division Street</B></I>, a WIC Entertainment
production, airs <U>Tuesday, December 10, 1996, at 8:00 p.m.</U>

<P>
In <I><B>Ebbie</B></I>, Elizabeth &quot;Ebbie&quot; Scrooge (Lucci)
is a shrewd CEO of Dobson's Department Store. Her rise to the
top has been achieved through difficult decision-making and personal

but also in alienating her from her inner, gentle self and the
important people in her life. <BR>

<P>
Then, on one Christmas Eve, Ebbie is visited by a colourful cast
of midnight visitors who take her on an emotional journey through
her past, present and future. Reliving her former heartaches and

hopeful perspective.<BR>

Amanda, a little girl of six, wishes for a grandfather for Christmas.
In a strange and magical way, her wish is granted. <BR>

Christmas.<BR>

In reality he did. When Elmer discovers that Reg is the son he
never met, he flees in shame, not wanting the secret to be revealed.

Everyone's favourite tough, yet, philosophical private eye goes
after a powerful group of terrorists in a case that could have
explosive international repercussions in, <I><B>Spenser: Judas

In <I><B>Spenser: Judas Goat</B></I>, the family of industrialist
Hugh Dixon is killed by a terrorist bomb.  When Spenser (Urich)

<H1>&quot;Angel Flight Down&quot;</H1>
<H2>a powerful story of heroism and courage on CHCH-TV.</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
When an emergency medical airlift plane, transporting a two-year-old
child in critical condition, crashes into the snowy slope of a
cliff, all passengers, in addition to the child, face the possibility
of dying before being discovered.  Fighting time and unforgiving
weather conditions, a rescue team battles the odds to save everyone
in, <I><B>Angel Flight Down</B></I>, airing <U>Saturday, November
23, 1996, (9:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<P>
Based on official documents, personal interviews and published
accounts, the two-hour production stars <B>Patricia Kalember</B>
(<I>Sisters, thirtysomething</I>), <B>David Charvet</B> (<I>Baywatch</I>),
<B>Christopher Atkins</B> (<I>Child Bride of Short Creek</I>)
and <B>Gary Graham </B>(<I>Robot Jox, The Last Warrior</I>).<BR>

<P>
In<I><B> Angel Flight Down</B></I>, x-rays taken at a small-town
hospital in Colorado reveal that a young toddler's irritated cough
is caused by a small object caught in her esophagus.  When nonsurgical
procedures to remove the object fail, it becomes apparent the
child faces fatal consequences if she does not receive immediate
care from a larger facility in Denver.<BR>

<P>
Despite severe blizzard warnings, the Angel Flight crew --a team
of dedicated professionals comprised of a trained nurse, paramedic
and pilot -- prepare for their emergency flight with the child
and her father.  However, when the twin engine malfunctions, the
small aircraft crashes into the slope of a cliff, leaving all
lives in peril.<BR>

<P>
What ensues is a dramatic rescue effort, as the husband of one
of the nurses leads a team to save all lives concerned in, <I><B>Angel
Flight Down</B></I>, airing <U>Saturday, November 23, 1996, at
9:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<H1>&quot;What Kind of Mother Are You?&quot;</H1>
<H2>a new television movie</H2>
<H2>on CHCH-TV.</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
When a troubled teen encounters a minor brush with the law, her
misled mother, wishing to teach her daughter a lesson, consents
to an overnight jail detention.  Through a miscarriage of justice
the stay is much longer and the task of obtaining the girl's release
becomes an arduous, complex battle in the fact-based movie, <I><B>What
Kind of Mother Are You?</B></I>, airing <U>Sunday, November 17,
1996 (9:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U>, on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<P>
<B>Mel Harris</B> (<I>thirtysomething, Something So Right</I>)
and <B>Nicholle Tom</B> (<I>Beethoven's 2nd</I>) star.<BR>

<P>
In <I><B>What Kind of Mother Are You?</B></I>, teenager Kelly
Jameson (Tom) and her boyfriend, Jake, cut school one day and
Jake attempts to steal a blouse at a mall.  Following their arrest,
Kelly's mother, Laura (Harris), and stepfather confront her with
some biting accusations, which compel her to run off with Jake.
 Days later, Kelly is escorted home by a police officer -- the
result of Jake's second theft attempt.  During a heated exchange
of words, Kelly strikes her mother, triggering, for Laura, the
memory of Kelly's abusive, alcoholic father who committed suicide.
 The officer suggests that Kelly be put in jail overnight to 'cool
off,' but when Laura comes the next morning to pick up her daughter,
she is informed Kelly has been transferred to Juvenile Hall and
assault charges filed.  <BR>

<P>
A manipulative case worker, Marcy Hackman, critical of Laura's
parenting ability, decides that Kelly should be held longer and
sends her off to a centre where an inmate is raped by a maintenance
worker, another suffers a nervous breakdown and Kelly, herself,
is beaten by another girl.  After media attention is focused on
the case, Marcy fabricates a story of Kelly's attempted suicide,
sending the girl back to Juvenile Hall.<BR>

<P>
During a painful mother/daughter psychological evaluation, the
truth about Kelly's father is revealed, leaving Kelly enraged
and her future in jeopardy.  However, at a hearing Laura publicly
blames her own inadequacies as a mother for the problems and Kelly
admits her misdeeds.  The judge, recognizing the promise of a
stronger relationship between the two, rules in favour of Kelly's
release despite Marcy's recommendations for a longer term.  <BR>

<P>
<I><B>What Kind of Mother Are You?</B></I> airs <U>Sunday, November
17, 1996, at 9:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>, pre-release/<B>NBC</B>.

<P>
When a rape victim becomes pregnant, the torment she and her husband
endure waiting to discover the identity of the child's father
does not compare with the anguish the couple will suffer when
the rapist plots to take away their baby in, <I><B>The Secret
She Carried</B></I>, airing <U>Sunday, October 27, 1996 (9:00

<P>
In <I><B>The Secret She Carried</B></I>, Ellen Hayward (Gilpin),
arriving home early one night, is violently assaulted by Lewis
Snow (Burns) -- a man enraged by the fact that his wife and children
have left him.  Before leaving, he threatens to kill Ellen and
her husband, should she dare tell anyone about their encounter.
<BR>

<P>
Ignoring her assailant's threat, Ellen confides in her spouse,
Mitch (Moffett).  The situation is further complicated when Ellen
discovers she is pregnant.  The couple are then faced with the
pain of not knowing the true identity of the child's father. 
At long last medical tests prove that Mitch is indeed the father,
but, Lewis, still on the prowl, imagines himself to be the proud
father.<BR>

<P>
Shortly after Ellen gives birth, a nightmare she experiences becomes
a reality.  One night she answers the phone to hear Lewis' voice
and the cry of her baby in the background.  Lewis is demanding
Ellen come immediately, and alone, to calm their son.  Upon her
arrival, Ellen desperately tries to talk sense to Lewis, but he
turns a deaf ear.  When Ellen grabs her son and flees, Lewis follows
closely behind, with the future of the Hayward family hanging
precariously in the balance.<BR>

<H2>a riveting drama</H2>

<P>
A woman's loyalty between a trusted confidant and her husband,
a grand Wizard in the Ku Klux Klan, is severely tested when she
must plead with him to spare her friend from his fanatical wrath
in, <I><B>Sophie and The Moonhanger</B></I>, airing <U>Wednesday,

<P>
In <I><B>Sophie and The Moonhanger</B></I>, a young, innocent
black woman, Sophie Cooper (Whitfield), lives in rural South Carolina
in the 1950s with her ill-humoured mother and two children.  Employed
by a white family as their housekeeper, Sophie eventually learns
that the head of the house, respected lawyer Ray Edgerton (Andrews),
is a leader in the Ku Klux Klan.  Edgerton's wife, Bonnie (Richardson),
aware of her husband's Klan activities, constantly lives in fear
that she will one day lose her husband.  Nevertheless, she embraces
Sophie as her friend and her children's responsible caregiver.
<BR>

<P>
In time, Sophie meets and marries Holt Jessop (Bernard), a good
man with much pride and ambition.  Together, the couple work to
fulfill Holt's &quot;moonhanging&quot; dream -- a home, business
and a better life for his family.   <BR>

<P>
But the ultimate anguish finally arrives for Bonnie, when she
discovers Ray and his followers have focused on Sophie and her
family as their next victims.  When Ray violently refuses Bonnie's
pleas to pardon Sophie and her family, she is faced with the harsh
reality of what her husband has become and simultaneously freed
by the truth of her friendship with Sophie.<BR>

<H2>A drama based on Jo-Ann Mapson's critically acclaimed novel,</H2>

</CENTER>

<P>
The relationship between a mother and son is destroyed when a
tragic accident leaves the young man almost entirely deaf at the
age of 17.  What ensues is the mother's desperate struggle to
reconcile with her child in, <I><B>Blue Rodeo</B></I>, a drama

star. <BR>

<P>
In <I><B>Blue Rodeo</B></I>, an accident leaves 17-year-old Peter
Yearwood (Allred) almost entirely deaf.  His mother, Maggie (Ann-Margret),
indirectly blames herself, a feeling shared by her son.  In her
attempts to make peace with Peter, Maggie moves to a ranch located
near the school where Peter is sent to learn to deal with his
disability.  Patiently, she ignores her son's anger towards her,
his rejection of her endeavours to make amends and tolerates his
stubbornness.  <BR>

<P>
During this time, Maggie meets and falls in love with her new
neighbour, Owen Whister (Kristofferson), a man Peter instantly
dislikes -- primarily because Owen will not suffer his moodiness
and temper tantrums.<BR>

<P>
Owen's love for Maggie grows, however, complications arise when
Peter's suspicions about the smooth-talking cowboy lead him to
uncover Owen's true identity.<BR>

</CENTER>

<P>
Jessica Savage, a bright, journalistic pioneer triumphed in her
profession despite a tormented personal life, drug abuse and disastrous
relationships.  The television biography, <I><B>Almost Golden:
The Jessica Savitch Story</B></I>, chronicles the span of her
career, which ended with her tragic and controversial death at
the age of 36.  <I><B>Almost Golden</B></I> airs <U>Wednesday,
October 9, 1996 (9:00 - 11:00)</U>, on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<P>
Emmy Award winner <B>Sela Ward</B> (<I>Sisters, The Fugitive,
Hello Again, Nothing in Common</I>), <B>Ron Silver</B> (<I>Chicago
Hope, Reversal of Fortune, Lifepod</I>) and <B>Judith Ivey</B>
(<I>Brighton Beach Memoirs, Hello Again</I>) star.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Almost Golden: The Jessica Savitch Story</B></I> centres
around the career of Jessica Savitch who, at the age of 23, started
out as a cub reporter at a Houston television station.  Overcoming
remarkable odds in her profession, Savitch became the &quot;golden
girl&quot; of television news.<BR>

<P>
However, Savitch's stoic demeanor disguised a turbulent personal
life which included her father's early death, divorce, substance
abuse and a volatile relationship with newsman Ron Kershaw.<BR>

<P>
In 1982, a poll indicated that Savitch was &quot;more popular
than Charles Kuralt, more trusted than Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings
or Ted Koppel.&quot;   One year later, at the age of 36, the beautiful
blonde was dead.  Her car had plunged into the Delaware Canal
in Pennsylvania.<BR>

<P>
Spenser, the hard-nosed, philosophic detective, is seduced into
coming to the aid of an old girlfriend in one of his most compelling
cases in, <I><B>Spenser: A Savage Place</B></I>, airing <U>Sunday,

<H2>on CHCH-TV</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
A woman loses the right to care for her son when her mother sues
for custody of the child on the grounds that her daughter's homosexuality
makes her an unfit mother. Based on a true story, <I><B>Two Mothers
for Zachary</B></I> airs <U>Sunday, September 22, 1996 (9:00 -
11:00 p.m.)</U>, on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<P>

Vanessa Redgrave </B>(<I>Howards End, Agatha, House of the Spirits</I>)
and <B>James Gammon</B> (<I>Leaving Normal, Major League, Major
League II</I>) star.<BR>

<P>
In <I><B>Two Mothers for Zachary</B></I>, a spirited Jody Ann
Shaffell (Bertinelli) moves in with her mother, Nancy (Redgrave),
and her mother's live-in boyfriend, Harlan, following the birth
of her son, Zachary. One morning, after Jody returns from a night
of carousing, Nancy confronts her daughter about her derelict
behaviour and warns her that she will take Zachary away from her
if she fails to straighten out her life.<BR>

<P>
Recognizing the strong bond developing between Nancy and Zach,
and knowing Nancy would carry out her threat, Jody adopts a more
responsible lifestyle. Shortly after starting her new job, Jody
meets Maggie. When the two women's friendship evolves into a warm,
caring relationship, Jody and Zach move in with Maggie. <BR>

<P>
Nancy, appalled to discover that her daughter is gay, finds the
living situation her daughter has chosen to be detrimental to
Zach's upbringing. The issue erupts when Jody disallows Zach to
stay with Nancy anymore as she does not want Zach in the same
house as Harlan, whom, Jody claims, sexually molested her while
she was growing up. Vehemently, Nancy denies the accusations and
successfully sues her daughter for custody of Zach. <BR>

<P>
What ensues is a story filled with anguish, frustration and hope,
as Jody, to this day, fights to win back her son from her mother.

<CENTER>
<H1>The CRTC Announces Decision on</H1>
<H1>CHCH-TV's Ontario Expansion Applications</H1>

</CENTER>

<P>
CHCH-TV is pleased to receive approval from the Canadian Radio-television
and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to establish rebroadcast
transmitters in seven Ontario markets: Ottawa, London, Muskoka,
North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie and Timmins. <BR>

<P>
&quot;Unquestionably, we are delighted with the Commission's decision,&quot;
says Jim Macdonald, president and chief executive officer, CHCH-TV.
&quot;The station's long term interests depended upon this conclusion.
While we are disappointed the CRTC approval of our applications
did not include Kingston, Peterborough and Thunder Bay,&quot;
continues Macdonald, &quot;we are left with the opportunity to
file applications for these markets at another time. With the
CRTC's endorsement to expand our coverage area within the province,
CHCH will be able to compete more equitably in the future.<BR>

<P>
&quot;What I must also make clear at this point,&quot; emphasizes
Macdonald, &quot;is that CHCH's current commitment to local news
coverage will not be affected by our Ontario expansion plans.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
The targeted time frame for rebroadcast transmitters servicing
London, Muskoka, 
<P>
North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie and Timmins to be operational
is spring 1997. The targeted time frame for the Ottawa market
is February 1997. <BR>

<P>
CHCH-TV is a member of WIC Television Ltd., a WIC Western International
Communications Ltd. company. WIC Television Ltd. owns eight television
stations. In addition to CHCH-TV (an independent), WIC Television
Ltd. owns BCTV-Vancouver and CHEK- Victoria (both CTV affiliates),
CHBC-Kelowna and RDTV-Red Deer (both CBC affiliates), ITV-Edmonton,
CICT-Calgary and CISA-Lethbridge (all independents).<BR>

<P>
WIC Western International Communications Ltd. is a leading Canadian
broadcast, communications and entertainment company with its head
office in Vancouver, British Columbia. WIC operates in four market
segments: television, pay television, radio and satellite network
services. In addition to its eight television stations, WIC owns
12 radio stations and is the pay television licensee in Western
Canada for Superchannel, MovieMax! and Home Theatre, a pay-per-view
service which operates under the name Viewer's Choice. Through

Inc. WIC is active in telecommunications and satellite network
services through its 53.7 per cent ownership of Cancom. WIC and
Cancom together own an equity interest in ExpressVu Inc., a Canadian
satellite television direct-to-home (DTH) distribution company.
WIC is also parent to CellularVision Canada Ltd., a wholly-owned
subsidiary which has applied to Industry Canada to provide wireless
broadband communications services to homes and businesses across
the country.

<H1>&quot;Canadians On-Line&quot;</H1>
<H2>A Documentary Special</H2>
<H2>on CHCH-TV.</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
<I><B>Canadians On-Line</B></I>, a timely call to action and examination
of what some pioneering individuals, businesses and entire communities
are doing to prepare for 'tomorrow' and the emerging information
age, airs <U>Saturday, September 14, 1996 (9:00 - 10:00 p.m.)</U>
on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<P>
Like the traditional literacy skills asked of the industrial worker,
the next generation of jobs and economic opportunities will demand
fluency and comfort with computer and communications tools as
well as the culture that embraces them.  With that in mind, <I><B>Canadians
On-Line</B></I> will offer job seekers, workers, parents, youth,
seniors, minorities, business people and, basically, anyone concerned
about their future, a revealing look at people like themselves
who are changing their lives.<BR>

<P>
What does 'being digital'  in the computer communications revolution
really offer up to the average person today and what should we
all be preparing for, for tomorrow?  Through the actions and words
of dozens of Canadians -- from St. John's to Vancouver -- living,
learning and working interactively and on-line, <I><B>Canadians
On-Line</B></I> endeavours to find the answer.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Canadians On-Line</B></I>, a Forevergreen Production, airs
<U>Saturday, September 14, 1996 at 9:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.

<H1>&quot;Dark Horse&quot;</H1>
<H3>on CHCH-TV</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>
Through the love, belief and inexperienced talent of an equestrian
team, an unpredictable stallion accomplishes the impossible in
the inspiring special, <I><B>Dark Horse</B></I>, airing <U>Sunday,
September 1, 1996 (8:00 - 9:00 p.m.)</U>, on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<P>
<B>Wayne Robson</B> (<I>The Grey Fox</I>), <B>Christianne Hirt</B>
(<I>Skate!</I>)<I>,</I> <B>Leon Pownall</B> (<I>Dead Poets Society</I>)
and <B>Catherine Disher</B> star.<BR>

<P>
In<I><B> Dark Horse</B></I>, Derek Conrad (Pownall) is having
difficulty selling Torka, a Grand Prix dressage horse.  His lineage
is that of champions, however, this stallion seems more in need
of a psychiatrist than a trainer.  Only Alanna (Disher), Conrad's
daughter, and Elliot (Robson), an untried trainer, share a special
feeling about Torka.  It is through their love and trust that
the stallion begins to fulfill his potential. <BR>

<P>
When Conrad's optimism about selling the horse rises, Alanna and
Elliott convince him, instead, to let Torka prove himself in the
Olympics, just four months away.  After hiring a promising, unseasoned
rider (Hirt), the dark horse team are ready to challenge the world.
<BR>

<P>
The road to the Olympics is simultaneously arduous and exciting
and suddenly the obstacles of the dressage competition seem moderate
compared with the problems the team has already overcome.  With
the impossible already accomplished, an Olympic medal is in sight.
<BR>

<H1>&quot;Fighting Back&quot;</H1>
<H3>on CHCH-TV</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>
A young fighter, blinded by a lucky punch, faces the fight of
his life when a promising boxer he trains is pitted against the
fighter who knocked him out of the ring.  <I><B>Fighting Back</B></I>,
an uplifting, powerful story that takes place inside as well as
outside the ring, airs <U>Sunday, September 8, 1996 (8:00 - 9:00)</U>,
on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<P>
<B>Real Andrews, George Touliatos, Justin Louis, Chris Owens,
Denise McLeod</B> and <B>Christopher Bondy</B> star.<BR>

<P>
In <I><B>Fighting Back</B></I>, Tommy Mills (Andrews) is a fighter
who has everything going for him -- a loving wife, kids at his
boxing club who adore him and an extraordinary right hand that
will take him to the top.  But when a lucky punch from a competitor
leaves him blind, all seems lost.<BR>

<P>
The attempts of his wife and manager to convince Tommy to enter
into a rehabilitation program are fruitless.  However, when he
learns that Phillip, a bright talent who idolized him, has joined
a street gang and is headed for trouble, Tommy talks to him. 
For the first time in a long while, he feels useful.  He even
agrees to become Phillip's trainer and despite his lack of sight,
is able to remember more than most trainers will ever know.<BR>

<P>
When a cunning promoter proposes the idea of pitting Phillip against
the same fighter who blinded Tommy, Tommy opposes the match, arguing
that Phillip isn't ready.  It is his wife who changes his mind
by reminding him of another young, hungry boxer from years ago.
<BR>

<P>
Now, Tommy and Phillip face the fight of their lives in the one
hour special, <I><B>Fighting Back</B></I>, airing <U>Sunday, September
8, 1996 at 8:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<H2>A woman remembers nothing in the drama</H2>
<H1>&quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;</H1>
<H3>on CHCH-TV</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>
A young woman, victimized by her husband and his mistress, must
recall who she is before a murderous plot is carried through in,
<I><B>Sweet Dreams</B></I>, airing <U>Sunday, September 15, 1996
(9:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U>, on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

90210</I>), <B>Amy Yasbeck </B>(<I>Wings</I>), <B>David Newsom
</B>(<I>Homefront</I>), <B>A Martinez</B> (<I>L.A. Law</I>) and
<B>Conchata Ferrell </B>(<I>L.A. Law</I>) star.<BR>

<P>
In <I><B>Sweet Dreams</B></I>, when a young woman (Thiessen) is
found sopping wet and hypothermic on Long Harbour Island's Ruby
Beach, police chief Doug Harrison (Martinez) rushes her to the
hospital.  With the island doctor's help (Ferrell), the young
woman regains her health, but is unable to remember her name.
 Days later, Dr. Jack Renault (Newsom), a psychiatrist who is
renting a house on the island with his wife Laura (Yasbeck) and
year-old daughter, appears on the scene offering his assistance,
claiming he had learned about the &quot;mystery&quot; woman in
the paper.<BR>

<P>
Harrison, attracted to the amnesiac woman known as &quot;Jane,&quot;
is suspicious of Renault and his wife, for they seem overly interested
in the victim's case.  As Renault continues to treat &quot;Jane,&quot;
bits and pieces of her past are revealed and she discovers her
real name is Alison.  Gradually, flashes of elapsed memories strike
a familiar chord, but Alison does not have the luxury of time
to linger over these revelations.  She must uncover her identity
as quickly as possible before the evil duo, Jack and Laura, can
complete their deadly scheme.<BR>

<H1>&quot;When The Vow Breaks&quot;</H1>
<H3><I>starring Patty Duke</I></H3>
<H3>on CHCH-TV</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>
When a man designates his daughter as sole beneficiary of his
life insurance, his wife files for divorce.  The action ultimately
leads her to a richer existence as she rebuilds her life; enters
law school; and, representing herself, wins a court appeal in,
<I><B>When The Vow Breaks</B></I>, airing <U>Tuesday, August 6,
1996 (9:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U>, on <B>CHCH-TV</B>. 
<P>
<B>Patty Duke</B> and <B>Linda Dano</B> star in the made-for-television
movie based on a true story.
<P>
In<B> <I>When the Vow Breaks</I></B>, Barbara Porter (Duke) is
a devoted mother and grandmother trapped in a passionless marriage
to a controlling man.  The marriage completely disintegrates when
her husband appoints his daughter as sole beneficiary of his life
insurance policy.  At that point Barbara files for divorce.
<P>
While preparing for the hearing, it is discovered that Barbara's
husband is a millionaire twice-over and he alone has control over
their assets.  At the conclusion of the hearing, Barbara is delivered
several devastating blows by the presiding judge who is notorious
for his contempt for no-fault divorce.  Her husband is awarded
their entire estate and Barbara's plea for no financial support
is ignored and weekly alimony payments decreed.  
<P>
Unwilling to defy the distinguished judge's decision, Barbara's
attorney suggests she represent herself in an appeal.  Following
her lawyer's advice, Barbara enters law school.
<P>
In the middle of reassembling her life, Barbara meets a new man,
renews her relationship with her daughter and achieves her utmost
goal -- she represents herself in court and wins the battle. 
In addition, Barbara discloses damaging information that leads
to the termination of the once venerated judge.

 When Marie's estranged husband, Mick (Remar), arrives on the

a place where everyone seems to have a motive for murder.

</CENTER>


<P>
Mercenaries and missionaries barter for the land as well as the
souls of a native culture fighting for its survival.  In the process,
high ideals clash with brutal realities and both good and evil
are found to be imperfect in <I><B>At Play in the Fields of the
Lord</B></I>, airing <U>Sunday, July 28 (part 1)</U> and <U>Monday,
July 29, 1996 (part 2; 9:00 - 11:00 p.m. both nights)</U>, on
<B>CHCH-TV</B>.

Dolores Claiborne</I>) star.
<P>
<I><B>At Play in the Fields of the Lord</B></I>, adapted from
the novel by Peter Matthiessen, is about power, progress, greed,
religion and two cultures in conflict as a moral, human chess
game unfolds.  It is also about how even good intentions, if misguided,
can destroy a thriving culture -- a conclusion reached by two
characters in the film through radically different paths.  
<P>
Hired by a local government official to drive the Niaruna tribe
off their land, Lewis Moon (Berenger) an American mercenary, who
is himself one-half Cheyenne, joins the Brazilian native tribe.
 Opposite Moon is Martin Quarrier (Quinn), a missionary intent
on converting the tribe to Christianity, but finds his respect
for their beliefs in conflict with his mission.  As well, he becomes
disillusioned by the hypocrisy of his superior, evangelist Leslie
Huben (Lithgow).  Both Moon and Quarrier join forces to confront
the power and violence of authorities and in the process question
their moral right to lead the Indians to a &quot;better way of
life.&quot;

<TITLE>The Mother's Day Telethon exceeds goal for fourth consecutive year!</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY background="../../gifs/bkgd.jpg">

<H1><I>The Mother's Day Telethon</I></H1>
<H3>exceeds goal for fourth consecutive year!</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>
The fourth annual <I><B>Mother's Day Telethon</B></I>, a partnership
between <B>CHCH-TV</B> and <B>Chedoke-McMaster Hospitals Foundation</B>,
concluded its 24-hour celebration at 7:00 p.m. tonight, <U>Sunday,
May 12, 1996,</U> with the tote board proudly displaying the final
tally, <B>$1,045,630! </B>
<P>
&quot;The generosity of people in the communities we serve is
simply extraordinary,&quot; expressed Ursula Evans, executive
director of the <B>Chedoke-McMaster Hospitals Foundation </B>and
co-executive producer of the telethon. &quot;We are truly grateful
to all the individuals, groups and corporations who have participated
this year. Their tremendous support of the Children's Hospital
will provide much needed equipment to enhance the care of acutely
and critically ill children and their families.&quot; 
<P>
Children's Hospital at Chedoke-McMaster serves a population base
of 1.8 million people in over 70 communities in central west Ontario.
Funds raised from this year's telethon will be allocated to the
purchase of: an <B>NICU Transport Incubator, Laparoscopes, Metabolic
Cart, Microcomputers, PIC Monitors </B>and<B> Ventilators.</B>
<P>
&quot;What is particularly gratifying and inspiring to see each
year,&quot; continues Ursula Evans, &quot;is the number of young
people involved and individuals who come forth with fresh concepts
to raise funds for the Hospital. For example, this year, 85 schools
were responsible for raising over $85,000, and Jimmy Vlajkov from
The Attic, a well-known community supporter, was the impetus behind
the Sports Celebrity Auction, a new telethon feature which garnered
wonderful results.&quot;
<P>
&quot;In addition to the community members who embraced the spirit

<H3>a new television movie on CHCH-TV</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>
The new two-hour movie, <I><B>Dr. Who</B></I>, based on the long-running
BBC science fiction series of the same name, finds The Doctor,
who travels through time restoring justice and overcoming alien
threats, embarking on his eighth adventure.  <I><B>Dr. Who </B></I>premieres
<U>Tuesday, May 14, 1996, (8:00 - 10:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.

Ashbrook</B> (<I>Midnight Heat</I>) and<B> Eric Roberts</B> (<I>It's
My Party</I>) star.
<P>
In <I><B>Dr. Who</B></I>, The Doctor (McGann) experiences a malfunction
with his time machine while transporting the remains of the evil
Master (Roberts) back to his home planet.  The problem forces
him to land in San Francisco on December 30, 1999, whereupon,
the injured Doctor is rushed to the hospital and The Master --
a serious danger to the Universe -- escapes and takes over the
body of an unsuspecting paramedic (Roberts).
<P>
While in hospital, The Doctor is accidentally killed on the operating
table by Dr. Grace Holloway (Ashbrook), who is unaware of his
two hearts.  However, after he regenerates into his new body,
it is the same Dr. Holloway that The Doctor turns to for help
in finding his identity, The Master and a way to save the Universe.

for Fall '96, premieres <U>Tuesday, May 14, 1996, at 8:00 p.m.</U>

<H3>An all-star lineup of teens hit the history trail in</H3>
<H1><I> &quot;Kidz In The Wood&quot;</I></H1>

<P>
As their forefathers did, the truly urban group of teens face

In <I><B>Our Son, The Matchmaker</B></I>, beauty shop owner Julie

her. The story takes viewers back to the time when Julie was 15
years of age and wildly in love with Steve Carson, a schoolmate.
When Julie becomes pregnant with his child, she is forced by her
mother (Burstyn), a fierce woman, to leave and give the child
up for adoption. Her abrupt departure does not allow for explanations
or good-byes with Steve, who remained oblivious of the circumstances.
<P>
Back in the present, Julie consents to meet with her son, Scott,
who is now a minister, married and expecting a child of his own.
At his insistence, Julie tracks down Steve. Her former sweetheart
is divorced and Julie, herself, engaged to another man, however,
they both discover the years have not diminished their passion
for one another.

Through their son's ingenious manipulation, the two find the happiness
that was lost to them 28 years before, and when they reunite officially,
it is their son who officiates at the nuptials.

<P>
FBI agent Vinnie Terranova jeopardizes his life to infiltrate
and destroy a corrupt company run by a powerful married couple
in <I><B>Wiseguy</B></I>, airing <U>Wednesday, May 1, 1996, (9:00
-11:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
<B>Ken Wahl</B>, <B>Debrah Farentino</B>, <B>Ted Levine</B> and
<B>Zachary Brown</B> star.
<P>
In <I><B>Wiseguy</B></I>, Vinnie Terranova (Wahl) secures a job
at an affluent country club frequented by Paul and Emma Callendar
(Levine and Farentino), the couple who head up a suspicious business,
Callendar Industries.  During his first day, Terranova thwarts
a kidnap attempt on the couple's young son, Alex (Brown).  While
recovering from his wounds in the hospital, Paul Callendar offers
Terranova the job of Alex's bodyguard.   
<P>
During an informal meeting with Paul, Terranova learns the nature
of his employer's illegal business -- the selling of high level
secrets to any one who can pay the price.  Soon afterwards, Terranova
accompanies Paul to a meeting with a Korean delegation seeking
classified information.  When Paul realizes the information they
request could put the lives of innocent Americans at risk, he
refuses to do business, which leads to a bloodthirsty shoot-out
and Terranova narrowly saving Paul's life.
<P>
The next morning Terranova awakens to the news that Paul has been
murdered and that his wife, Emma, is president of Callendar Industries.
 He also learns that her dealings with the company are more than
superficial.  It was she who had arranged the first meeting with
the Koreans with her now deceased husband.  As Terranova accompanies
Emma to a second meeting with the Korean group, he witnesses a
carefully orchestrated sting that ultimately sends the woman to
prison.
<P>
With Paul dead and Emma imprisoned, Alex is now left in the care
of his grandparents, however, Terranova vows to remain a constant
part of the child's life.  <I><B>Wiseguy</B></I> airs <U>Wednesday,

<H1><I> &quot;The Beast&quot;</I></H1>
<H1>a four-hour mini-series on CHCH-TV</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>
Based on the best-selling novel by Peter Benchley (&quot;Jaws&quot;),
<I><B>The Beast</B></I> is about a gigantic sea creature that
terrorizes a quiet seaside community and, unless it is killed,
will demolish everyone.   <I><B>The Beast</B></I> airs <U>Sunday
and Monday, April 28 and 29, 1996, (9:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
<B>William Petersen </B>(<I>To Live &amp; Die in L.A., Manhunter,
Young Guns, Fear</I>), <B>Karen Sillas </B>(<I>True Blue, One
Life to Live, Simple Men, Risk, Under Suspicion</I>), and Emmy
winner <B>Larry Drake</B> (<I>L.A. Law, Darkman, The Karate Kid,
Dr. Giggles</I>) star.  Also appearing are <B>Missy Crider, Charles
Martin Smith, Ronald Guttman, Sterling Macer, Jr. </B>and <B>Murray
Bartlett.</B>
<P>
In <I><B>The Beast </B></I>(Part 1) Coast Guard Lieutenant Kathryn
Marcus (Sillas) authorizes fisherman Whip Dalton (Petersen) and
his partner, Mike (Macer Jr.), to tow in an empty lifeboat drifting
off the coast of Graves Point Island.  A large, sharp claw is
discovered in the raft accompanied by an overwhelming ammonia
scent.  Perplexed and alarmed, the claw is sent to marine biologist
Dr. Herbert Talley (Guttman) for scrutiny. 
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of disturbing events ensue: the steel cables
on the boat of a notorious drunk and poacher, Lucas Coven (Drake),
are neatly severed; the mangled remains of a sperm whale wash
ashore; and two scuba divers disappear without a trace.
<P>
Dr. Talley then identifies the mysterious claw.  It belongs to
an Architeuthis dux -- a sea creature documented as having reached
monstrous proportions.  With its natural food source gone from
the over-fished waters off Graves Point Island, the beast seems
to have found human fare a satisfactory replacement.  In an effort
to preserve the tourist trade, Schuyler Graves (Smith), founder
and landlord of Graves Point, hires Lucas to destroy the beast
any way he must.
<P>
In <I><B>The Beast</B></I> (Part 2) Lucas blows up the 38 foot,
1,000 pound beast.  When Graves denies Dr. Talley permission to
examine the beast for research purposes, Dr. Talley organizes
an excursion to the beast's underwater lair.  While submerged,
a creature triple the size of the beast Lucas killed, attacks
and crushes the sea vessel.  It is clear at that point, that the
attack was one of revenge provoked by the death of one of its
off-spring.
<P>
Again, Graves turns to Lucas for help.  This time, however, Lucas
and his crew, with the exception of Mike, Whip's partner, meet
a gruesome end.   Now, the lives of the townspeople appear to
be in the hands of one man -- Whip Dalton.
<P>
<I><B>The Beast</B></I>, a two-part mini-series, airs <U>Sunday
and Monday, April 28 and 29 at 9:00 p.m. </U>on <B>CHCH-TV</B>,

A navy lieutenant, sexually assaulted while attending the 1991
Tailhook Convention, shakes the Navy's very foundation and changes
it forever when she goes public with the disgrace in, <I><B>She

on a true story.
<P>
In <I><B>She Stood Alone: The Tailhook Scandal</B></I>, Lieutenant
Paula Coughlin (O'Grady) is an individual committed to serving
her country.  While attending the Tailhook Convention in 1991,
she is sexually assaulted.  The incident forces her to change
her focus and &quot;to take a stand to right a wrong.&quot;
<P>
The ordeal is frustrating at best.  When Lieutenant Coughlin submits
her report of the transgression to her boss, Rear Admiral Jack
Snyder (Torn), she receives little acknowledgment of the crime.
 Next, a number of the aviators initially refuse to cooperate
with the investigation.  Then, as the Navy delays in bringing
her attackers to justice, Lieutenant Coughlin feels compelled
to go public with the scandal.
<P>
The dramatization of Lieutenant Coughlin's story is based on interviews,
court documents, official reports and other published accounts.
 A few of the names have been changed and composite characters
introduced.

<P>
With unwavering tenacity, a social worker crusades to ensure that
her school's principal is brought to justice for his sexual obsessions
in <I><B>Moment of Truth: Deceived By Trust</B></I>, airing <U>Sunday,

<P>
<B>Stepfanie Kramer, Michael Gross</B> and <B>Shannon Fill</B>
star.
<P>
In<I><B> Moment of Truth: Deceived by Trust</B></I>, a normally
quiet, reserved student, Cindy Webster, confides in the school's
social worker, Sarah Collins (Kramer), that the principal, Gordon
Powell (Gross), sexually molested her.  When Sarah begins to investigate
the allegations against Powell, she is met with reticence and
fear from teachers, school officials and even Cindy's mother,
who all support the popular and influential Powell.
<P>
Even when Sarah is demoted and transferred to another school,
she refuses to discontinue her campaign.  Putting her own career
at risk to expose Powell's deviate behaviour, she manages to obtain
a closed hearing from the Board of Education.  Sadly, the fragile
Cindy denies her original story giving way to the pressures induced
by her mother and other authority figures.
<P>
A tip then leads Sarah and her attorney friend to two more of
Powell's victims who admit to being abused by Powell, but who
refuse to testify.  In an effort to prevent Powell from being
promoted to Superintendent, Sarah next enlists the help of a newspaper
reporter and  meets a photographer of questionable character who
participated in some of the acts of abuse and, when granted a
lesser sentence in exchange for his testimony, implicates Powell.
 
<P>
Finally, one of the students summons the courage to come forward
to disclose the truth and, at last, following Cindy's attempted
suicide, Cindy's mother accepts the horrific facts.

<H1><I> &quot;Deadly Web&quot;</I></H1>
<H1>a movie thriller on CHCH-TV</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>
A woman's Internet friend becomes her stalker, invading every
area of her life until she is finally forced to confront him in
a terrifying struggle to save her life and the life of her son
in <I><B>Deadly Web</B></I>, airing <U>Monday, April 15, 1996
(9:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>. 
<P>
Based on a true story, the two-hour television movie stars <B>Gigi
Rice,</B> <B>Ed Marinaro, John Wesley Shipp</B> and <B>Andrew
Lawrence</B>.
<P>
In <I><B>Deadly Web</B></I>, all seems to be going well for the
recently separated Terri Lawrence (Rice) who is trying to make
a new life for herself and her son, Spence (Lawrence).  She has
a job at a hospital library and both have made friends over the
Internet -- Spence has met &quot;CeeGee&quot; and Terri, &quot;Cybergod,&quot;
who eventually turns into a stalker, aware of every detail of
Terri's life.
<P>
The annoyance turns into terror when a doctor is killed.  Terri
becomes suspect of three of her colleagues: Barry Fox, a computer
whiz; Laura Pierson, who would like to see Terri gone; and Dr.
Todd Stanton (Shipp), whose flirtatious nature makes her feel
ill at ease.  As a result, Terri thinks she can trust no one,
not even Frank Jones (Marinaro), a former police officer, who
claims he has been following the stalker for years and knows &quot;Cybergod&quot;
has harmed others, including his former partner.
<P>
The terror accelerates when Spence's school computer is accessed
and the child's birth certificate appears on the screen revealing
the true identity of his biological father.  The act sends the
traumatized boy running out onto the street and into the path
of an oncoming car.   When Barry Fox is accidentally killed, some
of Terri's anxiety is lessened as she hoped he was &quot;Cybergod.&quot;
  The comfort, however, is short-lived as it becomes evident that
Dr. Todd Stanton is the one who has devised a complex plan that
results in Terri, Spence and Frank fighting for their lives.
<P>
A friendly computer game, <I><B>Deadly Web</B></I>, lives up to
its name in the movie by the same name airing <U>Monday, April
15, 1996, at 9:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>, simulcast/<B>NBC</B>.

</CENTER>


<P>
Murder, treachery and seduction are tools used by an impenitent
young woman in order to achieve her artistic goals in, <I><B>Face
of Evil</B></I> airing <U>Tuesday, April 9, 1996, (9:00 -11:00
p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
<B>Tracey Gold</B> and <B>Perry King</B> star.
<P>
In <I><B>Face of Evil</B></I>, we meet Darcy Palmer (Gold), who,
on her wedding night, empties her new husband's bank account and
flees to New York City to pursue a career as an artist.  On her
way, she meets Brianne Dwyer, a youth just off to college, whom
she kills and then assumes her identity.
<P>
Darcy (now known as Brianne) thrives at college and flourishes
as a painter, marred only by having to blind a counselor who had
previously met the real Brianne.  Her roommate is 19-year-old
Jeanelle, the daughter of a recently widowed, wealthy gentleman,
Russel (King).  Brianne's character softens when she meets Russel
at Thanksgiving, making him realize how his destructive behaviour,
caused by alcohol, affects Jeanelle.  Consequently, he stops drinking
and revives the loving, generous nature he possessed prior to
his wife's death.  
<P>
Soon after, however, Brianne resumes her trail of evil as she:
poisons Jeanelle when Russel comes to visit the campus, making
her too ill to spend time with him -- so Brianne can; murders
her ex-fiancee who shows up at her art exhibit; lies to the real
Brianne's parents by telling them that Brianne wanted to abandon
them, and it was she who suggested Darcy take her place.  When
Darcy is expelled from school, she moves in with Russel and seduces
him.  And, finally, Darcy attempts to kill Jeanelle who has become
suspect of her.  
<P>
In the end, Darcy discloses that she may not really be Darcy,
but rather another victim's identity she has assumed.  <I><B>Face
of Evil </B></I>airs <U>Tuesday, April 9, 1996, at 9:00 p.m.</U>

<H1>on CHCH-TV</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>
Based on actual events, <I><B>Never Give Up: The Jimmy V Story</B></I>
is about coach Jim Valvano, a genial, inspirational man who left
behind a legacy in the world of basketball and who, more importantly,
touched people's lives.  It airs <U>Tuesday, April 2, 1996, (9:00
-11:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
<B>Anthony LaPaglia, Ashley Crow, Lou Criscoulo, Blair Struble,
Wendy Hoopes </B>and <B>Ronny Cox </B>star.
<P>
In <I><B>Never Give Up: The Jimmy V Story</B></I>, Jim Valvano
(LaPaglia) starts out living the life he planned back in high
school when he, himself, was a star basketball player: he settles
down with his high school sweetheart, Pam Levine (Crow) and becomes
a coach.  What his plan does not include is the trouble he will
encounter in his career, his marriage and ultimately his health.
<P>
Liked by everyone, Valvano's special gift is coaching, which is
never more evident than in his locker room talks, in particular,
the speech he gives to the North Carolina State Wolfpack when
he leads them to victory during the 1983 NCAA Championships.
<P>
However, &quot;Coach V&quot; eventually starts to experience a
few problems in his life.  The strain of his absence from home
impacts on his marriage.  Following an NCAA investigation, which
finds him guilty of minor infractions, Valvano is fired.  Before
long, he is hired to be a sports commentator on ESPN only to be
diagnosed with cancer shortly thereafter.  
<P>
Determined to live life to the fullest until the end, Valvano
learns to paint, golfs and does another ESPN show.  He also forms
the V-Foundation, an organization dedicated to cancer research.
 
<P>
Shortly before his death, he is honoured by the Wolfpack Club
at the 10-year reunion of the championship team where he delivers
a speech that brings everyone to their feet.   <I><B>Never Give
Up: The Jimmy V Story</B></I> airs <U>Tuesday, April 2, 1996,
at 9:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>, simulcast/<B>CBS</B>.

payments), premieres <U>Friday, March 29, 1996, (9:00 - 10:00
p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
<B>Don Johnson</B> (<I>Miami Vice</I>), <B>Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa,
Annette O'Toole, Serena Scott Thomas, Jeff Perry, Jamie Gomez
</B>and<B> Jodi Lynn O'Keefe</B> star along with <B>Cheech Marin</B>
who appears in a recurring role.
<P>
As <I><B>Nash Bridges</B></I>, Johnson is the lead member of the
elite &quot;Special Investigators Bureau&quot; with the San Francisco
Police Department.  He is one of the best, possessing singular
instincts, a good sense of humour and a certain charm.
<P>
From time to time he finds himself working along side his wisecracking
ex-partner, Joe Dominguez (Marin), who left the force for an easier
life as a private investigator.  Yet, somehow he manages to get
himself wrapped up in Nash's cases.
<P>
In his personal life, Nash does not enjoy the same &quot;top notch&quot;
reputation he relishes professionally, as he struggles with the
responsibilities of a delicate balancing act -- two ex-wives and
an inquisitive 16-year-old daughter.
<P>
Don Johnson, Carlton Cuse (<I>Adventures of Brisco County, Jr</I>.)
and John Nicolella (<I>Miami Vice</I>) are executive producers
of the series.

Unyielding in their pursuit to find their missing daughter, ordinary
parents take extraordinary steps in, <I><B>Race Against Time:
The Search for Sarah</B></I>, a drama inspired by actual events
and airing <U>Tuesday, March 19, 1996, (9:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U>

<P>
Emmy Award winner <B>Patty Duke</B> (<I>My Sweet Charlie, The
Captains and the Kings, The Miracle Worker, Call Me Anna</I>)
and <B>Richard Crenna</B> (<I>First Blood, Rambo, Rambo III, Table
for Five, Sweet Ginger Brown</I>, and <I>Janek</I> TV film series)
reunite to star in this production after having worked together
in <I>It Takes Two</I>. 
<P>
In <I><B>Race Against Time: The Search for Sarah</B></I>, Sarah
Porter fails to show up at a special function honouring her father,
John (Crenna).   At first, her family is annoyed and wearied at
what appears to be typical behaviour for Sarah.  However, Sarah's
mother, Natalie (Duke), is convinced something is horribly wrong.
 Her instincts are right, for Sarah has been carjacked by acquaintances
and her beaten body discarded near a ravine.   
<P>
  
<P>
When the Porters first report Sarah's disappearance to the police,
they do nothing because of Sarah's past behaviour -- she has run
away from home once before.  Furthermore, when Sarah's car is
stopped, the officer wrongly assumes the woman in the back seat
is Sarah and neglects to ask for identification. 
<P>
Frustrated and fearful, the entire Porter family bands together
to find Sarah.  They distribute flyers with Sarah's photo on them
and even track down the officer who supposedly identified Sarah.
  Following a phone tip that details Sarah's fate, John, who has
subsequently suffered a mild heart attack due to the agonizing
ordeal, sneaks out of the hospital to confront the people who
have kidnapped his daughter.
<P>
Eventually, Sarah is found -- near dead and almost buried at the
bottom of a ravine.

When a noted filmmaker learns that her closest childhood friend
has been convicted of murder, she goes to extraordinary lengths
to have the decision reversed in the television movie <I><B>In</B></I>
<I><B>The Blink Of An Eye</B></I>, airing <U>Sunday, March 24,

<P>
<B>Veronica Hamel </B>and <B>Mimi Rogers </B>star in the two-hour
production.
<P>
Based on a true story, <I><B>In The Blink Of An Eye </B></I>is
about a remarkable friendship between two women who made a pact
during their youth to be &quot;blood sisters&quot; forever.  Three
decades later, the one, Micki Dickoff (Hamel), a distinguished
documentary filmmaker, learns that the other, Sunny Jacobs (Rogers),
has been imprisoned for the last 15 years.  Sunny, along with
her companion Jesse, had been convicted of killing two policemen
and now Sunny is about to be executed for the crime.
<P>
Micki visits her childhood friend in prison who professes she
is innocent, claiming that the shots must have come from an ex-con,
Walter Rhodes, who was riding in the car with Sunny and Jesse
and their children.  When they were arrested, the District Attorney
was determined to obtain a speedy conviction.  To that end, he
cut a deal that would see Rhodes testifying that Sunny and Jesse
killed the officers.  As well, the D.A. persuaded an inmate to
falsely testify that Sunny had told her that she and Jesse had,
indeed, killed the cops.
<P>
Believing in Sunny's innocence, Micki puts her career on hold
to solve her friend's case and, in the process, reaches a startling
conclusion.   <I><B>In The Blink Of An Eye</B></I>, directed by
Micki Dickoff, airs <U>Sunday, March 24, 1996, at 9:00 p.m.</U>

<H3>A NOSTALGIC FAMILY DRAMA ON CHCH-TV</H3>

</CENTER>

<P>
Exasperated with living in a low-class Brooklyn housing project,
a 1950s housewife secretly finds a job so she, her husband, and
two children can enjoy a better life far away from the confines
of <I><B>Radiant City</B></I>, a new television movie airing <U>Sunday,
March 31, 1996, (9:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
<B>Kirstie Alley</B> (<I>Cheers, Look Who's Talking</I>), <B>Clancy
Brown</B> (<I>The Shawshank Redemption</I>), <B>Tori McPetrie
</B>(<I>The Silence of Adultery</I>), <B>Adam Lamberg, Fab Filippo</B>
and <B>Gil Bellows</B> star.     
<P>
Set in 1950s Brooklyn, New York, <I><B>Radiant City</B></I> centres
around the Goodman family: Gloria (Alley), a middle-aged housewife
who yearns to move away from the Radiant City housing project;
her husband Al (Brown), a poorly paid post office worker who must
remain below a certain income level in order to stay in Radiant
City; Stewie (Lamberg) their impish 10-year-old; and Sherry (McPetrie),
their love-sick, sweet 16-year-old. 
<P>
Frustrated with contending with gossipy women, a flirtatious neighbour
named Bert (Bellows) and a policeman's harsh treatment of her
son's mischievous behaviour, Gloria decides to look for a job.
 Posing as an educated, single woman, she secures a position as
a cosmetics salesperson at Macy's department store.  Secretly,
she starts to save for a house, otherwise the family could be
ejected before Gloria has saved enough.  But, when Stewie follows
her to work one day, the word gets out.
<P>
When Al bemoans the fact he is unable to provide for a richer
life, Gloria convinces him to stop gambling on horses and gamble
instead on life.  Before the housing authority can evict the Goodman
family, they proudly announce they are buying a home in New Jersey.
<P>
In the end, Al finds a better job at the post office, Gloria keeps
hers and Sherry and Stewie regret leaving the familiarity of <I><B>Radiant
City</B></I>, a sentimental drama airing <U>Sunday, March 31,
1996, at 9:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>, simulcast/<B>ABC</B>.

<TITLE>CRTC Confirms Hearing of CHCH-TV Expansion Applications
</TITLE>

<H2><I>CRTC Confirms Hearing of CHCH-TV Ottawa</I></H2>

<H2><I>and Ontario Expansion Applications</I> </H2>

</CENTER>

<P>
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission
(CRTC) has confirmed today that it will hear <B>CHCH-TV</B>'s
Ottawa and Ontario expansion applications in April, 1996.  
<P>
The Ontario expansion applications filed seek amendments to <B>CHCH-TV</B>'s
broadcast license which would allow rebroadcast transmitters to
be established in nine Ontario markets: London, Kingston, Peterborough,
Muskoka, North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, Timmins, and Thunder
Bay.  
<P>
The <B>CHCH</B> program schedule will provide these communities
with a significant amount of new programming options.  While <B>CHCH</B>
is available in a few of the markets on cable, on average 60%
of the programs in the <B>CHCH</B> schedule are not seen in the
nine markets the station proposes to serve.
<P>
Originally, <B>CHCH </B>filed a programming undertaking application
for Ottawa which would provide local newscasts to the city and
area.  Subsequently, the station also filed a straight rebroadcast
application.  Following the CRTC's decision to hear only one application
and responding to the Commission's concern about the Ottawa economy,
<B>CHCH</B> withdrew its original Ottawa application for a programming
undertaking.
<P>
&quot;The choice was difficult,&quot; expresses Jim Macdonald,
president and chief executive officer, <B>CHCH-TV</B>.  &quot;However,
we chose to go forward with a rebroadcast model for Ottawa as
it would be consistent with our rebroad approach in the other
nine Ontario markets.  Furthermore, we are delighted with the
Commission's quick response, and that all of our applications
will be heard concurrently.&quot; 
<P>
<B>CHCH</B> is owned by <B>WIC Western International Communications
Ltd</B>., and is a subsidiary of <B>Westcom TV Group Ltd</B>.
 <B>WIC</B> is an integrated Canadian communications, broadcast
and entertainment company with its head office in Vancouver, British
Columbia.  <B>WIC</B> is the only Canadian broadcasting company
operating in television, pay television, radio and satellite network
services.

<P>
When a woman discovers that her husband is a rapist and that he
could potentially harm their daughter, she makes a desperate move
to prove his guilt in <I><B>The Stranger Beside Me</B></I>, airing
<U>Tuesday, February 27, 1996, (9:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.

<B>Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, Eric Close</B> and <B>Casey Sander</B>
star.
<P>
In <I><B>The Stranger Beside Me</B></I>, shy Jennifer Moore, a
recent transplant to Albuquerque, is swept off her feet in a whirlwind
romance by the outgoing Chris Gallagher.  Before long, they are
married and on their way to San Diego where Chris commences his
Navy career.
<P>
After the move, Chris suddenly becomes distant and passionless.
 He experiences claustrophobia, making his submarine assignment
difficult.  To cope, he starts running at night, which makes Jennifer
most uneasy as the base is plagued by a peeper.  When a woman
is actually raped, Jennifer's fears mount.  
<P>
Following Chris's arrest for voyeurism and rape, a pregnant Jennifer
wants desperately to believe in her husband's innocence.  That
belief is tested when he pleads guilty to the peeping charge,
but not the rape charge.  In the end, the latter charge is dropped
due to insufficient evidence.  Sent back to Albuquerque with a
dishonourable discharge, Chris begs Jennifer to give him another
chance.  But, before long, he starts going out at night again
and the night Jennifer goes into labour, a woman is raped.   
 
<P>
When Chris's sister reveals she was molested by her brother for
years, Jennifer calls the police who choose to protect their hometown
buddy.  After Chris threatens to harm their daughter if Jennifer
tries to leave, Jennifer takes action.   Frantic to prove her
husband's guilt, she trails him to the next victim's house.  As
he breaks in, Jennifer calls the police who arrive in time to
arrest him.  Chris is ultimately sentenced to 99 years in prison.

<H1>CHCH has Neil Simon's</H1>

<H1><I>&quot;Jake's Women&quot;</I></H1>

</CENTER>

<P>
A writer, going through a trial separation, travels back and forth
between his past and present, reality and his rich imagination,
uncovering some truths, some pain, and a great deal of laughter
in <I><B>Jake's Women</B></I> airing <U>Sunday, March 3, 1996,
(9:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
Starring in the two-hour television movie are <B>Alan Alda, Anne
Archer, Lolita Davidovich, Julie Kavner, Joyce Van Patten, Mira
Sorvino </B>and<B> Kimberly Williams.</B>
<P>
In <I><B>Jake's Women</B></I>, Jake (Alda) is a writer with a
problem.  To put it in his words his &quot;mind has a mind of
its own.&quot;  His fictional characters are so real, they actually
become real.  And, when life becomes too much, well, Jake simply
retreats into his fertile imagination, delightfully blurring the
lines of reality and fantasy, which often leads him into trouble.
<P>
Now, after eight years of marriage, Jake's wife Maggie (Archer)
feels she is suffocating and that Jake no longer communicates.
 A six-month trial separation is suggested.   This, of course,
causes Jake to seek sanctuary in his imagination -- from his wise
and humorous sister, Karen (Kavner), and his eccentric analyst,
Edith (Van Patten).  
<P>
Jake also travels back in time to his first marriage and to his
cherished Julie (Sorvino) who died in a car crash.  They had a
child, Molly (Williams), to whom Jake is devoted.  Maggie knows
Jake is haunted by thoughts of Julie and that she is <I>wife number
two</I>.
<P>
As the separation period progresses, Jake recognizes his loss
-- as does Maggie.  Their predicament is aptly summarized by Maggie
when she says, &quot;We're like two people reaching out for each
other with both hands tied behind our backs.&quot;
<P>
Experience Neil Simon at his Pulitzer Prize-winning best as he
touches our hearts while making us laugh.  <I><B>Jake's Women</B></I>
airs <U>Sunday, March 3, 1996, at 9:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>,
simulcast/<B>CBS</B>.

<P>
What really goes on inside the faculty lounge of a contemporary
junior high school?  Get a witty, insightful look when the new
comedy series, <I><B>The Faculty</B></I>, premieres <U>Wednesday,
March 13, 1996, (8:30 - 9:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
<B>Meredith Baxter, Peter Michael Goetz, Constance Shulman, Peter
MacKenzie, Jenica Bergere, Nancy Lenehan</B> and <B>Kurt Fuller
</B>star.
<P>
In <I><B>The Faculty</B></I>, it is a triple toss up for assistant
vice principal Flynn Sullivan (Baxter) to determine which is more
difficult -- keeping her personal life afloat; dealing with her
malcontent, decidedly amusing teaching staff; or trying to inspire
the dispassionate students at Hamilton Middle School.
<P>
Helping Flynn face burnout, budget cuts, and discipline problems
are an off-centre group of co-workers including her best friend
Shelly (Shulman), an acerbic English teacher; Herb (Goetz), the
perpetually preoccupied principal; Herb's caustic and territorial
secretary, Daisy (Lenehan); a rookie teacher, Amanda (Bergere);
and Clark (MacKenzie), a conventional, buttoned-down history teacher
yearning to break out of his shell.   
<P>
 
<P>
There are days when Flynn Sullivan would rather turn her back
and walk away from her job, but her idealism always triumphs.
<P>
<I><B>The Faculty</B></I>, premieres <U>Wednesday, March 13, 1996,
at 9:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>, simulcast/<B>ABC</B>.

<H1>Show Topic <I>'SPANKING YOUR KIDS'</I> </H1>

<H2>Generates over 50,000 calls on<I> JANE HAWTIN LIVE! </I></H2>

</CENTER>

<P>
&quot;Spanking Your Kids&quot; was the topic discussed today,
January 31, 1996, on <I><B>Jane Hawtin Live!   </B></I>The controversial
theme struck a strong chord with viewers as the number of calls
generated totaled <B>50,648</B>.  Jane's guests on the show were
Kari Simpson from the Citizen's Research Institute (pro spanking)
and child psychologist Dr. David Day (against).
<P>
While this tally is the highest generated to date for a single
Jane Hawtin Live! show, the program is becoming accustomed to
generating large numbers of telephone calls.  For example, on
December 5, 1995, close to 41,000 people tried to call into Jane
Hawtin Live! to express their opinion on the topic of Legalizing
Marijuana.   Jane Hawtin Live!, which debuted August 28, 1995,
usually averages over 40,000 call attempts a week.  In less than
five months over 900,000 people have called 1-800-510-JANE. 
<P>
Show topics that have each received over 20,000 call attempts
or more include:
<UL>
<LI>Did Karla Homolka Get Away With Murder?
<LI>Capital Punishment
<LI>Lap Dancing
<LI>Abortion
<LI>Smoking -- Should Nicotine Be A Controlled Substance?
<LI>Gun Control
<LI>Quebec Referendum Day
<LI>Are Men Getting A Bad Rap
<LI>Day After Referendum -- Oui or Non
<LI>Schools Teaching About Gays and Lesbians 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Due to the overwhelming response on the 1-800 number, <I><B>Jane
Hawtin Live! </B></I>launched a 900 Poll Line on October 30, 1995.
 The <I>Yes/No Poll(</I>conducted two - three times a week),<I>
</I>provides immediate results allowing viewers to know at the
conclusion of the show, exactly where people have positioned themselves
on a given topic.  In addition, Friday's, <I><B>Jane Hawtin Live!
</B></I>features the<I><B> </B></I>best phone calls of the week,
the best letter and the best Internet mail message.
<P>
<I><B>Jane Hawtin Live!,</B></I> a co-production of <B>Westcom
TV Group Ltd. </B>and <B>Jane Hawtin Live Productions</B>, is
seen 1:00 - 2:00 p.m. on <B>CHCH-TV</B> in the Toronto market
and is simulcast with <B>Talk 640, BCTV</B> in Vancouver, <B>ITV</B>
in Edmonton, <B>CICT</B> in Calgary and on <B>2&amp;7 CISA</B>

<H1>CHCH-TV Seeks Ontario Expansion</H1>

</CENTER>

<P>
<B>CHCH-TV</B> has filed applications with the Canadian Radio-television
and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) seeking<B> </B>amendments
to its broadcast license which would allow rebroadcast transmitters
to be established in nine Ontario markets: London, Kingston, Peterborough,
Muskoka, North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, Timmins, and Thunder
Bay. 
<P>
The <B>CHCH</B> program schedule will provide these communities
with a significant amount of new programming options.  While <B>CHCH</B>
is available in a few of the markets on cable, on average 60 %
of the programs in the <B>CH</B> schedule are not seen in the
nine markets the station proposes to serve, including such programs
as <I>Highlander, The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Maple Leaf Hockey
on Eleven, Jane Hawtin Live!</I> and <I>Canada Tonight</I> --
<A HREF="../../wic/wic.htm">WIC Western International Communications Ltd.'s</A>
national newscast which originates from Vancouver.
<P>
These applications, combined with the station's previously filed
requests to establish a programming undertaking or rebroadcast
transmitter in Ottawa, would increase <B>CHCH-TV</B>'s coverage
of the province, permitting the station to fairly compete in a
market totally dominated by regional broadcast systems.
<P>
&quot;<B>CHCH-TV</B> competes in arguably the most competitive
television market in North America where the dominance of regional
systems and consolidated station ownership has inextricably changed
the competitive landscape of the marketplace. The Commission's
approval of these applications will ensure that <B>CHCH</B> is
able to compete equitably in the future and is of paramount importance
to the long term interests of <B>CHCH</B>,&quot; states Jim Macdonald,
president and chief executive officer, <B>CHCH-TV</B>. 
<P>
Most new viewing options come with a price tag and <B>CHCH</B>
is confident that the introduction of a new 'free' service, containing
a substantial selection of quality programming, will be well received.
<P>
<B>CHCH-TV</B> is owned by <B>WIC Western International Communications
Ltd</B>., and is a subsidiary of <B>Westcom TV Group Ltd</B>.
 <B>WIC</B> is an integrated Canadian communications, broadcast
and entertainment company with its head office in Vancouver, British
Columbia. <B>WIC</B> is the only Canadian broadcasting company
operating in television, pay television, radio and satellite network
services.

<H2>&quot;Cutting Edge: The Future of Crime Fighting&quot;</H2>

<H3>A ONE-HOUR SPECIAL ON CHCH-TV</H3>

</CENTER>

<P>
Tools and tactics used by criminals in the 1990s have turned hi-tech.
 Police are meeting the challenge of fighting modern day crime
by using  methods and weapons that appear to be borrowed from
science fiction.  <I><B>Cutting Edge: The Future of Crime Fighting</B></I>,
airing <U>Wednesday, February 21, 1996, (8:00 - 9:00 p.m.)</U>
on <B>CHCH-TV</B>, is about crime fighters and the weapons they
use to take back the streets. 
<P>
<I><B>Cutting Edge: The Future of Crime Fighting</B></I> will
take viewers to the front lines in the war on crime.  They will
fly in a super silent helicopter that chases fugitives without
being seen or heard; ride along with police and observe the forensic
team in action; and witness the drama of their first response
to a crime scene.
<P>
This hi-tech look at crime is divided into three parts:
<P>
<B> Action/Prevention </B>which<B> </B>examines the advanced tools
police use to stop crime or apprehend suspects.
<P>
<B> Investigation</B>, a two part exercise, leads off with the
crime scene, where 21st Century forensic technology is used to
gather critical evidence for analysis.  Then, the viewer is taken
to the Crime Lab where the evidence is examined, and where computers
and other highly evolved scientific equipment are utilized to
solve the most complicated of crimes.
<P>
 The <B>Future </B>segment looks at the unbelievable world of
weaponry and technologies that are just around the corner.
<P>
<I><B>Cutting Edge: The Future of Crime Fighting</B></I> airs
<U>Wednesday, February 21, 1996, at </U><U>8:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>, simulcast/<B>NBC</B>.

<H3>A NEW FOUR HOUR MINI-SERIES ON CHCH-TV</H3>

<P>
A well-liked teacher uses money and passion to manipulate three
vulnerable students into killing her husband in <I><B>Seduced
By Madness: The Diane Borchardt Story</B></I>, airing <U>Sunday,
February 25, 1996 (part one)</U>, and <U>Monday, February 26,
1996 (part two; 9:00 -11:00 p.m. both nights)</U>, on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
<B>Ann-Margret, Peter Coyote </B>and <B>Christian Campbell</B>
star in the four hour mini-series based on one of the most sensational
trials in recent history.
<P>
In <I><B>Seduced By Madness: The Diane Borchardt Story</B></I>,
the whole town knew Diane Borchardt (Ann-Margret), a popular high-school
teacher, was distressed by her impending divorce.  However, no
one knew she was plotting his murder.
<P>
Diane was obsessive and possessive -- obsessed with marriage and
family; possessed by  a jealous memory of her husband's first
wife, who died before they were married.   
<P>
When her eccentric behaviour prods her husband to seek a divorce,
she looks for accomplices to help her execute her plan.  She finds
three: Douglas Vest Jr., voted the &quot;sweetest boy at Jefferson
High&quot;; Joshua Yanke, a member of the school choir; and Michael
Maldonado, Vest's cousin.
<P>
In the end, one flaw in Diane Borchardt's meticulously planned
scheme prevents her from getting away with murder in, <I><B>Seduced
By Madness: The Diane Borchardt</B></I>, airing <U>Sunday, February,

After an expectant Kelly collapses during the protest, it is discovered
she has congenital heart disease.  Her physician recommends she
undergo a therapeutic abortion, as the strain of the fetus could
send her into massive cardiac arrest.  Kelly and her husband Stan
(McNamara) reject the suggestion and shortly thereafter, Kelly
signs a statement voluntarily refusing treatment.
<P>
Liz pleads with Kelly to reverse her decision, arguing that a
man and children will be left without a wife and mother if she
proceeds.  Eventually, even Kelly's husband and father begin to
reconsider the abortion issue, however, Kelly stands steadfast.
<P>
Liz then files a lawsuit against Kelly, citing abandonment as
the reason.  A few days into trial, Kelly is again hospitalized,
but the trial proceeds in her absence with the judge ruling in
her favour.   
<P>
Seven months into the pregnancy, Kelly suffers cardiac arrest
with only one person able to assist her -- Liz.   Kelly loses
her baby, but survives open heart surgery.   During a painful
period, it is Liz who makes Stan love his dead child, and over
time, the sisters reconcile.   <I><B>A Case For Life</B></I> airs
<U>Sunday, February 18, 1996, at 9:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV,</B>
simulcast/<B>ABC. </B>

The life of the only living alien, Alf, is put in jeopardy when
the army tries to determine if he should live or die. Eventually,
good wins out over evil in <I><B>Project Alf</B></I>, airing <U>Saturday,

and <B>Ray Walston </B>star.
<P>
 
<P>
In <I><B>Project Alf</B></I>, the military must resolve whether
they will let Alf live or die.  One army major (Sheen) is of the
opinion that Alf is a tremendous threat and needs to be terminated.
 However, another major and captain (Daggett and O'Leary) believe
Alf is a fine character, who could offer insight into relations
with other aliens.
<P>
As the comedic mayhem unfolds, Alf's life is ultimately placed
in peril, particularly when the major and captain sneak him off
base and take him to the residence of a former astronaut (Ferrar).
 This former astronaut, as it turns out, has a vendetta against
the government and plots to sell Alf to the top bidder.

the long-running half-hour television series a delight, airs <U>Saturday,

Two medical researchers uncover a diabolical money-making plot
of a prestigious cancer centre, exposing disturbing moral issues
that impact on the medical profession in <I><B>Robin Cook's Terminal</B></I>,

In <I><B>Robin Cook's Terminal</B></I>, Sean O'Grady (Savant),

<H3>Premiere on CHCH-TV</H3>

</CENTER>

<P>
<B>CHCH-TV</B> is pleased to announce the acquisition of <I><B>World's
Funniest Videos</B></I>, premiering <U>Thursday, February 1, 1996
(8:00- 8:30 p.m.)</U>, and <I><B>Second Noah</B></I>, debuting
<U>Monday, February 5, 1996 (8:00 - 9:00 p.m.)</U>. 
<P>
From the producers of the hit series, <I>America's Funniest Home
Videos</I>, comes the <I><B>World's Funniest Videos</B></I>, hosted
by <B>Dave Coulier</B> (<I>Full House</I>) and <B>Eva La Rue</B>
(<I>All My Children</I>).  This new television series, shot on
location at Florida's Epcot Center before a live audience at an
outdoor amphitheatre, will feature never-before-seen videos sent
from viewers from around the world.  Airing weekly, <I><B>World's
Funniest Videos </B></I>premieres <U>Thursday, February 1, 1996,
at 8:00 p.m.</U>, simulcast/<B>ABC</B>.

<B>Deidre O'Connell</B> (<I>Sirens, Leaving Normal</I>) and <B>Jimmy
Marsden</B> (<I>The Nanny, Ambush in Waco</I>), is about the extraordinary
Beckett family.   
<P>
Noah Beckett (Kelly), a famous Tampa University basketball coach
and writer, has put his life on hold to raise their six adopted
children, ranging in age from a three-year-old baby to a girl
crazy teen, and their 40 pets, which include ferrets, iguanas
and a pot-bellied pig.   Meanwhile, his wife, Jesse (Brantley),
has her hands full as the Florida Zoo's veterinarian.
<P>
However, despite their eclectic home setting, the Becketts always
seem to have room for one more, which is what a homeless 17-year-old
girl counts on when she abandons her brother at the zoo.   As
hoped, the Becketts take the boy in, and eventually, his lonesome
sister, too.
<P>
Add to the household an abrasive, gregarious, take-charge kind
of woman (O'Connell), who answers the Beckett's ad to become their
tenth housekeeper, and viewers get a new kind of loving family
who can handle almost anything.  <I><B>Second Noah </B></I>premieres
<U>Monday, February 5, 1996, at 8:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>,
simulcast/<B>ABC</B>.

<H1>&quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot;</H1>

</CENTER>

<P>
A 400- year-old ghost, doomed to haunt an old castle, befriends
a young girl who travels  to the Other World to plead his case
before the Angel of Death, thus setting him free to rest in peace
in <I><B>The Canterville Ghost</B></I>, airing <U>Saturday, January
27, 1996 (9:00-11:00 p.m.),</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
<B>Patrick Stewart, Neve Campbell, Ed Wiley</B> and <B>Cherie
Lunghi</B> star in the two-hour television movie.
<P>
In <I><B>The Canterville Ghost</B></I>, Professor Otis accepts
a research grant to study in England, leaving his wife and children
ecstatic that they get the chance to live in a real English castle,
Canterville Hall.   Upon their arrival, the children, 16-year-old
Virginia Otis (Campbell) and her two younger brothers, learn that
the most remarkable feature about the residence is Sir Simon de
Canterville (Stewart), a 400-year-old ghost, visible only to them.
<P>
Proper introductions once made, the terrifying facade of Sir Simon
melts to reveal a amiable fellow who advises Virginia on her budding
romance with a young neighbour.  He even concedes to playing Hamlet
-- the role of the ghost, naturally.  Comfortable with their friendship,
Sir Simon eventually discloses his dilemma to Virginia: he is
sentenced to inhabit the castle unless he can convince a &quot;Golden
Girl&quot; to plead his case before the Angel of Death.  Virginia
immediately agrees and follows him through the fireplace.
<P>
    
<P>
The following day, just as the Otises are starting to panic, Virginia
reappears, content in the fact that Sir Simon has finally been
released to rest in peace next to his beloved wife.  Further to
this good news, Professor Otis announces his acceptance of a permanent
teaching post in England, and that the family will remain at Canterville
Hall.

restaurant to support herself and her son, Matt (Jackson). However,
Kay is in a dilemma as their home is about to go into foreclosure.

Then, Tommy Town (Schneider) arrives on the scene.  He has come
looking for Kay's deceased husband who had previously agreed to
work for him on a mining operation on a dormant silver mine known
as the Ruby Silver.  When he discovers her husband is dead, he

The four make the perilous journey to the Ruby Silver, but what

<H3>A Compelling Adventure on CHCH-TV</H3>

</CENTER>

<P>
On an 1100 mile dog sled race across the storm riddled wilds of
Alaska, the primary danger for racers is usually the real possibility
of freezing to death.  However, when two top contenders are murdered,
a young woman's chances for survival become even more desperate
as she races for her life against a killer in <I><B>Survival in
the Snow</B></I>, a two-hour movie airing <U>Tuesday, January

Damian</B> (<I>The Young and The Restless</I>) star.
<P>
In <I><B>Survival in the Snow</B></I>, Jessie Arnold is a woman
who has already raced in the Iditarod, an 1100 mile dog sled race
from Anchorage to Nome which tests the skill, stamina and courage
of all participants.  Having lost on the trail years before, and
almost dying from exposure, Jessie vowed never to race again.
 Instead, her brother, Rob, was to drive the breed of dogs that
Jessie had raised for the Iditarod.  When a tragic accident takes
his life days before the event, Jessie, in great need of the $50,000
prize money in order to maintain custody of her 12-year-old son,
pushes aside her fear to race herself.
<P>
The natural risks of the race are compounded when two of the top
drivers fall victim to questionable, fatal calamities.   Jessie,
who knew the dead victims, is certain they were killed and becomes
convinced that her brother's death was also the result of cold-blooded
murder.
<P>
As Jessie reaches the final lap in the grueling race, she finds
herself one of the three leading participants.  It is then her
instincts tell her that one of the other two top contenders is
the murderer, with his sights set on her as his next victim.
<P>
The stakes for the 1100 mile Iditarod Trail race have never been
higher as Jessie fights for  sheer <I><B>Survival in the Snow</B></I>,
a suspense-filled drama airing <U>Tuesday, January 9, 1996, at

 Amanda, a little girl of six, wishes for a grandfather for Christmas.
 In a strange and magical way, her wish is granted.  
<P>
Elmer (Rooney), a petty thief is caught breaking into a car. 
The stiff-lipped owner, Reg, who lacks any kind of sentiment,
allows Elmer to work for him doing odd jobs to compensate for
the damages.  Reg's daughter, Amanda, and Elmer are immediately
drawn to each other.  Plus Amanda thinks Santa brought her a grandfather
for Christmas.
<P>
In reality he did.  When Elmer discovers that Reg is the son he
never met, he flees in shame, not wanting the secret to be revealed.
 Distressed by Elmer's sudden departure, Amanda follows him onto
the tough city streets.  Only a miracle and perhaps a loving grandfather
will be able to find her.

<P>
A youth, charmed by the wisdom and generosity of a feisty 80-year-old
homeless man, pursues a relationship with the fellow that leaves
his life enriched as his old friend relinquishes his.  The bitter-sweet
drama, <I><B>Christmas on Division Street</B></I>, airs <U>Tuesday,

Ellison, Kahla Lichti</B> and <B>Badja Djola</B> star.  
<P>
In <I><B>Christmas On Division Street</B></I>, 14-year-old Trevor
Atwood (Savage), still suffering the loss of his grandfather,
fails to share his family's excitement about their move to Philadelphia.
 The transition is made more difficult when Derek (Ellison), the
school jokester feels it his duty to torment the &quot;new guy.&quot;
 Then, one day while in the library researching information for
a history paper, Trevor encounters Cleveland Meriwether (Cronyn),
an elderly homeless man and self-proclaimed &quot;Minister of
Education.&quot;  His personality and exhaustive knowledge of
American history win Trevor over.
<P>
As the story unfolds, Trevor pursues a complex friendship with
Cleveland, a man besieged with drinking problems after causing
the death of a boy in an auto accident years ago.   
<P>
So enamored with Cleveland is Trevor that he is unwilling to desert
him no matter the outcome.  Even after Cleveland rejects their
friendship, a lie initiated by a social worker, Trevor refuses
to stop caring for the man who would leave him with wonderful
memories and numerous examples of magnanimity: like the time Trevor
was stranded in the rain without train fare and Cleveland sold
his blood to give him the train fare; or the time Cleveland distributed
among the neighbourhood's needy, a sack of clothing Trevor had
brought for him; and so sweet was the time the two walked the
streets through the season's first snowfall when Cleveland landed
a job, temporarily.
<P>
Only after Cleveland's death, does the essence of the holiday
season take on a new and profound  meaning for Trevor and his
family.   <I><B>Christmas on Division Street</B></I>, a Westcom
Entertainment Group production, airs <U>Tuesday, December 19,

A tough business woman, who has lost sight of the important things
in life, experiences a Christmas haunting which leaves her with
a renewed appreciation for love, goodness and compassion in <I><B>Ebbie
</B></I>(aka <I>Ms. Scrooge</I>), airing <U>Tuesday, December

favourite, &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; are <B>Susan Lucci,

<P>
In <I><B>Ebbie</B></I>, Elizabeth &quot;Ebbie&quot; Scrooge (Lucci)
is a shrewd CEO of Dobson's Department Store.  Her rise to the
top has been achieved through difficult decision-making and personal
sacrifices that have succeeded in her obtaining a powerful position,

important people in her life.  
<P>
Then, on one Christmas Eve, Ebbie is visited by a colourful cast
of midnight visitors who take her on an emotional journey through
her past, present and future.   Reliving her former heartaches

<P>
Based on a best-selling novel by <B>Danielle Steel</B>, <I><B>Mixed

are challenged when they have to face such serious issues as infertility,

One couple, for example, are childless because the husband is
impotent -- a secret hidden from his wife, who is pregnant.  Another
couple are incapable of having children and risk seeing their

may be their only hope.   The third pair of partners desperately
want children, but postpone having a baby due to an interfering

<H1>BYE BYE BIRDIE</H1>

<H3>A MUSICAL CLASSIC ON CHCH-TV</H3>

</CENTER>

<P>
A publicity stunt invented for a  popular, hip-gyrating rock-n-roll
star is filled with hilarious complications in one of America's
best-loved musicals, <I><B>Bye Bye Birdie</B></I>.  The new adaptation
for television of this venerable favourite airs <U>Sunday, December
3, 1995, (8:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
<B>Jason Alexander, Tyne Daly, Vanessa Williams, Chynna Phillips,
George Wendt</B> and <B>Marc Kudisch</B> star in the delightful
parody of '50s sensation Elvis Presley . 
<P>
In <I><B>Bye Bye Birdie</B></I>, Conrad Birdie (Kudisch) is an
adored, singing phenomenon.  On the eve of his joining the Army,
his manager, Albert (Alexander), and his devout secretary, Rosie
(Williams), arrange for Conrad to make a final appearance on <I>The
Ed Sullivan Show</I>.  The plan is to have Conrad  bestow a &quot;last
kiss&quot; on a sweet, innocent-faced youth 
<P>
-- Kim MacAfee (Phillips) -- on a national live telecast originating
from Sweet Apple, Ohio.
<P>
The scheme, simple enough in premise, becomes fraught with problems,
which are compounded by Kim's disapproving father (Wendt) and
the arrival of Albert's meddlesome mother (Daly) in Sweet Apple,
who frantically tries to put a halt to Rosie and Albert's developing
romance.    
<P>
Composer Charles Strouse and lyricist Lee Adams created the character
Conrad Birdie.  Many of the great songs that live on from their
beloved musical include &quot;An English Teacher,&quot;  &quot;How
Lovely to be a Woman,&quot; &quot;We Love You, Conrad,&quot; 
&quot;Honestly Sincere,&quot; &quot;One Last Kiss,&quot; &quot;A
Lot of Living To Do,&quot; &quot;Spanish Rose,&quot; and &quot;Put
on a Happy Face.&quot;
<P>
The spirited three-hour television adaptation of <I><B>Bye Bye
Birdie</B></I> airs <U>Sunday, December 3, 1995, at 8:00 p.m.</U>
on <B>CHCH-TV </B>(simulcast/ABC).

A woman who survives a brutal attack by a serial killer tirelessly
crusades for legislation to keep her assailant behind bars when
he is paroled and once again threatens her life. <I><B>Fight For

<P>
<I><B>Fight For Justice: The Nancy Conn Story</B></I>, based on
a true story, is about Nancy Conn (Henner), a hard working, single
mother of two teens (Keegan and Jakub) who, despite her hectic
schedule, still manages to take several classes at the local university.
On one such occasion, while hurrying across campus, a man -- Richard
Ellard -- collides with her. Never does she anticipate that this
random encounter would result in a terrifying nightmare.
<P>
While out with her cousin (Gilpin) one evening, Nancy again runs
into Ellard, only this time he is wild-eyed and brandishing a
knife. Forcing the two women into his car, he drives to a remote
area, assaults them, then leaves them for dead. Nancy, however,
lives to identify Ellard who is subsequently arrested and convicted.
When he is later paroled and seeks retaliation against Nancy,
she relentlessly campaigns to keep Ellard off the streets.

<H1><CENTER><I><B>THE GREAT MOM SWAP</CENTER></B></I></H1>

<P>
Two teenage girls with nothing in common, except for the contempt
they share for each other's lifestyle, learn a lesson in tolerance,
respect and friendship in<I><B> The Great Mom Swap,</B></I> airing
<U>Sunday, September 24, 1995, (9:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
<B>Shelly Fabares</B> (<I>Coach</I>), <B>Valerie Harper </B>(<I>Rhoda</I>),
and the legendary<B> Sid Caesar</B> star in the two-hour movie
along with<B> Hillary Tuck </B>(<I>Camp Nowhere</I>) and <B>Mary
Kate Schellhardt </B>(<I>Apollo 13, Free Willy II</I>).
<P>
In <I><B>The Great Mom Swap</B></I>, Terry Benessi and Karen Ridgeway
are two young girls with a strong dislike for each other.  Terry
is the bookish, bright, unpopular girl from &quot;the wrong side
of town.&quot;  Karen, by contrast, lacks academic prowess, is
popular and comes from an affluent family.
<P>
When their mutual animosity results in the potential burning down
of the school, they are given a choice: expulsion and a month
at a work camp, or 50 hours of community service while trading
families for a month.  The pair opt for the latter.
<P>
Karen is humiliated to be seen in Terry's neighbourhood, and quicker
than she feared, her so-called friends desert her.  Having to
relinquish a loving household for a sterile mansion, Terry discovers
that Karen's life is not exactly a fairy tale.  And, when the
two are forced to work together as a team for their community
service assignment, their reaction is one of more antagonism.
<P>
Filled with poignant humour and lessons in pride and regard for
others, <I><B>The Great Mom Swap</B></I> is a delightful, contemporary
<I>&quot;Prince and the Pauper&quot; </I>frolic.  <I><B>The Great
Mom Swap </B></I>airs <U>Sunday, September 24, 1995, at 9:00 p.m.</U>

<P>
<B>Biography</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
Fran Drescher stars as Fran Fine, the saucy, outspoken nanny,
in TriStar Television's half-hour comedy series <I><B>The Nanny</B></I>.
<P>
Fran, born and raised in Queens, New York, wanted to be an actress
from the time she was a child. She attended Hillcrest High School,
a career-oriented school, and studied drama. She met her husband,
Peter Marc Jacobson, in the drama club and they have been together
ever since.
<P>
After a year at Queen's College, Fran and Peter decided they needed
a practical trade to fall back on and entered cosmetology school.
After receiving their licenses, they opened a mini-salon giving
$5.00 haircuts.
<P>
Fran's first feature film role was in &quot;Saturday Night Fever.&quot;
Her other film credits include &quot;American Hot Wax,&quot; &quot;Garp,&quot;
&quot;The Hollywood Knights,&quot; &quot;Ragtime,&quot; &quot;Cadillac
Man,&quot; &quot;Serious Money&quot; and &quot;It Had To Be You.&quot;
Her role in the cult classic &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; won
her a &quot;five minute Oscar&quot; from Esquire Magazine.
<P>
She starred in the series &quot;Princesses&quot; and has guest
starred on television in &quot;Alf,&quot; &quot;Night Court,&quot;
&quot;Nine to Five,&quot; &quot;Fame,&quot; &quot;The Tracey Ullman
Show&quot; and &quot;Civil Wars.&quot; Fran also co-starred in
the television movies &quot;Love and Betrayal&quot; and &quot;Terror
in the Towers.&quot;
<P>
Fran, who co-created, wrote and produced <I><B>The Nanny</B></I>
with her husband Peter, still finds outlets for her entrepreneurial
spirit. She and Peter are partners in a gourmet food line which
produces Loaf and Kisses Gourmet Croutons. &quot;The 1988 writer's
strike was the catalyst that got us started,&quot; she explains.
<P>
Fran, born September 30, lives in Los Angeles.

<P>
Benjamin Salisbury co-stars as Brighton Sheffield, a very clever
youngster with a talent for mischief, in TriStar Television's
half-hour comedy series <I><B>The Nanny</B></I>.
<P>
Benjamin, born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, discovered acting when
he was nine years old and attended a community play with friends.
&quot;I came home and told my mother I wanted to be in a play
and I auditioned for the next production,&quot; he says. He won
a role in a production of &quot;Sleeping Beauty, the Musical&quot;
in which he not only acted for the first time, but also sang and
danced.
<P>
The youngster captured the attention of an agent and moved quickly
into professional acting. He appeared in industrial films and
commercials and also in two productions of 'The Nutcracker,&quot;
with the Cincinnati Ballet Company and The Joffrey Ballet.
<P>
Benjamin also appeared in the feature films &quot;Captain Ron,&quot;
'The Mighty Ducks&quot; and &quot;Iron Will.&quot; His first television
appearance was on the American Playhouse Theatre in &quot;And
the Earth Did Not Swallow Him.&quot;
<P>
Benjamin, who lives in Plymouth, Minnesota, plays the piano and
dances when he is not in front of the cameras. He also plays Little
League and is a Boy Scout. His favorite subject in school is social
studies because of his interest in politics.

<HR>

<H3>Omnibus Hearing </H3>

<P>
A national senior citizen's group says Ontario is the slowest
of all provinces to approve new drugs on the market. 
<P>
The charge came on the last day of public hearings on the omnibus
bill before the new year. 
<HR>

<H3>OPSEU Pensions</H3>

<P>
And the union representing Ontario public servants says if bill
26 passes, it will allow the Harris government to &quot;loot&quot;
their pension plan... and &quot;cheat&quot; them out of millions.

<P>
This after a court ruling overturned a cabinet order exempting
the government from topping up pensions of laid off civil servants.
OPSEU President Leah Casselman says the Tories are now trying
to block access to millions of dollars in pension funds through
the proposed omnibus bill. 
<HR>

<H3>St. Thomas Shooting</H3>

<P>
A 42-year-old man is in hospital in critical condition after he
was shot in the stomach early today at his country home just south
of St. Thomas. 
<P>
Another man... believed to be a factory co-worker of the victim
is charged with attempted murder. Brian Crocker was shot at more
than once ... and 44-year- old Robert Woodford of Malahide Township
is the man accused of firing those shots. 
<P>
He will remain in custody through Christmas. Police have not yet
determined a possible motive. 
<HR>

<H3>Unruly Mob </H3>

<P>
Guelph police used pepper spray to break up a brawl outside a
bar this morning. 
<P>
Police say trouble started when two men started throwing punches
inside the palace hotel. More fights started when about 250 people
spilled out onto the street. 
<P>
Eighteen police officers were sent to the bar and a nearby parking
lot. The crowd was so unruly that city police called in reinforcements
from nearby OPP detachments. 
<P>
Three men were detained by police. Twenty- year-old Michael Lumber
of Georgetown and 25-year-old Steve Nadalin of Fergus are charged
with causing a disturbance. 
<HR>

<H3>Barrie Fire</H3>

<P>
An early morning fire has razed a storage barn full of equipment
used for the Barrie fair. 
<P>
The blaze sent thick black clouds billowing over highway 400.
More than two dozen firefighters battled flames that punched a
hole through the roof of the building at the Barrie Fairgrounds.

<P>
No one was injured. The cause of the fire hasn't been determined.

<HR>

<H3>Jose Castro Out </H3>

<P>
A Portuguese man responsible for a deadly hit-and- run accident
in Toronto was released from jail today after serving one-third
of his one-year sentence. 
<P>
Jose Castro returned to Canada from his home in Portugal to face
trial. Castro was convicted of leaving the scene of an accident
after he ran over and killed seven-year-old Kara Parman in 1993.
He returned to Toronto last March, saying he was haunted by the
little girl's death and ashamed of his flight. 
<HR>

<H3>Coyote Bodies </H3>

<P>
There was a grisly discovery in Mississauga last night. Someone
found a bag containing the carcasses of three coyotes. Two had
been skinned while one was intact. 
<P>
Animal control officers are not sure if the coyotes were in fact
from the area or had simply been dumped there by a hunter or farmer.
Police were called in and are investigating. 
<HR>

<H3>Salsa Guy </H3>

<P>
The city of Guelph is a little spicier these days ... thanks to
some fancy salsa work by a Chilean native. 
<P>
He's turned a favourite recipe into a lucrative business, selling
his salsa at stores in Guelph and also at farmers markets in Guelph,
Kitchener and Toronto. Annette Hamm reports. 
<P>
<I>Rodolfo Hennings always knew he had salsa in his heart. Now
he's pouring his heart out for a living. </I>
<P>
<I>His fresh Chilean Salsa has been a long time favourite at parties,
but it wasn't until last March that Hennings decided to take the
plunge, leaving his job as a machinist. </I>
<P>
<I>But a salsa maker he is. Six days a week, Rodolfo enlists his
friends and family for help in the kitchen. Onions are chopped
on Mondays, tomatoes on Tuesdays, then garlic, coriander, lemon
and a mix of spices are prepared on Wednesday and Thursday. Friday
is when it all comes together, and Saturday they go to market.
And not a batch is packaged from this spicy storefront without
a taste from the chef. </I>
<P>
<I>Little by little, Rodolfo is trying to mass produce those flavors
of Chile a little faster and easier, but he's willing to put in
a lot of elbow grease to make it taste just right. All he really
has to worry about it keeping up with demand. </I>
<P>
<I>In Guelph, Annette Hamm, Channel 11 News. </I>

<H3>Missing Child</H3>

<P>
A mother and stepfather from Stevens Point, Wisconsin, are pulling
out all the stops, leaving no stone unturned in the quest to find
their daughter. 
<P>
Jessica Mullenberg was abducted last September... and may have
been sighted recently in waterloo. 
<P>
<I>Monica and Jake Bourget are on a quest to find Monica's daughter
... who police believe was abducted from Eau Claire Wisconsin
last September by a family friend. </I>
<P>
<I>The FBI and police in Eau Claire say there's a good possibility
13-year-old Jessica Mullenberg was brought to the Waterloo area
by 38-year-old Paul Oliver. A man and girl fitting the description
of the two were spotted by several people. </I>
<P>
<I>Jessica disappeared in September after Oliver received permission
from her father to take her to a work project. </I>
<P>
<I>Posters featuring their pictures are being be distributed in
the Kitchener- Waterloo and Cambridge areas. Anthony Pooley ...
Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Love Canal Update</H3>

<P>
Occidental Chemicals has agreed to pay 129-million dollars US
to cover Washington's cleanup costs at New York State's Love Canal.

<P>
It was dug in the 1890's for an abandoned Hydro-power project
in upstate New York, and became a dump site during the second
world war. Twenty-two- thousand tons of chemical waste was buried
there from 1942 to 1953. 
<P>
Love Canal attracted attention in the late 1970's and early 1980's
when hundreds of families from the Niagara falls, New York neighborhood
were forced to leave their homes. 
<HR>

<H3>Harris-Jobs </H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris says his deepest regret about 1995 is that
Ontario was shortchanged on job creation. 
<P>
But Harris still predicts he will exceed his goal of 725-thousand
jobs over the next three years. 
<HR>

<H3>Plane Crash </H3>

<P>
Rescuers used chain saws today to rescue a girl who survived a
fiery American Airlines crash in Colombia. 
<P>
The girl, who is one of four survivors, is trapped under a fallen
tree. 
<P>
The Boeing 7-57 smashed into a mountain near Cali last night on
a flight from Miami. there were 164 people... mostly Colombians
... on board. FBI agents and a team of Boeing engineers are headed
to the crash site to help investigate. 
<HR>

<H3>Angola Crash</H3>

<P>
More than 80 children were killed in a Zairian charter plane which
crashed in Angola earlier this week. 
<P>
The fact that the tragedy occurred was not revealed until today.
141 people in all died in the crash. Overloading on the Lockheed
188 Electra appears to have been the cause of the crash. 
<HR>

<H3>Train Wreck </H3>

<P>
At least 75 people have died in a train wreck near Cairo. Egyptian
officials say more than 100 were injured when one train plowed
into the rear of another in heavy fog. 
<P>
Emergency crews are still swarming over the twisted wreckage looking
for survivors... and bodies. 
<HR>

<H3>Hamilton Place-CPI</H3>

<P>
It may be a major scam... perpetrated on concert goers, and the
artists they paid to see. 
<P>
The former owners of Concert Productions International; or CPI
... are the targets of a growing fraud investigation involving
phony taxes collected from venues; that were legally tax exempt.
As Scot Urquhart reports; one of the venues involved ... was Hamilton
Place: 
<P>
<I>Michael Cole says, it's a lie ... and he is going after the
Toronto Star.</I>
<P>
<I>Cole and his partner Arthur Fogel; were the target of a newspaper
investigation; which claims the pair routinely charged a ten percent
entertainment tax to artists playing at the CNE, O'Keefe Centre
and Hamilton Place ... even though the venues were tax exempt.
</I>
<P>
<I>Debra Vivian of HECFI ... the body which operates Hamilton
Place theatre says, her organization had no part in the alleged
scheme: but she admits; Cole and Fogel could easily have withheld
a ten percent tax, without the knowledge of HECFI.</I>
<P>
<I>But Cole says; they never collected any taxes at Hamilton Place;
and reports to the contrary; are completely false. </I>
<P>
<I>The two men recently sold their interest in Concert Productions
International. However, they will still be the subject of a Metro
Toronto Police fraud investigation, and in their own defence they
will launch a libel suit against the newspaper; which Cole says
will run, into double digit millions. </I>
<P>

<H3>Big Birds </H3>

<P>
A big bird could be coming soon to a supermarket near you. Low
in fat and cholesterol and high in protein and iron, this new
product could catch on fast with those watching what they eat.
Annette Hamm reports. 
<P>
<I>This bin of red meat in an Ancaster supermarket is raising
a lot of questions ... mainly, what is it?</I>
<P>
<I>It's Emu, part of the fastest growing livestock industry in
north America. Sobey's of Ancaster is the only retail store in
Ontario selling this meat. The supermarket is doing a pilot for
the Emu Association, but plans to keep selling the product after
the pilot is over. </I>
<P>
<I>Although Millen says sales haven't been that great the first
two weeks Emu has been in the store, Emu producers could easily
catch consumers on the wave of healthy eating. Emu is higher in
protein and high than either beef or chicken, and it's lower in
cholesterol and fat. The big drawback is the price. Emu producer
Dave Doxey explains part of the high price is because their marketing
is still in its infancy. </I>
<P>
<I>With only 400 farms in Ontario, producers can't keep up. Doxey
says he doesn't want Emu to compete with chicken or beef, he simply
wants to provide an alternative to other meats on the market.
In three to five years, he predicts as more consumers become aware
of Emu, the price will eventually fall. </I>
<P>

shooting outside a Toronto Chinese restaurant early last Sunday
morning in which a man was shot to death. 
<P>
Police raided a residence in Toronto's Jane-Finch area and took
several suspects into custody. 
<P>
Charged is 20-year-old Tien Dung Duang. He'll appear in court
tomorrow morning for a bail hearing.
<HR>

<H3>Prostitute Prof </H3>

<P>
Ryerson University says it found no evidence that part time journalism
instructor Gerald Hannon breached the limits of academic expression
in the classroom by espousing views supporting pedophilia. 
<P>
Hannon has been reinstated and will resume his duties next month.
He was also investigated by the University over comments about
his work as a prostitute. 
<P>
Ryerson says an investigation showed Hannon breached the collective
agreement and will be given a letter of discipline. 
<HR>

<H3>Harris - Tax Cut </H3>

<P>
It would seem that Premier Mike Harris is backing off somewhat
on his promise of a 30-percent provincial income tax cut to Ontarians.
Harris is now saying the wealthy will not get the tax break. 
<HR>

<H3>McLeod-Omnibus</H3>

<P>
Liberal Leader Lyn McLeod has called for an extension of public
hearings on Bill 26,called the &quot;omnibus bill.&quot; 
<P>
But Premier Mike Harris says &quot;no&quot;. The hearings are
being held all this week at Queens Park, and then will take to
the road for two weeks in January before being passed into law
January 29th. 
<P>
The hearings have become so popular that Liberal Leader Lyn McLeod
has written to Premier Harris, asking him to extend the hearings.
But Harris says no. 
<HR>

<H3>McLeod-Omnibus Tag</H3>

<P>
The deal the opposition parties agreed to, actually provide for
60 hours less hearing time than the government originally planned.

<HR>

<H3>Handover Wrap</H3>

<P>
NATO troops are quickly taking up their positions in Bosnia now
that their official mission has begun. 
<P>
The United Nations handed over the peacekeeping mission to allied
forces today. 
<HR>

<H3>Unpaid Work</H3>

<P>
Imagine getting paid for all the chores you do. Collecting a cheque
for things like washing the dishes or taking out the garbage.
Well, Statistics Canada has released a report that puts a dollar
amount to the 25-billion hours of unpaid work Canadians have put
in. 
<P>
Reporter Marci Ien brings us the facts and figures. 
<P>
<I>It's women who do most of the shopping, cleaning and other
chores ...in fact Stats- Can puts the number at 65 per-cent. But
research also shows more women are entering the paid labour market.
And that means families have more income.</I>
<P>
<I>Many use the extra cash to help out with the chores...and with
the children. In fact, spending on child care outside the home
increased to 2.8 billion in 1992. ...and that makes daycare one
of the fastest growing items of household expenditure. </I>
<P>
<I>But for those who put in double duty at home and at work...health
can be an issue. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton, Marci Ien, Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Garbage Dump</H3>

<P>
Two committees of metro Toronto council have rejected a proposal
to buy the Adams Mine site near Kirkland Lake to store Toronto's
garbage. 
<P>
The committees will recommend council seek a private sector solution
to its garbage woes. The proposal was considered too expensive
for the municipality. 
<P>
Mine owner Gordon McGuinty says the decision surprised him because
some metro officials recommended keeping all options open.

<H3>Omnibus Hearing 2 </H3>

<P>
The province's teachers say the Harris government's omnibus bill
takes Ontario to the brink of dictatorship. And the Toronto board
of trade thinks user fees are just the ticket for keeping municipal
costs down. 
<HR>

<H3>Bill 26 - Doctors </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile... Ontario doctors may stage some job action to protest
the omnibus bill. 
<P>
Ontario Medical Association President Dr. Ian Warrack couldn't
say if that would involve a strike. The OMA predicts doctors could
also leave the province and Canada in growing numbers. 
<P>
The OMA appeared before public hearings on the omnibus bill in
Toronto today. the group's counter-attack came a day after Health
Minister Jim Wilson suggested doctors have inflated the cost of
health care. 
<HR>

<H3>Bronx Shooting</H3>

<P>
New York City police say two more people have died in a shoe-store
shooting in the Bronx. That brings the death toll to six. One
of the dead is a boy age 12 or 13. It's not clear if the dead
were customers or employees. 
<P>
The suspect was shot and critically wounded by police in a gunfight
outside the store. Police describe the incident as a robbery gone
awry. They say the gunman entered the store, announced a holdup
and began shooting. 
<P>
Less than two weeks ago eight people were killed in Harlem when
a gunman opened fire in a clothing store and then set fire to
the building. 
<HR>

<H3>Kids - Violence </H3>

<P>
Call them soft targets. They are easy to hit, and easy to destroy.

<P>
We aren't talking about the war in Bosnia ... we're talking about
the children; inside Canadian homes. Scot Urquhart has more: 
<P>
<I>The story is all too common... in Hamilton ... a father of
two, locks his children in the car inside a rented storage locker
... and all of them die. In Cambridge a two year old toddler chokes
to death; in a botched exorcism. In Toronto... a father pours
gasoline over his children and their home ... and sets a townhouse
on fire ... </I>
<P>
<I>Statistics Canada says; children under the age of eleven are
at serious risk in this country ... and the homicide rate for
children under the age of one ... is twice that of the adult Staff
Sergeant Mike Shea says; </I>
<P>
<I>The Child Abuse Branch of the Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police
has seen a marked increase in the number of reported cases of
violence against children and more often than not ... strangers
are not involved.</I>
<P>
<I>At the Community Child Abuse Council of Hamilton Wentworth
... Brenda Symons Moulton, deals with the problems, every day.
The council says the keys to stopping the violence are prevention,
and support. </I>
<P>
<I>But while families, friends and neighbours may be able to help
more ... the government is about to do less: and if society can't
protect the defenseless ... who can? In Hamilton, Scot Urquhart,
Channel Eleven News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Zundel- Droege- Court </H3>

<P>
Holocaust revisionist Ernst Zundel and Heritage Front founder
Wolfgang Droege appeared in court in Toronto today in separate
cases. 
<P>
Zundel has been charged by a holocaust survivor with promoting
hatred. his hearing was rescheduled to February. 
<P>
Droege is charged with criminal contempt of a federal court order
not to put hate messages on the Heritage Front's telephone hotline
back in January. Droege may be back in court late next month if
lawyers in the case can agree on a date. 
<HR>

<H3>Angola Plane Crash</H3>

<P>
A chartered plane flying from Zaire to Angola has crashed in a
remote region of Angola, killing 139 of the 144 people on board.
<P>
The plane crashed Monday night, but the incident was not reported
until Tuesday evening. Details were vague, but transport officials
in Zaire said most of the passengers were Angolans. A spokesman
is quoted as saying ``there were 139 people on board, plus five
crew. There were only five survivors.'' 
<P>
The cause of the crash was not known. But officials identified
the plane as an Electra belonging to Trans Service Airlift, one
of several air charter companies operating in Zaire. No other
details were immediately available. 
<HR>

<H3>Japan Volcano </H3>

<P>
In Japan, white volcanic ash is covering the ground near Mount
Hossho. 
<P>
The volcano - on the southern island of Kyushu - has ended its
two-month silence, spewing smoke and ash about two-thousand meters
into the air. 
<P>
October's activity was the first in the Kuju range in 257 years.
There's concern over more intense activity ... and scientific
observers have been sent to the area. 
<HR>

<H3>Tuzla: NATO Arrives </H3>

<P>
NATO formally took over peacekeeping duties in Bosnia from the
United Nations today. 
<P>
NATO troops and equipment continue to pouring into the war-torn
country as alliance commanders prepare to take over formal command.

<HR>

<H3>Tobacco Clip </H3>

<P>
Canada's three cigarette companies plan to start advertising next
year. The Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council says the ads
won't appear on television or radio, nor will they target minors.

<P>
The three companies -- Imperial Tobacco, RJR Macdonald, and Rothmans
Benson and Hedges say their code complies with criteria the Supreme
Court suggested in September, when it struck down a federal ad
ban as unconstitutional. 
<HR>

<H3>Bankruptcies</H3>

<P>
Business and personal bankruptcies soared in Ontario in October
by almost 32 percent to 26-hundred 64 from one year earlier. 
<P>
For the first 10 months of the year, Ontario saw more than 23-thousand
individuals and businesses go belly up... 11.6 per cent more than
the just under 21-thousand that did so in the first 10 months
of 1994. 
<HR>

<H3>Milton No GO </H3>

<P>
January fifth is the last day for off peak go- train service to
Milton. 
<P>
Bus service from union station will be increased to partially
compensate. Only peak rail service will be provided starting January
eighth, with five trains in the morning and another five in the
evening. GO Transit blames poor ridership for the decision.

<HR>

<H3>Omnibus Hearings </H3>

<P>
Public hearings on the Ontario government's controversial omnibus
bill are now under way. 
<P>
The first day of hearings saw health minister Jim Wilson taking
the heat. 
<HR>

<H3>Tories - Police</H3>

<P>
Is the Tory government cleaning house? That's the claim of a labour
leader in Brantford who was fired from the city's police services
board. 
<P>
As Marci Ien reports, Garry Marshall is just the latest casualty
of the Tory ax. 
<P>
<I>Garry Macdonald made the comment after the throne speech in
September...and the subsequent storming of the legislature. A
riot that saw several injured in battles with police. </I>
<P>
<I>Brantford Tory MPP Ron Johnson says Macdonald's words were
inappropriate... and brought the case to Solicitor-General Bob
Runciman's attention. Macdonald says that hidden Tory agenda is
to relieve all NDP appointed police board members from their positions.
A claim that Ron Johnson denies. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Tories Tag </H3>

<P>
And another note, Garry Macdonald is not the only person with
NDP ties to be dismissed from a police board. 
<P>
Last Friday, former Ottawa mayor Marion Dewar was fired from her
job as chairwoman of the Ottawa-Carleton Police Services Board.

<HR>

<H3>Sales Tax Fraud</H3>

<P>
Sales tax evasion is soaring in Ontario. The provinces' Finance
Ministry says incidents of sales tax fraud have increased six
hundred percent in the last seven years. And, the amount of money
being scammed is up dramatically too. Average evasion was 19-thousand
dollars in 1988 ...now it's 130-thousand. 
<P>
A St. Catharines businessman, 49 year old Mohamed Munshi, is one
of the latest retailers convicted of sales tax evasion. The operator
of two &quot;Smokers Place&quot; outlets in the Niagara peninsula
has been fined 40-thousand dollars for failing to remit 98-thousand
dollars in taxes owing. Ontario collects about 9 billion dollars
a year in retail sales tax. 
<HR>

<H3>China-town Murder</H3>

<P>
Police in Toronto are continuing their investigation into a shooting
at a Chinese restaurant that left one person dead and three others
injured. 
<P>
The dead man was found outside the Jun-Jun restaurant, with an
AK 47 rifle next to him. It's not clear if he was the gunman or
if there was another shooter. It's believed some people involved
in the incident took off in cabs before police arrived. 
<HR>

<H3>Ipperwash Charges </H3>

<P>
A noisy demonstration outside a Sarnia courthouse this morning.

<P>
About two dozen natives are protesting charges laid against five
people during the occupation of Ipperwash Provincial Park last
September. The five face several weapons and assault charges.
The protesters are also angry about being left out of talks aimed
at the formal return of Camp Ipperwash to natives. 
<HR>

<H3>Storm-Blood </H3>

<P>
A recent snowstorm has caused a big drop in blood donations. That's
forced some Ontario hospitals to cancel surgery. 
<P>
Supplies at the Toronto blood centre, which supplies blood and
blood products to 61 hospitals, are at critical levels after poor
weather canceled one large clinic and lowered turnouts at others.
The centre's director says it will postpone more elective surgery
unless supplies increase. 
<HR>

<H3>Women Smoking</H3>

<P>
Despite years of warning about of the dangers of cigarettes, the
number of smoking related deaths continues to rise. Especially
among women. 
<P>
While death rates for smoking related cancers among men have stabilized
after doubling between 1950 and 1985, the rates for women has
quadrupled, and are still growing. 
<HR>

<H3>Fisheries Clip</H3>

<P>
Despite years of protest from animal rights activists, the Canadian
government has increased the hunting quota for Atlantic seals.
The quota increase is huge ... 35 per cent, and is part of a new
groundfish conservation strategy. 
<HR>

<H3>Bosnia Unload </H3>

<P>
After days of weather delays, NATO planes are landing in Tuzla.

<P>
The first US combat troops will move American troops and equipment
into Bosnia, preparing the way for NATO's 60-thousand member operation.
But as the NATO buildup continues, a sniper's bullet has caused
the first casualty in Sarajevo since the Bosnian peace plan was
signed last week. 
<P>
A 30 year old woman on a streetcar was wounded after a bullet
hit her. 
<HR>

<H3>Russian Elections</H3>

<P>
Although preliminary returns from Russia's election won't be complete
for two more days, Russia's communists seem to be holding their
lead. 
<P>
The communists have garnered 22 per cent of the vote for seats
in parliament. Canadians who observed the election say the voting
was fair and open. 
<HR>

<H3>France Resumes </H3>

<P>
Regular transit schedules have resumed in France, after a month
long strike by public employees. 
<P>
Rail workers and other public service workers voted last Friday
to end their walkout over the government's deficit cutting package.
Fares for trains, subways and buses will be free until service
is back to normal. 
<P>
With Christmas just a week away, and their savings running low,
the workers simply lost momentum. 
<HR>

<H3>US Shutdown </H3>

<P>
And while the French transit system opens up, the American government
is facing another partial shutdown ... the second in a month.

<P>
Several US tourist attractions have temporarily shut down, because
there isn't enough money to pay people to work there. 
<P>
A quarter of a million federal workers were sent home today. Both
the Republicans and Clinton administration are blaming each other
for the shutdown. But the two sides have agreed to meet, possibly
to discuss a new balanced budget proposal. 
<HR>

<H3>Diana Christmas</H3>

<P>
There'll be a little more elbow room at the table for Christmas
dinner at Buckingham palace. 
<P>
At the last minute, Diana the Princess of Wales has changed her
plans and will not spend Christmas with the royal family. It's
the first time since she separated from prince Charles three years
ago that Diana will be apart from her sons during the holidays.

<H3>Session Ender </H3>

<P>
Ontario will never be the same ... those words from Premier Mike
Harris of the province...and the opposition agrees with him. 
<P>
The first session of the Ontario legislature ended last night.
It started with a riot... and was highlighted by an all night
sit in by MPPs. 
<HR>

<H3>Last Call </H3>

<P>
And there are still many more changes to come down the pike from
the Tories. 
<P>
One under consideration now is to extend bar hours past one o'clock...
until two or three in the morning. Consumer Affairs Minister Norm
Sterling says changing drinking hours would help Ontario bars
compete with those in other provinces and the United States. 
<P>
The idea is receiving mixed reviews... positive from many bar
owners and patrons...but not so positive from the group, Mothers
Against Drunk Driving. The groups says it will lead to more carnage.

<HR>

<H3>London Doctors</H3>

<P>
Doctors in London are banding together to beat the Tory government's
omnibus bill... a new political action committee of doctors says
bill 26 gives politicians ultimate control over the medical profession.

<P>
The doctors say they'd better speak up now, before it's too late..
and the system is damaged beyond repair. 
<HR>

<H3>Doctors Going South</H3>

<P>
Bill 26 is just another reason for Ontario doctors to leave this
province and head south... and this weekend a conference will
give them the know how they need to take their skills to the United
States. 
<P>
Up to seventy doctors are expected at the conference in St. Thomas
which will teach them how to move their practices to the US. The
conference is hosted by a Toronto company that specializes in
recruiting disenchanted Canadian physicians to the US. 
<HR>

<H3>Tax Cuts </H3>

<P>
The Harris government is being advised to delay tax cuts if it
wants to meet its deficit target. 
<P>
The Dominion Bond Rating Service says it may become necessary
to cut more spending and to hold off on the promised tax cuts,
in order to trim the deficit as much as the government wants.

<P>
Harris has promised to cut personal income tax rates by 30 per
cent and to cut eight-billion dollars in spending. The bond rating
agency says no can do. But cabinet minister Dave Johnson says
the tax cuts will come regardless. 
<HR>

<H3>Bernardo Costs</H3>

<P>
The country's most expensive murder manhunt will officially shut
down by year's end. 
<P>
A skeleton crew of detectives is still cleaning up paperwork of
the Green Ribbon Task Force. But by the end of the year, just
over two weeks away now, all of the investigators will return
to their regular duties. 
<P>
The task force spent 8-million dollars to bring Paul Bernardo
to trial for their deaths ... the costliest murder manhunt in
Canadian history. 
<P>
The costs include nearly 20-thousand dollars for office furniture,
19-hundred dollars on counseling for task force members and 31-hundred
dollars for hotel rooms police used for surveillance of Bernardo's
ex-wife Karla Homolka. 
<HR>

<H3>Guard Evening </H3>

<P>
A provincial jail guard has been charged with sexually assaulting
female inmates at the Hamilton Wentworth detention centre. 
<P>
The charges come after a seven month OPP investigation. Police
say the assaults are alleged to have occurred between 1990 and
1995 and involve five women. 
<P>
33 year old Marc (ree'-al) of Welland appeared for a bail hearing
on three counts of sexual assault and five counts of breach of
trust. He has been remanded in custody until Monday when his case
will be moved to Waterloo Region.
<P>
(ree'-al) has been working as a correctional officer at the centre
since April of 1990. 
<HR>

<H3>Morgentaler - Pope</H3>

<P>
Abortion doctor Henry Morgentaler has effectively accused Pope
John Paul of inciting pro-life fanatics to commit acts of violence
against doctors who perform abortions, as well as their families.

<P>
He has written a letter to the pontiff in which he says he and
other abortion doctors have been demonized by religious conservatives.

<P>
All of this at a Toronto news conference today. Anthony Pooley
reports. 
<P>
<I>Without a doubt, it is the single most controversial and divisive
moral issue of our time, pitting pro-choice against pro-life,
with the latter's fanatical fringe occasionally resorting to violence
against those who perform abortions, exemplified by this bombing
of a clinic more than three years ago and recent gunshots fired
at physicians in Ancaster and Vancouver. </I>
<P>
<I>Abortion doctor Henry Morgentaler believes it is the strong
rhetoric surrounding religious dogma that incites fanatics to
commit these acts, while targeted physicians and their families
live in mortal fear. </I>
<P>
<I>For his own war of words, Morgentaler has targeted the single
largest religious denomination that dogmatically denounces abortion.
More than that, he suggests that the moral influence of the leader
of the Roman Catholic Church ... Pope John Paul the second ...
and the power of his anti- abortion rhetoric ... extends well
beyond the faithful.</I>
<P>
<I>In a letter to the pope, Morgentaler is seeking unequivocal
denunciation of the violence, and moderation of rhetoric. And
he has also written to the Canadian Council of Catholic Bishops,
seeking dialogue with them. No one from the church would agree
to an on-camera interview. In a written statement, the council
says that it will continue to stand up for human life both inside
and outside the womb, and to condemn all forms of violence against
human life. As for dialogue... it is unlikely. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton... Anthony Pooley... Channel 11 News.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Feds Overhaul </H3>

<P>
The federal government is working on a piece of legislation that
would give it new, far-reaching powers. 
<P>
The Ottawa Citizen newspaper says deputy ministers have been briefed
on a plan to restructure the public service. The plan would make
it easier for Ottawa to reach its goal of cutting forty five thousand
jobs. 
<HR>

<H3>Interac Bust Up</H3>

<P>
Canadian consumers may soon be able to get their money in new
ways at new places ... and they'll do it for less. 
<P>
The Competition Bureau has loosened the monopoly on the Interac
system held by banks and trust companies. 
<P>
Now, retailers and insurance companies will be able to join the
Interac electronic banking network. That could mean lower services
charges for automatic teller withdrawals and debit card purchases.

<HR>

<H3>Ethanol Plant</H3>

<P>
Good news for Ontario corn farmers and for the quality of our
air. 
<P>
Not on the list of government cuts is provincial money to build
a multi-million dollar ethanol plant in Chatham. The government
pulled the plug on the funding two months ago, but Agriculture
Minister Noble Villeneuve has come to a five million dollar financial
support agreement. The plant would manufacture ethanol from corn
.. and would supply a market for up to thirty million bushels
of Ontario corn. 
<P>
Ethanol is blended into gasoline to produce an environmentally
safer fuel for all cars. It's available at over two hundred and
fifty outlets throughout the province...and at some Sunoco stations.

<HR>

<H3>Bosnia Peace Pact </H3>

<P>
Just three minutes... that's how long it took to sign an agreement
to end nearly four years of war in the former Yugoslavia. 
<P>
It has been a war characterized by the most brutal and horrific
fighting and atrocities in Europe since the end of the second
world war... but today diplomats and world leaders called on all
sides to grasp this opportunity for peace. 
<P>
The agreement was struck in Dayton, Ohio last month and leaves
Bosnia in a divided state. Sixty thousand NATO forces will be
put on the ground to monitor the implementation of the peace pact.

<HR>

<H3>Signing Reax </H3>

<P>
It seems not everyone has read the peace pact. 
<P>
While most Bosnians were watching the signing of the peace deal...
and cautiously celebrating the end of the brutal war, shelling
started in Sarajevo. Just a hint of what the NATO troops including
Canadians will have to contend with. 
<HR>

<H3>Winter Slush </H3>

<P>
Today's morning rush hour was hell, as old man winter unloaded
everything in its arsenal upon beleaguered commuters. 
<P>
There was snow followed by sleet followed by rain... and then
fog... as Anthony Pooley reports. 
<P>
<I>What a day! It snowed overnight, then just as commuters were
set to head into work, it started to rain and suddenly, even the
best plowed roads turned to sheets of ice as highways and byways
filled to the brim with morning rush hour traffic. </I>
<P>
<I>Then as the temperature rose to above freezing, roads became
slushy as well as icy, making driving treacherous. There were
dozens of minor accidents. </I>
<P>
<I>Those lucky enough to have the day off had plenty of work cut
out for them... with portable snowblowers and shovels as the implements
of choice. </I>
<P>
<I>School busses did not run, although some school boards kept
classrooms open for those who could get there. Numerous other
community activities were canceled, and some agencies and centres
remained closed for the day. </I>
<P>
<I>And on top of everything else, this afternoon, fog became a
factor, resulting in limited visibility for ground and air traffic
alike. At Pearson International Airport, both incoming and outgoing
flights were delayed. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton... Anthony Pooley... Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Sault Roof Down </H3>

<P>
And you would be wise to double-check before you head out anywhere
tonight...a number of events have been canceled across southern
Ontario and plane delays are still possible with fog causing some
problems. 
<P>
And problems still for areas in the northern part of the province..
part of the snow-packed roof at a mall in Sault Ste. Marie came
crashing down this morning. 
<P>
Witnesses say the roof at Station Mall rumbled like thunder before
caving in -- no injuries have been reported, except for one woman
suffering from shock. 
<P>
The Soo has been hit with 175 centimetres of snow in the past
week. 
<HR>

<H3>Green Ribbon Probe </H3>

<P>
An internal report on the Green Ribbon Task Force and its work
investigating the murders of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy
will not be made public at least not for now ..Lauran Sabourin
has the details. 
<P>
<I>In a tersely worded statement the chairperson of the Niagara
Police Services Board told the media that the internal review
on the Green Ribbon Task Force investigation of the murders of
Kristen French, Leslie Mahaffy and Tammy Homolka would not be
released today. </I>
<P>
<I>The board said it didn't want to make this document public
because it will be a key part of the much larger provincial probe
into the Green Ribbon Task Force and metro Sex Assaults Squads
handling of the case against Paul Bernardo. And the second investigation
into the controversial plea deal made with Bernardo's ex wife
Karla Homolka. </I>
<P>
<I>Chairperson Melva Snowling would reveal little about the internal
report. It was chief Grant Waddell who initially and apparently
in consultation with the board lawyer who recommended that the
report which is more than 100 pages be made public. He has changed
his mind...</I>
<HR>

<H3>Justice Clips </H3>

<P>
Justice Minister Allan Rock has introduced a bill that would crack
down on stalkers and those who prey on prostitutes, especially
young ones. 
<P>
Any stalker who kills would automatically be convicted of first-degree
murder. The legislation would also make it easier for child prostitutes
to testify against their pimps. It also raises minimum jail terms
to five years for pimps who coerce those under 18 into prostitution.

<HR>

<H3>Rape Privacy </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has ruled that those accused of sexual
assault have a right to the medical records of their alleged victims...
and that includes the notes of counselors and psychologists who
have helped the victims recover. 
<P>
Women's groups say the ruling could stop victims from reporting
the crimes...for fear of the public humiliation. 
<HR>

<H3>Canton Promo </H3>

<P>
And also in Ottawa today, now that Lucien Bouchard has stepped
down as leader of the Bloc Quebecois, the Reform Party is making
its move to replace the Bloc as the official opposition and immigration
rules are being changed to target abusers of our welcome matt......
we'll have more on those stories on Canada tonight at six thirty.

<HR>

<H3>Gas Tax? </H3>

<P>
Despite what the premier says ...opposition parties at Queens
Park say that the voluminous bill 26 will allow municipalities
to levy new taxes ..including a tax on gasoline. 
<P>
Ernist Town, a township of 11 thousand people in eastern Ontario,
has asked the government for permission to level a gas tax to
pay for local road maintenance. And other municipalities believe
they should be able to do the same.. once again however the government
denies it will happen. 
<HR>

<H3>OMA-Bill 26 </H3>

<P>
The Liberals took on the cause of doctors in the house today...the
Ontario Medical Association is warning the public that the Harris
government's omnibus bill 26 will give the Minister of Health
the power to decide what medical treatment is appropriate. 
<HR>

<H3>Emergency Wilson</H3>

<P>
The province is expanding a pilot emergency medical project that
has proven effective in saving lives. 
<P>
Specially-trained ambulance attendants in Essex county, Halton
and Peel regions, Simcoe county and Muskoka carried symptom relief
medications and heart defibrillators with them over the past year.
And Health Minister Jim Wilson says at least five people's lives
were saved as a result. Wilson says the project will be expanded
to cover 90 per cent of Ontario. 
<HR>

<H3>United Church</H3>

<P>
The United Church of Canada wants governments to stop what it
calls a &quot;growing war&quot; against the poor. 
<P>
In a letter to be read during sermons at four-thousand churches
on Sunday, the church blasts political leaders who use what it
calls &quot;dangerous rhetoric&quot; to divide communities. It
says people are now being grouped according to those who have
enough income to pay taxes, and those who are sick, disabled,
unemployed or in need of education and medical care. 
<P>
A church spokeswoman says the letter doesn't single out any particular
government, but arose out of a concern that governments have been
unfairly targeting the poor. 
<P>
The church also wants January 7th designated as a day to discuss
ways to protest cuts, including a refusal to keep any tax breaks
promised by Ontario Premier Mike Harris that are funded by cutbacks.

<HR>

<H3>Agostino-Pledge</H3>

<P>
Hamilton Liberal MPP, Dominic Agostino got a Christmas wish today.
His private members' bill to add Canada to the oath of allegiance
taken by provincial members of parliament, received the all important
second reading today. 
<P>
Last spring Agostino was prevented from taking his seat in the
legislature as an MPP, because he tried to change the oath of
allegiance, to include Canada as well as the Queen. So the determined
MPP introduced a private members bill to change the oath. Today
the bill came to a vote in the legislature. 
<P>
Education Minister John Snobelen brought some extra Tories into
the house in an effort to defeat the bill ..but to no avail. It
passed second reading 36 to 16. Agostino was astounded at Snobelen's
tactics. 
<P>
Agostino's bill in all probability be come law next spring.

<H3>Plane Crash </H3>

<P>
Italian police say all 45 people on board a Romanian airliner
died today when it crashed on takeoff at Verona. 
<P>
The plane went down about one kilometre from the end of the runway,
slamming into the ground in snowy, windy weather. 
<P>
A fierce fire raged after the crash, but it's unclear yet whether
the flames broke out before or after the plane went down. 
<P>
Most of the victims are believed to have been Italians. It's not
clear where the aircraft was heading. 
<HR>

<H3>RCMP Report </H3>

<P>
Poor training and weak policies are to blame for the break-in
at the Prime Minister's residence. 
<P>
That's the bottom line of a long awaited report on the RCMP's
failure to prevent the break-in and it's slow reaction time to
the Prime Minister's call for help. An intruder armed with a knife
made it all the way to the PMs bedroom door. 
<P>
Solicitor General Herb Gray says the report is somewhat vague
for a reason. To ensure the fair trial of the man accused of attempting
to kill the PM. 
<HR>

<H3>OMA. - Omnibus </H3>

<P>
The Ontario Ministry of Health is about to be deluged by thousands
of faxes from disgruntled physicians, seeking prior approval for
even the simplest medical procedures. 
<P>
It's part of a planned protest against new, sweeping government
powers over just about every aspect of a physician's practice,
called for in the notorious Omnibus bill 26, expected to become
Ontario law early next year. 
<P>
Anthony Pooley reports. 
<P>
<I>Is the day finally here when government bureaucrats and politicians
are looking over the shoulders of every physician, second guessing
what they do and how they do it? Ontario's doctors believe that's
what will happen if bill 26 passes without revision. That's the
notorious omnibus bill that touches just about every aspect of
the lives of Ontarians. </I>
<P>
<I>Doctors throughout Ontario gathered in various venues today
to listen to the president of their association via satellite
hook-up. The OMA says that bill 26 would: -erode patient confidentiality
through the publication of medical records; -scrap partnership
agreements between doctors and the government; -result in a complete
government take-over of medical care, including the empowerment
of bureaucrats to contradict medical decisions; -strip doctors
of hospital privileges without the right to appeal; -and forbid
doctors from practicing in certain regions of the province. </I>
<P>
<I>Physicians will also be asking their patients to sign petitions
and mail in post cards opposing the bill 26 measures. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton... Anthony Pooley... Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Hospital Charges </H3>

<P>
Also under the omnibus bill, thousands of hospital patients would
be forced to pay room and board. 
<P>
Any patient waiting for a place in a nursing home or a chronic
care hospital would be charged nearly twenty seven dollars a day,
to stay in the hospital. Right now those charges are picked up
by OHIP. 
<P>
Up to five thousand people could be effected by the charge. That's
how many people on any given day are in hospital waiting for other
care. 
<HR>

<H3>Child Care </H3>

<P>
Ontario Social Services Minister David Tsubouchi says he doesn't
know whether or not he'll cash in on Ottawa's new day care offer...
Human Resources Minister Lloyd Axworthy is offering the provinces
and aboriginal groups 720-million dollars for child care over
the next three to five years. 
<P>
The provinces would have to match the federal cash dollar for
dollar to qualify. 
<HR>

<H3>Child Reax.</H3>

<P>
The Ontario Coalition for Better Childcare says it is &quot;somewhat&quot;
pleased with Ottawa's plans for more daycare spaces, but mostly
confused. Coalition President Kerry McCuaig says the plan is &quot;vague&quot;.

<P>
There is concern over the government not calling the plan a national
child care program. And they are worried about the regulation
of day care. 
<HR>

<H3>Finance Meet </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, in Ottawa, the country's finance ministers are talking
about tinkering with your pension... specifically, the possibility
of raising the qualifying age for the Canadian pension plan from
65 to 67. 
<P>
However the ministers have agree that that would only be as a
last resort. 
<HR>

<H3>Legal Aid Deal</H3>

<P>
The Ontario government and the law society have come to an agreement
which will see the backlog of legal aid bills paid. 
<P>
But the announcement made by Attorney General Charles Harnick,
does not sit well with a good portion of the legal profession,
and may present problems for the poor and illegal immigrants.

<HR>

<H3>Harris-Head Tax</H3>

<P>
More assurances from the Tories that their jumbo bill will not
allow municipalities to charge a head tax or impose new sales
or incomes taxes. 
<P>
Premier Mike Harris says there is no way his government will it.
Harris says through the omnibus bill, local governments will be
able to charge user fees ..but no new taxes. 
<P>
Municipal Affairs Minister Al Leach said yesterday, that if the
bill gave the right to municipalities to levy a head tax, he would
resign. 
<HR>

<H3>Cheap Lunches </H3>

<P>
And there will be no such thing as a cheap lunch at Queen's Park
anymore. 
<P>
MPPs meals at the Queen's Park dining room will no longer be subsidized.
That decision from the legislature's board of internal economy.

<P>
The subsidies had been eating a three million dollar deficit into
the legislature's food services group for the last three years.

<HR>

<H3>Cochran Speaks </H3>

<P>
The OJ. Simpson tour of lawyers continued today ... yesterday
it was prosecutor Marcia Clark ...today it's lead defence lawyer
for Simpson, Johnny Cochran. 
<P>
Flanked by body guards, Simpson's lead defence lawyer told a news
conference in Toronto today that many of the racial issues raised
by the Simpson trial are relevant to Canada because systemic racism
exists in every society. 
<P>
He insists he is not trying to profit from the killings that led
to the OJ Simpson trial. However, unlike Marcia Clark, Cochran
was willing to comment on the trial. Cochran is to speak to a
full house tonight in Toronto. 
<HR>

<H3>Durham Fire Deaths</H3>

<P>
Two bodies -- believed to be those of a mother and daughter --
have been found in the burned remains of a farmhouse near Toronto.

<P>
The house near Mosport burned yesterday... and today police are
trying to determine for certain who the victims are... they believe
they are a 56-year-old woman and her 17-year-old daughter. But
investigators say dental records will have to be used... no word
on the cause of the blaze yet. 
<HR>

<H3>Brain Surgery </H3>

<P>
Canada's first endoscopic brain surgery was performed at St. Michael's
hospital in Toronto and today the patient is going home. 
<P>
Last week, doctors removed a portion of an extensive pituitary
tumor from the base of the patient's brain. The instruments were
inserted through the nose. 
<P>
Doctors say the advantages to this kind of surgery include less
scarring, a faster recovery period, decreased medical costs, and
potentially fewer complications. 
<HR>

<H3>Winter Storm</H3>

<P>
Southern Ontario is in for a whallop of winter... a winter storm
watch has been issued for a region extending from Windsor east
to the Toronto area, and as far north as Muskoka. 
<P>
Several areas already hit by blinding snowsqualls... environment
Canada says the messy weather will include up to fifteen centimetres
of snow... and then freezing rain.

<H3>Roof Collapse </H3>

<P>
The massive snowfall across the province is taking its toll again
today... the roof of the Midland Mirror Newspaper offices collapsed
under the weight of the heavy snow. 
<P>
One employee was trapped when tons of snow and debris crashed
into the building. Christine Roberts was pulled out of the rubble
by rescuers and taken to hospital. But she is reported to be just
fine after her ordeal. 
<HR>

<H3>Bad Weather</H3>

<P>
Schools and highways were closed again today in some parts of
the province menaced still by snowsqualls... snowfall records
were still being smashed as more snow fell overnight and today
in the Barrie-Orillia area... the snowbanks just keep getting
bigger and bigger. ... and snowsqualls from lake Huron and Georgian
Bay continued to paralyze areas from Goderich to Owen Sound. 
<P>
To give you an idea of just how much snow has come down, Environment
Canada says the Orillia area normally receives 280 centimetres
of snow each winter, but more than that has already fallen, about
295 centimetres here are the figures for the past few days alone...
80 centimetres of snow fell on Fort Erie on Sunday -- that doubles
the previous one-day December record set in 1977. 
<P>
106 centimetres fell on the Owen Sound area over the past three
days. 
<P>
And 140 centimetres, that is nearly five feet, landed on Sault
Ste. Marie since this past weekend. 
<P>
In Michigan, the storm was blamed for at least five deaths...
as blizzards and unseasonably cold weather froze schools, and
businesses and left motorists stranded on highways...or for the
lucky ones ...at service stations and motels. 
<P>
And yes, more snow.. and more cold is on its way.. another ten
centimetres is due Thursday and this frigid air is around for
a bit too.
<HR>

<H3>Animal Charges </H3>

<P>
With the frigid weather comes a stern reminder not to leave your
animals outside in this cold... not only could the animals suffer
serious injury and even death...but you can be charged with neglect
as well.
<HR>

<H3>MPP Compensation</H3>

<P>
Provincial politicians started running for cover today in the
wake of a government commissioned report which advocated giving
MPPs 110 thousand dollars a year in salary. Premier Mike Harris
quickly said he would veto the proposal. 
<HR>

<H3>Curling Banished</H3>

<P>
And the man who led the charge against bill 26 has been kicked
out of the legislature.
<P>
Liberal MPP Alvin Curling staged an 18-hour sit-in at the Ontario
legislature to protest the jumbo bill. 
<P>
Speaker Al McLean has barred Curling from the house until next
spring. 
<P>
However government house leader Ernie Eves has said he is willing
to meet with the opposition parties to see if a compromise can
be worked out. 
<P>
Curling's protest began around four o'clock in the afternoon last
Wednesday, when the opposition parties protested the Tory government's
plans to pass the bill by Christmas. he declined to vote on a
routine motion and refused to leave his seat when the sergeant-at-arms
tried to have him removed. 
<HR>

<H3>Kicked Out of School </H3>

<P>
There'll be no more school for two boys who caused fifty thousand
dollars worth of damage at a Hamilton public school last month.

<P>
The boys, aged 10 and 11, broke windows, smashed computers, threw
paint and emptied fire extinguishers at Westview Middle school.
Citing it as a very serious case of vandalism the board of trustees
with the Hamilton Board of Education expelled the two boys. 
<P>
Cheryl Macpherson says what her son did was wrong, but so is the
board's decision. Some might say the punishment is too harsh,
but according to the Hamilton Board of Education it is based on
Ministry guidelines and broad-based community support. 
<P>
The parents may apply to have their children re-instated in six
months. 
<HR>

<H3>Marcia Clark </H3>

<P>
OJ Simpson prosecutor Marcia Clark spoke out against domestic
violence for the first time since the double murder trial ended.

<P>
She told an audience at Roy Thompson Hall last night that society
has to treat spousal abuse seriously because it is a crime...
and she urged people not to turn a blind eye if they witness domestic
violence but to get involved. 
<P>
Clark also spoke to reporters but did not discuss the famous trial
of the former footballer.
<HR>

<H3>AIDS Drug</H3>

<P>
A new drug that has shown remarkable results on AIDS patients
has been approved for sale in Canada. 
<P>
The drug was developed in Canada and received US approval a few
weeks ago. 
<P>
As Dwight Ryan explains, some scientists believe &quot;3-t-c&quot;
is the greatest Canadian contribution to medical science since
insulin. 
<P>
<I>Scientists are quick to say that the drug 3TC is not a cure
for </I>AIDS<I>. But combined with AZT, the most commonly used
anti-HIV drug, 3TC is showing remarkable results. </I>
<P>
<I>Discovered and developed in Canada, 3TC was this week approved
for sale by Canada's health protection branch. </I>
<P>
<I>Scientists at Montreal's Biochem Pharma discovered the drug
six years ago. The rights were sold to the British based pharmaceutical
company Glaxo Wellcome who then conducted further testing in Mississauga
and brought it to the market. </I>
<P>
<I>Unlike some drugs, HIV patients have few side effects from
taking 3TC along with AZT. And the amount of </I>AIDS<I> virus
in the blood is often reduced by as much as 90 percent. </I>AIDS<I>
patients and activists are understandably excited about the government
approval given to 3TC. But for many, the discovery comes to late.

<H3>Mill Fire </H3>

<P>
A massive blaze at a mill in Methuen Massachussetts injured at
least two dozen people, many of them critically.
<P>
Firefighters have been working on the blaze all night and day...
at the peak the texture factory complex was completely engulfed,
sending flames as high as a hundred and fifty feet into the frigid
night sky. 
<P>
More than a hundred firefighters from thirty communities were
brought in to battle the tremendous fire. 
<P>
Malden Mills is the largest employer in the town about twenty
five miles north of Boston.

<H3>Ontario Deep Freeze </H3>

<P>
It was an awesome sight... four feet of snow reported in parts
of Ontario and the US... and it happened fast ...very fast.
<P>
A series of vicious storms paralyzed large areas... and as the
snowbanks rose, the temperatures tumbled. 
<P>
As Lauran Sabourin reports it is all going into the record books.

<P>
<I>Ontario's cottage country was buried under four feet of snow
this weekend. Blinding snow that stranded unprepared motorists
in three foot drifts. </I>
<P>
<I>Conditions so treacherous the major highways including highways
69 and 169 were closed. Snowmobiles and four wheel drive vehicles
were the only way to get around. </I>
<P>
<I>Although snow squalls were forecast for the area the storm
still left many people asking where this storm came from. </I>
<P>
<I>Snow drifts are what people in the southern end of Niagara
and buffalo are digging out of this morning. Forty inches of snow
off of lake Erie were dumped on the region. The heaviest 24 hour
snowfall on record. </I>
<P>
<I>A state of emergency was declared in the city. The national
guard was called out to help clear clogged streets. Streets so
impassable that vehicles were ordered off the roads. </I>
<P>
<I>The area where the snow was being dumped looked like a barren
arctic wasteland. So much snow that people are comparing this
storm to the blizzard of 77. </I>
<P>
<I>Areas of the province that escaped the snow will still remember
this weather system. Over the weekend record low temperatures
were recorded at the Hamilton weather office. Another record breaking
night is expected this evening.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Deep Freeze Tag </H3>

<P>
The following highways in central Ontario remain closed: 
<P>
highway 11 Orillia to Barrie; highway 400 Barrie to highway 89;
highway 26 from Staynor to the junction of 26 and 27; highway
21 Owen sound to north of Goderich and highway 10 Owen sound to
Hepworth. 
<P>
In southwestern Ontario snow and wind has closed several highways,
including highway 8 from Clinton to Goderich; and highway 4 from
Clinton to Blyth.
<HR>

<H3>London Protest</H3>

<P>
It wasn't the weather that shut down the city of London...but
the first of what the unions say will be a series of strikes to
protest government cuts ...thousands of people marched through
the city ...with an aim to shut down London. 
<P>
NDP leader Bob Rae says today's shutdown of London should act
as a wake-up call for the Harris government. A call for the Tories
to slow down their irresponsible right-wing agenda. 
<HR>

<H3>Marleau Smoking </H3>

<P>
The federal government wants a complete ban on tobacco advertising.

<P>
Health Minister Diane Marleau released a blueprint today that
would prohibit tobacco ads, restrict other promotions such as
endorsements by celebrities and would clamp down on cigarette
sales to minors. It would also penalize arts and sports groups
by cutting funding to groups that receive money from tobacco companies.

<P>
Marleau's proposed measures are stronger than those contained
in the tobacco products control act, which was gutted by the Supreme
Court of Canada in a September ruling. 
<HR>

<H3>Holiday Booze </H3>

<P>
For the first time in Ontario, beer and liquor stores will be
open on a Sunday. 
<P>
Stores, employees and the government have all agreed to keep booze
outlets open on Christmas Eve from 11 a-m to 6 p-m. 
<P>
Brewers of Ontario vice president C.J. Healey says it wasn't difficult
to get government approval for the trial Sunday opening. He says
he expects sales to be brisk and store employees have welcomed
the extra day of sales. 
<P>
All beer stores in the province will remain open on December 24th,
and most liquor stores. 
<HR>

<H3>Work Women</H3>

<P>
There's no getting away from, women do more work than men... end
of story. 
<P>
The latest stats can survey showed that women at every stage of
their lives did more unpaid work than men, that means housework
and child care. And men enjoy on average a full hour more of leisure
time a day than women. 
<HR>

<H3>Loomis Update </H3>

<P>
A man remains in hospital under police guard tonight, after a
Shootout between Loomis guards and three masked men. 
<P>
It happened at the Cloverdale Mall last night. The Loomis guards
were delivering cash to a bank in the mall, when they were fired
at by the three. The guards returned fire and hit one in the neck.

<P>
None of the guards was hurt and no money was taken. The suspects
fled... and police made one arrest after a man staggered into
a hospital with a gun shot wound in the neck. 
<HR>

<H3>Homicide Child</H3>

<P>
A 31-year-old Toronto woman is charged with second-degree murder
in the beating death of her four-year-old daughter. 
<P>
Rosina Boateng was charged even before an autopsy into the death
of her daughter, Afua, was completed. 
<P>
Metro Toronto police found the child's body Saturday afternoon
in the family's Etobicoke apartment. Police say she died from
a severe beating. 
<HR>

<H3>Sinkhole </H3>

<P>
And from San Francisco, something that sounds like a bad science
fiction movie... a monster sinkhole swallowed a monster home in
a chi-chi neighbourhood called Sea Cliff. 
<P>
Bit by bit, the house slipped into the widening crater, until
it suddenly caved in. Eleven other homes have been evacuated and
trees and cars are precariously leaning at steep angles. 
<P>
The sinkhole is about sixty feet deep, two hundred feet wide,
and one hundred and fifty feet long. 
<P>
Workers say the collapse started when a sewer line broke. And
the combined sewer and rain water weakened foundations in the
area. Weather related flooding and power outages are hampering
efforts to contain the damage.

<HR>

<H3>Municipal User Fees</H3>

<P>
At least a couple of mayors think the idea of users fees for services
is a good idea... the province's controversial omnibus bill would
give municipalities new powers to tax residents and sell city
run services. 
<P>
Both North York Mayor Mel Lastman and Mississauga Mayor Hazel
McCallion make no apologies for being behind user fees. Lastman
says he would charge to use skating rinks, swimming pools, some
city hall services and false fire alarms. Hazel McCallion also
favours fees for false fire and police alarms and use of the library.

<HR>

<H3>Bill 26 Mock Hearing </H3>

<P>
Even though the government has agreed to public hearings on its
all encompassing omnibus bill, the NDP caucus today started its
own consultations with the public on the jumbo bill. 
<HR>

<H3>December 11th Promo </H3>

<P>
It'll be a taste of Paris in London on Monday ... that's Paris
France and London Ontario... that's when unions are threatening
to shut down the city to protest the Tory government's deep spending
cuts. We'll have full coverage from London on Monday. 
<HR>

<H3>Police-Runciman</H3>

<P>
There could be fewer police chiefs across Ontario once a government
review of police structure and financing is complete. 
<P>
Solicitor General Bob Runciman says he wants to see if police
services can be restructured to add more front-line officers and
cut administration costs. Runciman plans to announce the review
in the legislature next week. 
<HR>

<H3>Hunter re: Bernardo</H3>

<P>
A group of citizens is concerned that the inquiry into the Karla
Homolka plea deal is being kept secret. The group leaders, who
also spearheaded a 300-thousand name petition against the deal,
held a news conference at Queen's Park this afternoon. 
<P>
They have a number of specific questions they want answered. The
questions include whether new charges will be laid against Homolka.
 They want to know if copies of the sexually explicit videotapes
are circulating in Florida. And was the plea bargain politically
motivated? 
<HR>

<H3>Bernardo House</H3>

<P>
It cost Ontario taxpayers $95,000 to buy the now-demolished house
where Paul Bernardo tortured and killed teenagers Kristen French
and Leslie Mahaffy. 
<P>
The house was reduced to a pile of rubble Tuesday and hauled to
an undisclosed site to be buried. Owners Brian Delaney and Rachel
Adams still retain title to the land. The payment covered only
the house rented to Bernardo and his former wife, Karla Homolka.

<HR>

<H3>CBC Cuts </H3>

<P>
The CBC cuts have begun. More than six hundred jobs disappeared
yesterday as three hundred and twenty seven pink slips went out..
and three hundred and twelve jobs were eliminated through voluntary
resignation, early retirements and not filling vacancies. 
<P>
The job cuts are the first in an attempt to trim two hundred and
twenty seven million dollars in government funding... next fiscal
year should see another one thousand jobs go. 
<HR>

<H3>Tree Shortage </H3>

<P>
Word from Ontario's Christmas tree growers is, if you're waiting
to buy your tree until prices drop, forget it. 
<P>
Bad weather in the north means the next shipment of trees may
not come at all, and there could be a shortage. Still you can
go and cut your own as Dwight Ryan reports. 
<P>
<I>Many of the Christmas trees that we buy here in southern Ontario
are grown way up north. And despite the lack of snow here, there's
plenty in the north. So much in fact that a mid season shipment
of trees may not arrive. </I>
<P>
<I>Hubert will harvests and sells Christmas trees at his Lynden
Ontario farm. He also heads up the Christmas Tree Growers Association
of Ontario. </I>
<P>
<I>Wills says if there's no let up in the weather up north, many
consumers may find themselves out of luck. And so more and more
people may be going to rural tree farms. and when you take it
home, remember to look after it. </I>
<HR>

<H3>AIDS Pennies </H3>

<P>
A St. Catharines woman is raising money for AIDS research, one
penny at a time. 
<P>
Thirty seven year old Katrina Rice is asking Niagara area students
to bring a penny to school next Valentine's Day so they can be
deposited into a special bank account. 
<P>
Rice hopes that the campaign can be expanded across the country...
she asked <I>Tonight Show </I>host Jay Leno to support the campaign
and he sent her the first penny. 
<HR>

<H3>Final Red Rocket </H3>

<P>
It was the last day for the old TTC red rocket ... the original
street cars have been in use for more than fifty years on the
streets of Toronto. 
<P>
The car was given a police escort and was decked out in ribbons
for its final ride. TTC supervisors were pleased with all the
fuss for the nostalgic trip, but wished the police cruiser would
have picked up the pace so their schedules could be met. 
<P>
Two of the old cars will be restored and kept for posterity. 
<HR>

<H3>Doggie Show</H3>

<P>
And Toronto went to the dogs today as the Seventeenth Annual Credit
Valley Dog Show gets underway at SkyDome... this weekend thousands
of top dogs from around the world will vie for championships,
titles, top dog glory in both obedience and confirmation square
offs. 
<P>
It is one of the largest dog shows in north America... proceeds
from the three day event will be donated to the Lions' Foundation
of Canada for their canine vision school in Oakville... 
<HR>

<H3>Bosnia Aid</H3>

<P>
Turning officials from Canada and 49 other countries, as well
as international organizations are in London, trying to find a
way to build a lasting peace in Bosnia. 
<P>
The delegates include Foreign Minister Andr&eacute; Ouellet. They
will try to create a climate of stability, setting up new political
and constitutional arrangements and a &quot;free-market&quot;
economy and kick-starting economic reconstruction. 
<P>
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher speaking at the conference
said that the NATO mission in Bosnia is historic because it brings
together for the first time several European armies working side
by side ...and the only enemy in Europe now, is war itself. 
<P>
Next week, the US Senate will vote on whether or not to support
sending twenty thousand Americans to join the NATO force, but
the outcome is irrelevant, the mission will go ahead. And preparations
are well underway and so is the jockeying for position. 
<HR>

<H3>France Strikes </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile talks are scheduled between trade unions and the Conservative
government in France to settle the three week old strikes that
have crippled the country. 
<P>
The talks will be have a mediator and a compromise on plans to
cut pensions, welfare and education funding will be sought. 
<P>
There was some violence again today as public transport and trains
came to a standstill for the fifteenth day in a row.

<HR>

<H3>Campbell Bernardo </H3>

<P>
The Ontario government has appointed a senior judge to probe the
police investigation of the Paul Bernardo murder case. 
<P>
Solicitor General Bob Runciman says &quot;various aspects of the
investigation&quot; that led to murder charges against Bernardo
will be reviewed. Justice Archie Campbell of the Regional General
Division Court in Toronto will begin his work by reviewing a report
on the Green Ribbon Task Force investigation into the murders
of Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French. That report is being prepared
by the Niagara Regional Police. 
<P>
Campbell will also look at a report on the so-called Scarborough
rapist investigation being prepared by Metro Toronto police. Runciman
says the circumstances surrounding Tammy Homolka's death and autopsies
performed on her will also be reviewed. 
<P>
Campbell is to report back to the Solicitor General by march 31st
with recommendations. Runciman says Campbell's report will be
made public, provided it protects people's privacy and there are
no legal proceedings under way. 
<HR>

<H3>Legislature Protest </H3>

<P>
An all night sit-in, led to negotiations... and now they've got
a deal. 
<P>
The stalemate was broken at Queens Park today as opposition parties
reached agreement with the government over its jumbo cost cutting
bill. The agreement came after an all night sit-in by MPPs in
the legislature . 
<HR>

<H3>Wilson Gives </H3>

<P>
Prior to the deal being struck Ontario's Health Minister backed
down from a proposal that would have given him sweeping new powers
to inspect and disclose the personal health records of private
citizens. 
<P>
Jim Wilson said he would amend the omnibus bill to satisfy the
concerns of Ontario information and Privacy Commissioner Tom Wright.

<P>
Meanwhile, the Ontario Medical Association is warning the Tories,
that its omnibus bill will cause an exodus of doctors from this
province. 
<P>
The OMA says, quote, unprecedented, almost unlimited, control
over the delivery of medical services is handed over to the government
in the bill. And word that the government will pull out of the
doctors malpractice insurance program will especially effect doctors
who deliver babies or staff small town emergency rooms, or those
who perform high risk procedures.
<HR>

<H3>Rural Doctors </H3>

<P>
And rural doctors are unimpressed by the government's decision
to pay them seventy dollars an hour to work nights and weekends
in the emergency wards. 
<P>
The money was to act as an incentive to doctors so rural areas
would be ensured emergency service. 
<P>
The Society of Rural Physicians says seventy bucks isn't enough.
Rural doctors serve about three-thousand patients on average,
compared with less than one-thousand for city physicians. 
<HR>

<H3>Past Protests </H3>

<P>
The method used to gain today's deal... involved violating the
rules of order, and it is a new opposition stall tactic. But Ontario's
legislators are certainly no strangers to bogging down the business
of government. 
<P>
As Anthony Pooley reports tonight ... the current Premier adroitly
used the good, old fashioned filibuster when he sat on the other
side. 
<P>
<I>Whether through filibustering or this latest method, part of
the politics of the opposition side of the legislature is to throw
obstacles in the path of government measures that members opposite
feel are moving things too far too fast. </I>
<P>
<I>Even so, disobedience to the rules of order as a tactic is
rare, if not unprecedented. But then, so is the kind of omnibus
legislation that is being attacked. </I>
<P>
<I>Premier Mike Harris himself is remembered for his own brand
of filibustering when he sat opposite government benches. The
issue then... as it is now... government spending. </I>
<P>
<I>And Liberal MPP Sean Conway, who was right smack dab in the
middle of the current round of stalling, once lamented the extent
to which the opposition could delay government business. Of course,
Conway was House Leader for Premier David Peterson at the time.
The issue ... Sunday shopping. </I>
<P>
<I>And let's not forget the one man filibuster of Welland- Thorold
MPP Peter Kormos against liberal auto insurance measures.</I>
<P>
<I>Anthony Pooley ... Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Welfare Tomorrow </H3>

<P>
Social Services Minister David Tsubouchi missed all the excitement
in the house.. but he had some of his own, in Kitchener at a conference
on welfare... protesters smacked his car with placards and yelled
at the minister as he arrived. 
<P>
They are calling the Tory government's changes to the welfare
system, Workfare. Inside the conference, there were delegates
from all across north America tackling the problems of welfare...
the meeting was not interrupted by the protesters ...but there
was a police officer on every door. 
<HR>

<H3>Truck Inspections </H3>

<P>
The safest trucking companies in Ontario are about to get a break.

<P>
A pilot project launched by the province today will reward companies
with excellent safety records. Their trucks will not be forced
to stop at every weigh scale they pass. 
<P>
Transport trucks are now required by law to pull into inspection
stations whenever weigh scales are open. But OPP officers say
the publicity surrounding truck safety problems, increased inspections
and a coroner's inquest into truck related deaths doesn't seem
to have made much difference. 
<HR>

<H3>Chlorine Water </H3>

<P>
One of Ontario's top water experts says a study linking chlorine-treated
water to bladder and colon cancer must be followed up to determine
where the problems are. 
<P>
Goff Jenkins of the Environment Ministry say hundreds of potential
derivatives from the chlorination process need to be studied before
changes are made to the water-treatment system. 
<P>
A study has suggested 10 to 13 per cent of bladder and colon cancer
cases in Ontario may be caused by decades of drinking and bathing
in chlorine-treated water. 
<P>
Many towns and cities use chlorine to reduce harmful bacteria
and viruses in drinking water supplies. 
<HR>

<H3>Davies Funeral </H3>

<P>
Funeral services were held today for Canadian literary giant Robertson
Davies. 
<P>
About 500 family members, friends, and fans attended the simple,
half-hour ceremony at trinity college chapel in the University
of Toronto. 
<P>
Davies died of a stroke last Saturday at the age of 82. His remains
are to be cremated and his ashes scattered near his home in Caledon,
Ontario. 
<P>
A public celebration at 7:30 tomorrow night at Convocation Hall
at U of T. 
<P>
Margaret Atwood, Timothy Findley, John Kenneth Galbraith and Globe
Arts Critic Robert Fulford are among those who will speak. 
<HR>

<H3>Bosnia Canada</H3>

<P>
Ottawa is asking for more talks with NATO to decide how Canadian
troops will be used in Bosnia. 
<P>
Canada has offered to send up to one-thousand soldiers, which
could include a combat battalion and a headquarters group. They'll
likely come from CFB Petawawa, Ontario. But the federal government
is asking for more say over how the soldiers will be deployed.

<HR>

<H3>Paris Paralyzed </H3>

<P>
Teachers have now joined a massive public workers' strike in France.

<P>
In Paris, nearly 70 per cent of teachers walked out to protest
government plans to overhaul French social security. And thousands
more marched in other parts of the country. And striking workers
shut down Orly airport in Paris for an hour. 
<P>
Demonstrators marched on the runways until they were removed by
police. 
<P>
Public transportation workers have been on strike for two weeks,
paralyzing traffic the dispute also has affected mail delivery,
hospitals and schools. 
<HR>

well.

<HR>

<H3>Legis-Standoff </H3>

<P>
A Mexican standoff in the Ontario legislature! 
<P>
Opposition MPP's have refused to leave the chamber after refusing
to vote on the controversial omnibus bill. Some are calling it
a war zone. 
<HR>

<H3>Women's Demo </H3>

<P>
A demonstration in Toronto to mark the sixth anniversary of the
Montreal massacre quickly turned into a protest against Harris
government cutbacks. 
<P>
100 chanting women blocked part of a downtown intersection during
the morning rush hour. 22 were arrested and charged with mischief.

<P>
Activist Linda Torney says the economic havoc wreaked by Harris
and his corporate buddies is a form of violence against women.

<HR>

<H3>Lap Dance Reversal </H3>

<P>
An unusual twist to a familiar story. Welland city council has
changed its mind about lap dancing. 
<P>
Just two weeks ago, council voted to ban dirty dancing after hearing
a presentation from anti-lapper Katharine Goldberg. But a lawyer
for strip bar Roman's Babies told councilors that business at
Welland's only club has dropped about thirty-five percent. 
<P>
After re-considering, council reversed its decision. 
<HR>

<H3>McKnight Follow </H3>

<P>
And while violence against women is abhorrent; how much worse
is the case of those who profit from such violence? CAVEAT has
taken aim against convicted Hamilton killer, Dr. Robert McKnight;
and the hefty insurance policy ... that is paying him 60-thousand
dollars a year. Scot Urquhart has that story: 
<P>
<I>As Dr. Robert McKnight sits in Warkworth Prison, collecting
five thousand dollars a month in disability payments ... victim's
groups are reacting with horror.</I>
<P>
<I>CAVEAT founder Priscilla Devilliers says McKnight is not only
profiting from his crime, but taking taxpayers for a ride, as
we pay 81-thousand dollars a year for each inmate kept in a federal
prison. </I>
<P>
<I>She says the criminals themselves should be paying user fees.</I>
<P>
<I>But Devilliers admits, there is not much that CAVEAT can do
about the McKnight situation; she says it's up to the court of
public opinion ... the policy holders of Sun Life Trust; and the
doctors who are paying stiff insurance premiums, to provide Bob
McKnight with 60-thousand dollars a year.  And Devilliers sees
the McKnight case, as just another example of Canada's soft handling;
of hard criminals. </I>
<P>
<I>In Burlington, Scot Urquhart Channel Eleven New.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Bernardo-Water </H3>

<P>
And inmate Paul Bernardo got an unexpected shower today at Kingston
penitentiary. 
<P>
Another inmate tossed mop water through a slot in Bernardo's Plexiglas
cell front. The slot is used to pass food through to Canada's
most famous prisoner. 
<P>
Apparently the two prisoners were arguing before the water was
tossed. 
<HR>

<H3>OJ to Speak </H3>

<P>
It appears CNN is about to win the OJ interview sweepstakes. 
<P>
OJ Simpson says he'll give Ted Turners' all news network his first
unrestricted interview since the murder trial. Network Legal Analyst
Greta van Susteren says Simpson insisted there be no ground rules
for the interview. 
<P>
No date has yet been set for the CNN interview. 
<P>
Simpson was acquitted of killing his ex-wife Nicole and her friend
Ronald Goldman. He faces a civil suit by their families in April.

<HR>

<H3>Bus Crash</H3>

<P>
Two children are dead and two are badly injured in a collision
between a school bus and a trash truck in Los Angeles. 
<P>
Authorities say the truck sideswiped the bus carrying 48 children
this morning. A fire department spokesman says one of the injured
children is in critical condition and the other is serious. Most
injuries to the other 44 children were minor. 
<HR>

<H3>Welfare Rebates </H3>

<P>
Thousands of welfare recipients will get a rebate this month,
to make good on a campaign promise made by Premier Mike Harris.

<P>
The rebate is connected to a promise to allow welfare recipients
to get a job and earn back part of the money lost after the government
cut social assistance rates by 22-per-cent. 
<P>
Social Services Minister David Tsubouchi told the legislature
today the adjustments will be retroactive to October first. The
Social Services Minister says he hopes the rebate cheques will
be in the hands of welfare recipients before Christmas. 
<HR>

<H3>Canada-Bosnia </H3>

<P>
The question about what Canada's contribution to the NATO force
being sent to Bosnia has been answered. 
<P>
Just moments ago Defence Minister David Collenette announced that
Canada will send one thousand troops to Bosnia, with deployment
to begin almost immediately. 
<HR>

<H3>Bosnia Troops </H3>

<P>
In the meantime, a military base in northern Bosnia- Herzegovina
welcomed its first airplane in more than 18 months today. The
passengers will prepare the base for many more flights. 
<HR>

<H3>France Strike </H3>

<P>
In France, the biggest strike in nearly a decade is about to get
bigger. 
<P>
Already there's no mail, buses or trains. and now the strike is
about to spread from the ground to the skies. 
<HR>

<H3>Japan Arrest</H3>

<P>
South Korea isn't the only Asian nation putting some of its biggest
politicians behind bars. An anti-corruption campaign in Japan
has nailed its newest target, a former labour minister in the
middle of a twenty-seven million dollar loan scandal. 
<P>

<H3>Bernardo Evng</H3>

<P>
The house where Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka committed their
heinous acts of rape and murder, came down in a cloud of dust
this morning. 
<P>
A volunteer demolition team ripped into the building and had it
reduced to a pile of rubble within an hour. A convoy of dump trucks
carried the debris to a nearby landfill where it was buried under
ten feet of dirt, to dissuade would-be souvenir hunters. 
<P>
The Green Ribbon Task Force has wanted to destroy the house since
1993, and the neighbours have been waiting for months to see the
macabre tourist attraction leveled. 
<P>
Among the many who gathered to watch the destruction was Leslie
Mahaffy's mother, Debbie. Kristen French's niece Talon waited
until the demolition was complete so she could put flowers on
the site where Kristen and Leslie were murdered. 
<P>
Another house will likely be built one day, but the address will
be changed ...so there will never again be a &quot;57 Bayview&quot;
in Port Dalhousie. 
<HR>

<H3>McKnight-Money </H3>

<P>
At the moment there is no federal law to prevent criminals from
profiting from their crimes ... but many people say, there should
be. And some are pointing to the case of a convicted killer from
Hamilton; to prove their point. Scot Urquhart has that story:

<P>
<I>January, 1994. McMaster University professor Janet McKnight,
is murdered in her home. Her husband, doctor Robert McKnight;
is arrested at the scene; and eventually convicted of her murder.
He is sentenced to life in prison, with no chance of parole for
17 years. Lawyers have filed an appeal for that term of eligibility;
but they will not appeal the conviction. </I>
<P>
<I>Bob McKnight is now serving his sentence in Warkworth Penitentiary.
But every month as Bob McKnight counts the days ... he may also
be counting the balance in his bank account ... because Bob McKnight
... convicted murderer, receives five thousand dollars a month
in disability payments, through a group insurance policy provided
by the OMA, and Sun Life. </I>
<P>
<I>Joyce Lindsay is Janet McKnight's sister. She believes the
disability payments, are outrageous, and she wants them stopped.
Lindsay questions the validity of the claim; filed on the basis
of depression. There is also some question as to the timing; doctor
McKnight was arrested in January 1994 ... the claim was filed
a month later; while he was in custody.</I>
<P>
<I>The OMA ... will also say nothing; citing confidentiality.
There are rumours, that Sun Life is moving to cut off the payments
... and in fact, may have done so already. But if they have; no
one has told Bob McKnight. From his prison cell in Warkworth Tuesday
morning; McKnight confirmed that to the best of his knowledge,
he is still receiving five thousand dollars a month; and to those
who suggest that he is profiting from crime: &quot;I can see their
point of view. It's nice to receive the money. I am in debt ...
to my lawyers for example ... that money will go towards defraying
some of those costs. It's not like I am salting it away. The public
image is that doctors are wealthy ... I should stress that I have
no financial resources on the outside at the present time ...
I have lost everything.&quot; Some would ask by comparison ...
who has lost more. </I>
<P>
<I>In Barrie, Scot Urquhart Channel Eleven News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Gun Control</H3>

<P>
Justice Minister Allan Rock's controversial gun control bill received
royal assent and became law today. 
<P>
Bill C-68 requires the registration of all firearms and crack
down on the use of guns by criminals. Prime Minister Chretien
calls it the toughest gun law in the western world. 
<HR>

<H3>Montreal Engineers </H3>

<P>
The event that sparked the gun control bill will mark its sixth
anniversary tomorrow... in the time that has passed since Marc
Lepine went on a shooting rampage killing fourteen female students
at a Montreal engineering school, there are more women with the
faculty than ever before. 
<HR>

<H3>Chretien Intruder </H3>

<P>
The man charged with trying to kill the Prime Minister has been
remanded in custody for more psychiatric examinations. 
<P>
Thirty four year old Andr&eacute; Dallaire of Montreal will be
back in court on January fourth. Dallaire was charged after last
month's break in at the PM's residence. An intruder made it all
the way to the door of the Prime Minister's bedroom armed with
a knife. 
<HR>

<H3>Omnibus Walkout</H3>

<P>
It seems Finance Minister Ernie Eves has bowed to pressure brought
on by the opposition over the so called omnibus bill. 
<P>
Today, New Democrat MPPs walked out of the legislature en masse
to protest the bill. 
<P>
Meanwhile, labour groups hand delivered their own message to the
Harris government to nix bill 26. Finance Minister Ernie Eves
now says there will be more debate and public hearings. 
<HR>

<H3>Immunization</H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, Health Minister Jim Wilson has announced a 4.5-million
dollar plan to give Ontario's children and young people a second
vaccination against red measles. 
<P>
The immunization campaign will involve two million elementary
and high school students. A single dose of vaccine is currently
administered during infancy, but that fails to protect five to
10 per cent of the population. 
<P>
Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health has called for a mass
vaccination campaign as there has been an increase in the incidence
of measles and they can have serious complications. 
<HR>

<H3>Rent Control </H3>

<P>
Ontario will begin lifting rent controls next spring, but only
on luxury tenant housing to begin with. the rest is to follow
in 1997. 
<P>
Municipal Affairs Minister Al Leach says controls will remain
on low-end rental stock until a new system is designed to protect
tenants. And Leach says buildings for people with special needs,
such as seniors and the disabled, may be protected by rent control
indefinitely. 
<P>
Leach also says rent control exemptions on new buildings will
continue indefinitely to encourage more construction. 
<HR>

<H3>Ontario Welfare </H3>

<P>
Ontario's welfare caseload dropped by almost 22-thousand people
last month. 
<P>
The decrease of 1.6 per cent over October represents almost 10-thousand
households. Social Services Minister David Tsubouchi says it's
not clear if Tory policies were the defining factor in the lower
numbers, but he hopes so. 
<P>
Poverty groups say people have just given up going after the paltry
sum the Tories are offering. 
<HR>

<H3>New Coin </H3>

<P>
The doubloon is a step closer to your pocket...the first two-dollar
coins started rolling off the presses today at the Royal Canadian
Mint in Winnipeg. 
<P>
The coin is 28 millimetres in diameter, has a bronze centre, an
outer rim of nickel, and features a polar bear standing on an
ice floe. But don't look for the doublooney at banks and stores
just yet. It will be February before the coin goes into circulation.

<H3>Bernardo Home Preps </H3>

<P>
The former home of serial killer Paul Bernardo will be demolished
tomorrow morning. 
<P>
Workers from 12 demolition crews will arrive on the scene at eight-a.m.,
to begin the task of destroying the house where teenagers Kristen
French and Leslie Mahaffy were held captive and murdered. 
<P>
A steady stream of gawkers made one final trip today, to see the
infamous site.
<HR>

<H3>NATO-Bosnia</H3>

<P>
The Bosnian Serbs are planning a December twelfth referendum to
challenge the peace accord reached in Dayton, Ohio.
<P>
Meanwhile, the first troops of the NATO peacekeeping force that
will monitor the implementation of the peace deal have arrived
in Sarajevo. 56 British troops and equipment landed in the Bosnian
capital this morning. 
<P>
The advance contingent will set up communications for 25-hundred
other soldiers, who will arrive over the next few weeks. And the
first lot of Americans also arrived. twenty thousand US troops
will take part in the peacekeeping mission. 
<HR>

<H3>Bosnia Clip </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, in the House of Commons, the debate over whether or
not Canada should send any troops to Bosnia started in earnest
today. 
<P>
Defence Minister David Collenette indicated Canada will join the
NATO force, if only to preserve our international reputation.
Collenette says every NATO country will be participating. 
<P>
Collenette wouldn't say how many troops would be sent but it will
cost seventy million dollars. A final decision on Bosnian troop
deployment will be made by cabinet on Wednesday. 
<HR>

<H3>Krop Viz </H3>

<P>
Patients and supporters of Dr. Joseph Krop demonstrated outside
the offices of the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons.

<P>
Dr. Krop is a practitioner of alternative medicine, and has been
accused of incompetence and professional misconduct by the college.
However, his patients say Krop's consideration of diet and environment
is sensible and works. 
<P>
Krop's lawyer says the charges against him should be dropped,
because it has taken six years for the case to be heard. 
<HR>

<H3>Rural Doctors </H3>

<P>
The provincial government says it will help rural hospitals provide
24-hour emergency medical care. 
<P>
Health Minister Jim Wilson has introduced a plan to pay doctors
in small towns and cities 70-dollars an hour for night work and
on weekends and holidays. The payments should relieve the problem
of doctors not wanting to work odd shifts in rural emergency wards.
About 67 communities currently don't have full-time emergency
services. 
<HR>

<H3>Omnibus Bill </H3>

<P>
Opposition parties at Queens Park say the Harris government can
no longer be trusted. 
<P>
They hounded the government again today for bringing in an all
encompassing bill which will give the government unprecedented
powers. 
<HR>

<H3>Arts-Cuts </H3>

<P>
Actors, writers and directors have banded together to fight the
Harris government's cuts to cultural funding. 
<P>
Dozens of entertainers told a Queens Park news conference that
it is wrong for the government to say spending on arts and culture
is helping to create Ontario's deficit, when the arts create thousands
of jobs and generate 10-billion dollars or five per-cent of Ontario's
gross domestic product. 
<P>
The group says culture also defines our Canadian identity. And
for that reason alone we cannot afford to let it disappear for
a lack of funding. 
<HR>

<H3>France Strike </H3>

<P>
France's Prime Minister has called an emergency cabinet meeting
as a public workers strike spreads. 
<P>
The eleven day strike has crippled the country's cities as public
transportation has almost ground to a halt, stranding nearly one
million commuters. And the students have staged violent protests
as well .. the reason... government cutbacks..., 
<HR>

<H3>Queen Mum</H3>

<P>
The Queen Mother left hospital today, walking gingerly after having
her right hip replaced 18 days ago. 
<P>
The 95-year-old mother of the Queen smiled and waved at photographers
from the steps of King Edward the eighth Hospital for Officers.

<P>
The most popular member of the royal family has enjoyed robust
health until quite recently when a number of ailments have required
medical attention. 
<HR>

<H3>Santa Mandela </H3>

<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela has been named International
Santa Claus of the year. 
<P>
The award, which includes a 100-thousand dollar prize, honors
Mandela's work with children. It was chosen by a foundation in
Greenland, which claims to be the homeland of old saint nick.

<HR>

<H3>Peel Cops Toys </H3>

<P>
Peel Police were playing Santa as they held their annual toy drive.

<P>
The police take donations of Canadian Tire money, and then go
on a shopping spree. The toys are then given to the Salvation
Army and the charitable group distributes them to needy kids for
Christmas. 
<HR>

<H3>Trolley Cars </H3>

<P>
And a familiar sight in the streets of Toronto will soon be no
longer. 
<P>
The old trolley cars that have been in use for more than forty
years, will be retired at the end of this week. 
<P>
Two of them have been restored and will be kept for historical
interest... but they will no longer run any routes. 
<P>
Many passengers say they'll miss the old trolleys, even though
they were hot and stuffy in the summer months, and cold and drafty
in the winter. 
<HR>

<H3>Davies Obit </H3>

<P>
Readers around the world are mourning the death over the weekend
of internationally acclaimed author, Robertson Davies. 
<P>
The Canadian literary giant died in hospital in Orangeville. He
had pneumonia. 
<P>
Davies works included three trilogies, the most famous being the
Deptford trilogy including the renowned novel, Fifth Business.

<P>
In addition to his writing, Davies was a teacher, critic, playwright
and newspaperman. His publisher said the author's genius lay in
his ability to create an accurate picture of Canadian life, while
making you aware of human nature in all its variety. 
<P>
Davies had a knack of crystallizing revelations in one perfectly
crafted sentence. He won the Nobel prize in 1993. 
<P>
There will be a public memorial for Davies on Friday evening at
University of Toronto's Convocation Hall.

<H3>Eves Speaks </H3>

<P>
Fresh from being called a liar, Premier Mike Harris adamantly
rejected reports that his election promise on tax cuts might get
watered down. 
<P>
But his Finance Minister Ernie Eves wasn't quite so adamant about
possible changes to the promised tax cuts. Both men made post
mini-budget speeches at a combined Canadian and Empire Clubs in
Toronto today.

<H3>Tory Poll </H3>

<P>
Despite massive cuts this week, the Ontario Tories are still holding
a solid lead in decided voter support. But a new poll does indicate
that the honeymoon is waning. 
<P>
An Angus Reid poll released today indicates the conservatives
have 50 per cent of decided voter support. The Liberals are next
with 30 per cent while the New Democrats had 19 per cent support.
The poll says Tory support has dropped eight points since an October
poll, while the Liberals gained five points and NDP gained three
points. 
<HR>

<H3>UI Reforms </H3>

<P>
A major reworking of the unemployment insurance system was introduced
in the commons today by the federal government. 
<P>
Under the proposals, benefits will be cut, Canadians will have
to work longer to qualify for UI, and benefits will last up to
40 weeks instead of the current 50. 
<P>
Those and other changes are expected to save up to two-billion
dollars, which will be re-directed toward job-training and income
supplement. 
<P>
Human Resources minister Lloyd Axworthy -- who is responsible
for the UI overhaul -- says the system desperately needs updating.
Axworthy says it was set up 50 years ago when unemployment was
low and people held the same jobs for life. 
<HR>

<H3>Jobless Rate </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile the job market remains fairly static in Canada. 
<P>
The national unemployment rate was unchanged last month, still
standing at 9.4 per cent. Hamilton continues to have the lowest
jobless rate in the country at 5.9 percent. 
<P>
Toronto's employment picture brightened slightly. It came in at
7.8 percent, while the St. Catharines/ Niagara area experienced
an increase in its jobless rate to 8.6 per cent. 
<HR>

<H3>Reform Radical </H3>

<P>
Ominous activity in Quebec today... fourteen radical separatists,
including a former FLQ bomber, are starting a new political party
in Quebec. 
<P>
Members of the National Liberation Movement feel Quebec's current
leaders are too soft on separation. Raymond Villeneuve was an
FLQ bomber back in the early seventies when violence marked the
separatist movement. And that has raised concerns about the activities
of this new group. 
<HR>

<H3>Unity </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, the controversial shortcut to recognizing Quebec as
a distinct society is on its way through the house of commons,
as quickly as possible.. 
<P>
The government introduced a motion today limiting debate on the
part of the legislation that gives the regions a constitutional
veto. The motion has angered the Reform Party and the western
provincial leaders, who don't like being lumped in together, and
don't like Quebec getting any special treatment. 
<HR>

<H3>Cop Funeral </H3>

<P>
Some 15-hundred police officers from across North America were
in Montreal today for the funeral of a fallen colleague. 
<P>
Constable Odette Pinard -- a 30-year-old mother of two -- was
shot four days ago while sitting at her desk at a community policing
office. More than 50 investigators are on the case, and at least
800 people have been interviewed. despite that, police say they
have no suspects and no motive. 
<HR>

<H3>Basketball Death </H3>

<P>
A 19-year-old student who collapsed during a school basketball
practice in Toronto, has died. 
<P>
Sheldon Aberdeen of Oasis High School crumpled on the court at
Bloor Collegiate around eight thirty this morning. The coroner's
office is investigating. 
<HR>

<H3>Baby Anne </H3>

<P>
The Children's Aid Society of Toronto held a news conference this
afternoon to update reporters on the baby Anne case. 
<P>
She's the infant who was found abandoned in a cardboard box. The
Children's Aid Society has been awarded interim care, and on December
twentieth the Society will seek to have permanent wardship so
that the adoption process may begin. 
<P>
Baby Anne has a foster home for Christmas, and hospital staff
say she's up to the event. Efforts to find the baby's parents
have so far failed. 
<HR>

<H3>MADD Launch </H3>

<P>
The LCBO store at Queens Quay in Toronto has been wrapped with
a 500-foot ribbon, officially launching the month-long red ribbon
campaign. Mothers Against Drunk Driving chair, Tony Carvalho and
LCBO chief Andy Brandt led the ceremonies. 
<P>
The program encourages people to tie one on ...by putting a red
ribbon on their car aerial in a show of support for getting drunk
drivers off the road. 
<P>
Throughout December, all Ontario LCBO stores will offer the red
ribbons to customers... and coin donation boxes will be displayed.

<HR>

<H3>World AIDS Day </H3>

<P>
Today is world AIDS day. A day to recognize that 20 million people
around the globe are HIV positive. A quarter of them have developed
full blown aids. 
<P>
While there is still no cure for the deadly disease, the federal
government is terminating funding for its national AIDS strategy.
Combined with cuts from Queen's Park, AIDS activists are up in
arms. Dwight Ryan has the story. 
<P>
<I>Members of Toronto's gay community slam the government for
cutbacks. While countries around the globe are marking world AIDS
day, Canada is in the midst of phasing out its national AIDS strategy.
</I>
<P>
<I>The program won't be renewed for a third term when it runs
out in 1998. Toronto gays say its time to get more active. </I>
<P>
<I>McCaskell says Canadians must realize that AIDS and HIV are
not gay issues. In fact the population group facing the biggest
increase in AIDS and HIV is heterosexual women. They in turn often
have babies that are HIV positive.</I>
<P>
<I>The Canadian college of family physicians has now introduced
a comprehensive guide for members of the medical community who
find themselves dealing with AIDS patients more often. Many of
them children. </I>
<P>
<I>Twenty million people in the world have HIV. Four and a half
million have developed full blown AIDS.</I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Dwight Ryan, channel 11 news.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>French Strike </H3>

<P>
France has been crippled by a massive strike by public workers...
trains, busses, planes are ground to a halt...and so is the traffic
in the country's major cities... hospitals are also effected,
and the French are become weary and worried about how long it
will go on. 
<P>
Union workers are protesting a government move to cut back on
their pensions. 
<P>
Meanwhile, students have waged their own campaign demanding more
government spending... a campaign of violence.
<HR>

<H3>Malle Funeral </H3>

<P>
Many of France's leading stars from the French cinema paid their
last respects to French director Louis Malle today. 
<P>
The funeral was held at the church of St. Sulpice in Paris. Malle
leaves behind his wife, actress Candice Bergen and their daughter.
He died of lymphoma at their Beverly hills home. Malle was known
for films such as pretty baby, Atlantic city, and my dinner with
Andr&eacute;.

<H3>QP Follow </H3>

<P>
A number of Liberal MPP's stormed out of the legislature in a

Plant has come under fire in a letter from the atomic energy control
board. 
<P>

unnecessarily and undermine its economic interests. 
<HR>

<H3>Veto Bill </H3>

<P>
Hamilton's Sheila Copps injected emotion into Parliament's post
referendum unity debate today. 
<P>

<H3>Mini Budget </H3>

<P>
Never before has Ontario seen anything like it ... that's what
analysts are saying after today's mini budget from the Tories.

<P>
Municipalities, educational institutions, and health care will
strongly feel the financial squeeze as the Harris government cuts
5.5 billion dollars to get its fiscal house in order. Finance
Minister Ernie Eves says he will balance the provincial budget
while boosting economic growth to create jobs. Bob Ireland has
more from Queens Park. 
<P>
<I>Currently the Ontario government spends one million dollars
an hour more than it receives in revenues. Interest costs alone
on the provincial debt amounts to nine billion dollars. The government's
money goes out in grants to hospitals, universities, colleges
and municipalities. and those areas got hit the hardest in Ernie
eves economic statement. </I>
<P>
<I>As a result, the trickle down effect will mean every Ontarian
will share in the pain. Transfers to school boards will be cut
by 400 million dollars in the next fiscal year.  But they are
warned not to get it back by raising local taxes. </I>
<P>
<I>Funding for colleges and universities will be reduced by 400
million. But next year universities will be allowed to increase
tuition fees by a base ten per-cent, and be given the discretion
to increase costs to students a further 10 per-cent. College fees
will go up 15 per cent. </I>
<P>
<I>Hospitals will see their grants cut by 1.3 billion dollars
over the next three years. But more money will be made available
for treatment of brain injuries and immunization programs. </I>
<P>
<I>Effective June first next year seniors and welfare recipients,
receiving benefits under the Ontario drug benefit program will
have to pay an extra two dollars for each prescription. And families
with incomes over 24-thousand dollars a year, will be asked to
pay a deductible 100-dollars a year. </I>
<P>
<I>The government will reduce funding to municipalities by one
billion dollars. Grants for municipal recycling will be phased
out. Libraries, and local transit grants will be reduced. </I>
<P>
<I>Finance Minister Eves says, unconditional and road grants will
be folded into a single block fund. And municipalities will have
the flexibility to spend according to their priorities. Municipalities
will also be given the power to charge user fees for some services
like garbage collection to name just one. </I>
<P>
<I>Liberal Leader Lyn McLeod accused the Harris government of
taking money out of health care and education to pay for his future
30 percent tax cut. </I>
<P>
<I>NDP leader Bob Rae calls the economic statement a dishonest
document. </I>
<P>
<I>Finance Minister Eves is projecting real growth this year of
2.1 per-cent.. and 3.1 per-cent by 1997. He also predicts inflation
will stay below two per-cent through the next three years. </I>
<P>
<I>At Queens Park, Bob Ireland, Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Labor Demo </H3>

<P>
Government workers demonstrated in front of a Canada Employment
Centre in Ottawa today to protest expected federal cuts to unemployment
insurance. 
<P>
Under changes to be announced Friday, about 100- thousand families
would lose U.I. benefits, while about 35 thousand families would
get more. That's because benefits will be pegged to family rather
than individual income. And it will be tougher to qualify in the
first place. 
<HR>

<H3>Highway Safety</H3>

<P>
A pilot program was launched in Kitchener today that will see
motorists helping others who are in trouble. 
<P>
Called Highway Help, the program is expected to be province-wide
by this time next year. The story from Dwight Ryan. 
<P>
<I>Thousands of motorists pull off to the side with health or
vehicle problems each day. But few people are willing to help,
often fearing for their own safety. </I>
<P>
<I>A new program introduced today in Kitchener is designed to
help alleviate the problem. Called Highway Help, motorists will
be given signs to display on their drivers' window. Passers-by
are encouraged to call police on their cellphone or C.B. radio
...but not to stop. </I>
<P>
<I>Chief Kevin McAlpine of Peterborough is president of the Ontario
Association of Chiefs of Police.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Needle Machine </H3>

<P>
For health care workers the disposal of used needles has become
a critically important procedure, especially since the beginning
of the AIDS epidemic. The question has always been ... what is
the best method? 
<P>
Well a Brantford entrepreneur thinks he has the answer in a machine
that eats the potentially deadly bits of metal.... Jamie West
reports... 
<P>
<I>And it appears Ralph Haines has done just that. The Needle
Eater is being gobbled up by dentists and doctors faster than
the Brantford production line can keep up... </I>
<P>
<I>There are at least 50 known blood born pathogens that can be
transmitted through used needles... </I>
<P>
<I>After 17 years of selling insurance Haines was bitten by the
entrepreneurial bug. 149 days from the drawing board the Needle
Eater was born. An electrical charge incinerates the needle and
seals the end of the syringe that can then be put in the regular
garbage. The machine can handle thousands of needles before the
residual ashes needs to be emptied.</I>
<P>
<I>The modest assembly line produces about 100 Needle Eaters a
week. Diabetic models retail for 99 dollars, and are available
through the Canadian Diabetic Association. Larger hospital use
machines sell for about 249 dollars.</I>
<P>
