<H3>Budget Advance </H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris says tomorrow's economic statement, or what
some call a mini budget, will send a signal that his government
is moving in a new direction of fiscal responsibility. But many
feel the government is moving too fast. 
<HR>

<H3>Cop Killing </H3>

<P>
Police in Montreal have launched an intensive investigation after
one of their own was shot to death. 
<P>
Someone walked into a small station where 30-year-old Constable
Odette Pinard was working alone. She was shot in the face. Just
two weeks ago, Pinard returned from maternity leave after giving
birth to her second child. 
<P>
There are no leads yet in the murder... but Montreal police chief
Jacques Duchesneau has vowed to leave no stone unturned in finding
her killer. 
<HR>

<H3>Drug Bust </H3>

<P>
Ten people from Kitchener- Waterloo and Metro Toronto face numerous
drug-related charges after drug squad mounties and regional police
in Waterloo seized seven pounds of cocaine and three pounds of
crack cocaine, as well as 30- thousand dollars in cash. 
<P>
Police say the suspects were involved with highly sophisticated
Caribbean drug organizations responsible for trafficking large
quantities of crack cocaine. The bust came at the conclusion of
a 2-month under- cover investigation. 
<HR>

<H3>Vineland Crash </H3>

<P>
A 73 year old Vineland woman is fighting for her life in hospital
after being struck by a pick up truck. 
<P>
Police say Mary Sawatsky was walking along Orchard Avenue with
bags of groceries when she was hit. Sawatsky is listed in critical
condition. The investigation is continuing. 
<HR>

<H3>Road Ice </H3>

<P>
Even though it's still November, Ontario drivers had a taste of
January weather this morning, after a winter storm dumped everything
from heavy snow to freezing rain on area roadways overnight. 
<P>
The storm blanketed cottage country and eastern Ontario with twenty
to thirty centimetres of snow. 
<P>
Further south, freezing rain coated the stretch between Kitchener
and Toronto for three to six hours. 
<P>
Meanwhile, an arctic air mass that followed the storm has ushered
in the coldest weather of the winter so far. Tonight, temperatures
will plunge to well below minus ten degrees across most of southern
Ontario. 
<HR>

<H3>Rushton Charge</H3>

<P>
A human rights complaint against a University of Western Ontario
professor has petered out. 
<P>
Four years after he prompted outrage by claiming whites are intellectually
superior to blacks, Phillipe Rushton was told yesterday that the
Ontario Human Rights Commission has abandoned his case. 
<HR>

<H3>Missing Man </H3>

<P>
Police in Lindsay say they received several calls from Hamilton
after we broadcast a missing person report on last night's Evening
News program.

Those calls indicate that 90- year-old Harold Britton of Niagara
falls, New York, may have been spotted in downtown Hamilton. 
<P>
He was last seen October 21st, as he left a friend's house in
Lindsay. He is a diabetic and was out of insulin.

<P>
Corporal Walter James Postma of Hamilton is among eight Canadian
soldiers who have been given Governor General Awards for mentions
in dispatches during their service in hot spots. 
<P>
Mentions in Dispatches were created to recognize members of the
service for valiant conduct or other distinguished service. Recipients
can wear a bronze oak leaf on their uniform. 
<P>
Another Ontario man, Master Corporal William Tate of Galt, also
received an award. 
<HR>

<H3>Christmas Credit </H3>

<P>
'tis the season to go shopping. 
<P>
But it's also the season for consumers to go deeply into debt.
Come January credit counselors are dealing with the post Christmas
blues. Lauran Sabourin has more in this report. 
<P>
<I>Forget the bells and the Christmas carols. This is the sound
heard throughout the malls at Christmas season. People ringing
up their charge card to the max. </I>
<P>
<I>Easy to say you're going to be more frugal this year. But when
it comes to giving your child a Christmas budget constraints are
not a priority. </I>
<P>
<I>It's estimated Canadian consumers will spend about 15 billion
dollars this season. Collectively going billions of dollars into
debt. </I>
<P>
<I>In January, many debt ridden consumers find themselves sitting
across from people like Michael Mates, Credit Counselor. Their
stories are so familiar. The more money people make. The more
money they spend. Typically credit counselors will see people
who owe 70 percent of their gross annual income. </I>
<P>
<I>Credit counselors have advice for consumers. If you're going
to spend at Christmas, pay cash. If you have to use credit. put
a strict limit on it. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Ford Recall</H3>

<P>
Ford of Canada is recalling 248-thousand 1989, '90 and '91-model
vehicles to check an ignition switch. 
<P>
Ford says the switch could develop a short circuit, resulting
in a potential fire in the steering column area. 
<P>
Customers are being notified by mail to return their vehicles
to dealers for replacement of the switch, free of charge. 
<HR>

<H3>Lighter Warning </H3>

<P>
Ottawa has issued a health protection warning about some brands
of disposable cigarette lighters. 
<P>
Comet, King and Taiyo lighters are made in China and Thailand.
The government says the lighters have a variety of defects that
make them potentially dangerous. 
<HR>

<H3>Lips Together </H3>

<P>
The unusually titled &quot;Lips Together, Teeth Apart,&quot; is
connecting with audiences at Toronto's St. Lawrence Centre. 
<P>
Alex Reynolds reports on the comedy/drama, which has a realistic
theme - lack of communication in marriage. 
<P>
Terrance McNally, the award-winning playwright, makes audiences
think, with themes that reflect life in these terrific and terrifying
times. 
<P>
In &quot;Lips Together, Teeth Apart,&quot; two couples spend the
July 4th weekend at a beach house on Fire Island, the notorious
Long Island, New York gay resort area. 
<P>
The play looks at the four, out of sync with themselves, as well
as each other. The matrimonial state hasn't been smooth for Sam,
Sally, John and Chloe. A calm surface masking turbulence in their
unions. As the holiday hours pass, hidden thoughts reveal infidelities,
betrayals and fears. 
<P>
Playwright McNally plays out this scenario against the revelry
of a patriotic celebration. It's a happy time, but a good time
is not being had by all. 
<P>
The Canadian Stage Company production stars the always marvelous
Fiona Reid with strong work from Nancy Beatty, Layne Coleman and
Ron White. Jim Guedo has directed his charges skillfully in lifting
mcnally's timely issues from page to stage.
<P>
&quot;Lips Together, Teeth Apart&quot; plays through December
16th at the St. Lawrence Centre. in Toronto, Alex Reynolds, Channel
Eleven News.

<H3>Basket Baby </H3>

<P>
The baby was abandoned, but not left to die. That's the early
theory Toronto police have as they search to find the parents
of a baby girl found in a cardboard box. 
<P>
&quot;Baby Anne&quot; as she's now been named by hospital staff
, made a sleepy appearance at a news conference today. Kathy Renwald
reports. 
<P>
<I>Baby Anne is a healthy baby who survived the first hours of
her life abandoned in a snow sprinkled cardboard box. </I>
<P>
<I>As nurses held on to the newborn, Bruce Rivers of the Toronto
Children's Aid described the next step in this sad mystery. Baby
Anne was found in a driveway outside a Scarborough home, she has
recovered quickly from exposure. </I>
<P>
<I>Because baby Anne was found outside a home, police and childcare
workers believe the parents wanted her to be found. But now finding
the mother or the father becomes a faint hope. Baby Anne was born
without any medical assistance...her abandonment is a cause of
great concern to the Children's Aid Society. </I>
<P>
<I>There are many adoptive parents waiting for babies...but for
now Baby Anne will be placed on a temporary basis, while officials
try to find the birth parents. </I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto Kathy Renwald Channel 11 News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Hannon Hooker </H3>

<P>
Ryerson part-time instructor Gerald Hannon is fighting to get
his teaching job back. 
<P>
Hannon was suspended by the Toronto university after he told a
Toronto newspaper he helps pay the bills by working as a prostitute.

<P>
Hannon is also being investigated by the university for his comments
supporting sex between adults and children. 
<P>
The Canadian Union of Public Employees has filed a grievance on
Hannon's behalf, demanding he be reinstated. 
<HR>

<H3>Chretien-Quebec </H3>

<P>
Ottawa is going to declare Quebec a distinct society. 
<P>
Prime Minister Chretien says a notice of motion will be made in
the commons this week. But he says Quebec cannot be declared distinct
in the Constitution because so far the Parti Quebecois government
refuses to agree to constitutional negotiations. 
<P>
Chretien is also offering Quebec, Ontario and the Atlantic and
western regions a constitutional veto. 
<HR>

<H3>Harris-Ottawa </H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris took his &quot;cut-cut-cut&quot; message to
the nation's capital today... paving the way for Wednesday's &quot;mini-budget&quot;.

<P>
The ax is expected to fall on provincial transfer payments to
municipalities and school boards, as well as colleges, universities
and hospitals. For his part, the Premier told Ottawa's business
leaders to make sure special interest groups don't drown out what
he calls the real message. 
<HR>

<H3>Jail Closures </H3>

<P>
Seventeen Ontario jails are expected to fall beneath the budget
ax. 
<P>
Jails in Chatham and Fort Frances, in northwestern Ontario, are
thought to be on the hit list. The president of the Ontario Public
Service Employees' Union, Leah Casselman says Ontario's jails
are already overcrowded, and hundreds of convicted offenders are
already released every weekend on temporary absence permits because
the system can't handle them. 
<HR>

<H3>School Boards OSSTF</H3>

<P>
A new public opinion poll suggests that the majority of Ontarians
would favor having a single school board at the local level. 
<P>
The survey also indicates most people believe public Catholic
and Francophone schools should share facilities. 
<HR>

<H3>Abduction </H3>

<P>
There's still no word on the fate of three Toronto residents who
were abducted from a Scarborough home. 
<P>
The three were taken at gunpoint last Friday night, apparently
because of an unpaid debt to an Asian gang. Heavily-armed police
raided a home in east Toronto yesterday as part of the search
for the trio, but they came up empty handed. 
<P>
Missing are 32-year-old Zhan Ning Yang and her mother and father.

<HR>

<H3>Missing Man </H3>

<P>
Lindsay police are asking for the public's help in locating a
ninety year old man who has been missing since October twenty
first. 
<P>
Harold Britton of Niagara Falls New York is a diabetic and he
left his friends' home in Lindsay specifically because he had
run out of insulin. He hasn't been seen since. 
<P>
Harold Britton is described as ninety years of age, grey hair,
five feet nine inches tall, one hundred and eighty pounds and
wearing glasses. He was driving a green Chrysler Lebaron with
New York plates &quot;nbl561&quot;. 
<P>
Anyone with information is asked to call Lindsay Police Service
at area code 705-324-5252. 
<HR>

<H3>Bosnia Danger </H3>

<P>
The United Nations is concerned tension in Sarajevo could hinder
the peace agreement. 
<P>
Under the accord, the Muslim-Croat Federation will control the
capitol. That has Bosnian Serbs on edge.

<H3>Ontario Day Care </H3>

<P>
Thousands of working parents across Ontario were scrambling today
to find some one to look after their children. 
<P>
More than a thousand day-care centres throughout the province
closed for the day in protest against cuts to day care funding
by the Harris government. 
<HR>

<H3>Hill Demo </H3>

<P>
And there was a simultaneous demonstration on Parliament Hill
in Ottawa... against the possibility of the Mike Harris ax falling
on subsidized day care... as hundreds gathered in the bitter cold,
singing protest chants to the tune of Christmas carols. 
<P>
And there were a number of other rallies in communities across
the province, as well. Little Celeste and Aurora Antoft have decided
to send loonies to Premier Mike Harris... along with a letter...

<HR>

<H3>Kain-Legislature </H3>

<P>
Canada's premier ballerina came calling on Premier Mike Harris
today. But he wasn't home. 
<P>
Karen Kain and other national ballet members of the &quot;Nut-Cracker&quot;
Suite, wanted to give Premier Harris some Christmas mail... 10-thousand
letters from supporters of the ballet, urging the government to
continue funding the Ontario Arts Council. 
<P>
But Mike Harris is home in North Bay, so the letters were left
with Queens Park security officers. 
<P>
Kain says the arts are not a frill to be cut. 
<HR>

<H3>Montreal Blast </H3>

<P>
Police in Laval, Quebec, say a man died early today when a bomb
in his car exploded on a highway north of Montreal. 
<P>
The bomb was placed near the driver's seat and appears to have
been triggered by a remote-control device. The four-wheel-drive
vehicle was torn apart by the blast. 
<P>
A war between motorcycle gangs for control of street-drugs in
the Montreal area has killed dozens of people in the last two
years. 
<HR>

<H3>Peel Cops Charged </H3>

<P>
Two uniformed patrol officers with Peel Regional Police have been
charged in a home invasion earlier this month in Mississauga.

<P>
After answering her front door, a woman in her mid-20's was sprayed
in the eyes, pushed to the ground and bound with tape. 
<P>
27 year old Trevor Babott of Hamilton, a five year veteran of
the Peel force, and 26 year old George Bonsu of Mississauga, a
four year veteran, face several charges, including robbery, assault
with a weapon and forcible confinement. 
<P>
Three years ago, Constable Babott received an award of bravery
from the Peel force. 
<HR>

<H3>Peel Tag </H3>

<P>
Less than one hundred dollars was stolen during the home invasion.
The officers could be fired if convicted. 
<HR>

<H3>Lamontagne follow </H3>

<P>
Prominent Port Colborne businessman Gil Lamontagne has been convicted
on three counts of sexually assaulting his eldest daughter. 
<P>
Donna Beaudoin was sexually abused by her father from the age
of seven. 
<P>
Lauran Sabourin spoke with Donna Beaudoin and has this report.

<P>
<I>For Donna Beaudoin reliving the horror of being sexually abused
by her father was one of the most difficult things she's ever
done. Recounting in graphic detail in front of a courtroom of
strangers how her father Gil Lamontagne assaulted her repeatedly
from the age of seven. A family secret she hid from her mother
out of fear of being rejected. </I>
<P>
<I>Donna was viciously abused. Assaulted with objects ranging
from Barbie dolls to test tubes. </I>
<P>
<I>At the age of 13 her father got her pregnant. She had an abortion.
Something that torments her to this day. </I>
<P>
<I>Look at childhood pictures and Donna's face doesn't reveal
the abuse going on behind closed doors at home. She says for years
she was living a lie. </I>
<P>
<I>It's a big step for sex assault victims to come forward. An
even bigger step for them to tell the community what happened
to them. So why did donna come forward with such serious charges
against her father. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Leeson Court</H3>

<P>
The man accused of breaking Britain's Barings Bank was formally
charged in Singapore today. 
<P>
28-year-old Nick Leeson stands accused of forging documents to
hide a string of costly unauthorized gambles on Japanese stocks
... to the tune of one point four billion dollars.

<H3>Doctors-Billing</H3>

<P>
Forcing physicians to practice in rural and remote areas won't
work, says an association representing interns and resident doctors.

<P>
This as the Harris government looks at restricting billing numbers,
as a way of encouraging doctors to work in the north. 
<HR>

<H3>Business Survey </H3>

<P>
A new public opinion poll commissioned by the business community
finds that 77 per cent of Ontarians surveyed oppose union plans
to protest the Harris government's policies. And 53 per-cent agree
with the repeal of the NDP's anti scab law. 
<P>
Yesterday the Ontario Federation of Labor confirmed that it was
going ahead with its series of one-day work stoppages across the
province, starting December 11th in London, and labor took its
message right to the heart of Canadian business. Today business
retaliated with the results of their public opinion poll. 
<HR>

<H3>Gun Recut </H3>

<P>
Ottawa's controversial gun control law passed in the senate last
night ... making firearms restrictions in this country tighter
than just about anywhere else. 
<P>
Reform MPs, who opposed the bill, vow to make it an issue in the
next election. 
<HR>

<H3>Gun Law Rxn.</H3>

<P>
But opposition to the gun control measures is spread far and wide...
and as Lauran Sabourin reports tonight ... gun owners intend to
continue firing ... verbal vollies, that is. 
<P>
<I>If there has been any issue recently that has touched a raw
nerve with Canadian gun owners its the law that requires them
to register all of their weapons.</I>
<P>
<I>Frank Ryan is the owner of Frontier Gun Shop in Fonthill. </I>
<P>
<I>Ryan says ever since the government has been talking about
putting restrictions on gun ownership his business has dropped
significantly. Specifically the legislation bans a variety of
handguns and puts restrictions on other types rifles. The government
says its an effort to curb crime. </I>
<P>
<I>The problems as Ryan sees it lie with handguns not sport weapons.
Handguns primarily that are smuggled across the border and land
in the hands of the criminals. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Victims Bill</H3>

<P>
Ontario has become the last province in Canada to have a victims
Bill of Rights. 
<P>
In bringing in the legislation today, Attorney General Charles
Harnick says the new bill will ensure crime victims will get supportive
and courteous treatment. 
<P>
The new legislation will also financially compensate victims of
crime. 
<HR>

<H3>Student Testing </H3>

<P>
The province today announced it is putting a new school testing
program in place. 
<P>
The new program, the first of its kind in Canada, will test students
in grade three and eleven, and randomly test grade six and grade
nine students. 
<P>
Education Minister John Snobelen says he hopes the new program
will improve students' performance and public confidence in the
school system. The first test will be given in the next school
year. 
<HR>

<H3>Sex Harassment-Man</H3>

<P>
From Port Richey, Florida, comes a land mark decision in a civil
court action. 
<P>
A male worker has proven that he was sexually harassed by his
female boss. He took domino's pizza to court... and won.

<H3>Labor Vs Harris</H3>

<P>
A thousand organized labour protesters took their anti-right wing
message directly to the heart of Toronto's business district today.

<P>
All of this in yet another of many protests against Premier Mike
Harris's massive cuts in social spending. 
<HR>

<H3>Jesse Jackson</H3>

<P>
Meanwhile... the Reverend Jesse Jackson says Ontario union members
should back the New Democratic Party. 
<P>
In an emotional appeal, the American preacher and politician urged
delegates at the OFL convention to work with the NDP to bring
down Ontario Premier Mike Harris. Jackson warned that Harris is
on the same track as American Republicans toward tearing down
years of progress in public services and labor laws. 
<HR>

<H3>Spending Cuts</H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, municipalities are in for mixed news when the Harris
government outlines expected massive budget cuts next Wednesday.

<P>
The slashing is are expected to go far beyond the 1.9-billion-
dollars chopped last July and one leaked figure puts next week's
budget slashing in the 3.5-billion- dollar range. 
<P>
Premier Mike Harris, meanwhile, says the province's transfer partners
should look forward with &quot;enthusiasm&quot; to the cuts his
government is going to make. He says they will lead to a &quot;balanced-budget&quot;
Ontario that will be more open to investment and jobs. 
<HR>

<H3>Harris-Palladini</H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris is standing behind his transportation minister
despite news reports about Al Palladini's extramarital affair.

<P>
According to court documents, Palladini has been paying over 1500
dollars in child support payments to a woman who claims the minister
is the father of her child. 
<P>
In another civil suit an elderly woman claims Palladini owes her
50-thousand dollars on a previous business loan. Premier Harris
admitted he knew about the court actions before he appointed Palladini
to cabinet. 
<HR>

<H3>CBC layoffs</H3>

<P>
The CBC will cut up to two thousand people from its payroll by
the end of next year. 
<P>
Network President Perrin Beatty also says a total of 227 million
dollars will be chopped from its budget. Beatty says the CBC cuts
will affect both the English and French radio and TV services.
He also says there will be fewer American television shows available
for prime time. 
<HR>

<H3>Commons Wednesday</H3>

<P>
Quebec's Premier in waiting was back in Ottawa today... as leader
of her majesty's opposition. And Lucien Bouchard wasted no time
in giving the federal government a taste of what lies ahead. 
<HR>

<H3>Fatal Fire</H3>

<P>
A woman in her 60's died in a fire Tuesday evening in a Mississauga
seniors apartment building. 
<P>
The woman was found in her fifth-floor apartment. One resident
was given oxygen at the scene. Mississauga fire fighters were
able to contain the fire to one apartment. 
<P>
Damage is estimated at between five- and 10-thousand dollars.

<HR>

<H3>Early Skater</H3>

<P>
It's winter time ... and that means cold feet, a chair, a sore
back, frustration, and tears. 
<P>
Learning to skate, that great Canadian past-time, is not an easy
thing to do. Teaching someone to skate, is even worse ... or at
it least was... until now. Scot Urquhart has that story: 
<P>
<I>This is the first time that Karly Cox has ever been on skates
.... but instead of going through the usual back-breaking frustrations
... her mother is about to use a brand new invention to teach
karly to skate</I>
<P>
<I>The product came from two Burlington brothers ... former hockey
coaches ... who found that necessity truly was, the mother of
invention.</I>
<P>
<I>Four year old D.J. is now six; and skating well enough to play
rep hockey, with eight and nine year olds. </I>
<P>
<I>The Early Skater will be manufactured by Dundas toy maker M.A.
Henry; and has optional attachments to adapt it for roller blades,
and even skis. </I>
<P>
<I>This year, it will be sold exclusively by Canadian tire; but
the Whittaker's hope this all-Canadian product will soon prove
to be the skating world's answer, to trivial pursuit. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton Scot Urquhart, Channel 11 News. </I>

<H3>Harris Eve</H3>

<P>
It seems wherever Premier Mike Harris goes ...protest rallies
follow. And tonight is no exception. 
<P>
Channel 11's Marci Ien is standing by at a demonstration over
provincial cuts to social services that's just starting, as the
premier prepares to speak at a Tory fundraising dinner.
<P>
<I>Theresa Frail says she's lucky to be alive. After being brutally
assaulted...she left an abusive relationship to start a new life
with her three girls. She fears provincial cutbacks to shelters
will put abused women and children at risk. </I>
<P>
<I>McMaster student Tammy Fleming says slashing funds to colleges
and universities and higher tuition costs will lead to a system
that will cater primarily to the wealthy. </I>
<P>
<I>Churches and food banks are also facing tough times. ...with
more people in need ...and less to go around. </I>
<HR>

<H3>More Trouble</H3>

<P>
The Premier also has his problems back at Queen's Park, where
a report handed to Finance Minister Ernie Eves recommends a whopping
hike in the salaries of legislators and cabinet ministers. 
<P>
The government is in a quandary over what to do about the report's
politically poisonous recommendations. 
<P>
Yet another report recommends the closure of some small town courthouses...
but there are assurances that cabinet has not given that question
any consideration. And on top of all that, transportation minister
Al Palladini has to go to court because a married woman is claiming
that he's the father of her child. Palladini says it's a personal
matter. 
<HR>

<H3>Harris-Daycare</H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, Premier Harris doesn't think much of the planned one
day close down Friday of day care centres across Ontario. 
<P>
A day care coalition predicts that one thousand centres across
Ontario will close to protest funding cuts. The premier says the
action will only hurt parents and children. 
<HR>

<H3>College of Teachers</H3>

<P>
Queen's Park is moving to set up a College of Teachers, a self
regulating body that according to Education Minister John Snobelen,
will ensure accountability and confidence in the education system.

<P>
Teachers so far have viewed the move with some skepticism. 
<HR>

<H3>Bouchard</H3>

<P>
Bloc Quebecois leader Lucien Bouchard has decided to leave federal
politics and take on the job of Parti Quebecois leader and Premier
of Quebec. 
<P>
He's expected to be a shoo-in to the post. With his wife Audrey
best by his side, Bouchard said at a Montreal news conference
this morning, the fundamental objective of the Parti Quebecois
remains sovereignty. But he plans to focus on bread-and- butter
issues such as the economy. 
<HR>

<H3>Fort Erie Drugs</H3>

<P>
Customs officers at the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie nabbed two men
trying to smuggle two kilograms of marijuana and a loaded AK 47
assault rifle across the border. 
<P>
Customs officers became suspicious when they learned that two
children traveling with the men early Monday morning were not
related to them. Officials suspect the pair were trying to use
the kids as cover. 
<P>
Charged with drug and weapons offenses is 25 year old Otis Harvey
of London. and 28 year old Derrol Frazer of Kitchener. 
<HR>

<H3>Taxi Demo</H3>

<P>
About two hundred Toronto cabbies demonstrated their displeasure
today with the metro Toronto Licensing Commission. 
<P>
They drove in a convoy from Yonge and Steeles to metro headquarters...
creating major traffic disruptions. 
<P>
Tough new rules require cabs to be inspected three times a year...
and those with three deficiencies or more will be pulled off the
street. 
<HR>

<H3>Employment Equity </H3>

<P>
An organization called the Alliance for Employment Equity says
the intended plan of the Harris government to re-vamp the Ontario
Human Rights Code, will do more to set back the concept of equal
opportunity, than fix the system. 
<P>
The group, which has a number of human rights lawyers in its ranks,
says Mike Harris's proposed equal opportunity plan depends on
employers' voluntary participation. Human rights lawyer Mary Cornish
says it won't work unless the plan is mandatory. 
<P>
The human rights group is also calling on the government to reform
the Ontario Human Rights Commission. 
<HR>

<H3>Money Incentives </H3>

<P>
Queen's Park is a little less than luke-warm to the suggestion
that civil servants be given financial incentives for coming up
with ways to save government money. 
<P>
The recommendation came from the Ontario Finance Review Commission.
Management Board Chairman Dave Johnson says there would have to
be a lot of study before the government went down that road. 
<HR>

<H3>Red Buttons </H3>

<P>
Have you ever wondered what happened to Red Buttons? 
<P>
The 76-year-old show business veteran brought his one-man show
to the Royal Alexandra Theatre last night. 
<P>
Alex Reynolds says &quot;Buttons on Broadway&quot; was a nostalgic
journey in the career of a legendary comedian. 
<P>
<I>Comedy wears many faces. Naturally, the emphasis is on the
comedian who delivers funny lines. Red Buttons hasn't lost a step.
</I>
<P>
<I>The native New Yorker who apprenticed as a standup comic on
the borscht circuit in the Catskills, and in Minsky's Burlesque,
had the capacity audience continuously laughing with a mixture
of nostalgia, stories, songs, sketches, and memories of fellow
stars over a 60 year career. </I>
<P>
<I>Buttons could give a master class on how to be funny without
smut...which comedians seem to rely on heavily these days. </I>
<P>
<I>The red haired funny man dispenses humor without embarrassment.
</I>
<P>
<I>Button's autobiographical one-man show was a one-night only
stopover after its Broadway run. I wish you could have been there.
I literally laughed till I cried. </I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Alex Reynolds, Channel Eleven News.</I>

<H3>Finance Review </H3>

<P>
Ontario's finance review commission says the government should
go ahead with the one billion dollar construction of highway 407
from Markham to Oakville. 
<P>
The commission wants the government to monitor the 70-kilometre
&quot;407&quot; project's financial projections to make sure the
highway will not become a drain on tax revenues. The commission
also recommends that government ministries and crown agencies
prepare annual business plans and performance targets. And to

for cost saving suggestions. 
<HR>

<H3>Sejejick/Court </H3>

<P>
A 44 year-old Hamilton man made a brief court appearance today

Geraldine Copps is a Hamilton Alderman.

hearing.

A federal justice department letter to Swiss authorities last
September linked the former Conservative Prime Minister to alleged
kickbacks from Air Canada's purchase of 34 airbus jets in 1988.

<P>
Mulroney, who denies the allegations, is seeking 25- million-dollars
in damages to his reputation and 25-million in punitive damages.

<HR>

<H3>Commons Clip</H3>

<P>
The head of the Bloc Quebecois has a news conference scheduled

<HR>

<H3>Stabbing</H3>

<P>
An autopsy on Toronto's latest homicide victim has revealed the

<P>
The body of 39-year- old Hermindo Silva was found last night in

concerned when he couldn't get in touch with him. 
<HR>

<H3>Plane Hits Building</H3>

<P>
A 35-minute flight ended in a few fiery seconds this morning.

a timetable to balance the budget. 
<HR>

<H3>Bosnia Talks</H3>

<P>
An end to one of Europe's longest and bloodiest conflicts is hanging
in the balance. 
<P>
A U.S.-imposed deadline for the conclusion of a Bosnian peace
conference in Ohio has come and gone, and there's hope a final
agreement has been reached. A senior Balkan official said negotiations

<HR>

<H3>Agostino -Oath </H3>

<P>
Hamilton East Liberal MPP Dominic Agostino introduced a private
members bill in the legislature today, which would require MPPs
to take an oath to Canada as well as the Queen when being sworn
into office. 
<P>
Last June during a swearing in ceremony, Agostino was stopped
by the Clerk of the House from taking an oath to Canada, because
it was not part of the parliamentary procedure. 20 days later,
the Hamilton MPP was allowed to take two separate oaths, one to
the Queen and one to Canada.. which allowed him to take his seat
in the legislature. 
<P>
Today Agostino brought in a bill which would require all MPPs
to take an oath to Canada, when being sworn to office. Agostino
says he expects his bill to pass since he has assurances that
Premier Mike Harris will support it. 
<HR>

<H3>Diana Invu.</H3>

<H3>Porn Bust</H3>

<P>
It's the computer crime of the 90's. Pornography on the Internet.
Buy, sell, trade, or copy ... criminals are dealing in images
so graphic; and so hard to trace, that enforcing the laws in Canada,
may be virtually impossible. 
<P>
Scot Urquhart reports: 
<P>
<I>According to police; this is a new cottage industry. Lucrative,
and highly illegal.</I>
<P>
<I>The Internet has opened a new highway to those dealing in pornography.
This evidence was seized from a Brantford apartment building;
where police found photographs, video-tapes, VCR's used to make
copies ... and some 35-thousand computer files, loaded with everything,
from child pornography ... to scenes of urination and defecation.
</I>
<P>
<I>They arrested 44 year old Steven Bonner of Brantford, and in
a subsequent raid; found additional material stacked in a Burlington
storage locker. </I>
<P>
<I>While they won't say exactly what their suspect was doing;
they will admit, he profited, by doing it: but the toughest part
for police; is getting at the crime itself: this bust, is only
the third case involving computer technology. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Clinton Gayle Trial</H3>

<P>
The family of Toronto police Constable Todd Baylis cried in court
today as a crown attorney described the &quot;hot, humid night&quot;
in June 1994 when he was killed in a gunfight. 
<P>
Paul Culver delivered the description in his opening statement
at the trial of 26-year- old Clinton Gayle, who pleaded not guilty
to first- degree murder in the death of Baylis. 
<P>
Gayle also pleaded not guilty of attempted murder in the shooting
of Baylis's partner, Constable Mike Leone at a North York housing
complex. 
<P>
About 100 people, including many police officers, packed the courtroom
on the trial's first day. 
<HR>

<H3>House Blast Recut</H3>

<P>
Police believe an explosive device, likely a pipe bomb, caused
an overnight blast that killed a 13-year-old boy in the bedroom
of his north London home. 
<P>
The victim has been identified as Marco Antonio Eloio. 
<P>
Neighbors say &quot;all hell broke loose&quot; following the blast
late last night. Eloio's mother, father and sister were home at
the time, but weren't seriously hurt.
<HR>

<H3>OFL Advance</H3>

<P>
The Ontario Federation of Labor says a grassroots movement is
building against the Mike Harris government. 
<P>
This despite a public opinion poll giving the Tories a 58 percent
approval rating ... up 13-percent since they were elected. 
<HR>

<H3>Workfare-Legislation</H3>

<P>
It took a while, but the Harris government has finally released
details of its promised Workfare program. 
<P>
But the government will throw the responsibility of actually finding
work for welfare recipients back to Ontario's communities. And
as Marci Ien reports, that caused some fireworks in the Ontario
Legislature today. 
<P>
<I>Since Ontario welfare rates were cut almost 22 per cent ...the
backlash against the Harris government has been fast and furious.
</I>
<P>
<I>650-thousand people saw their cheques slashed. And social activists
called the move an attack on the most vulnerable, and 12 welfare
recipients went a step further. They took the Harris government
to court over the cuts...arguing they violated the Canadian charter
of rights. </I>
<P>
<I>Another criticism from advocates of the poor...the so called
&quot;Workfare&quot; and &quot;Learnfare&quot; programs in the
Tories common sense revolution ... that have not yet been implemented.
Activists say the Tories wasted no time cutting rates, but are
taking their time starting up programs that can help the poor
cope. </I>
<P>
<I>But today ...word from Social Services Minister David Tsubouchi.
He says the government hopes to launch Workfare next year...but
he'll be relying on municipalities, service clubs, and businesses
to make the program work. That means service groups like Rotary
and Kiwanis clubs could be responsible for calling a central government
office to request workers. And if those called don't show up for
duty they'll be cut off welfare roles. </I>
<P>
<I>It's not yet known how many jobs will be provided through workfare.

<H3>Ozone Machine </H3>

<P>
Can't get rid of that smoky smell from your home or business.
cooking smells got you down...? has your dog been skunked? 
<P>
Well put down the tomato juice, there's new technology to get
rid of those odors, and as Jamie west reports...it's effective
and affordable... 
<P>
<I>Darrell Hibbard a man who has studied environmental pollution
for 20 years is only too happy to exhort the virtues of ozone
and his new company Airperfect. </I>
<P>
<I>After all he's counting on it to get rich. He's talking about
this ozone generator...a treasure he discovered in a manufacturer's
warehouse in Ozark, Missouri. </I>
<P>
<I>Today at TJ's Restaurant the machine will pump highly concentrated
ozone into a room fetid with cigarette smoke and cooking odors,
instantly killing, not masking the airborne bacteria that cause
the offensive odors. Besides being the element that NASA says
the atmosphere doesn't have enough of... ozone is electrified
oxygen...you can smell it around photocopiers, electric motors
and laser printers... the three thousand dollar machine takes
oxygen from the air, in one chamber ...concentrates it till it's
94 percent pure... </I>
<P>
<I>The technology has dozens of potential applications. smoke
damaged homes. Hospital operating rooms... estimated cost to do
a whole house a reasonable 300 hundred dollars... Right now Darrell
is the only one in Canada with this machine but he hopes to sell
Airperfect franchises across Canada in the near future. </I>

<H3>Obscenity Decision</H3>

<P>
The head of Canada's biggest adult video chain is thrilled with
a Supreme Court ruling today that acquits him of selling obscene
material. 
<P>
Randy Jorgenson was charged after Toronto police purchased the
tapes in a Toronto store. 
<P>
<I>When the Adult Only videos were sold to undercover cops, they
had already been viewed and approved by the Ontario censor board.
And in today's ruling the Supreme Court tossed out the conviction
saying there was no proof Jorgenson knew the videos contained
obscene material. </I>
<P>
<I>The Kitchener man who runs the chain of Adults Only stores
says the decision makes the ruling on adult videos clear. (If
police seize tapes to determine if there obscene, they should
check with the Ontario censor board.) </I>
<P>
<I>But in Toronto the Minister of Consumer and Commercial Affairs
says the Censor Board is still valid and that Jorgenson is a man
who pushes the boundaries. Jorgenson says the Supreme Court ruling
is clear in saying there is a process for films to go through
with the Censor Board, and that society doesn't want video store
owners themselves to determine what is and isn't obscene. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton Kathy Renwald Channel 11 News,</I>
<HR>

<H3>Bernardo/House</H3>

<P>
The St. Catharines house where Paul Bernardo raped and killed
two teenage girls could be torn down within the next couple of
days.
<P>
Attorney General Charles Harnick says it would take as little
as two hours to flatten the house. His ministry is working out
the details with St. Catharines police and city officials. 
<P>
A local construction firm has offered to provide the wrecking
ball for free. 
<HR>

<H3>Bernardo-Prison</H3>

<P>
Meanwhile... a published report says that Bernardo is living in
fear for his life at the Kingston Penitentiary. 
<P>
The Toronto Sun says prisoners at the facility have threatened
to kill him. Inmate sources are quoted as saying Bernardo is so
shaken that he has refused to take daily showers and exercise,
except on one occasion. 
<P>
He was convicted in the sex-slayings of teenagers Kristen French
and Leslie Mahaffy and has also been declared a dangerous offender.

<HR>

<H3>Nepal - Canadians</H3>

<P>
At least three Canadians are now reported among the dead after
a freak blizzard in the Himalayas. 
<P>
Officials in Nepal says hundreds of foreign tourists are still
unaccounted for after a series of avalanches and blinding snow.

<P>
Two of the Canadian victims have been identified... Alan Sordi
and Peter Wilson of BC. Another Canadian was rescued today. 
<HR>

<H3>Robbery Shooting</H3>

<P>
Metro Toronto Police are searching for a gunman after the shooting
of a clerk in a Pape- Danforth convenience store during an attempted
robbery just before noon today. 
<P>
The victim is a 57-year-old man. He was shot in the groin. Police
say his injuries are not life-threatening. The victim was alone
in the store when he was shot. 
<HR>

<H3>Gay Acceptance</H3>

<P>
Twenty years ago it was virtually unthinkable. Openly gay and
lesbian politicians, business people, adoptive parents. 
<P>
But the tide has changed, and so too has public acceptance. And
starting today, for the first time ever, gay politicians from
around the world are converging on Toronto for a special conference.

<P>
Marci Ien reports. 
<P>
<I>February 1981 ....Toronto police officers descend on a number
of gay bath houses... windows and doors are smashed. Lockers pried
open. Men forced into the street. </I>
<P>
<I>At the Toronto-based gay newspaper &quot;extra!&quot;...there
is a wall of history... it documents the rage of the gay community
against a system it calls unjust. But the fight for full equality
continues to be put to the test. There are bloody battles... confrontations
with police. </I>
<P>
<I>But much too has changed... now that the face of politics has
changed. There are openly gay politicians like Svend Robinson
and Toronto city councilor Kyle Rae. Rae is also co-chair of an
annual meeting of the international network of gay and lesbian
officials. </I>
<P>
<I>For the first time in 11 years...the conference is being held
in Toronto and has attracted gay politicians from all over the
world. Kyle Rae says the tide is turning ...and there seems to
be a greater acceptance of gays...although he's received his share
of hate mail over the years. </I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Marci Ien, Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Labour Protest </H3>

<P>
A rolling anti- government protest is planned for Sunday. 
<P>
Union members heading to Toronto for next week's Ontario Federation
of Labor Convention will be joining convoys from Windsor, Port
Colborne, Sudbury and Ottawa. Their vehicles will be decked with
anti-government slogans, and each convoy will be carrying a &quot;wall
of shame&quot; detailing the impact of cuts by the Harris government.

<P>
The mock walls will also be featured at a Queen's Park demonstration
on Wednesday. 
<HR>

<H3>Tax Fraud </H3>

<P>
The Harris government is being accused of being tough on welfare
fraud, but soft on tax fraud. 
<P>
Opposition parties at Queens Park today says the government applies
a double standard to different types of fraud. 
<HR>

<H3>Grit Popularity</H3>

<P>
An Angus Reid poll shows the Federal Liberals are as popular as
ever, with 56 per cent of decided support. 
<P>
But two-thirds of those asked could not list a positive accomplishment
by the Chretien government. 
<P>
Reid pollster Darrell Bricker says that reflects the lack of opposition.
He warns Canadians will eventually want proof things have been
done. 
<HR>

<H3>Queen Mum </H3>

<P>
The Queen Mother underwent a successful hip replacement operation
today. 
<P>
Buckingham Palace says the 95-year-old mother of Queen Elizabeth
the second is making a &quot;good recovery.&quot; She's expected
to remain in hospital for a couple of weeks.

<H3>Harris-Watt</H3>

<P>
A former aide to Premier Mike Harris who resigned in disgrace
four months ago, has been hired on a contract basis by Finance
Minister Ernie Eves. 
<P>
Jamie Watt pleaded guilty in 1985 to defrauding 14 Oakville businessmen,
residents and Oakville councilors of 19-thousand dollars. In his
new job, Watt will help develop a communications strategy for
an economic statement to be given by Finance Minister Ernie Eves
at the end of this month. The Premier defended the decision. 
<HR>

<H3>Advocacy Act Dead</H3>

<P>
Health and financial decisions for the mentally incapable will
be returned to the hands of their families, if the Harris government
has its way. 
<P>
A proposed new law was introduced in the legislature today to
replace the former NDP government's &quot;advocacy act&quot;.
That called for government- appointed trustees to make key decisions
for Ontario's most vulnerable. Health Minister Jim Wilson says
it caused bureaucratic chaos. 
<HR>

<H3>Measles Vaccine</H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, the Health Minister says he'll soon announce a program
under which the province will foot the bill for a second measles
vaccination program for Ontario's children. 
<P>
There have been almost 22-hundred cases of measles so far this
year, compared to just 323 in all of last year. The second dose
of vaccine was recommended by Ontario's chief medical health officer.

<HR>

<H3>Harcourt Reax </H3>

<P>
The Premier of British Columbia is quitting. 
<P>
Mike Harcourt announced today he is throwing in the towel. This
after he was unable to shake the political baggage resulting from
the Nanaimo bingo scandal, even though he was cleared by an investigation.

<P>
In Ottawa... BC New Democrat Svend Robinson praised his decision.

<HR>

<H3>Cigarette Bust</H3>

<P>
The RCMP say, they've put an end to a major tobacco smuggling
and money laundering operation. 
<P>
A 21 month, joint forces investigation, has ended with one arrest;
three other suspects charged. Police say the group took Canadian
grown tobacco from Tillsonburg, and shipped it to the US to produce
illegal, duty free cigarettes, which were then smuggled back into
Canada, through Cornwall Ontario, for sale.
<P>
RCMP say many of the cigarettes were sold on the Six Nations Reserve
near Brantford; under the brand names &quot;DK&quot;, and &quot;Putter&quot;.
They estimate the group took a profit of more than 25 million
dollars in three or four years of operation. 
<P>
They have issue warrants for the arrest of 56 year old Peter Montour,
and 34 year old Jerry Montour, both of Hamilton; and Tillsonburg
native, Don Wales. A fourth suspect; 43 year old Dwayne Jocko
of Cornwall will appear in court in Brantford, Friday morning,
for a bail hearing. 
<HR>

<H3>Cops Charged</H3>

<P>
Three mounties and an OPP constable in Cornwall face numerous
charges of theft and possession of stolen property in connection
with property taken from vehicles operated by suspected smugglers.

<P>
This after a seven month joint investigation by the two police
forces. Charged are RCMP constables Marc Belanger, Rock Plouffe
and Serge Lamoureux, and OPP constable Dan Lefebvre. 
<HR>

<H3>Vacuum Scam </H3>

<P>
We've all heard the old adage &quot;let the buyer beware&quot;.

<P>
Tonight, a story that reminds us how important that is. It involves
some women, a vacuum, and a deal they say they were sucked into.
Marci Ien has more. 
<P>
<I>This is the machine Bonnie says she got swindled into buying...a
Kirby vacuum cleaner. </I>
<P>
<I>Bonnie did more than look...she bought the vacuum ...even though
she says she couldn't afford it...forging her ex-husband's signature
to clinch the sale. But ex-Kirby salesman James Taylor says what
happened to Bonnie is just business as usual. </I>
<P>
<I>Back at Bonnie's...Maxine has joined the discussion... she's
a friend of Bonnie's who also says she was pressured into buying
a Kirby vacuum...she returned it...but now has no vacuum at all
because she traded in her old model to get a deal on the new Kirby.
She too says she couldn't afford it...but that the salesperson
convinced her otherwise. </I>
<P>
<I>Later...some good news for Bonnie... a call from Kirby...saying
they'll take the vacuum back. Kirby says they'll pick up Bonnie's
vacuum sometime this week...Maxine says she'll keep trying to
get her old vacuum back. </I>
<P>
<I>Marci Ien, Channel 11 News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Bus Deregulation</H3>

<P>
There's a warning today that dozens of small Ontario communities
could lose their bus service under government deregulation. 
<P>
Transportation Minister Al Palladini wants to see Ontario's Intercity
bus system deregulated. Seniors, students and three unions warn
that will mean bus companies dumping smaller routes in favor of
larger, more profitable ones. 
<HR>

<H3>Palladini-Roads</H3>

<P>
Palladini also vowed to find the money to patch up Ontario's highways.

<P>
He says roads are a necessary part of the provincial economy and
must be maintained. Provincial Auditor Erik Peters says about
60 per cent of Ontario's major roadways are in rough shape. 
<HR>

<H3>Old Man Winter </H3>

<P>
This was not a day for car commuters. 
<P>
Motorists had to contend with icy and slushy roads in many areas
and there were numerous accidents, as old man winter's first big
snow deluge dumped 15 to 20 centimetres on some parts of the province.

<P>
The Niagara peninsula was hit hard and power outages were reported
this morning in Fort Erie, St. Catharines and Niagara-on-the-
Lake. Light snow continued to fall throughout the afternoon, and
it will taper off completely tonight. 
<HR>

<H3>Peninsula Players </H3>

<P>
The Peninsula Players of Smithville is serving up a comedy from
Britain's Ray Cooney...a specialist in farce. 
<P>
The play, running through the weekend, has a cold war setting
in which a Russian ballet dancer wants to defect to our side.

<P>
Cooney keeps the plot stirred with fast paced physical comedy,
as authorities try to prevent the defection. 
<P>
&quot;Chase Me, Comrade!&quot; runs Thursday, Friday and Saturday
at the College Street School in Smithville.

<HR>

<H3>Homolka Evng</H3>

<P>
There was no shortage of angry backlash when the public learned
of Karla Homolka's deal with the crown that got her twelve years
for her role in the deaths of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy.

<P>
In exchange prosecutors got her testimony against her ex- husband
Paul Bernardo at his murder trial last summer. But now that the
trial is over, attorney general Charles Harnick says a former
appeals court judge will review the Homolka deal. 
<P>
The recommendations by justice Patrick Galligan are due march
15th, and the results are to be made public. While Harnick says
he looks forward to the recommendations, the opposition says the
review is far from a full public inquiry. 
<HR>

<H3>auditors report</H3>

<P>
The provincial auditor brought down his annual report on government
spending today. And he says the government is losing millions
of dollars to the underground economy. 
<HR>

<H3>Harass Harris</H3>

<P>
Premier Mike Harris is about to face a less than warm welcome
as he arrives at Mohawk raceway tonight to speak at a 300-dollar-
a-plate Tory fund-raiser. 
<P>
The Ontario Coalition for Social Justice has organized dozens
of demonstrators, to protest the government's hefty cuts to welfare
and other social programs. 
<HR>

<H3>Copps-Spies</H3>

<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps says there will be a review
of procedures at the communications security establishment...
but she's careful not to rule out spying on other countries. 
<P>
Copps says the government wants to make sure the electronic snoopers
are observing the law. 
<HR>

<H3>Tobin - Fish </H3>

<P>
Ottawa is hoping for a five-fold increase in the fees it collects
for commercial fishing licenses. 
<P>
Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin says the government would take
in about 45-million- dollars next year. Tobin wants to set the
new license fees at three per cent of catch value. 
<HR>

<H3>US Gov't Shutdown </H3>

<P>
In the United States... &quot;closed&quot; signs went up today,
literally and figuratively, on many U.S. government operations.

<P>
Budget director Alice Rivlin issued a directive this morning telling
federal departments to close their doors. President Clinton and
congressional republicans have failed to agree on temporary spending
legislation to keep the government operating. 
<HR>

<H3>Julian Lloyd Webber </H3>

<P>
Andrew Lloyd Webber is a high profile composer of musicals about
felines, a deposed dictator, a masked man and a forgotten movie
icon. 
<P>
His brother Julian shares the international spotlight as an acclaimed
classical soloist. 
<P>
Alex Reynolds met with Julian Lloyd Webber as he prepared for
a Toronto concert appearance tonight. 
<P>
<I>Lloyd Webber's instrument is a 300 year old Stradivarius obtained
at an auction a dozen years ago. The cello has been his musical
companion since childhood. </I>
<P>
<I>Lloyd Webber draws inspiration from master cellist Rostropovich...a
full concert schedule leaves little time to perform with his brother.
</I>
<P>
<I>Of great interest to the cellist is music for children. Lloyd
Webber's just released CD of cradle songs is unique.</I>
<P>
<I>Julian Lloyd Webber makes his Toronto recital debut tonight
at the Glenn Gould studio.</I>

<H3>Homolka Invest</H3>

<P>
The Ontario government confirms Karla Homolka's plea-bargain deal
will be reviewed. 
<P>
Premier Mike Harris says the Attorney General will announce the
Judicial Review tomorrow. But the review will be done in secret
and Harris refuses to speculate on what will be involved. He says
the public is concerned about the deal and how it was reached.

<P>
Homolka pleaded guilty to manslaughter and got a 12-year sentence
in exchange for her testimony against Paul Bernardo. He was convicted
of first-degree murder this past summer in the murders of Kristen
French and Leslie Mahaffy. 
<HR>

<H3>Body Found</H3>

<P>
There's no further word just yet on the circumstances surrounding
the death of a woman whose body was discovered last night in a
ditch in Scarborough. 
<P>
Police are treating it as suspicious. Investigators say it looks
as though the woman was killed somewhere else and the body was
dumped near a railroad line. 
<P>
A set of car tracks was found leading to the scene. 
<P>
The Asian woman was about 30 years old. She was wearing blue jeans
and a pink turtleneck sweater. 
<HR>

<H3>Labour - Hamilton </H3>

<P>
We haven't seen anything like it in 50 years. 
<P>
Not since the ford strike at the end of world war two ... has
organized labour called for a general strike that would shut down
a city in Ontario. 
<P>
That call, however, came this afternoon, from the Ontario Federation
of Labour. they have targeted the city of London, for a general
strike, December 11th ... It's a counter-strike against the Tory
government and the controversial Bill Seven, Labour Legislation.
: 
<P>
<I>They've been ignored by the government; and steam-rolled, under
Bill Seven. </I>
<P>
<I>But can a general strike succeed? According to McMaster University
labour analyst Charlotte Yates; labour has to do something significant,
to slow the Tory juggernaut: and if a general strike is successful
in one city, others will follow.</I>
<P>
<I>According to Yates the key is public support, and labour must
broaden its base in order to survive.</I>
<P>
<I>But the Tories, don't seem to be worried about a general strike.
Cabinet Board Manager Dave Johnson says he doesn't think today's
workers will heed the call.  And indeed, Wayne Marston admits,
that those who take part in a general strike will lose not only
their wages, but possibly, their jobs.</I>
<P>
<I>Despite the risk Yates sees an up side, for labour.</I>

<H3>Day Care March </H3>

<P>
Since the Tory government came to power last June, demonstrations
by groups affected by funding cuts have almost become the order
of the day. And today was no exception. Bob Ireland has more in
Toronto. 
<P>
<I>Hundreds of tiny protesters across Metro Toronto demonstrated
with their mothers and day care teachers against government plans
to stop giving subsidies to daycare centres. </I>
<P>
<I>Daycare workers say the Harris government plans to get rid
of daycare completely and working parents who now send their kids
to daycare will be on their own. </I>
<P>
<I>Meanwhile, about 74 children's aid workers and supporters attended
a rally to protest funding cuts of nearly a million dollars this
year. </I>
<P>
<I>Candice Cooke is a welfare mother with two children, who is
trying to go to school. She says Children's Aid has been her only
salvation. </I>
<P>
<I>The one day shutdown saved the Children's' Aid 180-thousand
dollars. But the CAS. says it will lose more than 3-million dollars
next year through government funding cuts. </I>

<H3>CanWest Bid/WIC </H3>

<P>
A new media takeover bid was launched today that could form a
third national television network in Canada. CanWest Global Communications
of Winnipeg is trying to buy WIC Western International Communications
of Vancouver. 
<P>
<I>CanWest Global Communications of Winnipeg is best known for
its Global TV network in Ontario. Although it has other stations
across Canada, it has none of the lucrative TV markets in Alberta
and Quebec. </I>
<P>
<I>CanWest Global is offering 636 million dollars or 24 dollars
a share to buy Western International Communications of Vancouver.
</I>
<P>
<I>Some Bay Street media analysts say that price is too low. CanWest
Global almost has a national television network with stations
in Vancouver Regina, Saskatoon, Winnipeg, Toronto, Halifax and
St. John New Brunswick. Western International has 19 radio and
t-v stations including BCTV in Vancouver and CHCH in Hamilton.
It also is the licensee in western Canada for Superchannel and
MovieMax pay t-v. Western also owns satellite services and a new
technology called Cellularvision, a wireless transmission system.
</I>
<P>
<I>There has been takeover speculation on the Toronto Stock Exchange
of Western being taken over as share prices this year climbed
from 13 dollars to almost 25 dollars a share. Takeover speculation
is fueled by an internal battle on Western's board by two families,
the Griffiths and the Allards. </I>
<P>
<I>A British Columbia court hearing December 11th is expected
to decide if a clause in western's bylaws will allow public class
&quot;B&quot; shares to be changed into voting shares. If that
happens the takeover is more likely. Without that change a takeover
is unlikely because the Griffiths family controls the existing
voting class &quot;A&quot; shares. The Griffiths family has said
in the past that its shares are not for sale. </I>

<H3>Halton Newser</H3>

<P>
Police across southern Ontario fear that another violent serial
rapist may be on the loose. 
<P>
And as Dwight Ryan reports, a task force from three regional police
departments hopes that you can help find the suspect. 
<P>
<I>The reign of terror began in August of 1992 in Kitchener. An
eight year old boy was lured into a wooded park area and violently
assaulted. The suspect was armed with a knife.</I>
<P>
<I>More than two years later, a ten year old boy suffered a similar
fate in a Brampton park. Media representatives were given details
of the assaults. </I>
<P>
<I>But to protect the victims, much of that information is not
for public consumption. Police do know from preliminary DNA evidence
that the same man committed all three offenses... a task force
of officers from Halton, Waterloo and Peel Regional forces has
been formed to track down the suspect. </I>
<P>
<I>Sgt. Joe Martin believes there may be other victims. Police
say the suspect was driving a reddish brown Bronco or Blazer.
</I>
<P>
<I>Oakville resident Charles Lukito believes it was a Bronco.
Lukito will share his information with the task force. </I>
<P>
<I>A 1-800 number will be set up. In the meantime, anyone with
information is asked to call Halton Regional Police at 905-825-4777.
extension 5086. or call Crime Stoppers. </I>
<P>

<HR>

<H3>Tammy Homolka </H3>

<P>
Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy might be alive today if the
body of Tammy Homolka had been examined for sexual assault. 
<P>
That's the suggestion in a report in the Toronto Star that said
certain investigators insisted on looking for sexual assault.
But those tests were never done. 
<P>
Lauran Sabourin has this report.
<P>
<I>Police were called to the Homolka house in the early morning
hours of December 24th, 1990. They found Tammy Homolka lying on
the floor in a basement bedroom. She was unconscious. A large
burn like mark covered one side of her face. </I>
<P>
<I>Constable David Weeks the first officer on the scene said that
mark was suspicious. He questioned why Karla Homolka was trying
to wash Tammy's vomit stained blanket. And why if they had finished
watching videos as Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka had told them
the video still in the VCR was stopped halfway through. </I>
<P>
<I>In a written statement to police Paul Bernardo said he and
Homolka were awakened by Tammy choking. She had consumed alcohol
that night. They suggested that she had choked on her own vomit.
Looking at the fact that it was close to Christmas, Tammy did
have a lot to drink, and Bernard and Homolka appeared to be extremely
upset investigators did not believe any foul play was involved.
</I>
<P>
<I>But, Homolka and Bernardo told a different story at their trials.
They testified they planned to sexually assault Tammy that night.
They plied with a dangerous concoction of alcohol and sleeping
pills. And then put an anesthetic to her face. She started choking.
Homolka and Bernardo started to panic. Tammy died a short time
later in hospital. </I>
<P>
<I>A police identification officer is reported to have asked that
Tammy be tested for sexual assault. Pathologist Dr. John Groves
conducted the autopsy. Those tests for sexual assault were never
done. It was only after Karla Homolka admitted that she caused
her sister's death. And after Tammy's remains were exhumed and
second autopsy done that the halcyon sleeping pills were discovered.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Welfare-Court</H3>

<P>
An Ontario government lawyer urged three judges today not to meddle
with massive welfare cuts, saying they can't erase poverty by
&quot;making it unconstitutional.&quot;
<P>
Lawyer Janet Minor says the rates implemented earlier this fall
are not as draconian as critics claim and are about the same as
what recipients received in 1985, taking inflation into account.

<P>
A group of welfare claimants is asking the court to overturn the
conservative government's recent 21.6 per cent cut to welfare
rates. 
<HR>

<H3>Poverty Experience </H3>

<P>
Being on welfare is not an easy lot. Seven people from of various
economic means found that out after living on a welfare budget
for the past week. 
<HR>

<H3>Labor Law </H3>

<P>
Strikebreakers are now legal in Ontario. 
<P>
Lieutenant Governor Hal Jackman signed the Harris government's
Bill 7 into law this afternoon. That means the use of replacement
workers during strikes and lockouts is legal again in Ontario.

<P>
The legislation was supported by business but opposed by unions
and brings an end to labor law reforms passed three year ago by
the former NDP government. The law also makes it tougher for unions
to sign up new members. 
<HR>

<H3>Chretien-RCMP</H3>

<P>
The mounties have suspended four officers on guard the night an
armed intruder broke into the Prime Minister's official residence.

<P>
It took six or seven minutes before RCMP officers responded to
a call for help from Chretien's wife Aline. Three RCMP supervisors
have been reassigned. We'll have full details on Canada tonight
at 6:30 
<HR>

<H3>Tobin Copps</H3>

<P>
A number of international organizations continue to rank Canada
as one of the best countries in the world, but Canadians too often
forget. 
<P>
That was the message from Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin during
a whistle stop dinner speech in Hamilton last night.

<H3>PCB's Smithville</H3>

<P>
We begin tonight with the story of how a toxic waste dumping ground
in Smithville is evolving into a working laboratory, in the quest
for permanent containment and disposal methods for the deadly
toxins... notably PCB's. 
<P>
The site ... the size of a football field... is permeated with
polychlorinated biphenyls... so much so that extraction and treatment
would take four millennia to complete. 
<P>
Channel 11's Lauran Sabourin visited the site... 
<P>
<I>It's a filthy job. A layer of mud covers everything. </I>
<P>
<I>This is one of sites being drilled in the latest phase of a
project to clean up the old PCB storage site in Smithville. </I>
<P>
<I>One of the worst PCB contaminated sites in Ontario. The province
has cleaned up the PCB's on and near the surface but there's still
130 thousand lights of PCB oil sitting underground. </I>
<P>
<I>It's a football field size.... Ted O'neill is the project manager
of the Remediation Program in Smithville. </I>
<P>
<I>His team is drilling holes around the site to see how deep
the PCB's have seeped. </I>
<P>
<I>It goes top to bottom.... in an effort to stop the spreading
of the PCB oil there is a system of pumping and treating the toxins.</I>
<P>
<I>The problem with that.... so slow that under the pump and treat
process it would take four thousand years to get the PCB's out
of the ground. </I>
<P>
<I>This drilling project is intended to put a long term containment
system in to hold the PCB oils in place. </I>
<P>
<I>One of the problems.... the ground water is tested everyday
to be sure poisons aren't' getting into the water supply. </I>
<P>
<I>Once the PCB's are safely contained there's a still a larger
hurdle to jump. There are no technologies known to get the PCB's
out of the ground. What will happen is that Smithville will become
a testing ground. A site for scientists that have developed possible
technologies to test their product. </I>
<P>
<I>In the end it's hoped the PCB's will out of ground. Safely
destroyed. And new technologies will be in place to rid other
toxic dumpsites of PCBs' in Smithville.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Tuna Protest</H3>

<P>
There was another demonstration at Queen's Park today... and once
again it was in protest against major welfare payment cutbacks
by the Harris administration. 
<P>
Anti poverty and religious groups from across the province joined
together in this latest expression of outrage. 
<HR>

<H3>Peace Torches</H3>

<P>
Veterans representing every province and territory met on parliament
hill today, each with a &quot;torch of peace&quot; that they carried
from home. 
<P>
Last weekend, communities across the country participated in their
own dedication ceremonies, where each peace torch was first presented.

<P>
Today, the flames were joined in a single, national &quot;torch
of peace&quot;, passed on to defence and Veterans' Affairs Minister
David Collenette. 
<P>
This event marks the fiftieth anniversary of the ratification
of the united nations charter by parliament... and it symbolizes
the passing on of the quest for peace from war veterans to the
United Nations and its peacekeepers.
<HR>

<H3>Holocaust Ceremony </H3>

<P>
The end of the holocaust has been commemorated on a stamp. 
<P>
Canada Post issued the stamp today, which is the 50th anniversary
of the day the horror inflicted on European Jews ended. 
<P>
It is also the anniversary of &quot;kristallnacht&quot; or &quot;night
of the broken glass&quot;... the night in 1938 when German Jews
were rounded up, as Nazis laid waste to their synagogues and property.

<P>
Surviving victims were honored as the stamp was unveiled. It shows
a photo collage of faces, representing holocaust victims, as well
as other symbols of persecution. 
<HR>

<H3>Caledonia Tourism</H3>

<P>
It was once a vital community on the old plank road that linked
Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. And the Town of Caledonia has plans
to build on its historic past. 
<P>
As Kathy Renwald reports, tourists are finding a reason to stop
and linger in the rivertown. 
<P>
<I>At one end of town a solitary fisherman spends a frosty morning
in the grand river...across the water in Caledonia its Victorian
tea time at the heritage center in the old town hall. </I>
<P>
<I>Tickets for tea sold out in one hour flat. Caledonia is counting
on its history and geography to capture the tourist trade. </I>
<P>
<I>Gayle Hagan is talking about the annual Christmas Open House
Tour. She and her partner in the home and hearth started the idea.
Now its embraced by merchants convinced there on to a good thing.
</I>
<P>
<I>The Haldimand House finished part one of their restoration
in time for the tour. </I>
<P>
<I>Inside Chris Leosis shows off tin work dating back to 1842.
He has far reaching plans for the building which dwarfs the original
family business. </I>
<P>
<I>Jones Bakery has been a fixture since 1904 on the old plank
road as it was know. Inside its evident the family never strayed
far from their roots. </I>
<P>
<I>With shiny windows full of gifts merchants see a downtown on
the upswing. there are hopes to make the old mill a showpiece
of history. But at the Victorian tea talk takes a cautious turn.
But others see opportunity in Caledonia's rural setting with its
mix of history and hominess. </I>
<P>
<I>In Caledonia Kathy Renwald Channel 11 News.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Barrie Snow</H3>

<P>
Barrie has been hit with 20 centimeters of snow... just as snowplow
operators in the area are being given their lay-off notices ...
part of Harris government cutbacks. 
<P>
And there were at least 20 accidents along a snowy stretch of
highway 400 south of Barrie yesterday. A tractor-trailer rolled
over into a ditch in one mishap. Barrie and an area around the
lake Huron communities of Kincardine and Goderich, bore the brunt
of the snow squalls.
<HR>

<H3>Shaw Records</H3>

<P>
The Shaw festival in Niagara-on- the-Lake set records for attendance
and ticket sales this year. 
<P>
The festival, featuring dramatic works by George Bernard Shaw
and his contemporaries, drew 290-thousand people to 739 performances.
The old record was about 278- thousand people, set last year.

<P>
Ticket sales for the Shaw's 34th season topped more than nine-million
dollars to break the record of 8.1-million dollars in 1994.

<H3>Regional Power Grab</H3>

<P>
It is an unprecedented power grab. And if it's adopted by the
province, it would whittle away the powers of Ontario school boards
and municipal councils, and invest them instead in super regional
governments.
<P>
It is a report, signed by the heads of thirteen Ontario county
and regional governments. And it has been forwarded to premier
mike Harris, in anticipation of provincial plans to radically
restructure local government in Ontario.
<P>
Deborah walker reports. 
<P>
<I>Ontario's Regional Chairmen and their top bureaucrats have
been working on the report for more than a year. They claim to
represent two-thirds of the population of the province, even though
most of them are elected by their own council, not by voters.
</I>
<P>
<I>Terry Cooke is one of only two Regional Chairmen elected at
large, and he makes no apologies for signing the report, since
he campaigned for one-tier government.</I>
<P>
<I>Even so, the Regional Chairmen have enraged fellow politicians
by sending the report to Queen's Park, without bothering to consult
their own councils.</I>
<P>
<I>Specifically, the report calls on the province to wipe out
local Municipal Governments wherever possible, and to keep them
only if geography or population warrant it.</I>
<P>
<I>Even if local councils stay, the report says they should operate
with severely diminished responsibilities.</I>
<P>
<I>As one Niagara councilor put it, the only thing they'd be left
in charge of is cemeteries and dog-catching. </I>
<P>
<I>The report suggests region's take over fire protection, transit,
water, waste and sewer systems, economic development and major
planning. local municipalities would only be responsible for things
like secondary planning, libraries, parks and museums, licensing
and weed control. And Regional Chairmen are not content to stop
at stripping away the powers of municipal governments.</I>
<P>
<I>They're also eyeing duties now performed by Hydro commissions,
police commissions, even school boards.</I>
<P>
<I>The Regional Chairmen's report was precipitated by the Ontario
Tories' campaign promise to revamp local government in time for
the next municipal election. It will no doubt be followed by a
flurry of reports from city and town councils, school boards and
commissions making it clear their own visions of local government
reform do not coincide with those of the Regional Chairmen. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton, Deborah walker, Channel Eleven News.</I>

<H3>Croatian Guns </H3>

<P>
Provincial police in Markdale, just east of Owen Sound, have stumbled
on a sizable cache of guns and ammunition. And they say the artillery
was Croatia-bound.
<HR>

<H3>Bernardo-prison</H3>

<P>
Convicted murderer Paul Bernardo moved into his new home at Kingston
Penitentiary today. 
<P>
Members of the Niagara and Toronto police forces escorted the
31-year-old murderer and rapist from a Toronto jail.
<P>
Bernardo was declared a dangerous offender last Friday and will

<H3>Welfare Court-2</H3>

<P>
A Toronto court has been told the Harris government made an ill-informed
decision in slashing welfare rates far below the national average.
<P>
Those claims were made today by a lawyer representing 12 welfare
recipients who are challenging the 22 per cent cuts in benefits
made by cabinet order last summer.
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts to force the government to hand over a secret
cabinet document discussing the cuts, have been shot down.
<P>
Marci Ien reports. 
<P>
<I>Lawyers representing the 12 had asked a panel of judges to
order the Ontario cabinet to release a secret document discussing
the cuts.</I>
<P>
<I>But a Toronto judge has turned downed the request. Following
the ruling, lawyers for the welfare recipients proceeded with
their main arguments for stopping the cuts. ...Citing that after
the cuts ...a single person on social assistance living in metro
Toronto now receives 520 dollars a month. After paying an average
of 517 dollars in rent ...there's 3 dollars left for food and
clothing.</I>
<P>
<I>And here's another scenario: shown in court... a single parent
with one child like claimant Toni Panzuto now receives 957 dollars
a month. After paying rent for a one-bedroom apartment... there'
316 dollars left over.</I>
<P>
<I>A couple with two children living in a 3-bedroom apartment
would have 280 dollars to spare. </I>
<P>
<I>Lawyers and advocates for the welfare recipients say it's simply
not adequate to meet basic needs of food shelter, and clothing.
</I>
<P>
<I>The landmark court case continues throughout this week. </I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Marci Ien, Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Abductee Rescued</H3>

<P>
A man who spent the night in the trunk of a car after he was abducted
was freed today by police and firefighters in Toronto. 
<P>
This after a woman walking her dog heard his cries for help coming
from a vehicle in an east end Toronto parking lot. The man told
police he had been robbed and abducted at gunpoint last night
outside a Scarborough fast food restaurant. 
<HR>

<H3>Drowned Baby</H3>

<P>
A Toronto couple whose baby died after being left in a bathtub
will serve time in jail.
<P>
Christopher Matthews was sentenced this morning to six-months
in jail. His wife, Robin Bois, received 60 days, to be served
on weekends.
<P>
Court was told the couple had left their seven-month-old son in
a bathtub seat while they watched television. They later discovered
that he had drowned. 
<P>
The 33-year-old Matthews was found guilty last month of criminal
negligence causing death. Bois, who is 21, was convicted of the
lesser charge of child abandonment. 
<HR>

<H3>Ottawa Clip</H3>

<P>
Ottawa has taken its first step toward plans for changing Canadian
federalism... and recognizing Quebec as a distinct society.
<P>
A special meeting of the federal cabinet has already been struck...
and Ottawa hopes to have its blueprint for change in place by
Christmas. 
<HR>

<H3>Chamber-GTA</H3>

<P>
The Metro Toronto Board of Trade is calling on the provincial
government to do away with regional governments in the greater
Toronto area and replace it with one political authority.
<P>
The aim is to have uniform property tax rates from Burlington
to Oshawa. 
<HR>

<H3>Fair Opens</H3>

<P>
For the 67th time, the Royal Winter Fair opened at the Coliseum
at Exhibition Place today. 
<P>
This year's celebration of rural life in the big city features
superdogs and super-sized vegetables. also on the slate.... the
RCMP musical ride and a display of permaculture... a type of ecological
gardening.
<P>
Visitors can also take in the traditional giant vegetable competitions,
horse shows and livestock shows. 
<P>
The royal runs until November 18th. 
<HR>

<H3>Basketball Home </H3>

<P>
The hoopla of pro basketball has finally come to Canada... but
the glitzy game we now see on the court had very humble beginnings.
<P>
The inventor of basketball, Dr. James Naismith, was Canadian...
born and raised in a small town just outside Ottawa. 
<HR>

<H3>Blowed Up Real Good</H3>

<P>
A Las Vegas white elephant was reduced to a pile of rubble at
dawn today in a noisy implosion that served as a wake-up call
for thousands of people in nearby hotels.
<P>
It was over in seconds. But back in 1968 the 31-storey landmark
hotel was a new and shining example of futuristic- style building.
<P>
Over the years, it fell victim to stiff competition, never turning
a profit. 7,000 people turned out to witness the structure's demise.

<H3>Break-In</H3>

<P>
The man accused of breaking into the Prime Minister's official
residence over the weekend armed with a knife has now been charged
with attempted murder.
<P>
34-year-old Andr&eacute; Dallaire of Montreal appeared in court
in Ottawa today after undergoing two psychiatric assessments.
He is also charged with break and enter, being unlawfully in a
dwelling, and possession of a weapon. 
<P>
The mounties have launched an investigation into the major breach
of security, that allowed a man to get to the door of the Prime
Minister's bedroom...with no one trying to stop him. 
<P>
The RCMP is red-faced 
<HR>

<H3>Rabin Funeral</H3>

<P>
As a result of all of the weekend excitement at 24 Sussex Drive,
Prime Minister Chretien was pale and tired-looking as he attended
today's funeral for slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
in Jerusalem.
<P>
Chretien was not scheduled to speak at the service and made no
comments to reporters afterward.
<P>
But Rabin was surrounded by world leaders, family, friends and
former enemies as he was laid to rest.
<P>
In her eulogy, Rabin's tearful granddaughter referred to him as
her &quot;private hero.&quot; 
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein called him &quot;a soldier for peace.&quot;

<HR>

<H3>Welfare Court </H3>

<P>
Lawyers representing 12 welfare recipients fought to get their
hands on a secret cabinet document they say may reveal new facts
about Ontario's massive welfare cuts.
<P>
The social assistance claimants are urging the courts to overturn
the 1-billion in cuts and they argue the 35-page document is key
to their case.
<P>
Marci Ien reports from Toronto. 
<P>
<I>A secret cabinet document was the focus of much legal wrangling
in what has become a landmark case in Ontario.</I>
<P>
<I>Lawyers for 12 welfare recipients who want to overturn Ontario's
cut to social assistance asked a court to force the government
to turn the document over.</I>
<P>
<I>Lawyer Mary Eberts says the document is important because the
cuts were made by cabinet order without public debate.</I>
<P>
<I>She told a three-judge panel ... &quot;we are asking that you
not be left in a factual vacuum where the best evidence is left
from the record. But a three-judge panel did agree to hear full
arguments in the case. In an affidavit filed in court, cabinet
secretary Rita Burak said the secret document details the purposes
of the cuts, various options and an analysis of the issues involved.</I>
<P>
<I>It was submitted to cabinet at a July 19th meeting--just two
days before the government announced welfare rates would be slashed
by 22 percent.</I>
<P>
<I>But in her affidavit Burak also says any disclosure of the
document would &quot;severely prejudice&quot; cabinet's ability
to govern.</I>
<P>
<I>Meanwhile, the claimants say they have a right in wrangling
...the claimants say they have a right to have their basic needs
met under the charter of rights.</I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Marci Ien, Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Hospital Cuts </H3>

<P>
Former Conservative Prime Minister Joe Clark is urging provincial
governments to keep in mind the national principles of medi-care
when making cuts to their own health care budgets.
<P>
Clarks' words come in the wake of a public opinion poll that shows
most Ontarians don't support health care cuts. 
<HR>

<H3>Skyway Inquest Wrap</H3>

<P>
A coroners inquest in St. Catharines today came up with 37 recommendations
intended to prevent a tragedy similar to the one that killed four
men working on the Garden City Skyway two years ago.
<P>
The men plunged to their deaths after a suspended platform they
were working on gave way and crashed to the ground.
<P>
Lauran Sabourin has the details in this report.
<P>
<I>More than half of the recommendations are targeted at the Ministry
of Labour.</I>
<P>
<I>The government body the victims families feel is in large part
responsible for the tragedy. A tragedy that unfolded on the afternoon
of June eighth 1993.</I>
<P>
<I>A carpenters work crew was moving a suspended platform along
a track underneath the Garden City Skyway when it became jammed.
While a crewman was trying to get it unjammed. The platform started
to roll. and suspensions holding it snapped. Four men fell to
their deaths. Five others were rescued while clinging to the bridge
for more than an hour.</I>
<P>
<I>One of men who died is Douglas Shand. His then common law wife
Christine Lea feels the Ministry of Labour is to blame.</I>
<P>
<I>While a coroners inquest makes no finding of guilt, it does
answer questions as to how the accident happened. Marilyn Stenzel
lost her husband Conrad in the accident. She's attended the inquest
every day for the last four weeks.</I>
<P>
<I>While the families point to design flaws and lax government
regulations testimony at this inquest revealed that the four men
who died has some quantity of marijuana in their systems.</I>
<P>
<I>In the end the coroners jury came up with 37 recommendations
to improve safety. They included devising a fall arrest system.
Changes to procedures should not be altered without approval.</I>
<P>
<I>The Ministry of Labour should critically review new scaffolding.
There should be emphasis on the dangers of operating equipment
under the influence of alcohol of drugs. </I>
<P>
<I>Inspectors should be trained to recognize drug use on the job
site works should be advised of the risks on the job. And workers
should report any or all operating problems to the contractor.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Trudeau Clips </H3>

<P>
Pierre Trudeau has finally spoken out about the Quebec referendum.

<P>
The former Prime Minister says he sat on his hands during the
Quebec referendum campaign because the no side never asked him
to join the campaign. And he thinks the basic federal strategy
was working until the last two weeks of the campaign. That's when
Trudeau claims Lucien Bouchard started telling lies. 
<HR>

<H3>Clark-Quebec </H3>

<P>
and Joe Clark is urging the Federal Government and the other nine
provinces to recognize Quebec as a distinct society. 
<P>
Clark, was speaking to an Ontario Hospital Association Convention
in Toronto today. He said last week's referendum proved that the
rest of Canada cannot face down Quebec nationalism, and expect
it to disappear. 
<HR>

<H3>Bank Clip </H3>

<P>
There was a vote of confidence for tough government deficit reduction
measures from Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen today.
<P>
He says the economy is looking up... and predicted strong economic
growth for the rest of the year.

<H3>Bernardo Evng</H3>

<P>
Paul Bernardo will spend the rest of his natural life behind bars
if Justice Patrick Lesage has his way.
<P>
The judge declared Bernardo a dangerous offender today and said
that there was likely no chance he'd ever be reformed or treated.
<P>
Bernardo admitted to sexual assault on Tammy Homolka as well as
numerous outstanding rape charges. Those rape victims were all
in court to hear the decision.
<HR>

<H3>Banks-Evng/Live</H3>

<P>
There has been a tragic ending to the abduction of two Hamilton
children by their estranged father. 
<P>
Today, police discovered the bodies 9-year-old Katie Banks, her
7-year-old brother, Danny Banks and their 37-year-old father,
Eugene, found in an Ancaster storage unit. 
<HR>

<H3>Forced Off Welfare</H3>

<P>
The Provincial Government says it's the most dramatic Welfare
decline in more than two decades.
<P>
More than 36-thousand people dropped off Ontario Welfare rolls
last month after benefits were slashed and eligibility rules tightened.

<P>
As Marci Ien reports tonight, critics say the poor are being forced
off Welfare so the province can balance its books. 
<P>
<I>Eligibility rules have been tightened and benefits slashed
but more than 36-thousand people have dropped off Ontario welfare
rolls. </I>
<P>
<I>Sue Cox says Wayne is not alone...the phones are busier than
ever...and the food bank has seen a 70 per cent user increase.
The problem... say poverty activists...is that the government
is unfairly targeting the poor in its fervor to slash the budget.</I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Marci Ien , Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Budget Gripes</H3>

<P>
A social policy group says government spending cuts are to blame
for Canada's economic downturn over the past year. 
<P>
The report released today by the Alternative Federal Budget process
says cuts in February's budget have accounted for 48- percent
of the decline in the GDP in the second quarter of this year...
which it says has slowed down deficit reduction and job creation.

<HR>

<H3>Child Care Credit</H3>

<P>
There may be a glimmer of hope for parents worried about losing
affordable daycare because of provincial cuts. 
<P>
Ottawa has proposed a cost-sharing plan for child-care in order
to keep a Liberal promise to crate thousand of child-care spaces
across Canada. Officials in Ottawa say they are working to arrange
an early meeting between Social Services Minister David Tsubouchi
and Federal Human Resources Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
<P>
Meanwhile, at Queen's Park today the Coalition for Better Daycare
steps up opposition to a new day-care system proposed by the province.
Under the plan daycare subsidies would be ended and replaced with
a voucher system. 
<P>
But these parents say the system works the way it is. 
<HR>

<H3>Quebec Cabinet</H3>

<P>
Bernard Landry is no longer responsible for Immigrants and Cultural
Communities. 
<P>
He had the portfolio taken away from him today in a Quebec cabinet
shuffle. Landry was accused of launching an angry tirade against
immigrants after this week's referendum loss.  He denies the accusations.

<P>
But that incident along with a few other things is fueling Ottawa's
ongoing unity campaign.
<HR>

<H3>Concert Canceled</H3>

<P>
A concert by Quebec folk singer Gilles Vigneault scheduled for
Sudbury next week has been canceled. 
<P>
Several of the Francophone groups promoting the event say they
received threats that the concert by the high profile separatist
would be interrupted by demonstrations. 
<P>
Organizer Norman Roy says even some Francophones called to tell
them they had made a bad choice.
<HR>

<H3>Labor Strategy </H3>

<P>
Union leaders in Ontario are planning to &quot;shut down&quot;
an unnamed city sometime before Christmas to protest the Conservative
government's changes to labor laws, welfare rates and spending
cuts. 
<P>
The president of the Ontario Federation of Labor met with about
40 union leaders in Toronto today. Gord Wilson says the target
city will be selected by a steering committee of eight union leaders
who will co-ordinate plans for demonstrations and other events
that will cause employers &quot;discomfort.&quot; 
<HR>

<H3>David </H3>

<P>
What is art? That's the question asked over the last few days
in Erie since a woman unveiled her 8-foot painting depicting Michelangelo's
&quot;David.&quot; 
<P>
The painting was done on the side of Marilyn Askey's home on plum
street for all her neighbors to see. But some are offended by
the nudity of Askey's recreation, adding their children don't
need to be exposed to the full frontal nudity of the mural.

<H3>Bloc Clip</H3>

<P>
The Bloc is in Ottawa to stay. Bloc Quebecois leader Lucien Bouchard
says his party will keep its seats in parliament as a springboard
from which to fight for Quebec separation... but his own future
remains up in the air. 
<P>
He says he might quit politics altogether, and he'll announce
his decision one way or the other later this month. 
<HR>

<H3>Presto-Change-O </H3>

<P>
Even so, some members of the bloc may throw in the towel, and
that has the Reform Party salivating over the prospect of becoming
the official opposition. 
<P>
Its leader... Preston manning... was on the rubber chicken circuit
in London, Ontario, today, accusing Prime Minister Chretien of
playing into the hands of Quebec separatists. Speaking to a Canadian
Club luncheon he criticized Chretien's plans to offer Quebec distinct
society status and a veto over constitutional change. And he said
that giving Quebec special constitutional status would cause division
across the country because it ignores the equality of the provinces.

<HR>

<H3>PQ Minister Quits </H3>

<P>
A Quebec cabinet minister who was instrumental in the Parti Quebecois
referendum strategy has resigned from the PQ cabinet. 
<P>
Richard Le Hir announced his resignation in a letter to premier
Jacques Parizeau. Le Hir says he'll decide later whether he'll
remain as a member of the National Assembly. As Minister of Restructuring,
he was responsible for about 40 controversial studies on the costs
of Sovereignty. He says he is resigning because the referendum
is over.

<H3>Snobelen - Gr. 13</H3>

<P>
Grade 13 will soon become a thing of the past in Ontario high
schools.

<H3>Women's Cuts </H3>

<P>
Social activists say women's services and the poor continue to
bear the brunt of the Tory ax. 
<P>
An association representing 67 frontline emergency centres for
abused women and their children has lost it's provincial funding.
This as wife assault prevention month gets underway in Ontario.
Marci Ien reports.
<P>
<I>It has been one month since social assistance rates were slashed
by 30 per cent. The Tory government continues to say the cuts
will get people out of the welfare cycle and into jobs. But talk
to Ontario's poor and those that represent them and the scenario
is different. </I>
<P>
<I>The Ontario social safety network is a coalition of anti-poverty
groups. The network is backing 12 welfare recipients who will
challenge the cuts in court next Monday. </I>
<P>
<I>Single mom Bonny Atkins is one of the claimants. She says she
fled an abusive relationship and can hardly make ends meet. </I>
<P>
<I>Eileen Morrow says a lack of money and women's shelters could
force women to stay in abusive situations. Morrow works for the
Ontario Association of Interval and Transition Houses ...an organization
which will lose all of its provincial funding support next year.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Ipperwash Arrests </H3>

<P>
Six natives wanted in connection with the standoff at Ontario's
Ipperwash Park have surrendered to police. 
<P>
Five are accused of minor offenses. But the sixth, 24-year-old
Abraham David George, is charged with assaulting a police officer
and possession of a dangerous weapon. 
<P>
Natives took over the park last summer, claiming it was on sacred
ground. 
<HR>

<H3>Etobicoke Fire </H3>

<P>
A Toronto woman and her young daughter were killed last night
in a fire in an Etobicoke apartment building. 
<P>
Thirty- year-old Constance Samuels and her two-year- old daughter
Desarae died after flames erupted in their apartment in a high-rise
in the 4-0-1 and Martingrove Road area. 
<P>
It's believed the blaze started in a mattress. 
<HR>

<H3>Caledon Accident</H3>

<P>
Rain and fog may have contributed to a collision between a bus
and gravel truck in Caledon last night.
<P>
Two-dozen people were injured... four of them seriously. 
<P>
Part of the side of the Pacific Western Coachways bus was torn
off when it skidded on a rain-soaked and foggy highway 9. 
<P>
Rescuers worked for about 45 minutes to free a 33-year- old man
trapped in the wreckage. The bus driver and a woman riding in
the front of the bus were also trapped and had to be cut free.

<P>
Bus driver Gilbert Crosby of Mississauga remains in hospital in
critical condition. In serious condition are Nancy Shock of Oakville,
Darlene Collins of Etobicoke, and Deepak Gandai of Mississauga.

<H3>Review Lay-Offs</H3>

<P>
The Niagara Falls Review has cut 13 jobs, three months after the
newspaper was sold to a division of Hollinger. 
<P>
Publisher John Vankooten cited increases in newsprint costs, a
declining advertising base and a circulation drop as reasons.
The Review now employs about 100 people and has a daily circulation
of about 18,800. 
<HR>

<H3>Restaurants-Brewers</H3>

<P>
The Ontario Restaurant Association says beer drinkers are being
soaked for millions of dollars a year because the government isn't
regulating the province's private beer monopoly closely enough.

<P>
Association President Paul Oliver says the government allows the
68-year-old Brewers Retail system, and its regulator, the Liquor
Control Board of Ontario too much freedom to set prices.
<P>
Oliver is calling for Ontario's Consumer Minister to launch an
investigation. 
<HR>

<H3>Crows</H3>

<P>
Capistrano may have swallows... but Essex County has crows...
lots of them. So many, in fact, that it has been described as
a scene from the famous Alfred Hitchcock motion picture &quot;The
Birds&quot;.
<HR>

<H3>Past Forgetting </H3>

<P>
The ending of the Second World War 50 years ago is being observed
Friday in Toronto with a special musical entertainment. &quot;Past
Forgetting&quot; re-creates the soldier shows popular at home,
in Europe and the war zones between 1939 and 1945. Alex Reynolds
recalls.
<P>
<I>Memories are long lasting, and the six year global conflict
a half century ago is still fresh for many. </I>
<P>
<I>These memories are bittersweet. Ironically some are happy...as
happy as one can be in war. The happiness came from moral- building
troop shows. &quot;Past Forgetting&quot; remembers the music of
the time, played, sung and danced by &quot;Under The Umbrella
Tree&quot; star Holly Larocque...with a cast of 15, backed by
the Canadian forces band. </I>
<P>
<I>The show lights up a dark time when one realistically looked
no further than the next day. &quot;Forgetting&quot; is nostalgia
as well as history lesson making the show a family experience.
The show plays Massey Hall Friday night. Alex Reynolds, Channel
Eleven News. </I>

<H3>Ontario Debt-Credit</H3>

<P>
Queen's Park may be getting set for spending cuts far beyond anyone's
expectations.
<P>
A new report by a bond rating service says Ontario will have to
slash up to 10 billion dollars from it's budget.
<P>
But as Marci Ien reports tonight, Finance Minister Ernie Eves
is downplaying the report. 
<P>
<I>Finance Minister Ernie Eves isn't buying a report released
by the dominion bond rating service.</I>
<P>
<I>The report suggests Queen's Park will have to dig even deeper
if it wants to keep its promise to lower income taxes.</I>
<P>
<I>Dominion Bond Rating Service says the province may have to
cut spending by up to 10 billion dollars during it's term if it's
to follow through on a promised 30 per cent income tax cut.</I>
<P>
<I>But Eves says a closer estimate would be 8-billion dollars
in cuts.</I>
<P>
<I>Financial Analyst Jeff Moore co-authored the Dominion Bond
Rating report. </I>
<P>
<I>Meanwhile in the Legislature today opposition parties took
the Tories to task... </I>
<P>
<I>At Queen's Park, Marci Ien, Channel 11 News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Martin Report</H3>

<P>
Ottawa's deficit for 1994-95 has come in more than two-billion
dollars under projections.
<P>
Finance Minister Paul Martin says the final deficit tally is 37.5
billion dollars. He attributes the drop to lower- than-expected
spending on government programs. 
<HR>

<H3>OPSEU Demo</H3>

<P>
Ontario's public service unions staged a noisy protest outside
Queen's Park today.
<P>
About 300 demonstrators rallied against what they call anti-union
policies.
<P>
This after Tories scrapped a law which barred the use of replacement
workers during strikes.
<P>
A new bill was pushed through the Legislature last night...but
union leaders say the government won't get away with it.
<HR>

<H3>WCB-Witmer</H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, the Ontario government has begun the process of overhauling
the province's workers' compensation board. 
<P>
Labour Minister Elizabeth Witmer has introduced legislation that
she says will make the troubled board more accountable.
<HR>

<H3>Change Clip</H3>

<P>
Lucien Bouchard is on the verge of an important decision... will
he remain as leader of the Bloc Quebecois and official opposition
in Ottawa, or replace Jacques Parizeau as Premier of Quebec? 
<P>
Bouchard is so revered in his home province, the hurdles he must
clear to replace Parizeau amount to little more than formalities.
<P>
Bouchard will meet with his caucus tonight, and announce his final
decision tomorrow. But today, he was dismissing Ottawa's announcement
that it will act within days to recognize Quebec as a distinct
society. 
<P>
Meanwhile, intergovernmental affairs minister Marcel Masse was
busy clarifying remarks that Prime Minister Chretien had made
regarding a constitutional veto for Quebec.
<HR>

<H3>Council Clip</H3>

<P>
While the Premiers of Canada's promises seem anxious to grab some
federal powers away from Ottawa under the guise of satisfying
Quebec's demands, some voices are urging that current federal
powers remain intact. Those voices belong to the council of Canadians.

<HR>

<H3>Marchi-Immigration</H3>

<P>
Admit 195- thousand. 
<P>
That's how many people waiting in line will get in to Canada next
year. And the number could rise to 220-thousand. 
<P>
The Federal Immigration Minister set the target today in the house
of commons. Sergio Marchi said Canada can find room next year
for five-thousand more immigrants than it planned to take in this
year. 
<HR>

<H3>London fire</H3>

<P>
An elderly woman died in a house fire in London, Ontario last
night... and investigators say it will take some time to determine
the cause. damage is estimated at 150-thousand.
<HR>

<H3>Teen Torture </H3>

<P>
Ottawa police have arrested one of three people wanted in connection
with the torture death of a 17-year-old boy. 
<P>
A 17-year-old girl, who can't be identified, was arrested during
an early-morning raid today.
<P>
Canada-wide first-degree murder warrants are still outstanding
for two men in their twenties. 
<P>
Sylvain Leduc died after he and three friends were kidnapped at
gun-point last week and tortured in a high-rise apartment.

<H3>Parizeau Clips</H3>

<P>
Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau is resigning.
<P>
Speaking in French, he told reporters at a news conference less
than an hour ago that he had made the decision to step down some
time ago in the event sovereigntists were not successful in the
referendum.
<P>
He also commented on remarks he made last night about being defeated
by the ethnic community, saying he chose his words poorly. 
<HR>

<H3>Parizeau Tag </H3>

<P>
Bloc Quebecois leader Lucien Bouchard says he will not make a
bid to take over as leader of the Parti Quebecois, and Premier
of Quebec. 
<HR>

<H3>Chretien Rxn.</H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, in Ottawa, Prime Minister Chretien, learning of the
decision refused to speculate on who might succeed Parizeau...
nor would he speculate on prize's reasons for resigning so quickly.
<HR>

<H3>Poulter-No</H3>

<P>
The Canadian Federation remains alive tonight... but it is not
well.
<P>
That's the observation that is being made over and over again,
following yesterday's referendum that revealed almost half of
all Quebeckers... and sixty percent of Francophone Quebeckers...
want to leave Canada.
<P>
Federalist and separatist voices alike are calling for change...
but there is no clear definition of the form it will take.
<P>
While cooler heads prevail today, there was some violence last
night in Montreal, shortly after the no victory became clear.

<HR>

<H3>Ontario re: Quebec</H3>

<P>
Ontario's political leaders are among those calling for change
following last night's narrow &quot;no&quot; victory.
<P>
But as Marci Ien reports, politicians say changes to the constitution,
granting special status to Quebec could still be a ways off.
<P>
<I>They said it would be too close to call. A decision that could
have meant the end of a unified Canada.</I>
<P>
<I>...But by a slim margin of little more than one per cent....Quebecois
said &quot;no&quot; to separation...but a resounding &quot;yes&quot;
to change.</I>
<P>
<I>Meanwhile... news of a &quot;no&quot; victory reignited confidence
in financial markets ...the Canadian dollar shot up more than
a cent and interest rates started to fall. </I>
<P>
<I>Premier mike Harris hedged questions about any specific constitutional
changes...saying it's too early to make any promises.</I>
<P>
<I>Meanwhile, Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau wasted no time laying
blame for the results. Parizeau says money and the ethnic vote
were the reason for the narrow &quot;no&quot; victory. In Toronto,
Marci Ien, Channel 11 News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Inuit Clip</H3>

<P>
Inuit in northern Quebec have joined the chorus of voices suggesting
last night's close vote amounts to a demand for constitutional
change.
<P>
They voted 88-percent &quot;no&quot; in yesterday's referendum,
and ninety-five percent &quot;no&quot; in one of their own last
week. 
<HR>

<H3>Bill Seven - Labor</H3>

<P>
Switching topics now... Ontario's new labour legislation is about
to receive third and final reading.
<P>
The tough bill that wipes out many of the gains made by the labour
movement has outraged workers. And at least one labour leader
feels it may lead to violence.
<P>
The story from Dwight Ryan. 
<P>
<I>In the Ontario Legislature, Labour Minister Elizabeth Witmer
defends Bill 7, her government's labour law that has outraged
the labour movement.</I>
<P>
<I>But NDP leader Bob Rae isn't buying it, nor are the province's
labour unions.</I>
<P>
<I>Enormous strides gained by workers under the NDP's Bill 40
will be rolled back. Replacement workers during strikes will again
be okay. Secret ballots must be held to certify workers or to
initiate strike action.</I>
<P>
<I>600 Canadian autoworkers gathered in Toronto to plot strategy.
Union Leader Buzz Hargrove says labour relations in Ontario have
been set back 50 years.</I>
<P>
<I>Buzz Hargrove's anger is shared by Gord Wilson, head of the
Ontario Federation of Labour.</I>
<P>
<I>Wilson fears that tensions between management and labour could
boil over. While the Labour Minister calls for calm, union leaders
are planning a one day province-wide strike. If they're going
to lose many of the gains they've made over the past four decades,
they're not going to do it without a fight.</I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Dwight Ryan, Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Electra </H3>

<P>
From the 1930s through to the 50s, &quot;b&quot; movies were low-budget
western, mystery and sci-fi potboilers from the Hollywood factory.
<P>
They provided steady work for actors who became &quot;b&quot;
grade stars, and as such were rarely signed for mainstream productions.
<P>
The &quot;b&quot; movie is still with us, and as Alex Reynolds
reports, the cowboy and detective have been replaced by gratuitous
violence, gore and sex. 
<P>
<I>&quot;B&quot; movies, once on the lower half of a big screen
double bill....now generally go straight to the home video market
....and make money.</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;Electra&quot; fits right into the &quot;B&quot; genre.
But it's by design.</I>
<P>
<I>Julian Grant is Canada's &quot;King of the B movies&quot;.
</I>
<P>
<I>Dancer-turned -actor Dyanne Dimarco's hard-edged role in &quot;Electra&quot;
fits like a glove. </I>
<P>
<I>Grant takes a no-nonsense approach to his art through a twinkle-in-his
-eye, tongue-in-cheek philosophy. </I>
<P>
<I>&quot;Electra&quot; opens in January, but gets a free public
midnight screening at Toronto's Uptown Theatre Halloween night.</I>
<P>
<I>A raging party follows. You're all invited.</I>

<H3>Referendum</H3>

<P>
Less than two hours from now, it will be all over but the counting.
And a couple of hours after that, it will be clear whether Quebeckers
voted to remain part of Canada, or to become a sovereign nation.
<P>
This is the question to which Quebeckers are answering &quot;yes&quot;
or &quot;no&quot; in a province-wide referendum:
<P>
<I><B>&quot;Do you agree that Quebec should become sovereign,
after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic
and political partnership with the scope of the bill respecting
the future of Quebec and of the agreement signed on June 12, 1995?&quot;</B></I>
<P>
There is a very heavy voter turn-out, as Deborah Walker reports.

<P>
<I>Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau cast his &quot;yes&quot; vote
today, confident Quebec would have a mandate to become an independent
country by day's end.</I>
<P>
<I>It is a decision that could rip apart a 128-year-old country,
or plunge Canada into another protracted round of constitutional
negotiations.</I>
<P>
<I>Neither option is palatable to the rest of Canada.</I>
<P>
<I>Quebec Liberal Leader Daniel Johnson voted in the same neighbourhood
as Parizeau, and he is just as confident in predicting victory
for the &quot;no&quot; side.</I>
<P>
<I>But it is the five-million eligible Quebec voters, and not
the politicians, who are now deciding the fate of their province,
and of Canada. And many of them fear the vote will leave not just
Canada, but Quebec divided, regardless of the referendum's outcome.</I>
<P>
<I>Meanwhile, in the House of Commons, MP's burst into a spontaneous
rendition of &quot;O Canada&quot; today. The song echoed off the
empty seats of bloc Quebecois members, who boycotted Parliament
today in honour of the referendum.</I>
<P>
<I>Deborah walker, Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Freed Live </H3>

<P>
Despite what some believe to be an ambiguous question, leaders
from both sides attempted to make it clear during the campaign
leading up to today's voting ... that a &quot;yes&quot; win starts
the ball rolling toward Quebec sovereignty... and a &quot;no&quot;
victory maintains the status quo...
<P>
Although Prime Minister Chretien sent out some strong eleventh
hour hints that his door is open to negotiation...
<P>
One of our reporters in Montreal tonight is Ottawa Bureau Chief
Jonathan Freed...
<HR>

<H3>Coverage Promo </H3>

<P>
We will be keeping you update to date throughout the evening,
interrupting regular programming as necessary to bring you referendum
results and major developments... 
<P>
We will also have speeches from leaders on both the &quot;yes&quot;
and &quot;no&quot; side of the question, and of course the speech
from the Prime Minister.
<P>
That's throughout the evening. 
<HR>

<H3>Tire Inquest Ends</H3>

<P>
To other news now, a coroner's jury is recommending a massive
regulatory overhaul of Ontario's trucking industry.
<P>
The 5-member panel spent three weeks looking into two cases of
Toronto motorists killed when their vehicles were hit by flying
truck wheels.
<P>
As Marci Ien reports tonight, the jury handed down 31 recommendations
in all. 
<P>
<I>For almost a month they have re-lived the tragedies that claimed
the lives of those they loved. ...as counsel presented the evidence
surrounding the deaths of Angela Worona and James Tyrell.</I>
<P>
<I>Both died in separate but similar highway accidents after their
vehicles were hit by flying truck tires.</I>
<P>
<I>But on this day the Worona and Tyrell families would have some
sort of justice...a sense of relief...if not a sense of closure.</I>
<P>
<I>After 18 hours of deliberations, the five-member jury handed
down 31 recommendations. ...among them... training and certification
for all tire installers and mechanics... ...that safety violations
be prosecuted--with criminal charges laid when appropriate...and
that fines for unsafe trucks be stiffer.</I>
<P>
<I>Other recommendations included a ban on cosmetic covers over
wheel nuts which the inquest heard could hide dangerous problems...and
stiffer fines for issuing false inspection tickets.</I>
<P>
<I>The victims' families say they're pleased with the findings
...but are urging the government to act quickly.</I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Marci Ien, Channel 11 News.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Gordon Domm</H3>

<P>
Ontario's highest court has agreed to hear an appeal from a retired
police officer who was fined four-thousand dollars for defying
a court- ordered publication ban on Karla Homolka's manslaughter
trial.
<P>
Fifty- eight-year-old Gordon Domm was found guilty by a jury in
May of defying the ban by distributing copies of articles with
information about Homolka's trial.
<P>
In his trial, Domm argued the ban is part of a slow erosion of
democracy in Canada. 
<P>
Justice Francis Kovacs said the ban was needed to preserve a fair
trial for Paul Bernardo. 
<HR>

<H3>Dirty Dancing Done</H3>

<P>
Metro Toronto's by-law banning &quot;lap&quot; dancing has been
upheld by a panel of the Ontario Divisional Court, headed by Chief
Justice Roy Mcmurtry. 
<P>
The controversial practice permitted contact between the strippers

<H3>No General Strike</H3>

<P>
The head of the Ontario Federation of Labor has put plans for
a one-day strike on hold.
<P>
Gord Wilson says there's just not enough time to organize unions
across the province to protest the Conservative Government's changes
to the labor law.
<P>
Wilson had originally planned to have a number of unions stage
a one-day strike on Wednesday. 
<P>
The OFL President says however that a strike will happen eventually,
but they have to follow democratic methods.

<H3>Chretien/Rally</H3>

<P>
It was a massive show of friendship for Quebeckers... as 150 thousand
Canadians from Ontario and other provinces converged on Montreal
today for a huge unity rally.
<P>
Prime Minister Jean Chretien was in peak form, speaking without
notes. He told the crowd Quebeckers should vote &quot;no&quot;
Monday and take equal pride in being Quebeckers and Canadians.

<P>
Canada will move into the 21st century &quot;united from sea to
sea, proud of its two official languages.&quot; 
<HR>

<H3>Live/Donut: Miller</H3>

<P>
The &quot;yes&quot; side has dismissed the rally as a political
event set up by federalist politicians. But what is more important
is how ordinary Quebeckers view this action.
<P>
Mark Miller is our reporter in Montreal... he was at today's rally...
and since then, he's been talking to a lot of people... Mark...

<P>
Thanks Mark, and of course we'll have more coverage of today's
Unity Rally coming up on Canada Tonight at six thirty.
<HR>

<H3>School Commercials</H3>

<P>
Ontario schools are becoming a big market for businesses to sell
their products.
<P>
According to a new study, school children have become a captive
audience for corporations to push their products and their company
logos. 
<HR>

<H3>Biker Bust</H3>

<P>
Five bikers are under arrest in Toronto after a police raid on
a Loners motorcycle clubhouse in the Jane and Lawrence area. 
<P>
Tear gas was used in the raid in the suburban city of York.
<P>
Police say they found firearms and explosives in the building.

<HR>

<H3>Fort Bragg Sniper </H3>

<P>
Gunfire disrupted an early morning training exercise today at
the US army base in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. 
<P>
A gunman opened fire on members of the 82nd Airborne Division
just as they were beginning a five mile run. 
<P>
One soldier was killed...18 others wounded. 
<P>
An active duty soldier has been arrested. Investigators from the
army's criminal division have recovered a non-military issue gun
from the scene. 
<P>
Most of the wounded are being treated at the army hospital on
the base.
<HR>

<H3>Gorazde Children</H3>

<P>
United Nations officials say the cease-fire in Bosnia is holding
very well. But as the first signs of peace slowly return, the
lingering effects of the conflict are still visible, especially
in the eyes of the young.

<HR>

<H3>Quebec re: Rally</H3>

<P>
As many as one hundred thousand Canadians... including tens of
thousands of Ontarians... are getting to Montreal any way they
can to participate in a huge unity rally there tomorrow.
<P>
Money was raised to rent busses... and airlines slashed fares
to get as many Canadians as possible to the rally.
<P>
Our reporter in Montreal... mark miller... is monitoring the reaction
of montrealers to all of this sudden attention. 
<HR>

<H3>Ontario Referendum</H3>

<P>
The Government of Ontario today introduced an all-party motion
which calls on Quebecois to vote no to sovereignty on Monday.

<P>
The motion was unanimously passed by all three parties.
<HR>

<H3>Welland - Francophone</H3>

<P>
Francophones outside Quebec are watching the leadup to the referendum
with nervous anticipation.
<P>
In Welland where 15 percent of the population holds on to its
French culture, people are asking themselves today what will a
yes vote mean for them on Monday.
<HR>

<H3>Natives-Quebec</H3>

<P>
Canada's native people continue to speak out against Quebec separation.
<P>
Today, the Assembly of First Nations called on the Federal Government
to use all means necessary to protect native rights in Quebec.
<P>
Among other things, Quebec natives are demanding constitutional
veto power. They also want Ottawa to ensure that all existing
native treaties are upheld in the event of a vote. But not all
aboriginal leaders see Quebec sovereignty as a bad thing.
<HR>

<H3>Trajceski Funeral</H3>

<P>
Toronto Transit Commission vehicles stopped for one minute this
morning to honor an employee murdered on the job earlier this
week. 
<P>
The vehicles came to a stop as a funeral mass began for Dimitrija
&quot;Tommy&quot; (tray-chess-key) at St. Clement Cathedral on
Overlea Boulevard.
<P>
Today's procession included hundreds of transit employees wearing
black arm bands as well as other city employees.
<P>
Trajceski, a married father of two, was stabbed to death in the
Victoria Park subway station early Monday morning. The 54- year
old man was ambushed by a lone bandit outside the station after
locking up.
<P>
Trajceski was the first TTC employee murdered on the job.

<H3>Chretien Tee-up</H3>

<P>
Prime Minister Chretien goes on national television less than
an hour from now... and he may tell Quebeckers what Canada has
to offer them if they vote &quot;no&quot; in Monday's referendum.
<P>
Polls suggest Quebeckers... even those planning to reject sovereignty...
want answers.
<HR>

<H3>Tobin Clip</H3>

<P>
And we will be carrying the Prime Minister's address and Lucien
Bouchard's rebuttal live here on CHCH TV at seven o'clock.
<P>
Thousands of Ontarians will ride buses for unity on Friday.
<P>
Liberal MP's are organizing free bus rides in many communities
to a big &quot;no&quot; rally in Montreal. Private donations are
covering the cost of the buses. 
<P>
Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin says Quebeckers should be shown
how much the rest of Canada wants it to remain part of the country.

<HR>

<H3>Tire Inquest-Family</H3>

<P>
Ontario Provincial Police say the Ministry of Transportation has
not gone far enough in its safety recommendations for truck drivers.
<P>
As Marci Ien reports tonight, police say the road to recovery
in the trucking industry begins with stiffer fines and extensive
training.
<P>
<I>There are thousands of tractor trailers on Ontario's highways...but
how many of them are safe?</I>
<P>
<I>according to recent o-p-p road check stats...the results are
dismal. ...police found that 43 per cent of vehicles are in such
bad shape they should be out of business. And that includes ...the
two trucks in question at an inquest underway in Toronto.</I>
<P>
<I>Angela Worona and James Tyrell ...both 31...died in separate
but almost identical highway accidents involving runaway truck
tires.</I>
<P>
<I>the inquest has heard that the drivers of those trucks did
not perform proper pre-trip inspections... although police witnesses
have testified that there is a 27 item safety check list for truckers.</I>
<P>
<I>...and there are other problems ...problems that stem from
a lack of training in the truck industry...and what police say
is a shortage of qualified drivers on the road.</I>
<P>
<I>Sgt. Wolf says stiffer fines for unfit truckers could also
help make our highways safer.</I>
<P>
<I>The jury is expected to be charged this Friday...and will bring
down its recommendations next Monday morning.</I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Marci Ien, Channel 11 News.</I>

<H3>Bus/Train Crash </H3>

<P>
US federal investigators are on the scene of a fatal crash between
a commuter train and school bus in suburban Chicago.
<P>
At least five people are confirmed dead. Dozens of others are
injured&#133; some critically. The bus was carrying about 30 high
school students.
<P>
No one on board the commuter train was hurt.
<P>
The crash happened in Fox River Grove about 37 miles northeast
of Chicago. 
<HR>

<H3>Poverty Coalition</H3>

<P>
About three hundred demonstrators converged on Queens Park today
to protest government cuts to Welfare. 
<P>
They wanted to talk to Premier Mike Harris&#133; but he refused
to meet with them. 
<HR>

<H3>Bill 7 Demo </H3>

<P>
There was another disturbance at the legislature today&#133; this
one inside.
<P>
Representatives from the civil service union, left their seats
in the public gallery and marched through the halls chanting shame,
shame, when the Harris government set a time limit on the debate
of legislation which would repeal the &quot;anti scab&quot; law
brought in by the former NDP government of Bob Rae.
<P>
The union members were accompanied by a phalanx of security guards
as they marched out of the building.

<H3>Bank Rate Costs</H3>

<P>
There has been a major hike in the bank of Canada rate.
<P>
The jump of nearly a full point was successful in stopping, at
least temporarily, the free fall of the Canadian dollar.
<P>
But Canada's chartered banks are taking a wait and see attitude
...refusing to increase mortgage and other lending rates.
<P>
Still, a yes vote in Monday's Quebec referendum will lead to higher
interest rates and investors remain nervous.
<P>
Dwight Ryan has the story from Toronto.
<P>
<I>On Bay Street ...another day of investor jitters as the Quebec
referendum approaches. </I>
<P>
<I>Fears that our dollar would plummet again and fears that TSE
investors would again dump Canadian stocks.</I>
<P>
<I>By day's end however, a bit of a recovery for the TSE 300 index
after yesterdays loss of more than 120 points. And our dollar
moved upward ..albeit slowly.</I>
<P>
<I>An increase of 98 basis points ..almost a full point was enough
to stabilize the dollar. The free fall was stopped.</I>
<P>
<I>But CIBC Chief Economist Josh Mendelsohn says a &quot;yes&quot;
vote in Monday's referendum will lead to higher rates.</I>
<P>
<I>For the time being, Canada's chartered banks are holding steady..not
raising mortgage and other lending rates in response to the massive
hike in the central bank rate.</I>
<P>
<I>But investors remain nervous feeling any further bad news could
trigger a sell off.</I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Dwight Ryan, Channel 11 News.</I>

<P>
Are you geographically challenged? One of those people who can't

<P>
Well, take heart; technology is about to come to your rescue:
Scot Urquhart explains: 
<P>
<I>This is the story of the one that didn't get away ... not the
fish ... the idea: the fish almost cost Dave Hill his life ...
when he got lost, north of Temagami ... and spent three days in
the bush.</I>
<P>
<I>Enter the Navitraker ...the hand held global positioning system,
that works from six military satellites.</I>
<P>
<I>The Navitraker will take a map ... any map, marine chart, aerial
photograph or visual image, and produce an on-screen direction
finder; that anyone can use; whether they can read a map, or not.</I>
<P>
<I>Hikers, fishermen, boaters, pilots ... people who can't find
the grocery store ... anybody can use it... including the military.</I>
<P>
<I>This prototype will be replaced by a sleek ... home market
version that will sell for about a thousand bucks ... and by next
summer Dave Hill hopes, no one will ever again have to ask ...
where on earth, am I?</I>

<H3>Dollar Dive</H3>

<P>
It has frequently been said that money is a coward, fleeing from
even the remotest possibility of national disintegration and civil
unrest.
<P>
Canada's position on that huge international money wheel is particularly
precarious, because of the extraordinary amount of foreign investment
in this country.
<P>
enter public opinion polls showing the &quot;yes&quot; side in
the Quebec referendum poised for possible victory next Monday...
and the stage is set for a plummeting dollar, higher interest
rates, and a massive stock market sell-off. All of those things
have been going on today... as Channel 11's Dwight Ryan reports.
<P>
<I>The Canadian dollar plummeted again. down 88/1o0ths against
its American counterpart to 72.99 cents US.</I>
<P>
<I>Combined with Friday trading, the Canadian dollar has dropped
more than a cent and a half US.</I>
<P>
<I>Investors are beginning to weigh the possibility of a victory
by the yes side in Monday's Quebec referendum.</I>
<P>
<I>Ruth Getter is Senior Vice-President and Chief Economist with
the Toronto Dominion Bank.</I>
<P>
<I>While the dollar plunged, so did Canadian and interest sensitive
stocks. At day's end, the TSE 300 composite index was off more
than 122 points.</I>
<P>
<I>Fred Ketchen of Scotia McLeod says investors have the jitters.</I>
<P>
<I>Ruth Getter, meanwhile, says a yes win in the referendum would
not mean the end of the world. Once the reality sunk in, the Canadian
dollar would recover within a few days.</I>
<P>
<I>Still, stock and money market volatility will continue at least
until the Quebec vote.</I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Dwight Ryan, Channel 11 News.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Dairy Future</H3>

<P>
In rural Quebec ... meanwhile... most dairy farmers are set to
vote &quot;no&quot;.
<P>
That's because a lot of milk from Quebec finds its way to other
provinces. Still, a few farmers intend to vote &quot;yes&quot;.

<HR>

<H3>Subway Murder </H3>

<P>
Toronto police are hoping this enhanced security videotape will
provide them a solid lead in the stabbing death of a subway ticket
collector.
<P>
The transit employee was killed early today in an apparent robbery
at the Victoria Park station in east Toronto.
<P>
He has been identified as 54-year-old Dimitrija (tray-chess-key)
of Scarborough. 
<HR>

<H3>Etobicoke Murder </H3>

<P>
And there was yet another homicide in metro today.
<P>
A man was shot dead in the lobby of a north Etobicoke apartment
building around 3:30 this morning. 
<P>
The bullet hit him in the head. 
<P>
Police are trying to determine a motive for the shooting. 
<HR>

<H3>Runciman-Parole</H3>

<P>
Ontario's Solicitor General Bob Runciman today announced changes
to the parole system.
<P>
Changes, which he says, will make it tougher for serious offenders
to get back on the streets. 
<P>
Runciman also appointed thirty-four new members to the parole
board ..including some corrections officers, five former police
chiefs, a retired judge and a number of men and women with business
management backgrounds. 
<HR>

<H3>Poverty Newser</H3>

<P>
A group of people on Welfare say they were told by Government
Security they could not have a planned news conference in the
Queens Park Media Studio, because their 15 member delegation was
too large. 
<P>
Some MPPs say the Harris government is getting paranoid about
security.

<H3>Tsubouchi-List</H3>

<P>
Adding insult to injury, Social Services Minister David Tsubouchi
released a shopping list for the poor today... and naturally,
anti-poverty groups and opposition parties had their rhetorical
way with this bit of nonsense.
<HR>

<H3>Referendum/N.B.</H3>

<P>
As the referendum campaign rages on in Quebec, Maritimers are
wondering what's to become of them if a new sovereign nation ends
up splitting Atlantic Canada off from Ontario and the west. And
they're not amused.
<HR>

<H3>Journey/Freedom 3</H3>

<P>
About 150 years ago... when slaves fleeing bondage arrived at
the end of the escape route known as the underground railroad,
they faced even more adversity. but against all odds and naysayers,
they built their communities... homes, businesses, churches, and
schools. 
<P>
In the final segment of her series &quot;Journey to Freedom,&quot;
Marci Ien takes us to the towns of Dresden and north Buxton.
<P>
<I>North Buxton, Ontario...a tiny community just outside Chatham.</I>
<P>
<I>Farmers toil on land ripe with the colours of early autumn.</I>
<P>
<I>Rustic farmhouses punctuate a canvas only nature could paint.</I>
<P>
<I>But the skies over Buxton have not always been so blue...as
one of the first settlements of refugee slaves from the south
...Buxton's story is complex. </I>
<P>
<I>King bought this land and sold it to ex-slaves for two dollars
and 50 cents an acre.</I>
<P>
<I>And stay they did...building up a successful settlement including
a school which spawned an impressive roster of graduates.</I>
<P>
<I>The local museum boasts original items from the north Buxton
settlement... including a model of the village in 1883.</I>
<P>
<I>Miles away in Dresden, Ontario ...the famous homestead of a
former slave and preacher named Josiah Henson. Born into slavery
in Maryland in 1789...Henson was later sold to a Kentucky family
...where he became a slave overseer... he would escape through
the underground railroad...later an author named Harriet Beacher
Stowe would hear his courageous story...and be inspired to write
a book called &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot;.</I>
<P>
<I>The Henson settlement would serve as a haven for former slaves
...a place where they could learn trades and skills ...this settlement
like many others would dissolve after slavery was abolished in
the south...as former slaves returned to the U.S. in search of
family members...but their struggle for freedom would never be
forgotten... Pastor Burrey back at Sandwich First Baptist Church
in Chatham sums it up best.</I>
<P>
<I>Marci Ien, Channel 11 News. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Penny-Less Store</H3>

<P>
They're no good in a phone booth.
<P>
You can't feed them to vending machines.
<P>
And if an Oakville retailer has his way, your pennies will no
longer be welcome in Canadian cash registers.
<P>
Deborah Walker reports.
<P>
<I>Customers who come calling on ducks gift store in Bronte village
need no longer weigh down their wallets with pennies.</I>
<P>
<I>The lowest denomination of Canadian currency has been banished
from the premises.</I>
<P>
<I>The new two-dollar coin will take over the space vacated by
pennies in Bill Morgan's cash drawer. and Bill hopes to inspire
other Canadian retailers to become penniless.</I>
<P>
<I>In Bronte, Deborah Walker, Channel Eleven News. </I>

</UL>

<HR>

<H3>Snobelen-Teachers</H3>

<P>
The battle lines between Queen's Park and several Catholic school
boards have been drawn. 
<P>
Education Minister John Snobelen is ready to lay down the law...
a law that says Separate Schools can no longer hire only Catholic
teachers.
<P>
But there is defiance from three boards ... one near Belleville,
another near Ottawa, and the Kent Country Board near Chatham.
This after the Ontario Separate School Trustees Association called
the law unconstitutional. 
<P>
Snobelen says he has written to the Trustees Association ordering
it to obey the law. 
<P>
The Trustees Association, however, is considering taking the issue
to the courts. 
<HR>

<H3>Palladini Patrols</H3>

<P>
Transportation Minister Al Palladini maintains that taking emergency
patrol vehicles off the highways in the greater Toronto area will
not constitute a safety hazard.
<P>
Palladini says its a duplication of services that costs the taxpayers
900-thousand dollars. 
<P>
The Transportation Minister also says he will be announcing a
new road safety program next week. Its expected to be tough on
truckers with faulty rigs. 
<HR>

<H3>Tsubouchi-Legis.</H3>

<P>
Opposition parties continue to hammer away at the credibility
of Social Services Minister David Tsubouchi.
<P>
The minister has been in hot water for admitting he unknowingly
signed a draft of regulations which could have cut thousands of
disabled people off welfare.
<HR>

<H3>Journey/Freedom 2 </H3>

<P>
In the days when slavery thrived on plantations in the American
deep south, church was the only place where slaves were allowed
to congregate. And so the church became an integral part of their
lives.
<P>
There, slaves would not only learn about god ...but also music,
literature and a sense of community.
<P>
As Marci Ien reports in her series &quot;Journey to Freedom&quot;,
the church also served another purpose...it was a hiding place
for slaves who had escaped the south and came to Canada on the
underground railroad. 
<HR>

<P>
<I>If the walls of Sandwich First Baptist Church could talk...what
a tale they would tell...stories of black fugitives fleeing from
slavery in the states... ...of people tirelessly working together
to build a community in which the church was central.</I>
<P>
<I>It served as a school, forum, political arena, art gallery
and conservatory of music. the original Sandwich Baptist Church
was a log cabin...set on the same lot where the present church
stands. In 1851 the log cabin was torn down and the present church
erected. </I>
<P>
<I>On this day... sunlight streams through the stained-glass windows.
There's an air of peace. Pastor Burrey's pulpit is empty ..as
are the pews...only a lonely bible peeks out. </I>
<P>
<I>Because bounty hunters would cross Canadian borders looking
for runaway slaves...the church would serve as more than a house
of prayer...it would be a house of refuge ...literally. It may
look like a dusty basement complete with old cans and boxes ...but
nestled under the floorboards of the church...it was a hiding
place for slaves on the run. </I>
<P>
<I>60 miles away ...another church steeped in black history...
the First Baptist Church in Chatham...a handsome building with
an ornate interior....and intriguing past. later, the Church would
be used as a meeting place for famed abolitionist John Brown...Brown
had wanted to stage an armed uprising against slave states...it
backfired when his plan was leaked...he was later hanged for treason.
</I>
<P>
<I>But at the front of First Baptist...are the table and chair
John Brown once used...are proudly displayed by a church rooted
in history. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton, I stopped by Stewart Memorial Church...a church
that was also a stop for runaway slaves on the underground railroad.
And that included the man who pastored the congregation. A refugee
slave himself called Josiah Henson ...but known as &quot;Uncle
Tom&quot;. </I>
<P>
<I>First that church was a log cabin...years later it would become
what it is today...this brick building ...with an impressive interior...
...immaculate... with wooden pews a pristine pulpit and an unforgettable
past.</I>
<P>
<I>Tomorrow on &quot;journey to freedom&quot;...a closer look
at Josiah Henson and his homestead ...known as Uncle Tom's Cabin.</I>
<P>
<I>That and more in the final installment of Journey to Freedom.
</I>

<H3>Tsubouchi Dth. Watch</H3>

<P>
Ontario's Social Services Minister was back on the hot seat again
today over a second error in changes to the Family Benefits Act.

<P>
The minister says that error along with another one discovered
by opposition parties yesterday has been fixed.
<HR>

<H3>CUPE-Hospital Cuts</H3>

<P>
Hospital workers from across metro Toronto held a day of protest,
to fight recommendations of the district health council that would
see 12 metro hospitals closed. 
<P>
About 200 nurses, x-ray technicians, administrative, dietary and
housekeeping staff and other hospital staff linked arms in a symbolic
ring of protection around women's college hospital.. That is just
one of hospitals recommended for closure. The workers says the
recommendations would result in sixteen hundred fewer beds, shorter
hospital stays for patients and the layoff of some 12-thousand
employees across Toronto.
<HR>

<H3>London Homicide</H3>

<P>
A London man is under arrest tonight. 
<P>
24-year- old Jason David Boyd has been charged with second-degree-
murder in connection with yesterday's fatal stabbing in that city.

<P>
It's London's third homicide of the year.
<HR>

<H3>Underground Renos</H3>

<P>
The new president of the Ontario homebuilders association says
the underground economy is booming in his industry. 
<P>
And Laverne Brubacher says legitimate renovators are suffering
as a result. 
<P>
That story from Dwight Ryan... 
<P>
<I>Each year, Ontario residents pay millions of dollars to contractors
for home renovation work. </I>
<P>
<I>But an increasing amount of that work is being done under the
table..part of the underground economy. </I>
<P>
<I>Laverne Brubacher, the new president of the Ontario homebuilders
association says tax-free deals are costing legitimate builders
billions. </I>
<P>
<I>Dundas contractor Ron Deadman says its hard to compete with
under the table deals. </I>
<P>
<I>Deadman has worked as a contractor for more than 40 years.
He feels city hall can help stop the underground economy by tightening
the procedure for obtaining building permits. </I>
<P>
<I>Deadman says few customers ask for tax free cash deals. Still,
the underground economy thrives. and legitimate contractors find
it more difficult to make an honest buck. </I>
<P>
<I>Dwight Ryan, Channel 11 News</I>.
<HR>

<H3>Journey-Freedom Pt.1</H3>

<P>
It has been a century and a half since more than 40-thousand slaves
fled their bondage... And flocked to Canada in search of freedom
from oppression in the south. 
<P>
They got here, via the underground railroad...a secret network
that helped slaves from Places like Kentucky, Mississippi, and
Georgia escape to safe havens in Canadian cities such as Windsor,
Chatham, St. Catharines and Hamilton. 
<P>
In the first of a three-part series reporter Marci Ien tracks
the legacy of the underground railroad and those who made
<P>
The &quot;Journey to Freedom.&quot; 
<P>
<I>The underground ...slaves fleeing the American south believed
Canada was canaan ...the promised land. </I>
<P>
<I>They came by the thousands via the underground railroad...which
really wasn't a railroad at all ...but a secret network started
in 1804 in Columbia, Pennsylvania...by a Quaker abolitionist named
Levi Coffin.</I>
<P>
<I>Fugitive slaves fought their way through the thick of the forest...
often barefoot, and barely clad. </I>
<P>
<I>Bounty hunters and hounds threatened their journey.</I>
<P>
<I>But freedom was their inspiration. ...Canada... their destination.</I>
<P>
<I>Freedom...was what Winston walls' grandfather... john freeman
walls yearned for. </I>
<P>
<I>Like most fugitive slaves ...his journey was almost biblical
in nature... following the north star by night...the side of the
trees that the moss grew on by day. </I>
<P>
<I>john freeman walls would live to be 96... this modest log cabin
his home. he would amass 200 acres of property. ...property that
would be handed down to his descendants ...but making it to Canada
was no easy task ...especially because walls was married to a
white woman named Jane. </I>
<P>
<I>John and Jane would fall in love and later Marry. Unable to
stay in the south ...they would come to Canada through the underground
railroad in 1840.</I>
<P>
<I>Many of those descendants are buried here in a family cemetery
at the walls historic site ...the gravestones of John and Jane
walls are there and so is aunt Stella's... Stella was said to
be the historian of the family and until her death a couple of
years ago at 102... no one could tell the story of John and Jane
Freeman Walls better than she could.</I>
<P>
<I>As conductors on the underground railroad John and Jane walls
made several dangerous trips back to south...shepherding fugitive
slaves to refuge in Canada. </I>
<P>
<I>Many of those former slaves settled on the walls property.
but many of those black settlements would become obsolete</I>
<P>
<I>When slavery was outlawed...as former slaves left Canada and
went back to the u-s...hoping to be reunited with family. </I>
<P>
<I>We'll take a look at some of those settlements ...and see what
life was like ...but coming up tomorrow on the &quot;journey to
freedom &quot;... the role of the Church...not only was it a place
of prayer...but a place of refuge and power. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Recital Hall</H3>

<P>
The lights are shining brightly at the George Weston Recital Hall
in Toronto.
<P>
The North York facility has become a Mecca for music. 
<P>
World renowned musical performers, as well as audiences are making
the hall a regular habit.
<P>
Alex Reynolds reports.
<P>
<I>Heading into its 3rd star-studded season, the hall, in the
Ford Centre for the Arts, is on the international music map. </I>
<P>
<I>Packed with classical royalty in its inaugural year, Cera was
playing it safe ....but now the programming mandate has been enlarged.
</I>
<P>
<I>The two concert venues in downtown Toronto, the Massey, and
its companion, Roy Thompson Hall could be perceived as competition
for the Weston Recital Hall, but Cera is of a different mind.
</I>
<P>
<I>This elegant hall has become home to high Octane talent ...Cecilia
Bartoli...Tony Bennett... Frederica von Stada.... Kiri te Kanawa,
and there's a seat here for you.</I>
<P>
<I>In North York, Alex Reynolds, Channel Eleven News. </I>

<H3>Tsubouchi Welfare </H3>

<P>
A warning today from Premier Mike Harris for his beleaguered Social
Services Minister, David Tsubouchi... it had better not happen
again.
<P>
This after Tsubouchi admitted he had signed documents without
knowing what was in them. Those documents, if they had been approved
by cabinet would have cut off cheques to 115 thousand seniors
and disabled. 
<HR>

<H3>Hospital Overhaul</H3>

<P>
Ontario Health Minister Jim Wilson has publicly criticized officials
in his ministry for taking action without his knowledge or approval.
<P>
Wilson says it was wrong for someone in his ministry to take control
of a major overhaul of Ottawa hospitals.
<P>
Wilson says the time has passed when Queens Park dictates policy
to local health councils. 
<P>
The health Minister says he has sent a letter of apology to the
Ottawa- Carleton district Health Council, which had been researching
hospital restructuring in Ottawa for the past two years.
<HR>

<H3>IEC. - Snobelen</H3>

<P>
Ontario's school boards know that they will have to do more with
less as the Tories attempt to curtail spending.
<P>
Today, 400 educators and members of the business community gathered
in Hamilton to see how they could share the responsibility of
educating our youth.
<P>
Dwight Ryan reports on a partnership program that costs little
and works well. 
<P>
<I>Business and education coming together.</I>
<P>
<I>Partners In Education is a program that sees members of the
business community working closely with young students in a variety
of ways.</I>
<P>
<I>Hamilton lawyer Phil Clay spends an hour a week acting as a
mentor in a north end Hamilton school.</I>
<P>
<I>For nine year-old Jory Anguish, the opportunity to spend time
with a local businessman is the highlight of his week.</I>
<P>
<I>The program started with the Hamilton Board of Education and
has now spread to three other separate and public boards. </I>
<P>
<I>The mentor program is just one example of how well Ontario's
Partners in Education program is working. </I>
<P>
<I>400 delegates to a Hamilton breakfast meeting heard about the
program's successes and mulled over ways of expanding it. And
the man who talks of running our education system as a business
was the keynote speaker. </I>
<P>
<I>School boards know that they will have to do more with less
from the provincial government. and educators believe that a greater
involvement of the local business community will help achieve
that goal.</I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton, Dwight Ryan, Channel 11 News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Harris-Shortfall </H3>

<P>
Ontario's economic slowdown may cost the Harris government one
billion dollars in revenue shortfall.
<P>
A Finance Ministry official made the prediction after two straight
quarters of economic decline.
<P>
Premier Mike Harris says it is too early to predict what future
revenues will be , but he admits he is worried. 
<P>
Harris says the income tax break he promised won't come until
the first full budget next year...and Liberal Finance Critic Gerry
Phillips says the government will be making even deeper cuts to
offset the loss.
<HR>

<H3>Gagnon Suspects</H3>

<P>
Two London men appeared in court in Ottawa today ... facing a
total of 29 charges in connection with the armed robbery of a
gun store just over a year ago.
<P>
The owner of Gagnon Sports, Roger Pardy, was shot to death in
the heist, and three others were wounded. the man from whom the
thieves' getaway car was stolen, Kenneth Thomas of Pickering,
was also murdered.
<P>
43-year-old Ronald James Woodcock and 32- year-old Roshan Norouzali
face numerous weapons and theft charges, as well as first degree
murder and second degree murder.
<P>
The same two men, as well as another suspect, also face a total
of 97 charges in their home town, in connection with a long string
of armed robberies there.
<HR>

<H3>Robillard Clip</H3>

<P>
Ottawa's Referendum Minister is already extending an olive branch
to the &quot;yes&quot; side. 
<P>
Sounding as though a victory for the &quot;no&quot; side is a
foregone conclusion, Lucienne Robillard said in a speech today
that after the October 30th referendum, even &quot;yes&quot; supporters
should help rebuild Canada.
<HR>

<H3>Guelph-Quebec Flag </H3>

<P>
The fleur-de-lis is flying in front of Guelph City Hall. 
<P>
The blue and white colours of Quebec have been hoisted up the
flagpole as a gesture of national unity. 
<P>
Most residents of the royal city believe it's the right thing
to do.
<HR>

<H3>Smoking Ban </H3>

<P>
Smoking in Toronto food courts and office buildings will soon
be forbidden.
<P>
Toronto City Council voted today to enforce the ban starting January
17th, Weedless Wednesday.
<P>
Council has also decided to look at banning cigarettes in restaurants.
<P>
And in Oakville, a new by-law makes smoking in home offices more
difficult.
<P>
It requires home offices to have a designated smoking area with
a separate ventilation system.

<H4>Good Evening, I'm Jennifer Mossop,</H4>

<HR>

<H3>Winter Roads</H3>

<P>
Look forward to a long, slow winter ...the union that represents
Ministry of Transportation workers, says cuts by the Harris Government
could put highway safety at risk this winter. 
<HR>

<H3>Tsubouchi Occupation</H3>

<P>
Another group, upset with government cuts staged a sit-in at Ministry
Offices of Social Services today. 
<P>
A group calling itself Violence Prevention Sector is demanding
the Harris government reverse its cuts to social programs. 
<P>
More than 20 women and one man occupied the offices of the Social
Services Ministry in Toronto for four hours today. They say the
government cuts to family benefits and general welfare will drastically
increase the number of women living in a life threatening situation.

<P>
The group has lost 100 per-cent of its funding. It wants to meet
with Social Services Minister David Tsubouchi to make him aware
of the consequences of those cuts.
<HR>

<H3>Tsubouchi Disabled</H3>

<P>
In the legislature, meanwhile, the opposition demanded an investigation
into whether the Social Services Minister misled the Legislature.
<P>
Last week, Tsubouchi said his ministry was reviewing the definition
of a disabled person under welfare regulations, but that no decision
had been made. 
<P>
The Liberals and New Democrats say government documents show the
government has already reviewed the issue, and has made a decision.
House speaker Allan McLean says he will review Tsubouchi's comments
to determine whether the Minister in fact did mislead the Legislature.
<HR>

<H3>Million Man March</H3>

<P>
Tens of thousands of black men gathered in the U.S. capital today
to enjoy the &quot;healing feeling&quot; of togetherness and to
dedicate themselves to helping each other and their families.
<P>
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan said he received divine
guidance in bringing the largest gathering of black Americans
to the capital since the 1963 march on Washington, D.C. 
<P>
The Million Man March had critics who cited Farrakhan's inflammatory
statements about Jews, Catholics, gays and Asians, but he brushed
them aside.
<HR>

<H3>Atonement March </H3>

<P>
In support of the Washington march, black men in Toronto held
their own day of atonement.
<P>
But the turnout was small. Dwight Ryan has that story.. 
<P>
<I>A rastafarian band played in a regent park community centre.</I>
<P>
<I>Their sounds signaled the beginning of Toronto's own million
man march.</I>
<P>
<I>But few turned out on this day of atonement or black holy day.</I>
<P>
<I>Still those in attendance were filled with enthusiasm.</I>
<P>
<I>Dudley Laws of the Black Action Defence Committee led the somber
march through the streets of Toronto to the Ontario Legislature.</I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Dwight Ryan, Channel 11 News.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Marleau-Clinics </H3>

<P>
Ottawa is now calculating penalties for those provinces which
allow private clinics to charge patients for medically necessary
services.
<P>
Health Minister Diane Marleau says she won't yield to provincial
arguments that such charges make up for federal cuts... and help
shorten lineups for health services.

<H4>Good Evening, I'm Jamie West,</H4>

<H3>Catholic Teachers</H3>

<P>
The province's 58 separate school boards have been advised to
defy a provincial law that ended their right to preferentially
hire Catholic teachers.
<P>
Last month the Catholic Trustees launched legal action, challenging
the Provincial law.
<HR>

<H3>Religious Demo</H3>

<P>
Representatives from a variety of religious faiths gathered at
Queens Park today to protest cuts to social services by the Harris
Government. 
<P>
The approximately 100 demonstrators from Anglican, United and
Catholic churches as well as Quakers and Buddhists, were a far
cry from some of the angry protesters that have been following
Premier Harris across the province. 
<P>
They call on the government not to make any more cuts to Welfare,
or other programs that help the poor. They say it isn't right
to cut the deficit on the backs of the most vulnerable.
<HR>

<H3>Dover Bikes </H3>

<P>
It's been a tradition with bikers since 1982. Every Friday the
13th, they get their motors running and head out on the highway
to Port Dover. 
<P>
The gathering usually takes on a festive mood, but this year police
were worried that biker gang violence might spill over into Dover....

<P>
<I>Just because it's Friday the 13th doesn't mean bad things will
happen. </I>
<P>
<I>Case in point ... Port Dover the small Lake Erie community
becomes home to these bikers every time this fateful date rolls
around. There's never been a problem before, but Provincial police
were worried that biker gang turf wars between Satan's Choice
and The Loners out of Toronto could erupt in Port Dover.. they
didn't want any scenes similar to ones like these in which firebombs
and booby traps were used to deliver messages.</I>
<P>
<I>But today Port Dover is anything but a war zone as for a beefed
up police presence... all we could find were a couple of cruisers
doing the circuit, and the officers on board were keeping quiet.
</I>
<HR>

<H3>Bosnia Cease-fire </H3>

<P>
The cease-fire in Bosnia- Herzegovina appears to be holding across
most of the country. 
<P>
But the fighting drags on in northwestern Bosnia... where things
are not going well for the Bosnian Serbs.
<HR>

<H3>Klein Award </H3>

<P>
He headed the team that designed Canada's first nuclear reactor.
...and for Hamilton's doctor George Klein that was just the beginning.
<P>
At a special ceremony in Ottawa today Dr. Klein became the 1995
inductee into the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame.

<P>
Meanwhile in Hamilton, reporter Marci Ien spent some time with
the doctor's sister, Margarete who shared some childhood memories
about her famous brother.
<P>
<I>When George Klein died at age 88 in 1992...he was called the
most productive Canadian inventor in the 20th century.</I>
<P>
<I>But to this woman he was a brother...and confidante...who was
always on the move....</I>
<P>
<I>While Margarete made her home in Hamilton... Doctor Klein worked
at the National Research Council in Ottawa ...where he stayed
for 40 years ...designing the NRC's first wind tunnels. </I>
<P>
<I>But Gearing Systems was his specialty. </I>
<P>
<I>In 1970...he was the chief consultant on an advanced gear design
for the Canadarm...the remote manipulator arm on the Space Shuttle.</I>
<P>
<I>But it was 1950 that he developed the device he was most proud
of...a motorized wheelchair for quadriplegics. </I>
<P>
<I>Miles away...a special ceremony is underway in Ottawa... Klein
will join the likes of Frederick Banting and Alexander Graham
Bell. </I>
<P>
<I>Marci Ien, channel 11 news.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Eagles Nest Settled</H3>

<P>
A 45-day occupation of the Federal Indian Affairs office in Brantford
ended peacefully today ... as six people occupying the government
office left the building this morning under terms of an agreement
with the six nations band council.
<P>
The protesters are members of the Mohawk Nation. They began the
occupation on August 30th and demanded the repeal of the Indian
Act and the resignation of the Band Council. 
<P>
Both sides accepted the terms of a special negotiating team and
a task force will now try to resolve the grievances of the occupiers.
<HR>

<H3>Pierre Berton </H3>

<P>
Last night was special for one of Canada's most popular men of
letters. 
<P>
They came to celebrate Pierre Berton. 
<P>
The 16th Annual International Festival of Authors is being held
in Toronto, and one of the highlights is a yearly tribute to the
life and literary accomplishments of a living Canadian author.

<P>
The much honored Berton, who hosted his own show on CHCH-TV in
the 1970s, is the author of 27 books. Among those paying homage
to the prolific writer were authors Margaret Atwood and Arthur
Hailey, as well as fellow broadcaster Charles Templeton. 
<P>
Even on this tribute night, Berton met issues head on.

<P>
Donna French and Debbie Mahaffey appeared today on the phone in

<P>
Lauran Sabourin has more in this report.
<P>
<I>This was the fourth television appearance made by these women
since Paul Bernardo was convicted of killing their daughters.
</I>
<P>
<I>A trial where the details of how Kristen and Leslie were brutalized
was emotionally devastating.</I>
<P>
<I>The impact made worse as they see it by an insensitive defense
team. Debbie Mahaffey admitted that even though she did not look
at the tapes. </I>
<P>
<I>A part of her wanted to see Leslie again. Even if it meant
watching her being brutalized. </I>
<P>
<I>Debbie and Donna appealed to the public to ignore the books
being written on Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka. </I>
<P>
<I>Callers all of them sympathetic to these women. just wanted
to tell them how sorry they were.</I>

<H3>Harris Re: Quebec </H3>

<P>
Ontario Premier Mike Harris hit the national unity trail today
to get Ontario's views across to Quebeckers before the Sovereignty
Referendum takes place at the end of the month.
<HR>

<H3>Harris - Kingston</H3>

<P>
Provincial Government cuts to programs and social services sparked
an ugly reaction in Kingston last night. 
<P>
Riot police were called to control an unruly crowd of about 200
angry protesters outside a posh golf-club. 
<P>
Firefighters also rushed to the scene after smoke air-conditioning
system and smoke seeped into the building.
<HR>

<H3>Loomis Robbery</H3>

<P>
Two Loomis guards were tied up and relieved of their guns during
a robbery at a bank machine in a suburban Toronto shopping centre
this afternoon. 
<P>
It seems there were no witnesses when the guards were tied up
in a small room behind a TD bank machine in the parking lot in
York Mills. 
<P>
Police won't say exactly how much money was stolen, but there's
word it was a considerable haul. 
<P>
Officers are interviewing the guards for leads in tracking down
the thieves.
<HR>

<H3>Sailor Dead </H3>

<P>
A sailor from a Canadian navy ship has died in an accident at
sea in BC's Juan de Fuca strait. 
<P>
The frigate, &quot;HMCS Regina&quot; was on replenishment exercises
with the &quot;Protectuer&quot; when the accident happened. 
<P>
A navy spokesman says it appears 25-year- old leading seaman James
Hauser was hit in the head by a piece of equipment. He died of
head injuries after being airlifted to hospital in Victoria. Hauser
was from Guelph and has family in Victoria.
<HR>

<H3>School shooting </H3>

<P>
The routine humdrum of high school was shattered today in one
small South Carolina town. 
<P>
Authorities say a student who was suspended just yesterday shot
a teacher, and then killed himself.
<HR>

<H3>Wilderness </H3>

<P>
Buffalo's Studio Arena Theatre has opened its 40th season with
Eugene O'neill's comedy-drama &quot;Ah, wilderness!&quot; 
<P>
Alex Reynolds attended the opening, and brings us this report
on the play....an imagined story of a boyhood the author never
had. 
<P>
<I>The essence of O'neill's work is wrought from the stuff of
his own life. </I>
<P>
<I>His was a torn spirit. He bitterly resented and inordinately
admired his father. While craving his mother's love desperately,
O'neill could not Overcome the feeling that she had failed him.
</I>
<P>
<I>The Nobel prize winner's play &quot;Long Day's Journey Into
Night&quot; documented the realities of the O'neill household.
</I>
<P>
<I>By contrast, &quot;Ah, wilderness!&quot; is O'neill's only
comedy, a front-porch, Fourth-of-July mood of nostalgic Americana.</I>
<P>
<I>The Miller family's holiday preparations are dismissed by their
teenage son Richard, who reasons they are all slaves of the capitalistic
system and the celebration is a stupid farce. </I>
<P>
<I>The play hints at rebellious youth even in 1906. </I>
<P>
<I>It has been said that Eugene O'neill never wrote a proper English
sentence. More devastating is the quip: &quot;he was a great playwright
who never wrote a good play.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>What O'neill gives us in &quot;Ah, Wilderness! Is a quintessential
turn-of-the -century image of the American family.</I>
<P>
<I>In Buffalo, Alex Reynolds, Channel Eleven News.</I>

<B>Good Evening, I'm Jamie West</B> 
<HR>

<H3>Tire Inquest Driver</H3>

<P>
Frustration today at the inquest into the runaway truck tire deaths
of two southern Ontario motorists. Angela Worona and James Tyrell
died in separate but almost identical accidents when truck tires
became detached from their rigs. 
<P>
As Marci Ien reports tonight, two Quebec mechanics have now refused
to testify...and other witnesses are blaming each other for the
tragedies. 
<P>
<I>All the families of James Tyrell and Angela Worona want are
answers. Answers that will tell them why their loved ones were
killed. But answers are hard to come by. </I>
<P>
<I>It was last January 31st that Angela Worona of Whitby was killed
by a runaway truck tire. ...a tire that crossed three lanes before
smashing through her windshield. No one has admitted putting on
that wheel. No one wants to take the blame. </I>
<P>
<I>But the jury has heard evidence that mechanics didn't follow
tire installation and maintenance procedures. ...procedures outlined
in this step-by-step instructional video. </I>
<P>
<I>Meanwhile, the Quebec-based mechanics who installed the tire
that flew off a rig killing 31-year- old James Tyrell of Mississauga
have refused to testify at the inquest. </I>
<P>
<I>Jean Lemrye was the driver of the truck in the Tyrell accident
...he says that just nine hours before...he had brought it in
to a Quebec repair shop for an air leak in a tire ...the same
tire that would become separated from his truck ...cross six lanes
and hit James Tyrell's car last April 3rd...killing him instantly.
</I>
<P>
<I>Another note ...Lemyre...a truck driver for 20 years...told
the inquest he had never seen a torque wrench before... experts
have testified that the tool is the safest to use when securing
wheel nuts and bolts. two of the nuts on Lemyre's truck were upside
down and had no washers. </I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Marci Ien, Channel 11 News.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Demo-Law Suit</H3>

<P>
A group of people who were injured during a demonstration at Queens
Park on October 4th are taking the police to court. 
<P>
On that day more than five thousand people picketed Queens Park
to protest government cuts to social services. At one point the
crowd rushed the building..and some of the demonstrators were
injured in a melee with the police. 
<P>
Today four of those people told a Queens Park news conference
they are suing the police for brutality.
<HR>

<H3>Runciman-Crime </H3>

<P>
The politician responsible for law enforcement in Ontario says
he tends to believe police rather than Stats Canada when it comes
to crime statistics. 
<P>
Statscan figures show crime is down in Ontario. But Metro Toronto
police say the opposite is true. Solicitor General Bob Runciman
says there has been a rise in certain types of crime. 
<HR>

<H3>Employment Equity </H3>

<P>
The Harris government moved today to strike down the former NDP
government's Employment Equity legislation. It means no more job
quotas. 
<HR>

<H3>Harris-Referendum </H3>

<P>
Ontario Premier Mike Harris wants to set the record straight on
what this province's views are about what Canada's and in particular,
this province's relationship would be with Quebec, should the
&quot;yes&quot; forces win the referendum. 
<P>
Harris says Ontario's views are being Harris-referendum 
<P>
Tomorrow, Premier Harris, along with Liberal Leader Lyn McLeod
and NDP Leader Bob Rae will speak on Canadian unity at a downtown
Toronto hotel.
<HR>

<H3>Eves Funeral </H3>

<P>
Political differences were set aside last night during a memorial
in Parry Sound. 
<P>
Premier Mike Harris, Liberal Leader Lyn McLeod and NDP Leader
Bob Rae sat side by side at the funeral service for Justin Eves.
He's the son of Ontario Finance Minister Ernie Eves.
<P>
More than 6-hundred people packed a Parry Sound church for the
service. 
<P>
Justin Eves was killed in a car crash on the weekend. 
<HR>

<H3>O.J. Invu Nixed</H3>

<P>
NBC has announced that tonight's scheduled interview with O.J.
Simpson has been canceled. 
<P>
Tom Brokaw says Simpson's lawyers decided they could no longer
abide by the network's no-holds-barred ground rules. 
<P>
It was to be Simpson's first interview since being found not-guilty
on murder charges.
<P>
NBC says it had been swamped with phone calls from angry viewers.

<HR>

<H3>NDP Results </H3>

<P>
The race for National Leader of the New Democratic Party now has
an official front- runner. 
<P>
That distinction goes to former MP Lorne Nystrom, with 45-percent
of votes cast by the party faithful in the national primary. Svend
Robinson has 32 percent, while 18 percent of voters chose Alexa
Mcdonough. so its now a three way race, with Herschel Hardin eliminated.

<P>
But delegates who actually pick the new leader this Saturday are
not bound by the primary. 
<HR>

<H3>Gas Competition </H3>

<P>
Don't be surprised if someone knocks on your door offering you
a deal on natural gas. 
<P>
Deregulation means anyone can sell the commodity...and now residential
customers are being targeted. as Dwight Ryan reports, we may soon
be able to shop around for the best deal on Hydro. 
<P>
<I>Chances are your gas bill is smaller than usual this month.
In fact, many bills from Union Gas indicate a credit. The utility
says lower costs for natural gas are being passed on to the customer.
But many customers are making their own deals. Taking up offers
from private companies now selling natural gas door to door.</I>
<P>
<I>Toronto lawyer Peter Budd represents some of these private
companies..known as agents, brokers and managers...or ABM's. </I>
<P>
<I>Deregulation came to the Natural Gas industry ten years ago
this month. Factories, schools and hospitals often buy from private
companies. Now residential customers are being targeted. </I>
<P>
<I>Tom Adams of Energy Probe believes direct purchase is the way
of the future. it seems skyrocketing utility bills will soon be
a thing of the past ..thanks to deregulation.</I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Dwight Ryan, Channel 11 News.</I>

<B>Good Evening, I'm Jennifer Mossop</B> 
<HR>

<H3>Somalia-Tuesday</H3>

<P>
A former commander of the Canadian Airborne Regiment says the
commandos should never have been sent to Somalia. 
<P>
This from Colonel Walter Holmes at the Somalia inquiry in Ottawa
today. He said he was fighting discipline problems in the unit
just a year before its deployment to Somalia. 
<HR>

<H3>Privatization </H3>

<P>
The Ontario government is looking at privatizing many of its services.
Management Board Chair, Dave Johnson says the Harris Tories will
do whatever it takes to downsize government and save money. 
<HR>

<H3>Tsubouchi-Snitches </H3>

<P>
A group calling itself the &quot;Underground Calling Committee&quot;
says it is trying to jam up the Province's Welfare snitch line
by flooding the number with bogus calls. The one-800 number encourages
people to report Welfare fraud. However, Social Services Minister
David Tsubouchi says the ploy is not working.
<P>
A government study released last year found that there isn't much
welfare cheating going on. Even in apparent fraud cases..less
than one per-cent was found to be genuine. 
<HR>

<H3>Harris-Eulogy</H3>

<P>
As we reported yesterday, the 23-year-old son of Ontario Finance
Minister Ernie Eves died tragically in a car crash over the weekend.
<P>
In the Legislature this afternoon, Premier Harris conveyed a message
from Justin Eves' mother. 
<HR>

<H3>Liu Suspect</H3>

<P>
A suspect in the murder of a Markham woman is in critical condition
after shooting himself while being questioned by police. 
<P>
When officers investigating the death of Georgina Liu tried to
arrest the man, he fled and shot himself. 
<P>
The name of the 28 year old suspect has not been released. He's
expected to recover. 
<P>
Liu's body was found this weekend along Highway 401 in Mississauga.

<HR>

<H3>Quake Aftermath </H3>

<P>
The death toll from yesterday's earthquake along Mexico's Pacific
Coast has jumped to at least 56. 
<P>
Hundreds were injured in the quake, which hit 7.6 on the Richter
Scale. 
<P>
It also cracked bridges, split highways and cut power and phone
services. 
<P>
Those 54 dead are from two states containing some of Mexico's
most popular beach resorts. 
<P>
In Manzanillo, a resort 530 kilometres miles west of Mexico city,
the seven-storey Costa Real Hotel was reduced to rubble.
<HR>

<H3>Amtrak Wrap</H3>

<P>
FBI agents are looking for more evidence of sabotage in a one-mile
square area around the site of the derailed Amtrak train in Arizona.

<P>
The Sunset Limited derailed 55 miles southwest of Phoenix yesterday.
One person was killed, and 78 injured. 
<HR>

<H3>Toyota Expansion </H3>

<P>
Cambridge received another economic shot-in- the-arm today, as
Toyota started producing made- in-Canada engines for its Corolla
line. That means 50 more jobs... and still more in a couple of
years.

</UL>

<P>
<B>Good Evening, I'm Jennifer Mossop</B> 
<HR>

<H3>Bernardo </H3>

<P>
Justice Patrick Lesage has reserved his decision on whether Paul
Bernardo should face a dangerous offender's hearing, and further
sentencing in the murders of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffey.

<P>
Crown Attorney Leslie Baldwin wants the judge to keep alive seven
of nine counts Bernardo was convicted of, and permit a hearing
to determine whether Bernardo is a dangerous offender. That label
would mean Bernardo could be kept behind bars indefinitely. 
<P>
The defence wants the judge to stay all but the murder convictions
in the Bernardo case, scrapping the dangerous offender application.

<P>
Meanwhile, Justice Lesage allowed john Rosen to quit as Bernard's
lawyer today. Tony Bryant is taking over amid complaints that
Ontario's legal aid fund will not guarantee payment. Mr. Justice
Lesage will hand down his written decision in a week's time. After
that, Rosen will officially step aside as Bernard's lawyer of
record. 
<HR>

<H3>French Interview </H3>

<P>
Now that Paul Bernardo has been convicted of first degree murder
Kristen French's parents Doug and Donna French have decided to
speak out about the justice system.
<P>
In an extended interview with Lauran Sabourin the French's had
high praise for the police but disdain for the way they were treated
by the court.
<HR>

<H3>Johnson Cuts </H3>

<P>
The Harris government has cut another massive chunk of spending.

<P>
About 400 programs in every area of government will have to make
do with 772-million dollars less. 
<P>
As Marci Ien reports from Toronto, the cuts have opposition calling
for the Premier's resignation.
<P>
<I>Blaming an inflated deficit the Tory ax has once again swung
fast and furious. 772 million dollars in cuts ...not one Provincial
Ministry spared. The Tories had vowed not to cut health care programs..
but now it seems tough times mean nothing is sacred. </I>
<P>
<I>There will be a 20-million dollar cut to hospital cash transfers
...and a 3 point one million dollar cut to related facilities.</I>
<P>
<I>Also on the chopping block ...two AIDS-related programs...one
for HIV assistance and the other for AIDS prevention. And social
activists say women have been hit especially hard...and the cuts
continue ...gone is a half million dollar TV ad campaign ..aimed
at stopping violence against women ...a victim-witness assistance
program will be trimmed by 40-thousand dollars...a wife-sexual
assault program by 153-thousand. </I>
<P>
<I>Gail Picco is on the board of directors at Interval House ...a
haven for women and children trying to escape abusive relationships.</I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Marci Ien, Channel 11 News.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Murder </H3>

<P>
Provincial police are offering a 25-thousand- dollar reward for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killer
or killers of a Scarborough man. 
<P>
The partially decomposed body of 41-year-old Balachandran Ponniah
was discovered last January in Puslinch Township. 
<P>
He had been missing for about three months... and was shot twice
in the head. His car was found abandoned near Woodstock.
<HR>

<H3>California Fires </H3>

<P>
In California tonight... firefighters are reporting dramatic headway
in putting out a massive wildfire north of San Francisco. The
blaze has burned 11-thousand acres along northern California's
most scenic seashore.
<HR>

<H3>Miss Oktoberfest </H3>

<P>
Miss Oktoberfest has been crowned at the annual beer and sausage
bash in Kitchener-Waterloo. 
<P>
She's 24-year-old Paulette Schier of Snellville, Georgia. Schier
is not new to the pageant game. She's also Miss Georgia USA.
<P>
She will serve as an ambassador for the fest, the largest Bavarian
bash in North America.
<P>
The 1995 Oktoberfest officially began at noon today with the opening
of the first beer keg at Kitchener's City Hall. Schier will appear
at about 45 events over the next year and will also visit the
festival in Bavaria.

<P>
<B>Good Evening, I'm Jennifer Mossop</B> 
<HR>

<H3>Homolka Petition</H3>

<P>
A petition containing three hundred thousand names, from across
Canada, is calling for an independent inquiry into the plea bargaining
arrangement made for Karla Homolka, for her part in the murders
of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffey.
<P>
Boxes containing over 10-thousand pages of names were wheeled
through the halls of Queens Park today, to the office of Etobicoke
West Tory MPP Chris Stockwell. He later sent the petitions across
the floor of the Legislature to Attorney General Charles Harnick.
<P>
The five women who spearheaded the petition say Harnick has the
power to extend the time for an appeal of Homolka's 12 year sentence
for manslaughter. But Attorney General Harnick says he cannot
interfere with the Homolka case because it is connected to the
continuing charges against Paul Bernardo.
<P>
Prosecutors are asking that Bernardo, who was convicted of first
degree murder of the two girls last month, be declared a dangerous
offender. He still faces charges for a string of rapes in Metro
Toronto.
<HR>

<H3>Jail Closures </H3>

<P>
Ontario's Solicitor General has confirmed there is a proposal
in his ministry to close possibly seven jails in the province.

<P>
The lists includes correctional centres in Lindsay, Peterborough,
Stratford, Chatham, and Fort Frances. Bob Runciman says no decision
will be made without talking to the local communities involved.
<HR>

<H3>Ref. Thursday </H3>

<P>
Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau has taken aim at Quebec business
people who speak in favour of a united Canada. 
<P>
He says Quebeckers have been exploited by billionaires, and developed
an inferiority complex because of it. As a result, he says they
can no longer see their own strengths. 
<P>
Parizeau admits that he's been asked to be more aggressive in
the referendum campaign... and the tone is changing on the &quot;no&quot;
side as well.
<HR>

<H3>Opal Wrap</H3>

<P>
The sun is shining brightly on the Alabama/Florida gulf coast
today, highlighting the destruction left by Hurricane Opal. 
<P>
Hundreds of homes are leveled, or washed away, roads are flooded,
and trees uprooted.
<P>
And we're now experiencing high winds and rain... it's all part
of the remnants of Hurricane Opal.
<HR>

<H3>Pope Wrap</H3>

<P>
Pope John Paul the Second addressed the United Nations General
Assembly today. His visit is to highlight the importance of the
UN as it celebrates its 50th anniversary.
<HR>

<H3>Tires-Tyrell Family </H3>

<P>
More questions today concerning the competence of workers in the
tire industry. 
<P>
An inquest into the death of two southern Ontario drivers killed
by runaway truck wheels, has heard from the wheels manufacturer.
William Noll of Accuride Corporation has testified that tire installers
viewed a step-by-step instructional video detailing wheel removal
and replacement. But Noll says some procedures were not followed.
<P>
This, eight months before, a motorist was killed.
<P>
31-year old Angela Worona of Whitby was killed instantly last
January when a tire became detached from a truck on the 401, and
smashed into her windshield.
<P>
Two months later, 31-year old James Tyrell of Mississauga, died
in a similar accident on the QEW.

<B>Good Evening, I'm Jennifer Mossop</B> 
<HR>

<H3>Hurricane Opal </H3>

<P>
Florida's North Gulf Coast has girded itself for the strongest
hurricane to threaten the region since Camille menaced the shore
in 1969. Hurricane &quot;Opal&quot; is just south of Pensacola
now. The powerful storm is belting the gulf coast with 200- kilometre-an-
hour winds and driving rain. 
<P>
Thousands of people have evacuated coastal areas, seeking safety
inland. states of emergency have also been declared in Florida,
Louisiana and Alabama.
<P>
Forecasters say that although &quot;Opal&quot; has weakened slightly
... it is now a category three hurricane... it is still powerful
enough to do severe damage.
<P>
And our area will not be spared... the remnants of Hurricane Opal
are expected to arrive in the lower lakes by tomorrow night in
the form of high winds and rain. A warning is in effect.
<HR>

<H3>Bill 40 </H3>

<P>
True to its word, the Harris Government started the ball rolling
toward repealing Bill 40 today.
<P>
Among other things, the controversial law banned the use of strike
breakers during a legal work stoppage.
<HR>

<H3>More Tire Inquest</H3>

<P>
An expert witness at the inquest into the flying tire deaths of
two southern Ontario drivers says it's time to enforce formal
training for tire installers. Mike Axworthy says certification
is one way to get unsafe trucks off the road. Marci Ien reports.
<P>
<I>There are more trucks on Ontario's highways than ever before...and
for motorists that means more danger.</I>
<P>
<I>Last January 31st...31 year old Angela Worona is killed instantly
when a flying tire detaches from a tractor trailer ...ricochets
off the 4-0-1 guardrail and smashes into her windshield.</I>
<P>
<I>A couple months later...James Tyrell the driver of this car
suffers a similar tragedy on the QEW.</I>
<P>
<I>Earlier the jury heard testimony from serviceman Peter Arsenault
who said truck wheels should be checked for cracks, rust, and
worn-out studs. </I>
<P>
<I>A considerable amount of rust was found on the wheel that killed
Angela Worona. But Mike Axworthy says after the fact ...it's hard
to pin-point exactly what caused the accident.</I>
<P>
<I>Testimony concerning the death of James Tyrell last April is
expected to be heard on Thursday.</I>
<P>
<I>In Toronto, Marci Ien, Channel 11 News.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Fiery August Crash </H3>

<P>
A driver involved in a fiery crash that killed three people in
Scarborough last August had a blood-alcohol level more than three
times the legal limit. 
<P>
Two young men and a young woman from Pickering were burned beyond
recognition when the vehicle slammed into a pole on Steeles Avenue
near Reesor Road on August 27th.
<P>
Dental records were used to identify the three victims. metro
Toronto police say forensic tests on the body of the driver, 22-year-old
Michael Joseph Battle of Pickering, revealed the high blood-alcohol
level.
<HR>

<H3>Simpson Juror </H3>

<P>
One of the jurors who decided that OJ Simpson wasn't guilty says
racial considerations did not enter into the verdict. And Brenda
Moran told reporters that she had serious doubts surrounding the
&quot;bloody glove.&quot;
<HR>

<H3>Pope</H3>

<P>
Hundreds of Catholics gathered in and around a cathedral in Newark,
New Jersey today... as Pope John Paul the Second arrived to start
a five-day U.S. tour. 
<P>
During his stay, the Pontiff will visit both the wealthy power-elite
and the poorest of America's poor. he'll also speak at the U.N.'s
50-th anniversary celebration, and celebrate outdoor masses in
New York, New Jersey and Baltimore.

<B>Good Evening, I'm Jennifer Mossop</B> 
<HR>

<H3>Simpson Acquitted</H3>

<P>
Orenthal James Simpson is a free man tonight. Just after one o'clock
this afternoon, a court clerk read the verdict that had been reached
last night... and sealed until the time chosen by Los Angeles
Superior Court Judge Lance Ito.
<P>
The &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict came as a shock to some and
a relief to others. 
<HR>

<H3>Buffalo-Simpson</H3>

<P>
Buffalo was watching the O.J. verdict today with intense interest.
The former football star is a living legend in that city. And
many people believe that O.J. committed the murders but they are
relieved that he was acquitted.
<HR>

<H3>401 Truck Mess</H3>

<P>
Just one day after the start of an inquest into runaway truck
tires, there has been another incident of a big rig losing its
wheels. This morning a transport truck, hauling a pup trailer
went off the side of the road on highway 4-0-1, near Mississauga
road.
<P>
The axle and wheels on the pup trailer apparently flew off and
went through a guard rail and into a ditch.
<HR>

<H3>1/2-way Houses Axed</H3>

<P>
A bombshell from Queen's Park today...it was learned that the
Harris Government will close all 25 half way houses in the province.
And the Solicitor General also announced he will be instituting
an electronic monitoring program for low risk offenders.
<HR>

<H3>Hydro Freeze</H3>

<P>
Also from the Harris Government .... a five year freeze on Ontario
Hydro rates. Energy Minister Brenda Elliott says the move was
precipitated by threats from some large industrial consumers as
well as municipal utilities to buy their electricity from other
suppliers. 
<P>
There is a catch, however. The minister revealed the freeze applies
to the average rate over the five year period. So rates could
vary from year to year. The minister is also calling on municipal
utility companies to also hold their costs to hold consumers down
as well.
<HR>

<H3>Cable-Court</H3>

<P>
A Toronto man is in court today on behalf of all cable subscribers
to do battle with Rogers cable.
<P>
Keith Mahar is the director of a new consumer awareness group
called Cable Watch..... and as Marie Adsett reports he is urging
everyone to question what they are really paying for when they
pay their cable bill.
<P>
<I>The issue is not negative billing ... it is something that
cable consumers may not even be aware of ..according to Keith
Mahar it is the result of an agreement between the CRTC and cable
companies. ....since January part of your monthly cable bill has
been given to a fund to support Canadian programming. The real
issue for Mahar is not the mandate of the fund but whether consumers
are being treated fairly ... Mahar says he has lost faith in the
system and has started a consumer awareness group called Cable
Watch.</I>
<P>
<I>The issue could take weeks or months to resolve but in the
meantime he hopes people will become more aware of their rights
as consumers. </I>
<P>

<P>
<B>Good Evening, I'm Jennifer Mossop</B> 
<H3>Tire Inquest </H3>

<P>
There has been a rash of flying truck tire incidents across the
province over the past year.
<P>
Tires becoming detached from their vehicles, and ricocheting into
busy traffic. 
<P>
Two of those episodes have resulted in death, and as Marci Ien
reports tonight, an inquest at a Toronto hotel into those deaths
will hopefully bring recommendations to make our highways safer.

<P>
<I>That car was 31-year-old Angela Worona's. hit by a flying truck
tire on the 401...it was thought to be a million-to-one freak
accident...until a few months later...when tragedy struck again...James
Tyrell...also 31 dies in a similar accident...this time on the
QEW. </I>
<P>
<I>The accidents prompted highway safety blitzes, calls for stiffer
fines and tougher truck regulations. </I>
<P>
<I>The victim's sister says the government is still not doing
enough. A jury of three men and two women listened to the evidence
surrounding the cases...and watched computer-animated re-enactments
of the wheel crashing into Angela Worhona's car on the 4-0-1.
</I>
<P>
<I>Patricia Harmon ...a nurse ...driving behind the truck in question
last January 31 was one of the first to take the stand ...she
says that two tires flew off the truck ...one of them right in
front of her...it hit the guard rail and then crashed into Worhona's
car. The truck driver didn't realize what happened said Harmon...and
she flagged him down with the help of another motorist. </I>
<P>
<I>Wooley says the two nuts were so loose he could undo them with
his fingers. </I>
<P>
<I>The inquest is expected to last three weeks. At that time the
five member jury is expected to come up with recommendations.
Recommendations that will hopefully make our highways safer. Marci
Ien, Channel 11 News.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Toronto Homicide </H3>

<P>
Metro Toronto homicide detectives say suspicious circumstances
surround the death of a vagrant whose lifeless body was discovered
by a passer-by this morning on Sumach Street, south of Queen Street
East.
<P>
The dead man had suffered injuries that caused blood loss ...
but the coroner's office is awaiting the results of forensic testing
before making a final cause of death determination. The victim
has been identified as 60-year-old Sandor Szent Tuha. 
<HR>

<H3>Simpson Today</H3>

<P>
The O.J. Simpson jurors asked to hear some testimony read back
to them today... that of limousine driver Allan Park... who took
Simpson to the Los Angeles airport the night Simpson's ex-wife
and Ronald Goldman were killed. 
<P>
The request suggests the jurors are considering whether Simpson
had enough time to commit the murders... then get home in time
to catch the limo.
<HR>

<H3>Terror Trial</H3>

<P>
The convicted leader of a New York terror ring has been transported
to Missouri for evaluation.
<P>
Doctors plan to evaluate Omar Abdel-Rahman's health.. and then
decide which prison he will be housed in. The Egyptian Sheik and
nine followers were convicted Sunday in New York of plotting to
blow up a number of U.S. landmarks.
<P>
A jury also found them guilty of conspiring to kill the President
of Egypt. 
<P>
In Egypt, the Sheik's son expressed shock and sorrow at the decision.
<HR>

<H3>Snitch Line </H3>

<P>
Back home... Queen's Park wants you to snitch on your neighbours.
They've set up a Welfare fraud snitch line... but opposition members
of the legislature are calling it a bumper-sticker approach to
the problem.
<HR>

<H3>Birth Clinics</H3>

<P>
The Harris Government has dumped a pilot project which would have
seen birthing centres set up in Toronto, as well as Saint Jacob's
near Kitchener, and Sudbury. 
<P>
The organizations setting up the clinics say they can't understand
the government's logic... since birthing clinics reduce by half
the cost of delivering babies. 
<HR>

<H3>Parked Cars </H3>

<P>
Thousands of shiny new cars, destined for delivery in the U.S.,
are jamming parking lots in Fort Erie.
<P>
The cars aren't being allowed across the border into Buffalo because
of a four-week-old strike by drivers at the largest car transport
company in the U.S. 
<P>
More than three- thousand vehicles are being stored in the Fort
Erie lots, including one at the fort Erie racetrack.
<P>
Some dealers in Western New York and Pennsylvania say they are
facing dwindling supplies.
<P>
About five-thousand members at Ryder Systems in the U.S. went
on strike September 7th. 
<HR>

<H3>Swingers</H3>

<P>
A London swingers' group says it will hold a convention some time
in October. 
<P>
&quot;Choices&quot; says it won the right to use the city's convention
centre a couple of weeks ago. The centre's board of directors
approved a policy that allows any group whose activities are legal
to rent the centre. 
<P>
&quot;Choices&quot; is based in London, but the convention is
sponsored by swingers clubs in Michigan, Ohio and St. Louis. 
<P>
Swingers engage in extra-marital sex through spouse swapping.

<CENTER><H1>Crime Stoppers #709: Drinking and Driving</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3>Originally broadcast the week of December 23, 1996</H3></CENTER>
<HR>


This week, Crime Stoppers is focusing on a very important issue - drinking and driving.
<P>
With the holiday season here, Crime Stoppers is asking for each 
and everyone to take special care.  It is extremely important that 
each of us be aware of the many accidents and fatalities that are 
caused by persons who drink and drive.
<P>
So far this year, the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Service 
has stopped over 43,000 vehicles in their RIDE program.  It is 
important to realize that RIDE lanes are set up throughout the region 
everyday to deter people from drinking and driving.
<P>
During this past year, Operation Lookout, a program sponsored by 
the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police, the Hamilton 
Automobile Club, (A.D.D.) Against Drunk Driving and the Ministry 
of the Attorney General has been responsible for removing 72 
drunk drivers off the road.  This high profile year-round public 
awareness campaign encourages the public to report impaired 
drivers to police.  Citizens are asked to call 911 and provide 
the police with the location of where they saw the impaired 
driver, including a vehicle and driver description and the 
direction of travel.  People are cautioned not to attempt to stop 
the vehicle.
<P>
You can be the eyes for the police when they don't see the crime 
in progress,  Call 911 and ensure that your safety is not 
jeopardized.  With your help, the police will be one step closer to 
achieving their goal of eliminating the problem of drinking and
driving in our community.
<P>
<H3>Crime Stoppers of Hamilton-Wentworth wishes each and everyone 
a very happy and safe holiday.  And please don't drink and drive.</H3>

Last February, Margaret Ricci was struck and killed by a hit and run
driver.  Now, Crime Stoppers is asking for the public's assistance with
information about the person responsible.
<P>
On Sunday, February 18, 1996, two women went out for a pre-dawn
walk on Upper Wellington Street.  In the area of Howe Ave., Margaret
Ricci stepped from the sidewalk and decided to walk along the edge
of the roadway.
<P>
A pick-up truck, travelling north on Upper Wellington in the curb lane,
struck Ms. Ricci.  This truck continued on without slowing down or
stopping.  Margaret Ricci died as a result of injuries sustained from the
accident.
<P>
Forensic tests of black paint chips taken from the scene have
determined the vehicle involved to be a 1987-1991 full-sized Ford
pick-up.  This vehicle may have been two-tone, with one of the colours
being black.  There would have been damage done to the front end.
<P>
The driver is believed to be male, white, about 30 years of age.
<P>


<H3>If you have any information about this hit and run accident, or information
on any other serious crime call Hamilton-Wentworth Crime Stoppers
at (905) 522-TIPS. That's (905) 522-8477 to be eligible for a
cash reward of up to $1,000.

<HR>


Crime Stoppers and the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police need your 
help in solving a brazen day-time robbery.
<P>
On October 18, 1996, at 2:15pm, the owner of Judy's Hairdressing Salon 
at 90 Melvin Ave., Hamilton, was roughed up and had her change purse 
stolen.
<P>
A young man walked into the salon from the street and asked the female 
owner where her money was.  He then went over to a partially opened 
cash drawer and discovered that it had no money.  The suspect then 
lunged for the owner's purse that was on a nearby chair.  A shoving and 
pushing match ensued as he tried to 
search through the purse.  During the struggle, the owner poured a cup of pop 
over the suspect.  He became enraged and pushed her to the floor. 
The robber then grabbed her change purse and ran out of the store.  He was 
last seen running eastbound on Melvin Avenue.
<P>
Police are looking for a man described as white, 25-30 years old, 5'5", thin 
build, dark brown moustache, wearing a flourescent baseball cap with a dark 
coloured rim, dark coloured winter bomber jacket, blue jeans and white 
running shoes.
<P>


<H3>If you have any information concerning this robbery, or information about any 
other serious crime, call  Hamilton-Wentworth Crime Stoppers
at (905) 522-TIPS. That's (905) 522-8477 to be eligible for a
cash reward of up to $1,000.

not have to reveal your identity. Crime Stoppers does not subscribe

Crime Stoppers of Haldimand-Norfolk and Tillsonburg needs you help to solve an armed robbery which 
occurred at the Pioneer Gas Bar on Argyle Street North in Caledonia.
<P>
On Monday, August 26, 1996, at approximately 4:00a.m., a lone male entered the kiosk and threatened 
the attendant.
<P>
The suspect was wearing a black and white tartan shirt over a faded black or grey sweatshirt and a hood.  
The attendant pulled the hood off the suspect.  The suspect immediately covered his face and ran to the 
back corner of the gas station parking lot where he met another male; this male was wearing a similar mask 
and a light grey sweatshirt.  He was holding a black garbage bag which the suspect suggested was a gun.  
He threatened to shoot the attendant.  The first suspect returned to the kiosk, this time wearing his shirt around 
his face.  He also indicated that he had a gun and threatened the attendant twice, &quot;I have a gun.  I'll shoot 
you.&quot;  He entered the kiosk, took the money from the register, ran to the back of the lot and left the scene 
between a shed and a neighbouring church.  The second suspect followed.
<P>

Crime Stoppers and the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police need you help in 
solving a theft of band equipment with a value of over $15,000.00.
<P>
On Friday, July 21, 1996, sometime after 4:00p.m., thieves took band equipment, 
involving a set of Yamaha drums, various amplifiers, mixers, microphones and a 
Seiko guitar tuner from a storage area on the second floor of a building at 582 
Barton Street East, Hamilton.

The building had been the site of a weeklong move of another business in the 
same storage area.  The band equipment was still intact at the end of that move 
on Friday, July 21, 1996 at 4:00p.m.  It is believed that the thieves were aware of 
the band equipment, entered the building and stole it shortly afterwards.  Police 
believe that someone must have seen the thieves loading this equipment 
into a truck.
<P>

<H3>If you have any information about this theft or information about any 
other serious crimes call  Hamilton-Wentworth Crime Stoppers

<HR>


Expensive fur coats were the target of professional thieves who broke into
an Ottawa Street store.  Now Crime Stoppers is asking for your help with 
information on the persons responsible for this crime and other similar 
thefts in the Toronto area.
<P>
On Sunday, November 19, 1995, just after 8:00pm, a neighbour noticed
three males in the alleyway at the rear of Nadel Furs, located at 281 
Ottawa Street North, Hamilton.  The three suspects were standing beside a 
car and a van, which were parked near the rear door of Nadel Furs.
<P>
A short time later, the thieves pryed open the rear door using two 
crowbars that were left at the scene.  Once inside, the culprits went to the 
more expensive coats and quickly removed about 100 fur coats from the 
racks.  Some of the furs had Nadel Furs labels on the inside lining, while 
others had customer initials on the inside lining.  The store alarm was set off 
and the thieves quickly left prior to the police arriving.
<P>
One suspect is described as male, white, 30-35 years with short dark hair 
with bangs across his forehead, moustache, husky build and possibly of 
European decent.
<P>
The other two suspects appeared to be younger and thinner than the first 
suspect.
<P>
One vehicle seen at the rear of the store is described as a newer model 
dark green mini-van, possibly a Chrysler.  The other is described as similar 
to a K-Car, with a dark bottom and beige roof.


<P>
<H3>If you have any information about this theft or information about any 
other serious crimes call  Hamilton-Wentworth Crime Stoppers
at (905) 522-TIPS. That's (905) 522-8477 to be eligible for a
cash reward of up to $1,000. 
<P>
Remember, in all cases, you will
not have to reveal your identity. Crime Stoppers does not subscribe
to Call Display.</H3>

<HR>


Crime Stoppers and the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police need your help in
solving a robbery involving a purse snatching.
<P>
On Thursday, September 19, 1996, at 12:30pm, a woman in her 60s, was
knocked to the ground and her purse ripped from her shoulder as she was about
to enter her parked car on the Centre Mall parking lot.
<P>
The woman is a cashier for a nearby business and she had just received some
money for this company at a bank in the mall.  She had placed the money
in her purse and was returning to the car when she was attacked.  A man came
up to her from behind and pulled on the strap of her purse so severely that the
purse strap broke and the woman fell to the ground.  The man ran away with
the purse, with the victim chasing after him.  She lost sight of him as he turned the
corner at the east side of the Sears store.  Witnesses saw this man get into a
beige, rusted Tempo and it drove off with someone else driving.  The victim
suffered bumps and bruises.
<P>
The robber is described as a white male, 5'4", mid 20's, slim build, dark hair,
possibly a moustache, wearing a baseball cap.


<P>
<H3>If you have any information about this robbery or information about any 
other serious crimes call  Hamilton-Wentworth Crime Stoppers

<HR>

It has been over three years but Niagara Regional Police
investigators are still trying to solve a very tragic and disturbing
crime.
<P>
On Sunday, May 16, 1993, a Niagara Falls resident was fishing
along the gorge on the Canadian side of the river.  At around 10:30a.m.
the angler saw what appeared to be a doll floating in the whirlpool.
The fisherman was able to retrieve this object which turned out to
be a deceased infant female.  After extensive investigation by
Canadian and U.S. authorities, the identity of the child has not
been established.
<P>
It has been determined that the baby was a healthy, full-term
newborn and the cause of death appeared to be drowning.
<P>
A portion of the umbilical cord was still attached to the baby and the
way it had been cut indicated the birth was not medically assisted
and was likely a home delivery.  It is possible that the body had
been in the water up to two weeks before being discovered.

<P>

<H3>If you have any information about this homicide, or information
about any other serious crime, call Niagara Crime Stoppers at 1-800-263-8477 or 
Hamilton-Wentworth Crime Stoppers
at (905) 522-TIPS. That's (905) 522-8477 to be eligible for a
cash reward of up to $1,000.

<HR>

Once a store has closed for the day, employees usually feel safe and
relaxed.  Two Oakville cashiers found out the hard way that this is
not always the case.
<P>
At 9:25pm, Thursday, June 13, two staff members at Oakville's 
Wal-Mart in the Trafalgar Villiage Mall on Cross Ave., has closed
their tills and started walking toward the store's office.  As they 
passed the washrooms, a man exited the men's room with his face 
covered and brandishing a handgun.  He grabbed at the cash bags
they were carrying and struck one of the victims with the weapon as
he struggled for the bags.  Once he got some of the bags away from
the employees, he ran out the emergency exit to the west side
parking lot for the mall.
<P>
Responding police officers included one with a tracking dog, but the
suspect could not be located.
<P>
The culprit sought by police is described as male, white and 5'6" tall.
He wore a black covering over his face, a black shirt, black pants and 
black gloves.
<P>


<H3>If you have any information about this robbery, or information
about any other serious crime, call Halton Crime Stoppers at 1-800-668-5151 or 
Hamilton-Wentworth Crime Stoppers
at (905) 522-TIPS. That's (905) 522-8477 to be eligible for a
cash reward of up to $1,000.

<CENTER><H1>Crime Stoppers #685: Attempted Purse Snatching, Hamilton</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3>Originally broadcast the week of July 8, 1996</H3></CENTER>
<HR>

An attempted purse-snatching turned violent when the young
robber was unable to grab and break free with a woman's purse.
Now, Crime Stoppers is hoping that someone can provide information
about this suspect.
<P>
On Friday, June 21, 1996, at 4:00pm, a woman was a victim of an attack
on the parking lot by the Canadian Tire and Ultra Mart stores at the
corner of Mohawk Road and Upper James Street, Hamilton.   After
shopping at the Ultra Mart, she was standing at her vehicle getting
the keys out when the suspect ran past her and grabbed her purse,
which was slung over her shoulder.  The woman was pulled forward
as he tried to pull the purse free.  The victim grabbed his arm and 
pulled back and both fell to the ground.  He continued to pull at 
her purse.  She grabbed her sandal and struck the culprit in an 
attempt to make him let go.  He punched her in the mouth.  She 
responded by striking him repeatedly until he let go.  He fled on
foot without the purse.  The sandal had two heavy buckles on the 
front and inflicted injuries to the suspects face causing heavy bleeding.
<P>
The suspect is described as a male youth, white, between 13 and 17 years,
5'5", with a thin build.  He has dark brown hair, cut short on the sides and
back, cut long on top with bangs.  He wore an oversized black t-shirt
and baggy pants.  He may have injuries to his face such as a swollen
nose, black eye or cuts.

<HR>
This week, Crime Stoppers is asking for your assistance in identifying
those persons responsible for recent thefts in the Brantford and
Dundas area.
<P>
Sometime between the evening of Thursday, May 30th and Friday,
May 31st, 1996, someone entered the equipment compound
belonging to Cooper Cranes at 15 Papple Road, Brantford Township.
<P>
Once inside the compound, the suspects removed four metal pans
which are used to distribute the weight of a large crane's outriggers
where they are in contact with the ground.  These devices stabilize
the crane and prevent it from overturning when the boom is in use.
<P>
Each of these metal pans weigh almost 200lbs.  They are imprinted
with the words &quot;American Hoist and Derrick&quot;.  The four pans are
valued at $25,000.  Investigators are also looking at a similar theft
which recently occurred in Dundas.

<P>

<H3>If you have any information about these thefts, or information
on any other serious crime, call Brantford Crime Stoppers at 1-519-752-7867 or 
Hamilton-Wentworth Crime Stoppers
at (905) 522-TIPS. That's (905) 522-8477 to be eligible for a
cash reward of up to $1,000.

<CENTER><H1>Crime Stoppers #683: Greenhouse Break-In, Dundas</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3>Originally broadcast the week of June 24, 1996</H3></CENTER>
<HR>

A Dundas business has been victimized five times over a one month
period.  Now, Crime Stoppers is hoping someone will provide
information to identify the persons responsible.
<P>
Sometime during the early morning hours of Wednesday, April 17,
1996, thieves went to the Ben Veldhuis Greenhouses, located at 154
King Street, Dundas.  The culprits forced open a door to gain entry
into one of the rear greenhouses.  Once inside, they proceeded to
remove 17 high pressure sodium lights.  These lights are worth almost
$6,000.00.
<P>
This was the fifth time the greenhouses had been broken into.  Each
time, the thieves stole these high pressure sodium grow lights.  Police
speculate the thieves would use these lights to set up a hydroponics
for growing marijuana.
<P>
The business has now installed an alarm system to deter any
future thefts.


<P>

<H3>If you have any information about this theft, or information
about persons growing marijuana, call Hamilton-Wentworth Crime Stoppers
at (905) 522-TIPS. That's (905) 522-8477 to be eligible for a

On Thursday, March 14, 1996, at about 8:00pm, a man obtained cash

demanding his money and wallet.  The victim dropped his money and 
wallet to the ground and was ordered to step back, turn around, and 
walk away.

and a blue zippered sweat shirt.
<P>
The suspect is described as male, 15 to 20 years old, 5'7", 130 lbs.  He was
unshaven with stubble on his face and chin.  The weapon was a very 
old &quot;ACE1&quot; 22 calibre bolt action rifle in poor condition.  The handle
had been painted black with some red showing as well.

Police believe that suspects who broke into a west Hamilton nightclub had
prior knowledge about the lay-out and the security system inside of
the club.
<P>
Just around midnight on Sunday, March 24, 1996, a vehicle pulled
up to the side of the Crowbar NightClub located on Main Street West
and Rifle Range Road, Hamilton.  Two men got out of a vehicle and ran
to the back of the building.  The suspects were able to climb up the 
side of the building to the roof.  The culprits then smashed one hole in
the roof, directly above the office area.
<P>
The thieves climbed down to the office area and stole some cash.
They then made their way to a storage room and removed electronic
equipment including high tech laser lighting.  The thieves then left by
the front door, setting off the alarm.
<P>
Police believe that the suspects had previous knowledge of the
layout of the bar as the hole in the roof was directly above the office.
Also, the thieves took great care in not going into any of the areas of
the building that were alarmed.
<P>

In February, Margaret Ricci was struck and killed by a hit and run
driver.  Now, Crime Stoppers is asking for the public's assistance with
information about the person responsible.
<P>
On Sunday, February 18, 1996, two women went out for a pre-dawn
walk on Upper Wellington Street.  In the area of Howe Ave., Margaret
Ricci stepped from the sidewalk and decided to walk along the edge
of the roadway.
<P>
A pick-up truck, travelling north on Upper Wellington in the curb lane,
struck Ms. Ricci.  This truck continued on without slowing down or
stopping.  Margaret Ricci died as a result of injuries sustained from the
accident.
<P>
Forensic tests of black paint chips taken from the scene have
determined the vehicle involved to be a 1987-1991 full-sized Ford
pick-up.  This vehicle may have been two-tone, with one of the colours
being black.  There would have been damage done to the front end.
<P>
The driver is believed to be male, white, about 30 years of age.
<P>

<CENTER><H1>Crime Stoppers #672: Brantford - Highway Homicide</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3>Originally broadcast the week of April 8, 1996</H3></CENTER>
<HR>


Two years ago this week, a truck driver was shot and killed on the 403 Highway
near Brantford.  This week, Crime Stoppers is asking for your assistance to solve
this murder.
<P>
Michael Lovejoy, age 35, was a resident of Flint, Michigan.  He was married with
two sons, and was employed as a truck driver for &quot;RTS Transport&quot;.
<P>
On the evening of Thursday, April 7, 1994, Lovejoy left the GMC truck plant in Pontiac,
Michigan around 11:15pm.  He was driving a white GMC Tractor which was pulling a white 
freight van.  Both were marked with the letters &quot;RTS&quot; in blue.
<P>
Lovejoy crossed the Canadian border at Sarnia and drove through Southern Ontario arriving
in Buffalo, New York shortly after 10:00am the next morning.
<P>
He picked up a shipment of truck axles and came back into Canada at Niagara Falls just
after noon.  Sometime between 1:30pm and 1:45pm, Lovejoy pulled his rig onto the westbound
gravel shoulder of Highway #403, just east of the Park Road overpass in Brantford.
<P>
Later that night, another RTS driver spotted the parked transport truck and tried to contact
Lovejoy over the CB but received no answer.
<P>
This same driver was returning through Brantford on Saturday, April 9, 1994, and noticed that
Lovejoy's truck was still parked at the side of the highway.  He stopped to investigate and found 
Michael Lovejoy's body in the sleeper portion of the cab.  He had been shot several times.  
Robbery does not appear to have been a motive.
<P>

<H3>If you have any information on this murder, or information
on any other serious crime call Brant Brantford Crime Stoppers at (519) 752-7867 or 
Hamilton-Wentworth Crime Stoppers
at (905) 522-TIPS. That's (905) 522-8477 to be eligible for a
cash reward of up to $1,000. Remember, in all cases, you will
not have to reveal your identity. Crime Stoppers does not subscribe

<P>
This week Crime Stoppers is asking for your help in identifying
suspects responsible for breaking into the manager's office at
three apartment buildings and believed to be responsible for other
similar crimes in the city.
<P>
On Thursday, February 1, 1996, two suspects broke into the apartment
buildings located at 140 Robinson Street, 90 Duke Street, and
187 Park Street South, Hamilton.
<P>
At the entry to #90 Duke Street, one suspect gained entry to the
underground parking area and then forced open the bay garage door.
 The second suspect drove a car similar to a 2-door, dark coloured,
Turismo into the underground parking lot.  They then made their
way from the basement to the first floor manager's office.
<P>
As they were leaving the underground parking area, one of the
suspects took a large screwdriver and smashed the lens of the
camera that had videotaped their entry to the building.  These
same suspects were captured on videotape at entries to two apartment
buildings that same night.
<P>
There is no description of the driver; however, his accomplice
is described as male, white, 30-35 years, medium build, he has
dark shoulder-length wavy hair and a thick moustache.  He was
wearing a dark hooded coat that had a small emblem on the left
front, and a large emblem on the back.
<H3>If you have any information on these entries, or information
on any other serious crime call Hamilton-Wentworth Crime Stoppers
at (905) 522-TIPS. That's (905) 522-8477 to be eligible for a

markets.  Furthermore, it has brought forth its captioning policies
to television broadcasters, government and the community at large.

hearing groups and potential captioning sponsors.  Its goal is
to keep each of these markets informed as to what is happening
in the captioning industry.

<HR>

<H3><CENTER>Ethical Entrepreneur</CENTER> </H3>

<P>
It's a sorry fact of our society that ethics and profit too seldom
mix and that charity and enterprise are often considered mutually
exclusive concepts.  It takes an exceptional individual with focused
energy, tireless creativity and true humility to direct the entrepreneurial
drive towards communal good.  Those are exactly the qualities
behind <A HREF="cci.htm">Canada Caption Incorporated's (CCI)</A> founder and Executive
Director, Beverley Ostafichuk.
<P>
Born of profoundly deaf parents, Ostafichuk learned at an early
age to be aware of and sensitive to the challenges faced by disabled
people, particularly those who are deaf and hard of hearing. 
Her work as a producer and publicist at various Canadian broadcast
networks and stations made her acutely conscious of the gap between
the needs of the deaf and hard of hearing community and the services
provided by established broadcasters and captioning facilities.
<P>
Able to move between the medium and challenged masses, Ostafichuk
formed <A HREF="lobco.htm">LOBCO Inc.</A> to assist Canadian broadcasters in implementing
captioning product and policy.  She then founded CCI in 1992 with
a mandate to increase the amount and improve the quality of captioning
of Canadian television programming by underwriting the associated
costs.  In doing so, Ostafichuk also formulated a revolutionary
model for charitable organizations with equal parts altruism and
business acumen.
<P>
&quot;We're a charity but also a business,&quot; Ostafichuk states
unequivocally.  &quot;Most charities are labour-intensive.  They
recruit hundreds of people to go to hundreds of doors and beg.
 I prefer to run CCI as if it were a private organization and
wanted to make money.  And we do...But we spend it all in charitable
ways.  There's nothing wrong with being a charity that doesn't
have to worry about where it's going to get a dime for a photo
copy or a long distance phone call.
<P>
Ostafichuk attributes her professional philosophy in large part
to Pierre Levasseur, Chairman of the Canadian Captioning Development
Agency.  &quot;He took me under his wing and taught me how to
be an ethical entrepreneur,&quot; she says.  &quot;As he has demonstrated
throughout his life, you can succeed financially while operating
within a moral code.&quot;
<P>
Ostafichuk has surrounded herself with independent and innovative
thinkers, and spends much of her time troubleshooting and creating
new opportunities for herself and her staff.  One of the foremost
authorities on captioning in the world, she is also exporting
her knowledge and the CCI model to anyone, anywhere, who is willing
to take note.  A wife and mother of two, Ostafichuk maintains
an exemplary balance between humanitarian concerns and material
self-sufficiency, and has established herself as an exceptional
corporate citizen and a visionary for charitable organizations
of the future.<HR>

<P>
With over twenty years experience in business and sales, Norm
brings a wide range of skills to his position as Vice President
of Sales and Marketing.  Educated with a Bachelor of Landscape
Architecture degree from the University of Toronto, and business
courses at Sir Wilfred Laurier School of Business Norm relies
largely on experience and searches for practical solutions.  From
running his own business at the age of 17, to receiving national
sales awards, to syndicating and managing real estate investment
portfolios, Norm has flourished with each challenge.  In all ventures
Norm readily gained a thorough understanding of the business and
moved quickly to ensure growth and prosperity.
<P>
Norm joined LOBCO Inc. in March 1996 as a sales representative
to introduce their newly released product, <B>VoiceWriterTM</B>.
 His position has quickly expanded and Norm has assumed the roles
as sales manager for all products and services within the organization.
 With three separate divisions and a growing sales force Norm
now manages the sales of <B>VoiceWriterTM</B>, for LOBCO Inc.,
a real-time captioning sponsorship service with CCI, and an off-line
captioning service with The Caption Clearinghouse.
<P>
What was largely a research and development company during the
last three years, Norm is helping to guide the organization through
its transition to the next level where it offers a full line of
products and services.  &quot;Expanding in all three areas simultaneously
is imperative.&quot;  We have many more products and services
we want to add to reinforce the organization's primary objective
of captioning 100% of programming going to air by the year 2000.&quot;

<HR>

<P>
Captioning is an electronic process which converts the audio position
of a television program into written words.  These words usually
appear at the bottom of a television screen with decoding capability
or through a peripheral decoder.  Unlike subtitles, captions are
designed specifically for the deaf and hard of hearing, in addition
to on-screen dialogue, sound effects and off-screen nuances that
are significant to a particular scene may also be described.
<P>
Captions appear on line 21 of the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI)
- the black horizontal bar between individual television images
- at a rage of about two characters per frame, or 60 characters
per second.  While a normal speaking rate in English is about
200-250 words per minute, a comfortable reading rate is only 102-140
wpm.<HR>

<P>
Like foreign language subtitles, Open captioning appears on the
television screen automatically, without the aid of the additional
technical devices that make Closed captioning appear.
<P>
There are two technologies used for Closed captioning programs.
 For Offline or post-production captioning, editors determine
wording, timing and placement for captions after a program is
complete and wed the captions to the final cut prior to broadcast.
 Real-time captioning uses stenographers who transcribe live programs,
such as news or sporting events, as they are broadcast.  A sub-standard
of Real-time is a process called Live Display which allows scripted
portions of a live program to be fed into a computer for translation
into captions, but omits any spontaneous or unscripted segments.

<H1><CENTER>The Cost of Captioning</CENTER></H1>
<HR>

<P>
In Canada, captioning a television program costs up to $1000 per
hour.  For deaf and hard of hearing television viewers, decoders
are available as a special service from some local cable companies
for a nominal deposit.  The retail cost of decoders range from
$125 to $270 CND. for viewers with hearing difficulties.
<P>
The US Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1993 requires all television
sets thirteen inches and larger to have built-in closed captioning
decoder circuitry.  Canada has no domestic television manufacturing
capability and has benefited from &quot;The Chip Law&quot;.  Sheer
production volume has minimized the additional cost of specialized
circuitry per set.<HR>

<H1><CENTER>The Captioning Audience</CENTER></H1>
<HR>

<P>
According to the Canadian Hearing Society, ten percent of the
Canadian population experiences some form of hearing impairment
and about two percent is profoundly deaf.  These people, who have
been estranged from telecommunication by virtue of their disability,
were in impetus for captioned television.  However, captioning
is expanding into other audience segments.
<P>
With the greying of the Baby Boomers, the percentage of Canadians
with hearing problems is expected to rise to approximately 30
percent, making it increasingly important to service those individuals
who rely on or prefer alternate forms of communication.  Furthermore,
educators have discovered that captioning can help to encourage
and enhance word recognition, reading skills and comprehension
in children.  Captioning provides similar gains to the nearly
five million functionally illiterate Canadians;likewise, new Canadians
benefit while familiarizing themselves with the idioms and idiosyncrasies
of language and pop culture.

<P>
In May 1996, LOBCO Inc. President Beverley Ostafichuk and Technical
Director Erwin Rivera traveled to Colombia for two weeks to investigate
their current captioning technology. A government organization
- Instituto Nacional Para Sordos, (INSOR) - invited the LOBCO
Inc. consultants to study the broadcast industry, policies and
government regulations in order to provide access to the Colombian
deaf and hard of hearing population.<BR>

<P>
While in Colombia we met with representatives of the Department
of Education, Department of Communication, Vice President's office,
and representatives from the senate. All were very responsive
to the presentations and wanted more information on how this industry
could be created.
<P>
We also gave two days of workshops, where we worked at length
with representatives of the television broadcast industry and
post production industry. The results of these activities proved
fruitful as they began to understand that captioning was not just
about providing the hard of hearing access to television, but
also about creating new revenue streams where they otherwise would
not exist.
<P>
People who attended were from the broadcasting industry, deaf
and hard of hearing organizations, government offices, universities,
institutions, and the private sector. The purpose of the workshops
were to explain what captioning is in both general and practical
terms. What was discussed and explained in more detail was Television
Broadcast Technology and Captioning, Captioning Styles and Method,
Social Policy and Law, Advocacy, Secondary Markets and the Business
of Captioning. Part of these full day workshops were spent demonstrating
the VoiceWriter Off-line Captioning System.<BR>

<P>
In addition to the positive reaction received from these workshops,
LOBCO Inc. visited universities and other post-secondary institutions
that were fascinated with the technology, the potential partnerships
for customized research and development for the Spanish language.
The fresh curriculum that would no doubt attract students interested
them also, as the potential for employment is promising.
<P>
On two occasions INSOR took us to meet with the deaf and hard
of hearing community. In these instances we spoke to this community
at a social gathering, where the highlight was to watch closed
circuit television where sign language was used to discuss various
sporting events which had occurred that week.<BR>

<P>
The deaf and hard of hearing community fully support the introduction
of captioning as a way of access to television. In the numerous
presentations that were made, one question came up on a consistent
basis - &quot;Deaf are at the low end of the economic scale. These
people generally do not read. What good, therefore, is captioned
television if they are illiterate?&quot;<BR>

<P>
Because sign language is different from English or Spanish, a
deaf person comes to written Spanish almost as a Spanish-as-a-Second-Language
reader. This means they would have trouble reading the captions
at first, picking up a word here and there. However, studies and
practical experience in North America have proven that the deaf
learn to read very quickly and efficiently, becoming literate
as a result of captioning.<BR>

<P>
The deaf only differ from others in that they are unable to hear
the world around them. In North America, statistics have shown
that people prefer to receive their news on the television rather
than the newspaper. Per capita, the television industry is growing
as viewers come to depend on television as their primary source
of information. This is true also for the hearing impaired.<BR>

<P>
Another question that often arose was, &quot;How can one benefit
from captioning if they are so poor that they do not have access
to television?&quot; LOBCO Inc. is an entrepreneurial organization
which specializes in captioning and cannot answer this type of
question. What they did learn, was through INSOR and FENASCOL,
two key participants in the deaf and hard of hearing community
in Colombia, that the deaf community does have access to television
and would therefore also have access to captioned television.
<BR>

<P>
Captioned television will provide a passive approach to learning
literacy for the deaf and hearing illiterate. Illiterate or not,
the population enjoys watching television, and the Colombian government
has an opportunity to teach its general population literacy at
a minimal cost.
<P>
As an organization that is basically a distribution site for content
providers, the ability to grow into a full fledged broadcast operation
requires new funds that currently do not exist. Captioning is
one way in which revenue could be created to be further used for
new programming.
<P>
Currently in Colombia there is no existing captioning industry.
In South America, Brazil has discussed the possibility, but requires
expertise and technology to take the next step. This leaves an
opportunity for Colombians to be the first in South America to
provide captioned programming to its population, creating industry
where it has never existed before. Colombia could then export
its expertise to other South American countries, creating an even
larger and multi-national captioning industry.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=1>By Pino Jazbec<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
CHCH-TV, Channel 11 in Hamilton is pleased to announce an agreement
with The Caption Clearinghouse, (TCC) of Oakville that should
see CHCH-TV become the first television broadcaster in Canada
to close caption its entire days programming. Reg McGuire, CHCH-TV's
Executive Vice-President and General Manager, states that, &quot;this
was too good of an opportunity to turn down. The Caption Clearinghouse
is the first company to offer a comprehensive plan to achieve
such goals.&quot;<BR>

<P>
The financing for such a venture will be entirely funded by a
corporate sponsorship program that TCC has been using to caption
thousands of hours of television programming. TCC President, Norman
Scott-Trask, says &quot; this method is nothing new and has been
used by our organization and other broadcasters for over five
years.&quot; While the broadcast community has been moving steadily
to increase the amount of programming that is captioned, progress
has been slow. With the cost of captioning high, broadcasters
have been very selective in deciding which programs will be captioned.
This, however, will be the first serious attempt to develop a
comprehensive system with established parameters and guidelines
to assist in raising the necessary funding to ensure that all
programs aired will be captioned.<BR>

<P>
The real challenge is not to caption programs but to find innovative
ways to provide this service without being viewed solely as an
added liability by broadcasters. It is very easy to caption all
programming claims Scott-Trask, &quot;Just throw money at it.
But nobody, not even the end users, expect or want this industry
to be simply a charitable gesture, and it doesn't have to be.&quot;
And who would know better than TCC, a company whose activities
cover the entire spectrum in the captioning industry, including
the sales of corporate sponsorship, captioning programs, the development
and marketing of advanced computer captioning technology and international
consulting.<BR>

<P>
TCC believes that captioning is only in its infancy and that very
soon, all programs will be captioned, and not just for the aid
of the hearing impaired. &quot;The captioning industry has tremendous
growth potential into many areas, and we intend to develop them
&quot;, claims Scott-Trask. &quot; That's why I believe we have
the best chance of achieving CHCH's objective of captioning 100%
of its programs. We are entirely focused on captioning, and unlike
the broadcaster, nothing else will distract us from our challenge.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
The Canadian Radio-Television Communications Commission, (CRTC),
has set targets for all broadcasters to close caption up to 90%
of all news programming by September 1998 and 90% of all programming
by 2002. The agreement between CHCH-TV, Channel 11 and TCC will
exceed these requirements in both the amount of programming captioned
and the time required to accomplish this. TCC has targeted in
this agreement, to reach 100% of programs captioned by June of
next year.<BR>

Another year has come and gone and we are looking forward to next
year's festivities. We have many, many broadcasters, cablecasters
and deaf and hard of hearing organizations to thank for their
participation in Captioning Awareness Week, May 27 - June 2, 1996.
<BR>

<P>
One such organization is Newfoundland Co-ordinating Council on
Deafness, (NCCD), who took up the challenge to participate during
CAW '96. Several deaf and hard of hearing organizations were asked
to submit a proposal for any event they would like to organize
to get the public involved and made aware of the importance of
closed captioning, not only for the deaf and hard of hearing but
for English as a second language learners and for the promotion
of literacy for all ages. NCCD was awarded $500.00 seed money
for their proposal to participate by holding a Mayor's breakfast
at City Hall, May 28th and the Legislative Breakfast at the Newfoundland
Hotel on May 29th.<BR>

<P>
Beverley Ostafichuk, Executive Director of Canada Caption Inc.,
appeared live on Breakfast Television (Citytv) on May 27th bringing
the benefits of captioning to the public eye, which is still an
unknown commodity to some folks. Oakville's local community newspaper,
The Oakville Beaver, carried a half page story on Captioning Awareness
Week. Our publicist sent out press kits, which included our press
release &quot;Turning up the Volume with Captioning Awareness
Week&quot;. <BR>

<P>
Our PSA originally donated and created by DDB Needham Worldwide
Ltd. for CAW 1994 was graciously updated by Rogers Cablesystems
and literally played over and over again during Captioning Awareness
Week by countless broadcasters and cablecasters. Canada Caption
would like to thank you. CTV took the challenge again to put the
satellite feed out on two separate occasions for all broadcasters
to pick up the signal. CCI sends out their sincerest thanks. Thank
you to Comprehensive Distributors who dubbed our PSA and sent
out copies to all those who had trouble picking up the PSA off
the satellite feed. Without the kindness and generosity of people
and organizations such as these, Captioning Awareness Week would
literally not happen.<BR>

<P>
Many broadcasting stations aired open captioned programming during
CAW '96. The list went out with the Press Kits at that time. We
would be remiss if we didn't mention other broadcasters that open
captioned programming but were missed at the time of publication.
<BR>

<P>
Cable Parliamentary Channel, (CPAC) open captioned approximately
eighteen hours of programming during CAW. Of that, eleven hours
were in English, 1.5 hours in French and the remaining were bilingual.
An outstanding example of participation by CPAC. Some of the programming
open captioned were a captioning question period in French, captioning
scrums, some of the Westray Hearings, a press conference by Minister
of Fisheries, Brian Tobin and a press conference by Minister of
Transport, Doug Young.<BR>

<P>
ShowCase Television open captioned &quot;Street Legal&quot; at
2:00pm and 8:00pm May 28th.<BR>

<P>
CKPR/CHFD, Thunder Bay Television open captioned an episode of
&quot;Coach&quot; May 28th, and the June 1st episode of &quot;Murder
She Wrote&quot;.<BR>

<P>
The New VR in Barrie, Ontario open captioned &quot;Baywatch Nights&quot;
May 29th and employed their news as an excellent method of promoting
open captioning.<BR>

<P>
Those others who open captioned and were mentioned at the time
of publication of Captioning Today and in the press kits briefly

<P>
The Golden Cup Awards 1996 were outstanding. Held in Ottawa this
year, at the Radisson Hotel, Ottawa Centre on May 28th the event
went off with one small hitch, the Golden Cup awards were not
available for presentation. The missing cups didn't dampen the
enthusiasm of Canada Caption Inc.'s, Executive Director, Beverley
Ostafichuk who made light of what could have been a sticky situation,
and the winners who were gracious and understanding of having
to wait to receive their Golden Cup.<BR>

<P>
We knew from the moment we arrived at the Penthouse to set up
for the event and saw the spectacular view of Ottawa and the professional
set-up of our reception that we were in for a perfect evening.
<BR>

<P>
Those attending numbered approximately forty, arriving from the
broadcasting community, representatives of the deaf and hard of
hearing organizations, government institutions and representatives
of the corporate sponsorship community.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Michael McCabe, President and CEO, of Canadian Association
of Broadcasters in Ottawa spoke on their behalf as the very first
winner of the Golden Cup Awards' newest category in Special Recognition.
Mr. McCabe is quoted:<BR>

<P>
&quot; your association (CCI) does something that is very important
.....It's obvious it is important to the benefit of the hard of
hearing as a country, as a whole, that there is a part of the
population to contribute fully to the country....But I think as
an industry [we] have always recognized that we have to play our
role in making that possible.&quot;<BR>

<P>
The CBC won the National Broadcaster category for the third year
in a row. Mr. Gerald Flaherty, V.P. General Counsel for the CBC,
stepped in for Mr. Perrin Beatty, President and CEO who could
not attend. In accepting their award Mr. Flaherty said:<BR>

<P>
&quot;In times of financial restraint with the CBC I would like
to acknowledge the assistance of Canada Caption. Seeking out corporate
sponsors whose financial assistance made some of our captioning
possible... Sports fans will be interested to know that amongst
the programs captioned as a result of recruitment of sponsors
by Canada Caption are Hockey Night in Canada and Blue Jays Baseball.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
Rogers Cablesystems Ltd. were the recipient of the Golden Cup
in the National Cablecaster category. Ray Skaff, National Manager
of Captioning Services for Rogers, spoke on their behalf and had
this to say:<BR>

<P>
&quot;On a personal note, I've had an excellent opportunity over
the past year, to work with Beverley and the rest of the Canada
Caption gang with their support and some advice from them...I'm
pleased to say that by the fall every one of the Rogers community
television stations in Canada will be doing some sort of captioning
for the deaf and hard of hearing and I think a lot of that goes
to Beverley for her guidance and support in helping us out with
it and we are also very happy to be involved with them.&quot;

<P>
The Newfoundland &amp; Labrador Association of the Deaf, (NLAD)
recently worked in partnership with the Newfoundland Co-ordinating
Council on Deafness, (NCCD) in an effort to promote Captioning
Awareness during the week of May 27 - June 2. Thanks to a seed
grant from Canada Caption Inc., we were able to cover the cost
of printing for the posters. The posters which encourages &quot;100%
captioning by the Year 2000&quot; were distributed to every department
of the Provincial and Federal governments and to all municipalities.
In addition, they were sent to TV stations and local hospitals
to promote captioning. Nowadays, the TV's in the hospital waiting
rooms are equipped with captioning so that deaf outpatients can
enjoy watching TV.....<BR>

<P>
The NLAD is pleased to report, that after some lobbying of the
CRTC to have the local evening news closed captioned, CBC broadcast
the first captioned news program on February 5, 1996. Deaf and
hard of hearing TV viewers in our province now find the news much
more rewarding. An interesting fact is that the broadcasting runs
via a satellite link between Calgary and St. John's. To date,
it's proven to be second to none.<BR>

<P>
NLAD/NCCD will continue in their efforts to push for captioning
of all local news programs and for Captioning Awareness Week next
year, [and will keep encouraging] the local news to provide open
- captioning.<BR>

Thanks to a grant from Rogers Communications, Canada Caption Inc.
will host Captioning Awareness Week and the Golden Cup Awards
again this year. CAW is the single most important event that CCI
organizes. This year CAW runs from May 27 - June 2, and as in
previous years many broadcasters will open caption certain programming
(see list on page 7), in an attempt to broaden people's awareness
of the benefits of closed captioning. The highlight of this years
event will be the Golden Cup Awards reception on May 28th. The
Golden Cups are to captioning what the Oscars are to the movie
industry. 
<P>
The format for this years event will be a slight change from other
years. First of all the venue for the reception was changed from
the traditional Toronto area location to the Radisson Hotel in
Ottawa. This change of venue will enable many notable members
from the CRTC to be present.
<P>
At this years reception a new Golden Cup will be handed out. Both
Industry Canada and Canadian Association of Broadcasters have
been nominated to receive the first ever Special Recognition Award.
Other nominees include Mary Frances Laughton of Industry Canada,
Harold Wesley of CTV and Ellery Hollingsworth of CBC in the Humanitarian
category, BCTV, Citytv and Global Television Network for Regional
Broadcaster. Life Network, ShowCase and WTN for Specialty Channel.

<P>
Golden Cups for Advertising Agency, Corporation, National Broadcaster
and National Cablecaster will also be awarded.
<P>
Good luck to all nominees and lets all have a great Captioning
Awareness Week.

<P>
If you want to learn how to cook, travel the world, or see a heart
transplant, odds are you can find it on a Specialty Channel. But
how about a channel dedicated to horses, comedy or even space?
These are just a few of the 40 applications to the CRTC for this
years round of Specialty Channels.
<P>
Over 20 Canadian deaf organizations from coast to coast were represented
in the Canadian Association of Captioning Consumers (CACC) intervention.
CACC's mandate is to see all broadcasters, specialty or not, commit
to 100% captioning by the year 2000.
<P>
&quot;Our intervention was primarily based on CRTC policies and
procedures already in place&quot;, said CACC President Ellen Rusi.
&quot;We wrote in support of all applicants striving to meet policies
#1995-48 and 1987-27&quot;.
<P>
Policy #1995-48 requires all broadcasters earning more than 10
million dollars to caption all local news programming by September
1st, 1998 and 90% of all programming by the end of the license
term. Policy #1987-27 requires all licensees to install a TDD/TTY
within the first year of their license term.
<P>
Additionally, the intervention asked the CRTC to further clarify
#1995-48 as it relates to Specialty Channels. Currently, all news
channels would be required to caption all news programming by
September 1, 1998, while a comedy channel with no news would not,
other than their commitments made in their application, have to
caption 90% until well into the 21st century. 
<P>
On Wednesday May 22, CACC will appear at the CRTC hearing to state
our concerns and answer any questions that may arise. CACC will
continue to work with consumers, suppliers and the policy makers
of captioning to ensure the best quality of captioning is maintained.

Good day to all our readers. The sun is surging through thinly
veiled clouds after cold, wet months of early spring, and it raises
our hopes for a warm balmy spring leading on to May and June.
Situated out in southern Vancouver Island, I can make claim to
the fact that I experienced a quaking earthquake. I wouldn't wish
for the REAL one - they say it is due to happen, however, I need
to be prepared for IT.
<P>
I cannot help make a mental comparison to what we, the staff at
CACC, have so far accomplished but still have far to go by the
year 2000. We have endeavored and still are endeavoring, to endorse
closed captioning as part of our mainstream lives. To get 90 -
100% captioning in all Canadian broadcasts by year 2000, we need
to prepare ourselves for the difficult struggle, the bumpy roads
and hassles to mark our goal. We're here to reap the rewards of
our hard labor and the principle we stand by. The BIG DAY is anticipated,
whether it be the earthquake or the day we enter the new century.
Will we in Victoria crumble down in our earthly land or will caption
consumers fail to literally convince broadcasters to give us our
due? It's in the preparation that will make or break for all of
us caption users.
<P>
CACC has been preparing for interventions on Specialty Channels
seeking licensing rights with CRTC this spring. As well, it is
anticipated Captioning Awareness Week will occur May 27 - June
2. Then there's monitoring to be set up, oh yes, we have to be
watchdog, too.
<P>
What are you doing to help CACC promote or protect captioning
in Canada?

<P>
Supporting Canada's disability industry is good business.
<P>
Two recent events have brought that message home loud and clear
for Industry Canada: a ministerial announcement and participation
at a major international conference and trade show.
<P>
In February, federal Industry Minister John Manley announced that
his department will continue to recognize the importance of Canada's
emerging disability industry through the formation of the Assistive
Devices Programme Office. The Office will serve as a focal point
for contact in Industry Canada on issues dealing with disability
and the industries that serve this community.
<P>
In March, the Office hosted some of its industry partners in a
exhibition booth at the California State University, Northridge
(CSUN) conference, &quot;Technology and Persons with Disabilities&quot;.
With an annual attendance of 5,000, CSUN, which is held in Los
Angeles, is the largest conference of its kind in North America.
<P>
Industry Canada's booth partners this year were The Betacom Group,
which demonstrated technologies for people with visual disabilities;
Aroga, whose closed circuit television system for classroom/meeting
use will assist people with low vision to get an enlarged view
of what is going on around them; Slipstream Software Systems,
which has developed a modular, collaborative project-planning
software called CoPlanner; and LOBCO Inc., whose VoiceWriterTM
Off-line Captioning System is light-years ahead of other broadcast
captioning systems currently in use.
<P>
For the companies who shared space in the Industry Canada booth,
CSUN provided the chance to gain exposure to an international
audience. Business contacts were made and there were also plenty
of opportunities to see first-hand what new products and services
are coming on the market. Everyone from government officials to
marketers and manufacturers to general consumers attended the
three-day conference. Because CSUN attracts such a diverse audience,
exhibitors gain a better perspective on the public's needs and
wants in assistive technologies.
<P>
Some exhibitors were demonstrating alternative communication methods
for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. These new devices,
which marry computer and telecommunications technologies, could
mean for example, that affordable and flexible alternatives to
using TTY's will soon become more commonplace.
<P>
Many of the small and medium-sized companies that make up the
bulk of Canada's assistive technology industry would find renting
and staffing their own CSUN booth prohibitively expensive. But
Industry Canada provides them with exhibit space in which our
partners can demonstrate their systems and devices. In an exhibit
hall where all the other booths were surrounded by dark blue curtains,
Industry Canada's red backdrop, proudly displaying the Canadian
flag, was easy to spot and it drew a lot of visitors.
<P>
Such high visibility gave our partners a little extra help in
making those all-important contacts. The 1996 conference was only
the third time the department has hosted a booth at CSUN. One
of last year's occupants, a Newfoundland company called Compusult,
has since &quot;graduated&quot; to being able to rent its own
booth for this year's show. In fact, Compusult was our next door
neighbour!
<P>
Besides the Industry Canada booth contingent, there were about
a dozen Canadian companies and organizations strutting their stuff
in Los Angeles. Some of these were companies we have also worked
with on development projects and they've gone on to gain a foothold
in domestic and foreign markets.
<P>
After the first full day of the conference, we and our partners
hosted a wine and cheese party, to which we invited Canadians
attending CSUN, plus the heads of some of the largest assistive
technology companies in the US, Europe and elsewhere. This provided
everyone with a chance to make potentially profitable contacts
in a relaxed social setting. It was also a great way to unwind
and show that Canadians know how to mix business with pleasure!
<P>
The Assistive Devices Programme Office plans to host a booth at
CSUN again next year. We will once again invite Canadian small
businesses to join us there, where they can check out the competition,
demonstrate their innovative systems and products and maybe set
the stage to become bigger business.
<P>
Industry support through such activities as this makes Canada
the envy of our American neighbours. More than once during the
course of each day, I heard representatives from US companies
and organizations say, &quot;I wish we had a government outfit
like yours to help us get our foot in the door.&quot;
<P>
It's nice to be wanted!

VoiceWriterTM, a recently released turnkey solution for non-linear
off-line closed captioning was launched at the NAB conference
and show in Las Vegas, and according to Peter McKinnon, an independent
consultant from the Nordicity Group of Ottawa &quot;this is another
example where Canadian technology is second to none&quot;.
<P>
LOBCO Inc. of Oakville, Ontario, and the developer of VoiceWriterTM,
was one of many Canadian companies demonstrating quality ingenuity
and technology. Beverley Ostafichuk, LOBCO Inc.'s president, proudly
reported &quot;this show is crucial and VoiceWriterTM has generated
even more enthusiasm than we imagined&quot;. She went on to say
&quot;it fulfilled our primary mandate to build the best possible
system to ensure quality captioning is available for the broadcast
community.&quot;
<P>
Beginning on April 14 and running through to the 18th, the international
broadcasting community descended on Las Vegas, the capital of
glitz and glamour and made it's presence felt. It's hard to imagine
a city that exists solely to entertain, and one that entertains
millions of tourists and convention hordes annually would even
notice. But NAB is a huge event, even by Vegas standards, as over
90,000 visitors from all over the world were reported to have
attended this event staged solely to demonstrate the latest technology
and ideas for the broadcast community.
<P>
For some the bright lights and the lure of big winnings from the
one armed bandits may have been the big attraction but for most
this event was serious big time business. This show was the opportunity
of the year for technology companies both large and small to elbow
their way into the fray to secure valuable market share. In addition
to over 1,000 exhibits with their miles of aisles, and the usual
seminars, speeches and demonstrations NAB featured it's own daily
newspaper delivered to the hotel room door of all registered conference
guests and it's own dedicated TV news channel.
<P>
For Ostafichuk though, the serious demeanor suits her well, which
explains why her company is leading the way in the growing captioning
industry. LOBCO Inc. established in 1989, has since it's inception
been single minded in it's efforts to push, prod or pull the broadcast
community into a 100% captioned programming day. Ostafichuk has
been working all ends of the captioning spectrum, working closely
with the end consumers, the government and regulaory bodies and
the broadcasters. From this unique position LOBCO Inc. was able
to develop a product that can address the needs of all parties.
<P>
While the response at NAB was substantial &quot;the largest task
still lies ahead&quot; claims Ostafichuk. The greatest need now
lies with the quality of real-time captioning for all news and
live programming. While the need is for the consumer it is the
broadcasters that echoed the need as virtually every broadcaster
at NAB was actively looking for the technology to satisfy that
demand.
<P>
If Ostafichuk has her way LOBCO Inc. will continue it's leading
ways and be the first company back at NAB with a real, real-time
captioning solution. 
<P>
Just getting to NAB with a new product line would be enough to
satisfy most people, but not Ostafichuk who views VoiceWriterTM
as just the first step as LOBCO Inc. is already well on its way
with the development of a new concept solution for real-time captioning.
<P>
Not resting on her laurels in Oakville after a grueling week in
Las Vegas, Ostafichuk is following up on international requests
and is already making arrangements to visit two other continents
to act as a consultant in establishing regulations and standards
for other countries. It would appear that LOBCO Inc. will be another
Canadian technology success story leading the way. Pursuing what
appears to be a lifelong ambition she seems destined to show the
world not only why, but more importantly how to improve communications
to a specialized audience. &quot;We just want everybody to sit
up and listen&quot;.

LOBCO Inc. was invited by Industry Canada to share their booth
and demonstrate the VoiceWriterTM Off-line Captioning System,
at this years CSUN convention which ran from March 20 to the 23.
The CSUN convention is a yearly event held in Los Angeles, where
new technology designed to improve access for the disabled is
showcased to a wide variety of end users and resellers.
<P>
This event was LOBCO Inc. first venture into the US market with
VoiceWriterTM. The VoiceWriterTM system quickly became the buzz
of the convention. The Industry Canada booth received many visitors

<P>
demanding demos of the captioning system that everyone was talking
about. The response was extremely positive and encouraging. VoiceWriterTM
will become the industry standard in off-line captioning.
<P>
Other highlights of the convention included a device that can
translate English into braille simultaneously. A satellite issuing
radio waves which aid the blind to locate where they are if they
become lost, and a TTY that enables the hard of hearing community
to use a pen instead of typing the message.

The Canadian Deaf Ice Hockey Federation (CDIHF) has been invited,
by the Russian Deaf Sports Union, to submit an entry to compete
in the European Invitational. The tournament will be hosted by
the city of Tiumen (not far from Moscow), from December 2 - 9,
1996. A total of fifteen players including two goalkeepers are
needed to make the Canadian Team.
<P>
The CDIHF began in the mid 1980's as a hockey school called Canadian
Hearing Impaired Hockey Association. After a few years of very
successful summer hockey camps, the graduates of the hockey school
needed a league of their own. On January 29th, 1987, the CDIHF
was formed as a non profit charitable organization to promote,
administer, and operate a hockey team comprized of Deaf players
to represent Canada at the World level. The CDIHF provided the
hockey camp players with two major goals to strive for: to make
the national team and to set an example for the younger generation
of deaf hockey players.
<P>
Unfortunately the CDIHF has the same problem as other amateur
national teams, FUNDING. As ice hockey continues to grow and governments
continues to cut back, other means of revenue must be explored.
The CDIHF has had success raising funds by organizing charity
games between NHL Old-timers and the Deaf National Team (or at
least a team that included some players with Deaf National talent).
But with the European Invitational this year, the fast approaching
World Winter Games for the Deaf in 1999, and other tournaments
and invitationals in between the CDIHF must have a steady stream
of revenue to scout, recruit and train more deaf hockey players
across Canada.
<P>
As more and more Canadians become aware of the high quality of
hockey played by the Deaf National Team the task of fundraising
will become less daunting. Until then, the CDIHF will continue
to depend on the generosity of others.

October 16, 1995 marked the official launch of The Caption Resource
Centre's new Oakville location.
<P>
Oakville Councillor Tedd Smith was on hand to officially cut the
ribbon and declare The Caption Resource Centre open.
<P>
Other notable attendees were Rogers Communication's Regulatory
Affairs Vice President, Michael Allen, Rogers Cablesystems, Ray
Skaff, National Manager of Captioning Services, as well as various
people representing broadcast related industries.
<P>
The Caption Resource Centre's primary function is to provide operating
space and office services to not-for-profit or not-yet-profitable
organizations whose missions are to improve the quality and increase
the quantity of closed captioning in Canada.
<P>
At the present time there are four organizations under The Caption
Resource Centre's umbrella. The Caption Clearinghouse, Canadian
Association of Captioning Consumers, LOBCO Inc. and Canada Caption
Inc.
<P>
The Caption Clearinghouse is a clearinghouse for captions and
video for new markets internationally. The Caption Clearinghouse
acts as a library, compiling captions and providing them to broadcasters,
making it much simpler and less expensive for them to acquire
the captions. The benefits will result in more programs being
closed captioned.
<P>
LOBCO Inc. was established in 1990. LOBCO Inc. works with television
broadcasters in implementing operations policy and procedures
related to social issues.
<P>
LOBCO's latest release is VoiceWriterTM. VoiceWriterTM is timeline
based editing that makes it easy to create, insert, edit or delete
captions. With VoiceWriterTM a one hour program can be captioned
in just three or four hours.
<P>
Canada Caption Inc. (CCI) is a three-and-a-half year old charitable
organization who's mandate is to increase and improve the quality
of closed captioning for the deaf and hard of hearing. &quot;Everyone
benefits&quot; is key to CCI's success...and everyone does benefit,
as CCI will underwrite over 6,698 hours of captioning in the 1995/96
season.
<P>
Canadian Association of Captioning Consumers (CACC) is a lobby
group that represents the deaf and hard of hearing at CRTC interventions
and also publishes the Captioning Today Magazine.

Once Again</A>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>By: John D. Rossi</B>
<P>
The question: &quot;How do we protect our children from the harmful
effects of unnecessary television violence?&quot; Thanks to the
closed captioning industry, this question may not be as difficult
as everyone may think.
<P>
The CRTC is entertaining the concept of V-CHIP technology. This
chip will allow parents to program their televisions to block
out the programs that contain excessive violence. At the CRTC's
Violence Hearings held in Toronto, October 10 and 11, Canada Caption
Inc. presented a proposal that would combine the V-CHIP technology
with the existing Closed Captioning chip (CC-CHIP) found in every
television manufactured in the United States over 13&quot; since
mid 1993.
<P>
The research and development cost of the V-CHIP could be greatly
reduced by adapting the existing CC-CHIP, which decodes Line 21
of the Vertical Blinking Interval (VBI), to decode violence ratings.
<P>
Also the distribution nightmare will be solved. Since on average,
a household purchases a new television every seven years, it is
conceivable that every household would have both built-in features
decoding Line 21 by the end of the century.
<P>
Line 21 of the VBI has room in its data stream to code and carry
data on the violence classification of television programming.
By marrying the V-CHIP with the CC-CHIP there would be no change
in the manufacturing process or a massive retooling of the manufacturers
facilities. Closed captioning will not be affected, in fact, more
of the non-deaf community will become aware of the potential benefits
of closed captioning in their daily lives.
<P>
By utilizing Line 21 on the VBI for the V-CHIP a parent can ensure
that their child is denied all access to violence. If the V-CHIP
is separate from the CC-CHIP then the child will still have access
to the text
<P>
of the undesired program. CCI&quot;s proposal does not put the
means of administration and distribution in the hands of cable
companies and broadcasters. All the control will be placed in
the hands of those who should have control, the parents.
<P>
The issue of violence on television is very sensitive and is an
issue that will never disappear. The public is looking for a quick
and practical solution without any additional cost. By using the
advancements that closed captioning technology has made, and incorporating
the V-CHIP concept with the existing CC-CHIP this transition could
prove to be less costly and more efficient for everyone involved.

Perhaps this is good news, perhaps not. I guess that depends largely
on just how keen or edgy the caption consumers are for ones constantly
seeking full access to TV programmes. News in the launching of
&quot;Cable in the Classroom&quot; has just been out that may
enthrall thousands of educators in the publicly-funded schools,
universities, colleges and programs across Canada. Starting September
1995, Cable in the Classroom is a national education initiative
by a majority of Canadian cable operators and television program
providers, - YTV, Discovery, Newsworld, CNN, RDI, etc. This 22-channelled
Canadian Cable is committed to the distributing and airing of
educationally relevant, copyright-cleared, commercial-free, French
and English language cable television programmings. For enriched
instruction to the classroom viewing of these programmes, curriculum
support materials are also being developed. As far as I can discern,
no mention of an assurance of captions as a service provided was
made that would be promised to caption user-students who are deaf
and hard of hearing, ESL and learners of a language in printed
form. How will we caption consumers know that programmes will
be aired to the educational institutions in captioned version?
Unless we make the move to remind them of the significance of
closed captioning or the goal to obtain 100% captioning by the
year 2000, we may succumb to something fallen short of the mark.
In other words, we might as well see TV programming revert to
the days when TV was nothing more than radio with pictures.
<P>
As a concerned educator and caption user, I would appreciate in
hearing your views on this. Should we join forces in speaking
up and send letters to the Canadian cable television industry.
<P>
This is another topic of concern which I feel may also affect
us caption consumers in Canada, however, indirectly. Of course,
as Canadians, we do not succumb to watching every show that is
American-produced, particularly as it comes closed captioned.
However, news of the potential federal funding cutbacks in the
U.S. Congress have caused me to feel goosebumps. Should the U.S.
Government decide to snip back as much as a half of the I.D.E.A.
(Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) grant which enables
the growth of captioned media in the U.S.A., then many of our
favourite American programmes will lose the captioning segment
of the show. My worry also extends to that of another cut in funding
allotment. As the second largest grant to fund captions (for PBS
shows only) in the States - it is also under careful scrutiny
by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPS) at the WGBH station
of Boston, Mass. Funding cuts from both sources to captioning
media will have seriously and disastrously affected millions of
Americans who rely on their constitutional rights to media information
and will have a huge impact on the Canadian viewers of American
entertainment as well. Certainly, we have had the fortune of having
the best of both worlds as we also enjoy Canadian-produced captioned
programmes. What I wonder is - should the American shows be viewed
up north albeit the captioning access - would Canadian broadcasters
be willing to pool extra money to caption them before airing time?
I'll be interested in following this up really closely but I suspect
we'll know for sure what happens with the funding cuts over the
border before the year is over.

Re: CACC Lobbies Government to close caption all Video Material
<P>
<I>Sent to CACC offices August 8, 1995</I>
<P>
&quot;..... Two years ago Ian Fraser and I, (then President of
CHHA) met with Treasury Board representatives to give them our
thoughts on this subject; in fact we went a little farther to
say that all government Films and Video material (both for public
consumption and for interal use) should carry open captions. Our
rationale for this was that in all circumstances, the user may
not have a decoder.&quot; &quot;..... Good luck, and keep up the
good work!&quot;

In 'CAD Chat August 1995' we came across this bit of information
- &quot;The CAD made a motion that the WFD withdraw its support
of the &quot;slashed-ear&quot; universal access symbol. The motion
passed by a large majority. The WFD will continue to use the symbol
until a replacement is found. The replacement must convey a positive
image of deafness.

<A NAME="gopen">Gopen Family Dedicated to Helping the Deaf</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
<B>By: Jackie Walsh</B>
<P>
Touched by the deafness of a young family member, four generations
of the Gopen family have dedicated themselves to helping those
who cannot hear. Their story centres around Justin Gopen, whose
deafness from unknown causes was diagnosed approximately 15 years
ago.
<P>
According to Stuart Gopen, Justin's father, the Gopen family took
on an important cause on the day they learned of Justin's deafness
at the age of 8 months. Stuart has become active in improving
services for the deaf. One accomplishment of which he is particularly
proud is his recent publication of &quot;Gopen's Guide to Closed-Captioned
Video&quot; a directory which lists video from the late 1930s
through June 1993. A former video store owner, Stuart's impetus
for the guide came from his own experience. While bringing home
movies for his family to enjoy, Stuart noticed how limited video
choices were for people with hearing impairments.
<P>
&quot;After two years I realized that most videos weren't closed-captioned.
I had many deaf customers, and there was very little for them
to choose from. Much of the labeling on the boxes was seriously
incorrect. I felt it was important to have accurate information
available to the deaf.&quot; Stuart says.
<P>
Although federal law requires that virtually all televisions sold
in the United States manufactured after July 1, 1993 have built-in
decoders, the vast majority of videos are still uncaptioned. Stuart
has also taken the issue to its source: major film studios and
video distributors. Working with a group called Caption Action,
Stuart has helped to activate public support for more widespread
closed-captioning, which, according to its advocates is an effective
tool for teaching reading to children and illiterate adults, as
well as teaching English as a second language.
<P>
Justin feels that he has directly benefited from closed-captioning.
&quot;Watching videos with closed-captioning has helped me a lot
because it is like reading a book,&quot; he says, using his mother
as an interpreter. &quot;I've gained better English skills and
a better vocabulary.&quot; Justin has a reading comprehension
level of 95 percent, which is excellent for a deaf person his
age.

As part of the grand opening of the Caption Resource Centre in
Oakville, October 16, 1995, Ontario, Rogers Cablesystems Limited,
presented a cheque to Canada Caption Inc. for research and development
of voice recognition as it applies to captioning. Michael Allen,
V.P. Regulatory Affairs for Rogers Communications Inc. was on
hand to present the cheque to Beverley Ostafichuk, Executive Director
of Canada Caption Inc.
<P>
This initiative represents a small portion of the national commitment
to promote and develop the resources for the deaf, deafened and
hard of hearing communities.
<P>
&quot;We are excited about this new technology and we look forward
to implementing the voice recognition captioning system into Rogers
regional captioning centres across Canada in early 1996,&quot;
says Ray Skaff, National Manager of Captioning Services for Cablesystems
&quot;These captioning centres will allow us to offer local community
programming to a whole new audience.&quot;

<A NAME="integration">Integration on the Information Highway</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
<B>By Deb Finn, Industry Canada</B>
<P>
Let's get one thing straight: the Information Highway is more
than just the Internet. It encompasses a whole range of methods
for creating, exchanging and sharing information in the course
of our daily lives. Everything from public transportation to computer
programs to electronic messaging and yes, captioning, has direct
links to the Information Highway.
<P>
As readers of Captioning Today, you are already aware that plenty
is happening in Canada to develop faster, more accurate and economical
captioning. But just as the issues of interest to people with
disabilities are not all health-related, not all of the technical
developments that will enable Canadians who are deaf or hard of
hearing are related to captioning.
<P>
Industry Canada, through its participation in the National Strategy
for the Integration of Person with Disabilities, has funded a
number of projects over the past four years that will help ensure
Canadians who are deaf or hard of hearing will have equal access
to the Information Highway. Here are some of the developments
that we've supported:
<P>
A company in Montreal called Telecite has developed a Visual Communication
Network (VCN) system that provides subway riders with real-time
transit information in audio and visual formats. This includes
in-car and platform announcements of concern to the riders: next
stop, next train, schedule changes or delays and emergency information.
Telecite has already sold its system in the US and has a pilot
system operating in Paris and the company is in the process of
adapting the technology for use in municipal and intercity buses
too, which will make it even easier for everyone to use public
and commercial transportation.
<P>
Voice mail has become an extremely common feature. The trouble
with voice mail is that it is an audio based technology. Those
people who use TTY's for their telephone communications can't
make use of voice mail. The good news is that Ottawa's IDON Corporation
has been working closely with the Canadian Association of the
Deaf to develop a computer-based video store-and-forward system,
called Telesign, that allows you to sign your message and send
it to another computer user. This is the first step towards real-time
videoconferencing that is affordable for the average person. At
present, the low-cost videoconferencing systems that are available
for home computers aren't good enough to enable live conferencing:
the picture is too jerky for smooth signing. As video compression
techniques improve and system costs come down, it will be possible
to use real-time conferencing to sign your conversations.
<P>
In Sherbrooke, Quebec, a company called D&eacute;cade has developed
a sound system that eliminates background noise in public halls,
lecture theatres and other such places, so that people using hearing
aids can hear what they're supposed to instead of the roar of
the crowd. Using low-powered FM transmitters, users can easily
pick up clear signals, even using a Walkman or similar receiver.
<P>
Last year, the Minister of Industry set up the Information Highway
Advisory Council (IHAC) to advise him on how to implement the
new information infrastructure. This September, IHAC published
its Final Report, &quot;Connection Community Content: The Challenge
of the Information Highway&quot;, which made a number of specific
recommendations that are aimed at making sure all Canadians can
get on the Information Highway.
<P>
The IHAC recommendations indicate that there is a real commitment
growing in Canadian society to build in accessibility from the
design stage onwards, instead of following the traditional course
of introducing a technology and adapting it for users with special
needs, after the fact. By acting on the recommendations, the government
can help ensure that Canadians who have disabilities will not
have to waste time playing technological &quot;catch-up&quot;
on the Information Highway.

<A NAME="speech">Non-Speech Information in Captioned Video</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
<B>By: Jackie Walsh</B>
<P>
I recently came across &quot;A Report to the Captioning Industry&quot;
based on a study of consumer preferences by the Technology Assessment
Program, Gallaudet University in Washington, DC that took place
between December 1992 and May 1994.
<P>
The purpose of this study was to improve captioning of &quot;non-speech
information&quot; (NSI). NSI describes aspects of the sound track,
other than spoken words, which may convey information about the
plot, humour, mood or meaning of a spoken passage.
<P>
Some examples of NSI are identification of off-screen speaker(s)
and multiple on-screen speakers, sound effects, music such as
singing or background music (mood enhancement) manner of speaking
as in whispering, emotion or word emphasis, audience reaction,
booing, laughter, applause, indication of title such as a book,
film, play or newspaper and explanation of puns.
<P>
Many in the captioning industry are aware of NSI and caption them.
The problem arises when there are no specific guidelines in place
and everyone uses varied methods to show the same information.
<P>
An Advisory Committee consisting of consumers and caption industry
representatives advised the research staff on all aspects of the
study and reviewed the findings and draft recommendations before
they were circulated to the industry for comment.
<P>
Thirty-eight hours of video were analyzed in detail for current
NSI practices, nineteen video clips from television provided nineteen
different examples of NSI and two or three different ways of captioning
to indicate NSI were selected.
<P>
Deaf and hard of hearing consumers from community groups, schools
and agencies viewed the videotape and indicated their preference
from the choices.
<P>
The Advisory Committee recommended as a result, that speaker identification
be the highest priority of non-speech information studied.
<P>
Other NSI guidelines were to include a descriptive caption in
order to enhance the viewer's awareness of the audio; that background
music be indicated especially if it contributes to the understanding
of the plot or mood; that where feasible using onomatopoeia and
description be used to indicate sound effects (onomatopoeia should
never be used alone); that the musical-note icon be used around
the caption to indicate singing; that when multiple speakers appear
on the screen placement should be used to distinguish among them;
that off-screen narrators be explicitly identified rather than
using italics or colour; that whispered speech be identified as
such; that italics be used to show emphasis of word(s) in a caption;
that quotation marks are used when indicating titles of books
or movies; that audience reaction be captioned; that strong emotions
be conveyed; that foreign accents be indicated at least once and
that puns be briefly explained when feasible.
<P>
These &quot;Draft Guidelines on Indicating Non-Speech Information
in Captioned Video&quot; have been sent out to the captioning
industry for their comments. It should be interesting to see if
everyone can agree on a specific set of guidelines.
<P>
I've been in touch with Gallaudet University and the final report
entitled, &quot;Non-Speech Information in Captioned Video: A Consumer
Opinion Study with Guidelines for the Captioning Industry&quot;
by Judith E. Harkins, Ellie Korres, Beth Singer and Barbara M.
Virvan has been finalized.

Canada Caption Inc. and LOBCO Inc., the developer of VoiceWriterTM,
a non-linear voice recognition captioning system, were in attendance
at the Canadian Association of Broadcasters (CAB) convention.
The annual convention was held in the nations capital on October
28 and 29. It was a definite success with the Hon. John Manley,
Minister of Industry, attending the VoiceWriterTM booth. Minister
Manley was enthusiastic and fully endorses the product.
<P>
VoiceWriterTM is the solution for captioning. It increases productivity
by 50% with a significant reduction in cost. Beta tested by the
closed captioning professionals it meets all of the industry's
requirements.
<P>
VoiceWriterTM is the only voice recognition captioning system
available today. This disk-based captioning system gives the captioner
the ability to quickly access the location of the text that is
required. It is speaker dependent and allows endusers to fine-tune
or create voice driven commands or text.
<P>
LOBCO Inc. is continuing with research and development until the
system supports a 100% captioned broadcast day in real-time. With
this technology 100% captioning can be met by 1996.

Programs such as the National Strategy of Integration of Persons

enable people with disabilities to be independent within their

that. Unfortunately, the National Strategy comes to an end on
March 31, 1996 and no follow-on program has yet been mandated.
<P>
In order to see the development of more great products like the
VCN the onus is put on individuals to voice what they believe
is right. It would be a shame if the VCN was to be one of the
last great success stories.

<H1><A NAME="Canada">Canada </A>and the CRTC Set the Precedent
for Other Countries to Follow</H1>

<H4>By John D. Rossi</H4>

<P>
CRTC's Commissioner Gail Scott reinforced the CRTC's position
on the future of captioning in Canada to a group of Canadian broadcasters
and closed captioners during the Captioning Awareness Week Information
Highway and Technological Liberation Seminar held at the Sutton
Place Hotel on May 31, 1995.
<P>
As outlined in the CRTC's Public Notice 1995-48, the cost of captioning
has decreased significantly over the past seven years and most
broadcasters now have sufficient resources to provide full programming
services to the deaf and hard of hearing.
<P>
&quot;I strongly believe&quot;, stated Commissioner Scott, &quot;that
the CRTC's recent policy on captioning is part of what the <I>Telecommunications
Act</I> means by 'enrich(ing) and strengthen(ing) the social and
economic fabric of Canada'. Canadians should have access to our
broadcasting system in a comprehensible way, taking advantage
of innovative technologies&quot;.
<P>
Commissioner Scott went on to say, &quot;Our recent policy...is
really divided into three categories, those whose revenues are
over 10 million dollars, those who are 10 million and those who
are less than 10 million dollars with a requirement, an expectation
or encouragement that and with the target date of 90% captioning
by 1998. They've (broadcasters) got to do it, and I'm sure they
are devoting the proper resources to that&quot;.
<P>
She further stated, &quot;We (CRTC) didn't say 100%, we said 90%,
to leave a little bit of flexibility for when the system breaks
down for what ever reason,... because frankly if you are 90%,
you are doing 100%&quot;.
<P>
Public Notice 1995-48 leaves little doubt on the future of captioning
in Canada and it's up to the individual broadcasters to allocate
the appropriate funds to make this policy a reality.
<P>
CACC and other deaf or hard of hearing organizations in Canada,
congratulate the CRTC for its forward thinking and complete understanding
of the whole picture surrounding captioning in Canada and tremendous
sensitivity to the needs of the deaf and hard of hearing community,
children and new Canadians.<HR>

<H1><A NAME="Business">Business</A>, Not Charity: Industry Canada's
Participation in the National Strategy</H1>

<H4>By Deb Finn</H4>

<P>
Easier access to electronic bulletin boards by people with disabilities,
transmitters that help people with hearing impairments to hear
what's going on at public events, elevators you can control with
your voice...sounds like somebody's wish list, doesn't it?
<P>
Maybe, but these are examples of some of the development projects
that are being funded by Industry Canada. Since 1991, the department
has been working with public and private sector organizations
to develop communications devices, products or services to assist
people with a variety of disabilities. The department brings its
clients the technical expertise that helps develop actual products
you can really hold in your hands, see, hear or control with your
voice.
<P>
Industry Canada is one of eight federal partners in the <B>National
Strategy</B> for the Integration of Persons with Disabilities.
To find out what Canadians with disabilities wanted, the department
(then - Communication Canada) commissioned a Needs Study that
was released in 1993 and it showed that many of the items consumers
with disabilities wanted could actually be developed or adapted
at low cost.
<P>
The <B>National Strategy</B> has had a strong and positive impact
on the lives of Canadians with and without disabilities. The projects
funded are far from being just another round of government handouts.
They must all have end-user sponsorship or endorsement, to ensure
that the project will result in something the intended users really
want. Partners must also be willing to contribute their own time
and money to the project.
<P>
Over the past four years, the <B>National Strategy Office</B>
in <B>Industry Canada</B> has developed a worldwide reputation
for its knowledge of the assistive devices industry in Canada.
Virtually all of the activities supported by the programme either
would not have occurred without funding, or they had their timing
advanced as a result of <B>Industry Canada's</B> support. Both
the export potential for the products developed and the return
on investment for Canadian companies is high. As one Vancouver
company noted recently, thanks to the support of the department,
Canada is moving into the manufacture of its own communications
products for people with disabilities and away from being purely
on import market.
<P>
Participation in the <B>National Strategy</B> has also been highly
instrumental in meeting the Industry Minister's widely publicized
goal of increasing support for small business. Most of the companies
supported by Industry Canada under the <B>National Strategy</B>
have been small and medium-sized enterprises, working in a sector
of the economy that would otherwise have been ignored. It's also
provided new business opportunities for companies that have entered
the assistive communication device field for the first time.
<P>
Unfortunately, all this could come to an end in March 1996. That's
when the National Strategy's mandate runs out. The <B>Strategy
Office</B> hopes that there will continue to be opportunities
to build upon the solid foundations that were put in place by
this extraordinary partnership of governments, organizations,
businesses and the end-users March 31, but in a climate of government
cutbacks and restraint, nothing is certain.

<H1><A NAME="Captioning">Captioning</A> On The Information Highway
</H1>

<H2>Look for On-line access of news and current affairs </H2>

<H4>By Ellen Rusi</H4>

<P>
Those of you who have cruised the information highway, surfed
the 'net, and not gotten stuck in the World Wide Web know that
venturing out into cyberspace offers access to more information
than most of us could possibly read or need in a lifetime!
<P>
This network of networks referred to as the Information Superhighway
offers Canadians access to a glut of data, and provides links
between people around the globe.
<P>
Captioning databases consisting of the transcripts of television
programs, such as, dramatic series, news and information, and
current affairs are coming increasingly available on the Highway
via the Internet and the World Wide Web. For example, the CBC,
at http://www.cbc.ca, offers the transcript of the previous evening's
episode of Prime Time News. Or, at The Discovery Channel's Website,
at http://www.discovery.ca, you can access the transcripts of
back episodes of their programs - instantly and for free. Cropping
up, as well, are on-line news clipping services who charge subscribers
a small fee for the privilege of accessing news and current information
from many sources including television transcripts and newspaper
articles, all at one site.
<P>
This trend bodes well for the industry of captioning - as it creates
yet another market for captioning data - and one more reason for
broadcasters to caption 100% of their broadcast day.<HR>

<H1><A NAME="ABC">Does ABC know what NCI is doing?</A></CENTER><EM>
</EM></H1>

<H4>By Ellen Rusi</H4>

<P>
This summer issue marks one year since Captioning Today first
broke the story on the National Captioning Institutes' profiteering
from U.S. captions previously paid for by the U.S. Department
of Education, Corporations, producers etc.
<P>
The practice involves NCI seeking remuneration from Canadian broadcasters
for U.S. captions already paid for. These fees are not based on
what it costs to caption or what it costs to provide the captions,
but on the size of a broadcast market. Clearly <U><I>not</I></U>
a non-profit activity.
<P>
What this means for Canadian deaf and hard of hearing television
viewers is fewer Canadian programmes being captioned because Canadian
broadcasters must give their captioning dollars to NCI for U.S.
captions already paid for. CACC will now target the American Broadcasting
Corporation, ABC to stop giving NCI, exclusively, all their captioning
work. If NCI does not do the work, then they cannot continue this
practice.
<P>
As a result of our efforts in the last year, Peter O'Neil of the
Canadian Association of Broadcasters agreed to put the issue on
the agenda of the CAB 6 June 1995, Executive meeting. It is hoped
that all CAB members will rally together with the deaf and hard
of hearing community to stop this activity. We continue to wait
for the results of the 6 June meeting.<HR>

<P>
<I>According to CRTC Decision 95-417 July 7, 1995, <B>ASN</B>
gets approval for their license renewal on condition that they
must caption all of its self-produced news programming, including
live segments, by the end of its new licence term (August 31,
2000).</I> 
<P>
<I><B>ASN</B> is also expected to close caption 70% of its programming
by the end of its licence term.</I><HR>

<P>
The project to create<I> <B>VoiceWriterTM</B></I>, the only approach
to captioning a programme that will allow television broadcasters
to provide 100% access by the year 2000 may fall apart, as the
Canada Caption Inc. (CCI) Research and Development fund is dwindling
and sources for renewed partnerships in this activity need to
be identified.
<P>
<I><B>VoiceWriterTM</B></I>, a non linear, voice recognition based
captioning system was designed to decrease the time in which it
takes to caption a one hour programme from ten hours to four hours.
<P>
<I><B>VoiceWriterTM</B></I> is the brainchild of LOBCO Inc. a

The 1994-95 season was a frustrating time for hockey fans and

&quot;I was pleased to learn from your Spring '95 issue that Blockbuster
Video now have facilities to test a video for closed captioning.
This will certainly alleviate some of the frustration of arrving
home with a tape marked with the captioned sign ....only to find
out it's not! But why does it <U>say</U> the film is captioned
if it's not and more importantly why <U>isn't</U> it captioned?

my experience at this year's Fifth Anuual Mayfest 1995 in Ottawa
held at the Jim Durrell Recreation Centre on May 27th.
<P>
Mayfest is a cultural showcase for the deaf, deafened and hard
of hearing communities. There were over 35 display/presentations...along
with a social that over 300 people attended.
<P>
Copies of Captioning Today were distributed from the Ontario Caption
Consumers' table and questions regarding both organizations and
captioning in general were answered.

From the feedback we have heard from this years Mayfest, it will
be bigger and better next year.&quot;

Here's a couple more letters from government bodies responding

agencies to close caption any video material that they produce.
<P>
From the <B>Office of the Minister of National Defence</B> - <I>&quot;The
Minister of National Defence is aware of the needs of Canadians
with sensory disabilities. Last year, the Director of General
Public Affairs initiated an alternative formats program to provide
people with hearing .... disabilities access to public information.</I>

<P>
<I>Closed captioning is one of the formats that we will certainly
use whenever audio material is produced ....&quot;</I> 
<P>
And from the <B>Minister of Finance's office</B> - &quot;...<I>All

decide to use some of the electronic mediums, I can assure you
that your concerns will be taken into consideration....&quot;</I>

<P>
When a noted filmmaker learns that her closest childhood friend
has been convicted of murder, she goes to extraordinary lengths
to have the decision reversed in the television movie <I><B>In</B></I>
<I><B>The Blink Of An Eye</B></I>, airing <U>Monday, January 15,
1996, (8:00 - 10:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
<B>Veronica Hamel </B>and <B>Mimi Rogers </B>star in the two-hour
production.
<P>
Based on a true story, <I><B>In The Blink Of An Eye </B></I>is
about a remarkable friendship between two women, who made a pact
during their youth to be &quot;blood sisters&quot; forever.  Three
decades later, the one, Micki Dickoff (Hamel), a distinguished
documentary filmmaker, learns that the other, Sunny Jacobs (Rogers),
has been imprisoned for the last 15 years.  Sunny, along with
her companion Jesse, had been convicted of killing two policemen
and now Sunny is about to be executed for the crime.
<P>
Micki visits her childhood friend in prison who professes she
is innocent, claiming that the shots must have come from an ex-con,
Walter Rhodes, who was riding in the car with Sunny and Jesse
and their children.  When they were arrested, the District Attorney
was determined to obtain a speedy conviction.  To that end, he
cut a deal that would see Rhodes testifying that Sunny and Jesse
killed the officers.  As well, the D.A. persuaded an inmate to
falsely testify that Sunny had told her that Sunny and Jesse had,
indeed, killed the cops.
<P>
Believing in Sunny's innocence, Micki puts her career on hold
to solve her friend's case and reaches a startling  conclusion.
  <I><B>In The Blink Of An Eye</B></I>, directed by Micki Dickoff,
 airs <U>Monday, January 15, 1996, at 8:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>

CHCH Has The Movie Special
<H1>WHERE ARE MY CHILDREN?</H1>

<HR>

<P>
A single mother of three, jailed on a dubious charge, returns
home to discover that her children have disappeared from the baby-sitter's
home. Determined to find her children, she embarks on a long journey
that takes her across the country in <I><B>Where Are My Children?</B></I>
airing <U>Tuesday, October 3, 1995, (9:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U> on
<B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
<B>Marg Helgenberger</B> (<I>China Beach</I>) and <B>Corbin Bernsen</B>
(<I>L.A. Law</I>) star in the two-hour movie.
<P>
<B>Where Are My Children?</B>, set in a Georgia Navy town in 1962,
is about Vanessa Myer (Helgenberger), a young, divorced mother
of three who holds down two jobs to support her family. She is
arrested by federal agents for a minor transgression -- hitching
a ride on a government airplane. The small infraction results
in a three-month jail term. When she is released, she is faced
with the shocking news that her three children (Kathy, 6, Dean,
5, and her baby, Isobel) have vanished.
<P>
A private detective is the only person able to provide a clue
as to why her children were abducted. His theory: a judge, operating
outside the boundaries of the law, is illegally taking children
from poor homes and putting them up for adoption by wealthy, childless
couples. 
<P>
Steadfast in her commitment to recover her family, Vanessa sets
out on a cross-country search to find the answer to the question:

(one hour drama, simulcast/CBS)
<P>
Based on John Grisham's best-selling novel and movie of the same
name, this riveting drama is about an exacting attorney who risks
her career and, sometimes her life, to champion the cause of children
-- pawns in the social system. Presiding over her courtroom is
the compassionate and wise Judge Harry Roosevelt; her most fervent
opponent in that arena is District Attorney Roy Foltrigg. John
Grisham's: &quot;The Client&quot; stars JoBeth Williams (Wyatt
Earp), John Heard (The Pelican Brief), Ossie Davis (The Client),
Polly Holliday (Gremlins), and Raphael Sbarge (Risky Business).

caseload while raising his 12- year-old daughter. Help comes from
a hard-edged lawyer (a former lover) and an ex-cop whose sleazy
nature proves invaluable. Charlie Grace stars Mark Harmon (Reasonable
Doubts, Wyatt Earp), Cindy Katz (The Age of Innocence), Robert
Costanzo (City Slickers) and LeeLee Sobieski (A Horse for Danny).

<B>&quot;Almost Perfect&quot;</B>
<P>
(half-hour comedy, pre-release/CBS)
<P>
A fast talking, fast thinking, Hollywood writer/producer has it
all, except a long-term relationship. When she suddenly meets
an overachieving District Attorney, sparks fly. A good place to
start for two workaholic control freaks in the '90s who want a
meaningful relationship. Nancy Travis (Fluke) and Kevin Kilner
star in Almost Perfect. Executive producers and writers: David
Isaacs, Ken Levine (Cheers, Wings, Frasier), and Robin Schiff
(Delta, Princesses).<HR>

The courage, ingenuity, and heart- stopping dogfighting skills
of a brave band of neophyte fighter pilots are all that stand
between Earth's freedom and alien domination. Members of the squadron
are led by Sgt. Major Bougus, a man whose tough exterior masks
his genuine caring for his charges. <B>Space</B> stars R. Lee
Ermey, Morgan Weisser, Kristen Cloke, Rodney Rowland, Lanei Chapman,
Joel De La Fuente, and James Morrison. Executive producers/writers:
Glen Morgan and James Wong (The X-Files).<HR>

<B>&quot;Strange Luck&quot;</B>

A one-year-old baby is the sole survivor of a catastrophic plane
crash. The incident, not an isolated event, is the beginning of
a pattern for Chance Harper, who grows up with the uncanny ability
to divert disaster. Deciding to capitalize on his strange luck,
and magnetism for trouble, Chance freelances as a photo journalist
-- acquiring a collection of extraordinary photography and saving
a lot of lives in the process. D. B. Sweeney (Roommates, Cutting
Edge), Pam Gidley (Tour of Duty, Angel Street), and Frances Fisher
(Unforgiven, Pink Cadillac, L.A. Story) star. Executive producer:
Karl Schaefer (Eerie Indiana, TV 101).<HR>

<P>
<B>&quot;Dweebs&quot;</B> 
<P>
(half-hour comedy, pre-release/CBS)
<P>
For the geniuses at Cyberbite Software, connecting complex computer
systems is easier than connecting with people. But, when a computer
illiterate office manager is hired, she proves to be invaluable
to an amusing mix of cyber-nerds. <B>Dweebs</B> stars Farrah Forke
(Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman), Peter Scolari

'Tis the season for giving and <B>CHCH-TV, Hamilton-Wentworth

<P>
Since 1988, <B>CHCH-TV</B>, <B>Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police

Share</B> facing one of its toughest challenges to date, the five
organizations have united their food drive efforts in strong support
of <I><B>The Christmas Community Food Drive</B></I>, the new name
for the <I>Greater Hamilton Food Share Christmas Food Drive</I>

<B>CHCH-TV, Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police, Y95, The Spectator

him to be a top surgeon at one of Toronto's major hospitals. 
Instead, he becomes a GP in a small Canadian city.  While preparing
a lecture on the pancreas for a local medical school, inspiration
strikes and Banting is convinced he knows how to stop the killing
power of diabetes.
<P>
    
<P>
Meanwhile, Elizabeth Hughes (Hess), the daughter of one of the
most powerful men in the United States -- the U.S. Secretary of
State -- daily loses ground to the destructive forces of diabetes.
 As the child nears the end of her valiant battle, Mrs. Hughes
(Henry) makes an impassioned plea to Banting to test the extract
on her dying daughter.
<P>
Banting's research, which ultimately provides hope for thousands
of diabetics worldwide, does not come without a high price.  
The great doctor loses the woman he loves; his relationships with
other scientists is tension-filled; and there is the persistent
fear that the solution he seeks will remain a distant dream.
<P>
<I><B>Glory Enough For All</B></I>, a two-part series, airs <U>Sunday,
January 21, 1996, and Monday, January 22, 1996, at 9:00 p.m.</U>,
both nights, on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.

In <I><B>Her Hidden Truth</B></I>, Billie (Martin) was 10 years

innocence, Father Paul (Clapp), attends a parole hearing with
her.   When her parole is denied, Billie breaks out of the facility
to find the real killer.

After making plans to meet with Father Paul, Billie arrives to
discover his dead body.  To further complicate matters, her fingerprints
are found on the murder weapon.  Fortunately for Billie, Matt
Samanie (Sabato), the detective working on the case, liked and
respected the priest, and for those reasons agrees to give Billie
one last chance to prove her innocence.

The mysterious puzzle leads them to the estate of wealthy Jack
Devereaux (Howard) and Devereaux's son, Clay (Diamond), who has
a sinister interest in Billie.  <I><B>Her Hidden Truth</B></I>

<H1><CENTER>JANE HAWTIN LIVE!</CENTER> <CENTER>Tackles The Issues
On Westcom TV Group Ltd.</CENTER></H1>

<P>
One of the most beloved and respected radio personalities in Canada
is moving to television! Jane Hawtin is joining the Westcom TV
Group Ltd. with a brand new interactive television talk show called
<I>Jane Hawtin Live!</I> Jane Hawtin Live! will be launched nationally
on the WIC television stations in late August 1995.
<P>
&quot;This is an exciting and timely venture for CHCH-TV and the
entire Westcom TV Group,&quot; expresses Jim Macdonald, president
and chief executive officer of CHCH-TV. &quot;We are living in
an age where interaction and information are essential, and one
of the great aspects of this show is that viewers will be able
to share their ideas and convictions with other Canadians. We
hope to have a full national network in place prior to launch.&quot;
<P>
Jim Macdonald's thoughts are echoed by the show's executive producer
Paul Osborn, &quot;Jane Hawtin Live! is long overdue. It's overdue
for the audience, for Jane, and for television. Jane has credentials,
confidence, and leadership; and I am thrilled to be bringing to
television, a host, who, I believe, is absolutely perfect for
the needs of the audience.&quot;
<P>
The timing is also important for the host and producer of the
show, Jane Hawtin. &quot;This move to television is happening
at exactly the right time in my life,&quot; she explains. &quot;I
have spent many years developing my skills in news and public
affairs. I've had some wild times doing talk radio and now it's
time to put it all together. I can finally allow our audience
to share all these great emotional moments by seeing them for
themselves.&quot;
<P>
For one hour each weekday, Jane Hawtin will act as the &quot;traffic
cop&quot; for the most engaging issues of the day, exposing every
possible side of a story through the insights of her studio guests
and call-in viewers. As audience participation will be by phone,
a 1-800 number will be provided.
<P>
It's going to be very exciting! Jane Hawtin has never been known
to shy away from any subject matter or issue. She consistently
pulls in top ratings and has gained a reputation for hard hitting
journalism with an accessible style. Osborn says with a laugh,
&quot;Jane can be a marshmallow or a shark depending on what's
needed to get to the heart of an issue.&quot; Jane adds, &quot;And
I love interacting with the callers. I am continually impressed
by the thoughtfulness of people, and I am constantly amazed by
what they are willing to share. It's going to be great to have
these thought- provoking exchanges happening nationwide.&quot;
<P>
<I>Jane Hawtin Live!</I>, premiering late August, 1995, will air
in the Toronto market on CHCH-TV (1:00 p.m.), on Vancouver's BCTV
(10:00 a.m.), in Calgary on CICT (11:00 a.m.), and in Edmonton
on ITV (11:00 a.m.). <HR>

<H2><CENTER><I><B>JANE HAWTIN LIVE!</CENTER></B></I></H2>

<P>
<I><B>Jane Hawtin Live!</B></I>, the new interactive television
talk show, premiered today by posing a question that has ignited
much anger among Canadians: &quot;Should Karla Homolka's plea
bargain deal be reviewed?&quot;  The result was a major phone
melt-down created by jammed phone lines across the country.
<P>
Viewers eager to communicate their opinions to Jane and her in-studio
guests -- Ontario MPP Chris Stockwell and criminal lawyer Marie
Henein -- crowded the phone system, with calls coming from such
diverse places as Yellowknife, Vancouver, Victoria, Toronto, Burlington,
Hamilton, Stoney Creek, Huntsville, Calgary, Edmonton, and Barrhead,
Alberta.  
<P>
Although concerned with the inability to take many viewer calls
on her inaugural show, the phone difficulties caused by an over-loading
of the system (a situation currently being resolved) boded well
with Jane Hawtin.   At the conclusion of her show she expressed
with a smile, &quot;I guess that means you're going to be willing
to talk with us.&quot;
<P>
Later this week on <I><B>Jane Hawtin Live!</B></I>, Jane will
match up the Mayor of Richmond, B.C. with the Mayor of Markham,
Ontario to field calls on racism in &quot;Chinese only malls&quot;
in affluent areas.  Tomorrow, Jane will ask the question: &quot;How
much responsibility do employers bear in protecting workers from
harassment and stalking?&quot; as she welcomes two very different
victims of stalking to her program -- one who is living in fear
of a former colleague, the other who is safe from her ex-husband
now in jail.
<P>
<I><B>Jane Hawtin Live!</B></I> airs weekdays in the Toronto market
on <B>CHCH-TV</B> (1:00 - 2:00 p.m.) simulcast with <B>AM 640,

<H1>&quot;KANSAS&quot;</H1>

<H3>A TOUCHING DRAMA ON CHCH-TV</H3>

</CENTER>

<P>
After a 20 year absence, a divorced mother of two returns to her
hometown to make peace with her family and ailing father.  In
the process, she rediscovers the value of family, roots and community.
 <I><B>Kansas</B></I> airs <U>Sunday, October 29, 1995, (7:00
- 8:30 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV.</B>
<P>
The cast includes <B>Patricia Wettig</B> (<I>thirtysomething,</I>
<I>Courthouse</I>)<B>, Jenny Robertson</B> and <B>Matt Craven</B>.

<P>
In <I><B>Kansas</B></I>, Virginia Mae Farley (Wettig), a successful
copywriter and single mother of two, rushes home to be with her
father when he suffers a heart attack.  The visit is all at once
significant and poignant.  
<P>
Although tension still exists between Virginia and her cantankerous
father (their fractious relationship was the cause of her leaving
to pursue a career in the city), Virginia feels the need to reconcile
their differences.  As well, she senses a strong obligation to
her grandmother and flighty sister, Betsy (Robertson), her father's
favourite.  In addition, with the reunion of old friends, her
hometown holds a strange allure for her.  The visit also brings
into focus how distant she and her own children have become. 
   
<P>
When her father suddenly dies, leaving her the farm, Virginia
is reluctant to leave.  Convincing her children to relocate, she
stays to carry on her father's legacy: the running of the farm
and his long-standing newspaper column.
<P>
<I><B>Kansas</B></I>, a touching drama of triumph and tragedy,
airs <U>Sunday, October 29, 1995, at 7:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.

</CENTER>

<P>
Jack Benny, a master of comedic timing, was a fixture on radio
and television for decades.  Through timeless, classic clips and
personal moments with famous Benny fans, Emmy winner <B>Kelsey
Grammer</B> (<I>Frasier</I>) pays tribute to his inspiration and
a remarkable legend. <I><B> Kelsey Grammer Salutes Jack Benny</B></I>,
airs <U>Thursday, November 30, 1995, (10:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U>
on <B>CHCH-TV</B>,
<P>
<I><B>Kelsey Grammer Salutes Jack Benny</B></I> opens with the
video illusion of <B>Grammer</B> performing in a typical Benny
sketch, and then follows Benny's distinguished career from vaudeville,
where his performance style evolved from a violinist with jocular
lines, to a witty emcee on Broadway and in films, into his comical,
miserly persona on radio and television. 
<P>
Showcased in performance with the perpetual 39-year-old who played
the violin poorly, kept his money in a basement vault protected
by his polar bear named Carmichael, and who refused to replace
his broken-down Maxwell car, are such show business giants as
<B>Milton Berle, Kirk Douglas, Nat King Cole, Jayne Mansfield,
Ann-Margret, Mike Wallace, Wayne Newton, </B>and <B>The Smothers
Brothers.</B>  Famous Benny admirers sharing personal thoughts
about their idol include <B>Jay Leno, Phil Hartman</B> (<I>NewsRadio</I>)
and <B>Dan Aykroyd</B> (<I>Ghostbusters, Driving Miss Daisy</I>).
<P>
One of the first performers to successfully employ self-deprecating
humour with the assistance of a repertory company of familiar
characters -- Mary Livingstone, his girlfriend (Mrs. Jack Benny
in real life); and valet/butler, Rochester -- is recognized for
his enduring talent when <I><B>Kelsey Grammer Salutes Jack Benny</B></I>,
<U>Thursday, November 30, 1995, at 10:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>
(simulcast/NBC).

A young ranger learns about life, love, honour, integrity and
the great forces of nature from the legendary veteran ranger Bill
Bell, a man who educates and guides the youth into manhood. <I><B>The

as the impressionable young rookie, Mac.
<P>
In <I><B>The Ranger, The Cook and a Hole in the Sky, </B></I>the
year is 1919, a time when rangers did more than just manage equipment.
There were no chemicals or airplanes to deal with forest fires,
instead, they were fought by the guts and courage of skilled rangers.

as a hero to most with a reputation to match. It was even rumoured
that he once killed a sheep farmer- a story that helped to magnify
his already large reputation.

<P>
A young family move into their dream home in the country, unaware
that hundreds of stray cats, possessing killer instincts, inhabit
the cellar and attic.  Desperately, they try to flee from their
home, and certain death by the sharp-teethed <I><B>Strays</B></I>,

<B>Timothy Busfield, Kathleen Quinlan, Claudia Christian </B>and
<B>Heather</B> and <B>Jessica Lilley </B>star in the two hour
teleplay, written by <B>Shaun Cassidy</B> of <I>American Gothic</I>
fame.
<P>
In <I><B>Strays</B></I>, Paul Jarrett (Busfield), his wife Lindsey
(Quinlan) and two-year-old daughter, Tessa (Lilley), move from
the city into a quaint country home.  However, their real estate
agent, Claire Lederer (Christian), neglects to inform the new
tenants that the previous owner was mauled to death by a gang
of extremely territorial, nomadic cats.
<P>
The first few days, the cats remain concealed in the cellar and
attic, but when an unsuspecting phone repairman arrives to fix
the shredded cables in the basement, he is swarmed by the felines.
  At that point, the strays start to infiltrate the house.   Their
next victim is Claire, who is pushed over the second story banister
during their attack.  Meanwhile, Lindsey manages to secure herself
and Tessa in the master bedroom until Paul returns from work.
 Then, it is Paul who is confronted by the assailing cats.  He
is successful in snaring the king cat, but becomes surrounded
by the entire cat family.
<P>
Who will rule the house in the end -- the Jarretts or the cats?

After a struggling art student agrees to become a surrogate mother

star in the two-hour TV movie.
<P>
<I><B>The Surrogate</B></I>:  Joan (Sellecca) and Stuart (Dukes)
Quinn, a couple running from a past that implicates them in the
death of their baby boy, want to have more children, but can't.
 As a result they begin a search to find the right woman to carry
their child.  Under the pretense of renting a cottage behind their
home, they interview potential candidates, obtaining from them
personal background information.  
<P>
Amy Winslow (Milano), a financially strapped art student answering
the Quinn's ad, is the perfect candidate.  She is a self-reliant
young woman, disinterested in relationships -- a result of being
raised in several foster homes.  Playing on her need for emotional
support, the Quinns make her feel part of the family, every kind
gesture a part of their unscrupulous plot.  Joan Quinn, an employee
at Amy's University, manages to manipulate the girl's financial
records, making her ineligible to receive her benefits.  Frantic
for funds to finish school, and wanting to please the Quinns,
Amy agrees to become their surrogate.
<P>
Pregnant, Amy spends more time with the Quinns, and slowly begins
to uncover their elaborate work of deception.  An old box of baby
clothes, visits from strangers, Joan's peculiar behaviour, and
old newspaper clippings lead Amy to conclusive evidence that Joan
and Stuart once had a baby, and that they were responsible for
the child's death.
<P>
Misunderstood by the police and friends for the reason why she
must keep her baby, Amy embarks on a desperate journey to expose
the Quinns and their treachery.  <I><B>The Surrogate</B></I> airs

<I>FOR IMMEDIATE  RELEASE: May 14, 1995</I>
<H1>THE MOTHER'S DAY TELETHON ON CHCH-TV  ACHIEVES GOAL FOR THIRD
CONSECUTIVE YEAR</H1> 
<HR>
<P>The Mother's Day Telethon, a partnership between CHCH-TV and
Chedoke-McMaster  Hospitals Foundation, kicked-off 24 hours of live
entertainment on Saturday, May 13, 1995, at  7:00 p.m., and concluded
tonight, Sunday, May 14, 1995, with another outstanding finale.  The 
ever-changing tote board proudly displayed the final tally of
$1,007,260.  
<P>
"We are continually overwhelmed by the generosity of the community,"
expresses Ursula Evans,  executive director of the Chedoke-McMaster
Hospitals Foundation, and co-executive  producer of the telethon. 
"Despite the instability of the current economy, people have unselfishly
 opened more than their hearts to help further the work of a facility
dedicated to serving acutely ill  children and children at risk, plus
their families."

<P>
Children's Hospital at Chedoke-McMaster serves a population base of
1.8 million people in  central west Ontario -- an area bounded by
Oakville, Niagara Falls, Kitchener-Waterloo, and  Tobermory.  Funds
raised from this year's telethon will be allocated to the following
areas: The  Emergency Department at the McMaster University Medical
Centre -- to assist in its  redevelopment; 3F Clinic -- an out-patient
area where children and their families come for day  treatments and
therapies; Child Maltreatment and Advocacy Program at the Chedoke site.

<P>
"In addition to the people who pledged during the telethon," says
Reg McGuire, executive vice  president and general manager of CHCH-TV,
and co-executive producer of the production, "a  heartfelt thank you is
also extended to the many celebrities who donated their time and talent;
to  the countless number of volunteers, community organizations,
businesses, and sponsors who  magnanimously supported the telethon; and
to the many CHCH-TV staff and crew who worked  tirelessly on the show. 
The efforts of all of these individuals directly contributed to the
success of  the telethon." 
<P>
The third annual Mother's Day Telethon on CHCH-TV succeeded once
again in bringing smiles  back by raising $1,007,260.

&quot;TERROR IN THE SHADOWS&quot;
<H3>A NEW MADE-FOR-TELEVISION MOVIE ON CHCH-TV</H3>

</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
A family is forced to live a life of fear and paranoia when a
woman, obsessed with revenge and misplaced affection, sets out
to destroy them in the unsettling drama, <I><B>Terror in the Shadows</B></I>,
airing <U>Sunday, October 15, 1995, (9:00 - 11:00 p.m.)</U> on
<B>CHCH-TV.</B>
<P>
<B>Genie Francis</B> (<I>General Hospital</I>), <B>Marcy Walker</B>
(<I>Santa Barbara, Guiding Light</I>) and <B>Leigh J. McCloskey</B>
(<I>General Hospital</I>) headline the cast.
<P>
In <I><B>Terror in the Shadows</B></I>, the Williams family --
Alex (McCloskey), Sarah (Francis) and their son Brian -- a picture
of domestic perfection, have just moved into a quaint, old Colorado
home.  When disturbing news regarding Alex's past reaches them,
their lives take a dramatic turn.  It seems that Alex's first
wife and adopted son were murdered by a woman named Christine
(Walker), the child's natural mother.  After the fatal attack,
she was hospitalized, but now she has escaped.  <B> </B>
<P>
Alex's concern that Christine will come after him in Colorado
becomes a horrifying reality. Cleverly, Christine weaves her way
into the very fabric of the Williams' life -- from working in
Sarah's coffeehouse to hiding in the family's basement and freely
roaming the house at night, all the while harbouring malevolent
thoughts towards Sarah and displaying displaced motherly affections
for Brian -- whom she believes is her son.
<P>
Sarah and Alex, overwhelmed by their fears and anxieties, are
understandably relieved when a police report states that Christine
has been found dead.  Not knowing the report to be false, they
drop their guard, placing themselves in a most vulnerable position
for a woman who has already destroyed one family and who is resolute
on destroying another.

<I><B>Terror in the Shadows</B></I> airs <U>Sunday, October 15,
1995, at 9:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV </B>(pre-release/NBC).

trembling.  Excuses are made to the children who know, only too
well, the truth of the situation.

In addition to his abusive nature, Paul is unfaithful to Judy.
 So, when an incident leaves his wife and daughter victims of
one of his rages, Paul runs to the home of his girlfriend, Beth

his inner demons compel him to assault even her.

<P>
In <I><B>White Dwarf</B></I>, young, self-assured Dr. Driscoll
Rampart (McDonough) is certain his assignment on a far-flung planet
is a mistake his well-connected father can correct.  One half
of the planet receives only daylight and is inhabited by the peaceful
&quot;Lightsiders&quot; who live like simple, old West frontiersmen.
 The other half, constantly hooded in darkness, is populated by
the violent &quot;Darksiders,&quot; who exist in a type of dismal
Gothic splendor.
<P>
Gradually, the enigmatic planet begins to influence Dr. Rampart,
as does his supervisor, Dr. Akada (Winfield).  He learns to temper
his egotism and develops a tenderness for even the poorest of
his patients, and on his travels to the Darkside, meets and falls
in love with Princess Ariel.  There is one problem, however, Princess
Ariel is promised in marriage to Strake, a Machiavellian advisor
to her father, the King, and a man who is secretly conspiring
to disrupt the peace proceedings with the Lightsiders.  In the
end, Strake's collusion leads to his downfall.
<P>
Finally, when Rampart is offered the chance to leave the planet,
he chooses to remain to explore its puzzles and pursue his true
love.

<P>
With the Canadian wine industry gaining recognition both domestically
and internationally, this new &quot;docutainment&quot; style half
hour series that highlights Canadian wine, comes at a perfect
time. <I><B>The New World Wine Tour - Niagara </B></I>premieres
<U>Sunday, September 3, 1995, 5:00 - 5:30 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.
<P>
Demonstrating neither the pretentiousness or pompous rituals that
are so often associated with wine tasters, host <B>Jonathan Welsh</B>
(<I>E.N.G., Adderly</I>), explores the world of wine and great
food on the <I><B>The New World Wine Tour - Niagara. </B></I>Each
week Jonathan welcomes a different celebrity or personality as
his guest for dinner. Some of the celebrity guests include <B>Red
Green, Pierre Berton, Dinah Christie, Camila Scott </B>and <B>Silkan
Laumann</B>. Additionally, Jonathan is joined by Canadian viticulturists
and wine makers who provide candid insight on what it is that
differentiates one wine from another.
<P>
&quot;Our hope is that this series will blow the lid off the pretentious
snobbery that has deprived the average television viewer from
enjoying the wine experience,&quot; expresses executive producer,
Alan Aylward.
<P>
Produced on location in the Niagara region, each episode also
includes a featured chef who prepares a cuisine of locally grown
food products that compliment the chosen wines.
<P>
In the words of Jonathan Welsh, &quot;it's a tough job, but someone
has to do it!&quot;
<P>
Designed to inform and entertain, this new half hour show will
tempt the tastebuds of anyone from wine novice to wine enthusiast.
<I><B>The New World Wine Tour - Niagara</B></I> makes its debut

<P>
For the third consecutive year, Hamilton based radio station <B>Classic
Rock Y95 </B>launched a southwestern Ontario search for new, up
and coming Canadian rock talent. The result is a one hour special
highlighting the four finalists in the competition. <I><B>Y95
Future Classics '95 </B></I>airs <U>Saturday, July 22, 1995, (8:00-9:00
p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV </B>simulcast with <B>Y95</B>.
<P>
&quot;Hamilton has always had a reputation for fostering hot new
rock and roll talents and this year is no exception,&quot; expresses
<B>CHCH </B>producer Stephen Benedict.
<P>
Over 200 hopefuls -- all from Southern Ontario, entered this year's
<I><B>Y95 Future Classics '95 </B></I>competition. The judges,
which included radio programmers, representatives from the recording
industry as well as the public, selected four finalists from the
entries: <B>Total Stranger, All Good Children, The Walk </B>and
<B>Blackwood. </B>They performed June 15, 1995, at Hamilton's
Monopoli Club where the winner (Blackwood) received $25,000 in
cash and prizes. <B>Y95</B>'s &quot;Future Classics '95,&quot;
a compact disc compilation featuring the top 12 finalists, is
available soon at the <B>Y95 </B>World Headquarters.
<P>
&quot;The level of musical and performing talent in our listening/viewing
area is second to none,&quot; says David Foreman, program director
at <B>Classic Rock Y95</B>. &quot;It's a privilege to watch young
rising Canadian talent on their way to achieving their goals.&quot;
<P>
Tune in for all the exhilarating highlights of <I><B>Y95 Future
Classics, </B></I><U>Saturday, July 22, 1995, at 8:00 p.m.</U>,

<tr><td><H3>Signing Ceremony of Olefin/Acetylene Supply Contarcts between Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore with Downstream Companies (Complex Spokesman's Presentation)</H3><p></td></tr>
<tr><td>Welcome to this signing ceremony of the Olefin/Acetylene Supply Contracts between Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore (Private) Limited (PCS) with:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Polyolefin Company (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. (TPC)
<LI>Phillips Petroleum Singapore Chemicals (Private) Limited (PPSC)
<LI>Denka Singapore Private Limited (DSPL) and
<LI>Seraya Chemicals Singapore (Private) Limited (SCSL)<p>
</UL>
Since its start-up ten years ago in 1984, the existing S$2 billion Singapore Petrochemical Complex ("Complex I"), comprising 8 companies has successfully established itself as a highly competitive and reliable petrochemical supplier of high quality, superior grade products in ASEAN countries and the region with an average annual sales turnover of over S$1.8 billion, generated by 1,072 strong workforce.</H4><P>
<A NAME=appendix_1><A HREF=/news/cmplx-i.html>Appendix 1 - Scheme of 1st Petrochemical Complex</A>(15.7 KB GIF)</a><p>
Demand for petrochemical products in the fast developing Asia Pacific region is expected to grow continuously at a higher rate than the world average.  This strong and growing demand provides many opportunities for the Complex to strengthen its regional market presence strategically through the expansion of existing capacities and development of more new high value-added products. Initial feasibility studies to explore these opportunities started in 1990. <p>
The subsequent encouraging results led to further detailed studies being undertaken in which more concrete plans were made as to the types and capacities of plants required.  The conclusion reached at the end of these studies have again shown that the projects are viable.
<p>So, ladies & gentlemen, after a gestation period of some four years, we are proud to announce today that the boards of the various shareholders for the different plants have given their approvals for the go-ahead of the respective projects in the second Petrochemical Complex.<P>
The proposal is for the establishment of a second integrated petrochemical complex (Complex II) on Pulau Ayer Merbau and Pulau Seraya.<p>
This will involve the expansion at Pulau Ayer Merbau of existing plants of <A HREF=#PCS>PCS</A>, <A HREF=#TPC>TPC</A>, <A HREF=#PPSC>PPSC</A>, <A HREF=#DSPL>DSPL</A> and the establishment of a new downstream styrene monomer (SM) and propylene oxide (PO) complex at Pulau Seraya under <A HREF=#SCSL>SCSL</A>.<p>
<A NAME=appendix_2><A HREF=/news/cmplx-ii.html>Appendix 2 - Scheme of 2nd Petrochemical Complex</A>(14.3 KB GIF)</a><p>
The feedstock and product inter-links for the Complex II between PCS-II and the
downstream companies are shown in Appendix 2.  There will also be synergy between Complex II and the Complex I as the operations of the existing plants and facilities will complement that of the new Complex and vice versa.  As such, the addition of Complex II will serve to enhance the overall competitiveness of the Singapore Petrochemical Complex and make it a truly world-scale Complex in the Asia Pacific region.<P>

<td>PCS, a 50/50 joint-venture between the Japanese consortium led by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd, and Shell Overseas Investments B.V., as the upstream company, will construct a second naphtha cracker to produce as main products ethylene and propylene and other byproducts such as acetylene.  Associated BTX and C4-stream derivatives plants (MTBE, butene-1) as well as utilities and common service facilities for the new Complex II will also be built.  This new cracker will be a world-scale plant with average annual capacities of around 428,000 metric tons of ethylene and about 214,000 metric tons of propylene - this represents a doubling of the Company's present capacity.  It will considerably enhance the competitive position of PCS and will provide increased flexibility to the whole Complex.<P></td></tr>

<td>TPC, a 70/30 joint venture between Nihon-Singapore Polyolefin Company Limited, a consortium of large Japanese petrochemical companies, led by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. and Shell Overseas Investment B.V., will also increase its capacity by 190,000 metric tons per year of low density polyethylene/linear low density polyethylene (LDPE/LLDPE) and 120,000 metric tons of polypropylene.  Apart from the improved economics of scale, this will provide TPC with the flexibility to improve the range of products.  Technology will be supplied by Sumitomo Chemical.<p></td></tr>

Ltd. and will expand its capacity of linear polyethylene by 200,000 metric tons per year.  This new facility will provide an excellent opportunity for PPSC to strengthen and expand its top producer position throughout the Asian market.  The linear polyethylene process is based on Phillips Petroleum technology.<p></td></tr>

<td>The Shell Companies in Singapore will be constructing a SM/PO manufacturing complex on Pulau Seraya.  This complex will consist of an SM/PO plant producing styrene monomer and propylene oxide, a Polyols plant and a Monopropylene Glycol (MPG) plant. The last two plants will draw their basic feedstocks from the SM/PO plant.  These plants will bring to the existing petrochemical complex new technology and new product lines drawing on Shell's experience at its existing SM/PO plant in Moerdijk, the Netherlands.<p>
The SM/PO plant will thus be a new downstream plant for PCS which will be the main supplier of feedstocks (ethylene, propylene and benzene) to this plant.  The plant is a joint venture facility operating under the name of "Seraya Chemicals Singapore (Pte) Ltd.", a company to be owned, through their respective pioneer companies, 70% by Shell companies in Singapore and 30% by Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (MPCL) of Japan.  The plant will have a production capacity of 315,000 metric tons per year of styrene monomer and 140,000 metric tons per year of propylene oxide.<p>
The other two plants in the SM/PO complex, polyols and MPG, will be 100% owned by Shell Companies in Singapore. Polyols capacity will be 78,000 metric tons per year and MPG capacity, 30,000 metric tons per year.<p></td></tr>

All these investments are a further testimony of the confidence which our shareholders from Japan, Europe, US and Singapore have in Singapore and this region.  Total investments of Complex II projects is estimated at S$3.4 billion and the projects are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 1997.  It is estimated that there will be additional 525 new employees.<P>
Today's signing ceremony represents an important milesone for the next phase of growth for the Singapore Petrochemical Complex, or for that matter, the local petrochemical industry.  The signing of these supply and offtake contracts signifies the first step towards the creation of Complex II through the cementing of the crucial links between PCS and the downstream companies involved.  In parallel, each company is also finalizing its financing and constructions arrangements and these are expected to be concluded soon to round off the first stage of the project's implementation.<P>
I would now like to call on Mr Yeo Cheow Tong, the Minister for Trade & Industry to say a few words before the formal signing of the contracts.<P>

        <td colspan="2"><font size="2" face="Arial">Sumitomo
        Chemical Company, Limited today announced its
        non-consolidated interim financial results for the six
        months ended September 30, 1996. Net sales for the period
        amounted to &yen;298.1 billion ($2,686 million), a 3%
        increase over the previous year's corresponding period.
        Net income rose 32% to &yen;5.8 billion ($52 million). </font><p><font
        size="2" face="Arial">Sales in the Basic Chemicals Sector
        slightly decreased from the first half of the previous
        year. The sales of methanol and acrylonitrile dropped due
        to lower sales prices reflecting their declined
        international market prices. The sales growth of the Petrochemicals
        &amp; Plastics Sector recorded 5%. The shipping volume
        increased thanks particularly to the favorable domestic
        demand, although prices for most of the polyolefin
        products stayed at a low level. The sales of styrene
        monomer decreased owing to the decline of market prices
        both in Japan and overseas. The sales in the Fine
        Chemicals Sector increased 4%, mainly because
        photoresists for manufacturing of semi-conductors posted
        a sales growth. The sales in the Agricultural Chemicals Sector
        rose 8%, compared with the first semi-annual period of
        the previous year. Agricultural chemicals and household
        and public hygiene chemicals showed an increase in sales,
        supported by brisk demand both in home and overseas
        markets and, especially in export sales, the stronger
        U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Due, among others,
        to the weaker Japanese yen, the total export sales were &yen;49.3
        billion ($444 million), an increase of 22% from the first
        half of the previous year.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The operating income for
        this period increased 27% to &yen;13.2 billion ($119
        million) from &yen;10.4 billion ($94 million) of the
        previous year's corresponding period. Although operating
        income was adversely affected by such factors as
        increased purchase price of naphtha and decreased selling
        prices of basic chemical and petrochemical products, a
        major part of such loss was offset by increased income
        generated from a larger sales volume with respect to the
        Company's most of the products. Consequently, the
        improvement of the operating income was mainly
        attributable to reduction in raw materials unit
        consumption, labor cost and depreciation &amp; amortization
        expenses.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Company's interest
        expenses, net of dividend and interest income, decreased 35%
        to &yen;2.6 billion ($23 million) from the first half of
        the previous year. Special loss for the period decreased
        significantly because loss on disposal of property, plant
        and equipment decreased and past period service costs of
        employees' pension plan were substantially reduced as a
        result of the previous year's change of the Company's accounting
        policy to expense when accrued. The Company expensed at
        one-time the amount of &yen;8.7 billion ($78 million),
        all of past period service costs of employees' pension
        plan, in the second semi-annual period of the previous
        year. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While the Company has
        decided that no interim dividend will be paid for this
        period, the year-end dividend is expected to be &yen;5,000
        per 1,000 shares.</font></p>

<tr><td colspan=2>Sumitomo Chemical announced today the implementation of Acrylic Acid and MMA Project in Singapore.  The Company will construct production facilities for acrylic acid, its derivatives, MMA monomer and PMMA resins in Pulau Sakra in Singapore with their completion scheduled for July, 1998.<p>
The Company has recently established in Singapore, a wholly owned subsidiary, Sumitomo Chemical Singapore Pte Ltd ("SCS") as a core company of the Project.  The Project will also involve;<p></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan=2>Demands for acrylic acid and its derivatives as well as MMA (both monomer and polymer) showed remarkable growth in recent years in Southeast Asia and will continue to grow in the future.  Thus, the Company has been engaged in the feasibility study of the Project together with the companies with whom the Company has close business relationship on respective products of the Project in Japan and has arrived at affirmative conclusion.<p>
Since early 1980s, the Company has established its presence in Singapore through the petrochemical complex at Pulau Ayer Merbau which consists of an ethylene cracker and downstream polymer plants.  The Company is now proceeding with the second phase expansion of the petrochemical complex due to be completed in the second quarter of 1997.<p>
Pulau Sakra is located in the south of Pulau Ayer Merbau and both islands are positioned as a core of Jurong Chemical Island Project of Singapore Government.  These two islands are now connected with causeway and pipeline-supply of the raw materials from the petrochemical complex at Pulau Ayer Merbau will provide competitiveness to the Acrylic Acid and MMA Project in Pulau Sakra.<p>
The Company intends to develop Pulau Sakra Complex as its second production center in Southeast Asia and accelerate its business globalization.</td></tr>

<caption><H2>1996 Investors Information</h2></caption>
<tr><td width=120 align=left valign=top><h3>Introduction</H3></td>
<td width=480>Sumitomo Chemical Company, Limited is one of the leading chemical companies in Japan and has been supplying to the marketplace products of diverse fields ranging from petrochemicals, aluminium to specialty chemicals such as dyestuff, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. We believe our business activities have contributed in various ways to the development of industries and society. Our company will never abate its endeavour to continue supplying those products that our customers most require.<p>
Recently the Japanese economy has shown a moderate recovery from the longest postwar recession. In fiscal 1995, Sumitomo Chemical achieved an improved performance in profits, owing to cost cutting efforts as well as reflecting a rapid economic growth in Asia.  However, various structural changes are taking place not only in the Japanese chemical industry but also on a global scale, for the purpose of rationalising non-profitable operations and focusing on core businesses. <p>
To increase profitability and enhance competitiveness, we are promoting the restructuring of our business activities through strategic alliances with others as well as its internal efforts for cost reduction particularly in Basic Chemicals & Petrochemicals. Also in Specialty Chemicals, we will further expand overseas operations and diversify our business stronghold in the world market .<p></td></tr>

<H3 align=center>Sumitomo Chemical to Start the Production<br>of Photoresists in South Korea</H3><p>

<center>
<TABLE width=500>
<TR><TD>Sumitomo Chemical today announced planned construction of a new plant to produce photoresists, a photo-sensitive material used for semiconductor production, in the Republic of Korea.  The new plant employing Sumitomo's state-of-the-art technology will have an initial capacity of about 100 thousand gallons per year of i-line photoresists and is scheduled to come on stream in the summer of 1997.<p>
Sumitomo Chemical has extensive activities in the field of photoresist business, with its special strength in advanced i-line photoresists for LSIs use.  The Company has been strengthening its sales/marketing bases in Southeast Asia, North America and Europe, as well as in Japan, to promote its photoresist business globally.<p>
As the world semiconductor industry is shifting its focus beyond 64 megabit DRAM, demand for higher quality electronic materials such as i-line photoresists is expected to grow acceleratedly.  Witnessing particularly rapid expansion of the Korean semiconductor industry, the Company anticipates that the new plant in South Korea will effectively meet such growing customer demands, ensuring increased customer satisfaction.<p>
The new plant will be constructed and operated by our joint venture company Dong Woo Pure Chemicals, who will also sell photoresists produced at the plant in the Korean market. <p></TD></TR>

<H3 align=center>Significant Surge in Sumitomo Chemical's Consolidated Income</H3><p>
<center>
<table width=500>
<tr><td>Sumitomo Chemical Company, Limited today announced that its consolidated net income was &#165;18.5 billion ($174 million) for a year ended March 31, 1996 (FY95), an increase of 108.9% from &#165;8.9 billion ($83 million) for a year ended December 31, 1994 (FY94, the latest comparable fiscal year).  Although the net sales decreased 2.7%, from the level of FY94, to &#165;951.9 billion ($8,951 million), the operating income increased 51.6 % to &#165;54.8 billion ($515 million).  Annual dividends per 1,000 shares were &#165;3,000 ($28.21), the same amount as for FY94.
<p>The Basic Chemicals & Petrochemicals segment showed a sales growth of 7.0% from FY94, due to increased shipments both in Japan and abroad, as well as price increase especially in the Southeast Asian market.  The sales of the Specialty Chemicals segment and Others segment decreased 11.1% and 3.4%, respectively, compared with FY94.  Sales of pharmaceuticals declined substantially, because the products of two affiliate Company's subsidiary, started to be sold directly by themselves, beginning 1995.  Overseas operations of the Company grew 20.7% from FY94, thanks to a favorable market situation of polyolefins in Southeast Asia and active exports of agrochemical products despite the yen staying stronger on an annual average. 
<p>Total operating income was &#165;54.8 billion ($515 million), an increase of 51.6% from FY94.  Segmentwise, the Basic Chemicals & Petrochemicals recorded the operating income of &#165;13.8 billion ($130 million), an improvement of &#165;13.6 billion ($128 million) from the FY94's corresponding figure of &#165;0.3 billion ($2 million). The Specialty Chemicals segment also showed  an increase of 16.4% to &#165;36.6 billion ($344 million) in operating income.  The operating income of the Others segment was &#165;4.2 billion ($40 million), the same level as FY94.  <p>
The gain on sale of securities was &#165;1.3 billion ($12 million), a significant decrease from &#165;6 billion ($57 million) in FY94.  The gain on sale of property posted &#165;3.1 billion ($29 million),a slight increase from &#165;2.4 billion ($22 million ) in FY94.  The interest expenses decreased further 9.9% to &#165;25.1 billion ($236 million), and interest and dividend income also declined 8.3% to &#165;8.7 billion ($82 million).  As a result, the Company's financial balance improved by &#165;2.0 billion ($18 million) to a negative amount of &#165;16.4 billion ($154 million).<p>
<B>Basic Chemicals & Petrochemicals:</B><p>
The operating income ratio improved to 2.9% in FY95 compared with 0.1% in FY94.  Although the Japanese basic chemicals and petrochemicals market showed a recovery, sales prices of major plastic products remained at a low level throughout FY95.  The segment's profitability, however, improved owing to the Company's continued cost reduction efforts and the increased operating rate of domestic plants, coupled with higher prices of polyolefin products in the Southeast Asia market in the first half of 1995.<p>
<B>Specialty Chemicals:</B><p>
The operating income ratio of this segment also improved to 8.1% in FY95, compared with 6.2% in FY94, despite a large sales drop in pharmaceuticals.  The profitability of this segment increased due to the larger sales volume of agrochemical products, the weakened yen in the second half of FY95 and continued cost reduction.  The expanded sales of photoresist for super-LSI manufacturing and epoxy resins for semi-conductor encapsulation also contributed to the improvement of business performance.<p>
<B>Others:</B><p>
The operating income ratio of this segment was 13.9%, almost the same as FY94.  This  business segment engages in, among others, electricity supply, engineering for plant construction, chemical analysis, and cargo transportation.<br>
Effective 1995, the Company changed its business year from a calendar year to a year ending March 31. The transitional period which comprises three months, from January 1995 to March 1995, is omitted from all of the following analysis and accordingly data were compared with those of FY94 ,the latest comparable year. <p></td></tr>

<tr><td>The non-consolidated financial results of Sumitomo Chemical Company, Limited for FY95 were announced at the same time; net sales increased 3.5% from FY94 to &#165;579.8 billion ($5,452 million), operating income was &#165;24.6 billion ($231 million), ordinary income was &#165;21.3 billion ($200 million), and on an after-tax basis, the net income was reported as &#165;9.0 billion ($84 million).<p>
Sales increased 5.2% in the Basic Chemicals & Petrochemicals segment due mainly to the increased shipment and the higher sales price of styrene monomer and raw materials for synthetic fibers in the Japanese and Southeast Asian markets.  Although the sales volume of polyolefin products increased reflecting the recovered demand, their prices remained at a low level in the domestic market.  Sales of the Specialty Chemicals segment were almost the same as FY94.  The sales of chemicals and materials for the electronics industry and agrochemical products showed a steady growth.  The sales of dyestuffs decreased owing to lower selling prices caused by the strong yen and fierce competition in the Asian market.  The Company's export sales increased 9.8% to &#165;88.8 billion ($835 million). <p>
The operating income increased from &#165;2.3 billion ($21 million) in FY94 to &#165;24.6 billion  ($231 million) in FY95, because of reduced cost and expenses in depreciation, research and transportation.  In addition, an increased sales volume and a higher rate of plant operation also contributed to the profitability improvement.  For FY95, the Company posted a small gain on sale of securities.  In contrast, for FY94, the Company recorded the income of &#165;7.9 billion ($74 million) on the sale of securities.  <p>
The Company has changed its accounting policy for the past period service costs of employee's pension plan and income taxes.  The past period service costs of the Company's contributory pension plan, which in prior years were expensed at the time of contribution, were fully amortized at the beginning of FY95 and incurring past period service costs in the future are expensed when accrued.  In addition, commencing FY95, the Company has provided for tax effects on those gains from sale of property, plant and equipment upon which taxation is deferred if special purpose reserve is set aside from the unappropriated retained earnings in accordance with corporate tax law. These changes brought down the net income by &#165;8.7 billion ($81 million) and &#165;4.0 billion ($38 million), respectively.</td></tr>

<TD>Sumitomo Chemical, in the belief that its future also hinges on the development of new technologies, has been channeling a great amount of effort into research and development.<p>
At present, Sumitomo Chemical, the parent company, has ten research laboratories in Japan, five of which belong to relevant Business Sectors of the Company.  The laboratories conduct R&#38;D on processes, products and their applications, based on the Sector's business directions and strategies.  The other five laboratories implement R&#38;D in areas common to several Business Sectors or explore new and long-term subjects which do not specifically belong to any Business Sector at the moment but may well be future growth areas. </TD>

<tr><td colspan=2>Sumitomo Chemical started business activities in Ehime Prefecture in 1913.<P>
Around that time, Besshi Copper Mine in Ehime Prefecture was faced with a difficult problem of how to treat sulfur dioxide gas generated in the copper smelting. To ease the problem by manufacturing calcium super phosphate, which is a fertilizer, using by-produced sulfur dioxide gas, Sumitomo Fertilizer Manufacturing Company was established, which is a predecessor of the present Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.<P>
Ever since, Sumitomo Chemical has always taken a leading role in the Japanese chemical industry with the strong belief that to realize "quality assurance", "safety management", "environmental control" and "global environment protection" is indispensable for contributing to society and conducting corporate activities on a stable foundation.<P>
These four elements are closely interrelated, and their scientific and integrated management is required in every aspect of a company's operation such as research & development, manufacture, product distribution, sales, follow-up services and final disposal.<P>
Each Business Sector of the Company is making these efforts under "Corporate Policy on Product Quality, Safety and Environment". Besides, there are special committees consisting of Board Members responsible for each Business Sector such as "Quality Committee", "Responsible Care Committee" and "Global Environment Protection Committee", which comprehensively support and promote the Company's activities. Many achievements have already been yielded.<P>
As a Japan's leading chemical company which assumes responsibility for having the present prosperity inherited to our future generations, Sumitomo Chemical will combine all of its technological expertise and contribute to better product quality, safety and preservation of environment.<P></td></tr>

Throughout history, people have created new ways to live by developing innovative, unique technologies.  Sumitomo Chemical, in the belief that its future also hinges on the development of new technologies, has been channeling a great amount of effort into research and development.<p>
At present, Sumitomo Chemical has ten research laboratories in Japan, five of which belong to relevant Business Sectors of the Company.  Called Business Sector Laboratories, they conduct R&D on processes, products and their applications, based on the Sectors' business directions and strategies.  The other five laboratories, called Corporate Research Laboratories, conduct R&D in areas common to several Business Sectors or explore new and long-term subjects which do not specifically belong to any Business Sector at the moment but may well be future growth areas.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Diminution of tropical forest and accelerated desertification of dry lands are becoming a serious problem. It is said that each year the earth is losing forests corresponding to an are a half the size of Japan's main island. A cause for the forest disappearance is deemed to be the expansion of upland farming and felling of timber.<p>
Unabated destruction of tropical forests inhibits their mechanism of carbon dioxide absorption and release of oxygen into the air, causing the acceleration of the earth warming. The development of desertification also causes a loss of trees and forests. Sumitomo Chemical is determined to make a contribution in this field.<P></td></tr>

<dt><B>1. Products for the use of re-generated paper to protect forest resources</B><p>
<DD>The paper re-generation is being encouraged to reduce the felling of forest resources for pulp and paper. Sumitomo Chemical manufactures a paper strength improving agent called "Sumirez Resin" for re-generated paper. The product promotes the use of re-generated paper and con-tribute to the preservation of invaluable forest resources.<P>
<dt><B>2. Development of environmentally-friendly pesticides</B><p>
<DD>Pesticides and fertilizers are indispensable for the protection and cultivation of agricultural crops and forests. For example, the Company's insecticide "Sumithion" contributed greatly to the control of desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) of which plague occurred mainly in Africa in 1988. At that time, the pesticide has obtained confirmation by FAO and WHO to be effective and safe. Sumitomo Chemical gives first priority to the development of products which are safe and friendly to environment.<P>
Besides, the Company's recent efforts are made not only for conventional pesticides such as insecticides, fungicides and herbicides, but also for a new type of agents which utilizes the ecological mechanism of plants and animals. Those products already developed include plant growth regulators "Sumiseven" and "Lomica" and an insect growth regulator "Sumilarv".<P>
<dt><B>3. Desert greenification project utilizing super water absorption resin</B><p>
<DD>Super water absorption resin, which is used for such products as paper diaper, absorbs water of several hundreds to a thousand as much as its own weight. The Japanese government, in cooperation with the Egyptian government, has conducted, as part of MITI's "Green Earth Plan", a national project in which this super water absorption resin was used, as a water retention agent, for desert greenification or promotion of agriculture in dry lands. Sumitomo Chemical participated actively in this project by providing its super water absorption resin "Igeta Gel FS". <P>

<dt><B>1. Technologies for air pollution prevention</B><p>
<DD>The combustion of oil and coal generates NOx and Sox which affect human health adversely and cause acid rain. Sumitomo Chemical developed technologies for the removal of NOx and SOx back in 1970's and has not only adopted them in its own plants, but also licensed the technologies to companies both at home and abroad.<P>
<dt><B>2. Reduction of CO2 emission by an energy-saving process</B><p>
<DD>Sumitomo Chemical developed and improved many manufacturing processes for products such as isobutylene, gas-phase polypropylene and gas-phase linear low density polyethylene, which have led to energy saving, resources saving and eventually the reduction of CO2 emission.<P>
Besides, the Company has recently been active in the development of bio-reactor which enables normal temperature and pressure chemical reactions, which used to be realized only under high temperature and high pressure. The bio reactor has already yielded significant achievements, e.g. the manufacturing processes of active ingredients for household insecticides.<p>
<dt><B>3. Development of light-weight materials which contribute to emission gas reduction of automobiles</B><p>
<DD>Car weight reduction improves fuel consumption efficiency and results in the decrease of NOx, SOx or CO2 emission. Sumitomo Chemical, utilizing its comprehensive technological capability, is developing light-weight materials such as high-performance plastics such as polymer alloy or fiber-reinforced composite materials based on carbon fiber, alumina fiber and aramid fiber.<P>
<dt><B>4. CO2 fixation by biotechnology</B><p>
<DD>Sumitomo Chemical participates in a government-project sponsored by New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) which aims to enhance the photo-synthesis capability of algae by biotechnology and thereby fix carbon dioxide. Besides, the Company is working on the breeding of plants which perform photo-synthesis efficiently even under severe conditions such as those in cold-weather areas or dry lands.<P>

<tr><td>The United Nations, in its report of 1987 titled "Our Common Future", indicated the principle of "Sustainable Development", the development to satisfy the needs of the present generation without impairing those of our future generations. This message means that we have great responsibility for the future. The development of science and technology has enriched our life substantially. <p>
On the other hand, we have suffered from various problems such as deterioration of the ecological balance among microorganisms, plants, animals and human beings, food crisis, local environmental pollution and, on a much broader scale, global environment deterioration. We should not allow further destruction of the earth's environment in return for the benefit of economic development.<P>
Sumitomo Chemical recognizes the importance of these issues and is performing its business activities fulfilling social responsibility and giving due consideration to those problems.<p></td></tr>

<dt><B>1. Enhanced activities of the Company's Environmental Health Science Laboratory</B><p>
<DD>Chemical substances developed for benefit to human life may affect adversely human health or environment depending on their properties, method of use and dosage. Sumitomo Chemical has strengthened its Environmental Health Science Laboratory recently to enhance its capability to develop products with the highest priority on friendliness to the environment and safety.<P>
<dt><B>2. Products to improve life environment</B><p>
<DD>In developing countries, many people are still suffering from diseases carried by pests such as malaria and denguefever. Further, the deterioration of urban environment has increasingly made it necessary to control pests such as flies, mosquitoes and cockroaches. Sumitomo Chemical has world-renowned technologies in this field. One of most notable is proprietary insecticide "Sumithion" which was recommended by WHO as an agent to control mosquitoes carrying malaria. A recent example of success is the development of an agent which effectively controls tsetse flies. The Company has thus received good reputation worldwide for its contributions in solving these problems.<P>
<dt><B>3. Plastics recycling technology</B><p>
<DD>Spurred by a surging public awareness of environmental problems, efforts are being made to promote the recycling of plastic wastes or their use as fuel sources. Sumitomo Chemical, as a Japan's leading plastics manufacturer, setup the "Committee for Plastics Recycling" in July 1991and is working actively on the development of molding processing methods suitable for utilization of re-generated plastics and development of easy-to-recycle plastics.</DL>

<h3 align=center>Coporate History</h3><p>

<table width=500>
<td>The history of Sumitomo Chemical dates back to 1913, when its predecessor, the House of Sumitomo, worked to ease an environmental problem caused by sulfur dioxide emissions from its operation of the Besshi Copper Mine in Japan's Ehime Prefecture, and constructed a fertilizer plant to produce calcium superphosphate fertilizers from the sulfur dioxide. This fertilizer plant was the beginning of Sumitomo Chemical's business.<p>
<img src="../jpeg/history1.jpg" align="right" hspace=5 vspace=5>
Since its incorporation, Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. has continued to explore new business opportunities to meet the changing needs of customers and society. The first step was expansion into the production of ammonia and related basic industrial chemicals in the 1930s by making the best use of fertilizer byproducts. In 1944, Sumitomo Chemical acquired Japan Dyestuff Manufacturing Company, setting up a base for its fine chemical businesses such as dyestuffs, agricultural chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. The Company took over the aluminum business of Sumitomo Aluminium Smelting Co. in 1949 to meet growing demand for aluminum products. In the mid-1950s, Japan's economic development brought about the need to develop a competitive petrochemical industry in the nation. Sumitomo Chemical began petrochemical operations in 1958 by establishing one of Japan's first petrochemical complexes in Ehime Prefecture. Successfully expanding this business, the Company set up its second petrochemical complex in Chiba Prefecture, near Tokyo, in 1965, with integrated, large-scale operation. Sumitomo Chemical thus developed into a full-fledged chemical company providing a broad range of chemical products. The Company took initiative in helping the Japanese chemical industry to grow into a pillar sector that supported the rapid economic growth in Japan from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s.<p>

Entering the 1980s, Sumitomo Chemical enhanced its efforts to gain world-class competitiveness. The Company's petrochemical operations were all consolidated in Chiba to achieve more integrated and efficient product development and manufacturing operations. The Company also joined the Petrochemical Complex in Singapore, a Japan-Singapore economic cooperation project, where the Company continues to play a leading role. The operation started in 1984 and has become the Company's stronghold for overseas expansion. The complex will double its production capacity in 1997 under its Second-Phase Expansion Project to meet growing demand in Asia. Sumitomo Chemical further expanded its business activities to North America. Phillips Sumika Polypropylene Co., a joint venture with Phillips Petroleum Company, based in Houston, Texas, U.S.A., will start the operation of a new plant for the manufacture of polypropylene in 1996. In the aluminum business, Sumitomo Chemical shifted its aluminum smelting activities overseas in 1986 to sustain cost-competitiveness.<p>
Also epitomizing Sumitomo Chemical's efforts to achieve world-class competitiveness are its fine chemical businesses. As for agricultural chemicals, Sumitomo Chemical supplies proprietary products from Japan to customers in over 110 countries. The Company also has overseas affiliates such as Valent U.S.A. Corporation and Philagro France.  The Company has fortified its dyestuff marketing operations in Asia and Europe by opening marketing and technical support centers in Singapore and Belgium in 1994. To gain greater efficiency and flexibility, Sumitomo Chemical consolidated its pharmaceutical operations with the pharmaceutical division of Inabata & Co., Ltd., an affiliated trading company, forming Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. in 1984. Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals has become one of Japan's top ten pharmaceutical companies. This company strives to develop new products and technologies through international alliances and cooperation with companies and institutions around the world.<p>
<img src="../jpeg/history2.jpg" align="right" hspace=5 vspace=5><p>
One of the philosophies of Sumitomo Chemical is to live and prosper in harmony with society. This philosophy is reflected in the Company's long-term commitment to safety, health, and the environment. Since its inception, Sumitomo Chemical has endeavored to ensure safety and minimize the impact of its operations on public health and the environment. The Company has achieved this by developing efficient production processes, implementing stringent safety and pollution control measures, and promoting global environmental protection.<p>
Growing globally and acting responsibly, Sumitomo Chemical will continue to provide high-quality, innovative products and create more value for customers worldwide.</td></tr>

<tr><td width=5%><br></td>
<td>Some rice cultivars which have high quality in taste like Koshihikari, have a tendency to lodge at the harvest season. These varieties require such fertilization as to prevent lodging.  "Sumishort" is a new fertilizer containing "Uniconazole-P" as plant growth retardant developed by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.<br>
Applied to rice plants at panicle formation stage, about 25 days before heading, "Sumishort" reduces the culm length which results not only in less lodging but also in more yield. The amount of fertilizer applied at this stage varies depending on cultivar, property of the soil and climate conditions of the field. To meet every possible environmental conditions, 5 types of "Sumishort" are prepared, for farmers choice.<br>
In this report we show the summarized data of 229 field experiments at official and private stations throughout Japan except Hokkaido conducted between 1985 and 1992, and a new design of fertilization is proposed for cultivars with a tendency to lodge.<p></td></tr>

<td>High concentration of the phytohormone 2,4-D induces somatic embryos on immature soybean seed.  They are capable of proliferation and regenerating to mature plants, and are suitable target for gene transfer experiments.  We established an efficient transformation method for soybean using particle gun, which is a device to deliver DNA-coated gold particles (up to 1 micron m) to plant cells by air-pressure power.  In this system, a constructed plasmid pSUM-GH containing both GUS reporter gene and hygromycin resistant gene as a selectable marker was bombarded on somatic embryos.  Selected hygromycin resistant embryos showed strong GUS activity and regenerated to transgenic plants.  In order to apply this transformation system to modify soybean seed quality, we constructed a seed-specific expression vector pSUM-GY1.  The GUS gene cloned into the vector exhibited high level of expression in developing seed but neither in leaves nor in germinating seed.  This vector will be a powerful tool to alter agronomic characteristics of soybean.<p></td></tr>

<table width=500>
<tr><td>Sumitomo Chemical Company, Limited announced today that it has reached agreement with a U.K. pharmaceutical company Amersham International Plc (&quot;Amersham&quot;) to strengthen their collaboration in Nihon Medi-Physics (&quot;NMP&quot;) in the diagnostic pharmaceutical field.  Amersham, currently 20% shareholder of NMP will raise its shareholding to 50% and at the same time will integrate into NMP its diagnostic pharmaceutical operation in Japan now conducted by its subsidiary, Amersham Kabushiki Kaisha (&quot;AKK&quot;).<p>
In 1994, Sumitomo and Amersham entered into a collaboration with the intent to integrate eventually the diagnostics operation of NMP and AKK.  As a first step, Amersham acquired 20% of NMP's outstanding shares and since then, both companies have discussed to the details of the second-phase cooperation for the equal partnership in NMP.<p>
The merger of Amersham's Japanese diagnostics operation with NMP will take place as of 1 September 1996.  For the increase of Amersham's shareholding, certain shares owned by Sumitomo and Sumitomo Corporation will be transferred to Amersham in October 1996. <p>
Closer alliance with Amersham will bring forth synergistic benefit to NMP and contribute to reinforcing and broadening the lineup of quality products which will be supplied to the diagnostics market in Japan.</td></tr>

<H3 align=center>Sumitomo Chemical Company, Limited<BR>
1995 Non-consolidated Interim Financial Results</H3><P>
<center>
<table width=500>
<tr><td>Sumitomo Chemical Company, Limited today announced its non-consolidated interim financial results for the six months ended September 30, 1995.  Net sales for the period were 289.3 billion yen ($2,919 million), and net income for the period was 4.4 billion yen ($44 million). The Company has decided that no interim dividend will be paid for this period. Starting 1995, the Company changed its business year from calendar year to a year ending March 31. As a result, the financial results for the first half of the fiscal 1995 are not comparative to those for the first half of 1994.  <P>
In the Basic Chemicals Sector, the sale of raw materials for synthetic fiber were brisk due to higher selling prices reflecting strong demand in the domestic and Southeast Asian markets. The selling price of aluminium also remained high throughout this period. Optically functional films for LC displays showed a steady sales growth. In the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector, although prices for most of the plastics had stayed at a low level since 1994, the shipping volume increased due mainly to strong demand from domestic customers. The sales of styrene monomer increased thanks to higher market price in both Japan and overseas. In the Fine Chemicals Sector, the sales of dyestuffs, organic intermediates and additives were stagnant because of the unfavorable influence from the strong yen and lower demand. Super-engineering plastics, photoresists (for large-scale integrated circuits) and epoxy resins recorded expanded sales due to strong demand from the semiconductor industry. In the Agricultural Chemicals Sector, household insecticides showed a solid performance, and the export of agrochemical products increased despite the yen appreciation. <P>
The Company recorded an operating income of 10.4 billion yen ($105 million) and the operating income ratio of 3.6% for the first half of 1995. The operating income ratio improved from its corresponding figure of 0.4% for the twelve months of 1994. This improvement was mainly attributable to an increase in production volume and cost reduction effect principally in raw materials cost, transportation cost and depreciation. <P>
The Company's interest and dividend income was 4.6 billion yen ($46 million) and the interest expense was 8.6 billion  yen($86 million). Although the Company sold a part of its portfolio with a gain on the sale of securities amounting to 7.9 billion yen ($80 million) in 1994, no gain on the sale of securities was reported in 1995.</td></tr>

December 8, 1994<p>

<H3 align=center>Sumitomo Chemical and Okura Industrial To Form <br>Joint Venture on Functional Packaging Material</H3><p>
<center>
<table width=500>
<tr><td colspan=2>Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., a leading Japanese synthetic resin manufacturer (Head Office: Osaka, President: Akio Kosai), and Okura Industrial Co. Ltd., the largest synthetic resin processor in Japan (Head Office: Marugame, Kagawa, President: Yukiharu Kume) have agreed to establish a 50/50 joint venture to manufacture and sell <A HREF="#ewoutline">highly functional packaging materials</A>.<P>
The new company, called <A HREF="#jvoutline">"Nihon Ecowrap Co., Ltd."</A>, will build a 2,000 tons/year plant to manufacture tubular biaxially oriented film within the Chunan Factory of Okura Industrial in Chunan, Kagawa Prefecture, Japan.  After its completion in February, 1995, the plant will immediately start the commercial production of two types of shrinkable films, one with stretchability (Tradename: Ecowrap SS) and the other with gas-barrier properties (Tradename: Ecowrap EX).  Subsequently, the joint venture intends to launch a shrinkable film which has both stretchability and gas-barrier properties (Tradename: Ecowrap BSS) and further, by the fall of 1995, new products having much enhanced properties such as gas barrier for specialized applications.<P>
Traditionally, it has not been a general practice in Japan for resin manufactures and resin processors to cooperate closely for the joint development of processed resin products.  The Sumitomo-Okura collaboration is a departure from such practice and, through vertical integration of their respective strengths, provides various advantages such as reducing the duplication of enormous development costs hitherto incurred by resin manufacturers and processors, shortening time for product commercialization and developing functional packaging materials which will meet diverse needs of customers.  The two companies believe that the joint venture will be able to conduct the packaging materials business efficiently and effectively with improved competitiveness in the workplace.<P>
In Japan, the Food Sanitation Law was amended in March 1993 to tighten control over possible contamination of foods by microorganisms.  This move has urged supermarkets to change the wrapping practice of tray packages for processed meat products, raw meat, etc. from on-the-spot wrapping at each supermarket to centralized wrapping at distribution centers or food production sites.  Such wrapping requires the use of high-speed automated packaging machines, for which highly functional films with stretchabiliy are in increasing demand.<P>
In addition, it is expected that a new government regulation will be enforced next spring to require indicating on a food package a date by which the best taste of the food can be preserved.  Accordingly, demand is growing for packaging materials with superior gas barrier properties, which effectively keep the taste of foods in package.<P>
In anticipation of such trend, Okura has already been conducting a trial marketing of "Ecowrap SS" and "Ecowrap EX".  The new company is therefore now ready to start selling these products commercially upon completion of the manufacturing plant early next year.  The annual sales of the new company are expected to be about five billion yen in three to four years.<P></td></tr>

<dt>(1) Ecowrap SS<p>
<dd>Ecowrap SS is a polyolefin-type shrinkable stretch film suitable for high-speed automated packaging.  Traditionally, wrapping of individual tray packages for foods sold at supermarkets has been conducted at the backyard of each supermarket, using polyvinylchloride-type wrapping film.  Because of the amendment of the Food Sanitation Law to tighten control over possible contamination of foods by microorganisms, coupled with shortage of labor and floor space for wrapping, supermarkets are increasingly adopting centralized wrapping at distribution centers or food production sites by use of high-speed automated packaging machines.  Accordingly, demand is growing for shrink oriented film suitable for such application.  In addition, new applications under development include a packaging material for frozen foods, for which the superior low-temperature properties of Ecowrap SS can be fully utilized.<P>
<dt>(2) Ecowrap EX<p>
<dd>Ecowrap EX is a shrinkable film with gas barrier properties suitable for wrapping of tray packages for processed meat foods such as ham and sausage.  By filling certain types of gas (nitrogen, carbonic acid gas, etc.) into the package, foods inside he package can be kept in good condition for about one month.<P>
<dt>(3) Ecowrap BSS<p>
<dd>Ecowrap BSS is a shrinkable film which has both stretchability and gas barrier properties, most suitable for the packaging of raw meat, cooked food, etc.  The stretchability meets requirements for high-speed automated packaging, while the gas barrier properties are effective in extending, by several days, a period during which the taste of food can be kept at its best.

<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
December 5, 1994<P>
<H3 align=center>Nippon Zeon, Sumitomo Chemical, Tokuyama and Sun Arrow<br>Chemical to Form  New PVC Company<P></h3>
<center>
<table width=500>
<tr><td colspan=2>Nippon Zeon Co., Ltd., Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokuyama Corporation and Sun Arrow Chemical Co., Ltd.,  a wholly owned subsidiary of Tokuyama Corporation, jointly announced today that they have agreed to combine their polyvinylchloride (PVC) businesses by establishing a new joint venture company, which is scheduled to start operation on July 1, 1995.<P>
In March 1982, Nippon Zeon, Sumitomo Chemical and Sun Arrow Chemical along with Kureha Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. jointly incorporated <A HREF=#DAI_ICHI_CO>Dai-Ichi PVC Co., Ltd.</A> for the joint sales and marketing of PVC manufactured by each parent company.  In parallel, the four parent companies pursued joint research as part of their efforts to rationalize the PVC business.  In an attempt to exploit the outcome of the joint research commercially, the four companies together with Dai-Ichi PVC Co., Ltd. formed Dai-Ichi PVC Manufacturing Co., Ltd. in 1990, which built PVC manufacturing facilities with state-of-the-art technology within the Chiba Works of Sumitomo Chemical.<P>
Over the past several years, however, the Japanese PVC industry has been faced with hardships, such as slowdown of demand growth, softening of domestic sales price and rise of raw material cost influenced by overseas market conditions.  Thus, the PVC manufacturers have been suffering from deteriorating profits and even serious financial losses recently.<P>
Under these circumstances, Dai-Ichi PVC group companies have been strenuously exploring ways to maintain the stable supply to customers and meet customer requirements such as quality improvement, further enhancing their PVC businesses in the future.  As a result, the companies have agreed that Nippon Zeon, Sumitomo Chemical and Sun Arrow Chemical will integrate their PVC businesses into a new company which engages in both manufacture and sales.  The new company, with full support from each parent company, is expected to realize a rationalized business operation with improved international competitiveness and to better serve customers in the marketplace.<P></td></tr>

<tr><td><h3>Sumitomo Chemical to Open Dyestuffs Technical Service Center in Belgium</h3></h3><P></td></tr>

<tr><td>Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. announced today that it will open a dyestuffs technical service center in a suburb of Brussels, Belgium in the spring of 1995.<P>
To build the technical service center, the Company has already reached an agreement with CAPA S.A., the Company's dyestuff distributor in Belgium, to acquire necessary facilities such as a laboratory and warehouses from them.<P>
Sumitomo Chemical has been selling over many years various kinds of synthetic dyes in more than 40 countries.  To further expand the dyestuffs business worldwide, the Company is expending active efforts including, most recently, the opening of new dyestuffs technical service units in Osaka, Japan last year and in Singapore through Sumitomo Chemical Asia Pte, Ltd. this September.<P>
In Europe, the Company's dyestuffs business has been promoted by its wholly owned subsidiary Sumitomo Chemical Deutschland GmbH headquartered in Dusseldorf, Germany. To take the global strategy one step further, Sumitomo Chemical has looked into the possibility of reinforcing its technical service capability in Europe by setting up its own dyestuffs laboratory.  The dyestuffs technical service center that the Company will open next year will be operated by <A HREF=#BELGI>Sumitomo Chemical Belgium S.A./N.V.</a>, a subsidiary wholly owned by Sumitomo Chemical Deutschland.  Accordingly, all of the Company's dyestuffs business in Europe, currently undertaken by Sumitomo Chemical Deutschland, will be conducted by Sumitomo Chemical Belgium S.A./N.V. after the technical service center starts its operation.<P>
The Company believes that the integration of marketing force and technical service capability through the Belgian subsidiary will contribute greatly to the further growth of its dyestuffs business in Europe, one of the important dyestuffs markets in the world.<P></td></tr>

<tr><td><H3>Sumitomo Chemical, Itochu and Toyo Shigyo Printing to Form 
<A HREF=#STI_TECH>Color Filter Joint Venture</A></h3><P></td></tr>
<tr><td>Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. (Head office: Osaka, Japan, President: Akio Kosai), Itochu Corporation (Head office: Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, President: Minoru Murofushi) and Toyo Shigyo Printing Co., Ltd. (Head office: Osaka, Japan, President: Tetsuo Asahi) jointly announced today that they have established a joint venture company in Japan to manufacture color filters for thin film transistor (TFT)-type liquid crystal displays (LCDs) using the pigment-contained color photoresist method and sell such color filters.<P>
Named "STI Technology, Inc.", the new company will build a manufacturing plant of color filters for the TFT-type LCDs based on the pigment-contained color photoresist technology, with a monthly capacity of about 200 thousand pieces as a 10 inch-diagonal filter.  The plant will be located within the Ehime Works of Sumitomo Chemical in Niihama, Ehime Pref. and its completion is scheduled for March 1995.  In the meantime, the joint venture will succeed from Toyo Shigyo Printing to its marketing activities of color filters manufactured by Toyo Shigyo Printing on a consignment basis, using the pigment-contained color photoresist method, and start selling the filters under STI Technology's brand name on September 1, 1994.<p>
Sumitomo Chemical, appreciating the large potential market of the LCD-related materials, has long been engaged in the research & development of such materials.  Polarizing and retardation films, which Sumitomo Chemical is now manufacturing and selling, are examples of the outcome of its R&D efforts.  It is along this line of efforts that Sumitomo Chemical has been exploring the possibility of entering the market of color filters manufactured using the pigment-contained color photoresist method, for which a demand is growing significantly over recent years.<P>
Itochu Corporation also has a longtime experience in handling a wide range of electronics-related materials and products, including LCD-related materials, and has identified the color filter business as offering promising opportunities to expand its operations.<P>
Toyo Shigyo Printing has been marketing already a substantial quantity of color filters manufactured through its proprietary pigment-contained color photoresist technology.<P>
The three companies have agreed to combine their technical expertise and marketing strengths, which each has respectively fostered in LCD-related fields, by forming a joint venture which will actively engage in the fast growing LCD color filter market.<P>
The LCD market in Japan, which was estimated at about 500 billion yen in 1993, will reach about 2 trillion yen by 2000, with the advancement of the so-called multimedia society where portable OA equipment and full-color LCDs will be increasingly in widespread use.  In particular, in response to strong demand for full-color displays, the TFT-type LCD has become the mainstream of development owing to the highest display performance of its kind.  As a result, capital investment by the industry in TFT-type LCDs has grown as large as in the semi-conductor field.<P>
Color filters for TFT-type LCDs are exclusively made through the pigment-contained color photoresist method because such color filters excel other types of color filters in terms of thermal stability, chemical resistance and light stability.<P>
It is anticipated that because of the rapidly expanding demand for TFT-type LCDs, color filters for the TFT-type LCDs will continue to be in short supply for some time to come. <P>
The new joint venture, STI Technology, will play an important role in meeting such market requirements in the years ahead and expects that its annual sales will reach about 20 billion yen in 1997.<P></td></tr>

</td><td>
	In 1910, a Pittsburgh motor car owner walked into chemist Dr. Walter 	Snelling's office, complaining that the gallon of gasoline he had 	purchased was half a gallon by the time he got home.  He thought the 	government should look into why consumers were being cheated because 	the gasoline was evaporating at a rapid and expensive rate.  Dr. 	Snelling took up the challenge and discovered the evaporating gases 	were propane, butane and other hydrocarbons.

	Using coils from an old hot water heater and other miscellaneous 	pieces of laboratory equipment he could find, Dr. Snelling built a 	still that could separate the gasoline into its liquid and gaseous 	components.
 	<P>            
	By 1912, propane gas was cooking food in the home.  The first car 	powered by propane ran in 1913, and by 1915 propane was being used in 	torches to cut through metal.  	Propane was marketed for flame 		cutting and cooking applications by 1920.
	<P>  
	In 1927, the total sales of propane in the U. S. were more than one 	million gallons, and after World War II the propane gas annual sales 	increased to more than 15 billion gallons.
	<P>
	By the 1930s, the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) established and 	proposed a set of recommendations to the National Fire Protection 	Association (NFPA).  In 1932, the first pamphlet of standards (No. 	58) was adopted for publication.
	<P>
	When Dr. Snelling sold his propane patent to Frank Phillips, the 	founder of Phillips Petroleum Company, his price was $50,000.  Today, 	propane gas is an $8 billion industry in the United States alone and 	it is still growing.<P>

	By using propane gas in place of less environmentally friendly fuels, 	you 	can address such pressing issues as acid rain, the "greenhouse effect," 		urban smog, and the thinning ozone layer in a very tangible way.
	<P>
	With propane's simple molecular composition, propane-fueled vehicles emit 	significantly lower levels of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and 		nitrogen oxides than gasoline-fueled vehicles. The level of air 		toxics emissions from propane-fueled vehicles is also low.
	<P>
	Propane also plays a key role in the on-going effort to preserve our 		environment by conserving energy. Most of the electricity in the 		United States is produced by burning coal. However, <B>only 35%</B> of the 	millions of tons of coal burned annually to generate elcetricity is 	converted into electricity. More energy, about another five percent, is 	wasted when electric power is distributued to customers. The bottom line is 	that users of electricity are left <B>holding the bill for the 70%</B> of 	energy resources that <B><I>never</I></B> gets to them.
	<P>
	In addition, burning coal to generate electricity annually releases 	millions of tons of carbon dioxide and other harmful pollutants into 	the atmosphere. Unlike fuel oil, which emits 17% more carbon dioxide 	than gas appliances, propane is clean burning.
	<P>
	If you are deciding about the future with an existing underground 	storage tank (UST), it might be helpful for you to know that because 	propane is non-toxic and does not get into the water table, it is 	exempt from the Department of Environmental Protection (EPA) 		regulations. In fact, the EPA recommends that water suppliers switch 	from petroleum to safer fuels like natural gas or propane. The EPA 	does have stringent regulations on oil and gasoline USTs.
	<P>
	By using propane gas instead of electricity, we can cut these 		emissions in half and help preserve our environment for 		future generations.

Propane Stocks Continue Sharp Decline, Says EIA</a>

		</h2><p>
<!-- Story 1 -->

	U.S. propane stocks fell sharply last week, declining 2.9 MMbbl to around
34.4 MMbbl for the week ending Jan. 24, according to the Energy Information
Administration's (EIA) weekly Propane Watch. Although inventories fell the
most in the Gulf Coast, stocks still remain within their normal range for
this time of year and well ahead of last year.
<p>
	East Coast inventories posted the smallest decline for the week, dropping
0.3 MMbbl to 4.1 MMbbl. East Coast stocks would have to fall an additional
1.7 MMbbl through the remainder of the month to finish at the same level as
January 1996. Midwest stocks fell 0.7 MMbbl to 10.7 MMbbl. Gulf Coast levels
made the sharpest decline, falling 1.9 MMbbl to 18.4 MMbbl. Gulf Coast
stocks would need to fall 2.2 MMbbl over the rest of the month to finish
even with last January.
<p>
	The good news for the industry is that inventories remain healthy compared
to last year. East Coast stocks are within the upper limit of their normal
range and Gulf Coast inventories are at the lowest limit of their normal
range. Midwest stocks are slightly below normal.
<p>
	EIA's propane supply expert, Dave Hinton, told the NEWSLETTER that contrary
to what most people think, propane inventories have fallen dramatically in
January. Over the first two weeks of the month, stocks fell about 5 MMbbl.
According to Hinton, an average draw in January is 8 MMbbl, but if stocks
fall as much during the last half of the month as they did the first half,
inventories will be down about 10 MMbbl and still be within their normal range. 
<p>
December's warmer-than-normal temperatures made it possible for inventories
to recover after a heavy crop drying season and early cold weather. Hinton
says December was about 9.5% warmer than normal across the U.S., and that
overall demand was off.

Pipeline Allocations a Mixed Bag: One Off, One On, One in the Middle

		</h2><p>
<!-- Story 2 -->

The current allocation situation on the three major pipeline systems is one
sign that this winter isn't as severe as last. Of the three, only the Dixie
is on allocation at all terminals. The TEPPCO system has some terminals on
allocation, while MAPCO is not on allocation.
<p>
	The Dixie Pipeline Co.'s (Atlanta) Russ Rauba told the NEWSLETTER the
pipeline started on allocation Nov. 26, 1996, continuing through the new
year until Jan. 3. The system then went back on allocation Jan. 16 and has
remained on ever since. Discussing the Dixie's continuing expansion, Rauba
commented that "with the new pump at the Shilo (Ga.)  station, Dixie is now
able to move approximately 14,000 bbld more propane east of Opelika (Ala.).
However, the capacity out of Hattiesburg will remain 121,000 bbld until the
full expansion is completed this fall."
<p>
	Rick Neal with MAPCO (Tulsa) said the pipeline is not on
allocation-operations have been running smoothly. He reported no problems at
any terminals other than moving snow out of the way. The company has made
sure it maintains the system so that it runs well in cold weather.
<p>
	Texas Eastern Products Pipeline Co. (TEPPCO; Houston) has lifted
allocations from the Coshocton, Ohio, terminal east through the end of the
pipeline. The company's Eric Thode told the NEWSLETTER that allocation at
the Todhunter, Ohio, and Princeton, Ind., terminals has been increased,
allowing customers to pull more product. In response to TEPPCO's changes,
Thode commented there is plenty of product and the weather has been fairly
normal.

NPGA Board To Consider Overfill Prevention Device (OPD) Issues</a>

		</h2><p>
<!-- Story 3 -->
         NPGA's Technology and Standards Committee is expected to ask the
group's board of directors to approve a series of recommendations concerning
the future of overfill protection devices on 4-lb to 70-lb cylinders. Last
June the board approved in principle the devices for small cylinders and
asked the committee to provide detailed comments to fine-tune the concept.
<p>
        The committee is recommending: That the letters "OPD" appear on the
valve body forging and a unique standardized handwheel be used on the valves
for easy identification; That only Type 1, 1-5/16-in. ACME connections and
the CGA 810 connection--not the quick-disconnect Type 2 Hanson connector-be
adopted as the standard connector; That standardized OPDs be adopted by all
manufacturers for use in each size cylinder to assure interchangability and
prevent installation of the wrong size device; That a proposal be made to
the National Conference on Weights and Measures to require the posting at
all cylinder fill stations informing the consumer of the net weight of
filled cylinder contents; That the board support requiring OPDs on cylinders
from four to 40 lb capacity, but exclude larger cylinders (NFPA proposed to
require them on cylinders up to 70 lb), those used in forklift and other
industrial truck applications, and those identified for use for industrial
welding and cutting gases.
<p>
        The committee recommends that all new cylinders in these sizes that
are manufactured after March 1998 be equipped with OPDs. It also suggests
that cylinders requalified after that date but before January 2002 be
retrofitted before being returned to service. Effective Jan. 1, 2002, all
cylinders would be required to have the devices before they could be filled.

Canadian Association Will Adapt, Adopt NPGA Training Program</a>

		</h2><p>
<!-- Story 4 -->
       Utilizing NPGA's Certified Employee Training Program (CETP), the
Propane Gas Association of Canada (PGAC) plans to create its own revised
version that will reflect Canadian standards and regulations. According to
Robert L. Mattocks, chairman of NPGA's Executive Committee, PGAC proposed
that the two organizations share training and safety materials used in their
respective countries. 
<p>
        Details of the agreement between the two organizations are being
finalized; PGAC is expected to create the Canadian version of the materials
and print and distribute them throughout Canada. NPGA will receive an 18%
royalty on all sales in Canada.
<p>
        CETP is a comprehensive program containing basic principles and
practices courses. Other training modules include material specifically
designed to instruct bobtail drivers, bulk plant operators, pipeline
operators, and appliance installers.

Additional Funds Sought for LIHEAP From President</a>

		</h2><p>
<!-- Story 5 -->
	Although this winter has been a mixed bag for the propane industry, what
with the weather proving inconsistent and prices out of this world, it has
been cold enough in many states to draw down funding available for the Low
Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Funding has dipped so low
that about 50 Senators and 148 members of the House of Representatives have
petitioned President Clinton to release extra funds for the program.
<p>
	NPGA's Lisa Bontempo told the NEWSLETTER that NPGA sent a letter to
President Clinton on Dec. 6, 1996, asking him to release emergency funds for
LIHEAP. Ms. Bontempo followed up with a phone call to the White House, but
has yet to hear a response to the association's request. While disappointed
that the President has yet to do anything about additional funding for the
program, she did say that recently there have been rumblings that the White
House is looking into the matter. LIHEAP is given an annual budget to assist
low income households with heating and cooling bills; to supplement the
program, the President can authorize up to $420 million in contingency
funding in case of emergency. 
<p>
	Illinois Propane Gas Association executive director Larry Oneal told the
NEWSLETTER that his state has run out of LIHEAP funds. Illinois used an
additional $1 million of emergency funds to continue the program, but that
money has run out, too. According to Oneal, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun
wrote the President, telling him that as many as 100,000 people will go
without heat if additional funds aren't released for LIHEAP. Oneal commented
that high propane prices have helped pull down LIHEAP faster than normal.
<p>
	Nebraska Propane Gas Association's executive director Jim Spickelmier
reports Nebraska is also running low on LIHEAP funding.

<B>With Colder Temps Driving Crude, Wheres the LP-Gas Market Headed?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>
<I>New York</I>
<P>
Is it cold weather or higher than normal crude prices that are fueling the
international LP-gas market?  The answers from industry pros and consultants
differ but several have told the INTERNATIONAL that both the cold weather in
Europe and crude prices are fairly strong factors influencing todays LP-gas
market.
<P>
Crude prices have remained higher than normal  this winter. As of last
week, crude oil for February delivery hit a contract high of $26.25/bbl on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.   Trading has not been quiet,  though --
there have been as many jumps in price as there have been drops, making for
tumultuous business at best.
<P>
Crude oil futures dropped to $25/bbl (U.S.) on the tenth, while prices
quoted by Dow Jones Energy Service as of Jan. 10 were $22.58 for Arab Lite
and $24.43 for Brent crude.  A year ago, those two crudes were $16.46 and
$17.56, respectively. The market is in need of  a correction, according to
many traders.
<P>
The weather in Europe may be the larger influence providing a base for
North Sea LP-gas prices, commented one trader.  The early January price for
North Sea product was $365-$370/tonne cif and was expected to increase
further later this month. Another industry player said that spot propane in
Amsterdam/Rotterdam/Antwerp has pushed past the $400/tonne level and traders
were seeing spot product as high as $420/tonne cif in that market.  As of
today, the spot price range is $405-$420/tonne.  
<P>
This price level continues to provide an opportunity for North American
exports to be shipped to Western Europe, as Craig Whitley of Purvin &
Gertzs Houston office forecast in December.  While the price  makes exports
possible, a preliminary survey of traders has found no such shipment in the
works, yet.   One trader remarked there hasnt been a deal yet because of
the shortage of vessels.
<P>
Elsewhere, Market Forces Not as Strong.  Some comments regarding market
influences include: Theres been a lot less buying of product this year in
Asia as different countries prepare for their New Year celebrations.  This
appears to be especially true for China, where demand at this time of year
was expected to be much higher.  The price for product is considered to be
the main deterrent. 
<P>
Japanese buyers appear to have backed off from additional purchases (see
related story on p. 4) and there doesnt seem to be any pressing need for
product there. 
<P>
North American demand has been good this year, once winter temperatures set
in.  While some regions of the U.S. and Canada experienced an early winter,
that was not the case everywhere.   In the West, it wasnt cold weather but
rain that created havoc for dealers and wholesalers.  In the region, there
has been a fair amount of demand and a lot of service work; dealers have had
to chase washed out tanks or maneuver damaged roads. 
<P>
Cold temperatures and bad weather have affected the Midwestern regions of
both countries although supplies have not been unduly affected by the
weather.  Prices have been slowly coming off their December highs, when
Conway, Kan., and Mont Belvieu averages topped a $1/gal., levels not seen
since the winter of 1989.
<P>
The consultants at Purvin & Gertz told the INTERNATIONAL that market
sentiment in North America is that the industry has made it through the
worst part and prices have probably peaked. While bad weather has again
settled in across the Midwest and Eastern states, prices on a whole were not
moving up this week.  Some producers and wholesalers were increasing prices,
but they were not in the majority. 
<P>
A similar comment was given by Poten & Partners (New York) Rudy Clark.  He
noted that while many in the industry worldwide believe prices have peaked,
it seems that they are still cruising upward.  Hopefully, the weather will
ease off, which may change the psychology of the market.

<B>World Bank Recommends Azerbaijan Sell LP-Gas Firm</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>
<I>Washington, D.C.</I>
<P>
A recent investment decision by the World Bank  not to provide funds for
Azerbaijans state energy monopoly as it is now structured, with both
natural gas and LP-gas service, but rather to target its funds and
consulting work in the natural gas area would appear to be a slap in the
face to the LP-gas industry.  Not so, said one of the agencys energy
economists.  The decision that gave funds to improve and rehabilitate some
of the countrys natural gas infrastructure was based on the agencys
opinion that it would be much harder to attract foreign investment in the
natural gas sector there than in the LP-gas system.   Basically, the energy
economist told the INTERNATIONAL, the LP-gas business is a much more
attractive business in countries such as Azerbaijan.
<P>
Change is fraught with peril.  A prime example of this statement is the
former Soviet Union.   As the communist government collapsed, so did the
government entities that provided services to its citizens. Especially hard
hit since the FSU began splitting up are the smaller republics, such as
Azerbaijan.  Without funds from Moscow to keep its unwieldy bureaucracies
operating, utilities have been floundering, needing funds to purchase fuel
and for equipment. 
<P>
International aid agencies, such as the World Bank, have been stepping into
this void trying to provide economic assistance in the form of consulting
services and actual funds.  The World Bank in particular puts a lot of time
into researching the current situation as well as the expectations for the
country before presenting its aid package to the government. 
<P>
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) began to work with
the Azerbaijan government in 1995, at about the same time the country was
undergoing a gradual stabilization.  After several years of political
problems within the country as well as between it and its neighbors,
including the collapse of trade due to regional problems and a three-year
war with Armenia, Azerbaijan appears to have emerged from its post-FSU
period ready for more change.
<P>
A World Bank spokeswoman told the INTERNATIONAL that since the countrys
internal and external political situation has stabilized enough to again
encourage foreign investment in its oil industry, its government has been
working on development strategy to maintain and build its infrastructure,
especially its oil and gas industries.  Azerbaijan joined the World Bank and
the International Development Association (IDA) in 1992 to work on programs
to support the countrys policies. A World Bank key objective has been to
strengthen the governments resources to manage petroleum resources.  Money
has been made available to create a framework to encourage investment in
this sector.  Between the World Bank and other international agencies, all
aspects of the countrys energy sector have been studied to find the best
areas to provide support and assistance.  
<P>
With natural gas and crude an important part of the economy, the World
Banks financial investigation has centered on this industry.  Its
researchers have been  looking at the best ways to maximize funds that could
be provided through the World Bank and other institutions.  A preliminary
request for investors, consultants, and other interested parties last fall
described a potential program that would have rehabilitated the gas
infrastructure, including the LP-gas industry.  
<P>
However, according to Peggy Wilson, an energy economist working on the
project, the final proposal will focus on the natural gas sector.   She
called the decision a simple matter of investment priorities.  The LP-gas
business now run by the state energy company can stand by itself and is much
more attractive, currently, to foreign investors than is the natural gas
industry, especially in a country such as Azerbaijan.
<P>
By selling off the LP-gas business, it will be easier for Azerbaijan to
concentrate on its natural gas business, which has a much larger
infrastructure although it is in need of a bigger chunk of investment funds.
The World Bank is arranging for approximately $65 million (U.S.) in
investment credit, with the money earmarked for the natural gas
infrastructure.  According to Ms. Wilson, the Azerbaijan government
reportedly plans to privatize its LP-gas business as a result of the World
Banks research and recommendations.  With so much money needed to update
the two businesses, Wilson commented that focusing on the natural gas unit
was a matter of investment priorities; at the same time, selling off the
LP-gas unit reduces the monetary burden updating it would have on the
government.

<B>New Ruling Allows Japanese Importers Some Leeway on Storage</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>
<I>Tokyo</I>
<P>
In past winters, it has been very aggravating for Japanese LPG importers to
comply with a mandated stockpile requirement, especially when product prices
have been high.  This winter, in particular, it has been very expensive to
comply with the rule, but the governments energy department has eased the
rule somewhat.
<P>
Importing product to maintain the 50-days- worth level also provides
support for the higher price levels, one importer said, furthering a bullish
tone in the spot market when importers have to purchase spot cargoes to meet
the requirement.  Under the ruling from the Natural Resources & Energy
Agency, importers can now borrow product from other importers.
<P>
According to the federal agency, the relaxed requirements on mandatory LPG
stockpiles are partially in response to the soaring international LPG
prices.  The change allows importers who need to replenish stocks to
temporarily claim fuel owned by other importers with product to spare.  The
borrowing is expected to take place only on paper without physical movement.
Once the importers product has arrived title to the borrowed product
reverts to its original owner.

	In 1910, a Pittsburgh motor car owner walked into chemist Dr. Walter 	Snelling's office, complaining that the gallon of gasoline he had 	purchased was half a gallon by the time he got home.  He thought the 	government should look into why consumers were being cheated because 	the gasoline was evaporating at a rapid and expensive rate.  Dr. 	Snelling took up the challenge and discovered the evaporating gases 	were propane, butane and other hydrocarbons.
	<P> 
	Using coils from an old hot water heater and other miscellaneous 	pieces of laboratory equipment he could find, Dr. Snelling built a 	still that could separate the gasoline into its liquid and gaseous 	components.
 	<P>            
	By 1912, propane gas was cooking food in the home.  The first car 	powered by propane ran in 1913, and by 1915 propane was being used in 	torches to cut through metal.  	Propane was marketed for flame 		cutting and cooking applications by 1920.
	<P>  
	In 1927, the total sales of propane in the U. S. were more than one 	million gallons, and after World War II the propane gas annual sales 	increased to more than 15 billion gallons.
	<P>
	By the 1930s, the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) established and 	proposed a set of recommendations to the National Fire Protection 	Association (NFPA).  In 1932, the first pamphlet of standards (No. 	58) was adopted for publication.
	<P>
	When Dr. Snelling sold his propane patent to Frank Phillips, the 	founder of Phillips Petroleum Company, his price was $50,000.  Today, 	propane gas is an $8 billion industry in the United States alone and 	it is still growing.<P>

Combining hands-on activities with written evaluation, employer vesication of job skills, and third-party certification, CETP will raise the level of your employees' technical competence.  It's based on prevailing industry practices and national standards <i>(NFPA 54 and 58)</i> and is adaptable for use in a variety of settings; from in-house training and self study to community college or trade school courses.  Since its implementation in 1989, CETP has become <b>the training standard of the propane gas industry.</B></td><td align=right><img src="/npga/images/cetpseal.gif"></td></tr></table>

<img src="/npga/images/ssd.gif">
<p>
Through its Technology and Standards Committee, NPGA has direct input into the development of safety standards and model codes that regulate the propane gas industry.  The committee meets twice a year to discuss and submit proposals to <b>NFPA 54,</b> <i>The National Fuel Gas Code,</i> and <b>NFPA 58,</b><i> Standard for the Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases.</i>  The committee also addresses and monitors model building and construction codes, as well as ANSI, ASTM, and UL standards.

The GAS Check Progam is an on-going safety inspection of residential propane systems.  A GAS Check inspection typically takes 90 minutes and involves pressure checking the entire system, inspecting all system components - from tank to the burner tip - familiarizing customers with propane's odor, and advising them of safe, efficient ways to operate their propane appliances.  To help you accomplish these tasks, GAS Check provides training videos, consumer education and promotional materials, and an inspection checklist.  GAS Check has received national safety awards and has been applauded by the Consumer Product Safety Commission staff.  Insurance companies have even granted premium discounts to GAS Check participants because of its role in reducing accidents. (GAS Check &#169; is a registered trademark of NPGA.)</td><td align=right><img src="/npga/images/gascheck.gif"></td></tr></table>

	By using propane gas in place of less environmentally friendly fuels, 	you 	can address such pressing issues as acid rain, the "greenhouse effect," 		urban smog, and the thinning ozone layer in a very tangible way.
	<P>
	With propane's simple molecular composition, propane-fueled vehicles emit 	significantly lower levels of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and 		nitrogen oxides than gasoline-fueled vehicles. The level of air 		toxics emissions from propane-fueled vehicles is also low.
	<P>
	Propane also plays a key role in the on-going effort to preserve our 		environment by conserving energy. Most of the electricity in the 		United States is produced by burning coal. However, <B>only 35%</B> of the 	millions of tons of coal burned annually to generate elcetricity is 	converted into electricity. More energy, about another five percent, is 	wasted when electric power is distributued to customers. The bottom line is 	that users of electricity are left <B>holding the bill for the 70%</B> of 	energy resources that <B><I>never</I></B> gets to them.
	<P>
	In addition, burning coal to generate electricity annually releases 	millions of tons of carbon dioxide and other harmful pollutants into 	the atmosphere. Unlike fuel oil, which emits 17% more carbon dioxide 	than gas appliances, propane is clean burning.
	<P>
	If you are deciding about the future with an existing underground 	storage tank (UST), it might be helpful for you to know that because 	propane is non-toxic and does not get into the water table, it is 	exempt from the Department of Environmental Protection (EPA) 		regulations. In fact, the EPA recommends that water suppliers switch 	from petroleum to safer fuels like natural gas or propane. The EPA 	does have stringent regulations on oil and gasoline USTs.
	<P>
	By using propane gas instead of electricity, we can cut these 		emissions in half and help preserve our environment for 		future generations.

	Propane, or liquefied petroleum gas (LP-gas), is one of the nation's most versatile sources of energy and supplies 3 to 4 percent of our total energy. Propane is an approved, alternative clean fuel listed in the 1990 Clean Air Act as well as the National Energy Policy Act of 1992.
<p>
Propane can be either a liquid or a gas. At normal atmospheric pressure and temperature, it is a non-toxic, colorless and odorless gas. Just like natural gas, an identifying odor is added so it can be readily detected. Under moderate pressure, propane becomes a liquid that vaporizes into a clean-burning gas when released from its storage container. Propane is 270 times more compact as a liquid than a gas, making it economical to store and transport as a liquid.
<p>
As opposed to relying on foreign sources, approximately 90 percent of the United States propane supply is produced domestically. Seventy percent of the remaining supply is imported from Canada and Mexico. Natural gas production accounts for 53 percent of our domestic propane supply, while 47 percent is produced from the refining of crude oil.
	<P>
Propane is called a fossil fuel because it is composed of the remains of plants and animals that inhabited the Earth millions of years ago.

People use propane for heating and cooling homes, heating water, 	
cooking, refrigeration, drying clothes, barbecuing, lighting, and 	
relaxing in front of the gas fireplace.
<P>
More and more homes, even those found in the affluent outskirts of
metropolitan areas, are being built to use propane--supplied discreetly,
almost invisibly, from the underground tanks.   And where soil conditions
or terrain make buried tanks impractical above ground tanks are
incorporated directly into the siting plans.

Home buyers prefer gas energy because it is clean, reliable and far more
economical than electricity.  And where natural gas lines don't go, 
propane
does.  So all the benefits of gas really are available wherever the home
buyer wants them, wherever new homes are built.  That's why the number of
homes using propane--already nearly 8 million strong--is growing every 
day!

	Commercial establishments such as hotels, motels and restaurants use 	propane	in the same way a homeowner does: for heating and cooling 	air, heating water, cooking, refrigeration, drying clothes, 		barbecuing and lighting.  Industrial sites rely on it for space 	heating, brazing, soldering, cutting, heat treating, annealing, 	vulcanizing and many other uses.  Petrochemical industries 		use propane as a feedstock to make such products as plastic bags.

	By a four-to-one margin, the safest way to provide heat is with gas. 
That's what the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) concluded in its 
study, <I><B>U.S. Home Heating Fire Patterns and Trends</B></I>. 
In analyzing the comparative risks of home heating devices, the NFPA concluded 
that the odds of a fire in your home are greater with fuel oil-powered heating 
units than with furnaces burning gas. In addition, there are many new
devices on today's propane gas appliances and equipment that have proven to enhance 
safety and efficiency.
	
<P>
	Propane has an enviable safety record due in large part to the 
stringent codes and regulations developed by the propane industry in conjunction with
 the NFPA. Every aspect of installation, storage and tank filling is addressed to assure
 that each new propane installation will provide a lifetime of worry-free operation. 
In addition, we conduct regular, thorough training for our service and 	delivery staff 
to assure proper handling of propane and propane equipment.
<P>
	Propane gas is non-toxic, so it's not harmful to soil and water. 	
Since it does not endanger the environment, the storage of propane tanks either 
above or below ground is not regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA). Fuel oil and gasoline, however, are extremely toxic, and the EPA does impose strict
regulations on the storage of these fuels.
	The propane industry has always focused on strong safety and 
educational programs among its personnel. Within the last several years, two programs
have been initiated by the industry to further enhance this philosophy.

<td>
	The GAS Check&#174; and CETP programs serve as ample evidence of the 	
industry's commitment to insure that propane continues to be a safe and efficient
energy alternative for America.
<P>
	The Gas Appliance System Check (or GAS Check&#174;) Program is 
designed to reduce the possibility of residential accidents by periodically
 inspecting the entire residential propane system for safety and efficiency, and by 
educating the consumer as to safe practices with propane installations. The majority 
of the nation's propane retailers voluntarily participate in this program, which 
celebrated its 10th anniversary during 1995. Each retailer involved in the 
program receives special training on how to inspect propane appliances, storage 
tanks, and piping for safety and efficiency.
<P>
	Over two million such inspections have been conducted to date, and 
GAS Check&#174; has been recognized by the Consumer Product Safety Commission 
and the National Fire Protection Association as a positive program to prevent 
propane related accidents.

	Training of industry personnel who handle propane has been performed as long as 
the industry has been in existence. Recently, however, the National Propane Gas Association 
has drawn from many of these training procedure to develop a uniform, nationally 
recognized training program for the various tasks involved in handling propane 
and its equipment and appliances. This Certified Employee Training Program (CETP) 
is being used extensively throughout the country, while the program continues to expand 
and be updated.

The Propane Vehicle Council was established in early 1994 to advance propane's future as a clean, safe and superior performing alternative transportation fuel.
<P>
The Council brings together and leads industry efforts to develop a strong U.S. market for propane.  Through aggressive lobbying and public relations efforts, it works to remove legislative and regulatory barriers and increases awareness of propane's advantages as a transportation fuel among government officials, the auto industry and consumers.  It also undertakes projects to encourage the development, demonstration and marketing of propane-related technologies and propane-powered vehicles.
<P>
Working together with the National Propane Gas Association, the Council is composed of a wide variety of stakeholders with a significant interest in the transportation fuel market for propane.
<P>
Membership is open to any individual, company or association which supports the purposes of the Council.  Membership categories include propane marketers, propane producers and pipeline operators, equipment manufacturers and distributors, vehicle and engine manufacturers and associates.
<P>

<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=+2 color="#ffffff">T</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 color="#ffffff">he Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) surveyed 20 lb. propane cylinders in January, 1995 and found "an excessive number of short weight cylinders" for sale at exchange racks.<br><p>
Given the problems of determining the exact tare weight and the safety considerations of overfilling, the WPGA encourages dealers not to fill a cylinder with less than the stated amount and not to overfill.  Consequently, filling the cylinder with 18 pounds of propane and properly labeling the cylinder may be the best approach, though the DATCP also spells out recommended procedures for determining an individual cylinder's exact tare weight.<br><p>
For convenience, the WPGA has produced a label and offers it for sale.  It complies with the DATCP policy on filling propane cylinders.  In particular, the DATCP has said, "If cylinders are being filled to less than capacity, the quantity must be legibly marked on the cylinder or a tag attached to the cylinder."<br><p>
The label is printed on heavy coated material to withstand the weather and has a self-adhesive backing so that it can be permanently affixed to a cylinder.<br><p>
In addition to the label, the DATCP requires that "declaration of quantity, price and a statement of responsibility must either be posted at the location of sale, or exchange, or indicated on the individual cylinders.

<blockquote>
For years, New England families and businesses living on the gas main have
counted on clean, dependable natural gas for heating, water heating,
cooking, and clothes drying.
<P>
Even if you're located in an area where natural gas service is not
available, you can still enjoy the benefits of gas with propane--also known
as "bottled gas."
<P>
Propane offers the same environmental and economical advantages as natural
gas.  It is gentle on the environment because when propane is burned, the
emissions meet the standards for clean air set by the EPA.  And propane gas
prices now average more than 50% lower than electricity prices nationwide.
<P>
Currently serving thousands of customers in your area, Bay State and
Northern Propane have the resources to meet all your propane needs.
