<blockquote>

<font size=4> Most famous for allegedly uttering the words, "Dr.  
Livingstone, I presume," Henry Morton Stanley was one of the most 
<img src="Stanley.gif" width=200 height=334 border=1 vspace=5 hspace=15 
align=left>
well-known of all nineteenth-century British explorers.  In his early years 
(as a naturalized American) he led a roving life, fighting in the American 
Civil War, serving in the merchant marine and the federal navy, and 
reporting as a journalist on the early days of frontier expansion.  He 
became famous when the <i>New York Herald</i> commissioned him to "find 
Livingstone" in Africa.<p>

After finding Robert Livingstone (no mean feat, since Livingstone was living 
in the 
interior of Zanzibar, where even his friends could not find him), and following in the footsteps of Livingstone, 
Richard Burton, John Hanning Speke, and others, Stanley went on to explore the rivers and lakes 
of central Africa.  <i>Through the Dark Continent</i> (1877) is his account of 
those explorations.  Failing to interest the British government in 
developing the Congo, Stanley accepted the invitation of King Leopold of 
Belgium to explore the region -- an expedition that led to the 
establishment of the "Congo Free State" under the sovereignty of King 
Leopold, and to Stanley's book, <i>The Founding of the Congo Free 
State</i> (1885).  Stanley continued to explore and write until the end of the 
century, producing <i>In Darkest Africa</i> in 1890 and <i>Through South 
Africa</i> in 1898.  He died in England in 1904.<p>

	<font size=5>"F</font>inally, I decided to take the plunge," Henry Chauncey wrote in his diary on

Sunday, February 4, 1945, a few days before his fortieth birthday, and so a

natural day for assessing the course of his life. "From a safe and respected

job I am embarking on an opportunity whose development depends very much on

what I do." The safe and respected job was an assistant deanship at Harvard,

where he had been working as an administrator for fifteen years; the

opportunity was a position in the nascent field of educational testing, where

Chauncey would be in on the founding of an organization that could, he thought,

in effect serve as the personnel office of the postwar United States, using

multiple-choice mental tests to assess large segments of the civilian

population for the first time in the country's history.<p>



<p>



Chauncey, descended from clergymen (his father was an Episcopalian minister,

his ancestors Puritans), went to church, and afterward he added to the day's

diary entry: <p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

During Church this morning a thought occurred to me which though not new was

amplified in its implications. . . . As soon as we can put in numerical terms

the needs for individuals in different types of employment, nationally and

locally, we will be able to embark through appropriate tests on a census of the

population in relation to those jobs. . . . Since we do not want to prescribe

what a person should do we can indicate to the boy or girl the probability of

success or failure in each field of work and the demand for people of his

combination of abilities. . . . This project requires consideration from a lot

of angles but men of vision in the field of testing, vocational guidance,

government, economics, education could be consulted individually and eventually

in groups and a program eventually developed. Men with whom this might be

discussed might even be so high in authority as . . . President Roosevelt

himself.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



With this dream in mind Henry Chauncey accepted the job, which metamorphosed

into the first presidency of the Educational Testing Service--today one of the

most familiar but least public of major American institutions, whose origins

and rise to influence have never before been described in detail. ETS and its

tests are a national obsession, deeply worked into the fabric of middle-class

life. They have generated a large, independent test-prep industry and have

strongly influenced elementary and secondary education, one of whose central

goals is preparation for ETS tests. They are constantly referred to in cultural

commentary, in sources from <I>Boyz N the Hood</I> to <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>. ETS is

more than just an important organization. It is an essential part of a larger

nexus: American higher education, whose growth to a scale and significance

previously unimagined anywhere in the world was one of the crucial developments

in our society during the past half century; and, more broadly, what the

eminent sociologist Robert K. Merton calls the structure of opportunity--a

subject that ranks with its close relative, race relations, at the top of the

list of the defining concerns of America.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>STATUS QUO ANTE</font></b><p>



<p>



<font size=5>H</font>ENRY Chauncey became interested in mental testing the moment he heard about

it. His mind, like the minds of his Puritan forebears, was attracted to a blend

of purity, order, idealism, and grandeur, which testing seemed to embody.

During his first year of college, which he spent at Ohio State tuition-free,

because his father was the rector of a big church in Columbus, he was given a

multiple-choice placement test (on which, as would be the case whenever he took

a test, he scored well but not outstandingly), and he also took a course on

testing. At Harvard, alma mater of Chaunceys since the 1600s, where Henry

enrolled after the year in Columbus, he studied testing under another pioneer

in the field, Philip Rulon. The distinguishing feature of Chauncey's

undergraduate career, however, was that he was a star athlete. A towering,

moon-faced, big-jawed paragon of self-confidence, Chauncey was a good enough

baseball player to be recruited by the Boston Braves, and in football he made

what one of his classmates later called "that greatest of all forward passes,

and also the most aristocratic," to his friend William Saltonstall, for a

touchdown in the 1926 Harvard-Yale game.<p>



<p>



Among the crowd in the Yale Bowl that day was Richard Gummere, the headmaster

of the William Penn Charter School, in Philadelphia, who, as Chauncey half

jokingly put it later, was so impressed by the touchdown pass that he offered

Chauncey a job as a teacher. In 1929, after two years at Penn Charter, Chauncey

returned to Harvard as an assistant dean, with the eventual goal of starting

his own boarding school. But his interests soon took him elsewhere. <p>



<p>



In January of 1932 Chauncey attended a lecture at Harvard by William S.

Learned, a social scientist (at that time a somewhat exotic new breed) on the

staff of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Learned

described an ambitious study (studies were exotic then too) that the Carnegie

Foundation had been conducting for nearly five years in Pennsylvania, in which

standardized achievement tests were administered to tens of thousands of high

school and college students.<p>



<p>



Shockingly, the researchers found, the relationship between the students' test

scores and their level of education was quite weak. Many high school students

outscored college students, and more than half of those high school students

who did not go on to college tested at a higher level than a quarter of college

juniors. In 1932 it was miraculous that students' educational achievement could

be scientifically measured across a broad range of schools in this way, instead

of being judged merely on the basis of course hours taken and degrees attained.

The study seemed to hold the promise that after century upon unchanged century

a new, rationalized era in education might dawn.<p>



<p>



Aflame, the twenty-six-year-old Chauncey fired off a lengthy letter to William

Learned. "In the first place, and fundamentally most important, I am interested

in the complete reorientation and reorganization of secondary school aims and

methods," he wrote. He had another idea for the short run: "Though [the idea]

is of less fundamental importance, I believe it is of more immediate

consequence. It is less complicated and more possible of fruition in the near

future. It is concerned with the application of objective tests to college

admission." Chauncey offered to help in establishing such tests at Harvard,

which was a smaller field than he had in mind but the only one he could then

play on. At the start of his career he had found a newborn cause to which he

was willing to devote his life.<p>



<p>



In the spring of the following year came another fortunate development for

Chauncey: James Bryant Conant was appointed president of Harvard. Conant, a

thin, severe, bespectacled chemist, was the first Harvard president from a

humble background, and he immediately moved to increase the representation of

younger versions of himself (as opposed to younger versions of the

boarding-school-educated Chauncey, who predominated) in the Harvard

undergraduate student body. Only a few weeks after taking office, Conant called

in a group of deans including Chauncey and said he wanted to create an

ambitious new scholarship program. Harvard had scholarships already, but they

were either informal arrangements (Chauncey's own Harvard education had been

paid for mainly by Clarence Dillon, a prominent Wall Street financier) or what

Conant called "badges of poverty": you had to be poor to qualify, the grant was

so small that you had to work to supplement it, and you were cut off if you

didn't maintain a higher grade-point average than that of other scholarship

candidates.<p>



<p>



What Conant had in mind was full, four-year, nearly unconditional scholarships

to be awarded solely on the basis of academic promise: if a rich boy won, he

would be designated a Harvard National Scholar but would receive only a token

grant. Another of Conant's motives was a desire to make Harvard a more national

and less provincially northeastern institution. The Harvard National

Scholarships were initially limited to students from six states in the upper

Midwest, which in 1933 was still uncharted territory as far as elite higher

education was concerned. <p>



<p>



Henry Chauncey's job was to figure out a way to select the scholarship

students. During the Depression college student bodies were substantially

self-selected, mainly on the basis of ability to pay. It was assumed that most

of the students at a place like Harvard had gone to well-known and trusted

private schools, where a decent record was a reliable indicator of the ability

to do college work. There were many years in which virtually the entire

graduating class of Groton, Chauncey's boarding school, went to Harvard or

Yale.<p>



<p>



In 1900 the presidents of twelve leading northeastern universities had set up

an organization called the College Entrance Examination Board, which

administered admissions tests. These were lengthy essay examinations in

specific subjects, which students took over a period of days and which were

then shipped to the College Board office in New York and laboriously

hand-graded by professional readers. The purpose for which the College Board

had been invented was not really selection, which was almost a non-issue. It

was to standardize the admissions process administratively and to force New

England boarding schools to adopt a uniform curriculum--they would have to fill

their students with the information required to pass the exams--so that

undergraduates would arrive well prepared.<p>



<p>



The College Boards were of little use to Henry Chauncey's new project. They

weren't administered until June (too late to select students for scholarships),

weren't administered at all in most of the Midwest, and most boys who hadn't

studied the boarding-school curriculum couldn't pass them anyway. What Chauncey

needed was a uniform means of comparing students from all across the highly

localized American education system--an academic equivalent of the standard

gauge that the railroad industry had adopted after the Civil War. The United

States had already become a national society in most ways, having generated, in

addition to the standard gauge, a bureaucratized federal government, big

corporations, and national communications media. But education--an enormous

field with importance beyond its size, because of its role as a handler of

people--remained a local matter.<p>



<p>



Along with Wilbur J. Bender, a solid, plainspoken Hoosier who was also an

assistant dean, Chauncey hit the road, aiming to find objective tests that

could be used in the new scholarship program. It was Chauncey's fascination

with testing that had gotten him the assignment in the first place; educational

testing was still new enough that Chauncey and Bender could get to know most of

its progenitors personally. Psychology as a discipline had emerged only a few

decades previously; intelligence tests dated from just around the time Henry

Chauncey was born. The first (in fact, at that point the only) mass

administration of objective mental tests--the Alpha and Beta tests, versions of

the IQ test that were used to select officer candidates from the pool of Army

recruits--had occurred just fifteen years earlier, during the First World War,

under primitive testing conditions. The two key figures Chauncey and Bender

encountered, Ben D. Wood and Carl C. Brigham, had both helped to administer the

Alpha and Beta and had been proteges of leading first-generation intelligence

testers.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>EARLY TESTERS</font></b><p>



<p>



<font size=5>"I</font>N all too many of the social science fields there is a large proportion of

the slightly maladjusted," Chauncey once wrote in his diary. He might have had

both Ben Wood and Carl Brigham in mind. Wood, the eleventh of thirteen

children, was raised on the Texas-Mexico border, where his parents had moved in

the hope of improving his mother's failing health. He spent the first six

months of his life in, he later wrote, a "marsupial sanctuary inside my

mother's clothing," and his early childhood living in a supposedly

disease-proof elevated, tented six-by-six-foot crib set outside. He was tended

to by a young Mexican girl who spoke no English. Another babysitter once

mistakenly gave him kerosene to drink, with the result that he was not able to

speak normally until adulthood. In addition, he was subjected to regular

beatings by his father and his brothers.<p>



<p>



Shy, brainy, eccentric, and opinionated, the adult Wood believed that testing

would purge the education system of what he saw as its pervasive idiocy, which

he had first encountered when the University of Texas required him to take

elementary Spanish even though his first spoken language was Spanish. After

Texas he went to Columbia University, where he fell under the spell of Edward

L. Thorndike, who in 1919 had created a multiple-choice admissions exam, based

on the Army Alpha, for Columbia students. Wood became an indefatigable promoter

of standardized testing. During the 1920s he administered the first objective

section of the New York State Regents exam; he became William Learned's partner

in conducting the Carnegie Foundation study of education in Pennsylvania; he

founded the Cooperative Test Service, which sold tests to schools; and he began

working with Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, to develop a machine that could

score thousands or even millions of tests in the mass administrations that were

sure to come. (In 1935 Wood also created the Graduate Record Examinations for

the Carnegie Foundation, and in 1939 he started the National Teacher

Examinations.)<p>



<p>



What so annoyed Wood about education was that it was illogical and

disorganized. There was no real system for preparing students for college. The

colleges themselves were run for the benefit of the professors, who taught

whatever they wanted and declared students educated merely because they had

spent a certain number of hours in class. Even so, most students who entered

didn't graduate--they either quit or flunked out--and the worst of the college

students who did finish usually went on to become schoolteachers. (Despite the

fulfillment of most of Wood's dreams about the institution of mass testing,

much of this is still true:only half of the students who enroll full-time in

four-year colleges go on to earn bachelor's degrees, and students at teachers

colleges perennially have lower test scores than students at liberal-arts

colleges.) Wood dreamed of establishing what he called "self-education," in

which students would move through the education system on the basis of their

own objectively demonstrated achievement, without reference to such foolishness

as credit hours and semesters. He was not a democratizer, though. At a time

when six or seven percent of eighteen-to-twenty-four-year-olds were enrolled in

institutions of higher learning (today 30 percent are), Wood believed that a

third of the college population didn't belong there. New people--talented and

obscure, as he had been--should be brought in, but not necessarily in numbers

that would expand the overall size of the college population.<p>



<p>



Carl Brigham, Ben Wood's opposite in many ways and eventually his enemy, had

been born into the northeastern gentry and had drunk his way through his first

two years at Princeton while Wood was studying the classics at the University

of Texas; his friends were almost shocked when Brigham got interested in mental

testing and became scholarly. During the First World War, Brigham worked at the

side of Robert Yerkes, the psychologist who had sold the Army on the idea of

the Alpha and Beta tests. After the war he became a psychology professor at

Princeton (where in later years he would be Albert Einstein's next-door

neighbor) and also, like many psychometricians of the day, an enthusiastic

member of the eugenics movement. Brigham fully accepted the prevailing division

of the population of Europe into three races--Nordic, Alpine, and

Mediterranean--and shared the eugenicists' alarm over the predominance of the

supposedly inferior latter two of these in the American immigrant population.

In 1923 Brigham published a book called <I>A Study of American Intelligence</I>,

introduced by Yerkes, which analyzed the Alpha and Beta results by race and

came to the grim conclusion--based, Brigham insisted, on a dispassionate

scientific examination of the evidence and not on prejudice--that "American

intelligence is declining, and will proceed with an accelerating rate as the

racial admixture becomes more and more extensive."<p>



<p>



During the 1920s Brigham developed his own objective admissions test for

students applying to Princeton. The College Board then put him in charge of a

committee to develop a test that could be used by a wider group of schools.

Brigham called this test, which was clearly modeled on the Army Alpha, the

Scholastic Aptitude Test. On June 23, 1926, the SATwas experimentally

administered for the first time, to 8,000 high school students, but it was not

used by colleges to help sift applicants. Unlike Ben Wood, Brigham --a nattily

dressed, companionable Ivy Leaguer--had a natural rapport with the College

Board. Because of Brigham's presence there, the Board opened a small branch

office in Princeton, where he would conduct research on objective testing in

its behalf.<p>



<p>



By the time Henry Chauncey and Wilbur Bender met him, in December of 1933, 

Brigham had distanced himself from--in fact, had publicly renounced--most 

of what he had written ten years earlier in <I>A Study of American 

Intelligence</I>.  He felt that he had then been writing more as a promoter 

of IQ testing than as a disinterested scientist, and he now doubted the 

whole idea that there is an all-important human intelligence quotient.  As 

early as 1927 Brigham wrote Lewis Terman, the father of IQ testing in 

America, "It seems to me that the time was not ripe for the publication of 

such a book," because the data were not solid enough.  In 1929 he wrote 

Charles Davenport, a leading eugenicist, "The more I work in this field, 

the more I am convinced that psychologists have sinned greatly in sliding 

easily from the name of the test to the function or trait measured.  Tests 

have encouraged an enormous series of hypostatized 'traits.'" During the 

early 1930s Brigham several times repudiated his earlier views in speeches 

and in print (notably in a book called, in pointed contrast to his first 

title, <I>A Study of Error</I>).  He wrote that <I>A Study of American 

Intelligence</I> was "without foundation" and that IQ was "one of the most 

glorious fallacies in the history of science."<p>



<p>



Because Brigham left behind very few personal papers, the question of what

exactly caused his views to change is difficult to answer. Eugenics was passing

out of fashion at the time. In <I>A Study of American Intelligence</I> the logical

flaw that leaps out is that IQ scores, which supposedly measure an innate

quality, rise steadily for immigrants according to how long they have lived in

the United States. Given the importance of vocabulary items on the test, surely

language acquisition at least partly explains this. Yet in the book Brigham put

forth the theory that every year's crop of immigrants was just a little less

bright than the previous year's. The extent to which the SAT embodied Brigham's

views from A Study of American Intelligence days is unknown. On the first SAT

there were sections devoted to such vocabulary items as antonyms and analogies,

as there had been on IQ and Army Alpha tests. Brigham's statistician, Cecil

Brolyer, told an interviewer much later that despite the test's name, "we

weren't thinking in terms of aptitude" for what the SAT would measure. Rather,

they were thinking of educational preparedness.<p>



<p>



Brigham hardly became a liberal, though. In 1930, well into his change of

heart, he wrote his mentor, Yerkes, that the old Nordic supremacist Charles

Gould "grows more delightful and witty as years go by." At around the same

time, in a note to Harold Dodds, the president of Princeton, about candidates

for a professorship in anthropology, he wrote, "Best man: Melville H.

Hershkovitz. Jew. . . . Next best: Lloyd Warner, Harvard. . . . The white

hope." Is the note evidence of prejudice on Brigham's part (in <I>A Study of

American Intelligence</I> he had written, "Our figures . . . would rather tend to

disprove the popular belief that the Jew is highly intelligent"), or is it an

attempt to induce Dodds to overrule what would be the obvious choice in the

anti-Semitic academia of the 1920s? It's impossible to say.<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=4><b>THE SAT SPREADS</font></b><p>



<p>



<font size=5>C</font>HAUNCEY and Bender decided to use the SAT as their main test for the Harvard

National Scholarship program. (Bender would in the 1950s become the head of

admissions at Harvard, in which position he made the student body more

national.) Harvard was a leading member of the College Board, and not only was

Brigham in effect the board's house psychometrician but also the SAT was a

useful test. The key issues for a mental test are reliability, or the stability

of a person's score over several administrations of the same test, and

validity, or its ability to predict. The SAT was highly reliable and, in the

necessarily tiny early studies comparing scores with first-year grades in

college, seemed to be valid, too.<p>



<p>



Another advantage of the SAT, or any other multiple-choice test, was that it

was easy to give to very large numbers of people at a time--an idea that

appealed considerably to Chauncey, for whom the job at hand was picking a few

Harvard National Scholars but who had dreams of testing on a much broader

scale. Tests that required the tester to question the taker directly could be

administered only in limited quantities; although essay tests could be

administered to large groups, they had to be graded by experts, who were

expensive and slow. The SAT was hand-scored, but by clerks who worked quickly.

And the automatic scoring of tests by machine--a project that had been stalled

in the laboratories of IBM for years--had recently become a real possibility.<p>



<p>



In 1931 Reynold B. Johnson, a young high school science teacher in the town of

Ironwood, Michigan, began experimenting with an electrical test scorer. He got

a prototype working, barely, and the local newspaper did a story about him that

was picked up by the Associated Press and that attracted attention from all

over the country. Johnson gave the machine a name, the Markograph, and had an

advertisement made up showing it being caressed by a pretty girl.<p>



<p>



While exhibiting the Markograph at a National Education Association convention

in Minneapolis, Johnson was struck by a flash of inspiration. As a farm boy in

Minnesota, he had tormented his older sisters' dates by scratching pencil marks

on the outside of the spark plugs on their Model-T Fords: because graphite

conducts electricity, when they tried to start their cars, the pencil marks

would draw the sparks away from the spark plugs, so the engine couldn't ignite,

ha ha. Why not use the same principle in a test-scoring machine? If students

marked their answers in pencil on a separate sheet, then a machine could

electrically sense whether the answers were in the right spaces.<p>



<p>



Johnson went right to work on a new machine that could detect pencil marks; by

the end of the summer of 1933 he had a working model. Meanwhile, because of the

Depression, he was laid off by the school in Ironwood. Engaged to be married,

he tried to support himself by substitute teaching and by selling duplicating

machines on the road. He was beginning to think he'd better find something else

to do with his life when out of the blue a telegram arrived from an executive

at IBM who had seen one of Johnson's Markograph-and-girl publicity shots and

wanted him to come to New York.<p>



<p>



There was a hitch: IBM had been working on a test-scoring machine since 1928,

with no success. The goal of the team doing the work was apparently to buy and

shelve Johnson's machine and then keep going with its own. Johnson was so

desperate for money that selling the new, graphite-sensitive version of the

Markograph to IBM was fine with him, especially if IBM also gave him a job. In

July of 1934 he sold IBM the rights to his machine for $15,000--but he didn't

get the job. Ben Wood intervened; in August he wrote a personal letter to

Thomas Watson, with whom he had long worked to develop an automatic scorer, at

Watson's summer estate in Maine to advise him that his underlings were about to

deep-six Johnson's machine. Watson stepped in; Johnson was hired, and became an

IBM lifer who would be best known for another invention, the disk drive; and in

1936 an IBM machine descended from the Markograph was used to score tests for

the New York State Regents and the Providence, Rhode Island, public schools.

The machine was refined and made affordable over the next several years.

American students have marked multiple-choice answer sheets with No. 2 pencils

ever since.<p>



<p>



Also in 1936 Harvard began requiring all candidates for scholarships to take

the SAT. In general the admissions-testing situation was a patchwork.

Boarding-school boys still took the College Board essay exam, and often the

SATas well. The great majority of state universities used no admissions tests

at all, let in all applicants, and rid themselves of overenrollment by flunking

students. Many fly-by-night tests with no reliability or validity were being

peddled by hucksters to schools at all levels. The situation was analogous to

that of medicine in the nineteenth century: testing--in the view of its

promoters, at least--represented an immense scientific breakthrough with the

potential to revolutionize education, if not all of human affairs, but it was

being undermined by rampant disorganization, hucksterism, charlatanism, and

misinformation. So the idea of creating a single agency that would order the

chaotic welter of tests arose naturally in testing circles.<p>



<p>



As a first step in this process, Chauncey persuaded the College Board to offer

Brigham's SAT and achievement tests constructed under the supervision of Ben

Wood, together called the Scholarship Examinations, to scholarship applicants

not just to Harvard but to other elite colleges as well. The first

administration of the combined tests took place on April 24, 1937, at 150 sites

across the country, with Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and several other

colleges accepting the results; 2,005 studious and ambitious but not rich

youngsters took them. The success of the Scholarship Examinations led James

Bryant Conant to propose in the fall of 1937 that all the leading testing

agencies be formally merged. Ben Wood was a great supporter of this idea, and

so was William Learned, who had become director of the Graduate Record

Examinations for the Carnegie Foundation. Henry Chauncey, though not in their

league as a force in education, was all for it too.<p>



<p>



Immediately, in an article in a journal called <I>School and Society</I>, Carl Brigham

registered an objection. Although Brigham was not completely opposed to the

idea of a new, combined agency, he complained about its potential dangers

wittily ("It is probably simpler to teach cultured men testing than to give

testers culture") and at length. As a past sinner who had taken the pledge,

Brigham was aware of the temptation to rush new tests into positions of

authority they hadn't earned. He thought the new agency could easily yield to

this on a grand scale. Two problems in particular worried him: the standard

error on tests was too high for them to be suitable for determining

individuals' fates except in the emergency conditions of wartime, and any

organization that profited too greatly from a particular test would inevitably

become more interested in promoting the test than in honestly researching its

effectiveness and trying to improve it.<p>



<p>



In December of 1937, just after the article came out, William Learned took

Brigham to lunch to try to bring him around. Evidently it didn't go well.

Brigham had little use for Learned and Wood, because he thought that in their

eagerness to persuade the education world to adopt wholesale testing they were

leaping to unmerited conclusions about the data from their ongoing Pennsylvania

study, much as he thought he had done with the Army Alpha data in his younger

days. Also he was suffering from high blood pressure and was prone to fly into

dyspeptic rages. In January of 1938 Brigham wrote an amazingly ill-tempered

(given the politesse that then prevailed in higher education) five-page

single-spaced letter to Conant opposing the idea of merging the testing

agencies. He called the Army Alpha "atrocious" and the Carnegie Foundation's

Pennsylvania study "propaganda," and--the key point--warned that "the very

creation of powerful machinery to do more widely those things that are now

being done badly will stifle research, discourage new developments, and

establish existing methods, and even existing tests, as the correct ones."<p>



<p>



He went on: <p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

If the unhappy day ever comes when teachers point their students toward these

newer examinations, and the present weak and restricted procedures get a grip

on education, then we may look for the inevitable distortion of education in

terms of tests. And that means that mathematics will continue to be completely

departmentalized and broken into disintegrated bits, that the sciences will

become highly verbalized and that computation, manipulation and thinking in

terms other than verbal will be minimized, that languages will be taught for

linguistic skills only without reference to literary values, that English will

be taught for reading alone, and that practice and drill in the writing of

English will disappear.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



A month later Brigham wrote Conant to apologize for this outburst. "The

bitterness and unjustice of my personal remarks," he wrote, "were totally

unwarranted and entirely foreign to my make-up. I should have had sufficient

insight to recognize my own unbalanced state, but these conditions sneak up on

one so gradually that correct insight at the time is apparently impossible to

achieve." Still, for the author of the SAT to be an opponent of a new testing

agency was an impediment significant enough to derail the idea, at least

temporarily. <p>



<p>



One Sunday afternoon in 1941, according to College Board legend, a group of

board officials was sitting around in Princeton, talking about how nice it

would be to abolish the board's essay examinations and replace them with the

SAT, when the news of the attack on Pearl Harbor came in.<p>



<p>



Later that month the board decided to drop the logistically difficult and

labor-intensive essay exams "for the duration"and use the SAT and a separate

multiple-choice achievement test as its admissions examination.<p>



<p>



In January of 1943, at the age of fifty-two, Carl Brigham died.<p>



<p>



So, with the war on, big changes in testing were afoot: old-fashioned

college-admissions tests were finished, and Brigham, the main impediment to the

founding of a big new national testing agency, was gone. Testing was poised to

expand tremendously. All it needed was a justification.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>NATURAL ARISTOCRACY</font></b><p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE Scholarship Examinations represented a brand-new means--multiple-choice

mental testing--applied to a very old goal, choosing a society's elite on the

basis of merit. Despite the relative newness of the term "meritocracy" (it was

invented in 1958 by a British sociologist named Michael Young), the idea itself

long pre-dates this country's founding. Plato's <I>Republic</I> proposed that children

be taken away from their parents at the age of ten and put into the hands of

the education system, which would pick out a few to join the ranks of the

"guardians." Teachers would have "the duty of degrading the offspring of the

guardians when inferior, and of elevating into the rank of guardians the

offspring of the lower classes when naturally superior." Plato called this

system, which he regarded as ideal, aristocracy, and counterposed it to such

lesser systems as oligarchy ("the form of government in which rulers are

elected for their wealth") and democracy, by which he meant something akin to

what we would call socialism. A few centuries after Plato, China instituted the

first open competitive examination system for the selection of government

officials.<p>



<p>



In the West the original meaning of "aristocracy" was lost during the early

modern era, because the word became associated with feudal systems in which

wealth and status were inherited. Still, "aristocracy" had enough remaining

positive charge as late as the early nineteenth century for Thomas Jefferson to

be able to call, in a famous letter to John Adams, for replacing "an artificial

aristocracy founded on wealth and birth" with a Platonic "natural aristocracy"

based on "virtue and talents," whose members would be "sought out from every

condition of life" by the education system and then go on to govern the

country.<p>



<p>



The idea of a natural aristocracy, or meritocracy, has a powerful resonance in

the United States. Each succeeding American elite has considered itself to

embody the principle. But another idea is even more distinctively American: the

idea of universal individual opportunity. This idea does not appear to have a

distinguished philosophical lineage. It was simply here, to a far greater

extent than it was anywhere else in the world, almost from the very beginning.

"The first thing that strikes one in the United States is the innumerable crowd

of those striving to escape from their original social condition," Alexis de

Tocqueville wrote not many years after Jefferson's letter to Adams. "Every

American is eaten up with longing to rise."<p>



<p>



Before the Second World War, meritocracy, in today's sense of elite selection

through higher education, and opportunity, meaning the ordinary citizen's way

of getting ahead in the world, were two separate and unrelated concepts. Only a

tiny segment of the population went to college, and--more to the point--higher

education was not thought of as a gateway to financial success. (This country's

first formal meritocratic structure, the civil service, also was not perceived

as the path to America's lush rewards except, perhaps, by Irish-Americans, who

viewed it, with some justice, as a plot to shut them out of government jobs.)

Harvard, for example, was traditionally a place where rich men sent their sons

to become gentlemen, not a place for poor boys hoping to become rich--a point

memorably made by Benjamin Franklin in a spoof of Harvard that he wrote as a

teenager, in 1722:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

Now I bethought my self in my Sleep, that it was Time to be at Home, and as I

fancy'd I was travelling back thither, I reflected in my Mind on the extream

Folly of those Parents, who, blind to their Childrens Dulnes, and insensible of

the Solidity of their Skulls, because they think their Purses can afford it,

will needs send them to the Temple of Learning, where, for want of a suitable

Genius, they learn little more than how to carry themselves handsomely, and

enter a room genteely, (which might as well be acquire'd at a Dancing-School,)

and from whence they return, after Abundance of Trouble and Charge, as great

Blockheads as ever, only more proud and self-conceited.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



The idea that formal education was unnecessary or even inimical to economic

success was a staple of American popular culture from Franklin's time until the

mid-twentieth century. In works as adoring as Horatio Alger's novels and as

condemnatory as Theodore Dreiser's <I>The Financier</I>, the self-made man always

drops out of school and becomes a kind of apprentice to an older businessman as

the first step on the road to riches. <p>



<p>



It is true that universal free education is another distinctively American idea

of long standing: Jefferson proposed it in the first legislative session of the

State of Virginia, in order "to diffuse knowledge more generally through the

mass of people." The purpose he had in mind, though, was not to provide

economic mobility to all but to create a vehicle for the selection of the

natural aristocracy while equipping the masses for the basic duties of

citizenship, so that political democracy would work properly.<p>



<p>



But it took an amazingly long time for public education to take hold.

Jefferson's bill in Virginia didn't pass. All through the mid-nineteenth

century, reformers--most prominently Horace Mann, the secretary of education of

Massachusetts--worked ceaselessly to get public elementary schools established.

Not until after 1940 did a majority of American teenagers graduate from high

school. Since before the Civil War the main selling point for publicly

supported education had always been that the increasingly complex nature of

American society made it a prerequisite for business growth--not that it was a

fundamental right of the citizenry or a provider of individual opportunity. The

arena of most people's ambition was not school but the marketplace. <p>



<p>



Thus far Henry Chauncey's promotion of testing as a means of bringing

scholarship students into the Ivy League had been a natural-aristocracy

exercise with no effect on the country. His real goal was to test on a much

grander scale. If this was achieved, and if the test results were heeded, the

result would be the joining of a natural aristocracy with the previously

separate and more highly charged issue of opportunity. Chauncey was by no means

a social planner. He was fascinated by testing; any orderly process was likely

to appeal to him. It didn't occur to him that the possibility at hand was one

of channeling the roaring, ungoverned force of ambition in America. What he saw

before him was the prospect of a big new testing agency that would provide a

grateful populace with benign, rational guidance to its proper places in the

society. <p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>THE CREATED ARISTOCRACY</font></b><p>



<p>



<font size=5>F</font>ORTUNATELY for Chauncey and other testers, someone stood ready to supply a

broad vision that could justify what they wanted to do: James Bryant Conant.<p>



<p>



During the war years Conant wrote a series of three articles in <I>The Atlantic

Monthly</I> in which he laid out a sweeping plan to change the basic operating

procedures of the United States when peace came. In the first article,

published in 1940, he warned that the American tradition of equality of

opportunity was rapidly eroding, and that "we see throughout the country the

development of a hereditary aristocracy of wealth."The only institution that

could counteract this dire trend, he wrote, was the public education system,

which he called "a new type of social instrument . . . a vast engine which we

are only beginning to understand."<p>



<p>



The second article, published in 1942, urged the military not to pick officers

from the college-educated population only, because "a college education is a

privileged position based on family finances." Only public education, he said

again, could restore the key American ideals of opportunity, democracy, and

classlessness.<p>



<p>



The final article, called "Wanted: American Radicals" and published in 1943,

was the most perfervid of the three. First of all, Conant made it clear that

the radicalism he was endorsing was meant to be an alternative to Marxism,

which he saw as a far greater threat to the fabric of our society than Hitler:

hence <I>American</I> radicals--devotees of Jefferson, Jackson, Whitman, Emerson, and

Thoreau--as opposed to "European"ones. The American radical, Conant 

wrote,<p>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

believes in equality of opportunity, not equality of rewards; but, on the

other hand, he will be lusty in wielding the axe against the root of inherited

privilege. To prevent the growth of a caste system, which he abhors, he will be

resolute in his demand to confiscate (by constitutional methods) all property

once a generation.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



 To expand opportunity, though, the key means at hand was

not really confiscation but education, which alone could provide "the

equivalent of those magic lands of the old frontier"in "a highly mechanized,

industrialized age."And the end of the war would be "a God-given moment for

reintroducing the American concept of a fluid society,"in which people's roles

would be "determined by their merit, their talents, their character, and their

grit."<p>



<p>



Conant was obviously channeling the theories of Frederick Jackson Turner, the

frontier historian, who had been one of Harvard's leading professors during

Conant's undergraduate days, but his idea that America was developing an

aristocracy surely grew out of what he saw around him at Harvard. By 1910, when

Conant arrived there as a freshman, Harvard College had completed its long,

gradual transformation from a ministerial training school into an institution

dominated by the children of a distinct American upper class--mostly

northeastern and mostly in business. This class might be called the Episcopacy,

after its predominant religion.<p>



<p>



The formation of the Episcopacy, in the last decades of the nineteenth century,

represented the sudden resolution of what had appeared to be an irreconcilable

conflict between two rival elites:the old pre-industrial, New England--based

upper class, with its high-minded, non-urban mores, and the big, rough New

York--based Gilded Age rich. Large-scale conversion to Episcopalianism

(membership grew by 318 percent from 1860 to 1900), which combined the

traditionalism of the New England group with the grandeur of the New Yorkers,

was crucial to this merging of elites. So were the founding of British-style

boarding schools like Groton and Hotchkiss, and of new social institutions such

as country clubs, debutante societies, and restricted suburbs.<p>



<p>



Outsiders who somehow found their way into the educational institutions of the

Episcopacy during its heyday, however--people like Conant and Ben Wood and

even, to some extent, owing to his lack of money, Henry Chauncey--were usually

horrified by what they saw. The enormous heritability of status, the devolution

of the ideal of gentlemanliness into a glorification of undergraduate

carousing, the lack of academic standards, the casual and unearned assumption

of superiority, the inability to see immigrants, Catholics, Jews, and the poor

as fully human:the Episcopacy provided plenty of evidence to support the idea

that it was, as Newt Gingrich would say, a corrupt elite. <p>



<p>



Conant seems to have assumed that the Episcopacy held the whole country in as

firm a grip as it held Harvard--that's the only way to account for his sweeping

assertions about the ominous rise of a hereditary aristocracy in America.

Because he assumed that the United States looked like Harvard, he also assumed

that what was solving Harvard's aristocracy problem would solve America's:

providing free education to the talented, regardless of background. Conant, in

other words, envisioned the selection of a meritocratic elite by the Ivy League

as only the first step for higher education. The real goal was to expand public

colleges and universities to the point where they became a formal structure of

opportunity for nearly everybody. (Today 60 percent of high school graduates go

on to enroll in college.) The American radical, he wrote, "will favor public

education, truly universal educational opportunity at every level. He will be

little concerned with the future of private education. . . ."<p>



<p>



This conceptual leap of Conant's, born of disapproval of the Episcopacy, made

all the difference for testing. It changed the job at hand from picking a few

brilliant scholarship students for places like Harvard to organizing the social

mobility of most of the population. <p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=4><b>THE BIG CHANCE</font></b><p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE beginning of the war found Henry Chauncey in a state of some uncertainty

about his future. In 1932 he had married Elizabeth Phalen, a minister's child

like himself, and by Pearl Harbor Day they had two children and a third on the

way. This, along with his age, made it impossible for him to enlist in the

war--the otherwise natural course for Chauncey, a man who positively leaped to

duty when it presented itself.<p>



<p>



He had been an assistant dean at Harvard since 1929. The advantages of the job

were that he revered the institution and the man running it, Conant, and that

he had been able to undertake an important and successful project--the

broadening of the student body through the Harvard National Scholarships

program and the use of the SAT. Harvard's scholarship boys, whom Chauncey made

a special effort to get to know--including James Tobin, who would become a

Nobel Prize--winning economist; Caspar Weinberger, the former Secretary of

Defense; and John Morton Blum, who would become a renowned historian--had done

well enough that the idea of recruiting Harvard's students from all classes and

regions, according to academic merit, had taken root, even if the goal hadn't

nearly been achieved. Also, Chauncey had helped to promote the use by other

elite colleges of the SAT as a selection device for scholarship students.<p>



<p>



The main disadvantage of his job was that there was no real career track for

assistant deans. Often young men drawn from the pool of Boston Brahmins, they

were poorly paid and usually found it impossible to rise above a certain point

in the university hierarchy. After a few years they would go off and become

boarding-school headmasters, or switch careers. Henry Chauncey, though, who had

started out with the modest goal of eventually running a boarding school, by

now felt that he was part of an immensely significant movement that had the

potential to transform American life--testing. While everyone who knew Chauncey

thought of him as an ambitious man, his view of himself was that he was

selfless. Having been raised by his minister father and the minister headmaster

at Groton to revere "public service" above all else, he saw the possibility of

serving in an especially broad way through testing. But at Harvard most of the

faculty considered testing to be a sweaty, applied-technology field, of

interest to personnel managers and not a fit subject for scholars.<p>



<p>



Chauncey had calculated that his family could not afford to buy a house, so

they moved from one rental property to another in the Boston suburbs--Lincoln,

Watertown, Lexington, Lexington again, back to Lincoln. He seemed to be waiting

for his moment. He had gotten in on the ground floor of testing; he knew the

pioneers in the field personally; he had Conant's trust; and the war was

obviously going to shake everything up.<p>



<p>



Opportunity presented itself in the form of the U.S. Navy's V-12 program, in

which young men deemed especially promising were to be temporarily exempted

from the draft and allowed to get some college education before beginning their

service, so that they would be better able to perform higher-order military

tasks. Many prominent psychologists, educators, and testers joined the military

during the war, and one of them, Alvin Eurich, was running the Navy program. He

had the idea of selecting people through a standardized test administered to

high school seniors.<p>



<p>



At the time of the death of Carl Brigham, the College Board's tiny

testing-research office in Princeton was taken over by Brigham's No. 2 man,

John Stalnaker, a psychometrician who was a protege of Louis Leon Thurstone, of

the University of Chicago, one of the giants of testing. One weekend at the end

of 1942 Henry Chauncey went to Princeton to see Stalnaker, and they quickly

came to the conclusion that the College Board, rather than some other testing

organization, should be put in charge of the military's testing programs. The

two men began to move with the ferocious momentum of people who realize that

their big chance in life has arrived. Worried that the military bureaucracy was

about to turn testing programs over to the competing American Council on

Education, and feeling the need for an influential voice in Washington,

Chauncey took the highly unusual step of calling Conant at home over the

weekend to request an immediate meeting. Conant told Chauncey he was on his way

to Washington but they could meet there on Sunday night.<p>



<p>



Chauncey grabbed the first train out of Princeton, which went only as far as

the North Philadelphia train station. He booked a compartment so that he could

work on his presentation to Conant. At North Philadelphia he got off, changed

trains, and kept working--until the conductor who took his ticket told him that

the train was bound for Pittsburgh. He got off at the next stop and managed to

arrive in Washington only an hour late, without ruffling Conant's feathers

unduly. Chauncey made his pitch and Conant agreed to help; the Navy soon

designated the College Board, rather than the American Council on Education, as

its testing agency.<p>



<p>



Soon Stalnaker was off to Washington. In early February of 1943 Chauncey

received this scribbled note from Stalnaker, on Navy stationery:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

Dear Henry,<p>



Write to me at once at Room 3732 Navy Annex. . . . This is <I>at last</I> a real job.

Here is hoping that you are 38 and can write up your record to sound very

convincing on testing and selection. You should get a lt. commander commission

and take charge of the testing &amp; selection if all goes well. . . . Hurry.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



Within a few days Harvard had temporarily released Chauncey to the College

Board so that he could work full time on the Navy program.<p>



<p>



The long-term significance of the Navy test, and the reason for Stalnaker's and

Chauncey's excitement, lay in its scale. The SAT had never been given to more

than 18,000 people in one year, and so could not be considered a true survey of

even a large percentage of America's youth. For the College Board to test on a

grander scale than ever before, by a factor of ten or twenty, posed an immense

logistical challenge. The Navy test would be a matter of life and death, or at

least of induction and deferment, for its takers. The Army Alpha and Beta tests

that had been widely administered during the First World War were given under

notoriously sloppy conditions to people who knew nothing about testing; this

time the testing conditions had to be infinitely stricter. Every candidate for

a college deferment had to take the test at exactly the same time: there

couldn't be any copies floating around before or after. The scoring had to be

done quickly and without errors.<p>



<p>



Henry Chauncey was unlikely ever to become a university president, and he had

not been trained to be a psychometrician, but this was a job he could do. He

knew enough about testing to get reliable tests, he had nationwide contacts in

the education world who could help him set up the testing centers, and he was

naturally good at organizing things. On February 22, 1943, he and Stalnaker met

at a hotel in Washington with a hastily convened national group and sketched

out a basic plan: the test would be an adaptation of the SAT, and would be

administered through ten regional directors. Then Chauncey went to Chicago to

figure out how to get the tests printed and distributed. <p>



<p>



He had so little idea of how to proceed that he spent the train trip perusing

the want ads in the Chicago papers. When he arrived, he booked a room for a

month at the Stevens Hotel and began interviewing printers. He selected one

called Chicago Planograph, whose head had told him, "I'll make your dreams come

true." The tests would come back from the printer packaged on skids. Chauncey

had them delivered to his distributor, R. H. Donnelly, casually covered with

drop cloths, on the theory that if they were stamped TOP SECRET, somebody would

take one. Then Donnelly shipped them out to testing centers all over the

country. <p>



<p>



At the last minute the Army decided to use the same test for a similar

college-deferment program. On April 2, 1943, the Army-Navy College Qualifying

Test was administered to 325,000 young men. Their answer sheets were shipped

from the test sites to the ten regional offices, where they were scored by hand

(a fully operational, affordable scoring machine still lay in the future; two

of the test centers used prototype scoring machines and then rescored by hand).

Then, as a quality-control check, the answer sheets were shipped to the College

Board office in Princeton and rescored, by platoons of middle-aged women hired

for the occasion. <p>



<p>



Everything went well, evidently in a spirit not just of efficiency but of

home-front ebullience. At a testimonial dinner for Chauncey afterward, the

College Board staff sang him this ditty:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

He plans 'em, he makes 'em, he hands 'em out too.<br>



He scores 'em, reports 'em, a one-man test crew.<br>



Then with brow deeply furrowed, with thumbs in his vest,<br>



He calls from Chicago, "I gave the wrong test!"

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



The levity notwithstanding, something of consequence had just happened.

Chauncey had proved that standardized multiple-choice tests could be

simultaneously administered to enormous groups of people all across the

country. This meant that educational testing had, overnight, broadened its

potential scope from the elite to the masses.<p>

<font size=4><b>SCORING THE PROS AND CONS</font></b><p>



<p>



<font size=5>I</font>N June of 1944, after having administered a second year's Army-Navy test,

Chauncey returned to Harvard with a slightly grander title: assistant to the

dean of the faculty and chair of the Committee on Scholarships. What was on his

mind was finding a way to capitalize on his breakthrough with the College

Board. With Carl Brigham gone, the idea of merging all the country's leading

testing agencies into one could now be revived. The country seemed to be poised

on the brink of a new industrial revolution involving not machinery but people,

whose life trajectories, thanks to the science of testing, could be efficiently

and fairly organized.<p>



<p>



Set against this grand tableau was Chauncey's familiar life as an assistant

dean, which he found wrenchingly difficult to abandon. He approached Harvard

about the possibility of moving the College Board's testing office from

Princeton to Cambridge. That didn't work out, and Chauncey began to feel a

distinct if mild chill from his fervently respected boss, Conant. All through

late 1944 and early 1945 John Stalnaker pressed Chauncey to leave Harvard and

come permanently to the College Board, and Chauncey agonized. Finally he

decided to take his dilemma to Conant personally. He made an appointment.

Conant, suffering from a bad back, seemed even more formal and correct than

usual; when Chauncey asked him what the future at Harvard might hold, hoping

that Conant would say something about the grand possibilities of testing,

Conant instead asked Chauncey what kind of salary increase he had been hoping

for.<p>



<p>



Chauncey's admiration for Conant was so great that it was difficult for him to

admit even to himself that this hurt. The idea that he had come to Conant not

to discuss the future of testing at Harvard, and by extension of a crucial

issue in American life, but merely to ask for a raise! Conant's reaction was,

perhaps, a reminder that there was a class system in academic administration as

elsewhere, and the views on broad policy matters of assistant deans with only

bachelor's degrees were not of interest.<p>



<p>



Chauncey characteristically decided that the way to make his decision was to

quantify it. So he constructed a chart ranking Harvard and the College Board on

a three-point scale in each of sixteen categories. On the strength of superior

rankings in such categories as "Free Hand," "Job With Growing Future," and

"Respect of Colleagues for One's Work," the College Board won, 36--32. He took

the job. Having finally resolved the issue seemed to fill him with energy, and

whatever disappointment in Conant he felt was quickly laid aside. He shared

Conant's vision of universally accessible higher education, which after all

provided the theoretical undergirding for the expansion of testing that

Chauncey wanted to accomplish. When a columnist for a Boston paper criticized

one of Conant's causes--weeding out after the first year the lowest-ranking

ex-soldiers going to college on the GI Bill of Rights--Chauncey fired off a

letter to the editor:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

Equality of opportunity in the early days of our country did not mean that

every boy became the president of a bank, a railroad magnate or the captain of

a ship. But each boy did have the opportunity to rise to such positions if his

talents and industry qualified him.<p>



<p>



Today the lower rungs of the ladder of opportunity are educational. Climbing

these rungs involves the same competitive element entailed a century ago by the

ladder of economic opportunity.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



The great work ahead appealed to Conant and Chauncey equally strongly, but for

different reasons. To Conant, it was a social experiment aimed at fulfilling a

democratic ideal in a way that would also strengthen the country against its

enemies. To Chauncey, it was a big, challenging project that would create a

monument of order and structure. As he wrote in his diary, "The stage of

development in which testing is now in is the same as the railroads were in the

1850s--a lot of separate small lines. The big developments were to come in the

next two decades."<p>

the intention--on Henry Chauncey's part, at least--of testing the entire 

population on every possible trait.  Instead its success at measuring just 

one trait--the ability to get good grades in school--proves invaluable to 

the country's booming universities, and helps to create a new kind of

<img src="../../../dropcaps/i-small.gif" align=left height=44 alt="I">N the April, 

1948, issue of a publication called <i>The Scientific Monthly</i> an 

article appeared under the title "The Measurement of Mental Systems (Can 

Intelligence Be Measured?)." The authors, W.  Allison Davis and Robert J.  

Havighurst, were well-known liberal educators; Davis had written a book 

about the plight of young Negroes in the South, called <i>Children of 

Bondage</i>, and was one of the first black professors ever to get a job at 

a white university; Havighurst had recently worked as a consultant to the 

president of Harvard, James Bryant Conant.  The authors believed that 

intelligence tests were a fraud--a way of wrapping the fortunate children 

of the middle and upper-middle classes in a mantle of scientifically 

demonstrated superiority.  The article considerably troubled Henry 

Chauncey, the head of the fledgling <A 

HREF="gopher://gopher.ets.org">Educational Testing Service.</A> <p> </font>



<A HREF="etsbig.htm"><img src="./etssmall.gif" align=left border=0 vspace=10

hspace=10></A>



Even in 1948 the debate over IQ tests, which were not yet fifty years old, had

an eternal quality. The leading intelligence-testing researchers tended to be

true believers who thought they had found a way to measure the one essential

human ability--what the British psychometrician Charles Spearman, in a famous

1904 article, called "the general factor," or <i>g</i>. Most psychometricians

considered intelligence to be a substantially inherited, biologically grounded

trait.<p>

The overall results of intelligence tests have always produced a kind of

photograph of the existing class structure, in which the better-off economic

and ethnic groups are found to be more intelligent and the worse-off are found

to be less so. In his book analyzing the results of the intelligence tests that

the Army had given recruits during the First World War, for example, Carl

Brigham, an early psychometrician and the father of ETS's leading test, the

Scholastic Aptitude Test, reported that the highest-scoring identifiable group

was Princeton students--this at a time when, by today's standards, Princeton

was a den of carousing rich boys. <p>



<A HREF="./gsortind.htm"><img src="../../../images/shorsera.gif" align=right

vspace=10 hspace=10 border=0></A>





One of the main findings of American intelligence testing in Brigham's day was

that immigrants were less intelligent than native-born Americans, with the most

recent crop of immigrants being the least intelligent ever. The highest-scoring

group today is Jews, but in 1923, when most American Jews were recent

immigrants, Brigham reported that "our figures . . . would rather tend to

disprove the popular belief that the Jew is highly intelligent. . . ."

Aggregate IQ-test results have always been held up as proof of the innate

mental superiority of some ethnic groups over others; among the <i>g</i> men,

eugenicist policies like stringent immigration restrictions and measures to

discourage reproduction among people with low IQ scores have long found

advocates. A taste of this view, in an especially ill-tempered form, can be had

from a letter that Ben Wood, another founding father of testing and by then a

crotchety old man, wrote in 1972 to someone at the Educational Testing

Service:<p>

It may be said in all soberness that professional "reliefers" and most other

indigents who produce children thereby commit crimes against humanity which are

fully as serious as many acts now considered felonies. They have no moral right

to produce such children, and therefore should have no legal right to immunity

from punishment that constructively "fits the crime," such as some form of

painless sterilization of both guilty parents, which would be permanent. . .

.<p>

By the 1920s, not long after the introduction of IQ tests, a sweeping liberal

critique of them had appeared. Its three main tenets were: first, that the

tests were measuring cultural conditioning rather than a biological trait;

second, that there was no such thing as <i>g</i>--a single human ability more

important than all others--but instead a group of human abilities; and third,

that IQ tests could be misused to classify millions of young people as mentally

inferior and so to deny them opportunity. To liberals, IQ tests mostly measured

the taker's education and language fluency, which explained why poor people and

immigrants tended to score so low.<p>

Not all critics of the idea that intelligence is inherited and immutable were

psychometrically illiterate save-the-world types. As Stephen Jay Gould pointed

out in <i>The Mismeasure of Man</i>, several of the fathers of intelligence

testing, including Lewis Terman, H. H. Goddard, Carl Brigham, and even Charles

Spearman, backed away from their <i>g</i> enthusiasm over time. Brigham,

especially, became a vituperative critic of <i>g</i>. From the standpoint of

ETS, perhaps the most important of the <i>g</i> critics was Louis Leon

Thurstone, of the University of Chicago. A former assistant to Thomas Edison

and a founder of the Psychometric Society and the journal <i>Psychometrika</i>,

Thurstone was so austerely dedicated to his work that he had a blackboard

mounted in his house so that he could conduct seminars. Thurstone believed that

human intelligence consisted of several distinct factors rather than any single

one, and he helped to develop a technique called factor analysis that would

enable this truth to be expressed statistically. <p>

But at the time of the founding of ETS, in 1948, the IQ debate was dormant. IQ

testing had been a major public issue in the early 1920s and would later become

one again, but for some time there had been no great controversy about it.

Congress passed laws severely restricting immigration in 1921 and 1924, with

the result that people stopped worrying that the country was being flooded by

the mentally inferior. During the Depression perhaps a third of all Americans

were poor--it was difficult to chalk up to feeblemindedness the difficulties of

so many people. And Adolf Hitler's embrace of eugenics put the movement in a

bad light. <p>

Because IQ was not an issue in the late 1940s, a curious situation obtained:

the father of the SAT, Brigham, was on record as believing that there was no

such thing as general intelligence, but the main promoters of the wide use of

the SAT regarded it rather casually as an intelligence test. In 1937 Henry

Chauncey, then an assistant dean at Harvard engaged in persuading the Ivy

League schools to adopt the SAT as a scholarship test, made the following

notes:<p>

1) Much less in the way of factual or formal learning is now felt to be

necessary for the successful carrying on of college work than was expected a

generation ago.<p>

2) Possibly more intellectual powers--ability to handle problems in a chosen

field of study--are required today than formerly.<p>

3) Intelligence tests are an aid to admissions practically unknown a generation

ago.<p>

As Chauncey remembers it now, during the 1940s Conant, who had long since

approved the SAT for use in Harvard's national scholarship program, used to say

he suspected that the SAT was actually an achievement test. Chauncey would

argue back that it measured a combination of innate and learned qualities. It

was clear to Chauncey that the more Conant thought that the SAT measured native

intelligence, the happier he would be with it.<p>

<p><b>UNCOMFORTABLY<br>

SIMILAR TESTS</b><p>



<font size=5>B</font> UT now here was the article in <i>The Scientific

Monthly</i>, attacking

intelligence tests for measuring only "a very narrow range of mental

activities" and for being "a strong cultural handicap for pupils of the lower

socioeconomic groups." Without mentioning the SAT specifically, the article

treated academic-aptitude and IQ tests as closely related--which, in fact, they

were and still are. IQ tests have always heavily stressed reading comprehension

and vocabulary items like analogies and antonyms, and so does the verbal

section of the SAT. Back in the early days Carl Brigham published a scale for

converting intelligence-test scores to SAT scores. Paul Diederich, a

contemporary of Henry Chauncey's who was for decades a researcher at ETS,

expresses a view common in the field: "IQ tests are reading comprehension and

vocabulary doctored up to look like reasoning. To change the SAT to an IQ you'd

simply divide the score by an age measure. Basically they're the same thing."<p>

The similarity between IQ and academic-aptitude tests can be explained in part

through the testing concept called validation. Even if a test produces a

reliable score--that is, one that changes little between administrations--it

isn't much good unless it can be shown to predict something. Validation is a

comparison of the test score with some other outcome. IQ testers have always

thought that IQ scores are a good predictor of overall individual success and

achievement, but historically it has been difficult to validate IQ convincingly

against much besides performance in school. (To make a very long story short,

IQ scores tend to be somewhat predictive of job performance but much more

predictive of school performance.) <p>

By definition, of course, an academic-aptitude test like the SAT is validated

against grades in school. To the extent that IQ testers know that their work

will be validated against school performance, they construct their tests to

predict school performance as accurately as possible. The SAT is constructed

with prediction of school performance as the sole goal. All tests validated by

school grades will necessarily be quite similar.<p>

The <i>Scientific Monthly</i> article attacked intelligence tests on just these

grounds: because they measure primarily "academic or linguistic activities"

rather than general intelligence, the use of school performance to validate IQ

scores is "circular." The validation is too similar to the test itself. "A

teacher's rating of a pupil," the authors wrote, "is an estimate of the pupil's

performance on the same kind of problems as those in the standard tests." <p>

Davis and Havighurst represented the left-wing position in midcentury

psychometrics: for example, they treated IQ as being much more the product of

learning and culture than inheritance. But there were plenty of leading and not

particularly left-wing psychometricians who, for reasons similar to theirs, had

reservations about the use of aptitude testing to sort students. Besides

Thurstone there were, for example, Ralph Tyler, of the University of Chicago,

and E. F. Lindquist, of the University of Iowa, both giants in the field. In

the early days of ETS, Henry Chauncey offered both Tyler and Lindquist jobs,

but each man, perhaps unwilling to leave academe, turned him down and went on

to become a thorn in the side of ETS. In the late 1950s Lindquist founded the

American College Testing Program; the company is today ETS's chief competitor

in the college-admissions field.<p>

The last thing Henry Chauncey needed in 1948, with ETS a shaky newborn calf,

was for the IQ controversy to break out again. So, although he was not

generally a defensive person, he reacted a little touchily to the <i>Scientific

Monthly</i> article. "They take the extreme and, I believe, radical point of

view that any test items showing different difficulties for different

socio-economic groups are inappropriate," he wrote in his notebook, and went on

to take a mildly hereditarian position on intelligence tests.<p>

If ability has any relation to success in life parents in upper socio-economic

groups should have more ability than those in low socio-economic groups. And if

there is anything in heredity (such as tall parents having tall children) one

would expect children of high socio-economic group parents to have more ability

than children of low socio-economic group parents.<p>

Chauncey was also a liberal, and conciliatory by nature, so he was eager to

incorporate the more practicable of Davis and Havighurst's ideas into the

operations of ETS. Like many liberal critics of testing over the years, Davis

and Havighurst shared with the believers in <i>g</i> an orderly

social-scientific mind-set. They believed that the problems they perceived in

testing were best addressed not by de-emphasizing testing and letting society

sort itself out in a more haphazard fashion but by constructing tests that were

free of cultural bias. <p>

The culture-free test on which the poor will get high scores has proved to be a

chimera, for the obvious reason that educational tests measure a

comfortableness in the classroom that usually doesn't go with growing up in

difficult circumstances. But in 1948 Henry Chauncey, with his limitless belief

in testing, naturally liked the idea of his organization's improving its tests.

For example, new items might be developed that would be fairer to all groups.

Chauncey thought that he was already well on the way to answering Davis and

Havighurst's central accusation--that tests were too narrowly focused on

academic ability--by having ETS develop new tests to measure other abilities,

using different validating procedures. Aptitude testing was only a phase,

beyond which the field, now entering its great era, would surely move. The

point was not to drop aptitude testing but to add to it.<p>

ETS therefore wound up in an odd position with respect to intelligence testing.

Within the organization and its ambit there have always been pockets of belief

in <i>g</i> as an inherited trait. Chauncey's extremely conscientious No. 2

man, William Turnbull, though not a <i>g</i> man, confessed in a 1963 memo to

Chauncey that he harbored a "long-held conviction that `native intelligence'

has some point to it." But officially ETS has always been opposed to IQ testing

and to the concept of general intelligence. (Only last year ETS's usually

mild-mannered president, Nancy Cole, wrote a blistering attack in the

organization's in-house newspaper on the latest manifestation of the <i>g</i>

theory, Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's <i>The Bell Curve</i>.) The

quality the SAT was measuring was "developed ability"--not intelligence.<p>

ETS's research department, the topflight group of psychometricians whose

ability to work at the frontiers of testing was the rationale for creating a

large nonprofit testing agency like ETS in the first place, pointedly did not

settle any of the controversies about intelligence testing, such as whether IQ

is something innate or learned. Instead its bread and butter was tightly looped

validations of the SAT, beginning with a 1948 study called "The Prediction of

First-Term Grades at Hamilton College." These studies would produce a basic

correlation coefficient between SAT scores and the grades of college freshmen.

In the case of Hamilton College, for example, it was .30 for the verbal score

and .27 for the math score. This meant that each score could predict about a

tenth of the variance in grades among freshmen. If you combined high school

grades and SATs into a single number--an exercise Henry Chauncey had helped to

invent back in the 1930s, in his assistant-dean days at Harvard--you got a

correlation with freshman grades of more than .50. The SAT, then, was an

instrument that would add a few percentage points to the ability of the high

school transcript to predict grades in the freshman year of college (the

correlation between SAT scores and grades dropped off after the freshman year).

That was a very long way from <i>g</i>.<p>

The trouble with ETS's neat public distinction between developed ability and IQ

is that because of the similarity in content between the tests, the correlation

between SAT scores and IQ is very high. Arthur Kroll, an ETS official who has

worked on the SAT, estimates that the correlation between the verbal score and

IQ is .60 to .80--that is, much, much higher than the correlation between SATs

and freshman grades. The correlation is rumored in <i>g</i> circles to be even

higher than that. A sociologist named Steven Goldberg, in a 1991 book, wrote,

"One can not but be impressed by the astonishing correlation of SAT scores and

scores on the standard IQ tests, a correlation about as high a nontrivial

correlation as one ever finds in the social sciences." But he didn't cite a

source; finding a published study of the correlation is well-nigh impossible.

(<i>The Bell Curve</i> also mentions the correlation; the source listed for it

in the footnotes is a College Board publication that contains many statistics,

but not that one.)<p>

The similarity of the SAT to an IQ test can actually be seen as undercutting

the <i>g</i> position. <i>G</i> is supposed to be immutable, but SAT scores

vary demonstrably over time according to the degree of specific preparation for

the test. If the same were shown to be true of IQ scores, then IQ would begin

to look like a measure of developed ability rather than SAT scores looking like

a measure of <i>g</i>. Those are merely matters of theory, though. Had ETS

initially taken the position that the SAT is an IQ test, the result would have

been the resurgence of the IQ debate, and the SAT would not have gone into

widespread use. As ETS later discovered, in America there is a strong note of

populist resentment against intelligence testing (only last year it helped to

make the movie <i>Forrest Gump</i> a big hit), and the organization has usually

managed not to excite it. With remarkable uniformity ETS's university clients,

too, have artfully blurred the similarity between the SAT and an IQ test; a

slipup such as was made last year when Francis Lawrence, the president of

Rutgers University, said that few blacks have the "genetic, hereditary

background" to get high SAT scores can tear a school apart. Distancing the SAT

from IQ has been crucial to its success. <p>

If, in fact, the SAT is an IQ test, then the ironic result of ETS's (sincere)

insistence that it is not one has been to produce, in the postwar United

States, the most thoroughly IQ-tested society in the world.<p>

<p><b>THE CENSUS <br>

OF ABILITIES </b><p>



 <font size=5>C</font>HAUNCEY contemplated the IQ issue as part of an intensive

program of reading

and thinking he undertook during the late 1940s. After long, complex

negotiations, the tiny College Board testing office in Princeton had become the

Educational Testing Service (which opened for business on January 1, 1948;

Henry Chauncey, president), home of all the leading educational tests in

America. In past years Chauncey had relied on others--chiefly Conant, his boss

at Harvard--to provide the educational vision he had helped carry out. Now

Chauncey was the head of his own organization and needed a vision of his own.<p>

During the war the idea had come to Chauncey of administering a grand national

battery of tests to all of American youth. It was the chance to do this that

made leaving Harvard seem worthwhile to him, and as ETS got under way, he

thought about his plan more and more. He called it the Census of Abilities.<p>

Conant's main interest was in expanding higher education to the point that it

would become a new American opportunity structure, to replace the vanished

frontier. Every year testing would find the few hundred most promising youths,

wherever they might be, and route them to schools like Harvard and Princeton.

But this was only the first stage of Conant's plan. What he really wanted was

to see the more democratic state universities expand to the point where they

would set practically everybody on the path to success and the Ivy League would

become nearly irrelevant. <p>

Chauncey's idea for the Census of Abilities sprang from a deeper faith in

testing and order. He wanted to test every American beginning in the ninth

grade--and to test not just for educational potential but for every human

quality. A typical list of what he wanted the Census of Abilities to cover,

from an entry in his notebook in 1947, is this:<p>

. . . personal qualities, some of which may be drive (energy), motivation

(focuses of energy), conscientiousness, intellectual stamina . . . ability to

get along with others. . . . interests, such as aesthetic, religious, abstract,

social, economic, political, manipulative.<p>

Finding standardized tests of persistence and of sense of humor were also

long-standing interests of Chauncey's. He wanted ETS to be as good at testing

the human personality as at testing academic potential. Although he was no

intellectual and rarely read for pleasure, he drove himself to keep up on the

psychological literature of the day, because it might give him useful ideas for

the Census of Abilities. Everything that might contribute to testing interested

him, from graphology (the study of handwriting) and somatotyping (the study of

the relationship of body type to personality type) to the deepest of depth

psychology.<p>

Unlike his minister forebears, he was unable to believe that religion provides

humanity with its mainspring, but he did want there to be some other

mainspring--a core group of ennobling values that would raise people above the

state of nature. Testing could somehow become part of a scientific substitute

for religion, which would perform the social function historically assigned to

the Church, only better. In his notes he kept returning to a twist he had

invented on William James's famous phrase "the moral equivalent of war": "What

I hope to see established is the moral equivalent of religion but based on

reason and science rather than on sentiments and tradition." The first step was

to establish the Census of Abilities. <p>

The ideal sponsor for the census, Chauncey had always thought, would be the

federal government, with its reach and resources and high purpose. In May of

1948 he wrote out a prospectus for a "Census of the Abilities of the American

People and Their Relation to Job Requirements," presumably to be undertaken by

ETS with the backing of an unspecified government agency. The prospectus was

wildly ambitious, making the current activities of ETS, which were themselves

very ambitious, appear puny by comparison. The government would first

administer, through ETS, "a battery of perhaps twenty to fifty tests" (few of

which had yet been constructed) to more than 100,000 people in the labor force.

Then it would test the educational attainments of a million eighth- or

ninth-graders. This would pave the way for a grand technological match- up

between the nation's human resources and its economic needs.<p>

Chauncey received one expression of interest in the Census of Abilities from

the Air Force and another from the Selective Service System, which drafted men

into the armed services. Somehow he was able to parlay these nibbles into an

appointment with W. Stuart Symington, the head of the National Security

Resources Board and a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of President Harry Truman's, who

later became a U.S. senator from Missouri. Chauncey sent Symington a detailed

proposal and then called on him on July 6, 1950. The meeting was a terrible

disappointment, as recounted in notes Chauncey made the next day:<p>

He was about fifteen minutes behind-hand on appointments but greeted me with

apologies in a very friendly manner. He is a strikingly good-looking and

pleasant person.<p>

Hardly had I explained how I happened to be there than he, after one question

on what I meant by human resources, suggested that I write him a letter stating

what I had in mind. . . .<p>

With that I bowed out, having taken about five minutes of his time and learned

how top government executives operate.<p>

That was the end of the Census of Abilities, at least as a founding project for

ETS. It had a residue, however. The grandeur of purpose that Chauncey initially

had in mind for ETS remained somehow attached to everything the organization

did--even when the job at hand was mundane or ill conceived. Henry Chauncey was

always certain that he was doing what his minister father called the Lord's

work. Although the Census of Abilities failed to materialize, ETS went forward

with the full, almost messianic sense of mission that had been generated in

Chauncey's mind. Instead of an all-encompassing Census of Abilities, what ETS

wound up conducting, with consequences for Americans that were just as large

but with none of the breadth of Chauncey's idea, was a national census of just

one ability: the ability to get good grades in school.<p>

<p><b>IQ JOE</b><p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE first couple of years were financially rocky for ETS. Its

signature

product, the SAT, was an admissions requirement for College Board schools, but

the membership of the College Board itself was still small. The now-familiar

graduate school tests, all offered by ETS in its early years--the Graduate

Record Examinations, the Medical College Admissions Test, the Law School

Admissions Test, and the Graduate Management Admissions Test--were either

brand-new or still in development. Henry Chauncey was certain that ETS could

become a nationwide mass administrator of educational tests within a few years;

he was constantly pushing to expand the organization. ETS's first branch office

was all the way across the country, in Berkeley, California. But Chauncey, a

practical man, realized that the federal government was potentially the biggest

single customer for testing. With one contract the government could provide the

kind of business that it would take years to build up in academia. In a March,

1950, letter to his counselor on financial matters, a Harvard Business School

professor named Robert Merry, he wrote,<p>

Incidentally, there are a number of activities in the air which, if they should

materialize, would quite substantially change the picture, namely, a

scholarship program in the National Science Foundation Bill, a Federal

scholarship program, and classification testing for Selective Service.<p>

The first of these possibilities was the closest to Chauncey's heart, because

during the 1940s he had worked on the government commission that had

recommended the creation of the National Science Foundation. But the last was

the live prospect. The Selective Service System was run from 1941 until its

abolition, nearly three decades later, by General Lewis B. Hershey. Hershey's

artfully maintained persona was that of a country boy, a rumpled cracker-barrel

philosopher; he spoke often of his humble upbringing, by a nearly illiterate

father in rural Indiana, and he liked to deliver lengthy homespun discourses

that rambled from military issues to the nature of farm life and back again. As

his tenure demonstrates, Hershey was an extremely adept bureaucrat; and,

appearances to the contrary, he was also a fan of intelligence testing.<p>

Once the Cold War began in earnest, with the establishment of the Truman

Doctrine in 1947, there was concern, even alarm, in official circles about the

way America deployed its human resources. Many of the scientists who had worked

on the development of the atomic bomb were European refugees, and thus not

products of the American education system. In the future, the argument went, we

were unlikely to be so lucky in our ability to import top scientific talent,

and we would have to develop our own. But Ph.D. programs in physics and the

other hard sciences were underfunded and underenrolled. Elementary and

secondary education were controlled by thousands of local school boards with

widely varying policies, whereas the Soviet system--at least as Americans then

imagined it--worked with ruthless efficiency to identify and nurture people who

might as adults lend special abilities to the national struggle. Because of the

Cold War, the United States now needed urgently to do two things it had never

done: maintain a large standing army in peacetime and create a system for

developing talent, especially in scientific fields with potential military

applications. <p>

At the forefront of the leaders who wanted to steer the nation toward these

goals was Henry Chauncey's mentor, James Bryant Conant. Conant took the Soviet

threat extremely seriously; he thought that beyond the danger that the United

States might fall behind scientifically, the country's basic social cohesion

was at risk. Any country that did not provide some opportunity to all would be

ripe for a turn to Marxism--even the United States. Conant wanted to see an

expansion of higher education not just as a mechanism for producing a new

technocratic elite but also as a way of expanding opportunity and thereby

making the country stronger and more united. Universities would provide both

elite selection <i>and</i> mass opportunity.<p>

In the late 1940s Conant became one of the country's leading proponents of

universal military training. If every young man had to fulfill some obligation

to his country, he thought, it would generate a democratic, classless,

burden-sharing spirit that would be both good on its own terms and a bulwark

against communism. President Truman was also a supporter of universal military

training. When Congress passed the Selective Service Act of 1948, which

required universal draft registration but not universal training, it was a loss

for Truman and a blow to Conant.<p>

Among Hershey's first moves after the passage of the act was setting up a

series of six scientific advisory committees to the Selective Service System.

Henry Chauncey was a member of one of them. Although the committees didn't

issue a public report until the end of 1950, the direction in which they were

moving soon became clear to people on the inside: they would be recommending a

draft deferment for college students who did well on an aptitude test.<p>

This was the antithesis of Conant's vision, but it had its own Cold War

rationale. Future scientists--those most precious of military

resources--shouldn't have their training interrupted. They would be deferred,

not exempted, from the draft; the implication was that by the time they did

serve, their potential would be so clearly defined that they would not be put

at personal risk in combat. <p>

There was, of course, a long-standing military tradition of having people with

specialized skills, such as doctors, serve in the area of their expertise

rather than as infantry soldiers. But this was different. Despite the

committees' rhetorical emphasis on scientists, the real idea was to defer a

whole class of people--those high in aptitude, no matter what their field. As

Chauncey wrote in a memo about a talk by Hershey in January of 1949, people

would be "deferred, not for a specific responsibility, so much as for their

potential worth."<p>

Hershey, who did not at the outset grasp the fine distinctions in testing,

originally wanted to make an IQ test the basis for the deferment and to

administer it only to college students. This was just seven years after Conant,

in this magazine, had angrily described college attendance as purely a function

of parental income. And Hershey wanted to make students who took the test pay

for it out of their own pockets. As if to overcome Chauncey's potential

objections, Hershey told him early on that he planned to recommend that a

single testing agency be designated to conduct the broad-scale testing for the

deferment program. In 1949 there was only one candidate--ETS.<p>

The situation had all the makings of an exquisite moral dilemma for Henry

Chauncey. One can imagine him spending long nights agonizing over the conflict

between the clear interest of his organization in the deferment program and his

wish to avoid either the abandonment of the liberal democratic vision that he

and Conant shared or a direct clash with Conant, who was the first chairman of

the board of ETS. But Chauncey was not one for exquisite moral dilemmas. He was

the head of ETS. The key to his behavior was his belief that his organization

was good and that what was in its best interests was good for America and even

for humanity. He and Conant began with similar premises about the importance of

the Cold War and the need to change traditional ways of doing things. It was

difficult for Chauncey to imagine that a major testing program could have a bad

result, even though its aim was to create the kind of student deferments that

Conant feared would promote social divisions--and added to this faith in

testing was his institutional ambition for ETS. America did need to manage its

human resources in a more orderly way, especially in this unsettled time. <p>

In June of 1950 the Korean War began. Hershey's advisory committees, which

hadn't done much for a year, quickly reconvened. By October they had produced a

preliminary report that specifically recommended ETS as the agency to conduct

draft-deferment testing. In December the committees issued the final, public

version of the report, written in the lurid language of crisis. "We, the

citizens of the United States now face the greatest test in the history of the

Nation," it began. The committees anticipated and tried to answer the arguments

against a deferment exam. To subject all college students to the draft "would

virtually stop the production of superior scientific, professional and

specialized personnel." It was important to exempt students in all disciplines,

not just those on a brief list of militarily essential fields, because "to

prepare such a list calls for an omniscience which sane men hesitate to claim."

The committees acknowledged that the college population was not democratically

selected or representative of all classes. But an "unwise manpower and

Selective Service policy" should not be put in place because of an "inadequate

national policy with regard to the distribution of educational opportunity."<p>

Just as the report was coming out, Conant announced the formation of the

Committee on the Present Danger, an organization of eminent members of the

establishment concerned about the Cold War. Conant's committee was ardently in

favor of universal military service--not just training--and opposed to the

draft-deferment test for college students. On March 19, 1951, the Selective

Service System signed a contract with ETS, and on March 31 Truman signed an

executive order authorizing the test. The great trial by fire of Chauncey's

life began.<p>

<p>

<b>ETS ARRIVES</b><p>

<font size=5>E</font>TS first of all had to do the logistical work involved in a

mass test

administration: construct the test, print it under secure conditions, and line

up testing sites. Because of the judgment-of-God importance of the test, the

large number of takers, and the demands of the military, all of this was

unusually difficult. Chauncey requested the help of the FBI in maintaining test

security, and he made plans for the test takers to be fingerprinted at the

sites. The test itself was to be based on the SAT, but the Selective Service

wanted it to be scored--or, in testing language, "scaled"--in such a way that

the results could be compared with those of the Army General Classification

Test given to inductees, a more nakedly IQ-like test.<p>

In the days preceding Truman's executive order Hershey publicly referred to the

deferment test as an IQ test. Chauncey quickly put a stop to that, and also

persuaded Hershey that the Selective Service should not charge the test-takers

a fee. "The test should not be looked upon or referred to as an `intelligence

test,'" he wrote Hershey. "There are many kinds of intelligence; the ability

revealed by this test is more properly called `scholastic aptitude.' This means

nothing more than the ability to do well in school or college." The same could

be said about IQ tests themselves: during the Second World War 80 percent of

college students, then thought to be a notoriously unmeritocratic group, had

scored at or above 120 on the Army General Classification Test, as against 16

percent of all recruits. For the purpose of administering the deferment test

smoothly, though, there was no need to question the concept of IQ. The point

was to stress the distinction between it and scholastic aptitude. Thus the test

was scaled so as to produce a score that wouldn't read like an IQ score: the

scale was zero to 99, the mean was 50, and the "cutting score" at which a

student would be deferred was 70, equivalent to an IQ of 120.<p>

As soon as Truman signed the executive order, an immense outcry against the

deferment test began. The editorial cartoonist for the <i>Sacramento Bee</i>

showed Joe Stalin walking into his propaganda department with a self-satisfied

grin, holding a piece of paper that said PRESIDENT TRUMAN ADVOCATES DRAFT

DEFERMENT FOR COLLEGE BOYS--U.S. TO INITIATE CASTE SYSTEM. The <i>Philadelphia

Inquirer</i>'s cartoon showed THE AVERAGE GUY standing looking at JOE COLLEGE up

on a pedestal that was labeled SUPER-CITIZEN FAR AND

ABOVE THE CRASS AND SORDID DEFENSE OF COUNTRY. The local draft board in Beaver

County,

Oregon, resigned in protest. The draft board in Grand Rapids, Michigan, refused

to issue deferments on the basis of test results. The president of Princeton

attacked the idea, and so did America's most famous university educator, Robert

Maynard Hutchins, a former chancellor of the University of Chicago. Conant

submitted to a radio interview with a fellow member of the Committee on the

Present Danger, Edward R. Murrow, of CBS, who got him to agree on the air that

draft-deferment testing "stinks." The IQ-testing movement had been dogged from

the very beginning by the charge that people high in IQ were prone to be

intelligent misfits, scrawny, nearsighted, and weird; several commentators now

revived this line of argument, saying that the test would be selecting and

rewarding people like America's two leading domestic villains of the day, the

brainy traitors Klaus Fuchs and Alger Hiss.<p>

Henry Chauncey had previously demonstrated that he was a gifted administrator

who could organize the complicated technical and logistical aspects of mass

testing. But he had not been a public figure--that had always been Conant's

role. Now, with Conant on the other side and the unpolished Hershey prone to

excessive frankness, Chauncey had to rush in to defend the test. Through the

spring and summer of 1951 he was constantly speaking, conferring, and being

quoted. Over and over he patiently and reasonably explained that the test was

for draft deferment, not exemption; that making a score of 70 didn't mean a man

had an IQ of 70; that people in the top half of their college classes would be

deferred no matter what their test scores were; that the nation desperately

needed to keep the pipeline of scientific talent flowing. When someone

prominent criticized the test, Chauncey would never lose his temper. He would

generally seek to meet with the person and explain his position--ideally in

Princeton, so that the meeting could be combined with a tour of ETS's

operations and followed by a dinner at the Chauncey home or at a charming inn

in the nearby countryside of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Even Conant, whose

criticism Chauncey considered "unnecessarily violent," was quickly on good

terms again with Chauncey.<p>

The controversy over the test began to die down. Chauncey's efforts were no

doubt part of the reason. Another part was that even if Conant had lined up

most of the leaders of elite higher education against the idea of creating a

new intellectual elite with a military deferment, mass higher education, as

represented by the American Council on Education, staunchly supported the test.

The state universities were just beginning two decades of remarkable growth,

which would have been threatened by an exodus of students into the Armed

Forces. The situation was ironic. When ETS was beginning, Conant had insisted

on bringing in the American Council on Education and its tests, because mass

higher education was so important to him. Chauncey had been unenthusiastic

about the idea. Now the council, acting as a big, muscular education-interest

group, was Chauncey's essential ally, without whose support the draft-deferment

test might have languished. Whether or not the state universities provided

opportunity to all, as Conant wished them to, they certainly provided ETS with

institutional strength.<p>

After the first test administrations, in the spring and summer of 1951, went

off smoothly, the tone of press coverage changed, perhaps because ETShad hired

its first public-relations consultant. There was less emphasis on the idea that

the test was introducing a class division between, as one cartoonist put it, GI

Joe and IQ Joe, and more on the wonders of testing and its importance as a tool

in the Cold War. In the gee-whiz tone characteristic of coverage of industrial

technology during the 1950s, the stories often discussed the use of IBM's

scoring machine to do the grading. <p>

About two thirds of the college students who took the test, in those days of

minimally selective admissions, scored at or above the cutting score of 70 and

so were deferred from the draft. In 1951 there was no interest, inside or

outside ETS, in what would today be the main question about the test

results--score differences between ethnic groups--and no women took the test.

To ETS executives what leaped out from the results was the substantial regional

differences in the pass rates: 73 percent of college students in New England

made a 70 or above, but only 42 percent in the Deep South did. The other main

finding was that education majors scored far below students in every other

field of study. Fortunately for ETS, neither the South nor schools of education

went on the attack against the test. The main residue of the test results was

to leave Chauncey convinced that because the quality of the people who became

teachers was so low, the best way to improve American schools would be to

invent machines that could teach--an interest he pursued for decades, in the

characteristic hope that science could correct human frailty.<p>

The terms of the contract between ETS and the Selective Service were unusually

favorable to ETS. Because of this, and because the testing went so smoothly,

ETS made a windfall profit on the contract: about $900,000, an amount just

below half of what the organization's annual revenues had been in each of the

preceding years. This money instantly solved ETS's financial difficulties and

allowed it both to continue its research on new tests and to expand its reach

across the landscape of American education.<p>

ETS had arrived, and not only financially. Everyone now knew that it was the

scientifically impeccable, public-spirited nonprofit research organization that

dominated testing in America, and everyone in higher education, at least, knew

that Henry Chauncey was the statesman-technocrat who so ably ran it and spoke

for the interests of testing in general. All the potentially most dangerous

issues for ETS came up during the draft-deferment-test controversy, and they

proved not to be crippling: the idea of sorting vast numbers of Americans,

rather than just a few applicants to Ivy League colleges, on the basis of

multiple-choice aptitude tests; the idea of a new national elite of the brainy;

and the idea that a public function as important as mass testing could be

performed by a private organization, rather than by government. If such matters

had only a limited charge when the tests were being used to help decide who

would be sent into battle, then they would most likely be even less nettlesome

when the purpose of the tests was merely to aid admissions officers.<p>

After the first year of administrations of the draft test, during a long

meeting with Chauncey to discuss the future, Hershey said that he wanted to

carry the principle behind the test further than he would have dared before

Chauncey's adept handling of the controversy. He told Chauncey that he was

making provisional plans to eliminate the deferment for fathers, which had been

sacrosanct even during the Second World War, in order to make more room on the

deferment lists for the intellectually gifted. <p>

The issue never came to a head, because the number of combat troops in Korea,

and hence the need for inductions, was by then rapidly decreasing. What is

remarkable is how completely Hershey believed that in the atomic age there was

a need to keep potential scientists out of the line of fire--a need so pressing

that it necessitated abandoning all previous American ideas about who should

bear the burden of service in wartime. Once a principle is established, it

quickly takes on the trappings of tradition, and also generates a

constituency--in this case consisting of universities and the broad

upper-middle class from which most of their students came. That may help

explain why there was barely any controversy during the Vietnam War over the

deferment of college students and graduate students--even though, unlike 1951,

it was a time of dissent--or later over the abolition of the draft in favor of

a voluntary military, which meant that for the college-going class there would

be no obligation to serve at all.<p>

When ETS's contract with the Selective Service System came up for renewal, in

1954, a testing company on the way to becoming its arch-rival, Science Research

Associates of Chicago, submitted a lower competing bid and won the job. The

news came as a shock to Chauncey--SRA was a private business out to make money,

not to serve the public!--but he quickly recovered and went to Washington to

see General Hershey. "I explained that I just wanted to drop in and tell him

how much we had enjoyed working with Selective Service on the draft deferment

program and that I understood the reason for accepting a lower bid," Chauncey

wrote in his notes of the meeting. "I went on to say that we were anxious to

make the transition as smooth as possible." Chauncey's good sportsmanship paid

off: ETS got the contract back five years later. In any case, SRA, because of

its low&nbsp;bid, made much less money from the draft test than ETS did. The

Selective Service contract had gotten ETS over its initial difficulties, and

now it was in a position to ride the expansion of higher education.<p>

<p><b>AMERICA'S <br>

PERSONNEL OFFICE</b><p>

<font size=5>I<font>N 1951 there were 2.1 million Americans enrolled in

institutions of higher

learning, in 1956 nearly 3 million, in 1961 more than 4 million, and in 1970,

the year Henry Chauncey retired from the presidency of ETS, 8.6 million. This

growth was unmatched in any other country in the world, and it made higher

education into something it had never been before--the personnel office for

white-collar America. The country's booming corporations began to require a

college degree as a prerequisite for white-collar employment. The politics of

expanding higher education was wonderful. Governors and legislators, and later

the federal government, were able to deliver to middle-class constituents a

much appreciated and at the time usually inexpensive benefit. Architects,

engineers, and contractors (who often contribute generously to political

campaigns) got work in enormous university-building projects in every state. As

educational aspirations spread and universities sought to regulate the flood of

people entering their gates, ETS grew too. University faculties had increased

to the point that America had a real academic class for the first time in its

history--a class that generally supported the widespread use of standardized

testing. Because the tests were financed by the fees takers paid, they cost

ETS's customers nothing. And using them provided an objective explanation for

tough decisions and obviated the need for administratively disruptive mass

flunk-outs. In 1960 Chauncey's many years of lobbying in Berkeley finally paid

off: the University of California system began requiring applicants to take the

SAT, and thus was on its way to becoming ETS's single largest client by far.

Annual administrations of the SAT passed one million in 1963-1964 and were 1.8

million in 1994-1995.<p>

In retrospect what is striking about the expansion of higher education, and the

concomitant reordering of a good portion of American society, is how sketchy

the rationale for it was. Perhaps, like most transforming social changes, it

just happened, rather than being planned. Although the passage of the GI Bill

of Rights, toward the end of the Second World War, is now remembered as a

national commitment to provide a college education as a kind of franchise of

citizenship, the bill was conceived as a temporary and fairly standard

government reward and readjustment effort for veterans, and education was not

thought of as its most important component. The argument made during the 1940s

and 1950s for a change in national policy toward higher education was

essentially the same argument about the need for Cold War scientists and

administrators that was used to justify the Korean War draft test. The bill

that finally established the practice of large-scale federal aid to education,

the National Defense Education Act of 1958, was passed soon after the launching

of <i>Sputnik</i>.<p>

It quickly became clear that the supply of new scientists was coming from

schools that specialized in science; Hershey's idea that if the generally able

were sought out, nurtured, and protected, they would wind up using their

abilities in a national-security-enhancing manner turned out not to be true. A

study done at the time of the passage of the National Defense Education Act,

for example, showed that only one Ivy League school--Cornell--was even in the

top fifty in the production of scientists. What the new national elite did with

their lives, in the main, was go into law, medicine, finance, and liberal-arts

scholarship--what Ivy League graduates had done for decades. In 1991, upon his

retirement as president of Harvard, Derek Bok wrote a book complaining that

graduates of elite colleges could not be induced to pursue careers in public

service. Conant's vision for Harvard and places like it has been substantially

realized in the intake, but not in the outflow.<p>

<p><b>THE GOLDEN AGE</b><p>

<font size=5>T<font>HIS didn't matter at all for any of the players in higher

education, including

ETS. In the years following the first administrations of the draft-deferment

test Henry Chauncey's life and that of his institution entered a golden period.

Chauncey's marriage had long resembled a miniature Cold War; he and his wife,

Elizabeth, lived essentially separate lives under the same roof, raising their

three sons and one daughter. Elizabeth had no interest in the ceaseless

activities that went along with being a chief executive's spouse. In the spring

of 1953 she told Chauncey she wanted a divorce. Those were the days when only a

few states had the lenient divorce laws that prevail now, so it was decided

that Henry Chauncey would spend eight weeks over the summer living in Wyoming,

where his Harvard roommate operated a dude ranch, and would obtain the divorce

there. His friend put him to work doing jobs for the ranch, including picking

up guests at the nearest airport. When he was on one such mission, a young

woman from New York named Laurie Worcester, who had recently graduated from

Smith College and was working at <i>Life</i> magazine, stepped off the plane.

She and Chauncey, who was about twice her age, fell in love. In 1954, after

they both visited a psychiatrist at the insistence of her parents, to make sure

that she was not merely under the sway of a father fixation, they were married.

Chauncey had a second set of four children, all girls.<p>

In 1955 Chauncey persuaded ETS to buy a 340-acre farm a few miles outside

Princeton, and ETSbegan constructing a landscaped campus-style headquarters,

with the main buildings named for James Bryant Conant, Carl Brigham, Ben Wood,

and L. L. Thurstone. The Chaunceys lived in the old farmhouse, in a setup quite

like that of the president of a university and his wife. Laurie Chauncey took a

special interest in the landscaping of the ETS campus. They entertained

frequently; at the annual employee picnic Henry Chauncey would put on a chef's

hat and cook the hamburgers. Some of the flavor of the Chaunceys' life can be

gotten from a letter Laurie submitted to <i>Ladies Home Journal</i> in 1957 for

a best-husband contest. "It's an objective fact that he is the most remarkable

man alive," she wrote. "`Alive' is a pretty feeble word to use for the

combination of vitality and humanity that is unique with Henry. . . ." (Laurie

Chauncey died, of cancer, in 1975; Henry Chauncey, now aged ninety, lives in

Shelburne, Vermont.)<p>

During the 1950s and 1960s the College Board added hundreds of new member

universities, many of which would send representatives to see firsthand the

wonders of the ETS operation. Chauncey went on lengthy official visits to

Australia and New Zealand and, three times, to the Soviet Union. ETS's

competitors were in a near-constant state of agitation; after much urging by

them, the Internal Revenue Service undertook an investigation of whether ETS

really deserved to be a nonprofit institution, and so to pay no taxes. (ETS

hired a former IRS commissioner as its special Washington counsel, and was able

to retain its nonprofit status.) But after the initial outcry over the draft

test there was only the barest hint of adverse public reaction to the spread of

testing. When a critic would emerge, Henry Chauncey would usually right away

invite him or her to visit ETS, and after they had talked, the criticism would

at least take on a more muted and responsible tone. <p>

Until 1957 the takers of the SAT were not even informed of their scores.

Neither were their high schools. The test-prep industry consisted of a

self-employed teacher named Stanley H. Kaplan who offered SAT tutoring (which

ETS regularly assured the public was ineffectual) out of his mother's basement,

in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. The role of ETS in American society, though less

pervasive than Chauncey had originally hoped it would be, nonetheless was

considerable, and it was established with great speed and smoothness. ETS

became the agent of what one College Board official liked to call "the Great

Sorting," providing higher education with a national standard for measuring the

scholastic aptitude of millions of people.<p>

Chauncey certainly did not see himself as being involved in a

social-engineering operation, a deliberate, if quiet, effort to remake American

society. In 1992 Chauncey wrote Gregory Anrig, then the president of ETS, "I

tend to be a little wary of people who use the word meritocracy." But he also

wanted to feel that he was doing something grander than helping schools to

improve their ability to predict the first-year grades of potential students.

In 1961 <i>Time</i> magazine published an article on the twelve most

outstanding college seniors in the country; after it appeared, Chauncey ordered

up their SAT scores (something the president of ETS can't do anymore, because

the scores are protected by a series of elaborate and ever-changing security

measures) in order to satisfy himself that the SAT was predictive of real

leadership as well as academic ability. Ten of the twelve did have high scores

(Martin Feldstein, a future head of the Council of Economic Advisers, had a 723

verbal and a 759 math), and one of the two low scorers was an immigrant from

Poland whose performance could be explained by his lack of enough language

familiarity to score well on the verbal portion.<p>

<p><b>TESTING'S <br>

MIXED RESULTS</b><p>

<font size=5>C</font>HAUNCEY'S own feelings notwithstanding, the great success of

the SAT and other tests that selected people on the basis of their predicted

grade-point averages achieved distinct social results. One was that the

Episcopacy--the American elite that prevailed during the first half of the

twentieth century--faded in importance. It had thought of itself as

meritocratic, and its definition of merit involved nonintellectual qualities

like character and leadership. Now many of the institutions it had dominated

passed into the hands of people high in academic ability. Thanks to the

Episcopacy's good sportsmanship (as always, this contained an element of

self-interest: its members obtained far gentler treatment than displaced elites

usually get), the power shift took place with remarkably little of the rancor

that usually accompanies such things. Henry Chauncey gamely accepted the

wait-listing of one of his daughters by Harvard College, whose second president

had been a Chauncey.<p>

Today the academically selected elite does not control America to nearly the

extent that is commonly assumed. Business, either corporate or entrepreneurial,

isn't really its territory, and neither is career government service or

elective politics. (The exceptions in these areas are small patches of ground

that were formerly the domain of the Episcopacy and have now been turned over

to high-test-score meritocrats: the career diplomatic service in government,

and investment banking in business. Not coincidentally, in both cases ETS has

been involved in the means of entry: the Foreign Service Examination and the

admissions test for graduate business schools.) But in certain areas, mainly

the professions, it does make up a recognizable class--brainy, isolated,

coast-dwelling, culturally liberal, and economically less so. Its rise has

coincided with the economy's increasing need for and rewarding of high levels

of skill. Still, the particular skills that SATs and similar tests measure are

most consistently found in those fields that use such tests to decide who will

enter. Rather than being an inevitable product of the forces of economic

history, the professional elite was <i>created</i>, in large part through the

efforts of Chauncey, Conant, and their colleagues.<p>

Just as important as, or more important than, the effect of the Great Sorting

on the composition of the American elite has been its effect on everyone else.

We have a different social order now. Henry Chauncey--who, when ETS was

beginning, privately compared the situation in testing to that of railroads in

the 1850s--helped to create the human equivalent of the standard gauge, which

nationalized and systematized the mobility of people instead of goods. The

railroad standard gauge created big business, and then economic concentration

of power became controversial; mass educational testing gave America's

long-standing obsession with opportunity an institutional structure, and then

education and employment became controversial. Frustrated aspirations now have

a target. It's no accident that the civil-rights and feminist movements, and

their oppositions, have fought so many of their battles over the new system of

rationalized admissions and employment. Many of the dozens of Supreme Court

cases on civil rights over the past four decades have involved the issues of

access to education and the proper use of test scores; the current controversy

over affirmative action would not be taking place if there were no standardized

tests. The most poignantly naive of the expectations of the founders of the

system was that an ordering of American opportunity, if it was based on

scientific principles, would be universally appreciated and would make the

nation less contentious--would even provide it with a strong moral center.<p>

Broad-scale testing in America was intended to be two things at once: a system

for selecting an elite and a way of providing universal opportunity. The second

purpose generates the public consent that supports the first. Controversy about

one produces instability in the other. An irony of the American meritocracy,

now that it has been in operation long enough to produce not just future

leaders but present ones, is that the leaders chosen by a mechanism designed to

be perfectly open and fair are widely regarded as a pampered, out-of-touch,

undemocratic in-group--much the way Conant regarded the Episcopacy. American

politics is now like an upside-down version of Plato's <i>Republic</i>: the

party of the common man is led by the first President to be a pure product of

the postwar meritocratic apparatus, and the party of business is led by a

speaker of the House who did much less well than the President at accumulating

meritocratic credentials, and who regularly delivers blistering attacks on

"elites." <p>

One consequence of the public's doubts about the meritocratic system and the

leaders it has produced is an unwillingness to pay the taxes that are needed to

support the great public-education machine that Conant thought would replace

the frontier as a guarantor of opportunity in America. As the resistance has

caused the dream of a first-class free education for all to fade, the people

who have suffered are those at the bottom of the social structure. They don't

really have a frontier.<p>

It was Henry Chauncey's good luck, in a lucky life, not to have to think about

much of this while he was running ETS: the new elite hadn't emerged, and the

arguments hadn't started. Whenever there was public grumbling about testing and

education, though, he took it seriously. In 1955 a liberal weekly called <i>The

Reporter</i> published an article called "The Quizmasters Fasten Onto Higher

Education"; Chauncey persuaded the ETS board to let him hire another

public-relations adviser to ponder the implications. The man he hired, Earl

Newsom, in 1957 produced a report that was prophetic about what lay in store

for ETS after Henry Chauncey retired. Newsom said this:<p>

Its tests have influenced and in many cases determined the careers of millions

of people including many of those who will provide the national leadership of

the future. As an institution of national scope dealing in the guidance of

human lives, it has no close parallel in our society.<p>

Under the circumstances it is well to remember that the idea of any center of

power, perhaps particularly one which classifies people, is historically viewed

with misgivings by Americans. It has gotten both governmental and private

institutions into trouble again and again.<p>

Trouble in fact rained on Chauncey's quiet, bespectacled successor, William

Turnbull. Chauncey would have turned aside some of it, because he was better at

the things for which there were no standardized tests, such as being adept with

people. But some of the trouble was unavoidable and, in a way, was Chauncey's

fault, because it stemmed from a fundamental misreading of the country's

character. Chauncey took the helm at ETSbelieving that we were witnessing, as

he once put it in his notebook, "The Dawn of Social Science": a new historical

age was beginning in which rationality would become the leading force in human

affairs, and people would gratefully accept the guidance provided by the

amazing new ability of technology to assess their capabilities. Chauncey

thought that America was just waiting to be put into a rational order, if only

the right system could be devised. He did help to devise a system, and America

adopted it. But the country didn't stop being fundamentally unruly.

<blockquote>

<font size=5>I</font> have tried to make an <i>Inferno</i> in English that

stays true to the nature of English, and that conveys the meaning of the Italian as accurately as

possible, in lines of <i>terza rima</i> that will suggest some of the force and

suppleness of Dante's form. Above all, I have tried to translate a poem: in

passages where my English is not literal, I hope that it is faithful to the

spirit.<p>



	Dante invented <i>terza rima</i> (the interlocking rhyme pattern <i>aba</i>,

<i>bcb</i>, <i>cdc</i>, etc.) for the <i>Commedia</i>, and its

effect--combining onward movement with a feeling of conclusiveness in each

step--seems integral to the poem, something well worth trying to approximate.<p>



	It may be helpful to say a few words about rhyme:<p>



	Italian is rich in rhyme, while English--despite having a far greater number

of words--is relatively poor in rhyme. Therefore, the triple rhymes of the

original can put tremendous strain on an English translation. One response to

this strain, one way of dealing with the torturous demands of <i>terza rima</i>

in English, has been to force the large English lexicon to supply rhymes:

squeezing unlikely synonyms to the ends of lines, and bending idiom ruthlessly

to get them there.<p>



	This translation rejects that solution and instead makes a more flexible

definition of rhyme, or of the kind and degree of like sound that constitute

rhyme.<p>



	But on the other hand, I have not accepted just any similar sounds as rhyming:

the translation is based on a fairly systematic rhyming norm that defines rhyme

as the same consonant-sounds--however much vowels may differ--at the ends of

words. For example, the opening tercets of Canto I include the triads

"tell/feel/well," "sleep/stop/up," and "night/thought/it."<p>



	This system of like sounds happens to correspond to some preferences of my own

ear, a personal taste: for me such rhymes as, say, "swans/stones" or

"gibe/club" or "south/both" often sound more beautiful and interesting than

such hard-rhyme combinations as "bones/stones," "rub/club," or "south/mouth."

This idea of harmony seems even more clear with disyllabic or "feminine"

endings: "faces/houses" is more appealing than "faces/places"; "flavor/quiver"

has more interest than "flavor/savor" or "giver/quiver."<p>



	The reader who recognizes these examples I have taken from poems by Yeats, who

is a master of such consonantal rhyming, might speculate that such sounds are

<i>similar for English</i>: roughly as "like," perhaps, in the context of

English and its great sprawling matrix of sounds, as are "<i>terra/guerra</i>"

or "<i>belle/stelle</i>" in the tighter Italian fabric.<p>



	But such speculation aside, and regardless of my own predilections,

consonantal or "Yeatsian" rhyme can supply an audible scaffold of English

<i>terza rima</i>, a scaffold that does not distort the English sentence, or

draw excessively on the reaches of the English lexicon. In this scaffolding,

mere vowel rhymes--even as close as "claim/feign" or "state/raid"--have been

arbitrarily excluded, as taking away some of the backbone or stringency of

effect. The goal is to make enough of a formal demand to support the English

sentence, but not so monstrous a demand as to buckle it, or to mangle the

particularly delicate gestures English syntax and idiom make as they accomplish

work another language might perform with inflected endings.<p>



	(It remains to add that by extension words which end in vowels can be rhymed

by a consistent system in which round vowels rhyme with one

another--"now/throw," or "clue/saw"; as can closed vowels--"be/why" or

"stay/cloy"; and, that disyllabic rhyme so sticks out in English that it can

acceptably be made a step more approximate, as in

"bitter/enter/blunder"--perhaps it <i>must</i> be made more approximate, in

order to avoid the comic feeling of limerick, or of W. S. Gilbert.) <p>



	This is a brief outline of the general principles behind a work which in

practice, as the reader will see, does not apply them without occasional

compromises and slidings. As to hard rhymes, there are many, but as I worked I

often found myself revising them out, or striving to make them the first and

third members of a triad, rather than adjacent, to keep them from leaping out

of a pattern I have labored to make expressive in its variations.<p>



<p>



Though we call it a form, verse is physical, and in this sense the sounds of a

poem are its body. By devising <i>terza rima</i> as the body for a poem about

the fates of souls and bodies, Dante added an expressive element as well as a

kind of movement. His variations in tone and idiom--from direct to elaborately

rhetorical, for example, or from high to low--have an emotional truth that

moves in counterpoint with the current of interlocking rhymes.<p>



	In Canto XII, when Virgil and Dante come down a rocky slope and approach the

chief centaur Chiron, wise teacher of heroes, Chiron makes an interesting

observation to his followers:<p>



<p>

<blockquote>



	<i>As we came close,</i><br>



	<i>Chiron drew an arrow's notch back through the tangle</i><br>

<p>



 



	<i>Of beard along his jaw to clear a space</i><br>



	<i>For his large mouth, and to the others he said:</i><br>



	<i>"Have you observed how that one's steps displace</i><br>



<p>



	<i>Objects his body touches? Feet of the dead</i><br>



	<i>Are not accustomed to behave like that."</i><br>



<p>

</blockquote>



Dante displaces the physical stones of the infernal world, though shades like

Virgil who dwell there do not. And yet, in an apparent contradiction, Virgil

sometimes carries the body of Dante about, as in Canto XXIII:<p>



<p>



<blockquote>



<i>My leader took me up at once, and did</i><br>



<i>   As would a mother awakened by a noise</i><br>



<i>   Who sees the flames around her, and takes her child,</i><br>



<p>



<i>Concerned for him more than herself, and flies</i><br>



<i>   Not staying even to put on a shift:</i><br>



<i>   Supine he gave himself to the rocky place</i><br>



<p>



<i>Where the hard bank slopes downward to the cleft,</i><br>



<i>   Forming one side of the adjacent pouch.</i><br>



<i>   No water coursing a sluice was ever as swift</i><br>



<p>



<i>To turn a landmill's wheel on its approach</i><br>



<i>   Toward the vanes, as my master when he passed</i><br>



<i>   On down that bank that slanted to the ditch,</i><br>



<p>



<i>Hurtling along with me upon his breast</i><br>



<i>   Not like his mere companion, but like his child.</i><br>



</blockquote>



<p>



I suggest that this is not simply an inconsistency, but another indication that

the relation between the two poets, living and dead, Christian and pagan, one

of them still embarked on his venture, the other having completed his, is a

relation between worlds: a point of intersection within a dense web of moral

and physical realities.<p>



	Embodiment, in some such sense, is the <i>Inferno</i>'s action, and its

meaning, and its method. The prosodic embodiment Dante invented for his poem is

characterized by tremendous forward movement, a movement that, in English, the

prose translations have sometimes rendered more effectively than those in

verse. To catch some of that quality, at once propulsive and epigrammatic, I

have allowed myself the liberty of enjambment, at times letting the sentence

run over the rhymed line ending more aggressively than in the original, and

also crossing freely from tercet to tercet. This translation is not

line-for-line, nor tercet-for-tercet. In order to represent Dante's succinct,

compressed quality along with the flow of <i>terza rima</i>, I have often found

it necessary to write fewer lines in English than he uses in Italian. The

Italian line and sentence not being the same as the English line and sentence,

I have hoped to imitate some of Dante's formal energy, in the body of an

English equivalent. This equivalent form, rising from the flow and arrest of

enjambed English sentences, seemed to require stanza breaks between the tercets

of the translation--partly because the white space is a visual register of the

consonantal <i>terza rima</i>.<p>



	To the image of Virgil skidding downhill on his back, while clasping Dante to

his chest, Dante adds the simile of water coursing through a sluice to turn the

regularly spaced vanes of a millwheel. This simile can serve as an image of the

relation of lines and stanzas, like regular vanes, to the surging fluid of the

sentence. At the same time, the motion of the embracing poets represents a

related dynamism of spirit, word, and matter. This translation's arrangement of

rhyme, sentence, line, and stanza attempts hopefully, sometimes perhaps

desperately, to find a commensurate relation of elements--improvised and

imperfect at every point but pushing on: trying to turn the wheel surely enough

to accomplish what work it can.<p>

<blockquote>



Midway on our life's journey, I found myself<br>

   In dark woods, the right road lost. To tell<br>

   About those woods is hard--so tangled and rough<br>

<p>

And savage that thinking of it now, I feel<br>

   The old fear stirring: death is hardly more bitter.<br>

   And yet, to treat the good I found there as well<br>

   <p>



I'll tell what I saw, though how I came to enter<br>

   I cannot well say, being so full of sleep<br>

   Whatever moment it was I began to blunder<br>

<p>

Off the true path. But when I came to stop<br>

   Below a hill that marked one end of the valley<br>

   That had pierced my heart with terror, I looked up<br>

<p>

Toward the crest and saw its shoulders already<br>

   Mantled in rays of that bright planet that shows<br>

   The road to everyone, whatever our journey.<br>

<p>

Then I could feel the terror begin to ease<br>

   That churned in my heart's lake all through the night.<br>

   As one still panting, ashore from dangerous seas,<br>

<p>

Looks back at the deep he has escaped, my thought<br>

   Returned, still fleeing, to regard that grim defile<br>

   That never left any alive who stayed in it.<br>

<p>

After I had rested my weary body awhile<br>

   I started again across the wilderness,<br>

   My left foot always lower on the hill,<br>

<p>

And suddenly--a leopard, near the place<br>

   The way grew steep: lithe, spotted, quick of foot.<br>

   Blocking the path, she stayed before my face<br>

<p>

And more than once she made me turn about<br>

   To go back down. It was early morning still,<br>

   The fair sun rising with the stars attending it<br>

<p>

As when Divine Love set those beautiful<br>

   Lights into motion at creation's dawn,<br>

   And the time of day and season combined to fill<br>

<p>

My heart with hope of that beast with festive skin--<br>

   But not so much that the next sight wasn't fearful:<br>

   A lion came at me, his head high as he ran,<br>

<p>

Roaring with hunger so the air appeared to tremble.<br>

   Then, a grim she-wolf--whose leanness seemed to compress<br>

   All the world's cravings, that had made miserable<br>

<p>

Such multitudes; she put such heaviness<br>

   Into my spirit, I lost hope of the crest.<br>

   Like someone eager to win, who tested by loss<br>

<p>

Surrenders to gloom and weeps, so did that beast<br>

   Make me feel, as harrying toward me at a lope<br>

   She forced me back toward where the sun is lost.<br>

<p>

While I was ruining myself back down to the deep,<br>

   Someone appeared--one who seemed nearly to fade<br>

   As though from long silence. I cried to his human shape<br>

<p>

In that great wasteland: "Living man or shade,<br>

   Have pity and help me, whichever you may be!"<br>

   "No living man, though once I was," he replied.<br>

<p>

"My parents both were Mantuans from Lombardy,<br>

   And I was born <i>sub Julio</i>, the latter end.<br>

   I lived in good Augustus's Rome, in the day<br>

<p>

Of the false gods who lied. A poet, I hymned<br>

   Anchises' noble son, who came from Troy<br>

   When superb Ilium in its pride was burned.<br>

<p>

But you--why go back down to such misery?<br>

   Why not ascend the delightful mountain, source<br>

   And principle that causes every joy?"<br>

<p>

"Then are you Virgil? Are you the font that pours<br>

   So overwhelming a river of human speech?"<br>

   I answered, shamefaced. "The glory and light are yours,<br>

<p>

That poets follow--may the love that made me search<br>

   Your book in patient study avail me, Master!<br>

   You are my guide and author, whose verses teach<br>

<p>

The graceful style whose model has done me honor.<br>

   See this beast driving me backward--help me resist,<br>

   For she makes all my veins and pulses shudder." . . . <br>

   Away from here and through an eternal place:<br>

<p>

To hear the cries of despair, and to behold<br>

   Ancient tormented spirits as they lament<br>

   In chorus the second death they must abide.<br>

<p>

Then you shall see those souls who are content<br>

   His empire is everything and everywhere,<br>

<p>

But that is His kingdom, His city, His seat of awe.<br>

   Happy is the soul He chooses for that place!"<br>

   I: "Poet, please--by the God you did not know--<br>

<p>

Help me escape this evil that I face,<br>

   And worse. Lead me to witness what you have said,<br>

   Saint Peter's gate, and the multitude of woes--"<br>

   And now I can hear the notes of agony<br>

<p>

In sad crescendo beginning to reach my ear;<br>

   Now I am where the noise of lamentation<br>

   Comes at me in blasts of sorrow. I am where<br>

<p>

All light is mute, with a bellowing like the ocean<br>

   Turbulent in a storm of warring winds,<br>

   The hurricane of Hell in perpetual motion<br>

<p>

Sweeping the ravaged spirits as it rends,<br>

   Twists, and torments them. Driven as if to land,<br>

   They reach the ruin: groaning, tears, laments,<br>

<p>

And cursing of the power of Heaven. I learned<br>

   They suffer here who sinned in carnal things--<br>

   Their reason mastered by desire, suborned.<br>

<p>

As winter starlings riding on their wings<br>

   Form crowded flocks, so spirits dip and veer<br>

   Foundering in the wind's rough buffetings,<br>

<p>

Upward or downward, driven here and there<br>

   With never ease from pain nor hope of rest.<br>

   As chanting cranes will form a line in air,<br>

<p>

So I saw souls come uttering cries--wind-tossed,<br>

   And lofted by the storm.<br>

<blockquote>



"Poet," I told him, "I would willingly<br>

	Speak with those two who move along together,<br>

	And seem so light upon the wind." And he:<br>

<p>

"When they drift closer--then entreat them hither,<br>

	In the name of love that leads them: they will respond."<br>

	Soon their course shifted, and the merciless weather<br>

<p>

Battered them toward us. I called against the wind,<br>

	"O wearied souls! If Another does not forbid,<br>

	Come speak with us." As doves whom desire has summoned,<br>

<p>

With raised wings steady against the current, glide<br>

	Guided by will to the sweetness of their nest,<br>

	So leaving the flock where Dido was, the two sped<br>

<p>

Through the malignant air till they had crossed<br>

	To where we stood--so strong was the compulsion<br>

	Of my loving call. They spoke across the blast:<br>

<p>

"O living soul, who with courtesy and compassion<br>

	Voyage through black air visiting us who stained<br>

	The world with blood: if heaven's King bore affection<br>

<p>

For such as we are, suffering in this wind,<br>

	Then we would pray to Him to grant you peace<br>

	For pitying us in this, our evil end.<br>

<p>

Now we will speak and hear as you may please<br>

	To speak and hear, while the wind, for our discourse,<br>

	Is still. My birthplace is a city that lies<br>

<p>

Where the Po finds peace with all its followers.<br>

	Love, which in gentle hearts is quickly born,<br>

	Seized him for my fair body--which, in a fierce<br>

<p>

Manner that still torments my soul, was torn<br>

	Untimely away from me. Love, which absolves<br>

	None who are loved from loving, made my heart burn<br>

<p>

With joy so strong that as you see it cleaves<br>

	Still to him, here. Love gave us both one death.<br>

	Caina awaits the one who took our lives."<br>

<p>

These words were born across from them to us.<br>

	When I had heard those afflicted souls, I lowered<br>

	My head, and held it so till I heard the voice<br>

<p>

Of the poet ask, "What are you thinking?" I answered,<br>

	"Alas--that sweet conceptions and passion so deep<br>

	Should bring them here!" Then, looking up toward<br>

<p>

The lovers: "Francesca, your suffering makes me weep<br>

	For sorrow and pity--but tell me, in the hours<br>

	Of sweetest sighing, how and in what shape<br>

<p>

Or manner did Love first show you those desires<br>

	So hemmed by doubt?" And she to me: "No sadness<br>

	Is greater than in misery to rehearse<br>

<p>

Memories of joy, as your teacher well can witness.<br>

	But if you have so great a craving to measure<br>

	Our love's first root, I'll tell it, with the fitness<br>

<p>

Of one who weeps and tells. One day, for pleasure, <br>

	We read of Lancelot, by love constrained:<br>

	Alone, suspecting nothing, at our leisure.<br>

<p>

Sometimes at what we read our glances joined,<br>

	Looking from the book each to the other's eyes,<br>

	And then the color in our faces drained.<br>

<p>

But one particular moment alone it was<br>

	Defeated us: <i>the longed-for smile</i>, it said,<br>

	<i>Was kissed by that most noble lover</i>: at this,<br>

<p>

This one, who now will never leave my side,<br>

	Kissed my mouth, trembling. A Galeotto, that book!<br>

	And so was he who wrote it; that day we read<br>

<p>

No further." All the while the one shade spoke,<br>

	The other at her side was weeping; my pity<br>

	Overwhelmed me and I felt myself go slack:<br>

<p>

Swooning as in death, I fell like a dying body.<br>

<p>

	<center><i><font size=4>Though it is commonly believed that American health-care delivery and research

benefit men at the expense of women, the truth appears to be exactly the

opposite</i></font></center><p>

	

	<pre>



	</pre>

	

	

	<font size=5>"W</font>hen it comes to health-care research and delivery, women can no longer be

treated as second-class citizens." So said the President of the United States

on October 18, 1993.<p>



<p>



He and the First Lady had just hosted a reception for the National Breast

Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group, after receiving a petition containing 2.6

million signatures which demanded increased funding for breast-cancer

prevention and treatment. While the Clintons met with leaders of the group in

the East Room of the White House, a thousand demonstrators rallied across the

street in support. The President echoed their call, decrying the neglect of

medical care for women.<p>



<p>



Two years earlier Bernadine Healy, then the director of the National Institutes

of Health, charged that "women have all too often been treated less than

equally in . . . health care." More recently Representative Pat Schroeder, a

co-chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, sponsored legislation

to "ensure that biomedical research does not once again overlook women and

their health." Newspaper articles expressed similar sentiments.<p>



<p>



The list of accusations is long and startling. Women's-health-care advocates

indict "sex-biased" doctors for stereotyping women as hysterical

hypochondriacs, for taking women's complaints less seriously than men's, and

for giving them less thorough diagnostic workups. A study conducted at the

University of California at San Diego in 1979 concluded that men's complaints

of back pain, chest pain, dizziness, fatigue, and headache more often resulted

in extensive workups than did similar complaints from women. Hard scientific

evidence therefore seemed to confirm women's anecdotal reports.<p>



<p>



Men more often than women undergo angiographies and

coronary-artery-bypass-graft operations. Even though heart disease is the No. 1

killer of women as well as men, this sophisticated, state-of-the-art

technology, critics contend, is selectively denied to women.<p>



<p>



The problem is said to be repeated in medical research: women, critics argue,

are routinely ignored in favor of men. When the NIH inventoried all the

research it had funded in 1987, the money spent on studying diseases unique to

women amounted to only 13.5 percent of the total research budget.<p>



<p>



Perhaps the most emotionally charged disease for women is breast cancer. If a

tumor devastated men on a similar scale, critics say, we would declare a state

of national emergency and launch a no-cost-barred Apollo Project-style program

to cure it. In the words of Matilda Cuomo, the wife of the governor of New

York, "If we can send a woman to the moon, we can surely find a cure for breast

cancer." The neglect of breast-cancer research, we have been told, is both

sexist and a national disgrace.<p>



<p>



Nearly all heart-disease research is said to be conducted on men, with the

conclusions blindly generalized to women. In July of 1989 researchers from the

Harvard Medical School reported the results of a five-year study on the effects

of aspirin in preventing cardiovascular disease in 22,071 male physicians.

Thousands of men were studied, but not one woman: women's health, critics

charge, was obviously not considered important enough to explore similarly.

Here, they say, we have definite, smoking-gun evidence of the neglect of women

in medical research--only one example of a widespread, dangerous phenomenon.<p>



<p>



Still another difference: pharmaceutical companies make a policy of giving new

drugs to men first, while women wait to benefit from the advances. And even

then the medicines are often inadequately tested on women.<p>



<p>



To remedy all this neglect, we need to devote preferential attention and funds,

in the words of the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association, to

"the greatest resource this country will ever have, namely, the health of its

women." Discrimination on such a large scale cries out for restitution--if the

charges are true.<p>



<p>



In fact one sex does appear to be favored in the amount of attention devoted to

its medical needs. In the United States it is estimated that one sex spends

twice as much money on health care as the other does. The NIH also spends twice

as much money on research into the diseases specific to one sex as it does on

research into those specific to the other, and only one sex has a section of

the NIH devoted entirely to the study of diseases afflicting it. That sex is

not men, however. It is women.<p>



<p><br>



<font size=5>I</font>N the United States women seek out and consequently receive more medical care

than men. This is true even if pregnancy-related care is excluded. Department

of Health and Human Services surveys show that women visit doctors more often

than men, are hospitalized more often, and undergo more operations. Women are

more likely than men to visit a doctor for a general physical exam when they

are feeling well, and complain of symptoms more often. Thus two out of every

three health-care dollars are spent by women.<p>



<p>



Quantity, of course, does not guarantee quality. Do women receive second-rate

diagnostic workups?<p>



<p>



The 1979 San Diego study, which concluded that men's complaints more often led

to extensive workups than did women's, used the charts of 104 men and women

(fifty-two married couples) as data. This small-scale regional survey prompted

a more extensive national review of 46,868 office visits. The results, reported

in 1981, were quite different from those of the San Diego study.<p>



<p>



In this larger, more representative sample, the care received by men and women

was similar about two thirds of the time. When the care was different, women

overall received more diagnostic tests and treatment--more lab tests,

blood-pressure checks, drug prescriptions, and return appointments.<p>



<p>



Several other, small-scale studies have weighed in on both sides of this issue.

The San Diego researchers looked at another 200 men and women in 1984, and this

time found "no significant differences in the extent and content" of workups.

Some women's-health-care advocates have chosen to ignore data from the second

San Diego study and the national survey while touting the first study as

evidence that doctors, to quote once again from the Journal of the American

Medical Women's Association, do "not take complaints as seriously" when they

come from women: "an example of a double standard influencing diagnostic

workups."<p>



<p>



When prescribing care for heart disease, doctors consider such factors as age,

other medical problems, and the likelihood that the patient will benefit from

testing and surgery. Coronary-artery disease afflicts men at a much younger

age, killing them three times as often as women until age sixty-five. Younger

patients have fewer additional medical problems that preclude aggressive,

high-risk procedures. And smaller patients have smaller coronary arteries,

which become obstructed more often after surgery. Whereas this is true for both

sexes, obviously more women fit into the smaller-patient category. When these

differences are factored in, sex divergence in cardiac care begins to fade

away.<p>



<p>



To the extent that divergence remains, women may be getting better treatment.

At least that was the conclusion of a University of North Carolina/Duke

University study that looked at the records of 5,795 patients treated from 1969

to 1984. The most symptomatic and severely diseased men and women were equally

likely to be referred for bypass surgery. Among the patients with less-severe

disease--the ones to whom surgery offers little or no survival benefit over

medical therapy--women were less likely to be scheduled for bypass surgery.

This seems proper in light of the greater risk of surgical complications, owing

to women's smaller coronary arteries. In fact, the researchers questioned the

wisdom of surgery in the less symptomatic men and suggested that "the effect of

gender on treatment selection may have led to more appropriate treatment of

women."<p>



<p>



As for sophisticated, pioneering technology selectively designed for the

benefit of one sex, laparoscopic surgery was largely confined to gynecology for

more than twenty years. Using viewing and manipulating instruments that can be

inserted into the abdomen through keyhole-sized incisions, doctors are able to

diagnose and repair, sparing the patient a larger incision and a longer, more

painful recuperation. Laparoscopic tubal sterilization, first performed in

1936, became common practice in the late 1960s. Over time the development of

more-versatile instruments and of fiber-optic video capability made possible

the performance of more-complex operations. The laparoscopic removal of ectopic

pregnancy was reported in 1973. Finally, in 1987, the same technology was

applied in gallbladder surgery, and men began to enjoy its benefits too.<p>



<p>



Years after ultrasound instruments were designed to look inside the uterus, the

same technology was adapted to search for tumors in the prostate. Other

pioneering developments conceived to improve the health care of women include

mammography, bone-density testing for osteoporosis, surgery to alleviate

bladder incontinence, hormone therapy to relieve the symptoms of menopause, and

a host of procedures, including in vitro fertilization, developed to facilitate

impregnation. Perhaps so many new developments occur in women's health care

because one branch of medicine and a group of doctors, gynecologists, are

explicitly concerned with the health of women. No corresponding group of

doctors is dedicated to the care of men.<p>



<p>



So women receive more care than men, sometimes receive better care than men,

and benefit more than men do from some developing technologies. This hardly

looks like proof that women's health is viewed as secondary in importance to

men's health.<p>



<p><br>



<font size=5>T</font>HE 1987 NIH inventory did indeed find that only 13.5 percent of the NIH

research budget was devoted to studying diseases unique to women. But 80

percent of the budget went into research for the benefit of both sexes,

including basic research in fields such as genetics and immunology and also

research into diseases such as lymphoma, arthritis, and sickle-cell anemia.

Both men and women suffer from these ailments, and both sexes served as study

subjects. The remaining 6.5 percent of NIH research funds were devoted to

afflictions unique to men. Oddly, the women's 13.5 percent has been cited as

evidence of neglect. The much smaller men's share of the budget is rarely

mentioned in these references.<p>



<p>



As for breast cancer, the second most lethal malignancy in females,

investigation in that field has long received more funding from the National

Cancer Institute than any other tumor research, though lung cancer heads the

list of fatal tumors for both sexes. The second most lethal malignancy in males

is also a sex-specific tumor: prostate cancer. Last year approximately 46,000

women succumbed to breast cancer and 35,000 men to prostate cancer; the NCI

spent $213.7 million on breast-cancer research and $51.1 million on study of

the prostate. Thus although about a third more women died of breast cancer than

men of prostate cancer, breast-cancer research received more than four times

the funding. More than three times as much money per fatality was spent on the

women's disease. Breast cancer accounted for 8.8 percent of cancer fatalities

in the United States and for 13 percent of the NCI research budget; the

corresponding figures for prostate cancer were 6.7 percent of fatalities and

three percent of the funding. The spending for breast-cancer research is

projected to increase by 23 percent this year, to $262.9 million;

prostate-research spending will increase by 7.6 percent, to $55 million.<p>



<p>



The female cancers of the cervix and the uterus accounted for 10,100 deaths and

$48.5 million in research last year, and ovarian cancer accounted for 13,300

deaths and $32.5 million in research. Thus the research funding for all

female-specific cancers is substantially larger per fatality than the funding

for prostate cancer.<p>



<p>



Is this level of spending on women's health just a recent development, needed

to make up for years of prior neglect? The NCI is divided into sections dealing

with issues such as cancer biology and diagnosis, prevention and control,

etiology, and treatment. Until funding allocations for sex-specific concerns

became a political issue, in the mid-1980s, the NCI did not track

organ-specific spending data. The earliest information now available was

reconstructed retroactively to 1981. Nevertheless, these early data provide a

window on spending patterns in the era before political pressure began to

intensify for more research on women. Each year from 1981 to 1985 funding for

breast-cancer research exceeded funding for prostate cancer by a ratio of

roughly five to one. A rational, nonpolitical explanation for this is that

breast cancer attacks a larger number of patients, at a younger age. In any

event, the data fail to support claims that women were neglected in that era.<p>



<p>



Again, most medical research is conducted on diseases that afflict both sexes.

Women's-health advocates charge that we collect data from studies of men and

then extrapolate to women. A look at the actual data reveals a different

reality.<p>



<p>



The best-known and most ambitious study of cardiovascular health over time

began in the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, in 1948. Researchers started

with 2,336 men and 2,873 women aged thirty to sixty-two, and have followed the

survivors of this group with biennial physical exams and lab tests for more

than forty-five years. In this and many other observational studies women have

been well represented.<p>



<p>



With respect to the aspirin study, the researchers at Harvard Medical School

did not focus exclusively on men. Both sexes were studied nearly concurrently.

The men's study was more rigorous, because it was placebo-controlled (that is,

some subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebos instead of aspirin);

the women's study was based on responses to questionnaires sent to nurses and a

review of medical records. The women's study, however, followed nearly four

times as many subjects as the men's study (87,678 versus 22,071), and it

followed its subjects for a year longer (six versus five) than the men's study

did. The results of the men's study were reported in the New England Journal of

Medicine in July of 1989 and prompted charges of sexism in medical research.

The women's-study results were printed in the Journal of the American Medical

Association in July of 1991, and were generally ignored by the nonmedical

press.<p>



<p>



Most studies on the prevention of "premature" (occurring in people under age

sixty-five) coronary-artery disease have, in fact, been conducted on men. Since

middle-aged women have a much lower incidence of this illness than their male

counterparts (they provide less than a third as many cases), documenting the

preventive effect of a given treatment in these women is much more difficult.

More experiments were conducted on men not because women were considered less

important but because women suffer less from this disease. Older women do

develop coronary disease (albeit at a lower rate than older men), but the

experiments were not performed on older men either. At most the data suggest an

emphasis on the prevention of disease in younger people.<p>



<p>



Incidentally, all clinical breast-cancer research currently funded by the NCI

is being conducted on women, even though 300 men a year die of this tumor. Do

studies on the prevention of breast cancer which specifically exclude males

signify a neglect of men's health? Or should a disease be studied in the group

most at risk? Obviously, the coronary-disease research situation and the

breast-cancer research situation are not equivalent, but together they do serve

to illustrate a point: diseases are most often studied in the highest-risk

group, regardless of sex.<p>



<p>



What about all the new drug tests that exclude women? Don't they prove the

pharmaceutical industry's insensitivity to and disregard for females?<p>



<p>



The Food and Drug Administration divides human testing of new medicines into

three stages. Phase 1 studies are done on a small number of volunteers over a

brief period of time, primarily to test safety. Phase 2 studies typically

involve a few hundred patients and are designed to look more closely at safety

and effectiveness. Phase 3 tests precede approval for commercial release and

generally include several thousand patients.<p>



<p>



In 1977 the FDA issued guidelines that specifically excluded women with

"childbearing potential" from phase 1 and early phase 2 studies; they were to

be included in late phase 2 and phase 3 trials in proportion to their expected

use of the medication. FDA surveys conducted in 1983 and 1988 showed that the

two sexes had been proportionally represented in clinical trials by the time

drugs were approved for release.<p>



<p>



The 1977 guidelines codified a policy already informally in effect since the

thalidomide tragedy shocked the world in 1962. The births of armless or

otherwise deformed babies in that era dramatically highlighted the special

risks incurred when fertile women ingest drugs. So the policy of excluding such

women from the early phases of drug testing arose out of concern, not out of

disregard, for them. The policy was changed last year, as a consequence of

political protest and recognition that early studies in both sexes might better

direct testing.<p>



<p><br>



<font size=5>T</font>HROUGHOUT human history from antiquity until the beginning of this century

men, on the average, lived slightly longer than women. By 1920 women's life

expectancy in the United States was one year greater than men's (54.6 years

versus 53.6). After that the gap increased steadily, to 3.5 years in 1930, 4.4

years in 1940, 5.5 in 1950, 6.5 in 1960, and 7.7 in 1970. For the past quarter

of a century the gap has remained relatively steady: around seven years. In

1990 the figure was seven years (78.8 versus 71.8).<p>



<p>



Thus in the latter part of the twentieth century women live about 10 percent

longer than men. A significant part of the reason for this is medical care.<p>



<p>



In past centuries complications during childbirth were a major cause of

traumatic death in women. Medical advances have dramatically eliminated most of

this risk. Infections such as smallpox, cholera, and tuberculosis killed large

numbers of men and women at similar ages. The elimination of infection as the

dominant cause of death has boosted the prominence of diseases that selectively

afflict men earlier in life.<p>



<p>



Age-adjusted mortality rates for men are higher for all twelve leading causes

of death, including heart disease, stroke, cancer, lung disease (emphysema and

pneumonia), liver disease (cirrhosis), suicide, and homicide. We have come to

accept women's longer life span as natural, the consequence of their greater

biological fitness. Yet this greater fitness never manifested itself in all the

millennia of human history that preceded the present era and its medical-care

system--the same system that women's-health advocates accuse of neglecting the

female sex.<p>



<p>



To remedy the alleged neglect, an Office of Research on Women's Health was

established by the NIH in 1990. In 1991 the NIH launched its largest

epidemiological project ever, the Women's Health Initiative. Costing more than

$600 million, this fifteen-year program will study the effects of estrogen

therapy, diet, dietary supplements, and exercise on heart disease, breast

cancer, colon cancer, osteoporosis, and other diseases in 160,000

postmenopausal women. The study is ambitious in scope and may well result in

many advances in the care of older women.<p>



<p>



What it will not do is close the "medical gender gap," the difference in the

quality of care given the two sexes. The reason is that the gap does not favor

men. As we have seen, women receive more medical care and benefit more from

medical research. The net result is the most important gap of all: seven years,

10 percent of life.<p>

HOMFELD graduated from the University of California at SantaBarbara and took his master's degree and his doctorate in education atStanford. He has taught in grade school and in college, has served as principalof a junior high school, and since 1947 has been superintendent of Menlo Parkcity school district.</i></font><p>			<pre>		</pre>		<font size=5>T</font>here are signs today that the school has become society's dumping ground, thatthe public school system has become a vast refuse heap for any and everyunwanted service or task that other social or governmental institutions andagencies find too tough to handle. The community, the home, and to some extenteven the church have used the public schools to relieve their consciences offeelings of guilt by passing on unfinished business which they have founddifficult of accomplishment or just burdensome.<p><p>Can we expect to go on and on in this ever-expanding program, one in whichpublic educators attempt to do all things for all people and do them well? Canwe do everything for everybody? If not, by what criterion shall we select thosethings which we can do, and how shall we say no?<p><p>The first half of the twentieth century has seen an almost completemetamorphosis of the institution which we call the public school. The grammarschool of 1900, which has now become the elementary school, offered as itscurriculum reading, writing, spelling, grammar, and numbers, and a few veryadventurous souls were teaching some history and geography. The typical highschool curriculum consisted of more mathematics, history, a concentrated studyof the English language and its literature, and, of course, Latin. Some of themore daring secondary schools were permitting the teaching of German andFrench, but such frills were generally reserved for girls' finishing schools orfor university study in preparation for advanced research. <p><p>Now, to be sure, I have no intention of recommending that we go back to 1900. Iam not damning any of the changes that have taken place during the last fiftyyears. I do say that it is time for us to take stock. It is time to look atwhat we have done to our schools.<p><p>Law enforcement agencies, highway engineers, automobile designers andmanufacturers, and traffic experts have created or permitted to be created aseemingly insoluble problem of mass murder and mayhem on our highways. Whensociety wanted to find a solution, it turned to the public schools and said,"Here, how about teaching us to drive safely? We haven't been able to teachourselves." And so driver education is a standard course of study for ouryoungsters.<p><p>When the good people in our society found themselves faced with an ever-risingdivorce rate and increasing percentages of illegitimate births, and unable todo much about it, they turned to the public schools and said, "Please won't youteach our children family responsibility, how to become good parents, knowledgeof sex and reproduction, how to select a mate, and how to act on a date?" andso more frill courses were added to the curriculum.<p><p>I am reminded of an incident related to me by Mrs. Homfeld concerning aninterruption of an afternoon ladies' bridge party at the home of one of ourneighbors. The front door of the living room opened with a swish and closedwith a bang, and there stood the pride and joy of the household--a teen-agedaughter. Her hair flying, her cashmere sweater pulled askew, her skirt turnedhalfway round on her hips, and a wad of gum keeping her jaws noisily working,our heroine looked neither right nor left, but strode diagonally past half adozen tables of bridge players to the grand piano, where she reached into ahuge cluster of hors d'oeuvres, gathered together as many of the tidbits as shecould, and then marched out of the room through a door at the other corner. Thehostess giggled nervously and remarked, "And that is the kind of manners theyteach our kids in high school."<p><p>When employers of young people found the apprentice system and in-servicetraining of workers to be a difficult and expensive task, they turned to theschools and said, "Here, you can easily equip yourselves to teach carpentry, ordrafting, or plumbing, or sheet-metal work, or electricity, or typing, orbookkeeping, or any one of a hundred other things. You do it."<p><p>When the young American housewife decided to live beyond her husband's means,when Mama went to work and Grandma rebelled at the idea of taking over fullresponsibility for the children, the young couple brought pressure on our statelegislators to establish child care centers, and again the public school wasselected as the agency to carry out the job.<p><p>A task even more difficult than any of these is being slowly pushed on theschool: correcting emotional and social shortcomings of children. Many schoolstoday are including on their staffs dental hygienists who in fact aretherapists, social welfare workers who are in fact social therapists,psychologists and psychiatrists who are in fact mental therapists, and evenmedical doctors to help not in the physical education of children but in thetherapy which might lead to the correction of physical deficiencies.<p><p>And surely school people are not without blame. We of the profession ofeducation have had a strong tendency to welcome with open arms any and everynew task offered us. But I believe a time of reckoning is at hand. Not onlymust we soon come forward with an answer to the question, "What shall weteach?" but I believe we must also consider seriously the query, "Can we teacheveryone?"<p><p>I cite the instance of the tragic death of a junior high school principal inNew York last autumn. In frustration over his inability to curb the misbehaviorof a small minority of his student body, he ended it all by throwing himselffrom the roof of his own school building. I raise the question, "Was hisproblem one of public education, or was it rather one of society at large?"Where is that small minority of children now? Within a few hours following hisdeath, they were permanently expelled along with some six hundred otherincorrigibles from the schools of New York, not because they could not learnbut because they were not physically and emotionally willing to conform tominimum standards. For years the teachers and administrators of New Yorkschools had struggled with this incorrigible minority on the basis that if theykicked them out, there was no place for them to go. The question I raise is,"Is it the school's responsibility, or is it the responsibility of society atlarge?"<p><p>Of a less dramatic but equally serious nature is the problem of the childrenwho are so emotionally disturbed that they become a burden on the teacher andon the other children in their classes. Over and over I have seen teachers andprincipals resist the removal of such children from class on no more soundgrounds than that "the child is better off in school than at home or runningthe streets." Or take the case of the child of irresponsible parents who issent to school improperly fed or rested or clothed, or just plain dirty. Thetendency of teachers is to struggle somehow with the problem--find food or findclothes or provide an opportunity for rest, or all three.<p><p>Can the role of public education include the responsibility for the physical,social, emotional, and spiritual as well as academic instruction of children,or might some of these be handled better by other institutions? Should itinclude the preparation of children for marriage and parenthood, or might otherinstitutions or persons do this job as well or better? Should the schools takethe responsibility for children's activities from dawn to dusk in order to curbjuvenile delinquency, or might we better look to other agencies to acceptresponsibility for part of this day? Should we say yes to every pressure groupthat wants to add one more frill course to our curriculum, or should we say,"No, our job is thus and so. Some other agency must be made responsible forthat."<p><p>The state of California requires its elementary schools to teach nineteensubjects. They include the nature of tobacco, the nature of alcohol, trainingfor healthful living, morals, manners, safety, fire prevention, physicaleducation, conservation of natural resources, art, music, history ofCalifornia, civics, the commemoration of Bird Day, Arbor Day, Luther BurbankDay, and Susan B. Anthony Day. Most local boards of education also requireelementary schools to teach craft courses, instrumental music, woodworking,sewing, cooking, and a variety of other subjects. Each schoolhouse and plantmust also be maintained and operated as a community center for recreation andcivic activities for both young and old. And then, of course, we have to teachreading, writing, arithmetic, spelling, geography, history, and language aswell. <p><p>Most high schools are required either by law or by the pressure of thecommunities in which they operate to offer one hundred or more subjects, andmost of these subjects must be offered on two or three levels of difficulty.<p><p>Changes are coming in the schools. There can be no doubt of this. I can namesome of them for you. We are going to group children more and more forinstruction. Curriculums are going to include more academic subject matter. Theschool year is going to be longer. We are going to eliminate some things fromthe curriculum, and federal aid to education will doubtless become a pattern.<p><p>We here in our own little school district have tended to resist the inroads ofwhat I choose to call "doubtful school tasks." Essentially our schools areacademic in nature. We do not pretend to cure anyone's ills or correct theirphysical, mental, or emotional deficiencies. We do not offer therapy of anykind. We try not to take on the responsibilities that should be met by parents,churches, or other professions and institutions.<p><p>Believe me, I am not sure that we are right. If I were to poll the adultpopulation of my school district to get the reaction to the question, "What doyou think of the oversized, overpowered, high styled, chrome-plated, 1959products of the automotive industry?" there is no doubt that I would get anoverwhelming response favoring less flashy, more conservative, less expensivecars. And yet 75 per cent or more of the people buy the biggest, most powerful,most glittering automobile. Is their evaluation of education in the same vein?Do they give lip service to one kind of education but really want another?<p><p>Let's all look at our school system and identify for ourselves, for ouradministrators, for our board of education, and for the community the spotswhere we duplicate services which are or should be offered by other agencies.Let's stop duplicating services. The schools should set goals that areattainable and should not overcommit their ability to serve. Let them refuse toaccept responsibilities which are beyond their capabilities and refuse toundertake so many duties that none is thoroughly performed.	</blockquote><hr><pre></pre><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a><a href="http://vws.agtnet.com/atl_find.html"><img src="../../../images/bt-find.gif" width=61 height=23 border=0 alt="Search"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1959 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

<blockquote>

	

	<font size=5>A</font>MERICAN POETRY now belongs to a subculture. No longer part of the mainstream

of artistic and intellectual life, it has become the specialized occupation of

a relatively small and isolated group. Little of the frenetic activity it

generates ever reaches outside that closed group. As a class poets are not

without cultural status. Like priests in a town of agnostics, they still

command a certain residual prestige. But as individual artists they are almost

invisible.<p>







What makes the situation of contemporary poets particularly surprising is that

it comes at a moment of unprecedented expansion for the art. There have never

before been so many new books of poetry published, so many anthologies or

literary magazines. Never has it been so easy to earn a living as a poet. There

are now several thousand college-level jobs in teaching creative writing, and

many more at the primary and secondary levels. Congress has even instituted the

position of poet laureate, as have twenty-five states. One also finds a complex

network of public subvention for poets, funded by federal, state, and local

agencies, augmented by private support in the form of foundation fellowships,

prizes, and subsidized retreats. There has also never before been so much

published criticism about contemporary poetry; it fills dozens of literary

newsletters and scholarly journals.<p>







The proliferation of new poetry and poetry programs is astounding by any

historical measure. Just under a thousand new collections of verse are

published each year, in addition to a myriad of new poems printed in magazines

both small and large. No one knows how many poetry readings take place each

year, but surely the total must run into the tens of thousands. And there are

now about 200 graduate creative-writing programs in the United States, and more

than a thousand undergraduate ones. With an average of ten poetry students in

each graduate section, these programs alone will produce about 20,000

accredited professional poets over the next decade. From such statistics an

observer might easily conclude that we live in the golden age of American

poetry.<p>







But the poetry boom has been a distressingly confined phenomenon. Decades of

public and private funding have created a large professional class for the

production and reception of new poetry comprising legions of teachers, graduate

students, editors, publishers, and administrators. Based mostly in

universities, these groups have gradually become the primary audience for

contemporary verse. Consequently, the energy of American poetry, which was once

directed outward, is now increasingly focused inward. Reputations are made and

rewards distributed within the poetry subculture. To adapt Russell Jacoby's

definition of contemporary academic renown from <I>The Last Intellectuals</I>, a

"famous" poet now means someone famous only to other poets. But there are

enough poets to make that local fame relatively meaningful. Not long ago, "only

poets read poetry" was meant as damning criticism. Now it is a proven marketing

strategy.<p>







The situation has become a paradox, a Zen riddle of cultural sociology. Over

the past half century, as American poetry's specialist audience has steadily

expanded, its general readership has declined. Moreover, the engines that have

driven poetry's institutional success--the explosion of academic writing

programs, the proliferation of subsidized magazines and presses, the emergence

of a creative-writing career track, and the migration of American literary

culture to the university--have unwittingly contributed to its disappearance

from public view.<p>



<BR>

<BR>



<font size=4><b>Its Own World</b></font><p>







<font size=5>T</font>O the average reader, the proposition that poetry's audience has declined may

seem self-evident. It is symptomatic of the art's current isolation that within

the subculture such notions are often rejected. Like chamber-of-commerce

representatives from Parnassus, poetry boosters offer impressive recitations of

the numerical growth of publications, programs, and professorships. Given the

bullish statistics on poetry's material expansion, how does one demonstrate

that its intellectual and spiritual influence has eroded? One cannot easily

marshal numbers, but to any candid observer the evidence throughout the world

of ideas and letters seems inescapable.<p>





Daily newspapers no longer review poetry. There is, in fact, little coverage of

poetry or poets in the general press. From 1984 until this year the National

Book Awards dropped poetry as a category. Leading critics rarely review it. In

fact, virtually no one reviews it except other poets. Almost no popular

collections of contemporary poetry are available except those, like the <I>Norton

Anthology</I>, targeting an academic audience. It seems, in short, as if the large

audience that still exists for quality fiction hardly notices poetry. A reader

familiar with the novels of Joyce Carol Oates, John Updike, or John Barth may

not even recognize the names of Gwendolyn Brooks, Gary Snyder, and W. D.

Snodgrass.<p>





One can see a microcosm of poetry's current position by studying its coverage

in <I>The New York Times</I>. Virtually never reviewed in the daily edition, new

poetry is intermittently discussed in the Sunday <I>Book Review</I>, but almost

always in group reviews where three books are briefly considered together.

Whereas a new novel or biography is reviewed on or around its publication date,

a new collection by an important poet like Donald Hall or David Ignatow might

wait up to a year for a notice. Or it might never be reviewed at all. Henry

Taylor's <I>The Flying Change</I> was reviewed only after it had won the Pulitzer

Prize. Rodney Jones's <I>Transparent Gestures</I> was reviewed months after it had won

the National Book Critics Circle Award. Rita Dove's Pulitzer Prize-winning

<I>Thomas and Beulah</I> was not reviewed by the <I>Times</I> at all.<p>





Poetry reviewing is no better anywhere else, and generally it is much worse.

<I>The New York Times</I> only reflects the opinion that although there is a great

deal of poetry around, none of it matters very much to readers, publishers, or

advertisers--to anyone, that is, except other poets. For most newspapers and

magazines, poetry has become a literary commodity intended less to be read than

to be noted with approval. Most editors run poems and poetry reviews the way a

prosperous Montana rancher might keep a few buffalo around--not to eat the

endangered creatures but to display them for tradition's sake.<p>



<BR>

<BR>



<font size=4><b>How Poetry Diminished</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>A</font>RGUMENTS about the decline of poetry's cultural importance are not new. In

American letters they date back to the nineteenth century. But the modern

debate might be said to have begun in 1934 when Edmund Wilson published the

first version of his controversial essay "Is Verse a Dying Technique?"

Surveying literary history, Wilson noted that verse's role had grown

increasingly narrow since the eighteenth century. In particular, Romanticism's

emphasis on intensity made poetry seem so "fleeting and quintessential" that

eventually it dwindled into a mainly lyric medium. As verse--which had

previously been a popular medium for narrative, satire, drama, even history and

scientific speculation--retreated into lyric, prose usurped much of its

cultural territory. Truly ambitious writers eventually had no choice but to

write in prose. The future of great literature, Wilson speculated, belonged

almost entirely to prose.<p>





Wilson was a capable analyst of literary trends. His skeptical assessment of

poetry's place in modern letters has been frequently attacked and qualified

over the past half century, but it has never been convincingly dismissed. His

argument set the ground rules for all subsequent defenders of contemporary

poetry. It also provided the starting point for later iconoclasts, from Delmore

Schwartz to Christopher Clausen. The most recent and celebrated of these

revisionists is Joseph Epstein, whose mordant 1988 critique "Who Killed

Poetry?" first appeared in <I>Commentary</I> and was reprinted in an extravagantly

acrimonious symposium in <I>AWP Chronicle</I> (the journal of the Associated Writing

Programs). Not coincidentally, Epstein's title pays a double homage to Wilson's

essay--first by mimicking the interrogative form of the original title, second

by employing its metaphor of death.<p>





Epstein essentially updated Wilson's argument, but with important differences.

Whereas Wilson looked on the decline of poetry's cultural position as a gradual

process spanning three centuries, Epstein focused on the past few decades. He

contrasted the major achievements of the modernists--the generation of Eliot

and Stevens, which led poetry from moribund Romanticism into the twentieth

century--with what he felt were the minor accomplishments of the present

practitioners. The modernists, Epstein maintained, were artists who worked from

a broad cultural vision. Contemporary writers were "poetry professionals," who

operated within the closed world of the university. Wilson blamed poetry's

plight on historical forces; Epstein indicted the poets themselves and the

institutions they had helped create, especially creative-writing programs. A

brilliant polemicist, Epstein intended his essay to be incendiary, and it did

ignite an explosion of criticism. No recent essay on American poetry has

generated so many immediate responses in literary journals. And certainly none

has drawn so much violently negative criticism from poets themselves. To date

at least thirty writers have responded in print. The poet Henry Taylor

published two rebuttals.<p>





Poets are justifiably sensitive to arguments that poetry has declined in

cultural importance, because journalists and reviewers have used such arguments

simplistically to declare all contemporary verse irrelevant. Usually the less a

critic knows about verse the more readily he or she dismisses it. It is no

coincidence, I think, that the two most persuasive essays on poetry's presumed

demise were written by outstanding critics of fiction, neither of whom has

written extensively about contemporary poetry. It is too soon to judge the

accuracy of Epstein's essay, but a literary historian would find Wilson's

timing ironic. As Wilson finished his famous essay, Robert Frost, Wallace

Stevens, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, E. E. Cummings, Robinson

Jeffers, H. D. (Hilda Doolittle), Robert Graves, W. H. Auden, Archibald

MacLeish, Basil Bunting, and others were writing some of their finest poems,

which, encompassing history, politics, economics, religion, and philosophy, are

among the most culturally inclusive in the history of the language. At the same

time, a new generation, which would include Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop,

Philip Larkin, Randall Jarrell, Dylan Thomas, A. D. Hope, and others, was just

breaking into print. Wilson himself later admitted that the emergence of a

versatile and ambitious poet like Auden contradicted several points of his

argument. But if Wilson's prophecies were sometimes inaccurate, his sense of

poetry's overall situation was depressingly astute. Even if great poetry

continues to be written, it has retreated from the center of literary life.

Though supported by a loyal coterie, poetry has lost the confidence that it

speaks to and for the general culture.<p>



<BR>

<BR>



<font size=4><b>Inside the Subculture</b></font><p>







<font size=5>O</font>NE sees evidence of poetry's diminished stature even within the thriving

subculture. The established rituals of the poetry world--the readings, small

magazines, workshops, and conferences--exhibit a surprising number of

self-imposed limitations. Why, for example, does poetry mix so seldom with

music, dance, or theater? At most readings the program consists of verse

only--and usually only verse by that night's author. Forty years ago, when

Dylan Thomas read, he spent half the program reciting other poets' work. Hardly

a self-effacing man, he was nevertheless humble before his art. Today most

readings are celebrations less of poetry than of the author's ego. No wonder

the audience for such events usually consists entirely of poets, would-be

poets, and friends of the author.<p>





Several dozen journals now exist that print only verse. They don't publish

literary reviews, just page after page of freshly minted poems. The heart sinks

to see so many poems crammed so tightly together, like downcast immigrants in

steerage. One can easily miss a radiant poem amid the many lackluster ones. It

takes tremendous effort to read these small magazines with openness and

attention. Few people bother, generally not even the magazines' contributors.

The indifference to poetry in the mass media has created a monster of the

opposite kind--journals that love poetry not wisely but too well.<p>





Until about thirty years ago most poetry appeared in magazines that addressed a

nonspecialist audience on a range of subjects. Poetry vied for the reader's

interest along with politics, humor, fiction, and reviews--a competition that

proved healthy for all the genres. A poem that didn't command the reader's

attention wasn't considered much of a poem. Editors chose verse that they felt

would appeal to their particular audiences, and the diversity of magazines

assured that a variety of poetry appeared. The early <I>Kenyon Review</I> published

Robert Lowell's poems next to critical essays and literary reviews. The old <I>New

Yorker</I> celebrated Ogden Nash between cartoons and short stories.<p>





A few general-interest magazines, such as <I>The New Republic</I> and 

<I>The New Yorker</I>, still publish poetry in every issue, but, 

significantly, none except <I>The Nation</I> still reviews it regularly.  

Some poetry appears in the handful of small magazines and quarterlies that 

consistently discuss a broad cultural agenda with nonspecialist readers, 

such as <I>The Threepenny Review</I>, <I>The New Criterion</I>, and <I>The 

Hudson Review</I>.  But most poetry is published in journals that address 

an insular audience of literary professionals, mainly teachers of creative 

writing and their students.  A few of these, such as <I>American Poetry Review</I> 

and <I>AWP Chronicle</I>, have moderately large circulations.  Many more have 

negligible readerships.  But size is not the problem.  The problem is their 

complacency or resignation about existing only in and for a subculture.<p>





What are the characteristics of a poetry-subculture publication? First, the one

subject it addresses is current American literature (supplemented perhaps by a

few translations of poets who have already been widely translated). Second, if

it prints anything other than poetry, that is usually short fiction. Third, if

it runs discursive prose, the essays and reviews are overwhelmingly positive.

If it publishes an interview, the tone will be unabashedly reverent toward the

author. For these journals critical prose exists not to provide a disinterested

perspective on new books but to publicize them. Quite often there are manifest

personal connections between the reviewers and the authors they discuss. If

occasionally a negative review is published, it will be openly sectarian,

rejecting an aesthetic that the magazine has already condemned. The unspoken

editorial rule seems to be, Never surprise or annoy the readers; they are,

after all, mainly our friends and colleagues.<p>





By abandoning the hard work of evaluation, the poetry subculture demeans its

own art. Since there are too many new poetry collections appearing each year

for anyone to evaluate, the reader must rely on the candor and discernment of

reviewers to recommend the best books. But the general press has largely

abandoned this task, and the specialized press has grown so overprotective of

poetry that it is reluctant to make harsh judgments. In his new book, <I>American

Poetry: Wildness and Domesticity</I>, Robert Bly has accurately described the

corrosive effect of this critical boosterism:<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

We have an odd situation: although more bad poetry is being published now than

ever before in American history, most of the reviews are positive. Critics say,

"I never attack what is bad, all that will take care of itself," . . . but the

country is full of young poets and readers who are confused by seeing mediocre

poetry praised, or never attacked, and who end up doubting their own critical

perceptions.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>











A clubby feeling also typifies most recent anthologies of contemporary poetry.

Although these collections represent themselves as trustworthy guides to the

best new poetry, they are not compiled for readers outside the academy. More

than one editor has discovered that the best way to get an anthology assigned

is to include work by the poets who teach the courses. Compiled in the spirit

of congenial opportunism, many of these anthologies give the impression that

literary quality is a concept that neither an editor nor a reader should take

too seriously.<p>





The 1985 <I>Morrow Anthology of Younger American Poets</I>, for example, is 

not so much a selective literary collection as a comprehensive directory of 

creative-writing teachers (it even offers a photo of each author).  Running 

nearly 800 pages, the volume presents no fewer than 104 important young 

poets, virtually all of whom teach creative writing.  The editorial 

principle governing selection seems to have been the fear of leaving out 

some influential colleague.  The book does contain a few strong and 

original poems, but they are surrounded by so many undistinguished 

exercises that one wonders if the good work got there by design or simply 

by random sampling.  In the drearier patches one suspects that perhaps the 

book was never truly meant to be read, only assigned.<p>





And that is the real issue. The poetry subculture no longer assumes that all

published poems will be read. Like their colleagues in other academic

departments, poetry professionals must publish, for purposes of both job

security and career advancement. The more they publish, the faster they

progress. If they do not publish, or wait too long, their economic futures are

in grave jeopardy.<p>





In art, of course, everyone agrees that quality and not quantity matters. Some

authors survive on the basis of a single unforgettable poem--Edmund Waller's

"Go, Lovely Rose," for example, or Edwin Markham's "The Man With the Hoe,"

which was made famous by being reprinted in hundreds of newspapers--an

unthinkable occurrence today. But bureaucracies, by their very nature, have

difficulty measuring something as intangible as literary quality. When

institutions evaluate creative artists for employment or promotion, they still

must find some seemingly objective means to do so. As the critic Bruce Bawer

has observed,<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

A poem is, after all, a fragile thing, and its intrinsic worth or lack

thereof, is a frighteningly subjective consideration; but fellowship grants,

degrees, appointments, and publications are objective facts. They are

quantifiable; they can be listed on a resume.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>







Poets serious about making careers in institutions understand that the criteria

for success are primarily quantitative. They must publish as much as possible

as quickly as possible. The slow maturation of genuine creativity looks like

laziness to a committee. Wallace Stevens was forty-three when his first book

appeared. Robert Frost was thirty-nine. Today these sluggards would be

unemployable.<p>







The proliferation of literary journals and presses over the past thirty years

has been a response less to an increased appetite for poetry among the public

than to the desperate need of writing teachers for professional validation.

Like subsidized farming that grows food no one wants, a poetry industry has

been created to serve the interests of the producers and not the consumers. And

in the process the integrity of the art has been betrayed. Of course, no poet

is allowed to admit this in public. The cultural credibility of the

professional poetry establishment depends on maintaining a polite hypocrisy.

Millions of dollars in public and private funding are at stake. Luckily, no one

outside the subculture cares enough to press the point very far. No Woodward

and Bernstein will ever investigate a cover-up by members of the Associated

Writing Programs.<p>



The new poet makes a living not by publishing literary work but by providing

specialized educational services. Most likely he or she either works for or

aspires to work for a large institution--usually a state-run enterprise, such

as a school district, a college, or a university (or lately even a hospital or

prison)--teaching others how to write poetry or, on the highest levels, how to

teach others how to write poetry.<p>





To look at the issue in strictly economic terms, most contemporary poets have

been alienated from their original cultural function. As Marx maintained and

few economists have disputed, changes in a class's economic function eventually

transform its values and behavior. In poetry's case, the socioeconomic changes

have led to a divided literary culture: the superabundance of poetry within a

small class and the impoverishment outside it. One might even say that outside

the classroom--where society demands that the two groups interact--poets and

the common reader are no longer on speaking terms.<p>





The divorce of poetry from the educated reader has had another, more pernicious

result. Seeing so much mediocre verse not only published but praised, slogging

through so many dull anthologies and small magazines, most readers--even

sophisticated ones like Joseph Epstein--now assume that no significant new

poetry is being written. This public skepticism represents the final isolation

of verse as an art form in contemporary society.<p>





The irony is that this skepticism comes in a period of genuine achievement.

Gresham's Law, that bad coinage drives out good, only half applies to current

poetry. The sheer mass of mediocrity may have frightened away most readers, but

it has not yet driven talented writers from the field. Anyone patient enough to

weed through the tangle of contemporary work finds an impressive and diverse

range of new poetry. Adrienne Rich, for example, despite her often overbearing

polemics, is a major poet by any standard. The best work of Donald Justice,

Anthony Hecht, Donald Hall, James Merrill, Louis Simpson, William Stafford, and

Richard Wilbur--to mention only writers of the older generation--can hold its

own against anything in the national literature. One might also add Sylvia

Plath and James Wright, two strong poets of the same generation who died early.

America is also a country rich in emigre poetry, as major writers like Czeslaw

Milosz, Nina Cassian, Derek Walcott, Joseph Brodsky, and Thom Gunn

demonstrate.<p>





Without a role in the broader culture, however, talented poets lack the

confidence to create public speech. Occasionally a writer links up rewardingly

to a social or political movement. Rich, for example, has used feminism to

expand the vision of her work. Robert Bly wrote his finest poetry to protest

the Vietnam War. His sense of addressing a large and diverse audience added

humor, breadth, and humanity to his previously minimal verse. But it is a

difficult task to marry the Muse happily to politics. Consequently, most

contemporary poets, knowing that they are virtually invisible in the larger

culture, focus on the more intimate forms of lyric and meditative verse. (And a

few loners, like X. J. Kennedy and John Updike, turn their genius to the

critically disreputable demimonde of light verse and children's poetry.)

Therefore, although current American poetry has not often excelled in public

forms like political or satiric verse, it has nonetheless produced personal

poems of unsurpassed beauty and power. Despite its manifest excellence, this

new work has not found a public beyond the poetry subculture, because the

traditional machinery of transmission--the reliable reviewing, honest

criticism, and selective anthologies--has broken down. The audience that once

made Frost and Eliot, Cummings and Millay, part of its cultural vision remains

out of reach. Today Walt Whitman's challenge "To have great poets, there must

be great audiences, too" reads like an indictment.<p>

<font size=5>T</font>O maintain their activities, subcultures usually require institutions, since

the general society does not share their interests. Nudists flock to "nature

camps" to express their unfettered life-style. Monks remain in monasteries to

protect their austere ideals. As long as poets belonged to a broader class of

artists and intellectuals, they centered their lives in urban bohemias, where

they maintained a distrustful independence from institutions. Once poets began

moving into universities, they abandoned the working-class heterogeneity of

Greenwich Village and North Beach for the professional homogeneity of

academia.<p>



At first they existed on the fringes of English departments, which was probably

healthy. Without advanced degrees or formal career paths, poets were recognized

as special creatures. They were allowed--like aboriginal chieftains visiting an

anthropologist's campsite--to behave according to their own laws. But as the

demand for creative writing grew, the poet's job expanded from merely literary

to administrative duties. At the university's urging, these self-trained

writers designed history's first institutional curricula for young poets.

Creative writing evolved from occasional courses taught within the English

department into its own undergraduate major or graduate-degree program. Writers

fashioned their academic specialty in the image of other university studies. As

the new writing departments multiplied, the new professionals patterned their

infrastructure--job titles, journals, annual conventions,

organizations--according to the standards not of urban bohemia but of

educational institutions. Out of the professional networks this educational

expansion created, the subculture of poetry was born.<p>





Initially, the multiplication of creative-writing programs must have been a

dizzyingly happy affair. Poets who had scraped by in bohemia or had spent their

early adulthood fighting the Second World War suddenly secured stable,

well-paying jobs. Writers who had never earned much public attention found

themselves surrounded by eager students. Poets who had been too poor to travel

flew from campus to campus and from conference to conference, to speak before

audiences of their peers. As Wilfrid Sheed once described a moment in John

Berryman's career, "Through the burgeoning university network, it was suddenly

possible to think of oneself as a national poet, even if the nation turned out

to consist entirely of English Departments." The bright postwar world promised

a renaissance for American poetry.<p>





In material terms that promise has been fulfilled beyond the dreams of anyone

in Berryman's Depression-scarred generation. Poets now occupy niches at every

level of academia, from a few sumptuously endowed chairs with six-figure

salaries to the more numerous part-time stints that pay roughly the same as

Burger King. But even at minimum wage, teaching poetry earns more than writing

it ever did. Before the creative-writing boom, being a poet usually meant

living in genteel poverty or worse. While the sacrifices poetry demanded caused

much individual suffering, the rigors of serving Milton's "thankless Muse" also

delivered the collective cultural benefit of frightening away all but committed

artists.<p>





Today poetry is a modestly upwardly mobile, middle-class profession--not as

lucrative as waste management or dermatology but several big steps above the

squalor of bohemia. Only a philistine would romanticize the blissfully banished

artistic poverty of yesteryear. But a clear-eyed observer must also recognize

that by opening the poet's trade to all applicants and by employing writers to

do something other than write, institutions have changed the social and

economic identity of the poet from artist to educator. In social terms the

identification of poet with teacher is now complete. The first question one

poet now asks another upon being introduced is "Where do you teach?" The

problem is not that poets teach. The campus is not a bad place for a poet to

work. It's just a bad place for all poets to work. Society suffers by losing

the imagination and vitality that poets brought to public culture. Poetry

suffers when literary standards are forced to conform with institutional

ones.<p>





Even within the university contemporary poetry now exists as a subculture. The

teaching poet finds that he or she has little in common with academic

colleagues. The academic study of literature over the past twenty-five years

has veered off in a theoretical direction with which most imaginative writers

have little sympathy or familiarity. Thirty years ago detractors of

creative-writing programs predicted that poets in universities would become

enmeshed in literary criticism and scholarship. This prophecy has proved

spectacularly wrong. Poets have created enclaves in the academy almost entirely

separate from their critical colleagues. They write less criticism than they

did before entering the academy. Pressed to keep up with the plethora of new

poetry, small magazines, professional journals, and anthologies, they are

frequently also less well read in the literature of the past. Their peers in

the English department generally read less contemporary poetry and more

literary theory. In many departments writers and literary theorists are openly

at war. Bringing the two groups under one roof has paradoxically made each more

territorial. Isolated even within the university, the poet, whose true subject

is the whole of human existence, has reluctantly become an educational

specialist.<p>



<br>

<br>



<font size=4><b>When People Paid Attention</b></font><p>







<font size=5>T</font>O understand how radically the situation of the American poet has changed, one

need only compare today with fifty years ago. In 1940, with the notable

exception of Robert Frost, few poets were working in colleges unless, like Mark

Van Doren and Yvor Winters, they taught traditional academic subjects. The only

creative-writing program was an experiment begun a few years earlier at the

University of Iowa. The modernists exemplified the options that poets had for

making a living. They could enter middle-class professions, as had T. S. Eliot

(a banker turned publisher), Wallace Stevens (a corporate insurance lawyer) and

William Carlos Williams (a pediatrician). Or they could live in bohemia

supporting themselves as artists, as, in different ways, did Ezra Pound, E. E.

Cummings, and Marianne Moore. If the city proved unattractive, they could, like

Robinson Jeffers, scrape by in a rural arts colony like Carmel, California. Or

they might become farmers, like the young Robert Frost.<p>





Most often poets supported themselves as editors or reviewers, actively 

taking part in the artistic and intellectual life of their time.  Archibald 

MacLeish was an editor and writer at <I>Fortune</I>.  James Agee reviewed 

movies for <I>Time</I> and <I>The Nation</I>, and eventually wrote 

screenplays for Hollywood.  Randall Jarrell reviewed books.  Weldon Kees 

wrote about jazz and modern art.  Delmore Schwartz reviewed everything.  

Even poets who eventually took up academic careers spent intellectually 

broadening apprenticeships in literary journalism.  The young Robert Hayden 

covered music and theater for Michigan's black press.  R.  P.  Blackmur, 

who never completed high school, reviewed books for <I>Hound &amp; Horn</I> before 

teaching at Princeton.  Occasionally a poet might supplement his or her 

income by giving a reading or lecture, but these occasions were rare.  

Robinson Jeffers, for example, was fifty-four when he gave his first public 

reading.  For most poets, the sustaining medium was not the classroom or 

the podium but the written word.<p>





If poets supported themselves by writing, it was mainly by writing prose.

Paying outlets for poetry were limited. Beyond a few national magazines, which

generally preferred light verse or political satire, there were at any one time

only a few dozen journals that published a significant amount of poetry. The

emergence of a serious new quarterly like <I>Partisan Review</I> or <I>Furioso</I> was an

event of real importance, and a small but dedicated audience eagerly looked

forward to each issue. If people could not afford to buy copies, they borrowed

them or visited public libraries. As for books of poetry if one excludes

vanity-press editions, fewer than a hundred new titles were published each

year. But the books that did appear were reviewed in daily newspapers as well

as magazines and quarterlies. A focused monthly like <I>Poetry</I> could cover

virtually the entire field.<p>





Reviewers fifty years ago were by today's standards extraordinarily tough. They

said exactly what they thought, even about their most influential

contemporaries. Listen, for example, to Randall Jarrell's description of a book

by the famous anthologist Oscar Williams: it "gave the impression of having

been written on a typewriter by a typewriter." That remark kept Jarrell out of

subsequent Williams anthologies, but he did not hesitate to publish it. Or

consider Jarrell's assessment of Archibald MacLeish's public poem <I>America Was

Promises</I>: it "might have been devised by a YMCA secretary at a home for the

mentally deficient." Or read Weldon Kees's one-sentence review of Muriel

Rukeyser's <I>Wake Island</I>--"There's one thing you can say about Muriel: she's not

lazy." But these same reviewers could write generously about poets they

admired, as Jarrell did about Elizabeth Bishop, and Kees about Wallace Stevens.

Their praise mattered, because readers knew it did not come lightly.<p>





The reviewers of fifty years ago knew that their primary loyalty must lie not

with their fellow poets or publishers but with the reader. Consequently they

reported their reactions with scrupulous honesty even when their opinions might

lose them literary allies and writing assignments. In discussing new poetry

they addressed a wide community of educated readers. Without talking down to

their audience, they cultivated a public idiom. Prizing clarity and

accessibility they avoided specialist jargon and pedantic displays of

scholarship. They also tried, as serious intellectuals should but specialists

often do not, to relate what was happening in poetry to social, political, and

artistic trends. They charged modern poetry with cultural importance and made

it the focal point of their intellectual discourse.<p>





Ill-paid, overworked, and underappreciated, this argumentative group of

"practical" critics, all of them poets, accomplished remarkable things. They

defined the canon of modernist poetry, established methods to analyze verse of

extraordinary difficulty, and identified the new mid-century generation of

American poets (Lowell, Roethke, Bishop, Berryman, and others) that still

dominates our literary consciousness. Whatever one thinks of their literary

canon or critical principles, one must admire the intellectual energy and sheer

determination of these critics, who developed as writers without grants or

permanent faculty positions, often while working precariously on free-lance

assignments. They represent a high point in American intellectual life. Even

fifty years later their names still command more authority than those of all

but a few contemporary critics. A short roll call would include John Berryman,

R. P. Blackmur, Louise Bogan, John Ciardi, Horace Gregory, Langston Hughes,

Randall Jarrell, Weldon Kees, Kenneth Rexroth, Delmore Schwartz, Karl Shapiro,

Allen Tate, and Yvor Winters. Although contemporary poetry has its boosters and

publicists, it has no group of comparable dedication and talent able to address

the general literary community.<p>





Like all genuine intellectuals, these critics were visionary. They believed

that if modern poets did not have an audience, they could create one. And

gradually they did. It was not a mass audience; few American poets of any

period have enjoyed a direct relationship with the general public. It was a

cross-section of artists and intellectuals, including scientists, clergymen,

educators, lawyers, and, of course, writers. This group constituted a literary

intelligentsia, made up mainly of nonspecialists, who took poetry as seriously

as fiction and drama. Recently Donald Hall and other critics have questioned

the size of this audience by citing the low average sales of a volume of new

verse by an established poet during the period (usually under a thousand

copies). But these skeptics do not understand how poetry was read then.<p>





America was a smaller, less affluent country in 1940, with about half its

current population and one sixth its current real GNP. In those pre-paperback

days of the late Depression neither readers nor libraries could afford to buy

as many books as they do today. Nor was there a large captive audience of

creative-writing students who bought books of contemporary poetry for classroom

use. Readers usually bought poetry in two forms--in an occasional <I>Collected

Poems</I> by a leading author, or in anthologies. The comprehensive collections of

writers like Frost, Eliot, Auden, Jeffers, Wylie, and Millay sold very well,

were frequently reprinted, and stayed perpetually in print. (Today most

<I>Collected Poems</I> disappear after one printing.) Occasionally a book of new poems

would capture the public's fancy. Edwin Arlington Robinson's <I>Tristram</I> (1927)

became a Literary Guild selection. Frost's <I>A Further Range</I> sold 50,000 copies

as a 1936 Book-of-the-Month Club selection. But people knew poetry mainly from

anthologies, which they not only bought but also read, with curiosity and

attention.<p>





Louis Untermeyer's <I>Modern American Poetry</I>, first published in 1919, was

frequently revised to keep it up to date and was a perennial best seller. My

1942 edition, for example, had been reprinted five times by 1945. My edition of

Oscar Williams's <I>A Pocket Book of Modern Poetry</I> had been reprinted nineteen

times in fourteen years. Untermeyer and Williams prided themselves on keeping

their anthologies broad-based and timely. They tried to represent the best of

what was being published. Each edition added new poems and poets and dropped

older ones. The public appreciated their efforts. Poetry anthologies were an

indispensable part of any serious reader's library. Random House's popular

Modern Library series, for example, included not one but two

anthologies--Selden Rodman's <I>A New Anthology of Modern Poetry</I> and Conrad

Aiken's <I>Twentieth Century American Poetry</I>. All these collections were read and

reread by a diverse public. Favorite poems were memorized. Difficult authors

like Eliot and Thomas were actively discussed and debated. Poetry mattered

outside the classroom.<p>





Today these general readers constitute the audience that poetry has lost.

Limited by intelligence and curiosity this heterogeneous group cuts across

lines of race, class, age, and occupation. Representing our cultural

intelligentsia, they are the people who support the arts--who buy classical and

jazz records; who attend foreign films and serious theater, opera, symphony,

and dance; who read quality fiction and biographies; who listen to public radio

and subscribe to the best journals. (They are also often the parents who read

poetry to their children and remember, once upon a time in college or high

school or kindergarten, liking it themselves.) No one knows the size of this

community, but even if one accepts the conservative estimate that it accounts

for only two percent of the U.S. population, it still represents a potential

audience of almost five million readers. However healthy poetry may appear

within its professional subculture, it has lost this larger audience, who

represent poetry's bridge to the general culture.<p>



<br>

<br>



<font size=4><b>The Need for Poetry</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>B</font>UT why should anyone but a poet care about the problems of American poetry?

What possible relevance does this archaic art form have to contemporary

society? In a better world, poetry would need no justification beyond the sheer

splendor of its own existence. As Wallace Stevens once observed, "The purpose

of poetry is to contribute to man's happiness." Children know this essential

truth when they ask to hear their favorite nursery rhymes again and again.

Aesthetic pleasure needs no justification, because a life without such pleasure

is one not worth living.<p>





But the rest of society has mostly forgotten the value of poetry. To the

general reader, discussions about the state of poetry sound like the debating

of foreign politics by emigres in a seedy cafe. Or, as Cyril Connolly more

bitterly described it, "Poets arguing about modern poetry: jackals snarling

over a dried-up well." Anyone who hopes to broaden poetry's audience--critic,

teacher, librarian, poet, or lonely literary amateur--faces a daunting

challenge. How does one persuade justly skeptical readers, in terms they can

understand and appreciate, that poetry still matters?<p>





A passage in William Carlos Williams's "Asphodel, That Greeny Flower" provides

a possible starting point. Written toward the end of the author's life, after

he had been partly paralyzed by a stroke, the lines sum up the hard lessons

about poetry and audience that Williams had learned over years of dedication to

both poetry and medicine. He wrote,<p>





<pre>     

             My heart rouses

                    thinking to bring you news

                             of something 



             that concerns you 

                    and concerns many men. Look at 

                            what passes for the new. 

             You will not find it there but in 

                    despised poems. 

                            It is difficult 

             to get the news from poems 

                    yet men die miserably every day 

                            for lack

             of what is found there.



</pre>







Williams understood poetry's human value but had no illusions about the

difficulties his contemporaries faced in trying to engage the audience that

needed the art most desperately. To regain poetry's readership one must begin

by meeting Williams's challenge to find what "concerns many men," not simply

what concerns poets.<p>





There are at least two reasons why the situation of poetry matters to the

entire intellectual community. The first involves the role of language in a

free society. Poetry is the art of using words charged with their utmost

meaning. A society whose intellectual leaders lose the skill to shape,

appreciate, and understand the power of language will become the slaves of

those who retain it--be they politicians, preachers, copywriters, or

newscasters. The public responsibility of poetry has been pointed out

repeatedly by modern writers. Even the archsymbolist Stephane Mallarme praised

the poet's central mission to "purify the words of the tribe." And Ezra Pound

warned that<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

Good writers are those who keep the language efficient. That is to say, keep

it accurate, keep it clean. It doesn't matter whether a good writer wants to be

useful, or whether the bad writer wants to do harm. . . .<p>



If a nation's literature declines, the nation atrophies and decays.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





Or, as George Orwell wrote after the Second World War, "One ought to recognize

that the present political chaos is connected with the decay of 

language. . . ."

Poetry is not the entire solution to keeping the nation's language clear and

honest, but one is hard pressed to imagine a country's citizens improving the

health of its language while abandoning poetry.<p>







The second reason why the situation of poetry matters to all intellectuals is

that poetry is not alone among the arts in its marginal position. If the

audience for poetry has declined into a subculture of specialists, so too have

the audiences for most contemporary art forms, from serious drama to jazz. The

unprecedented fragmentation of American high culture during the past half

century has left most arts in isolation from one another as well as from the

general audience. Contemporary classical music scarcely exists as a living art

outside university departments and conservatories. Jazz, which once commanded a

broad popular audience, has become the semi-private domain of aficionados and

musicians. (Today even influential jazz innovators cannot find places to

perform in many metropolitan centers--and for an improvisatory art the

inability to perform is a crippling liability.) Much serious drama is now

confined to the margins of American theater, where it is seen only by actors,

aspiring actors, playwrights, and a few diehard fans. Only the visual arts,

perhaps because of their financial glamour and upper-class support, have

largely escaped the decline in public attention.<p>



<br>

<br>



<font size=4><b>How Poets Can Be Heard</b></font><p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE most serious question for the future of American culture is whether the

arts will continue to exist in isolation and decline into subsidized academic

specialties or whether some possibility of rapprochement with the educated

public remains. Each of the arts must face the challenge separately, and no art

faces more towering obstacles than poetry. Given the decline of literacy, the

proliferation of other media, the crisis in humanities education, the collapse

of critical standards, and the sheer weight of past failures, how can poets

possibly succeed in being heard? Wouldn't it take a miracle?<p>



<p>



Toward the end of her life Marianne Moore wrote a short poem called "O To Be a

Dragon." This poem recalled the biblical dream in which the Lord appeared to

King Solomon and said, "Ask what I shall give thee." Solomon wished for a wise

and understanding heart. Moore's wish is harder to summarize. Her poem reads,<p>







  

<CENTER>

<tt>

			If I, like Solomon, . . . <br>

            could have my wish--<p>



            my wish . . . O to be a dragon,<br>

   a symbol of the power of Heaven--of silkworm<br>

         size or immense; at times invisible.<br>

              Felicitous phenomenon!<p>

</tt>

</CENTER>











Moore got her wish. She became, as all genuine poets do, "a symbol of the power

of Heaven." She succeeded in what Robert Frost called "the utmost of

ambition"--namely "to lodge a few poems where they will be hard to get rid of."

She is permanently part of the "felicitous phenomenon" of American

literature.<p>





So wishes can come true--even extravagant ones. If I, like Marianne Moore,

could have my wish, and I, like Solomon, could have the self-control not to

wish for myself, I would wish that poetry could again become a part of American

public culture. I don't think this is impossible. All it would require is that

poets and poetry teachers take more responsibility for bringing their art to

the public. I will close with six modest proposals for how this dream might

come true.<p>





1. <I>When poets give public readings, they should spend part of every program

reciting other people's work</I>--preferably poems they admire by writers they do

not know personally. Readings should be celebrations of poetry in general, not

merely of the featured author's work.<p>





2. <I>When arts administrators plan public readings, they should avoid the

standard subculture format of poetry only.</I> Mix poetry with the other arts,

especially music. Plan evenings honoring dead or foreign writers. Combine short

critical lectures with poetry performances. Such combinations would attract an

audience from beyond the poetry world without compromising quality.<p>





3. <I>Poets need to write prose about poetry more often, more candidly, and more

effectively.</I> Poets must recapture the attention of the broader intellectual

community by writing for nonspecialist publications. They must also avoid the

jargon of contemporary academic criticism and write in a public idiom. Finally,

poets must regain the reader's trust by candidly admitting what they don't like

as well as promoting what they like. Professional courtesy has no place in

literary journalism.<p>





4. <I>Poets who compile anthologies--or even reading lists--should be

scrupulously honest in including only poems they genuinely admire.</I> Anthologies

are poetry's gateway to the general culture. They should not be used as pork

barrels for the creative-writing trade. An art expands its audience by

presenting masterpieces, not mediocrity. Anthologies should be compiled to

move, delight, and instruct readers, not to flatter the writing teachers who

assign books. Poet-anthologists must never trade the Muse's property for

professional favors.<p>





5. <I>Poetry teachers especially at the high school and undergraduate levels,

should spend less time on analysis and more on performance.</I> Poetry needs to be

liberated from literary criticism. Poems should be memorized, recited, and

performed. The sheer joy of the art must be emphasized. The pleasure of

performance is what first attracts children to poetry, the sensual excitement

of speaking and hearing the words of the poem. Performance was also the

teaching technique that kept poetry vital for centuries. Maybe it also holds

the key to poetry's future.<p>





6. <I>Finally poets and arts administrators should use radio to expand the art's

audience.</I> Poetry is an aural medium, and thus ideally suited to radio. A

little imaginative programming at the hundreds of college and public-supported

radio stations could bring poetry to millions of listeners. Some programming

exists, but it is stuck mostly in the standard subculture format of living

poets' reading their own work. Mixing poetry with music on classical and jazz

stations or creating innovative talk-radio formats could re-establish a direct

relationship between poetry and the general audience.<p>





The history of art tells the same story over and over. As art forms develop,

they establish conventions that guide creation, performance, instruction, even

analysis. But eventually these conventions grow stale. They begin to stand

between the art and its audience. Although much wonderful poetry is being

written, the American poetry establishment is locked into a series of exhausted

conventions--outmoded ways of presenting, discussing, editing, and teaching

poetry. Educational institutions have codified them into a stifling

bureaucratic etiquette that enervates the art. These conventions may once have

made sense, but today they imprison poetry in an intellectual ghetto.<p>





It is time to experiment, time to leave the well-ordered but stuffy classroom,

time to restore a vulgar vitality to poetry and unleash the energy now trapped

in the subculture. There is nothing to lose. Society has already told us that

poetry is dead. Let's build a funeral pyre out of the dessicated conventions

piled around us and watch the ancient, spangle-feathered, unkillable phoenix

rise from the ashes.<p>

<font size=5>N</font>O ONE EXPECTED the huge response that <A 

HREF="gioia.htm">"Can Poetry 

Matter?"</A> generated, especially not its author.  I wrote the essay to 

address -- as directly and candidly as possible -- the increasing 

cultural isolation of American poetry.  Although I did not set out to 

provoke controversy, I knew my criticism of the institutions which dominate 

the poetry subculture would prove unpopular in some literary circles.  

Institutions -- be they military, medical, corporate or cultural -- do not 

welcome outside criticism.  The editors of <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I> had 

warned me to expect angry letters from interested parties.  When the hate 

mail arrived, typed on letterheads of various university writing programs, 

no one was surprised.<P>



What did surprise both the <I>Atlantic </I>editors and me, however, was 

the enormously positive reaction the article created.  As soon as "Can 

Poetry Matter?" was published, the responses began.  Letters poured into 

<I>The Atlantic</I>, copies of which they shipped to me in thick bundles.  

Other mail came to me directly or through my publishers.  Reporters phoned 

at the office for interviews.  Newspaper and magazine articles appeared.  

Radio producers asked me to discuss the article on the air.  Friends 

phoned with anecdotes about the article's impact.  Strangers called to ask 

advice.  And for months the mail continued.  Eventually I received over 

400 letters from <I>Atlantic</I> readers.  They were overwhelmingly 

favorable.  Many of them felt I had not gone far enough in criticizing the 

inbred nature of the poetry world.<P>



I experienced my 15 minutes of fame with mixed emotions.  I was flattered 

by the magnitude of response.  I had hoped my article would initiate fresh 

discussion about the problems facing American poetry.  The newspaper 

clippings, which friends sent me, indicated that writers and readers 

across the country were heatedly debating the issues I had raised.  

Although some academic poets dismissed my analysis categorically, it was 

clear that the rest of the literary community took the article seriously, 

even if they disagreed with particular points in my argument.  What better 

response could an author want?<P>



Yet, as each new bundle of responses arrived, I grew more depressed.  The 

letters came in three familiar varieties -- favorable, unfavorable, and 

incoherent -- but, though they differed in tone and intent, together they 

formed an alarming map of American literary culture.  Reading through them 

each night after work, I realized that the poetry world was even more 

divided than I thought.  Virtually all of the unfavorable mail came from 

Creative Writing professionals.  Composed in the key of outraged virtue, 

these letters made three assertions: first, American poetry had never been 

healthier than today; second, poetry was thriving in the university, and, 

third, except for poets themselves, few people in America had ever cared 

much for poetry.  I had expected the first two assertions.  Examining the 

self-serving assumption behind those comforting clich&eacute;s had been the 

point of my article.  The third assertion, which appeared in dozens of 

letters, however, astonished me.  Several letters mentioned <A 

HREF="../emilyd/edintro.htm">Emily Dickinson</A> as an example of the 

poet's position in America before university writing programs began.  Her 

example is inspiring, but it hardly typifies poetry's historical position 

in American society.  How had the assumption that poetry never mattered 

originated, especially among academics who should know some literary 

history?  Had they never read about Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 

international fame?  <I>The Courtship of Miles Standish</I> sold 15,000 

copies on its first day of publication.  Did they not know how John 

Greenleaf Whittier had helped inspire the Abolitionist movement?  His 

poems were not only memorized but set to music as hymns.  He even had a 

town named after him.  Had they never heard that James Whitcomb Riley was 

so popular that his birthday became a state holiday in Indiana?  During 

Riley's final illness, President Wilson sent anxious inquiries about his 

condition.  President Theodore Roosevelt not only reviewed E.  A.  

Robinson's poetry; he also obtained him civil service sinecure in the Wall 

Street Customs House.  Robinson's later books attained the best-seller 

list.  After publishing <I>Fatal Interview</I> in 1931, Edna St.  Vincent 

Millay developed such a large audience that she was hired to deliver a 

series of poetry readings on commercial network radio.  Carl Sandburg was 

asked to address a joint session of Congress.  <A 

HREF="../frost/frostint.htm">Robert Frost</A> spoke at a Presidential 

inauguration.  One could cite dozens of other examples.<P>



Only the amnesiac can claim poetry was never popular in America.  From the 

days of Bryant and Emerson, it played 

an important role in American intellectual life -- until recently.  Surely 

it was critical for contemporary poets to understand how its position had 

become marginal.  To rationalize away poetry's current isolation by 

pretending it had always been ignored revealed a depressing brand of 

intellectual complacency.<P>



Reading the many supportive letters and articles did not especially cheer 

me up, but they did teach me a great deal about the remaining non-academic 

audience for poetry.  Isolated and disenfranchised, poetry's common 

readers still exist.  I heard from hundreds of these refugees -- 

teachers, retirees, librarians, lawyers, housewives, business executives, 

ranchers, and reporters, all of whom care passionately for poetry.  The 

emotion in their letters took me by surprise.  They feel alienated from 

what they see as a self-enclosed poetry world, and they are angry at the 

university for sequestering poetry.  I was also astonished to discover how 

many readers -- and journalists -- still resent modernism (which 

they also associate with the university) for killing the traditional kinds 

of poetry they enjoy.  Na&iuml;vely, I had thought the battle for 

modernism had been fought and finished fifty years ago.  What affected me 

most was the tone of hopeless resignation in many letters.  Americans had 

stopped reading poetry, they confided, and little could be done to remedy 

the situation.  A particularly memorable letter came from a woman in 

Oregon.  She wrote about how important the poems she knew by heart were to 

her daily sanity.  She could not understand why her son cared so little 

for poetry.  She knew he was typical of his generation and worried that 

something spiritually important was being lost in our society.  I wrote 

her an inadequate reply and mused at how, in different ways, hundreds of 

other letters echoed her concern.  The image of these people sticks with 

me.  They represent a large audience which is slowly dying from neglect.  

Some experts claim this audience no longer exists.  Soon perhaps it 

won't.<P>



I feel that one reason "Can Poetry Matter?" had such a strong impact was 

that I wrote the article not as a poet or critic but as a reader of 

poetry.  Jorge Luis Borges once confessed that he thought of himself first 

as a reader and only then as a poet or writer of fiction.  A writer's 

loyalties must lie with literature, not merely his or her own ambitions.  

I conceived of "Can Poetry Matter?" as a non-partisan analysis of poetry's 

current dilemma.  I tried as much as possible to suppress my personal 

poetic agenda and discuss my frustrations and aspirations as a reader of 

poetry and poetry criticism.  Of course, my detractors will claim 

otherwise, and they may indeed notice biases to which I myself am blind.  

Dana Gioia the reader cohabits the same skull as Dana Gioia the writer.  

But I take it as a good sign that several poets with whom I am often 

grouped by critics became angry with me because they felt the piece did 

not put forth a particular agenda.   One long-time friend denounced me to 

my face because the essay did not offer New Formalism as the cure to the 

ills of American poetry.  A few weeks later a bitter enemy wrote me a long 

fan letter.  Disinterested criticism, I discovered, makes strange 

bedfellows.<P>



I learned one other thing from the reception of my article.  When a piece 

of writing gains enough notoriety to create controversy, the responses it 

generates often have little to do with the original text.  The author has 

struck a nerve, usually by examining an issue others have ignored or 

distorted.  When all the repressed energy is suddenly released, it takes 

its own shape.  For most respondents the text itself is merely a point of 

departure.  Reading the various articles and editorials inspired by "Can 

Poetry Matter?", I was interested to see how often I was invoked to 

support an idea I disliked or to condemn a notion I endorsed.  This can be 

either amusing or annoying.  The important thing is to step aside and let 

the ideas pursue their own dialectic.  The culture is now at work, and the 

author has become only one of the spectators.<p>

	<i><font size=4>The rapid growth of office space in suburbs is creating "urban villages," which are confronting local

	governments with new kinds of urban-planning problems.</i></font></center><p>

	<p>

	

	<p>

	<font size=5>S</font><font size=3>ince the end of the second world war planners and academicians have warned

	Americans that suburban sprawl is an evil to be fought with every ounce of our

	national energy. They have condemned cars as the cause of city-killing growth.

	They have idealized mass transit. Yet, other than business and political

	interests in city downtowns, few have paid attention to their cries. We

	Americans have allowed sprawl to happen. In fact, we have reveled in our

	low-density suburban housing, our automobiles, and our decentralized living.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Now it appears that the much-reviled postwar suburban sprawl, with its sea of

	split-level houses surrounding retail businesses and apartment complexes strung

	randomly along its highways, was merely a transitional phase between the

	traditional compact pre-war city and today's metropolitan area. Our cities are

	becoming groups of interdependent "urban villages," which are business, retail,

	housing, and entertainment focal points amid a low-density cityscape. Each

	urban village has its core--a kind of new downtown--where the buildings are

	tallest, the daytime population largest, and the traffic congestion most

	severe. And each urban village has its outlying districts, which may stretch as

	far as ten miles from the core.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Urban villages represent a dramatic restructuring of America's cities and

	suburbs--one that is already affecting how millions of Americans live and work.

	Almost every city is swept up in the urban-village phenomenon--not only

	fast-growing Sunbelt cities like Atlanta and Phoenix but also slow-growing

	older ones like St. Louis and Kansas City, and archetypal cities like New York

	and Baltimore.<p>

	<p>

	<br>

	<p>

	<br>

	 <b>THE URBAN VILLAGES OF LOS ANGELES</b><p>

	<p>

	Los Angeles is perhaps the most evolved example of the urban-village

	phenomenon. Although downtown Los Angeles has recently experienced an

	unprecedented boom in office-building, the metropolitan area has simultaneously

	given rise to sixteen smaller urban-village cores, among them Century City,

	Costa Mesa/Irvine/Newport Beach, Encino, Glendale, the Airport, Warner Center,

	Ontario, Pasadena, Universal City/Burbank, and Westwood.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	One of the easiest ways to gauge the growth of Los Angeles's urban villages is

	to look at the downtown's market share of the metropolitan region's office

	space over the past decades. (Office space is used as a standard measure of

	changing patterns of urban development in this article, because the office is

	the "factory of the future." In parts of some metropolitan areas 40 to 60

	percent of the people hired for newly created jobs go to work in office

	buildings--not only white-collar workers but also support staff like janitors

	and food-service workers and security guards.) Since 1960 downtown Los

	Angeles's share of the metropolitan office market has declined from 60 to 34

	percent, as expansion has shifted to the faster-growing urban-village cores in

	the suburbs.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	The Costa Mesa/Irvine/Newport Beach complex, in Orange County provides a good

	example of how the urban-village phenomenon is reshaping greater Los Angeles.

	Until the early 1960s a series of small towns in a county whose total

	population was 868,000, the complex today is California's third largest

	downtown, as measured by office and business-park space. The first phase in the

	creation of the urban village's core was the construction of a regional

	shopping mall, as it has been in many other locations. In this case there were

	two--South Coast Plaza, in Costa Mesa, and Fashion Island, in Newport Beach,

	both of which opened in the early 1970s. Next developers completed modest

	two-story office buildings nearby for local professional firms, and light

	industrial facilities for aerospace and high-tech outfits.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	In 1980 the population of Orange County reached 1,932,708, and jobs there

	numbered 1,670,100. The boom transformed the emerging Costa Mesa/Irvine/Newport

	Beach subcenter. Office space there now totals 21.1 million square feet--well

	behind downtown Los Angeles's 36.6 million square feet, but gaining fast on

	downtown San Francisco's 26.8 million. Both the architecture and the tenants of

	the new high-rises are often the equal of those of office buildings in Los

	Angeles and San Francisco. The urban village's new hotels include a Westin, a

	Meridien, and a Four Seasons. South Coast Plaza has more sales than any other

	shopping center in the country. It is projected that once an addition is

	completed later this year, the plaza's annual retail sales will surpass those

	for both downtown San Francisco and the "Golden Triangle" of Beverly Hills.

	South Coast Plaza has most of the exclusive shops found in those locations.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Many of Los Angeles's established urban villages are gaining their own

	identities. Los Angeles's aerospace industry is increasingly concentrated at

	the Airport and in Torrance. The entertainment industry, which has

	traditionally been located in Hollywood, is now moving over the Hollywood Hills

	to Universal City/Burbank. Los Angeles's insurance companies, traditionally

	found in the mid-Wilshire Boulevard district two miles west of downtown, have

	recently selected Pasadena as an insurance subcenter, because it is closer than

	the mid-Wilshire location to neighborhoods from which they can expect to

	attract clerical workers and is also close to an executive-housing

	neighborhood.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	The insurance and financial industries are transforming Pasadena, a city of

	128,500 residents eight miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, into an

	urban-village core. Perhaps the best-known city of its size in America because

	of the annual Tournament of Roses Parade and Rose Bowl, Pasadena's history and

	image have long been conservative and "old money." However, by 1970 downtown

	Pasadena was marred by empty storefronts, fading turn-of-the-century resort

	hotels, and half-empty parking lots. Low-income, primarily black and Latino

	northwest Pasadena was troubled by crime, gangs, drugs, and welfare

	dependency.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	In the early 1970s the I-210 freeway was completed, connecting the city to the

	rest of the San Gabriel Valley and eventually resulting in a spurt of

	office-building. Pasadena became a back-office employment center for insurance

	and banking offices that wanted to hire middle-class Angelenos living in the

	rapidly growing San Gabriel Valley suburbs. Since 1980 twenty-eight mid- and

	high-rise office buildings have gone up.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Because of all this office construction, the character of downtown Pasadena has

	changed radically. A shopping mall several blocks from City Hall, which opened

	in 1980, is among the most successful in southern California. Entire blocks of

	handsome 1920s and 1930s two-story commercial buildings have been restored, and

	restaurants, espresso bars, and shops are now moving into ground-floor retail

	space that had gone begging for many years.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	On the edge of downtown, within walking distance of the new offices and shops,

	badly run-down single-family housing has been replaced by new condominiums and

	townhouses. Thousands of houses in nearby residential neighborhoods have been

	renovated as young families have discovered the city's turn-of-the-century

	architecture and tree-shaded streets.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Change has not come easily to Pasadena. Not all of the city is being renovated;

	residents of the still decaying northwest section fear that new construction

	will squeeze them out of the neighborhood. And the many new jobs have created

	traffic problems. Today about 60,000 people commute to work in Pasadena,

	whereas approximately 25,000 leave the city for jobs elsewhere.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Pasadena residents worry about the long-range impact of the downtown

	construction on the overall community. Why has Pasadena attracted back-office

	operations instead of professional and corporate tenants, which would be more

	in keeping with the city's lingering blue-blood image? Does Pasadena want more

	high-rise office towers of any kind? How will the growing traffic affect

	downtown Pasadena and the nearby reviving neighborhoods?<p>

	<p>

	<br>

	<p>

	<br>

	<b>WHY SUBURBS ARE BECOMING URBAN VILLAGES</b><p>

	<p>

	This debate over growth is being repeated in neighborhood associations and city

	councils across the nation, in such widely dispersed locations as Walnut Creek,

	California; Princeton, New Jersey; Schaumburg, Illinois; and Bethesda,

	Maryland. In fact, attempts to control growth and traffic congestion are among

	the hottest issues in local politics today. And the reason is that the

	urban-village phenomenon is reshaping our cities. However, most people do not

	see the larger picture; they simply see the consequences. The phenomenon has

	occurred simultaneously in all kinds of cities across the nation, mostly for

	five reasons. Four of these have helped to create or further the postwar

	pattern of sprawl. When the fifth reason comes into play, it is easier to see

	why our metropolitan regions are coalescing into these sub-centers.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	One reason for the growth of urban villages is that the nation's economy is

	shifting from a manufacturing to a service and knowledge base. The number of

	industrial jobs has declined from one third of all jobs in 1920 to one sixth

	today. The figure may drop to less than one tenth by the year 2000, with

	service and knowledge employment making up the difference, much as agricultural

	employment fell and industrial employment rose during the transition to an

	industrial economy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. From

	1973 to 1985, while five million blue-collar industrial jobs were lost, the

	service and knowledge fields-- which are as diverse as computer programming,

	the professions, retail sales, and fast food--accounted for all of the nation's

	employment growth (from 82 million to 110 million jobs). The Bureau of Labor

	Statistics reports that the number of service and knowledge jobs can be

	expected to grow by nine million in the next ten years. The shift to a service

	and knowledge economy has greatly accelerated the restructuring of our

	metropolitan areas by creating a need for much more office space. In eight

	years, from the beginning of 1978 through 1985, 1.1 billion square feet of

	office space was constructed in the United States--the equivalent of 220 World

	Trade Center towers.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	People are willing to live near the office now, whereas they were reluctant to

	live near factories that were dirty, noisy, and visually unattractive.

	Traditionally the poor and the working class have lived near factory districts.

	Across the nation office buildings and high-tech business parks have appeared

	in middle-class and even exclusive suburbs, such as the horse country around

	Valley Forge, outside Philadelphia; Bellevue, near Seattle; and the Buckhead

	district, in the north Atlanta suburbs. In Newport Beach, California, south of

	Los Angeles, a new subdivision of homes costing from $300,000 to $2 million

	abuts a Ford aerospace facility doing research and small-component-part

	assembly for military contracts.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	A second reason for the emergence of urban villages has been changes in

	transportation patterns. Business shipments have shifted from rail to truck and

	Americans have decided that they prefer automobile commuting to mass transit.

	With fixed-rail transportation, all shipments must go from central terminal to

	central terminal before delivery. With trucks, shipments can travel from door

	to door. Similarly, with automobiles, people can go from door to door whenever

	they choose, without having to pass through central stations and terminals at

	fixed times. By 1960, the first year that the U.S. Bureau of the Census kept

	track, 69.5 percent of all commuting trips were made by car. By 1980 the figure

	had increased to 86 percent.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	A third reason has been recent telecommunications advances, notably the

	dramatic drop in long-distance telephone costs. More and more day-to-day work

	is being done over the telephone. Not only cheaper long-distance telephone

	rates but also overnight mail, telecopiers, Zap-Mail, and computer modems allow

	communication without physical proximity.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Fourth, it is cheaper for businesses to operate in urban villages than in

	cities. Suburban office, industrial, and retail rents are far lower than

	downtown rents are. Although construction costs are approximately the same in

	the two areas, land outside cities costs less--$10 to $50 per square foot in

	suburban office locations versus $50 to $1,000 per square foot downtown. The

	cost of building parking spaces is also lower in the suburbs, where most

	parking is located in above-ground structures or surface lots, both of which

	are much cheaper to construct than a downtown office tower's subterranean

	garage. The difference in land and parking-garage costs shows up in office

	rents--$15 to $24 per square foot per year for prestige high-rise suburban

	space versus $18 to $42 for comparable downtown space in most American

	metropolitan areas.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	These factors might only have encouraged more suburban sprawl if another factor

	had not come into play: most Americans like cities and the concentration of

	services that they provide. A critical mass of employment and housing is

	necessary to support desirable everyday services such as a good selection of

	shops, restaurants, and hotels. But this critical mass is achieved at well

	below the size of the prewar downtowns. For instance, it takes about 250,000

	people within a three-to-five-mile radius to support a modest regional mall and

	about 20,000 middle-class people within an equal area to keep a good restaurant

	in business. And it requires roughly 2.5 million square feet of offices (about

	fifty typical three-story suburban office buildings) to support a 250-room

	hotel.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Since people do not want to drive very far for these services, particularly

	office workers looking for lunch or business travelers needing a hotel, a

	degree of concentration much greater than that of a low-density suburb is

	necessary. Only so many potential locations have the necessary highway access

	and visibility to permit this concentration, a fact that has led to the

	focusing of postwar suburban sprawl into urban-village cores. When prime

	urban-village cores become congested, developers and employers hopscotch to

	outlying locations where land is cheaper and commuting is easier.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Thus our metropolitan areas have expanded tremendously. In the past twenty-five

	years, for example, metropolitan New York's sphere of direct influence has

	tripled in size. The metropolitan area extends as far north as New Haven,

	Connecticut, and into once-rural Dutchess, Ulster, and Sullivan counties, in

	New York State. On Long Island the metropolitan area now encompasses Yaphank

	and Brookhaven, in the middle of Suffolk County, and fades away just miles from

	the Hamptons. Metropolitan New York has swept southward past Princeton and into

	Ocean County, New Jersey, and Bucks County, Pennsylvania. In several years New

	York's suburban growth will collide with that of slower-growing metropolitan

	Philadelphia.<p>

	<p>

	Los Angeles has always had an enormous metropolitan area; it was knit together

	before the Second World War by the world's largest trolley system. By 1960

	metropolitan Los Angeles's sphere of influence stretched to Santa Monica in the

	west, Pasadena in the east, Long Beach in the south, and the San Fernando

	Valley in the north. Now metropolitan Los Angeles extends westward into Ventura

	County, east to San Bernardino and Riverside, and south across most of Orange

	County to span an area many times the metropolitan area's size twenty-five

	years ago. Other cities--among them greater San Francisco, Phoenix, Dallas,

	Houston, Boston, Chicago, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C.--are also expanding

	quickly.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	As outlying urban-village cores become more urban, with their high-rise office

	buildings and hotels, increasingly sophisticated shopping, and high-density

	housing, the center cities are becoming more suburban. This emerging trend

	extends beyond the fast-food restaurants on downtown business streets and

	festive retailing complexes like South Street Seaport. In Lower Manhattan, and

	Harborplace, in Baltimore. Suburban-style shopping centers--where you buy

	children's clothes and household appliances, not just clever T-shirts and

	scented soaps--have recently opened in several American cities, and are doing

	quite well. Large, privately financed apartment and condominium projects have

	been built in cities without a downtown residential tradition, including San

	Diego, Detroit, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.<p>

	<br>

	<b>HOW URBAN VILLAGES AFFECT CITIES</b><p>

	<p>

	Few cities have been transformed by the urban-village phenomenon as rapidly as

	Atlanta, whose metropolitan region has a population of 2.2 million, having

	gained 90,000 residents last year and 78,000 the previous year. In 1980

	downtown Atlanta was the metropolitan region's unchallenged center for all

	kinds of office employment. Although urban-village cores were emerging around

	shopping malls at the intersections of major highways, office space was

	limited. And neither in the appearance of the buildings nor in the quality of

	the tenants were the fledgling urban-village cores any match for the downtown

	high-rises. Most of the buildings were two-story wood-frame structures, and

	many of their tenants were banks and insurance companies renting inexpensive

	space for back-office operations.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	By 1985--just five years later--this pecking order had changed completely.

	Downtown Atlanta had gained 4.3 million square feet of new office space, but

	Perimeter Center, at the I-285/Georgia 400 intersection, due north of downtown,

	had gained 7.6 million, and Cumberland/Galleria, at the I-285/I-75

	intersection, northeast of downtown, 10.6 million. Many of the new buildings

	were gleaming, architecturally distinguished high-rises of the kind that once

	had been built only downtown. If present trends continue, the amounts of office

	space in both the Perimeter Center and the Cumberland/ Galleria urban-village

	cores will easily surpass the amount in downtown Atlanta by 1990.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Downtown Atlanta, like downtown Los Angeles, is losing its metropolitan

	hegemony and becoming just another one of the region's urban-village cores. The

	urban villages around it, like those around downtown Los Angeles, are gaining

	distinct identities. Government, professional services, finance, wholesale

	trade, and the convention business are still in downtown Atlanta. However, as

	prestigious high-rises have been completed at Perimeter Center and

	Cumberland/Galleria, those areas have lost many of their price-conscious

	back-office banking and insurance tenants and have become instead favorite

	Atlanta locations for corporate headquarters and business services. Nearly

	every major accounting firm and many downtown law firms have offices in

	Perimeter Center and Cumberland/Galleria, the better to serve their clients.

	The regional corporate headquarters of Northern Telecom and HBO are in

	Perimeter Center.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Despite their importance as business locations, Perimeter Center and

	Cumberland/Galleria do not boast that traditional downtown symbol, a soaring

	skyline of office buildings. The high-rises in these two urban-village cores

	are not clustered. Instead they are widely separated by parking lots and

	heavily landscaped open space. In keeping with the non-urban mood, the

	developers have even neglected to add sidewalks connecting the buildings, and

	most people use their cars instead of walking. From the top floor of a

	seventeen-story high-rise in Perimeter Center the view is mostly trees and

	lawns, not other office buildings. Like many (though not all) urban-village

	cores, these relatively low-density north Atlanta developments visually blend

	into the suburban landscape. Yet the explosive rise in the number of office

	workers and their cars at Perimeter Center and Cumberland/Galleria has affected

	once-peaceful residential neighborhoods, including the Spring Mill area, near

	Perimeter Center.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	One surprising result of Perimeter Center's boom has also been seen in suburban

	Dallas, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., and may be a trend. Residents of

	middle-class subdivisions near high-rise office clusters are banding together

	in corporations, getting their neighborhoods re-zoned for offices, and selling

	large "assembled" land parcels to real-estate developers, who either raze the

	houses or move them to new sites and build high-rises on the land. The suburban

	homeowners see the chance to leave an increasingly congested neighborhood where

	house prices are not keeping pace with those in comparable but quieter

	subdivisions nearby. Often they can sell their lots for twice what the homes on

	them are worth.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	One such group formed three years ago in Spring Mill, a subdivision abutted on

	three sides by the high-rise office complexes of Perimeter Center. Randy

	Campbell, a former Spring Mill resident, recalls seeing a notice in a

	neighborhood newsletter in July of 1983 asking residents if they wanted to sell

	their property to office developers. "If you were interested," Campbell says,

	"you tore off a strip of paper on the bottom of one page, filled in your name,

	and sent it to the head of the neighborhood association. All but three or four

	of the 117 homeowners mailed in that piece of paper, so we got together in the

	community room of the Perimeter Mall. The average Spring Mill house sold for

	$70,000 to $75,000 then, but we learned that the half-acre lots were worth

	three times that figure to office-building developers. We didn't know how to go

	about the re-zoning or sale. So all the neighbors appointed a committee of five

	men and four women--small-business owners, several attorneys, a clergyman, an

	accountant, and a stockbroker. That was me."<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	For the next few months the committee met almost every night, learning about

	real-estate development and discussing strategy. By the end of the summer

	Alston &amp; Bird, Georgia's largest law firm, had agreed to represent the

	homeowners on a contingency basis, and the firm drafted an option agreement to

	create Kingsborough-Spring Mill, Inc., a nonprofit corporation. By signing this

	option agreement a homeowner gave Kingsborough-Spring Mill's three-person board

	of directors power of attorney to accept a minimum of $225,000 in cash for his

	home, net after any expenses. It was understood that no deal would be final

	until the county commissioners changed Spring Mill's zoning from single-family

	homes to high-rise offices and multi-family units.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	The night that Alston &amp; Bird presented the agreement, in October of 1980,

	eighty homeowners signed it, and by January of 1984 the figure had risen to 114

	of the 117. "Once the neighborhood was 'tied up'," Campbell says, "we looked

	for a buyer. They weren't knocking the doors down, because we wanted top dollar

	and all cash. As we explored various deals, all the neighbors wanted to know

	what was happening. So we prepared a newsletter almost daily, ran it off on our

	office copying machines, and stuffed it into everyone's mailboxes during our

	lunch hours."<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	In October of 1984 the board of directors located a buyer. "Albritton

	Development wanted to redevelop the twenty-seven-parcel Lake Hearn Place

	subdivision adjacent to Spring Mill," Campbell says. "But the Dekalb County

	commissioners rejected the re-zoning, reportedly because the project was too

	small, too piecemeal. So we made a deal with Albritton, which combined Lake

	Hearn's twenty-seven lots, the hundred and fourteen lots that we represented,

	and the three other Spring Mill owners that didn't join the neighborhood

	corporation. That made eighty-two acres--hardly piecemeal."<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	In June of 1985, however, the Dekalb County commissioners denied the re-zoning

	request for the site. Six months later Kingsborough-Spring Mill, Inc., the Lake

	Hearn Place homeowners, and Albritton Development sued the county

	commissioners. By last June the case had ended up in the Georgia Supreme Court,

	which ruled six to one in favor of the homeowners.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	

	Baltimore is another kind of city being reshaped by the urban-village trend.

	Despite all the good news about Harborplace and the renovation of

	nineteenth-century row houses, the Baltimore metropolitan area is essentially

	stagnant. The population of the metropolitan area, as defined by the City of

	Baltimore and Baltimore County, declined from 1.53 million in 1970 to 1.44

	million in 1980, and it is projected to drop to 1.40 million in 1990.

	Employment is growing only modestly--from 771,300 jobs in 1980 to 782,400 in

	1985 and to 813,400 estimated for 1990. The Baltimore metropolitan area hardly

	seems like the place for a surge in construction. Yet there has been a boom in

	the outlying districts of Towson, Owings Mills, White Marsh, and perhaps most

	notably Hunt Valley.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Hunt Valley, twenty miles north of downtown Baltimore, was farmland until

	recently. Now it has a prestigious high-rise office and hotel core, which is

	surrounded by surface parking and low-rise industrial and office space. The

	low-rise industrial and office complexes came first, when well-to-do Baltimore

	businessmen decided to move their plants and offices closer to their homes in

	the north and northwest sections of the metropolitan area. After Hunt Valley

	was established as an employment center that offered low rents, the major

	landowner--McCormick Properties, owned by the family that owns the McCormick

	spice company--upgraded Hunt Valley by building high-quality mid- and high-rise

	office space and a Marriott Hotel. The PHH Group, Westinghouse, Burroughs, and

	Allstate Insurance promptly moved in. Now Hunt Valley is Baltimore County's top

	corporate address.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Even New York City has fallen under the sway of decentralizing urban-village

	development--which is surprising, considering that New York is the classic

	example of the traditional pre-Second World War city and that Manhattan has

	never been more prosperous nor its skyline more crowded with construction

	cranes. But although Manhattan gained 23.5 million square feet of office space

	from 1982 to 1985, during this short time its share of the metropolitan area's

	more than half a billion square feet of office space fell from 67 percent to 60

	percent. This year, too, 7.6 million square feet is scheduled to be completed

	in Manhattan, bringing its total to 317.6 million--and 16.1 million square feet

	of office space is scheduled to be added to suburbs within a sixty-mile radius

	of Times Square, bringing the suburban total to 216.1 million.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	In the past the typical new office building in New York's suburbs was part of

	the campus-like headquarters of a major corporation in Westchester County or

	southwestern Connecticut. Today, though, the exodus of corporate headquarters

	from Manhattan--to the suburbs or other parts of the country--has slowed. Now

	the typical new building is built on speculation, in an urban-village core such

	as Stamford or Danbury in Connecticut, the Route 110 corridor on Long Island,

	or Morristown or Princeton in New Jersey. One kind of tenant is a corporation's

	back-office operations or an entire division that can be separated from the

	Manhattan headquarters at considerable savings in rent, taxes, and business

	services but linked to the main office by computers and telecommunications.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	As more and more jobs move to the suburbs (most of the metropolitan region's

	employment growth in the next decade is expected to take place not in New York

	City but in northern New Jersey), housing construction is booming in outlying

	towns. At Brookhaven, in Long Island's Suffolk County, 4,000 homes were built

	last year and another 8,000 are planned. At Dover, New York, a Dutchess County

	town of 7,200 residents northeast of Poughkeepsie, developers have filed

	proposals with the planning board for 1,200 new condominium units. The

	transformation is likely to be even more rapid at Chester, New York, fifty-five

	miles northwest of New York City. The population is 7,000, and the town board

	has received proposals for 3,000 new condominiums and homes.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	In attractive communities near urban-village cores the prices of existing homes

	are rising fast, owing to the sudden demand from employees of relocated

	companies. That is one reason that metropolitan New York city experienced a

	24.6 percent increase in the price of housing between the first quarter of 1984

	and the same period in 1985. In Stamford, for example, a typical three-bedroom

	house now sells for at least $250,000.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	The Princeton, New Jersey, area illustrates the impact of the urban-village

	trend on metropolitan New York. Seemingly overnight a metropolis-sized

	urban-village core has emerged several miles east of this tree-shaded college

	town on U.S. Route 1. It is estimated that by the mid-1990s the Princeton

	corridor will have 12 to 15 million square feet of office space--surpassing the

	amount currently in downtown Milwaukee, downtown Newark or southwest

	Connecticut's I-95 corridor between Greenwich and Stamford. Two luxury hotels

	have opened in greater Princeton: a Marriott and a Radisson are planned. The

	number of housing units is expected to double, with over 25,000 scheduled for

	completion by 1990. If current growth projections prove to be accurate, greater

	Princeton will become New Jersey's largest city in ten years.<p>

	<p>

	<br>

	<p>

	<br>

	<b>HOUSING FOR ALL URBAN-VILLAGE WORKERS</b><p>

	<p>

	None of the far-reaching social, economic, and political issues raised by urban

	villages has a broader and deeper impact than housing. Urban-village cores

	generally arise at the outskirts of cities and grow in a limited number of

	directions. Nearly all of Atlanta's urban villages, for example, are in the

	northern suburbs, leaving the southern part of the city largely unaffected.

	Dallas is growing mostly toward the north and northwest. St. Louis, not exactly

	a booming metropolitan area, is heading west and northwest. The vast majority

	of America's urban villages, in fact, have one thing in common: they are

	growing in white, upper-middle-class areas. Executives and business owners

	usually make the decisions about office locations and industrial sites. Most of

	them are white and upper-middle-class, and they usually decide to bring their

	offices or industrial plants nearer their homes.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	This arrangement is time- and energy-efficient for executives and business

	owners but not necessarily for clerical, light-assembly, and service employees,

	nor for the employees of the stores, restaurants, and gas stations near offices

	and plants. These workers cannot afford the executive-priced single-family

	houses, townhouses, and condominiums near most urban-village cores. They face a

	long--and often expensive--car or bus commute to the suburban or city home they

	can afford to live in.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	The scenes in the parking lots of north Atlanta's Perimeter Center at 5:00 show

	the results of this geographical mismatch. Executives and professionals get

	into their Cadillacs and BMWs for the relatively easy drive home or a visit to

	one of the nearby "formula" restaurants for a drink. At the same time, many

	black employees are walking through the parking lots--Perimeter Center has few

	sidewalks--on their way to the bus stops, which are little more than a pole

	with a bus sign on top, planted on a flat, grassy spot that usually turns into

	mud when it rains. Atlanta's working-class black sections are south of

	downtown, fifteen to twenty miles from Perimeter Center, but the roads and bus

	lines to them don't follow a straight line. With one or maybe two transfers,

	many bus passengers endure a one-to-two-hour ride twice a day.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Suburban fast-food restaurants, hotels, department stores, car washes, and

	cleaning services are already experiencing a shortage of low-paid service

	employees. In some fast-growing suburbs businesses are offering bounties for

	new employees, raising the starting pay from the $3.35 minimum wage to $4.00 or

	more, and offering raises after several weeks rather than a year. One solution

	to the shortage is to bring affordable housing closer to the employment in the

	suburban urban-village cores.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	This idea is one of the most polarizing issues in local politics today. Most

	suburbs have raised the drawbridge against housing for the poor and the working

	class, as epitomized by new guarded and gated "secure" communities. Affluent

	families do not want low-income housing in their one-acre-lot neighborhoods.

	Nor do they need to allow it. Our urban villages now encompass areas the size

	of many pre-Second World War cities. They have more than enough land for all

	kinds of housing--and socioeconomic groups--if zoning boards permit affordable

	housing.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	The key to truly affordable, non-subsidized suburban housing is allowing higher

	density, primarily in the form of rental apartments, so that fixed land costs

	are spread over more units. Building suburban apartments in smaller than

	average sizes, to reduce rents, should be permitted. Empire West, a Tucson

	developer, has built smaller than average apartments in the Southwest. Situated

	in 250-to-500-unit projects, the apartments range from 320-square-foot studios

	(equivalent to a l4-by-23-foot space), to 615-square-foot two-bedrooms (a

	20-by-30-foot space). All apartments have complete kitchens, bathrooms, and

	closets, and are outfitted with scaled-down furniture.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	These complexes usually offer the lowest rents in their local

	markets--typically from $225 to $400, at least $25 to $50 a month below rents

	for the cheapest conventional apartments. These rents fit the budgets of

	clerical employees, security guards, and maintenance workers who make less than

	$15,000 a year. Yet the complexes still offer "luxury" features like swimming

	pools, tennis courts, volleyball courts, and social events.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Of course, upper-middle-class suburbanites fight almost any kind of

	high-density housing. But attached housing complexes don't have to be built in

	affluent neighborhoods. They have been successful near commercial districts,

	where they create a buffer between a single-family-home neighborhood and an

	office-and-retail district. Another logical place for apartments is next to an

	urban village's commercial core. It seems likely that the vast surface parking

	lots of regional shopping malls will eventually be redeveloped as high-density

	housing and commercial buildings, with the cars going into above-ground or even

	underground structures. When these apartment and condominium developments are

	built near the shopping centers that form the focal point of so many urban

	villages, the members of more age groups and economic classes will be able to

	live near where they work and shop.<p>

	<p>

	<br>

	<p>

	<br>

	<b>NEW TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS</b><p>

	<p>

	In most metropolitan areas the suburban rush hour now rivals downtown traffic,

	and in some surpasses it. The 1980 census reported that 27 million Americans

	commuted from one suburb to another, whereas only half that number traveled

	from suburbs to downtown cities. The imbalance has increased sharply since

	1980, owing to the boom in suburban employment. Today's suburban highways are

	so overcrowded that once-easy five- and six-mile commutes take forty-five

	minutes of stop-and-go driving in locations as widely dispersed as north

	Dallas; Contra Costa County, east of San Francisco; and northern Virginia, near

	Washington, D.C. And the emergence of urban villages at the edges of the

	metropolitan areas--like Chesterfield, twenty-two miles west of downtown St.

	Louis--have brought bumper-to-bumper traffic to two-lane country roads that

	still run past farms and cow pastures.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Living up to its image, Los Angeles has the most heavily traveled freeways in

	the nation. The three busiest points on them are now near urban villages--miles

	from downtown Los Angeles and its four-level interchange, which once held the

	city's traffic record but has now fallen to fifth place. To reach their

	record-setting traffic levels, these Los Angeles freeways--like the slow-moving

	highways outside other cities--do not have a morning rush hour in one direction

	and an evening rush hour in the other. Commuter traffic now comes to a

	standstill at morning and early evening in both directions, and slowdowns occur

	frequently throughout the day.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Unfortunately, some city planners examining metropolitan-area congestion do not

	acknowledge the traffic near urban villages and repeat time-worn cliches about

	automobiles destroying cities. Others recommend the expansion of highways and

	mass-transit systems, but continue to think only of access to downtown, just as

	transportation needs soar in the suburbs. Still others recognize the rise of

	urban-village cores in the suburbs but propose transportation plans that are

	years behind the demand.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Planners and governments are working under a serious handicap in alleviating

	suburban traffic problems. Most urban-village cores are being created by

	private developers in a series of unrelated, uncoordinated decisions. To make

	matters worse, the process of formulating a transportation plan, gaining its

	approval, finding the funds, and completing the project is so time-consuming

	that traffic problems are bound to become painfully obvious before any action

	is taken.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	How can government alleviate suburban traffic congestion near urban-village

	cores? The answer is not the construction of subways or elevated trains.

	Fixed-rail projects (unlike light-rail construction--for example, trolleys)

	justify their enormous capital expenditure and high operating costs "only when

	you have both trip originations and destinations highly clustered," according

	to Peter Muller, a professor of geography at the University of Miami and one of

	the earliest observers of the urban-village phenomenon. "We are building

	1920s-style mass-transit systems for our 1990s metropolitan areas," he says.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	One example of the gap between urban image and reality is Walnut Creek,

	California, near San Francisco, which has experienced considerable office and

	light-industrial development in the past decade. Although most of the new

	buildings are near the BART mass-transit station connecting the town to San

	Francisco, Walnut Creek now has such severe traffic congestion that last year

	it enacted an office-construction moratorium. Muller suggests that mass transit

	failed to help the town avoid traffic problems because the vast majority of the

	local workers commute by car regardless of a mass-transit option. "A great many

	of the people who ride the new fixed-rail mass-transit systems in cities like

	San Francisco, Atlanta, or Miami, used to ride buses," he says.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Nonetheless, fixed-rail transit remains a gleam in many a downtown

	businessman's or politician's eye. Some proponents may imagine that it takes a

	subway for a city to be a city, and some may have in mind that the federal

	government has paid up to 90 percent of the bill in the past (though it will

	not in the future, if the policies of the present Administration remain in

	place). Even Los Angeles--the capital of California's "car kingdom"--wants to

	build an eighteen-to-twenty-mile "metrorail" subway system, at a cost of 53

	billion. According to an official of the Southern California Rapid Transit

	District, the metrorail system "may come close to breaking even on an operating

	basis, but there is no way that it will pay for the construction of the

	system." Of course, this statement is based on predictions of operating cost

	and ridership. The reality of Atlanta's new MARTA fixed-rail system is that the

	fare box brings in only 35 to 40 percent of the annual operating budget, which

	would more than double if a reasonable amortization of the capital cost were

	included. Moreover, the proposed Los Angeles subway route serves downtown and

	only two of the sixteen other urban-village cores in the metropolitan region.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Even buses do not fully meet the needs of the emerging urban-village cores,

	because serving all the possible permutations between where people live and

	work would require too many routes to be economically feasible. In the new

	urban-village cores office and industrial buildings are not closely packed

	together, as they are in midtown Manhattan or Chicago's Loop; they are widely

	separated by parking lots and landscaped areas.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	This lack of density means that only a few people will find it convenient to

	walk to any given bus or subway station, and that office workers must have a

	car during the day if they want to visit a client or go out to lunch. And where

	internal transit programs using buses and mini-vans have been tried, such as

	Tysons corner, Virginia, and south of the Los Angeles International Airport,

	they have quickly failed for lack of patronage. In fact, even an official of

	the federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration asserts that conventional

	fixed-route transit systems will never carry more than a small percentage of

	non-downtown commuters. The official thinks that the only kind of mass transit

	with any chance of significantly decreasing commuter traffic is ride-sharing,

	and particularly car-pooling.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	That leaves us with our automobiles. The new office complexes provide more room

	for cars than for the workers who drive them. The typical building allots

	approximately 200 square feet of space for each employee. The usual planning

	assumption is that one out of five workers uses a car pool or public

	transportation, and so a building will require four parking spaces for every

	1,000 square feet of office space. Each parking space requires approximately

	325 Square feet for the space itself. ramps (if a garage, rather than a lot, is

	planned), and aisles. That means the developer must set aside 1,300 square feet

	of parking for every 1,000 square feet of office space.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Two years ago some of the nation's leading urban planners gathered in

	Scottsdale, Arizona, and searched for solutions to suburban traffic congestion.

	The planners expressed considerable disagreement, presented a myriad of

	solutions but little data to support the ideas, and were greatly concerned

	about finding the money to pay for any transportation improvements. The

	planners did for the most part agree on an approach to the problem: government

	working together with developers. This is already happening. In north Atlanta's

	fast-growing Buckhead urban-village core, for instance, developers paid $1

	million toward a new $5.2 million bridge over a highway interchange. And in

	Montgomery County, Maryland, developers will pay half of the $109 million

	needed for road improvements around Germantown, an emerging urban-village core.

	Many developers favor this new spirit of public-private cooperation, because

	they realize that the alternative could be government-ordered construction

	slowdowns or moratoriums.<p>

	<p>

	<br>

	<p>

	<br>

	<b>PLANNING FOR URBAN VILLAGES</b><p>

	<p>

	Local governments can resist developers, but they can't resist them

	indefinitely or protect their communities from the bad effects of rapid growth.

	They are decentralized nineteenth-century entities trying to deal with

	far-reaching twenty-first-century issues. Greater Los Angeles, for instance,

	consists of well over a hundred cities and five counties. Metropolitan Atlanta

	has forty-six cities and seven counties. How can so many governmental

	jurisdictions possibly coordinate their actions to handle the amorphous growth

	of urban-village cores, which, like multinational corporations, know no loyalty

	to any single governmental body?<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Real-estate developers most often deal directly with local governments. In this

	high-stakes game the developers hold many of the cards, because they can play

	one jurisdiction off another. Many local governments, in their desire to expand

	their tax bases, generate employment, and welcome "progress," try to entice

	developers with liberal zoning, temporary tax abatements, and improvements to

	such things as roads and sewers at little or no cost.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Contrary to what their residents often think, well-to-do communities cannot

	totally control growth on their own, unless they are geographically isolated,

	like Santa Barbara, California. When a town is part of a metropolitan area, its

	fate is inextricably tied up with the region's, no matter how wealthy its

	residents or how stringent its growth regulations.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Even Beverly Hills finds itself relatively powerless to resist the relentless

	development pressures from Los Angeles, which almost completely surrounds the

	5.7-square-mile city. Several years ago Four Seasons Hotels wanted to build a

	high-rise hotel on Wilshire Boulevard near Rodeo Drive, in the heart of the

	city's commercial Golden Triangle. The issues of building density and

	hotel-generated traffic congestion became so controversial that the city

	council refused to vote on the Four Seasons project and instead placed a

	hotel-development ordinance on the ballot. Last year Beverly Hills voters

	overwhelmingly defeated the ordinance, thereby eliminating the possibility that

	another major hotel will open in the city. That didn't stop Four Seasons.

	Earlier this year the company started construction on a 287-room, 15-story

	hotel on Doheny Drive and Burton Way, literally across the street from the

	Beverly Hills city line. Beverly Hills lost the new hotel's sales and occupancy

	tax revenues but will still be affected by the traffic.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	What can local government do about growth pressures? Probably the best solution

	is the creation of strong, effective, multi-city and multi-county agencies, and

	perhaps even entire government structures, that correspond to the actual

	economic and psychological boundaries of a metropolitan area and its urban

	villages. Such broad-based government has already been pioneered by

	Indianapolis (Marion County) and Miami (Dade County.) This governmental

	reorganization is not easy, because it can involve jealously competing towns,

	townships, cities, and counties--not to mention states, as are involved in

	greater New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., St. Louis, and Kansas City.

	But much as the number of school districts nationwide has shrunk from 100,000

	in 1940 to 15,000 now, the number of planning jurisdictions can be brought

	down.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	One possible first step toward the creation of more-effective local governments

	is metropolitan-wide zoning and planning boards that have real clout in

	granting zoning changes and allocating improvements to the region's physical

	facilities. Some metropolitan areas are already moving in this direction. In

	1979 Phoenix--the nation's ninth largest city, according to the most recent

	census--took the revolutionary course of adopting the urban-village concept in

	its planning process. In 1985 the city finished its General Plan to guide the

	municipality's growth, and this established nine urban villages. "Each [urban

	village] would become relatively self-sufficient in providing living, working

	and recreational opportunities for residents," the General Plan said. The city

	also encouraged the "concentration of shopping, employment and services located

	in the village core."<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Phoenix is using zoning approvals and planned allocations of money for physical

	improvements to try to match employment with housing. The city has clearly

	specified goals. In 1980 only two of the now defined urban villages had more

	than half as many jobs as people, indicating that they had moved beyond being

	bedroom communities. Phoenix hopes that by the year 2000 five urban villages

	will have more than half as many jobs as people, with the remaining four urban

	villages having between one fourth and half as many, clearly showing that jobs

	and people have moved closer together.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Elsewhere, developers, employers, and local governments have created

	transportation-management associations (TMAs) to find solutions to

	transportation problems. What are perceived locally as transportation crises

	have brought TMAs into existence in Baltimore's airport area; Warner Center, in

	Los Angeles's San Fernando Valley; north Dallas; and Tysons Corner, Virginia.

	According to Kenneth Orski, the president of Urban Mobility Corporation, which

	is a TMA proponent based in Washington, D.C., TMAs "fill a vacuum in suburban

	areas."<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Besides organizing ride-sharing and van pools, promoting staggered work hours,

	and lobbying for government-funded capital improvements, some TMAs are

	expanding their role into child care, private police, and other services for

	their geographic areas. It is imaginable that TMAs, born of the

	traffic-congestion crisis, could mature into an echelon of government well

	suited to the realities of our emerging urban villages.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	Considering what has happened so far, is the urban-village trend a good or a

	bad thing for our cities and our citizens? To a certain extent the question is

	irrelevant, because the trend is already so advanced that it is irreversible.

	But it is hard to imagine the ideal urban village as being anything but very

	good. The opportunity for all kinds of Americans to live, work, shop, and play

	in the same geographic area--while retaining easy access to other urban-village

	cores with specialized features that their own district lacks--seems almost too

	good to be true.<p>

	<p>

	<p>

	As the nation's cities reshape themselves along the urban-villages model, we

	must ask ourselves, What are the design features, housing policies,

	transportation solutions, and governmental structures that will make our cities

	and the lives of their residents more productive and satisfying. Unfortunately,

	the questions and opinions vastly outnumber the solutions and directions. A

	great deal of study, experimentation, and planning needs to be done--and done

	quickly--to help cities that are being rebuilt almost from scratch.

But shifts are occurring, writesCatholic theologian Maguire, that "reflect a recognition that we haveoverestimated our right to kill in a military setting, and underestimated it insome medical and private settings."</i></font><p><p><p><br><p><br><font size=5>A</font><font size=3> motorcycle accident in June, 1973, paralyzed George Zygmaniak, agedtwenty-six, from the neck down. The indications were that the paralysis wouldbe permanent. George begged his brother, Lester, to kill him, saying he wouldkill himself if he could. Lester shot and killed his brother in his hospitalbed.<p>The case went to trial, and the jury, after deliberating for two hours andthirty-five minutes, acquitted Zygmaniak on the grounds that he was insane whenhe shot his brother. The jury also found that he had regained his sanity and hewas freed. In this and in similar cases, what the court produces is not so mucha verdict as a diagnosis. And a remarkable diagnosis it is, touching as it doeson the past, present, and future mental state of the defendant. The jury judgedthat Zygmaniak's past insanity was such as to excuse him from what wouldotherwise have been an act of criminal homicide. The jury then pronouncedZygmaniak cured, and the court, by releasing the defendant without further ado,underwrote the inference that his lethal illness would not recur.<p><p><p>In August 9, 1967, Robert Waskins, a twenty-three-year-old college student,killed his mother by shooting her three times in the head. When the policearrived and advised him of his rights to silence, he simply replied: "It'sobvious. I killed her." He was arrested and charged with murder.<p><p><p>Waskins' mother had been suffering from leukemia. She had at the most severalmore days to live. She was, however, in extreme pain and wanted to die. In factshe had begged her son to kill her. Three days previously, she had tried tocommit suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Both her husband andthe doctors witnessed to the fact that she was in deep pain at the time she wasshot.<p><p><p>The case went to court. The letter of the law had little to offer Waskins.Motive, however benevolent, is no defense in cases of mercy killing. Motive caninfluence the judge in sentencing, but the most lenient sentence in Waskins'case would be fourteen years in prison with no hope of probation.<p><p><p>On January 24, 1969, a jury deliberated for only forty minutes and with instantpsychoanalysis found Waskins not guilty by reason of insanity. They furtherfound that he was no longer insane and he was released. There is no psychiatricevidence that Waskins was ever insane, but thus the case was resolved.<p><p><p>In a famous case in New Hampshire in 1950, Dr. Herman Sander was charged withthe murder of a cancer-stricken patient. Dr. Sander had given the patient tencc.s of air intravenously four times and she died within ten minutes. It isreported that the patient asked the doctor to put her out of her misery. Thedoctor noted on the patient's chart that he had given her these airinjections.<p><p><p>The defense offered for Sander at his trial was that the patient was alreadydead at the time of the injections. The jury acquitted the doctor apparently onthe grounds that there was no proof that his action had caused the patient'sdeath. Thus ended what appears to be the first case in which a doctor in thiscountry was tried on the charge of euthanasia. Jurists who had hoped that thecase would set a precedent on the legality of euthanasia, however pleased theymight have been for Dr. Sander, were understandably disappointed in therationale of the verdict. The jury, it would seem, can scarcely be faulted. Thejudge had Stated at the very outset of the trial that the question of mercykilling could not legally be an issue at the trial. One wonders what could bethe issue?<p><p><p>Sometimes in cases of mercy killing, the evidence is simply brushed aside. Inthe Illinois case of People v. Werner, the defendant pleaded guilty to amanslaughter charge for having suffocated his wife, who was a hopelesslycrippled arthritic and had begged her husband to put her out of her misery.After hearing testimony from the family of the defendant regarding his devotionto his wife, and after the doctor testified to the excruciating pain and mentaldespair of the woman, the defendant was allowed to change his plea to notguilty. The court then acquitted him on the grounds that a jury would not beinclined to convict in such cases. The judge also observed that in this casethere was no likelihood of recidivism, that is, of repeating this kind ofactivity.<p><p><p>Resorting to reasons of insanity for acquittal in mercy killing cases is acommon tactic. This tactic would seem to constitute a commentary on the stateof the law. What is happening in these instances is that there is a flight topsychiatry when there is no help from the law. Such cases are not rare. CarolPaight, a Connecticut college girl who had been indicted for second-degreemurder for killing her hospitalized father who was dying of cancer, wasacquitted by reason of temporary insanity at the time of the commission of theact. And in Michigan, Eugene Braunsdorf won the same merciful judgment afterkilling his crippled adult daughter, who was spastic, mute. and had requiredhospitalization all her life.<p><p><p><p><p>The wheels of justice do not grind evenly here, however. In the same year inwhich Paight and Braunsdorf were so acquitted Harold Mohr in Pennsylvania wasconvicted of voluntary manslaughter for the killing of his blind,cancer-stricken brother. He was sentenced to from three to six years in prisonand fined five hundred dollars even though he also pleaded temporary insanity,and even though, in contrast to the other two cases, there was in the Mohr caseevidence that the accused had acted upon the urgent and repeated requests ofhis brother. Ironically, the judge in sentencing Mohr described the defendantas a martyr who must suffer the price of martyrdom!<p><p><p>As another example of the uncertain state of the law, it is interesting to notethe Texas case of Sanders v. State. Here the act of assisting someone to killhimself by furnishing the means of death is considered to be innocent of anycriminality. Then the Texan Court of Criminal Appeals went even further, sayingthat someone who "administered" poison was guilty of no offense if the poisonwere taken voluntarily. This would seem to give an open road to some forms ofeuthanasia in the State of Texas. However, in another case, the Texas courtwent on to say that anyone who administered poison by placing it in the"victim's" mouth was guilty of murder. In other jurisdictions, though, personswho mixed poison and made it available to incurably ill persons who wanted itand took it were found to be guilty of murder.<p><p><p>Beyond all theoretical questions of what the legal status of mercy killingought to be, two facts are painfully obvious about the way it is. The currentsituation is inherently unfair by reason of the unevenness in the judgmentsreached. Verdicts range from murder in the first degree to acquittal.Prosecutors, judges, and juries generally approach cases of mercy killing in away that contradicts the law as given. Devious means to circumvent the rigor ofthe law are the order of the day. But devious means are unregulated and in somecases the law in all of its conceptual rigor will be enforced. Thus theevenhandedness that a rule of law should ensure to create a sense of justice insociety is not in evidence.<p><p><p>Secondly, the way in which the law has to be circumvented would appear to meritthe epithet hypocritical. Judges and juries, sensing that the law as it standsis deficient, and being unable to do anything about it, declare the defendantdeficient, that is, insane. Pleasing as acquittal may be to the defendant,there is some inequity in his having to get the verdict he and the jury wantand believe to be just by the loss of his claim to mental health. The situationis all the more macabre since it is often clear that the defense of insanity isonly a gimmick used to make it possible to slip out from under the harshnesscommanded by the law but not by the facts.<p><p><p>The present categories of the law do not encompass the realities involved indeath by choice, that is, cases in which by omission or by commission one's owndeath or the death of another is opted for in preference to continued living.The kinds of death spoken of here are those usually referred to in popularparlance as mercy killing or euthanasia. The motives for these deaths arecompassion and an unselfish desire to bring on death when continued living isunbearable for the patient due to physical and/or mental suffering. Mercykillings thus described do not fit into any of the categories of unjustifiablehomicide available in American law. They are not murder in the first or seconddegree, nor are they a form of criminal manslaughter.<p><p><p>Murder is the killing of one human being by another with malice aforethought,either express or implied. "First degree murder is distinguished from othergrades of homicide primarily by the mental element known as 'maliceaforethought' or 'express' malice, and the unique characteristic of this degreeof murder is deliberation or premeditation--a design to take life" (AmericanJurisprudence). Thus first-degree murder is not something unplanned orimpulsive or the product of sudden and overwhelming passion.<p><p><p>In a mercy killing case, there is usually obvious deliberateness andpremeditation. The mercy killer has to plan to get the poison or shotgun orwhatever means he may use.  The immensely serious action, normally involving aloved one, will have been mulled over for a long time during the progressivecourse of illness. Mercy killings are usually clearly planned events.  There isdeliberation and premeditation aplenty.  But what about the business of"express malice"?<p><p><p>Here the court often turns to the classical definition by Blackstone: "Expressmalice is, when one with a sedate and deliberate mind, and formed design, dothkill another; which formed design is evidenced by external circumstancesdiscovering that inward intention, as lying in wait, antecedent menaces, formergrudges, and concerted schemes to do him some bodily harm."<p><p><p>Blackstone dips into motive here and implies (what should be obvious) thatmalice, in legal as well as in common parlance, normally imports some sinisterovertones in the agent's reason for acting.  Thus the idea of ambush,menacings, and grudges.  The conclusion would seem to be then that the mercykiller is certainly not eligible of the charge of first-degree murder since hismotives, be they right, wrong, or misguided, do not at all manifestBlackstone's or anyone else's "express malice."<p><p><p>Nonetheless, efforts are made to describe mercy killing as first-degree murder.How do the courts achieve this? How do they describe the "malice" of the mercykiller? In the California Supreme Court case of People v. Conley, Chief JusticeTraynor shows how it is done.  He observes that "one who commits euthanasiabears no ill will toward his victim and believes his act is morally justified,but he nonetheless acts with malice if he is able to comprehend that societyprohibits his act regardless of his belief."  What this remarkable descriptionamounts to is a nonmalicious sort of malice!  Blackstone stresses the qualityof ill will and spells it out a bit.  The courts which allege malice in mercykillings admit that there is no ill will. Indeed, in the case of Harold Mohr wenoted that the judge sent the mercy killer off to jail with the expressed andalmost admiring recognition that the man was a martyr.  One wonders just whathe was a martyr to.  Could it, perchance, be to the inadequacy of the laws? Arethere malicious martyrs?<p><p><p>And why does the law not employ this enigmatic notion of well-intentionedmalice in any other legal use of the term such as in cases of "maliciousabandonment," "malicious damage," et cetera?<p><p><p>When the law imputes malice to mercy killings it is indulging in theAnglo-Saxon penchant for confusing reality with legality. Happily for the humanrace, legality and reality do not always coincide. That is why wise judges areneeded to temper the shortcomings of the written law. That is also why theGreeks insisted on the virtue of epikeia, whereby it is reasoned that the lawis too general to cover every particular case and that therefore there arevalid exceptions which epikeia discovers. Epikeia discerns the primacy of thespirit over the letter of the law. It is the virtue that knows that the spiritgives life whereas the letter can be lethal.<p><p><p>To say that mercy killing is first-degree murder because it is premeditated andmalicious, and that it is malicious because it is against the law, is a nonsequitur. It ignores the possibility that this case is not covered by the lawas it now stands. It also lumps together all kinds of disparate cases. By notobserving the distinction between illegality and malice. It places Dr. Sanderwho dispatched his patient at her request to put her out of terrible misery ina class with a rapist who kills his victim to eliminate the witness. Both are,on the face of it, murderers in the first degree. Obviously, common sense, towhich the law is not immune protests. And, of course, the judges and juries whowiggle out of such judgments by gymnastic contortions are also protesting.Mercy killings may be wrong and because of this maybe they should be classifiedas illegal and felonious. They do not, however, qualify under the essentialrequirement of first-degree murder--malice aforethought." If they are wrong,another category and rationale must be found for them.<p><p><p><p><p>Murder in the second degree is characterized by "implied malice," which ispresent, for example, where death is caused by recklessness, but where willfuldesign is absent. Thus a murder charge goes from first to second degree whenthere is no deliberately and explicitly formed plan to take life or when theaction is not part of another felonious action, which other felony would, thelaw thinks, show enough malice to make the murder first degree.<p><p><p>The key then to second-degree murder is "implied malice," as opposed to malicethat is aforethought or "express." Some statutes define second-degree murder asa killing "perpetrated by any act imminently dangerous to others and evincing adepraved mind regardless of human life, although without any premeditateddesign to effect the death of any particular individual." Sometimes verbalprovocation will be enough to change the charge from first to second degree. Anexample of this may be illuminating and may help show whether we are in acategory suitable for acts of mercy killing.<p><p><p>"Where the deceased refused to withdraw the remark that defendant was a 'son ofa bitch,' by continued repetition of the remark in the face of the defendant'sstern warning not to continue with the name-calling. There was sufficientprovocation to merit a reduction of the charge from first to second degreemurder."<p><p><p>Similarly, the intoxication of the killer at the time of the act may have theeffect of reducing the crime to second-degree murder.<p><p><p>The first and obvious difficulty with fitting mercy killing into the seconddegree of murder is that we are still dealing with malice, albeit implied.Everything we said about malice above also applies here. Nor are mercy killingscaused by recklessness. They will be marked by considerable emotional strain,but they are caused by willful design.<p><p><p>Suppose, however, for the sake of argument that there is some kind of legalmalice involved in mercy killing. Would it be correct to say that it was of the"implied" kind? On the contrary if it is artificial to say there is expressmalice in these cases, it is also artificial to say that the malice is of theimplied variety. The word "implied" points to diminished premeditation. It isdifficult to imagine one killing out of compassion with diminishedpremeditation; the motivating compassion which leads the mercy killer to actwould also lead him to act only after intense premeditation.<p><p><p>Then there is manslaughter: "Manslaughter is a distinct offense, not a degreeof murder. It is an unlawful killing of a human being done without malice,express or implied, either in a sudden quarrel or unintentionally while in thecommission of an unlawful act" (American Jurisprudence).<p><p><p>If this sounds a lot like second-degree murder to the astute reader, let him beconsoled by knowing that many juries have been baffled by the way in which thelaw in word and in practice distinguishes the various degrees and classes ofhomicide. Voluntary manslaughter is that which is done in the heat of passioncaused by a sudden provocation. (Involuntary manslaughter is a killing whichresults from the commission of certain nonfelonious but unlawful acts withoutthe intention of taking life. Obviously, mercy killing does not fit into theinvoluntary category since it is entirely geared to taking life.) What then ofvoluntary manslaughter?<p><p><p>Voluntary manslaughter is usually a consequence of quarrels and combats. Itoccurs suddenly, without reflection or prearranged plan to kill. The killeracts "in the heat of blood." The things which would usually provoke this heatare assault, trespass, epithets, insults, gestures, and threats. The emotionprovoked may be anger, or resentment, or it may be fear, extreme excitement, ornervousness. For this charge to stick, and not be escalated to murder in somedecrees the courts seem to agree that the passion must not have had time tocool. The manslayer acts with all reason obliterated by the sudden provocation.There is no premeditation and no malice. Manslaughter is like an angry strikeof retaliatory, unanticipated lightning.<p><p><p>There are two reasons why voluntary manslaughter is not a suitableclassification for mercy killings. First, this charge requires that the agentbe impelled by uncontrollable passion arising from a sudden provocation;manslaughter is incompatible with passage of much time. The courts presume thatif there was "an appreciable length of time," there was premeditation. Thereis, it would seem, always "an appreciable length of time" in mercy killing.People do not usually gun down a relative upon the first news that he has aterminal illness.<p><p><p>All of the emotions cited in manslaughter cases are self-defensive incharacter. This is the psychological element that both anger and fear have incommon. The emotions and motive of the mercy killer are of another nature. Theyare marked by sympathy, concern, and anxiety for another, generated usuallyover a long period of time, in a context that is likely to generate strong andmixed emotions with the consequent need for adjudicating reason. Those whowould put mercy killing into the first-degree-murder class are on betterground, and, as I argued, their better ground is not sufficient.<p><p><p>In the second place, manslaughter, though it does not involve malice in thesense that murder does, is an action by which death is dealt without reason orjust cause. It is a lesser crime than murder only because of the distraction ofthe killer. There is, presumably, no just cause for ending a life. Mercykilling is based on the position that there may be a just cause for endinglife. This is the fundamental reason why mercy killing does not fit into anyone of the categories of unlawful killing.<p><p><p>In effect, American law outlaws and bans all but the most conservative moralopinion on mercy killing. Ensconced in our law is a discriminatory bias whichtakes no account of the legitimate moral pluralism which has developed on thisissue. Conscientious objection is disallowed. (Since the Supreme Court wasunwilling to give exclusive rights to more rigorous opinions on the disputedsubject of abortion, it would be interesting to see how they would rule on thedisputed issue of mercy killing. Even the conservative American MedicalAssociation, while condemning "mercy killing" and opposing legislative effortsto define the moment of death, adopted a "death with dignity" solution at itsDecember convention, stating that "the cessation of the employment ofextraordinary means of prolonging the life of the body when there isirrefutable evidence that biological death is imminent is the decision of thepatient and/or his immediate family."<p><p><p>Of course, there are apparent mercy killings which are immoral and should beunlawful. The patient may be done in for reasons that have nothing to do withmercy. This is why, even if our law were reformed to permit some kinds of mercykilling, the mercy killer would still have to prove his mercy.<p><p><p><p><p>Law is always interested in precedents, and the legal systems of other nationsoffer us a few striking ones. There have been a variety of modern reforms invarious countries, most of them stressing, in mercy killing situations, thesignificance of motive and the character of the action. The reform which wentfurthest is that of Uruguay. This law provides for complete exoneration in ahomicide case in which the act was motivated by compassion and performed uponthe "victim's" own request. As it was promulgated in 1933 it reads: "The judgesare authorized to forgo punishment of a person whose previous life has beenhonorable where he commits a homicide motivated by compassion, induced byrepeated requests of the victim." This provision is understood to be aconferral of power on the judges to offer pardon in these circumstances.<p><p><p>Germany does not go so far as Uruguay in this regard, but its laws are anenlightened move in the direction of reform. The German law follows the trendof modern European reform by stressing not the act so much as the actor. Thus,they are concerned not with a type of action such as killing, considered in theabstract, but with the psychological state of the actor, the killer. They wantto know the actor's character, his dangerousness or lack of it, the probabilitythat he will repeat his act, his motives. To get it out of the abstract andinto the concrete. German law even replaced the conventional terms "murder" and"manslaughter" with the personal terms "murderer" and "manslayer."Premeditation and deliberation are not looked on as decisive, since bothcompassion and villainy can be premeditated and the law sensibly recognizesthat compassion and villainy are not the same reality.<p><p><p>The German definition of a murderer shows the paramount importance of motive.Notice what a far cry it is from the confusion of "malice aforethought" ofAmerican law. "A person is a murderer if he kills a human being out of lust forkilling; for the satisfaction of sexual desire; out of greed, or any other basemotives; in a treacherous or cruel manner or by means causing common danger; orin order to make possible or to conceal another crime." Mercy killings are inthe separate category of "homicide upon request." These are indeed punishable,but with lighter sentences.<p><p><p>The Swiss penal code provides that the judge "may mitigate thepunishment...where the actor was induced to commit the act by honorablemotives." This, in cases of compassion, may lead to total exonerations. Swisslaw also provides that whoever ''from selfish motives assists someone to commitsuicide shall be punishable; if the motives are not selfish then there will beno punishment. This means that a physician who, motivated by compassion,assists his patient to commit suicide is not subject to punishment.<p><p><p>The law of the land--any land--always allows for killing as a legitimateactivity. No society functions without the recognition that life may beterminated for good reasons. Usually the laws mirror the mores of the populacein this regard, though at times they run ahead, and at times they lag behind.The kinds of killing indulged by American law provide a specimen of sometraditional and some not so traditional attitudes toward acceptable killing.<p><p><p>Americans are permitted by law to terminate life in four kinds of situations:abortion (because of the Supreme Court decision of January 22, 1973), capitalpunishment (though the Supreme Court struck down the death penalty laws ofthirty-nine states in Furman v. Georgia, nineteen states, not yet ready to firethe hangman, have restored the penalty), war (declared and undeclared), and, insome jurisdictions, suicide. What this indicates is that in some cases, such aswar and abortion (if one follows the Court in discounting the moral claims ofthe fetus in the first six months of its uterine life), man's moral dominionover death has been exaggerated. In other cases, such as death by choice in amedical context, no moral dominion is recognized. Particularly in war, thetolerance for killing is virtually unlimited. Long and destructive wars can bewaged by this country without the usual constitutional formalities such asdeclaration by the Congress. The powers of a President to wage war have swollenmalignantly. Dubious precedents are adduced to justify military crusadeswithout giving the people a real chance to judge. The worm, however, isturning. In the Indochina war it was deemed necessary to hide the facts of warfrom the people and the Congress in order to wage it. The mores, in a word, areless tolerant of war now than are the legal structures.<p><p><p>Also not reflected in the law is a major shift in attitude on the subject ofmercy killing. In a Gallup Poll the change of opinion since 1950 is remarkable.The question asked both in 1950 and in 1973 was: "When a person has a diseasethat cannot be cured, do you think doctors should be allowed by law to end thepatient's life by some painless means if the patient and his family requestit?" In 1950, only 36 percent said yes to this question. In 1973, 53 percentreplied in the affirmative. The breakdown of statistics also is striking. Amongadults under thirty years of age, the approval figure is 67 percent. It isnoteworthy too that only 46 percent of the Catholics interviewed said theydisapproved. Forty-eight percent approved and 6 percent were unsure, meaningthat not even a majority of Catholics voiced disapprobation of mercy killing.It is worth saying too that the poll was not taken without a context. Twostories were being highly publicized at this time, that of Dr. Montemarano whowas charged with giving a fatal injection to a patient and that of LesterZygmaniak who shot his brother, who had been paralyzed in a motorcycle accidentand had pleaded for death.<p><p><p>Thus there are shifts occurring in the general moral outlook on killing.Inasmuch as those shifts reflect a recognition that we have overestimated ourmoral right to kill in a military setting and underestimated it in some medicaland private situations, I believe the shifts are in the right ethicaldirection. A look at the four classes of legal killing will bear out mycontention that the law is lagging behind the times.<p><p><p><p><p>The moral discussion of abortion is plagued by the wrong questions. Though thewrong questions might accidentally lead to some right answers, they are morelikely to befoul discussion. This has happened in the abortion debate. Thefirst potentially bad question is, "Is the fetus a person?" The question ispernicious if it implies that if the fetus is not a person, it has no claims toreverence. Not only fetuses are threatened by the presupposition of thisquestion; infants are too. For if personhood and the distinctive, affectiveimaginative, and intellectual activities thereof are the foundation of respectfor fetal and infant life, fetuses and infants are in trouble.<p><p><p>All of the emotions cited in manslaughter cases are self-defensive incharacter. This is the psychological element that both anger and fear have incommon. The emotions and motive of the mercy killer are of another nature. Theyare marked by sympathy, concern, and anxiety for another, generated usuallyover a long period of time, in a context that is likely to generate strong andmixed emotions with the consequent need for adjudicating reason. Those whowould put mercy killing into the first-degree-murder class are on betterground, and, as I argued, their better ground is not sufficient.<p><p><p>In the second place, manslaughter, though it does not involve malice in thesense that murder does, is an action by which death is dealt without reason orjust cause. It is a lesser crime than murder only because of the distraction ofthe killer. There is, presumably, no just cause for ending a life. Mercykilling is based on the position that there may be a just cause for endinglife. This is the fundamental reason why mercy killing does not fit into anyone of the categories of unlawful killing.<p><p><p>In effect, American law outlaws and bans all but the most conservative moralopinion on mercy killing. Ensconced in our law is a discriminatory bias whichtakes no account of the legitimate moral pluralism which has developed on thisissue. Conscientious objection is disallowed. (Since the Supreme Court wasunwilling to give exclusive rights to more rigorous opinions on the disputedsubject of abortion, it would be interesting to see how they would rule on thedisputed issue of mercy killing. Even the conservative American MedicalAssociation, while condemning "mercy killing" and opposing legislative effortsto define the moment of death, adopted a "death with dignity" solution at itsDecember convention, stating that "the cessation of the employment ofextraordinary means of prolonging the life of the body when there isirrefutable evidence that biological death is imminent is the decision of thepatient and/or his immediate family."<p><p><p>Of course, there are apparent mercy killings which are immoral and should beunlawful. The patient may be done in for reasons that have nothing to do withmercy. This is why, even if our law were reformed to permit some kinds of mercykilling, the mercy killer would still have to prove his mercy.<p><p><p><p><p>Law is always interested in precedents, and the legal systems of other nationsoffer us a few striking ones. There have been a variety of modern reforms invarious countries, most of them stressing, in mercy killing situations, thesignificance of motive and the character of the action. The reform which wentfurthest is that of Uruguay. This law provides for complete exoneration in ahomicide case in which the act was motivated by compassion and performed uponthe "victim's" own request. As it was promulgated in 1933 it reads: "The judgesare authorized to forgo punishment of a person whose previous life has beenhonorable where he commits a homicide motivated by compassion, induced byrepeated requests of the victim." This provision is understood to be aconferral of power on the judges to offer pardon in these circumstances.<p><p><p>Germany does not go so far as Uruguay in this regard, but its laws are anenlightened move in the direction of reform. The German law follows the trendof modern European reform by stressing not the act so much as the actor. Thus,they are concerned not with a type of action such as killing, considered in theabstract, but with the psychological state of the actor, the killer. They wantto know the actor's character, his dangerousness or lack of it, the probabilitythat he will repeat his act, his motives. To get it out of the abstract andinto the concrete. German law even replaced the conventional terms "murder" and"manslaughter" with the personal terms "murderer" and "manslayer."Premeditation and deliberation are not looked on as decisive, since bothcompassion and villainy can be premeditated and the law sensibly recognizesthat compassion and villainy are not the same reality.<p><p><p>The German definition of a murderer shows the paramount importance of motive.Notice what a far cry it is from the confusion of "malice aforethought" ofAmerican law.

Though thewrong questions might accidentally lead to some right answers, they are morelikely to befoul discussion. This has happened in the abortion debate. Thefirst potentially bad question is, "Is the fetus a person?" The question ispernicious if it implies that if the fetus is not a person, it has no claims toreverence. Not only fetuses are threatened by the presupposition of thisquestion; infants are too. For if personhood and the distinctive, affectiveimaginative, and intellectual activities thereof are the foundation of respectfor fetal and infant life, fetuses and infants are in trouble.<p><p><p>Joseph Fletcher has written a somewhat unfortunate article entitled "Indicatorsof Humanhood: A Tentative Profile of Man." I say "somewhat" unfortunate becausethe attempt to delineate personal human qualities is at least a gainful ethicalendeavor. I say "unfortunate" because there are threatening implications in theair when Fletcher says that "mere biological life...is without personalstatus." That is potentially dangerous language because it implies too stronglythat fetuses and comatose persons, lacking humanhood in Fletcher's sense of theterm, lack a claim to life or are reduced to merely animal or object status.<p><p><p>Fletcher equates "humanhood" and personhood. He lists the qualities that arethe marks of persona, being. They are: minimal intelligence (anyone below theIQ mark of 40 is probably not a person), self-awareness, self-control, a senseof time, of futurity, and of the past: concern for others, ability tocommunicate with others, control of existence, curiosity, changeability andcreativity, a balance of rationality and feeling, distinctiveness, andneocortical functioning.<p><p><p>Applying these criteria of personhood to the fetus, it is clear that the fetusis not a person. But what conclusion would be drawn from that? Is it meretissue or a negligible maternal growth? Could it be plucked like a flower forlittle or no reason? Is the question of personhood, in other words, ethicallydecisive? The question "Is the fetus a person?" sometimes implies this. It isthen a bad question.<p><p><p>By way of correction, I would say that the fetus is not a person, but that doesnot answer the question about whether it is moral to abort it. The conceptusfrom the very beginning is a human reality. From the first moment of itsexistence it is in a process toward personhood. In a situation of conflictabout values, there may be proportionate reason to terminate fetal life, butnot because this fetal life is valueless or worthless. Rather, it is valuablebut not so absolutely valuable that no other value--principally, the life ofthe mother-- could ever outweigh it in the unavoidable and sometimes tragiccalculus of ethics.<p><p><p>The ethical consideration of abortion must be prejudiced in favor of the fetus.It is mute, and the other competing claimants of value are loud and articulate.They also might, at times, have a better claim, but the fetus' case must bepleaded forcefully in each contest of values with the recognition that its casegrows stronger each day it matures in the womb.<p><p><p><p><p>Capital punishment is, in a way, a species of killing the incurable. A judgmentis made that the person who has committed certain kinds  of crimes is, morally,a terminal case and so he is killed. Of course, no supporter of capitalpunishment explains it in this way. A variety of other explanations areoffered--self-defense on the part of society, deterrence of crime, redressinginjustice, and so on--but none of these is more than a rationale. Capitalpunishment, of course, has needed little defense. Throughout the years, it hasenjoyed enthusiastic popular support or, at the least, an imperturbabletolerance. It has also been spared acute and persistent moral criticism. Thequestion of why capital punishment has been so widely tolerated is anintriguing one. Yet the fact remains that only war has won greaterpopularity.<p><p><p>In recent years, the zest for capital punishment had receded. Executions are nolonger festive public events. This development, however, is shockingly recent.For example, it was not until 1868 that executions ceased being public inEngland. A. Alvarez, the author of The Savage God, feels that capitalpunishment, on the European scene, was a surrogate for the gladiatorialgames.<p><p><p>"In Christian Europe, executions replaced the Roman circuses. Criminals werebeheaded publicly: they were hanged, their intestines drawn out and theirbodies quartered: they were guillotined and elaborately tortured in front offestive crowds: their severed heads were exposed on pikes, their bodies hung inchains from gibbets....The execution was like a fun fair, and for the morespectacular occasions even apprentices got the day off."<p><p><p>No strained arguments about deterrence will account for the long and wideacceptance of penal killing. The roots are deeper than logic and are traceableto our primitive past.<p><p><p>Capital punishment can, I submit, be easily shown to be incompatible withminimal respect for life and consequently immoral. In support of thatcontention, I would offer these arguments:<p><p><p>(I) Capital punishment is suspect in its origins. Nicholas Berdyaev, theRussian philosopher, writes: "Capital punishment is rooted in the ancientinstinct of blood vengeance and human sacrifice, though it has assumed acivilized and legal form." He sees it as blood vengeance transferred to thestate, and he suggests that "vengeance is the chief moral emotion of ancienthumanity." Primitive tribes often believed that only by the shedding of bloodcould the debt incurred by certain crimes be satisfied. This was the meaning ofthe Jewish Goel, an avenging kinsman. The rule was simply this: "The blood of akinsman must be avenged by the death of the one who shed it, or, failing him,by the blood of one of his family." "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"was a lived-out maxim for a good number of our barbaric ancestors. In somesocieties this notion was heavy with superstitious content, so that the spiritof a dead man who died violently would roam tortured and discontented until theblood of his assailant was shed. This primitive notion was purely vindictivepunishment which had no interest in correcting or redeeming the malefactor. Hewas, rather, to be obliterated.<p><p><p>The history of warfare also shows some of these barbaric elements of purevindictiveness. The Roman assault on Carthage was one example of this, as wasthe practice of herem of the ancient Hebrews. The application of herem isdescribed in the Book of Deuteronomy:<p><p><p>"...you must kill all the inhabitants of that town...without giving anyquarter; you must lay it under ban, the town and all it contains. You mustgather all the wealth of it in the public square and set fire to the town andall its goods, offering it all to Yahweh your God. It shall be a ruin for alltime, never to be built again."<p><p><p>This kind of genocidal war was mitigated by the thinking that eventually becameenshrined in the "just war" theory. It became recognized that war shouldredress wrongs without going to the extent of annihilation. This represented alimitation of force and a move away from the barbaric thirst for the completeobliteration of the enemy.<p><p><p>Capital punishment represents a perdurance of the primitive lust forliquidating the malfeasant or enemy. It is untainted with the more civilizednotions of constraining the criminal or even converting him. On this countalone it is worthy of moral reprobation. But there are other arguments againstit.<p><p><p>(2) Capital punishment does not work. As one study of the effectiveness of thedeath penalty puts it: "Whether the death penalty is used or not, and whetherexecutions are frequent or not, both death penalty states and abolition statesshow rates which suggest that these rates are conditioned by other factors thanthe death penalty."<p><p><p>Murder is often the result of fright or other passion. It is not usuallyaccompanied by a cool estimate of the possible consequences. Also, it is doneby those who have no intention of being caught and having to put up with thelegal consequences. Small wonder that Justices Brennan and Marshall pointed outon the occasion of Furman v. Georgia that capital punishment is unnecessary forthe protection of the public.<p><p><p>(3) Capital punishment is not a form of self-defense. It is sometimes allegedthat the death penalty is society's way of defending itself from aggressors.What the death penalty should be compared with, however, is not self-defense,but the shooting of prisoners. The condemned man was presumably an aggressoragainst some part of society. At the moment of his execution he is an unarmedprisoner. Killing unarmed and unresisting prisoners is immoral. Even killing inself-defense is immoral if there are alternative modes of defense available.<p><p><p>(4) Capital punishment is unevenly used. In recent years in the United States,only about one out of ten men convicted of capital murder was sentenced to die,leading Justice Stewart to conclude that the death penalty is "wantonly" and"freakishly imposed."<p><p><p>(5) Capital punishment presumes the infallibility of juries and judges. Itleaves no room for correction of a miscarriage of justice. The fallibility ofjudges and juries, however, is a screaming fact of history. Juries, at best,provide a cross section of the wisdom, foibles, myths, and prejudices of asociety. No matter how sequestered, they are impressed with publicexpectations. They can be duped and befuddled by the double-talk of the law.They can be overly generous or blindly cruel. And if they err, the error, inthe case of execution, is incorrigible.<p><p><p>(6) Capital punishment bespeaks an absolute and demonic conception of thestate. If the state undertakes to kill persons in its custody when thosepersons have ceased to be a threat to society, the state is acting as if it hadan absolute dominion over life. It is presuming that it could sacrifice oneman's life to influence the behavior of other men. In essence, this action isarbitrary, despotic, and replete with pretension to a false sovereignty.<p><p><p><p><p>War is an enterprise which seeks to resolve conflict of interest by violence.It is a form of death by choice by which states decide to kill those who do notwish to be killed. It is generally accepted that war can at times be justified.There are few absolute pacifists. The problem is that we are so habituated towars and rumors of wars that we have justified war too facilely. We have, infact, tragically overestimated our moral right to wage war.<p><p><p>Violence is addictive; it affects the people who rely on it with the ecstasy ofthe "quick fix." Violence also tends to be escalatory. At the beginning ofWorld War II Hitler's bombing of population centers provoked expressions ofshock from England and the United States. As the momentum of the war increased,however, shock gave way to imitation. The Western Allies soon swallowed theirmoral indignation and determined that civilian morale and private property werelegitimate targets of war. The British Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, wroteto the British Air Chiefs in the spring of 1942:<p><p><p>"I wish to recommend therefore that in the selection of targets in Germany theclaims of smaller towns of under 150 thousand inhabitants which are not tooheavily defended should be considered, even though those towns contain onlytargets of secondary importance."<p><p><p>A Member of Parliament voiced his approval with enthusiasm. He declared himselfto be "all for the bombing of working-class areas in German cities. I amCromwellian--I believe in "slaying in the name of the Lord.'" These were notmere words. On the night raid on Hamburg of July 27-28, 1943, phosphorusincendiaries and the techniques of the "bomber stream" produced within thirtyminutes a fire storm several miles wide which burned or asphyxiated from 42,000to 100,000 people. Fire-bombing and attacks on civilians also became Americanpolicy against Japan. In the March 9-10, 1945, raid on Tokyo, 83,800 personsare reported to have died. Then, of course, followed Hiroshima and Nagasaki andAmerican consciences had grown so at ease with slaughter of populations thatthese unjustifiable attacks were borne with complacency.<p><p><p>The violence of war represents a reversion to the primitive notion ofcollective responsibility. The term "collective responsibility" can meansomething quite realistic and something that is ever in need of fullerappreciation. Peoples are responsible for misdeeds and culpable non-deeds oftheir nations, at least because of their mute apathy which allows the rulingpowers to sally forth into moral crimes on the international scene.<p><p><p>The term "collective responsibility" here is used to describe the primitivenotion that if one member of a tribe offends you. The whole tribe of theoffender is guilty. Anthropologist Robert Lowie gives examples of this:<p><p><p>"The sibless Hupa were content to kill any member of a murderer's family inorder to punish the crime among the Crow if a Fox had disgraced himself and hissociety by taking back an abducted wife, the rival Lumpwoods had the right tocut up the blankets of all the Foxes; and in the same tribe the grief of theparents mourning the death of a son slain by the Dakota was at once assuagedwhen vengeance had been wreaked on any member of the hostile people."<p><p><p>It is Lowie's judgment that this primitive conception is still operative inmodern societies. "Though this is an archaic notion," he writes, "it persiststo the present day in the warfare of civilized nations, which summarily shelvesthe practice of determining individual guilt or innocence." Lowie is both rightand wrong here. The primitive myth persists in modern war, but thedetermination of guilt is not a question that is dismissed "summarily" as Lowiesays. Efforts have been made traditionally in the just war theory to apply theprinciple of discrimination. Originally, when war was simpler, this principlewas translatable as the principle of noncombatant immunity. Kill-power had tobe focused on other potential killers only. In modern war a complicated lipservice is still paid to the principle of discrimination. In theory, an effortis made in "conventional" wars to be discriminating in the infliction of wardeaths. In practice, there is Lidice and Dresden and Hamburg and My Lai. Intheory, firepower is to be directed only at military strategic targets. Inpractice, many civilians are killed or maimed or dislocated. The theoryaccounts for civilian deaths with such clinical terms as "indirect killing" and"collateral damage." If in going after a legitimate target some civilians areindirectly killed, this is justified if there is proportionate reason to allowthe "collateral damage." This rule paints with a broad brush. It does not turnout to be very discriminating in application. In practice, Lowie is right.Risks are taken with the lives of civilians that would not be taken if theywere not implicitly caught in the net of collective responsibility. Policewould not go after a gang of criminals in New York City the way that we havegone after "the enemy" in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.<p><p><p><p><p>Whatever else it is, suicide is a common fact of life. About a thousand personsa day abandon life on this planet by way of suicide. In the United States alonethe estimate is from eighty to one hundred suicides a day. And all estimatesare probably low since many suicides are disguised as or mistaken foraccidents. Whether pro or con, persons react strongly to suicide, and manytheories have been advanced to explain this unique tragedy. Forbes Winslow, asurgeon, wrote in 1840, with confidence, that the increase of suicide in thatday was due to the appearance of "socialism." There was, he noted, a suddenincrease in suicides following upon the publication of Tom Paine's The Age ofReason. Not unaware of the complexity of the phenomenon, however, he went on tocite other causative factors such as "atmospherical moisture" and"masturbation." (He saw masturbation as "a certain secret vice which, we areafraid, is practiced to an enormous extent in our public schools.")<p><p><p>Cold showers and laxatives were seen as cures for the suicidal urge. It waspopular to believe that suicide was primarily the act of young lovers, althoughthe facts are that young lovers are not the most successful of would-besuicides. Others see it as a national habit that overtakes some peoples like aplague, and President Eisenhower opined that the high Swedish rate of suicidewas an example of what too much social welfare can do.<p><p><p>Spinoza said quite simply that "all persons who kill themselves are impotent inmind." And Aristotle, in his Ethics, described suicide as a failure in courage."To run away from trouble is a form of cowardice and, while it is true that thesuicide braves death, he does it not for some noble object but to escape someill."<p><p><p>Harvard Professor Edwin S. Schneidman sees suicidal purpose involved not onlyin some deaths but in most deaths: "The most important death category--the onethat I believe may be characteristic of a majority of deaths--is thesubintentioned death, in which the decedent plays some covert or unconsciousrole in hastening his own demise." As evidence of this Schneidman sees avariety of behavioral patterns such as poor judgment, excessive risk-taking,neglect of self, disregard of medical regimen, and the abuse of alcohol andother drugs. He notes too that "there is a notion that the speed at which somemalignancies grow may be related to deep inner psychological variables."<p><p><p>Suicide of a sort may also take place in large numbers through what somepsychologists call "victim-precipitated homicide," that is, homicide wherepersons have acted in such a way as to make their own death almost certain. Inthe same vein, Robert Lowell once remarked that if there were some littleswitch in the arm which one could press in order to die immediately and withoutpain then everyone would sooner or later undertake suicide. If some or all ofthis is true, then self-killing is statistically normal. Our question is, mayit be moral?<p><p><p>With Anthony Flew, I do not say "commit" suicide. That would imply guilt. AsFlew puts it:<p><p><p>"...If you believe as I do, that suicide is not always and as such wrong, it isinappropriate to speak of "committing suicide"; just as correspondingly if youbelieve, as I do not, that (private) profit is wrong, it becomes apt to talk ofthose who 'commit a profit.'"<p><p><p>A. Alvarez, who himself attempted suicide speaks of "that total lonelinesswhich is the precondition of all suicidal depression." He says too that thesuicide is "overwhelmed by his obscure and obscuring sense of inner chaos andworthlessness."<p><p><p>The professors Lester, in their book Suicide: The Gamble with Death, write:<p><p><p>"Suicide is far less likely for a person who has lasting, satisfactory,unambivalent relationships with other people than it is for the social isolateor for the person whose closest relationships are permeated with resentment.Loss of close relationships, whether by accident or by deliberate withdrawal,may serve as a signal to a person's friends that the danger of suicide isincreasing. Suicidal behavior does not occur without warning, and one of themost accurate warnings is found in the social relations of the potentialsuicide."<p><p><p>The very loneliness of the suicide constitutes a moral objection to hissuicide. We are social beings intrinsically and essentially. That does not justmean that we are together; it means that we are by being together. Our selvesare the counterparts of other selves and action to be human must reflect thatfirm fact of our nature. The decision of the suicide is lonely. It does notreflect man's communitarian nature. On that count alone, it is likely to be abad decision. The decision is, of course, related to people. Thus the suicidenote and thus the finding of studies that suicide is almost always signaled inadvance to someone. But the decision does not proceed from the interpersonalcontext which is the natural humus from which personal decisions, especiallyserious ones, should come forth. The good work that is being done by suicideprevention centers is trying to meet this need. Even telephone contact with acenter counselor helps people to overcome the crisis and opt for life.<p><p><p>The person inclined to suicide suffers from vision dimmed by pain. When we arein pain, our perception of other realities is minimal. We notice little of whatis going on around us. Partial vision leads to bad moral decisions. Thefruitful lives of many persons who gave life another chance or who attemptedsuicide and failed and later rejoiced in their failure indicate that thesuicidal decision is, by its nature, not bathed in clear light. <p><p><p><p><p>Many are the motives of those who die by their own hand. But in assessing thepotential moral meaning of suicide it is well to note that there is someevidence that suicide is often an act of aggression against others. Suicidenotes give evidence of this. These notes, in ways that vary from bluntness tosubtlety, sometimes show that the death is being used to inflict pain and guilton the survivors. "Mary, I hope you're satisfied. Bill." This is a shortexample of a not uncommon theme. It would seem calculated to vitiate themorality of the act in several ways. First, it totally subordinates one's lifeto an irrational need for spite. Also, it is, to say the least, cruel andunusual punishment.<p><p><p>Suicide also can be wrong at the level of foreseeable effects. First, there arethe effects on the bereaved. Studies are now showing that bereavement can be afatal disease. One must have extraordinary reason, therefore, to inflict it onothers. Dr. Dewi Rees and Sylvia Lutkins did a study of bereaved persons inLlanidloes, Wales, over a six-year period. During the first year ofbereavement, they found that nearly 5 percent of the bereaved die, whereas thefigure in a comparable group of non-bereaved persons was less than 1 percent.The death rate among widowers and widows during the first year afterbereavement was 12 percent, as compared to 1.2 percent of their nonbereavedcounterparts. If a spouse or child died suddenly outside the home or hospital,the death rate of the bereaved went up by a factor of five, due undoubtedly tothe suddenness of the shock.<p><p><p>Dr. Arthur Schmale considered a number of women who were suspected of havingcancer of the cervix. While they were in the hospital for a biopsy, Schmale andhis colleagues interviewed these women looking for two factors: had theysuffered a serious break in significant social relationships, and if so hadthey reacted to it with feelings of hopelessness and depression? If both ofthese were present, Schmale predicted that the woman would have cancer. He wascorrect in 75 percent of his predictions, both positive and negative. About onehundred women were interviewed.<p><p><p>Other studies have shown that such symptoms as insomnia, trembling, and avariety of physical and psychiatric disorders may come upon the bereaved. Againthe more sudden the death, the more likely it is that these disorders willoccur.<p><p><p>These are factors to be weighed by one contemplating suicide. Good moraldecisions are ones where the values outweigh the disvalues. Death may seem animportant relief for persons in great distress, but the question is, does therelief of death compensate for the problems that death will cause?<p><p><p>Also, in the area of effects, any suicide may have an exemplary effect. Thatis, it may encourage other suffering persons to do likewise even though theycould have overcome their problem with more time and support. All actions areimitable, especially dramatic ones like suicide. Each suicide may be aninducement to others to end their lives prematurely with much possibilityunspent.<p><p><p>Finally, suicide is arguably a wrong decision because of the presence ofalternatives. The human spirit can create and transform and because of this, itshould be slow, very slow, to admit despair. Man is a self-transcending animaland he has a native ability to transcend even the forces that move him towardsuicide. The suicidal mood, of course, does not give ready entrance toalternatives and that brings us back to our first point. The suicidal decisionshould not be made alone. Only the hardness of other persons can drive personsto the brink of suicide; only compassion and company can bring them back.<p><p><p>Having said all this, however, I must concede, "in a mournful mood" to useAugustine's phrase, that suicide may at times be moral. Even then, like war, itwill be tragic; but it can, like war, be moral. Generally, I judge, personsperform suicide because they have been stripped of the essential ingredients ofhuman life--hope and love. It would be naive to think that human perfidy is notcapable of depriving some of its members of these ingredients so that they cando no more and must depart. There may indeed be cases where all of thedisvalues of suicide can be outweighed by ineffable pain and aloneness. Inthose cases, it is the survivors who are to be morally indicted, not the victimwho seizes the only remaining relief.<p>Life is the good thing and the precondition of all good things. Any decision toend it in any context, for self or for another, must be slow, deliberate, andreverential. But the life that is good also bears the mark of the tragic. Theseare times when the ending of life is the best that life offers. Moral man willsee this, and then, more than ever, he will know the full price of freedom.<p></blockquote><p><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1974 by Daniel C.

Political leadersand reformers of many persuasions have invoked this icon of American civilreligion. At a low point of the Vietnam War, President Richard Nixon engagedanti-war protesters in a dramatic midnight dialogue at the Lincoln Memorial.During the civil-rights march on Washington in 1963 Martin Luther King Jr.stood in front of the memorial and began his "I Have a Dream" speech with thewords "Fivescore years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we standtoday, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as agreat beacon of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been scarred in theflame of withering injustice." Jacqueline Kennedy often sought comfort andinspiration in the Lincoln Room of the White House. "The kind of peace I feltin that room was what you feel when going into a church," she said once. "I usedto feel his strength. I'd sort of be talking with him."<p>	<A HREF="./lincind.htm"><img src="../../../images/shorsera.gif" align=left	vspace=10 hspace=10 border=0>	</A>Forty years ago David Herbert Donald wrote a penetrating essay, <A HREF="./lincrite.htm">"Getting RightWith Lincoln,"</A> that analyzed the penchant of American public figures forsquaring their positions with what they believe Lincoln would have done if hewere alive, or for finding Lincoln quotations that support their opinions. Andif the official Lincoln canon does not yield a genuine quotation, there areplenty of spurious ones to choose from, as Ronald Reagan demonstrated at the1992 Republican National Convention. My own experience with Americans'attribution of Delphic qualities to Abraham Lincoln occurred in 1984. After Ihad delivered a banquet address to the Lincoln Group of Delaware, I wasinterviewed by a Wilmington radio station. The first question the interviewerasked was "If Lincoln were alive today, what would he do about abortion and thebudget deficit?" (Undaunted readers should see <A HREF="../../95sep/abortion/abortion.htm">"On Abortion: A LincolnianPosition,"</A> by George McKenna, in the September <i>Atlantic</i>.)<p>The multiple layers of myth that encase the real Abraham Lincoln pose aformidable challenge to biographers--especially since most of what we knowabout the first thirty years of his life comes from the decades-laterrecollections of contemporaries which were gathered by Lincoln's mercurial lawpartner, William Herndon. But these problems have not deterred historians.Hundreds of Lincoln biographies have appeared during the past 130 years,including some of great distinction. In almost every decade at least one majorbiography has defined Lincoln for that age. In 1889 William Herndon and JesseWeik published the three-volume <i>Herndon's Lincoln</i>, which in many ways isstill the fullest account of Lincoln's early years. In 1890 Lincoln'spresidential private secretaries, John G. Nicolay and John Hay, offered theirten-volume <i>Abraham Lincoln: A History</i>, which remains the most detailedstudy of the presidential years and was the only biography until the 1950s todraw on Lincoln's personal and official correspondence (these papers wereopened to the public in 1947). Biographies by Ida Tarbell in 1900, LordCharnwood in 1916, William E. Barton and Albert J. Beveridge in the 1920s, CarlSandburg in the 1930s, and James G. Randall in the 1940s and 1950s enlarged andenriched our understanding of Lincoln's life. Most of these were multi-volumestudies; rare is the biographer who has encompassed the full story in onevolume. Benjamin Thomas did it in 1952, and Stephen B. Oates in 1977, both withverve and insight.<p>	<img src="./lincoln.gif" align=right width=200 height=300 hspace=10 vspace=10>Now David Herbert Donald, one of the most distinguished historians of our time,has added his name to the list of outstanding Lincoln biographers. AlthoughDonald has twice won the Pulitzer Prize for biographies of other men (CharlesSumner and Thomas Wolfe), it is <i>Lincoln</i> that he has in a sense beenpreparing to write during his whole career of half a century. Donald's firstbook (in 1948) was a biography of William Herndon, and he has closed the circlewith this biography of Herndon's famous law partner.<p>Eagerly awaited, <i>Lincoln </i>fulfills expectations. Donald writes withlucidity and elegance. The book moves between Lincoln's private and publiclives with a clarity that illuminates the connections between them. Donaldnegotiates the potential pitfalls for Lincoln biographers with surefootedgrace: Lincoln's relationship with his father; his romance with Ann Rutledge;his bouts of "hypo," which amounted at times almost to clinical depression; hismarriage; his political ambition; his attitudes toward slavery and blackpeople; his relations with radical Republicans during the Civil War; themistakes and successes of his wartime leadership.<p>On all these matters, and others, Donald weighs the evidence, navigatesskillfully among the shoals of apocrypha, myth, and self-serving recollections,avoids reductionism, and advances interpretations that mostly rely on commonsense as well as on informed insight. Yes, Lincoln had an uneasy relationshipwith his father, but it was not an oedipal rivalry. He probably loved AnnRutledge, but the memory of this lost love did not poison his marriage to MaryTodda marriage that had its good and bad days but was neither as smooth andfulfilling as Mary's partisans have claimed nor as tempestuous and barren asher detractors charge. Lincoln was politically ambitious and knew how tomanipulate the system, but he was more principled and less corruptible thanmost politicians of his generation. He believed slavery to be a moral evil butwas cautious in his approach to eradicating it. He shared the almost universalwhite-supremacy convictions of his age but rose above them during the Civil Warto promote the cause of freedom and take the first tentative steps toward equalrights.<p>Using the wealth of new material uncovered by the Lincoln Legal Papers project,Donald offers a fuller account of Lincoln's legal career than previousbiographers have. Although largely self-taught, Lincoln was far more than thefolksy country-bumpkin lawyer of legend. By the 1850s he had become one of theleaders of the Illinois bar. But Donald does not share the mistaken notion ofsome students that Lincoln was a "corporation lawyer." To be sure, herepresented corporations (mainly railroads) in several cases. But he opposedcorporations about as often as he defended them. And the bulk of his practicecontinued to concern small-scale property disputes, debts, damage to crops bymarauding livestock, and other staples of county courts in rural Illinois. Thiswould seem to make for dull reading, but Donald brings it alive.<p><font size=5>D</font><font size=3>onald is at his best in discussing Lincoln's politics. From the time Lincolnfirst announced his candidacy for the Illinois legislature, at the age oftwenty-three, until the Cabinet meeting on the day of his assassination,politics was rarely absent from his consciousness. He was a Whig, a devotee ofHenry Clay, whose "American System," with its emphasis on government supportfor education, internal improvements, banking, and economic development topromote growth and opportunity, attracted the upwardly mobile young lawyer.This philosophy undergirded Lincoln's commitment to what the historian EricFoner has defined as the free-labor ideology. Social mobility was central tothis ideology. Free men who practiced the virtues of hard work,self-discipline, and sobriety could climb the ladder of success. "I am notashamed to confess," Lincoln said, "that twenty-five years ago I was a hiredlaborer, mauling rails, at work on a flat-boat--just what might happen to anypoor man's son." But in the free states an ambitious youth knew that "he canbetter his condition" because "there is no such thing as a freeman beingfatally fixed for life, in the condition of a hired laborer." The free-laborsystem "opens the way for all--gives hope to all, and energy, and progress, andimprovement of condition."<p>It was the lack of hope, energy, and progress in the slave states, where mostlaborers were indeed "fatally fixed" in the condition of slavery, that made theUnited States a house divided. When the Whig Party died, in the 1850s, Lincolnhelped found the Republican Party in Illinois. The Republicans were determinedto keep slavery out of the territories, as the first step, in Lincoln's words,toward placing it "in course of ultimate extinction." "I want every man to havethe chance--and I believe a black man is entitled to itin which he <i>can</i>better his condition."<p>On this platform Lincoln was elected President in 1860, provoking the secessionof seven slave states (and later four more), which led the country down theslippery slope to civil war. More than half of <i>Lincoln </i>is devoted to thefour years and six weeks of Lincoln's presidency--which is as it should be,because those years were the most important in Lincoln's life and in the lifeof the nation. The Civil War almost proved to be the death of the nation. Butwith a genius for pulling factions together, a sure sense of timing, and adetermination to prevail despite defeats and despair, Lincoln led the Union totriumph and a new birth of freedom. Donald tells this story superbly. Hisanalysis of the complex interplay of factions, parties, and personalities inthe political conduct of the Union war effort is unexcelled.<p>Donald is on less sure ground in his discussion of Lincoln as commander inchief. He devotes proportionately less time to this function than Lincolnhimself did. After all, Lincoln was a war President. He was the only Presidentin American history whose presidency was almost completely bounded by war.Military matters probably took up as much of his time and attention as didpolitical affairs--perhaps more. He spent more time in the War Departmenttelegraph office than anywhere else except the White House itself. He leftWashington no fewer than eleven times to visit the Army of the Potomac at thefront, spending a total of forty-two days with the Army. Donald chroniclesthese activities, and includes a good analysis of Lincoln's concept of militarystrategy, but these pages do not sparkle as brightly as those on politics,personalities, and the emancipation issue.<p>Donald's grasp of military matters is sometimes a bit shaky. He has the datesof several battles slightly wrong, and confuses the Army of the Tennessee withthe Army of the Cumberland. The Union Navy did not "batter Charleston torubble"; Union troops at the Battle of Monocacy did not consist mainly of"green hundred-day volunteers"; there were never anywhere near 200,000Confederate prisoners of war "languishing in Northern prisons" at any time;Benjamin Butler's assignment to command the Army of the James was hardly "adead-end job"--Butler had a real chance to capture Richmond in May of 1864, butbungled it. Donald underrates the remarkable string of Union victories in thewinter and spring of 1862. His assertion that "in the winter of 1863-1864 the[military] outlook for the Lincoln administration was bad" is about 180 degreesoff the mark. Seldom in the war had the outlook been brighter. It was, afterall, a <i>Southern </i>diarist, the Confederate War Department official R.G.H.Kean, who lamented during that bleak Confederate winter: "I have never actuallydespaired of the cause. . . . [but now] steadfastness is yielding to a sense ofhopelessness." Or, as the famous South Carolina diarist Mary Boykin Chesnutwrote in December of 1863, "Gloom and unspoken despondency hang like a palleverywhere." And what is one to make of Donald's assertions that Manassas was"an undistinguished Southern crossroads" and that Nashville "had no strategicvalue"? These statements would have puzzled strategic planners, who understoodthat the rail junction at Manassas was a key to military operations in northernVirginia and that Nashville served the same function in middle Tennesseenot tomention its strategic and psychological importance as an industrial center andthe first Confederate state capital to fall.<p><font size=5>I</font><font size=3>n a frontispiece quotation and in his preface Donald sets forth what heintends to be the central theme of the biography. The quotation comes from anApril, 1864, letter from Lincoln to a Kentucky Unionist, in which the Presidentwrote, "I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that eventshave controlled me." This statement, Donald writes, illustrates "a basic traitof character evident throughout Lincoln's life: the essential passivity of hisnature." Elsewhere Donald speaks of Lincoln's "fatalism," his "reluctance totake the initiative and make bold plans," adding that "he preferred to respondto the actions of others." One of Lincoln's favorite Shakespeare passages wasfrom Hamlet:<br><blockquote>There's a divinity that shapes our ends,<br>Rough-hew them how we will.</blockquote>As the suffering and death of the war grew to monstrous proportions, Lincolncame to believe that man was helpless to alter the course of events predestinedby God. This belief achieved its most eloquent expression in the SecondInaugural Address.<p><blockquote>The Almighty has His own purposes. <br>. . . Fondly do we hope--fervently do wepraythat this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God willsthat it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man'stwo hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until everydrop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with thesword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said "thejudgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether."</blockquote><p>It is one thing to recognize that the stress and pain of a terrible war wouldcause Lincoln, or anyone else in a like position, to search for the meaning ofsuch trauma in the divine will. It is quite another to construct aninterpretation around a theme of passivity. As Lincoln himself might have said,that "won't scour." To begin with, one might ask how it squares with Lincoln's"unquenchable ambition"--another theme in this biography. Lincoln's letter tothe Kentucky Unionist should not be taken at face value. His purpose was todeflect the bitterness of Kentucky slaveholders who regarded the expansion ofUnion war aims to include emancipation as a betrayal of Lincoln's originalpledge to fight only to restore the Union. Don't blame me, Lincoln was saying.I don't control events. It is God's will, not mine, that has made slavery avictim of this war. Lincoln probably did believe that it was God's will. But healso believed in the adage that God helps those who help themselves. Hisdecision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was not a sign of passivity.Nor was his insistence that the Republican platform on which he ran forre-election in 1864 contain a plank calling for a constitutional amendment toabolish slavery. Nor were his decisions to sack failing generals but to stickwith Ulysses S. Grant despite enormous pressures to sack <i>him </i>in early1863.<p>At the very outset of his presidency Lincoln demonstrated traits that were theopposite of what Donald calls "his essentially passive personality." When someRepublicans flirted with the idea of endorsing the Crittenden Compromise, whichcontravened the Republican platform on which Lincoln had been elected, thePresident-elect stiffened their backbones. "Entertain no proposition for acompromise in regard to the <i>extension </i>of slavery," he wrote to them. Thevery notion of such a compromise "acknowledges that slavery has equal rightswith liberty, and surrenders all we have contended for." "We have just carriedan election on principles fairly stated to the people. Now we are told inadvance, the government shall be broken up, unless we surrender to those wehave beaten. . . . If we surrender, it is the end of us. . . . They will repeatthe experiment upon us <i>ad libitum</i>."<p>Having defeated compromise in January of 1861, Lincoln two months later faced adecision whether or not to yield to Confederate demands that he withdraw U.S.troops from Fort Sumter. It was a decision for peace or war. It was also, inLincoln's mind, a decision whether to give up the Union or fight for it. Hemade the lonely decision, opposed initially by most of his Cabinet and by otheradvisers, to fight for it if necessary. But in a brilliant move he offered onlyto resupply the Sumter garrison without reinforcing it, thus placing the burdenof deciding for peace or war on Jefferson Davis's shoulders. If Davis allowedthe supplies to go in, Lincoln would score an important symbolic pointasserting national sovereignty. If Davis fired on the supply ships or on FortSumter, the responsibility for starting the war would be his. And the warcame.<p>Donald somehow manages to find in Lincoln's handling of the Sumter crisisevidence of his "essential passivity." More convincing is the conclusion towhich Nicolay and Hay came: that with his plan to resupply the fort Lincolnmade himself "master of the situation . . . master if the rebels hesitated orrepented, because they would thereby forfeit their prestige with the South;master if they persisted, for he would then command a united North."<p>To be fair, Donald is too good a historian to ride the passivity thesisroughshod over the evidence in most cases. As he lays out the story ofLincoln's leadership during the war, with all its ups and downs, its successesand failures, the reader gains a clear impression more of mastery than ofpassivity. And Donald can quote with approval an entry from John Hay's diary inAugust of 1863: The President<p><blockquote>is managing this war, the draft, foreign relations, and planning areconstruction of the Union, all at once. I never knew with what tyrannousauthority he rules the Cabinet, till now. The most important things he decidesand there is no cavil.</blockquote>Recognizing that the facts mostly do not fit the passivity thesis, Donaldwisely allows it to fade away as the book proceeds.<p>In one important respect, however, Lincoln was fatalistic about events heperceived as beyond his control. Despite a number of death threats, thePresident refused to sanction elaborate security arrangements andphilosophically accepted the possibility of assassination. "It would never do,"he said, "for a President to have guards with drawn sabres at his door, as ifhe fancied he were . . . an emperor." Such precautions were useless anyway: "aconspiracy to assassinate, if such there were, could easily obtain a pass tosee me for any one or more of its instruments." So when Lincoln went to Ford'sTheater on April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth was able to enter his box becausethe guard on duty had moved away from the door to see the play.<p>In his preface Donald forswears the role of omniscient author. His perspectivewill be limited to Lincoln's perspective: "what he knew, when he knew it, andwhy he made his decisions." It is an effective device. As good as his word,Donald ends the book at the moment of Lincoln's death, when Secretary of WarEdwin M. Stanton intoned, "Now he belongs to the ages." Readers must draw themoral and meaning of Lincoln's life for themselves. Thanks to Donald'sscholarship and literary skill, they can readily do so. </blockquote><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

These, and other historical fragments,have been worked over and presented so repeatedly that sometimes we forget howreally meagre are the underlying data. In the winter of 1909 I came intopossession of an entirely new source of information concerning Lincoln'sboyhood. In a remote corner of the Ozark Mountains in Arkansas, I found a manwhose mother, a cousin of Lincoln, had passed her childhood with him in hisfather's family, and had preserved a store of family history, tradition, andanecdote concerning those early years. Since that time I have intended to makethis information public, but the nomadic and very busy life of a civil engineerhas heretofore prevented.<p><p><p>The family of Thomas Lincoln, father of Abraham, while in their Indiana home,consisted of his two children, Abraham and Sarah, and a flock of orphaned, orpartly orphaned, children from at least four different families. Among thesewas a niece, Sophie Hanks, just a month younger than Abraham, who lived in thefamily of Thomas Lincoln until she was married. The remainder of her life,except for a visit to Indiana, was spent in primitive Ozark Mountaincommunities, separated from the companions of her childhood. The records of herrecollections of Lincoln's early years and of the family life of Thomas Lincolnare very largely separate from and independent of all other sources. SophieHanks died in November, 1895, but her three children, living in differentlocalities in the Ozarks, have retained a part of the information they receivedfrom her.<p><p><p>Sophie Hanks's mother, Sarah or Polly Hanks, was a sister of Lincoln's mother.Though she never married she had six children, all of whom lived to maturity,bearing their mother's name. <p><p><p>The discovery of the family came about in this manner. The most interestingvacation adventures I ever have experienced have resulted from trips intoregions unknown to me, and without any specific destination. During the winterof 1908 and 1909, while engaged in planning the reclamation of the 'Sunk Lands'of northeast Arkansas, I spent one of these vacation periods on a short trip ofexploration in the Ozarks. These mountains as a whole are monotonous roundedhills covered with scrub timber; but there is one section in northwestArkansas, of perhaps a thousand square miles, not crossed by any railroad,where one finds canons with lichen-covered walls, steep mountainsides wherecedar, oak, and beech grow with a luxuriance not seen in more northernlatitudes, and where the mountain scenery will compare in beauty with anythingthe eastern states can offer. I had heard vaguely of the attractions of thisregion, had once before penetrated a corner of it, and on this occasion set outin that general direction.<p><p><p>The next morning found me on an Iron Mountain train, following the banks of thewhite River toward the summit of the Ozarks, with a ticket that would pacifythe conductor until about noon. Noon came, but, as the rounded, weather-wornmountain-tops seemed to offer small chance for adventure, I continued duringthe afternoon paying the fare in cash, a station at a time, hoping forsomething to turn up. Nothing did turn up, and when, about sunset, I saw astage awaiting the arrival of the train at the little station of Bergman, Idecided to rest my chances for interesting developments with this other mode oftravel. The stage was bound for the village of Harrison. That we were still inthe land of culture and refinement was evident from an advertisement by theroadside which read, 'When you get to town, take a bath at the Midway Hotel.'<p><p><p>The hotel was not disappointing, and neither was the rangy saddle horse onwhich I started early next morning for a trip farther into the mountains. Wepassed rolling hills with their groves and well-kept farms, and the little townof Gaither, a peaceful, sleepy burg at the foot of the mountain; then a longroad over the mountain, with a glorious view from the top in the soft graymorning; and finally down into the valley of Buffalo Creek.<p><p><p>That day on Buffalo Creek would have compensated for many a futile vacationadventure. There were sheer lichen-covered walls hundreds of feet high,sweeping in great curves with the bends of the creek; crevices and smallercreek valleys densely grown with cedar and hard woods; and here and there,perched in a cranny of the hills, a log cabin overflowing with children. Istopped for dinner at one of these. There were the great stone fireplace, thehand-made hickory furniture, hand-woven baskets, and puncheon floors, all areproduction, I suppose, of a typical English cabin of three hundred years ago;and there were archaic forms of speech which even in Shakespeare's day haddisappeared from all but uncultured or primitive communities. After dinner Isat for a time by the fireplace, talking with the father and telling stories tothe children, who had never heard of Mother Goose.<p><p><p>During the afternoon the road climbed upward, crossing the creek from side toside, and toward evening the canon was not so deep. Stopping at one of thecabins, I was informed that at Low Gap I could cross the mountain-range andreach another valley. Not wanting to retrace my path, I left the creek, and wasfortunate to reach the gap after nightfall, for a heavy snowstorm came on,covering the trails. The night was spent at a log cabin, where an Irish boyfrom Chicago was 'holding down a government claim' during his mother's absence.The next forenoon's travel was through another valley or canon, not so deep,but more picturesque, with many shady cliffs and little waterfalls, finallywidening to a flat valley, perhaps a mile wide, occupied by farms. Then, justbefore noon, came the little town of Jasper, the seat of Newton County,distinguished as the only county in Arkansas which has never been invaded by arailroad.<p><p><p>The village hotel at Jasper evidently was a residence, remodeled to care forguests. These consisted of the village schoolmaster, an occasionaltimber-cruiser, lawyers and litigants during terms of court, and at intervals atraveling man. Our landlady's husband served as physician--'practising physic,'he called it--for the village and for a large surrounding country. The peoplewere so abominably healthy, however, that in a tributary population of perhapsfive thousand, there was at that time but one patient, a case of chronicstomach trouble; so the doctor's wife helped out the family revenues by keepinga hotel.<p><p><p><font size=4><b>II.</font></b><p><p>It was the 15th of February, 1909, and on the hotel table lay a recent copy ofthe St Louis Globe-Democrat, with a description of the dinner given the weekbefore at Springfield, Illinois, commemorating the centennial of Lincoln'sbirth. The doctor apparently noticed my interest in this account, and whenconversation had become established, he made a remark which seemed to indicatethat he knew something of Lincoln. To my direct question he replied, 'Why, yes,my mother grew up with Abe Linkhorn. When I was a baby Abe held me in his armsand nursed me.' Further questions convinced me that here surely was a man ofgood intentions.<p><p><p>A snowstorm outside, and the fact that I had already made twenty miles overmountain roads and trails, offered sufficient excuse for postponing the furtherjourney until the next day; so, with the horse cared for, I settled down for anafternoon and evening's visit. As the doctor provided wood for the hotel andhelped in the preparation of the meals, our conversation was frequently broken.The schoolmaster, too, interrupted, expressing his scorn for so humble a sourceof information. Ida Tarbell knew all about Lincoln, he said, and had written itin a MAGAZINE.<p><p><p>The doctor answered questions willingly, but I found I did not know what toask. With but superficial knowledge of Lincoln's boyhood and family history,nearly all details were new to me, and the fragments of the latter were withoutspecial significance. When I left next morning, therefore, it was with thepromise that I might come again, and I resolved in the meantime to know moreabout my subject.<p><p><p>A second visit was made in May, at which time the doctor accompanied me byhorse and buggy to Limestone Valley, thirty miles farther into the mountains,where we visited his half-sister, Mrs. Nancy Davidson, and her husband. Shetold more of Lincoln and also allowed me to search through an old wooden chestthat had been her mother's. A letter in this chest from Dennis HanKs referredto another of Lincoln's semi-adopted brothers as having moved many years beforeto Douglas County, Oregon. Correspondence with all the postmasters in DouglasCounty located this branch of the family near the little town of Riddles. Mywife was about to start on a trip through the West, and stopped at Riddles,securing such information as was available from John Hanks, who also, in hisboyhood, had known Lincoln, A trip through the Ozark Mountains in Missourifinally located the doctor's half-brother, John Lynch, and his wife, in alittle cabin a few miles east of the old town of Iron Mountain. Mr. Lynch wasvery old, and while he fully substantiated the fact of his mother's early lifewith Lincoln, his memory was fading and he could add few new facts.<p><p><p>During 1909 and 1910 a search in the Congressional Library at Washington fordata concerning Lincoln's boyhood was followed by correspondence with thedoctor, and his remembrance was recorded touching many points of interest.Then, in July, 1910, on a third visit, we took a two days' trip by team andbuggy up Buffalo Creek. On this occasion a few remaining points were discussed.The doctor's wife is much younger than he, and has a more creative memory andwell-developed imaginative powers, capable of filling in any gaps which mayoccur in memory. The data furnished by her properly belong to a less limitedtype of narrative, and are not included in this account. I have endeavoredfully to recognize the obligation of historical accuracy, and have striven toavoid any unjustified appearance of consistency or precision in the account.All of the information, except as otherwise noted, was furnished by thedoctor.<p><p><p>The doctor is a tall, sparely built man, with stooping shoulders. In wearing ared handkerchief about his neck, instead of a tie, as well as in other featuresof his dress, he conformed to the customs of the Ozark country. He was born inDubois County, Indiana, December 26, 1843. In the spring of 1847 he moved fromIndiana to St. Francis County, Missouri. Before the Civil War he went to schooltwo or three months each year. During the war schooling was interrupted; butafter its close he had two years more of six months each. Then, from 1868 to1874, he taught school for seven months each year, four months in the publicschools and three months in 'subscription schools.' 'While I was teachingschool, I was studying medicine at every chance, and in 1875 I went in with Dr.Thompson as full partner in the practice of physic, and have been in activepractice ever since.'<p><p><p>Since 1874 he has lived in Jasper, Arkansas, until shortly after I met him,when he moved to Harrison, Arkansas, giving up his practice. As he left Jasperfor his new home, he forded Buffalo Creek, and threw his medicine case awayinto the swift water. For nearly half a century he had fought that mountainstream, winter and summer, in flood and during low water. He told me of wildnight-rides over the mountain trials, of his terror-stricken horse pursued by apanther that followed close by, but apparently did not dare to attack; ofmaking long detours for swollen streams, leading his horse along obscuremountain paths, skirting narrow ledges, or tearing through tangles ofundergrowth. Twenty or thirty miles from home these trips would sometimes takehim. On reaching his patient, he generally found a primitive log cabin, open tothe weather, absolutely lacking in sanitary provisions and lacking also inknowledge of cooking beyond corn-bread and pork and a few other primitivefoods. He was doctor, surgeon, nurse, cook, and often housekeeper.<p><p><p>The doctor and his family were independent people, living within theirresources and asking odds of no one. The doctor's father, although urged by hiswife to vote for Lincoln, refused to do so. John Lynch, the doctor'shalf-brother, also voted against Lincoln in 1869. He gave as his reason thathis father was a Whig, 'and you know a boy is usually what his father is.' Hewas a soldier in the Civil War, and nearly died there. He was proud that onlyonce did he ever try to profit by his relationship to the President. On thatoccasion he whipped an officer who had insulted him, and fearing that he wouldbe court-martialed and shot, he made known his relationship. <p><p><p>Such are the sources of our information. The new facts collected aboutLincoln's boyhood are not numerous. As important perhaps are the informationconcerning his father, and an accurate picture of the conditions of family lifeunder which he lived.<p><p><p><font size=4><b>III.</font></b><p><p>It is only by comparison with its surrounding that we can get a true idea ofthe character and the significance of the Lincoln home. The present-daysod-house of the far western Canadian home-steader is a self-respectingstructure, housing the family and reasonably serving its purpose underprimitive conditions. But if we compare it to even a poorly equipped tenementhouse in New York City, the sod-house, in its dirt and its lack of light, air,and sanitation, seems intolerable. The general conditions in and about the homeof Thomas Lincoln have been described with reasonable accuracy, but throughimplied comparison with different conditions of living, they have been made toappear exceptionally poor and mean. The fact seems to be that Thomas Lincoln inhis home life arrived at about the same stage of development as his neighbors.If the boy Abraham had grown up in any neighboring home, his habits of life andhis physical surroundings would have been about the same. Modern life has sweptaway most of this primitive culture, but to-day, in out-of-the-way regions ofthe Ozarks, are still to be found homes where Thomas Lincoln might drop in andfeel at ease.<p><p><p>Commerce, other than neighborhood barter, hardly existed in Thomas Lincoln'senvironment. The neighborhood was very nearly complete in itself, furnishingits own food, cloth, shoes, and farm-equipment. There being no market for corn,there was little incentive to raise more than could be used at home. Thisspirit still lingers in out-of-the-way places, where, in response to thequestion, 'How much corn did you raise this year?' I frequently have receivedthe answer, 'We raised plenty of corn,' or 'All the corn that we need.' Thedoctor spoke of the gratification in the early days over an extra large crop,its significance being that it would not be necessary to raise so much thefollowing year. With little to buy, and with still less to sell, theenvironment seemed to furnish small stimulus to commercial ambition. <p><p><p>Many people have asked how it could come to pass that Lincoln, growing up in amean environment, and lacking culture and education, could become 'the firstAmerican,' and interpreter of democracy to all the world. As a primaryessential, he was of sound stock, and had great personal capacity. But that wasnot all. Very generally, American public men before Lincoln had grown up in theenvironment of slave and free, master and servant, employer and employee, richand poor, aristocrat and plebeian. How many of them were born and bredaristocrats, trying to interpret democracy to America? But Lincoln grew up in ademocracy. The economic equality of his boyhood neighbors would satisfy anadvanced social revolutionist to-day. None were rich, and none without food andshelter. If one man worked for another, it was to accumulate a stake, that hemight soon become independent. It was not necessary for Abraham Lincoln out ofhis mind to create a new conception of democracy. He grew up in a democracy,observed it, and appreciated it, and then lived and spoke what was in hisheart. As a man, he did his best to do away with the physical limitations ofthis boyhood environment by the building of roads and by encouraging industry,while at the same time endeavoring to retain equality of opportunity. He didnot confuse primitive living with democracy. The primitive environment ofLincoln's boyhood strongly favored this economic equality. The country wasnewly settled by vigorous, adventurous men, who had brought little or noproperty with them. There had not been time for separation of those of greaterand less natural ability. There were no immediate traditions of aristocracy orof servitude. The lack of transportation, of markets, and of cities preventedthe accumulation of wealth, while free land, free fuel and building material,and abundance of wild game, prevented poverty from being acute. Everyone had towork for a living, and everyone could get a living by working.<p><p><p>Venison was abundant, but was considered too 'dry' to be palatable, unlesscooked with plenty of pork. Potatoes were not a common food, though they wereoccasionally raised. As Lincoln's neighbors were not aware that they could begathered and stored for winter use, they were dug from time to time as theywere used, until they froze or rotted in the ground. Very few vegetables wereknown. Wild berries and, after some years, apples and peaches were availableduring their seasons, but there was no knowledge of canning or preserving bymodern methods. Black-berries and peaches were preserved in the alcohol causedby their own fermentation, and sometimes apples were sliced and strung onstrings to dry in the sun. Very little wheat was raised, as it had to be cutwith a scythe, threshed with a flail, and carried to some small water-power forgrinding. Corn-meal was made by grinding on hand burrs at home, and later atthe water-mills that were built on small streams all through the country. A fewof the most prosperous people kept milk-cows. During the fall, when hogs werefattening on nuts and acorns, pork was abundant. At other seasons there werewild turkey, bear, venison, coon, squirrels, and ground-hogs. Coffee was rare.The doctor's mother used to tell him of 'the first coffee she ever saw. Her andAbe was at Uncle Jimmie Gentry's, and they didn't know what it was.'<p><p><p>Clothes were as simple as the food. As the doctor related, 'Abe, after he wasfourteen years old, had a pair of leather pants made from deer-hides. All theshoes they had were made at home from home-dried hides, one pair a year, andthey came along about Christmas. Abe, after he was grown up, had a shirt ofhome-made linen, dyed with walnut bark.'<p><p><p>In reply to my direct question whether the recorded statements of 'Uncle Tom's'shiftlessness were true, the doctor replied, 'Well, you see, he was like theother people in that country. None of them worked to get ahead. They wasn't nomarket for nothing unless you took it across two or three states. The peopleraised just what they needed.'<p><p><p>John Hanks in Oregon expressed himself very strongly as to the comparativestatus of Thomas Lincoln. He held that 'Uncle Tom' was not poor as comparedwith his neighbors, but that along with them he lived under primitiveconditions.<p><p><p>Not only did Thomas Lincoln meet the usual social and commercial standard ofsuccess, but in two instances he gave evidence of aspiring to a larger lifethan his neighborhood afforded. The first case was his effort to bring with hima boat-load of whiskey from Kentucky to Indiana. The doctor related this storysubstantially as it is given in other sources. 'Uncle Tom went ahead of thefamily with a boat-load of whiskey. He had several barrels. On the way downRolling Fork, I believe it was' (on other occasions the doctor called thisRoaring Fork and Little Fork), 'his boat upset and he came nigh losing all ofhis whiskey. He did not lose it all.'<p><p><p>On a later date, after the death of Nancy Hanks Lincoln, and before ThomasLincoln married a second time, he tried again to break into a larger field ofactivity. To use the doctor's words, 'Uncle Tom left his trade and thought hewould go into the speculatin' business. He made him a flat boat, and bought aload of pork--mostly on time. Pork was cheap them days. The hogs fattened onmast' (nuts and acorns), 'and didn't cost them nothing. He started down thePatocah, and then down the Ohio. He got way down there somewhere by Devil'sIsland, and his flat boat upset and he lost everything, and pretty nigh gotdrowned himself. He didn't have no boat to come back with, and so he came backup the river on foot, all the way. Then he went to work at his trade again, andpaid up all his debt.'<p><p><p>The fact that Thomas Lincoln paid his debts after this experience, a laborwhich required several years, was repeatedly impressed upon me during myvarious visits with the doctor. The family traditions are colored throughoutwith a high regard for Thomas Lincoln's character, for his patience, kindnessof heart, and honesty, and his finer sensibilities. Frequent reference was madeto his consideration in disciplining his children. 'Uncle Tom would not whipAbe or scold him before folk, but he would take him by himself and tend to himafter they was gone. People in them days believed that whipping was good forchildren. Ma said she must have been pretty good, because she never gotreproved or scolded very much.'<p><p><p>The doctor outlined Thomas Lincoln's calling in this manner. 'Uncle Tom was awheelwright. In them days it was a pretty good trade. You see, in them daysevery family had to have a big spinning-wheel and a little wheel. Uncle Tommade the little wheels. In a family where there were several girls they hadsometimes three or four wheels.' The doctor's sister gave a similar account,drawing particular attention to the fact that Uncle Tom was a maker of 'littlewheels.'<p><p><p>Perhaps a year after the death of Nancy Hanks Lincoln, Thomas Lincoln made ashort trip to Kentucky, and while there married a widow, a Mrs. Johnson.'Mother said she was his old sweetheart, before he ever saw Nancy Hanks,'related the doctor. 'When he went back, I guess he had her in view. When he gotthere she was washing in the yard. He went along just like he was walking by,and leant up against the fence and talked to her. He proposed marriage, and shesaid, "I owe too much." "How much?" Uncle Tom asked her, and she replied, "Twodollars and a half." Uncle Tom volunteered, "If that's all, I'll pay that"; andthe match was made up right there. I've heard mother laughing about that many atime.'<p><p><p>While Mrs. Johnson was lacking in ready money, yet according to the doctor,'She was right good for property. She had right smart.' And Uncle Tom broughtback, not only a wife, but a wagonload of her furniture. 'She inquired andfound out all about Uncle Tom, and how he stood in business.' In describing hispossessions, 'Uncle Tom told her all about the bed he had, how it stood so highfrom the floor on four corner posts, and had a top bent over so; an' he toldher all about it, like it was a wonderful bed. And I have heerd mother tellabout when his new wife saw that bed. She stood there in the doorway and lookedand looked at it, and then she laughed. She said everything Uncle Tom had toldher was true, but she thought it was some fine bed, and it was only a hickoryone he had made himself. An' the fine top was a hickory pole that come up frombehind the bed, an' he had bent it over and bored a hole in the wall and put itthrough the hole. You see, he was a wheelwright, and could do good work at suchthings.'<p><p><p>'Mother told me many times,' said the doctor, 'about the first house Uncle Tombuilt when he came to Indiana. It was a three-cornered house, made out of threerows of logs, with a fireplace in one corner.' He lived just through the winterin this shanty. In talking about it, he called it his 'winter castle.' 'How Icome to know what kind of a house Abe Linkhorn lived in,' said the doctor,'mother an I was coming from Jasper to limestone Valley one night when we cometo a little house this side of Limestone Valley, and she made me drive aroundit. She said it was just like the house Abe Linkhorn lived in. Uncle Tom builtanother house afterwards.'<p><p><p><font size=4><b>IV.</font></b><p><p>Abe Lincoln's few schooldays were spent at a 'blab school': that is, one inwhich the children 'read out,' Chinese fashion, at the tops of their voices.During his boyhood nearly all schools in his neighborhood were of that type.Later the silent school competed for public approval. The supporters of the'blab-school' idea held that it prepared for actual life; that a child whocould master his lessons in such a din could think and read without distractionin any other environment. Perhaps the fact that most of these people had noplace to read except in a one-room or two-room log cabin, surrounded by largefamily, may have added zest to their partisanship.<p><p><p>The doctor's mother, Sophie Hanks, attended school with Lincoln. She rememberedthat it was a long walk, about three and a half miles, and that going andcoming Abe frequently could be heard 'reading out' in the approved manner, sothat he was audible at a considerable distance from the path. Dennis Hanks wentto school at the same time, though for a shorter period than Abe or Sophie.Sophie Hanks's knowledge of Abe's schooldays was limited to the period inIndiana, under the teachers Swaney and Crawford, During this period hisattendance never was regular, and he sometimes would be absent for several daysat a time. According to the doctor's sister, when Abe was small, 'just a slipof a feller,' he was 'to'lable lazy,' and did not like school. The doctorinsisted that Abe was not lazy; 'but he was easy-going.' He was a good hand atanything he undertook, 'but he didn't hunt work.'<p><p><p>The doctor had a version of Lincoln's discovery of a grammar. 'A school-mastertold Linkhorn one day that if he wanted to talk and write correctly he ought tolearn grammar; that that was a standard to show him what speech was right andcorrect. Linkhorn didn't know they was such a thing as a standard of speech forlanguage; and when the schoolmaster told him this, he walked twelve miles toget a Kirkem's grammar, and he kept it right with him till he knew it by heart.They wasn't anything in it he didn't know. Kirkem's grammar was putty near aleading grammar in them days. It was a good grammar because it explained thereason for everything.'<p><p><p>The tradition is that Abe got so he could 'beat the teacher' at his lessons;but the doctor remarked, 'I don't reckon he was much of a teacher.' It is alsoa part of the account that he 'tried to teacher every day.' But if he did notlike to go to school, he did like to read. He borrowed every book in thevicinity. Robinson Crusoe he knew by heart. 'You know that was an old fableyears ago,' added the doctor. Among other books Abe read were one or moreancient histories, a history of the United States, and the Arabian Nights.<p><p><p>The usual opinions to the effect that Abraham Lincoln was a sickly child do notfind support in the stories handed down by the doctor's mother, who grew upwith him. 'He was very firm and straight,' both physically and morally. He'grew up very early,' and was large for his years. Sophie Hanks evidently wasmuch impressed with Abe's physical ability. 'If they was anyone that was anexpert at any kind of athletics,' related the doctor, 'Abe could do it better.I've heerd mother say many time that Abe would stand flat on his feet and leanback till his head would touch the floor. I got so I could stand on a trundlebed and lean back till my head touched the bed, but I was always afraid to tryit on the floor for fear I would fall and hurt myself. It was mother telling meabout Abe Linkhorn that started me at it. One of my playmates got so he couldstand on the flat of his feet and reach backwards and touch the ground.'<p><p><p>So much for the noble example. 'He would stand on a corn-cob and turn enunderit.' I thought to take the opportunity to correct statements which have beenwritten to the effect that Abe Lincoln was fond of cock-fighting; but the replyI got to my inquiry was, 'Cock-fighting was very prevalent in those days, andAbe took considerable interest in it.'<p><p><p>He hunted a great deal. 'I remember mother telling about the first time hekilled a turkey,' related the doctor. 'He brought it home and told the peopleall evening about killing that turkey, and when he went to sleep, he talked inhis sleep most of the night about that turkey. The folks deviled him in themorning for talking about the turkey in his sleep.'<p><p><p>He did not use tobacco as a boy, was not profane, and did not drink whiskey'except as Uncle Tom would have all the children to drink a dram beforebreakfast for health.' John Hanks, of Douglas County, Oregon, remembered theonly time he saw Lincoln touch whiskey. It was at a bee-hunt. Lincoln mixedsome honey with whiskey, tasted it, and said, 'Den, that tastes pretty good.'His only recorded illness was an occasional attack of malaria. The nickname,'honest Abe,' attached to him while he was a boy.<p><p><p>Another commonly accepted belief which the doctor vigorously resented is thatwhich holds Lincoln to have been sober and gloomy. According to the traditionsof this family, he was just the reverse--bright, full of life and of fun, andvery talkative. 'He was quick to learn, forgot nothing, and always wanted totell what he knew.' The doctor repeated many times accounts of Abe's weaknessfor 'putting in' or interrupting a conversation when, in the relation of someincident, the truth would be departed from, or some item of the account whichhe considered important would be left out. 'And when the company would leave,Uncle Tom would take Abe and talk to him about "putting in" when older peoplewere talking.' This tendency to break into a conversation was mentioned asAbe's outstanding weakness.<p><p><p>He did not like girls' company, but was 'a great fellow to be with the boys.'He was known for good-nature, even temper, and for seldom becoming angry. Hewould go to all the dances in the country, but would not dance. Off at oneside, with the boys gathered around him, he would tell jokes and funny stories,and would relate what he had read. For their further edification he would turnhandsprings, stand flat-footed, and lean back until his head would touch theground (this last item was many times related, and evidently formed asubstantial part of the basis of the doctor's admiration for Lincoln), andwould perform many other athletic stunts. Sometimes at such dances, 'it wouldbe hard to get enough boys to stand for a set,' because Abe's company was moreinteresting. At wrestling, 'nobody ever throwed Abe unless he was a heap biggerthan him.'<p><p><p>The commonly repeated stories about Lincoln's reading by a fireplace at nightare supported by these family accounts. The doctor's sister said, 'I've heerdmamma tell about how Abe would gather brush of an evening to make a light withof a night to read by. He would lay down with his feet THERE away from the fireand his head THERE by the fire, and he would read a long time.' He was an eagerlistener. 'Whenever anyone was talking, Abe was right there.' He observedkeenly, and never forgot.<p><p><p>The self-reliance so evident in later life was not absent during Lincoln'sboyhood, as the following story indicates. It was at the time of ThomasLincoln's trip down the river after the death of Lincoln's mother, and beforeThomas was married the second time.<p><p><p>'When Uncle Tom went away, he left Abe and his sister and my mother there, andleft one fat hog in the pen. It was a big, fat hog. The way she said, I guessit would weigh nigh two hundred pounds. He said if they got out of feed, theycould go over and get Mr. Greathouse to kill the hog for them. Mr. Greathousewas a neighbor and a little o'kin. When the hog was needed, Abe said theywouldn't go get Greathouse to kill the hog. He said they would kill itthemselves. So Abe went over to Greathouse's when Mr. Greathouse wasn't tohome, and Mrs. Greathouse let him take the gun. He must have been a littlefeller, 'cause ma said, when she see him coming the shot-pouch hung almost tohis knee.<p><p><p>'Abe took the gun out to the pen, and pointed it through the rails,--so,--andtook aim and shot the hog dead all right. And then he and my mother went intothe pen and tried to take the hog out. But they couldn't budge it. So they wentand got some boards and put them down in the pen, and they had the wateralready hot, and they took the entrails out, an' cut it up right there in thepen, and carried it out in pieces. And they did a pretty good job.'<p><p><p>John Hanks, the Oregon relative, gave the very confidential information that'Lincoln was as much of a infidel as anyone could be. I wouldn't like to sayhow much; but he was good and moral.' When I quoted this to the doctor on alater visit, he replied, 'There was a sense in him that he could not narrowhimself to the religion of that time. In them days, if a man doubted the Biblebeing exactly true in everything, and if he did not believe in fire andbrimstone, he was called an infidel. Lincoln said he could take some thingsfrom all the churches and make a better church than any of them. If Lincoln wasan infidel, a good part of the people is coming to believe like he did.'<p><p><p>This family's knowledge of Abraham Lincoln fades away where our more completeknowledge of his life begins. Telling his story of how Lincoln grew up inIndiana, the doctor concluded,--<p><p><p><p>And then by and by Uncle Tom's other wife died, and he and Abe went away. Theywent to Sangamon County, Illinois, and Abe drove a pair of steers all the way.We don't know much about Abe's life after he left Indiana, but some of the menLinkhorn knew in Illinois has written things about his early life. And they hasmade mistakes. Some of the things they say is true and some ain't true.' Thedoctor recounted sketchily a few items of Lincoln's early days in Illinois.'And then Abe, he got the post-office over there, an' he got work in the store,and then bymeby they got him into the legislature. One of the first things hedone while he was a statesman was when they was a bill up to move the capitalfrom Vandalia to Springfield. The legislatures used to meet then at Vandalia.One day all the friends of Springfield was away, and they was a quorum and thesargent was there and wouldn't let anybody out. And they was goin' to passtheir bill while the friends of Springfield wasn't there. And Abe, he went tothe window and hung out and dropped about fourteen feet. And four or five otherfellows followed him, and he busted the quorum that way. But the time thepeople begun to find out what Abe was good for, was when he began to have themtalks with Mr. Douglas.'<p><p><p>Several of the places and persons associated with Lincoln's boyhood were moreor less familiar to the doctor. Concerning Thomas Lincoln's neighbor, Mr.Gentry, he said, 'My mother lived for a short time with him. He thought a sightof her and Abe. She never had a better friend. She always spoke of him as UncleJimmy Gentry. I think he was a distant relative, and was a good liver for thattime. It seems to me he kept a little store, but I am not sure. Gentry-villetook its name from him.'<p><p><p>The Johnson boys, sons of Thomas Lincoln's second wife, did not stand high inthe family estimation. Abe found it necessary to restrain his step-brothersfrom vulgarity and common coarseness of behavior. In case of dispute, Abe'sword was always taken over theirs. When these stepbrothers tried to explainthemselves out of a scrape, they frequently were confronted with the remark,'Wait till Abe comes, and then we will know the truth about it.'<p><p><p>When I asked the doctor about the various reports that Abraham Lincoln was anillegitimate child, he replied, 'Those stories about Abraham Linkhorn being anillegitimate child are untrue. Aunt Nancy and Uncle Tom were married regular.But his mother was an illegitimate child. I have always understood that fromwhat my mother said about it. But my cousin said that his mother told him thatour grandmother Hanks and Linkhorn's mother were half-sisters and also cousins.My mother never told me that, but I have often heard her say that we were badlymixed.<p><p><p><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../index.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>"New Light on Lincoln's Boyhood," from The Atlantic Monthly, February, 1920, issue.Vol. 125, No. 2 (p.208-218).</font><p></body></html>

	<i><font size=4>A small army of hunters struggles to control one of

Hawaii's most destructive exotic pests.</i></font><p>

	<font size=5>T</font>wo miles into the tree-fern forest of 'Ola'a Tract, Dan Taylor pulled the jeep

onto a grassy shoulder of the road. The macadam ran on straight and narrow,

bisecting the spring-green wilderness of fronds. The hapu'u, the tree ferns,

made a secondary canopy under a thin, much-broken primary canopy of ohialehua.

The secondary canopy here was continuous and much more impressive than the

first. It was as if some sparse Serengeti had germinated atop Amazonian jungle.

In the structure of their fronds, in the dark little dots of sori on the

undersides, the hapu'u looked similar to any number of fern species on the

mainland, but they were much larger. The hapu'u canopy formed twenty to thirty

feet above the ground. Ahead the straightness of the road wavered in the heat

and the far fronds trembled, as scenery might around a time machine building up

steam. We had left the twentieth century, the Big Island, and Hawaii Volcanoes

National Park. We had taken a chronological wrong turn, a detour into the

Paleozoic.<p>



<p>



On the left-hand side of the road, behind the wire fence, Taylor told me, was

tree-fern forest from which feral pigs had been eliminated. On the right was

forest where pigs still rooted and rambled. He led me into the right-hand

forest first.<p>



<p>



The light under the canopy was cool and green. The air was humid, the breeze

stilled, the mood carboniferous. Overhead, the backlit fronds interdigitated

with few gaps between, making a green tent of chlorophyll, but underfoot the

forest floor was broken by black, muddy trails and turnpikes. Here and there

the mud was firm enough to hold the impression of a cloven hoof.<p>



<p>



Taylor picked one of these trails and proceeded down it. Daniel Taylor is a

career man with the U.S. Park Service, a general in a war against the pigs. He

is a fair-skinned, soft-spoken man of middle age and height, his features

pleasantly weathered by a lifetime in the field. He came to Hawaii Island in

1979, from a post in Glacier National Park. Before that he worked in the North

Cascades, and before that in Yosemite and Sequoia. Today he wore his uniform

slacks and a pair of lightweight boots. I was barefoot, and the black mud of

the pig trail felt wonderful between my toes. In this matter, at least, I could

empathize with the enemy.<p>



<p>



"Rubus ellipticus, introduced raspberry," Taylor announced, fetching a vine and

bending it toward me. He gave me a significant glance. Moving several steps on,

we stopped before another vine. "Passiflora mollisima, passionflower.

Banana-poka, in Hawaiian. It's South American, a minor constituent of the flora

in Colombia, Bolivia, but here...It was introduced in 1952 by an imbecile. I

can't remember his name. Passiflora edulis is the passionfruit humans generally

eat, but pigs like mollisima. They love the fruit. They eat it, defecate, and

spread the seeds. The vine goes up into the canopy and spreads." Overspreading

the ferns, the vine stole the sunlight and took over the forest.<p>



<p>



We walked a few dozen yards and then, beside a fallen tree-fern trunk, Taylor

went down on one knee.<p>



<p>



"See? This is a banana-poka seedling. A whole bunch of them--" The clump of

seedlings made a perfect circle on the wet blackness at the side of the trail.

"--eight, nine, ten, eleven...eighteen," Taylor said, counting the legacy of

that particular pig. Without rising, he leaned out to brush another circle of

seedlings. The seedlings of this second clump were much smaller, having just

broken the surface. "Here's another generation. Eight, nine, ten...There goes

the forest."<p>



<p>



We walked on, Taylor sensibly avoiding the muddiest places and I, barefoot,

looking forward to them and squishing through the deepest parts.<p>



<p>



"We're looking desperately for a biological control," Taylor said. "Right now a

forester is working in Colombia and Bolivia, searching for one. But for the

moment there's not a damn thing we can do. I think this forest is doomed."<p>



<p>



We left the doomed forest and crossed to the other side of the road.<p>



<p>



Inside the pigless forest the fronds overhead interdigitated flawlessly,

leaving no breaks in the canopy. Where across the road the light had been cool

and green, here it was cooler and greener. The going was slow, because pigs had

not opened up avenues. Recumbent trunks and aerial roots were everywhere, and

making progress into the forest was like trying to run a race over hurdles

still stacked against the stadium wall.<p>



<p>



At intervals among the trunks of the tree ferns were trunks of ohia-lehua,

which ran up through the canopy to leaf somewhere out of sight above.

Occasionally one of the ohia stood on stilts.<p>



<p>



The ohia, a Polynesian myrtle, often begins life as an epiphyte on tree ferns,

germinating on the fern stumps or high on the trunks, sometimes twenty feet or

more above the ground. As a trunk-germinated ohia tree grows, its roots begin

to search for the ground, entwining their host. The tree fern, like a slender

lifeguard who has rescued a desperate matron more vital than himself, begins to

strangle. By the time the ohia's frantic roots have found solid bottom, the

fern has gasped its last, decayed, and disappeared, and the ohia is left

sanding on stilts. The surrounding tree ferns hurry to fill in the void left by

their fallen comrade--the tree fern's mission is to make a green heaven on

earth--and soon the secondary canopy is complete again.<p>



<p>



Taylor and I stopped and stood quiet for a moment, letting the silence of the

forest sink in. It was a closer, deeper silence than the silence across the

way. The effect of the green light was powerful and nearly instantaneous. It

put a part of the brain to sleep, that region concerned with projects,

ambitions, worry, war, death, taxes. It awakened another part, the region

concerned with things less easy to name: listening, waiting, half-surmise.<p>



<p>



"The key to this forest is the integrity of the tree-fern canopy," Taylor said,

perhaps having decided that the green light had primed me sufficiently. "If you

look twenty feet above your head, you can see that the tree-fern fronds

interlock, forming a subcanopy. The woody canopy above is very open, broken,

not contiguous. What really keeps the forest closed is that tree-fern subcanopy

twenty feet or so above the ground.<p>



<p>



"The canopy does a lot of things. It keeps the sunlight from penetrating

directly to the forest floor, except in a very few places--and there for only a

few minutes during the day. That keeps the temperatures down, keeps them more

even, and maintains a more predictable environment for plants. The humidity is

higher than in the forest across the street. The canopy breaks up the impact of

raindrops. These big tropical raindrops don't impact the forest floor directly.

What falls down here is a kind of mist. Atomized raindrops.<p>



<p>



"When tree ferns fall down, as they naturally do, they try to grow like this

one here." He pointed to the green python of a recumbent trunk lying at our

feet. "You see how this main stem runs along the ground, then suddenly takes a

right angle and grows up over there? Well, that's the way tree ferns

regenerate. When pigs are present, and that tree-fern stem is lying on the

ground, the pigs will come along and munch on it. They like to chew the starchy

interior of the stem. It's a favorite food item with them.<p>



<p>



"That chewing does a couple of things. It kills the tree fern, to begin with,

so there goes the canopy. The pigs also leave a hollow behind when they've

chewed on the stem, a trough in which water collects, and the water breeds

mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are not native here, nor is the avian malaria that they

carry. The native bird population doesn't tolerate the malaria very well.

Introduced birds do better. We think one of the major causes, if not the major

cause, of the decline of native forest birds is avian malaria. Pigs are

implicated in that as well."<p>



<p>



A generation ago Hawaiian cowboys, riding by a certain burial site in the

northern grasslands of the Big Island, were in the habit of reining in,

dismounting, and urinating on the grave. Buried here was "Mongoose" Forbes. In

the 1870s Forbes sold mongooses to the managers of Hawaii's sugar plantations,

on the grounds that this import from Asia would eat rats. (Norway rats had

jumped ship in Hawaii and were raising Cain in the cane.) The disrespectful

posthumous salute by the Hawaiian cowboys would have mystified Forbes. Like

most of those men who have introduced alien animals to islands, Mongoose Forbes

thought he was doing good.<p>



<p>



Exotic wildlife wreaks plenty of havoc on the continents--starlings, sparrows,

camels, and carp on our own, for example--but nowhere have exotics caused more

devastation and disruption than in the simple, sheltered ecosystems of islands.

Isolation from the rough-and-tumble of natural selection, mainland style, has

allowed islands to develop a wonderful, often bizarre, flowering of forms. In

Australia--a continent, actually, but so isolated that the island principle

applies--marsupials filled all the mammal niches: marsupial bears, marsupial

wolves, marsupial rhinoceroses. In the Galapagos Islands finches speciated to

fill a wide range of avian niches, and giant lizards went to sea to play otter.

Isolation makes islands into fine natural laboratories for scientists like

Darwin, and islands have given rise to some elegant theories; but isolation

also makes for vulnerability. In Australia the marsupials and the monotremes,

the two most primitive mammalian orders, were living in a fool's paradise. On

continents across the sea the placenta had been invented and had spread;

evolution had passed Australia by and Australia never knew it. The marsupial

wolf had a terrible shock when, for the first time, it saw a real canine

face-to-face. For many insular species the first encounter with the outside

world has been followed shortly by extinction.<p>



<p>



The new arrivals have the power to alter the very landscape. Real rabbits,

replacing the marsupial kind, accomplished that by desertifying vast stretches

of Australia. The placental rabbit, with its enormous reproductive potential

and its quicker wit, was a ninety-year plague on that island-continent. In one

year, 1887, twenty-eight years into the plague, nearly 20 million rabbits were

killed by the desperate inhabitants of New South Wales alone. Earlier the

"European" rabbit, moving north from its native North Africa, had overrun

Corsica, Sardinia, and the British Isles. Later it would overrun New Zealand

and the San Juans, in Puget Sound. In 1903, during the Australian plague, some

genius introduced the rabbit to Laysan Island, in Hawaii's leeward chain, and

Laysan was promptly reduced to desert; of twenty-six native plants known in

1923 only four remained.<p>



<p>



I didn't plan it this way, but my career has often deposited me on islands. The

problem of exotic introductions to island environments is one that has grown on

me. On Maui, across the channel from the Big Island, I have braked time and

again for mongooses gliding across the road. My instincts were wrong--I should

have accelerated. Some of those mongooses were out hunting rats, as Mongoose

Forbes had intended, but more were out after native birds and their eggs.

(Hawaii's avifauna, thanks to pigs, cattle, mongooses, mosquitoes, and men, has

suffered the highest extinction rate of any avifauna on this planet. In the

past few centuries approximately 40 percent of Hawaii's known native bird

species have become extinct. On the current list of rare and endangered birds

thirty of the sixty-seven species found in the United States were Hawaiian. The

Hawaiian goose, the Hawaiian duck, the Hawaiian coot, hawk, thrush, stilt, and

crow--among others--are in imminent danger of joining the Hawaiian rail, last

collected near the rain forest in 1864, the greater and lesser koa finches, not

seen since 1896; the greater 'amakihi, not seen since early in this century;

the kioea, the ula-ai-hawane, the mamo, the black mamo, and dozens of others

that have passed into oblivion.)<p>



<p>



In the Galapagos Islands I have tracked herds of feral goats that compete for

forage with the giant tortoises for which that archipelago is named. From hotel

windows in Britain I have drawn imaginary beads on the American gray squirrels

that have overrun that island, displacing the smaller native red squirrels,

barking and girdling thousands of good English hardwoods, and sorely testing

the patience of the natives, that most animal-loving of peoples. In the Palau

Archipelago of Micronesia, venturing out on dawn walks, I have passed armies of

giant African snails headed the other way, crawling back to the bushes after

their nightly depredations.<p>



<p>



The giant African snail, Achatina fulica, grows nearly to the size of a

football and can weigh more than a pound. Introduced from Madagascar, where it

is native, to the smaller island of Mauritius, to the east, it quickly became a

serious pest in cotton fields. In 1847 an English traveler, W. H. Benson, saw

the snails on Mauritius and took a few along with him to India. (Mauritius, it

happens, was home of the dodo, type specimen for extinct island animals

everywhere. The gargantuan snail can be seen as the Dodo's Revenge.) Benson's

snails multiplied prodigiously in India, as populations tend to do there. By

1900 the snail was in Ceylon, eating cocoa; next it was in Malaya, eating

rubber trees. From its new centers of dispersal it made slow, slimy, but steady

progress outward, eating melons, legumes, rice, rat poison--upon which it

thrived--and the lime from any whitewashed walls and fences that stood in its

way. It was introduced to the Micronesian islands by the Japanese, who

considered the snail a delicacy.<p>



<p>



In the Palau Islands once, as an experiment, I tried feeding the huge African

snails to the native estuarine crocodiles that were confined to cages on the

lawn of the small biology laboratory where I worked and lived. The trouble with

exotic arrivals on islands, I knew, is that few natural predators lie waiting

for them. Nothing could be more naturally predatory, I thought, than a

twelve-foot croc. The crocodiles rudely took the experimental snails from my

hand through the heavy mesh. Crocodiles can be very fast when they want to be,

and one small croc lacerated my finger against the cage before I realized its

head had moved. Each crocodile, having taken the shell, invariably fumbled and

dropped it. I think the crocodiles expected a whole arm, not just this

calcareous thing the hand was holding. The reptile would then retrieve the

snail, which clinked like a fifty-caliber shell casing against its teeth.

Suddenly deft, the crocodile tossed and shifted the snail backward down its

snaggly row of teeth toward the fulcrum at the corner of its jaw. It clamped

down, cracked the shell, swallowed. After two or three snails, unfortunately,

the dim reptilian brain came to realize it did not care for escargots, and each

crocodile lost interest.<p>



<p>



My crocodile results were typical. Those who have followed men like Mongoose

Forbes and "Snail" Benson--as that shortsighted Englishman might have been

called--and "Starling" Scheifflin and "Mynah" Hillebrand seldom have much luck

undoing the deeds of those notorious tinkerers. In their unnatural contexts

exotic pests seem to possess an unnatural vitality. Before coming to Hawaii I

had witnessed only one campaign--the program to control the coconut rhinoceros

beetle in Micronesia--in which man seemed to be winning.<p>



<p>



In Hawaii Volcanoes National Park the most destructive of exotic pests is the

pig. It is estimated that four thousand feral pigs live in the park, foraging

25 percent of its territory, or 60,000 acres. The damage they do is difficult

to quantify--pigs have been loose in Hawaii for centuries, and no pre-pig

baseline data exist--but in 1968 the Park Service gave quantification a try,

setting up an exclosure in the fern forest near Thurston Lava Tube. Pigs were

fenced out from the exclosure's 900 square meters of ohia trees and hapu'u and

Sadleria ferns. Thirteen years later, plots inside and outside the exclosure

were sampled and compared. Where pigs had roamed freely, Park Service

researchers found a more abundant cover of exotic grasses and herbs, a greater

number of exotic plant species, more exposed soil, and more exposed roots.

Inside the exclosure they found more native plant species, fewer exotics, less

exposed soil, and fewer exposed roots. The exclosure experiment confirmed the

intuitions of anyone who spends much time in the Hawaiian backcountry. The

enclosure had become a small, ferny, atavistic island drifting back toward the

flora of old Hawaii. Around it, sharky with pigs, was a sea drifting the other

way, toward pauperization, bastardization, and desert.<p>



<p>



It seemed to me now, standing in the 'Ola'a tree ferns with Dan Taylor, that

the most cosmopolitan of the alien animals I had seen on islands was the pig. I

remembered stumbling into the sandy bowls that feral pigs excavate in Galapagos

beaches as they snout out the nests of sea turtles. I recalled the small

deserts I had seen pigs make in the jungle around the stilted longhouses of

Iban tribesmen on Borneo, and the feral-pig damage I had observed in the

palmettos of the Sea Islands of Georgia. I decided that in the war against the

pigs I would throw in on Taylor's side.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



In the Jeep again, Taylor made a U-turn, and we retreated from our detour into

the Paleozoic of 'Ola'a. We left the tree ferns behind, passed out of Kilauea

Volcano's rainy zone, and drove southward into the lava desert of the Chain of

Craters Road. Zonation on islands is often radically abbreviated, and it was so

here--a ten-minute drive brought us into entirely different country. If the

'Ola'a ferns belonged to the Paleozoic, then this new terrain belonged to some

Archeozoic age of vulcanism or to some dry and blasted age of our future. We

passed through the small, black lithic sea of the 1969 lava flow, pushed up at

regular intervals into small buttes. The buttes were tree molds. Inside each

one were the remnants of an ohia that<p>



the lava had flowed over. We passed the pit craters for which the road is

named: Devil's Throat, Hi'iaka Crater, Puhimau Crater. The feral pig, versatile

animal, lives in this country, too.<p>



<p>



Taylor pulled the jeep off the road onto a cindery shoulder. On the eastern

side of the pavement was Puhimau Crater. On the western side was a thermal area

of whitened ohia snags and steamy ground--a pit crater in the process of

becoming, some vulcanologists believe. On the crater side was a pig fence.

Taylor, climbing down from the jeep, bent to tug at the lowermost wire.<p>



<p>



"The bottom wire is real tight--they can't root under it," he said. "If they do

start to root, we know it right away, because we walk the fence every two weeks

on inspections. We pull trees off the wire and fix breaks. Pigs are fast but

not particularly agile. They aren't good jumpers. The fence is only thirty-two

inches high, but that's enough."<p>



<p>



The fence ran to the edge of Puhimau Crater, incorporating that natural feature

as part of the pig barrier, and then resumed on the other side. The pigs within

this Puhimau Unit, fenced off from the rest of their kind, were under almost

daily attack by Park Service hunters and dogs.<p>



<p>



"Pigs were introduced two hundred years ago or more," Taylor said. "So a lot of

people here think of pigs as native animals. They don't understand why we are

trying to control them. The school system lets us down badly. The local schools

don't teach Hawaiian natural history. We have a huge education effort at hand.

We've got to manage the resource and educate people as to why. There's a lot of

misunderstanding on why we manage the park as we do. We're tolerated by most

people, understood by a few, disliked by some. Recreational pig hunters--the

Hawaiians who hunt for meat--are the most hostile."<p>



<p>



I considered for a moment the hypothesis that those hunters were right. Perhaps

the native ecosystem was so shattered that any attempt at reconstruction was

foolish. Better, maybe, to pretend that pigs and passionflowers were native, to

let them achieve some new balance, and start managing from there.<p>



<p>



"It's been two centuries now," I suggested. "Is there anything like a new

equilibrium?"<p>



<p>



Taylor shook his head. "The system has not begun to accommodate these

organisms." <p>



<p>



As we walked back to the jeep, Taylor nodded toward the roadside. "You see the

lighter-colored green in there?" I did. Among the drab, desert greens of scrub

ohia and pukiawe were clumps of a paler green. "Sandalwood," Taylor said.<p>



<p>



I knew something of the story of sandalwood: discovered by Captain Cook in

1778; commercialized by Captain Kendrick in 1791; worth eight to ten dollars a

picul in China, where the fragrant, close-grained heartwood was made into

incense, carvings, and cabinetwork; nearly extinct by 1886, when the logging

ceased. A picul, about 133 pounds, was the load that a Hawaiian was supposed to

be able to carry from the woods. King Kamehameha financed his conquest of the

Hawaiian Archipelago largely by the sale of sandalwood in Canton. I had written

all this up once, but I had never seen the actual tree.<p>



<p>



"Goats," Taylor explained. "There used to be a lot of them in here. Since we

eliminated the goats here, the sandalwoods are just bouncing back."<p>



<p>



The war against feral goats preceded the war against the pigs, and the rangers

learned many of the rules of animal warfare in that earlier effort. The goat,

Capra hircas, was probably introduced to Hawaii Island by Captain Cook in 1778,

in the vicinity of Kealekekua Bay, on the western shore, and it quickly spread

over the entire island. In the 1920s control efforts began in Hawaii Volcanoes

National Park. Between 1927 and 1970, 70,000 goats were killed in the park by

deputized hunters, rangers, foresters, Civilian Conservation Corps personnel

under ranger supervision, and "goat-control companies" of professional hunters.

In 1970 an aerial census showed about 15,000 goats left in the

park--approximately the same number estimated to have been there when the

goat-control efforts had begun, half a century before. The goat campaigns had

been ragtag, intermittent, almost recreational, much like unsuccessful goat

campaigns I had witnessed in the Galapagos. The campaigns in Hawaii had also

failed. The remarkable randiness and the high reproductive potential of Capra

hircus had overcome every one of them.<p>



<p>



After that 1970 census the Park Service declared war. Park planners devised a

long-range strategy: goatproof boundary fences, internal drift fences, frequent

drives, organized hunts, a vegetation-monitoring program to measure the success

or failure of their efforts. Between 1971 and 1975, 12,976 goats were killed.

Capra hircus became hard to find in the park. The citizen hunters participating

in the program lost interest and dropped out, but Park Service riflemen

continued, searching in helicopters--goat gunships--or on horseback, with dogs.

Between 1976 and 1979, 1,596 more goats were killed. By 1980 goats had been

fenced out of 90 percent of their former range and only about 200 remained in

the park.<p>



<p>



The surviving goats proved the hardest to eliminate, predictably, and the Park

Service experimented with new methods to get rid of them. The last and perhaps

cleverest was the old Judas-goat trick, updated. Radio collars were attached to

captured coats, which were then released.<p>



<p>



Goats are not fond of solitude, and each Judas goat invariably joined up with a

herd of its fellows. The rangers honed in on the beep of his signal. Today

fewer than half a dozen goats hold out in the park.<p>



<p>



Sitting in the jeep, Dan Taylor waved in the direction of Puhimau Crater. The

Park Service had begun experimenting with radio collars on pigs, too, he said.

Out there somewhere, in the Puhimau Unit, a sow was beeping. This was the first

reference I heard to the animal called the Electric Pig.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Bobby Mattos, one of the park's six full-time hunters, sat at a desk writing up

his report. Behind him a huge map of the park--a battle map, divided into

hunting units--covered the wall. Mattos had just returned from a day's hunt in

the Puhimau Unit. He was sweaty and dirty, and his T-shirt was torn. The hunter

is of Portuguese ancestry, lean, brown, and in his mid-twenties. His short

beard had once been trimmed along the jawline, but the shaved part had since

gone stubbly. He is handsome in a failed-bullfighter, Mexican-bandit sort of

way. He looked rough--he was a professional cutter of throats--but his smile on

greeting Taylor was shy. He told the boss that the dogs had bumped into the

Electric Pig that day. They had missed her, once again, but later had caught a

boar. He moved to the map, and his finger made a circle inside the Puhimau

border.<p>



<p>



"The dogs worked this area real good, but there were no hookups. So we went

down the Sow Trail. It's a trail they always use from the bottom up. They got a

main highway going up and down. Soon as we reached down, we started hitting

some t'ick undergrowth, and the dogs started to go crazy. This is where they

caught him. We couldn't see nothing. Had to go crawling underneat' to go get

him."<p>



<p>



(The Sow Trail is named for a predecessor of the Electric Pig. This sow, like

the Electric Pig, was one of six feral pigs trapped, fitted with radio collars,

and released in the Puhimau Unit. The sow of Sow Trail was considerably less

ingenious than the Electric Pig. Her invariable habit when flushed by the dogs

was to run a beeline down what became known as the Sow Trail. The radio man

followed her flight with his antenna. He reported that she would hide that

night and most of the next day at the dry end of the unit, and then the next

evening would work her way back to the wet end, where the foraging was good.

This beeline sow was no more. Of the six radio-collared pigs released in

Puhimau, only one, the Electric Pig, survived.)<p>



<p>



"This one today, he put up a good fight," Mattos said, of this afternoon's

boar. "He probably said, 'Hey? you ain't gonna take me.' He picked a good place

to fight 'em, too--thick stuff, dogs cannot move around. He gave Keoki some

pokes, too. I got a note down at the kennel. Keoki got one underneath the jaw,

and a couple of skins."<p>



<p>



Bobby Mattos is a speaker of pidgin. When his ancestors arrived from Madeira

and the Azores to work in the cane, they met immigrant workers from the

Philippines, China, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Japan, and pidgin evolved among

them as a lingua franca, a lingua sacchara. Like most pidgin-speakers, Mattos

can turn the dialect up or down. In the field, hunting pigs, he turns it up

thick and strong. In the office he turns it down almost to English, and Taylor

can understand him.<p>



<p>



The pigs know what's going on, for sure," Mattos said, of the embattled few in

the Puhimau Unit. "They're so afraid, you know? They're running for their

lives. This pig today, the tracker barked him. Just one bark, and the pig was

gone. I oooshed Paele on him, 'Go, go, go, go!'  He knew which direction that

buggah had run, and he found 'im again. We had Mo'o, too. Mo'o is a grabber,

too. But that pig was so aggressive, he couldn't get in. Only Keoki got in.<p>



<p>



Taylor turned to me. "Out of fifteen dogs, we have three grabbers," he

explained. "The grabbers are like infantrymen. They're the ones that get

hurt."<p>



<p>



The tracker finds the pig, the grabbers grab it, and the helpers help, worrying

its heels. The dogs' job is to surround and hold the pig, cutting off its

escape routes until the hunters come up. The dogs sometimes kill small pigs on

their own, and they routinely dispatch piglets, which the park's hunters call

"rabbits." This pig-hunting method--one or two men and a pack of

dogs--developed in the Paleolithic and is still the method Hawaii's sport

hunters use. Park Service strategists have given some thought to new wrinkles.

What would happen, they wonder, if they used a single dog trained to bark at

the pig and not attack; suppose it was some small, unthreatening, yappy breed

at which the pig would laugh before resuming his rooting? The dog would flag

the pig by sound for the rifleman coming up behind. For now, however, the park

men are sticking with the Paleolithic method. Park Service dogs are sometimes

wounded, but the pack has yet to suffer a fatality. Pigs run through human

beings who stand in their way. The humans go down like bowling pins, but the

pigs are generally in too much of a hurry to work them over on the ground. Men

hunting for pork are sometimes injured in Hawaii, but none of the Park Service

hunters has been hurt.<p>



<p>



"Keoki, he's kind of an old dog, isn't he?" Taylor asked Mattos.<p>



<p>



"Yeah. He's just a bull, too--pit bull."<p>



<p>



"Pit bulls aren't good for this?" I asked.<p>



<p>



"They're good," said Mattos, "but not too much brain, you know?"<p>



<p>



The hunter looked to the map on the wall. "Before this program, wherever you go

there's pig damage, no matter where you look," he said. "Now all you see is

green grass growing. Today the only damage I seen was real hard to see. It was

underneath the uluhe ferns. They're not coming out anymore. They can stay ALIVE

underneath the uluhe, but they're not gonna come out and knock down hapu'u, or

nothin' like that."<p>



<p>



The thick tangles of uluhe, the false staghorn fern, reminded Bobby Mattos of

the Electric Pig. "That sow, she sure knows what's going on," he said. "She

just knows where to run. Dogs cannot pick up real good speed in the uluhe. They

get all tangled up, whereas the pig will just put down her nose and--no

problem. She's like a torpedo through there."<p>



<p>



Pigs, built close to the ground, are made for crashing through brush, Dan

Taylor explained. Dogs are rangier animals, and less canny. He asked if I had

noticed the cracks on Kilauea. I had. Cracks ramify everywhere on the slopes of

that volcano, a consequence of seismic shifts accompanying the mountain's

vulcanism. Those cracks were often hidden by uluhe and other vegetation, Taylor

said, and dogs sometimes fell into them. Pigs did not. Bobby Mattos nodded, and

confessed that just last week the hunters had lost a dog in a crack. Dogs fell

thirty feet sometimes, and the hunters had to go down after them with ropes and

harnesses. It was slimy down there, Mattos added, making a face. "A pig knows

the cracks, but the dogs don't know."<p>



<p>



I could see how it was: The Electric Pig fleeing like a torpedo down her

runways under the uluhe--captured once and collared, determined never to be

captured again--the men cursing behind her, the dogs crashing through the fern

tangles. Then the yelp as a tracker or a grabber felt the earth open up

beneath, his barking suddenly frantic and distant, like the complaint of a fly

trapped under a tumbler, the Electric Pig running on.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



We left the watershed of Kilauea volcano, the five dogs tied to the bed of the

truck by short leashes. Ahead the smooth arc of Mauna Loa showed a pale red in

the dawn light. Later in the morning a cap of cloud would form cutting off the

summit. Only early risers get to see the whole of the earth's greatest active

volcano.<p>



<p>



I could remember no mountain in my life that gave so poor a sense of scale. At

this hour it looked more a mountain of sand than of lava. Mauna Loa might have

been a near, lunate dune encroaching on the backside of this ohia forest. It

might have been a giant, pale-rose moon rising over the same ohias.<p>



<p>



The truth was somewhere in between. Mauna Loa contains 10,000 cubic miles of

material. I once heard a park interpreter tell a Volcanoes Park audience that

this one mountain contains more rock than the entire Sierra Nevada and Mount

Shasta combined. Her facts were wrong but nicely suggestive. Mauna Loa is among

the largest shield volcanoes in the solar system. Theia Mons, on Venus, is

considerably larger, and Olympus Mons, on Mars, is even larger than Theia, but

both those places are far away, and you can't get there by pickup truck.<p>



<p>



Turning off the highway onto the Mauna Loa Strip Road, we left the ohias behind

and meandered up through koa forest. The turns were sharp, the surface cracked

and potholed. The koa trunks, white in the early-morning light, reminded me of

aspen back home. The truck flushed several coveys of California quail. They

were exotics, but I was glad to see them. It was hard to feel indignant--I am

an exotic from California myself.<p>



<p>



This trip into the dry forest of Mauna Loa's lower slopes was a training hunt

for the young dogs and for me. The pigs of the Puhimau Unit, where the hunters

had been concentrating their efforts lately, were so close to eradication--just

three to six pigs left--that sometimes days passed without the dogs' flushing a

single one. Today the plan was to reacquaint the dogs and acquaint the

writer.<p>



<p>



Harry Pagan drove, checking the dogs occasionally in his rearview mirror. Pagan

is Filipino-Puerto Rican, a dark-skinned man, stocky and quiet. At thirty-two,

he is the oldest of the hunters.<p>



<p>



"He seems to me the best of the lot," one of his Park Service superiors had

told me. "He goes THROUGH the uluhe. He doesn't plan his hunt, or try to hunt

around anything. He just goes where he thinks the pigs are going to be. He's a

joy to hunt with. He's really good with a needle--good at sewing dogs up,

getting them back to health once they get gored by pigs. Harry is unusual in

that he hunts the 'Ola'a Tract. Most hunters in the 'Ola'a rain forest will

look for signs right by the road. Harry will hike back for a couple of hours or

more."<p>



<p>



I had spoken with one female ranger who was convinced, having watched Pagan's

calm intensity in the hunt, having seen his efficiency at killing pigs in

hand-to-hoof combat, with a knife, that Pagan was a Vietnam combat veteran--had

to be. He is not, but he does do weekend duty with the National Guard. He likes

the military, and in conversation he often turns to soldiering for his

metaphors. His partner today was Casey Baldwin, a young, blond Californian

working seasonally as a hunter.<p>



<p>



The dogs were Paele, Gus, Hana, Shy, and Moku. Paele was the tracker, the

oldest and most experienced of the five. His name means "black" in Hawaiian,

and he certainly was that. Gus looked to be part airedale, and Hana looked

vaguely like a collie. Shy was a short-haired, muscular mongrel with a snuffly,

rasping way of breathing that came, Pagan said, from heartworm. Moku was a

lean, rawboned, ribby one-year-old that looked to be part black-and-tan. The

park's kennel-keeper and dog-procurer had told me, earlier that morning, of the

importance of finding dogs with the right "lines." I could not remember meeting

a bunch of dogs with lines more sketchy and tangled. I suspected that these had

been recruited from hangouts comparable to the ones where, in human society,

the French recruit legionnaires.<p>



<p>



Halfway to the end of the road Pagan pulled off and parked. We unbuckled the

collars, and the freed dogs hit the roadside bushes, marking every shrub in

sight. That accomplished, we entered the bush. One after another the dogs

stopped, hunkered in the shamefaced way of dogs, and unloaded, lightening

themselves for the job. For a time that odor was heavy upon us. Then all the

dogs were in running trim, and we smelled nothing other than the good desert

pungency of the xeric vegetation on Mauna Loa's middle flanks. We wore long

sleeves against the thorns, and baseball caps against the sun. We carried our

lunch and water in day packs, and Casey Baldwin cradled the rifle, a lever

action .30-.30.<p>



<p>



A knife was best for pigs, Pagan told me as we walked. A knife was economical

and less risky for the dogs. Sticking a pig wasn't as hard as it sounded--once

you had a pig by the back legs, he was yours. In certain situations, though,

you had to shoot. A .22 was too small for the job. I wondered aloud about other

calibers. What about a 30.06? Both hunters laughed at me. Too big, they said:

it would go right through the pig and hit the dogs.<p>



<p>



"Oh, I hunt from ten years old," Pagan said, when I asked. "On my own, and with

my uncle. At ten years old, I knew how to stick a pig--the whole works. My

first experience, I was scared. We caught four pigs in one bunch. They make a

big sound, let me tell you. Loud grunting. MEAN! In those days there's so much

pigs, man. I mean it was unreal. Now you really have to work for your pigs."<p>



<p>



"And you still like it?"<p>



<p>



He smiled and waggled his head weakly, ruefully--a man admitting to a powerful

addiction. "Oh, I love it."<p>



<p>



We were moving through open parkland broken here and there by pukiawe thickets.

Now and again Pagan would stop and intently watch Paele, the tracker. It was as

if he were reading in Paele's behavior some transliteration of the olfactory

messages the dog was picking up. We came to places where pigs had rooted. They

had left furrows in the grass, the clods overturned, the undersides

fine-bearded with rootlets. It was old sign, and Pagan was not interested. The

dogs coursed through the bush without barking, and the two hunters spoke very

little.<p>



<p>



"You don't give voice commands," I observed.<p>



<p>



"We're not too much into obedience," Pagan answered. "The only thing is to get

them to fight the pig, right now. It's in the dog. If he's going to be a

hunter, he'll show signs of interest early. Some are just natural. Some take

longer than others. You got some cowards. You got some that just grab."<p>



<p>



"They get hurt that way? Just grabbing?"<p>



<p>



Pagan smiled and shook his head in sympathy for those dogs--yes, they got hurt

that way. "Sows usually do the biting. I've seen dogs get their leg broken,

just one bite. The boars use the tusk more. A tusk is what hurt Keoki the other

day."<p>



<p>



When we came to pukiawe thickets, Pagan generally would lead us through the

middles. I understood why--if hunters were afraid to bushwhack, if the centers

of pukiawe thickets remained inviolate, then pigs would never be eradicated

from the national park--but fighting pukiawe was hard work. The sun climbs

quickly in the subtropics, and soon we were all sweating or lolling our

tongues. As the heat rose, so did the odor of the dogs. This pack did not smell

at all like domestic dogs. They smelled gamy and half-wild, like the feral

animals they were hunting.<p>



<p>



Moku, the rawboned one-year-old, was a frolicker in tall grass. Whenever we

came to a vale of it, he set off bounding, sometimes causing a chain reaction

among the others, who thought he was onto something. Harry Pagan would watch

Moku's false alarms expressionlessly and then smile a small, skeptical smile.

Moku, it seemed to me, had little future as a hunter. <p>



<p>



Hana did not seem promising material either, and in this view Casey Baldwin

concurred. "Hana's just a carpet," Baldwin complained. Hana malingered, as

usual, hanging back with us human beings. "That dog was meant to be in the

bathroom, to wipe your feet on." Harry Pagan, always the defender of young

dogs, was more charitable. "He's still learning. Some take a while."<p>



<p>



Paele, the tracker, was all business. Shy, the dog with heartworm, was diligent

enough, but after an hour or two in the sun his malady began to slow him. "He's

good for just so long," Pagan said.<p>



<p>



Our luck with pigs was poor, and Pagan apologized. The trouble was lunar, he

said.<p>



<p>



"When we got a big moon, the pigs they travel, they travel. They move all night

and sleep during the day. Without no moon, the pigs they sleep at night. When

the big moon, you see a whole lot of sign, and you keep following, following."

The pigs were skinny up here in the dry forest of Mauna Loa, he said. Pigs

liked it better in the 'Ola'a rain forest. They liked the cool, and the mud,

and the hapu'u, and 'Ola'a pigs tasted better. Pagan usually smoked his pig, or

made it into sausage. He promised to take me to the 'Ola'a rain forest and show

me some real pig hunting.<p>



<p>



"You should have been here in July, when we were hunting in Napau," Pagan said.

"If you were here in July, you'd need lots of notebooks. Forty-six pigs in

twenty-one days. Camping out, drinking warm beer. No ice."<p>



<p>



The Napau Unit, it happened, was where Kilauea was currently erupting. Recently

the volcano had been going off every thirteen days or so, sending up

incandescent thousand-foot fountains of lava, building a new cone at the place

designated "O-vent," turning the night sky red. Today, as we rested in Mauna

Loa's 'shade, O-vent was due for its twenty-fifth eruption in the series. Two

eruptions ago, in that time of phenomenal hunting luck and warm beer, the

hunters had been out after pigs when the volcano began to rumble. They heard

the roar, like a jet engine in an interminable takeoff. They looked up to see

cinders everywhere coming down from the sky. The hunting was too good to break

off. They killed eight more pigs before discretion won out and they retreated

from the volcano.<p>



<p>



Our rest over, we plunged into another thicket of pukiawe. When we came out on

the other side, Harry saw a farther pukiawe thicket, and we plunged into

that.<p>



<p>



Pukiawe, in the days of Hawaiian royalty, was the great equalizer. If a chief

wished to lift his own kapu, temporarily suspending his untouchability in order

to rub shoulders with commoners, he shut himself up in a smokehouse and cured

himself over a smudge fire of pukiawe. Bushwhacking through the pukiawe now,

sweaty and itchy, our pant legs burnished by the hides of sun-heated half-wild

mongrels and slavered on by tongues, our shirts sappy and dirty and prickly

with burrs, we had the common touch already. The pukiawe wasn't necessary.<p>



<p>



By eleven in the morning the dogs had begun to drag. Several times Baldwin,

coming up behind Paele, would shift his rifle, grab Paele by the scruff, and

pitch the tracker forward. No disrespect was intended. Paele seemed grateful

for these jet-assisted boosts onward into the fray.<p>



<p>



We came to a sand of koas, and the dogs detoured inside to pant in the shade.

At the edge of the grove were the remains of a pig killed on a previous hunt. A

black, tusked head lay in the center of a dark and greasy circle on the grass.

The smell was very high. I found the dead pig disquieting, like the pig that

gave the tide to Lord of the Flies. One of the dogs sniffed and prepared to

roll in it. Pagan barked a guttural warning, and the dog drew back instantly.

It pretended it had never really been interested in rolling, and trotted on

into the shade.<p>



<p>



When we reached the road again and the hunt was done, we had encountered no

pigs. Pagan and I waited in the shade with the dogs while Baldwin walked down

the road to fetch the truck. Moku sat between Pagan's legs and licked his face.

The hunter accepted this for a while and then began to wrestle with Moku's

jaws, holding them open while the dog squirmed. When Pagan released the jaws,

Moku came back for more.<p>



<p>



Pagan told me of a precocious puppy owned by a friend of his on the Kona coast,

a puppy just ten months old and already covered with battle scars. A dog that

aggressive was unusual. He spoke of Jim, one of the better trackers in the Park

Service pack. As soon as Jim found a pig, he lost interest. He was a detective,

not a warrior. While the other dogs cornered and fought the pig, Jim was off

looking for another. "That was my dog," Pagan said. "I give him to the park.

Too much noise, nighttime. Just want to go hunt." Harry spoke of hounds. Baying

dogs were no good for this sort of work, he said. "You bring hounds here, no

telling where the pig would stop. As long as he hears the hounds behind him,

he's gonna keep running." Some sort of cross-hound was an interesting idea,

Pagan thought. He spoke of the Electric Pig.<p>



<p>



"That pig is so smart, you know? She has experience with people. On a transect

one time, we saw her with three babies. On different hunts we managed to get

all her babies. I think right now she doesn't have anything to look forward to.

She doesn't have to worry about her babies. She can move out, she knows the

terrain, she can hear the dogs. She won't stick around."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



In the war against the pigs, as in most wars, the generals speak a different

language from that of the troops. "We achieved about fifty percent removal in

mesic forest--medium-wetness forest, like on Mauna Loa Strip Road--in six

months, which is better than you need to extinct the population in a three-year

period, if our models and densities are about right," C. P. Stone told me.<p>



<p>



Chuck Stone is the officer in charge of research for the pig-control program.

Sitting at his desk, shelves of reports and bulletins and monographs behind

him, he recited, off the top of his head, the figures on the enemy: The average

age of the pigs caught was sixteen months, the average weight sixty-eight

pounds. The oldest pig taken so far had been seven, and at that age its teeth

were almost gone.<p>



<p>



Most of the pigs taken in Volcanoes Park were of the dark phenotype, but

occasionally the hunters, or a trap, turned up a pig with Polynesian

characteristics--the straight ears, the long snout, the woolly undercoat.<p>



<p>



Stone had just returned from an emergency meeting in Kipahulu Valley, on the

island of Maui, where feral pigs were on an offensive into new territory. The

Maui pigs were closer to domestic stock, with more red and brindled

black-and-white in them. In Volcanoes Park pigs, Stone said, the parasite load

varied with the habitat. The pigs up in the music forest of Mauna Loa were

generally quite clean. The pigs in the drier, more stressful Puhimau Unit were

often loaded. Pigs could accommodate a lot of internal company, and some

Puhimau pigs, when you opened them up, just crawled.<p>



<p>



Stone told me that the first method tried against the pigs of Volcanoes Park

had been box traps, which were all the rage against feral pigs in Australia and

California. "We had really good luck with that," he said. "We took quite a few

pigs fast, and we thought, 'Boy, we're really home free.' It only lasted a

couple of weeks, and then the numbers of pigs caught started going down. We now

think we were just creaming off some of the younger and more naive animals."<p>



<p>



Since then, he said, the pig-fighters have tried snaring, with some success.

They once tried netting, with no success at all. Stone has given some thought

to poison but doubts that that measure would prove economical. A few radical

pig-detesters on Hawaii Island have contemplated introducing hog cholera and

pseudorabies, but Stone has never favored such extreme measures. By far the

best method to date, he said, has been hunters and dogs.<p>



<p>



"The average success has been a pig every day's hunt. Lately we haven't been

doing that well in areas where we have fewer pigs. With these last pigs we're

going to have to get more inventive, as we did with goats."<p>



<p>



My thoughts of late had turned Darwinian. I remembered the Electric Pig. "Has

it ever crossed your mind that you might be producing a superpig out there?" I

asked.<p>



<p>



"Sure. That's what they've done with pheasants on the mainland, to a certain

degree. All the pheasants that haven't flown before the gun are selected for,

and you've got a lot more running pheasants. The same thing with some of the

quail. And it's happened here, too, with our goat program. A lot of the

surviving goats in this park are the black ones, the ones that dive down into

the cracks as soon as they hear the helicopter. We're going to get something

like that with pigs."<p>



<p>



"But the difference with pigs," I suggested, "is that the thing you're molding

is intelligence. A pig is an unusually intelligent animal, no?"<p>



<p>



"Sure. Psychological tests put them well ahead of dogs. "<p>



<p>



"You might be producing a pig that's able to handle any contingency?"<p>



<p>



"Perhaps. What we're hoping, of course, is that by fencing areas, and doing a

wipe-out in each area, we're preventing the pigs from passing those genes

on."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



 At 4:30 in the morning, a fragrant pre-dawn, the hunters assembled, joking

sleepily and complaining, outside the pig-control office. Harry Pagan handed

out headlamps and tested his walkie-talkie. We were headed for the Puhimau Unit

in pursuit of the Electric Pig.<p>



<p>



"You got rounds for the carbine?" Bobby Mattos asked.<p>



<p>



"We got two clips over there, " Pagan answered. "What a beautiful morning--to

be in bed."<p>



<p>



Pagan drove the Scout down to the kennel, and Bobby Mattos drove the pickup.

The dogs were eager, whining and jumping up against the cages, the mesh

thrashing in the darkness. Pagan, buckling Shy to his collar on the Scout,

turned his face away as Shy tried to lick. He finished buckling by feel. I

stood alongside Pat Finnegan, one of the hunters, and together we leashed dogs

to the side panel of the truck. Finnegan was thinking about our quarry. "They

think it's more important to get her out than the others," he said. "I don't

know why. I'm tired of chasing her, really."<p>



<p>



Pagan, Casey Baldwin, six dogs, and I began the hunt by walking the Puhimau

Unit's southern fence. Bobby Mattos, Pat Finnegan, and their six dogs entered

Puhimau from the other side and bushwhacked cross-country toward us. Andy

Kikuta, the radio man, stationed himself on a dirt road that bordered the unit

at right angles to our fenceline, and with a hand-held antenna he monitored the

Electric Pig.<p>



<p>



The dawn came on quickly, and we never really needed the headlamps. The steeply

ascendant, sparsely foliated branches of the ohia were lovely against the

lightening sky. Ohia branches beseech heaven in a way that has always made me

think of Judith Anderson in Sandra, and the old Hawaiians saw it more or less

the same way--as a woman dancing the hula.<p>



<p>



The light came up, color entered the world, and we could make out the scarlet

of the ohia blossoms. The blossoms made the only points of warm color in a

landscape from the cool end of the spectrum, hot spots in a xerophytic

vegetation of drab olives and greens. In the old days the flowers of the ohia

were sacred to Pele, the goddess of volcanoes. The reason, I would bet, is that

each circle of long, scarlet stamens looks so much like lava fountaining. Each

blossom is a little eruption.<p>



<p>



Uluhe ferns grew everywhere, and the dogs floundered through. Sometimes the

springy mats of ferns, like trampolines, refused to let the dogs down to earth;

other times the mats let the dogs down hard.<p>



<p>



"See the noise they make?" Pagan asked. He shook his head. "Pigs have tunnels

underneath. Once a pig gets running in those tunnels, dogs can't stop him."<p>



<p>



Mo'o, a pit bull with extraordinary vertical leap, was hunting in Pagan's pack

today. This morning Mo'o was given to jumping the fence and hunting on the

wrong side. Once, on impulse, from a dead standstill he cleared the

thirty-two-inch fence with ease. Pagan looked back at me to see if I'd seen.

"Mo'o is one of our acrobats," he said.<p>



<p>



Mo'o is a grabber who has a long acquaintance with Pagan's sewing needle. He

sometimes appears all slashed and bleeding from private wars of his own.

Finding a pig by himself, he leaps in without bothering to bark for assistance.

In Hawaiian, mo'o means "lizard, dragon," or "water spirit," or "young, as of

pigs and dogs," or "brindled." Brindled dogs were favored as sacrifices to the

water spirits. This was before pit bulls, of course, back in the days when

Hawaii's dogs were vegetarian. It would have been impolitic to sacrifice a dog

with the temperament of this particular Mo'o. Mo'o was brindled, all right, but

sent on to the next world he would cheerfully have gone for the water spirits'

throats.<p>



<p>



At intervals Pagan would stop to confer by walkie-talkie with Andy Kikuta. He

would inform Kikuta of our approximate position along the fence, and Kikuta

would in turn give the Electric Pig's coordinates in relation to us. We were

closing in on her, Pagan's dogs from one side, Bobby Mattos's dogs from the

other.<p>



<p>



Once, while speaking on the walkie-talkie, Pagan crouched and with an epee of

swordgrass flicked leaf fragments from the twin clefts of a hoofprint. Until he

cleaned it up, the print had been invisible to me. Another time, while

listening to Kikuta give the new coordinates for the Electric Pig, Pagan

pointed wordlessly to a spot low on the trunk of a small ohia, a place where

the wood was debarked and worn smooth. A pig had rubbed itself there, Pagan

whispered. Inside the smooth zone I saw the deep scratch of a tusk.<p>



<p>



Pagan signed off and returned the walkie-talkie to his belt. We had the

Electric Pig where we wanted her, he announced. We were driving her straight

toward Bobby Mattos and his dogs.<p>



<p>



Passing a seedling shrub, Pagan uprooted it. "'Akia," he said. "They used this

to make rope." Handing me one end, he invited me to pull and see how strong it

was. It was strong indeed. I had read that the root and bark of 'akia were

poisonous, the hemlock of old Hawaii. "This is to keep you alive," the Hawaiian

who presented the bowl was supposed to have recited, ironically. Rough humor,

but welcome, perhaps, like that salutation Socrates himself offered before

downing his last drink.<p>



<p>



I thought of the Electric Pig. She was in at least as tough a spot as

Socrates'. I found myself wondering what would happen to a pig who took

Hawaiian hemlock. Nothing, probably, considering the gastric prowess of pigs.<p>



<p>



We were nearly to the dirt road. Kikuta and his radio antenna were just fifty

yards away, through thick ohia, and Bobby Mattos was closing in to our left. We

heard Mattos's dogs jump the Electric Pig. Our own dogs vanished in that

direction. We ran toward the sound ourselves, but after seventy yards or so the

barking and crashing of brush was coming from too many quarters, and we stopped

and waited. The walkie-talkie crackled, and Mattos came on to inform us that

his dogs had failed to stop the pig.<p>



<p>



We sat in the shade of the ohia trees, temporarily defeated, waiting for the

dogs to reassemble. After a time the brush parted and Kikuta emerged, carrying

his antenna by the pistol grip. He gestured with the antenna toward the forest

behind us. The pig had circled around that way, he said. He and Pagan exchanged

fatalistic looks.<p>



<p>



"That pig sending us to the cleaner, boy," Pagan said.<p>



<p>



"And not so big, either," Kikuta said. "Sixty pounds."<p>



<p>



"That size can run. She's got her plan all down already. 'If they hit me from

the front, break this way one hundred yards, then cut left.'"<p>



<p>



We heard a rushing from the brush. "One dog coming?" Pagan asked.<p>



<p>



"Yes," Kikuta answered.<p>



<p>



Pagan listened hard. "Mo'o," he predicted, from the sound of the dog's

breathing. Half a minute later Mo'o emerged from the brush.<p>



<p>



Five minutes after Mo'o, Bobby Mattos emerged, sweat shining on his forehead,

and right behind him was Pat Finnegan. Pagan took a look at Mattos's face.<p>



<p>



"Bobby, Bobby, Bobby. No get mad. No get mad."<p>



<p>



Mattos cursed the pig.<p>



<p>



In the quest for the Electric Pig, Harry Pagan plays Starbuck to Bobby Mattos's

Ahab.<p>



<p>



Pat Finnegan joined the rest of us where we sat in the shade, but Mattos would

not sit. "Ten meters, the bark, from me to you," Mattos told Pagan. The

Electric Pig had been that close.<p>



<p>



"I felt stupid," Finnegan said. "I was running toward the first bark when I

heard the second bark way down there."<p>



<p>



"Skid marks," said Mattos. He imitated, perfectly, the sound of a car squealing

through a skid and then accelerating at the far end. "It looks like one place

they try to grab her. Skid marks--bust-up, spin-around kind. What is this, my

fifth time I hit her?"<p>



<p>



The dogs Shy and Gus showed up, their tongues hanging, and they plopped in the

shade. They had been hunting with Mattos's group today. "Can you tell us where

the Electric Pig is?" Casey Baldwin asked. Neither dog seemed to have any

idea.<p>



<p>



The other dogs straggled in. Hana was among the first, and he immediately set

to digging a hole for himself in the shade. Hana puts vastly more energy into

making himself comfortable during rest stops than he puts into pig-hunting in

the intervals between.<p>



<p>



"As long as we take Hana, we always have fresh sign," Pagan said. "And hana in

Hawaiian means 'work.'" He laughed at the irony. Baldwin, reaching out, made

pig tracks with his knuckles in Hana's fresh black dirt. His tracks were good

imitations. They would have fooled me, at least.<p>



<p>



When the last of the dogs was accounted for, we returned to the hunt, working

back in the direction we had come. Discarding any semblance of fair play, we

began tracking the pig directly by radio. Andy Kikuta accompanied us, holding

the antenna aloft to take a reading from time to time. The original purpose of

the radio-collar--to study the behavior of pigs when flushed by dogs--had been

forgotten. Casey Baldwin, whom I was following, grumbled a little. This was

unsporting, he said. It made no sense to chase one pig this way, when five or

six others still held out in the Puhimau Unit.<p>



<p>



We were drawing close to the Electric Pig, and I had a strong intuition that

this time we would get her. My feelings were mixed; I had developed

considerable admiration for this pig. Suddenly her radio signal ceased.<p>



<p>



Kikuta cast about for it without success. This had never happened before, and

Kikuta looked puzzled. "It must be the terrain," he said. "She must be down in

a puka somewhere."<p>



<p>



Climbing a small ohia and getting no signal, he tried a taller tree. I lay on

my back, folding my hands behind my head, and watched him climb. Kikuta looked

good up there, his legs scissoring a crotch twenty feet high, with bright

clouds moving above him. He pointed the antenna in one direction, then another.

We listened for the beep. No sound came but the breeze in the crowns of the

ohias. Perhaps the Electric Pig was still down in a puka--down in a hole.

Perhaps this Einstein of pigs had figured a way to avoid human radar

entirely.<p>



<p>



Harry Pagan, taking a plastic quart bottle from his pack, raised it high and

poured a thin stream for the dogs. Instantly they convened under it. Today's

hunt was over, I realized. This tipping of the bottle was a gesture of

concession to the Electric Pig. She would live to root again, at least until

tomorrow.<p>



<p>



The dogs always behave for Pagan, and not one growled or shoved in the slender

waterfall from the bottle. They made a pyramid of dusty hides and lapping

tongues, and I thought, oddly, of that statue of the Marines raising the flag

on Iwo Jima. This was dog sculpture. Pagan cocked his head to study the lines.

For an instant the stream would spatter off a dog's forehead, and then that dog

would reposition itself. Nothing was wasted; tongues intercepted it all.<p>



<p>



"And not a drop hits the ground," I said to Pagan.<p>



<p>



He smiled in what I took to be agreement, though I was not certain he was

really listening. He emptied the first bottle and started a second, smiling his

secret smile of pure love for dogs. Toward the end he remembered to save a

swallow for himself.

	<font size=5>W</font>illiam James corresponded with many people of many sorts. Sometimes he
communicated by postcards, or short notes; at others he wrote copious letters.
Whether he was compressing his correspondence into the briefest messages, or
allowing it to expand into letters of friendly badinage and extended comment,
he was incapable of writing a half page that was not characteristic, free, and
vivid. But in the short space available here it will be impossible to do more
than give a few letters, and accordingly a small number which illustrate
different traits of his character and correspondence have been selected.<p>

<p>

A brief preliminary reminder of certain biographical facts will help the reader
to follow them.<p>

<p>

<p>

William James was born in 1842, had an irregular education in New York,
Newport, and Europe, and entered the Lawrence Scientific School in Cambridge in
1861. His tastes and inclinations defined themselves but slowly, and during the
ten years that followed he was frequently compelled to interrupt or abandon his
work on account of illness. He studied chemistry for a while, and then
comparative anatomy under Jeffries Wyman; entered the Harvard Medical School;
broke off to go to Brazil with Louis Agassiz's expedition; went to Germany for
a year and a half in pursuit of physiology and health without making much
progress in either pursuit; returned to Cambridge and, after taking his medical
degree at Harvard, spent three years under his father's roof without any
definite occupation. He passed through distressing periods of mental depression
during these years of frustration. This first phase of his manhood may be
considered to have lasted until his appointment to teach physiology at Harvard
in 1872.<p>

<p>

During the next seven years he had regular and stimulating responsibilities.
His health improved, his powers of work developed; he 'found himself.' He
turned definitely to psychology as his immediate chief interest, and started
the first psychological laboratory in America.<p>

<p>

His life, during the thirteen years between 1878 and 1891, was laborious and
productive. It was during these years that he prepared the chapters of the
Principles of Psychology and published them in Mind and other journals. Toward
the end of the 'eighties (which is also the end of the time covered by the
letters selected for this number of the Atlantic) he had not only attained to a
position of influence in the Harvard world, but was known on both sides of the
Atlantic as a brilliant and original contributor to psychological science.<p>

<p>

The student days and the following period of uncertainty and enforced idleness
in which there was more time for sociability than there ever was later, may
first be illustrated by four letters.]<p>

                                           CAMBRIDGE [circa September, 1863.]<p>

<p>

MY DEAREST MOTHER,--<p>

To answer the weighty questions which you propound: I am glad to leave Newport
because I am tired of the place itself, and because of the reason which you
have very well expressed in your letter, the necessity of the whole family
being near the arena of the future activity of us young men. I recommend
Cambridge on account of its own pleasantness (though I don't wish to be
invidious towards Brookline, Longwood, and other places), and because of its
economy if I or Harry continue to study here much longer....I feel very much
the importance of making soon a final choice of my business in life. I stand
now at the place where the road forks. One branch leads to material comfort,
the flesh-pots, but it seems a kind of selling of one's soul. The other to
mental dignity and independence, combined, however, with physical penury.<p>

<p>

If I myself were the only one concerned, I should not hesitate an instant in my
choice. But it seems hard on Mrs. W. J., 'that not impossible she,' to ask her
to share an empty purse and a cold hearth. On one side is SCIENCE, upon the
other BUSINESS (the honorable, honored and productive business of printing
seems most attractive), with medicine, which partakes of [the] advantages of
both between them, but which has drawbacks of its own.<p>

<p>

I confess I hesitate. I fancy there is a fond maternal cowardice which would
make you and every other mother contemplate with complacency the worldly
fatness of a son, even if obtained by some sacrifice of his 'higher nature.'
But I fear there might be some anguish at looking back from the pinnacle of
prosperity (NECESSARILY reached, if not by eating dirt, at least by renouncing
some divine ambrosia) over the life you might have led in the pure pursuit of
truth. It seems as if one COULD not afford to give that up for any bribe,
however great. Still, I am undecided. The medical term opens to-morrow, and
between this and the end of the term here, I shall have an opportunity of
seeing a little into medical business. I shall confer with Wyman about the
prospects of a naturalist and finally decide.<p>

<p>

I want you to become familiar with the notion that I MAY stick to science,
however, and drain away at your property for a few years more. If I can get
into Agassiz's museum I think it not improbable I may receive a salary of $400
to $500 in a couple of years. I know some stupider than I who have done so. You
see in that case how desirable it would be to have a home in Cambridge. Anyhow
I am convinced that SOMEWHERE in this neighborhood is the place for us to rest.
These matters have been a good deal on my mind lately, and I am very glad to
get this chance of pouring them into yours. As for the other boys, I don't
know. And that idle and useless young female, Alice, too, whom we shall have to
feed and clothe! Cambridge is all right for business in Boston. Living in
Boston or Brookline, etc., would be as expensive as Newport, if Harry or I
stayed here, for we could not easily go home every day.<p>

<p>

Give my warmest love to Aunt Kate, Father, who I hope will not tumble again,
and all of them over the way. Recess in three weeks, till then, my dearest and
best of old mothers, good-bye. <p>

                     Your loving son,<p>

                                                            W. J.<p>

Give my best love to Kitty and give cette petite humbug of a Minny* a hint
about writing to me. I hope you liked your shawl.<p>

Cherie de Jeune Balle,--<p>

I am just in from town in the keen, cold and eke beauteous moonlight, which by
the above qualities makes me think of thee, to whom, nor to whose aunt, have I
(not) yet written. (I don't understand the grammar of the not.) Your first
question is, 'where have I been?' To C. S. Peirce's lecture, which I could not
understand a word of but rather enjoyed the sensation of listening to for an
hour. I then turned to O. W. Holmes's*, and wrangled with him for another hour.
You may thank your stars that you are not in a place where you have to ride in
such full horse-cars as these. I rode half way out with my 'form' entirely out
of the car overhanging the road, my feet alone being on the same vertical line
as any part of the car, there being just room for them on the step. Aunt Kate
may and probably WILL have shoot through her prolific mind the supposish: 'How
wrong in him to do sich! for if, while in that posish, he should have a sudden
stroke of paralysis, or faint, his nerveless fingers relaxing their grasp of
the rail, he would fall prostrate to the ground and bust.' To which I reply
that when I go so far as to have a stroke of paralysis, I shall not mind going
a step farther and getting bruised.<p>

<p>

Your next question probably is how are and where are father and mother?...I
think father seems more lively for a few days past and cracks jokes with Harry,
etc. Mother is recovering from one of her indispositions, which she bears like
an angel, doing any amount of work at the same time, putting up cornices and
raking out the garret room like a little buffalo.<p>

<p>

Your next question is, wherever is Harry? I answer: 'He is to Ashburner's, to a
tea-squall in favor of Miss Haggerty.' I declined. He is well; we have had
nothing but invitations--six in three or four days. One, a painted one, from
'Mrs. L---,' whoever she may be. I replied that domestic affliction prevented
me from going, but I would take a pecuniary equivalent instead, viz., To 1
oyster stew--30 cts.; 1 chicken salad--0.50; 1 roll--0.02; 8 ice creams at 20
cts.--0.60; 6 small cakes at 0.05--0.80; 1 pear--$1.50;<p>

I expect momentarily her reply with a check, and when it comes will take you
and Aunt Kate on a tour in Europe and have you examined by the leading
physicians and surgeons of that country.<p>

<p>

M---- L---- came out here and dined with us yesterday of her own accord. I no
longer doubt what I always suspected, her penchant for me, and I don't blame
her for it. Elly Temple stayed here two days, too. She scratched, smote, beat,
and kicked me so that I shall dread to meet her again. What an awful time Bob
&amp; Co. must have had at sea! and how anxious you must have been about them!
With best love to Aunt Kate and yourself, believe me <p>

MY DEAR WENDLE,--<p>

Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten, dass ich so traurig bin, to-night. The
ghosts of the past all start from their unquiet graves and keep dancing a
senseless whirligig around me, so that, after trying in vain to read three
books, to sleep or to think, I clutch the pen and ink and resolve to work off
the fit by a few lines to one of the most obtrusive ghosts of all--namely the
tall and lank one of Charles Street. Good golly! how I would prefer to have
about twenty-four hours talk with you up in that whitely lit-up room--without
the sun rising or the firmament revolving so as to put the gas out, without
sleep, food, clothing or shelter except your whiskey bottle--of which or the
like of which I have not partaken since I have been in these longitudes! I
should like to have you opposite me in any mood, whether the facetiously
discursive, the metaphysically discursive, the personally confidential, or the
jadedly CURSIVE and argumentative--so that the oyster-shells which enclose my
being might slowly turn open on their rigid hinges under the radiation, and the
critter within loll out his dried-up gills into the circumfused ichor of life,
till they grow so fat as not to know themselves again. I feel as if a talk with
you of any kind could not fail to set me on my legs again for three weeks at
least. I have been chewing on two or three dried-up old cuds of ideas I brought
from America with me, till they have disappeared, and the nudity of the cosmos
has got beyond anything I have as yet experienced. I have not succeeded in
finding any companion yet and I feel the want of some outward stimulus in my
Soul. There is a man named Grimm* here, whom my soul loves, but in the way
Emerson speaks of, i.e., like those people we meet on staircases, etc., and who
always ignore our feelings towards them. I don't think we shall ever be able to
establish a straight line of communication between us.<p>

<p>

I don't know how it is I am able to take so little interest in reading this
winter. I marked out a number of books when I first came here, to finish. What
with their heaviness, and the damnable slowness with which the Dutch still
goes, they weigh on me like a haystack. I loathe the thought of them; and yet
they have poisoned my slave of a conscience so that I can't enjoy anything
else. I have reached an age when practical work of some kind clamors to be
done--and I must still wait!<p>

<p>

There! Having worked off that pent up gall of six weeks' accumulation I feel
more genial. I wish I could have some news of you--now that the postage is
lowered to such a ridiculous figure (and no letter is double) there remains no
SHADOW of an excuse for not writing--but still I don't expect anything from
you. I suppose you are sinking ever deeper into the sloughs of the law--yet I
ween the Eternal Mystery still from time to time gives her goad another turn in
the raw she once established between your ribs. Don't let it heal over yet.
When I get home let's establish a philosophical society to have regular
meetings and discuss none but the very tallest and broadest questions--to be
composed of none but the very topmost cream of Boston manhood. It will give
each one a chance to air his own opinion in a grammatical form, and to sneer
and chuckle when he goes home at what damned fools all the other members
are--and may grow into something very important after a sufficient number of
years.<p>

<p>

The German character is without mountains or valleys; its favorite food is
roast veal; and in other lines it prefers whatever may be the analogue
thereof--all which gives life here a certain flatness to the high-tuned
American taste. I don't think any one need care much about coming here unless
he wants to dig very deeply into some exclusive specialty. I have been reading
nothing of any interest but some chapters of physiology. There has a good deal
been doing here of late on the physiology of the senses, overlapping
perception, and consequently, in a measure, the psychological field. I am
wading my way towards it, and if in course of time I strike on anything
exhilarating, I'll let you know.<p>

<p>

I'll now pull up. I don't know whether you take it as a compliment that I
should only write to you when in the dismalest of dumps--perhaps you ought
to--you, the one emergent peak to which I cling when all the rest of the world
has sunk beneath the wave. Believe me, my Wendly boy, what poor possibility of
friendship abides in the crazy frame of W. J. meanders about thy neighborhood.
Good-bye! Keep the same bold front as ever to the Common Enemy--and don't
forget your ally.<p>

                                                               W.J.<p>

<p>

That is, after all, all I wanted to write you and it may float the rest of the
letter. Pray give my warm regards to your father, mother and sister; and my
love to the honest Gray and to Jim Higginson.<p>

<p>

Jan. 4. By a strange coincidence, after writing this last night, I received
yours this morning. Not to sacrifice the postage-stamps which are already on
the envelope (Economical W.!) I don't reopen it. But I will write you again
soon. Meanwhile, bless your heart! thank you! Vide Shakespeare: sonnet XXLX<p>

Gents! entry-thieves--chevaliers d'industrie--well-dressed
swindlers--confidence men--wolfs in sheep's clothing--asses in lions'
skin--gentlemanly pickpockets--beware! The hand of the law is already on your
throats and waits but a wink to be tightened. All the resources of the
immensely powerful corporation of Harvard University have been set in motion,
and concealment of your miserable selves or of the almost equally miserable
(though not as such miserable) goloshes which you stole from our entry on
Sunday night is as impossible as would be the concealment of the State House.
The motive of your precipitate departure from the house became immediately
evident to the remaining guests. But they resolved to IGNORE the matter
provided the overshoes were replaced within a week; if not, no CONSIDERATIONS
WHATEVER will prevent Messrs. Gurney &amp; Perry* from proceeding to treat you
with the utmost severity of the law. It is high time that some of these genteel
adventurers should be made an example of, and your offense just comes in time
to make the cup of public and private forbearance overflow. My father and self
have pledged our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor to see the thing
through with Gurney and Perry, as the credit of our house is involved and we
might ourselves have been losers, not only from you but from the aforesaid G.
and P., who have been heard to go about openly declaring that 'if they had
known the party was going to be that kind of an affair, d---d if they would not
have started off earlier themselves with some of those aristocratic James
overcoats, hats, gloves and canes!'<p>

[The next four letters may be taken from the late 'seventies and early
'eighties--after James had become absorbed in teaching and while he was at work
upon his Psychology and upon his first philosophic papers. It should be
explained with reference to two of them, that he then considered Charles
Renouvier and Shadworth Hodgson to be the most important contributors to
contemporary philosophic discussion. They were both somewhat older men than
himself, Renouvier being, in fact, twenty-seven years older, and Hodgson his
senior by ten years. He had exchanged letters with Renouvier as early as 1872.
In 1881-82 he met and became warmly attached to both men during a winter that
he then spent in visiting European universities and in making the acquaintance
of a number of the British and Continental colleagues whose writings had
interested him. <p>

<p>

Before he made this particular European trip James had undoubtedly been in a
very modest frame of mind about his own equipment for teaching philosophy and
psychology, and had also been uncomfortably conscious of the inadequate way in
which those subjects were then dealt with in most American colleges. But closer
contact with men and methods on the other side of the Atlantic, far from
discouraging him or confirming his misgivings, led him, as will appear in the
next letter but one, to certain comforting conclusions and confirmed him in his
fondness for the liberal atmosphere of Cambridge, and for his place in the
brilliant little group who were then building up the Harvard philosophical
department.]<p>

MY DEAR SIR,--<p>

I am quite overcome by your appreciation of my poor little article in the
Nation. It gratifies me extremely to hear from your own lips that my
apprehension of your thoughts is accurate. In so despicably brief a space as
that which a newspaper affords, I could hardly hope to attain any other quality
than that, and perhaps clearness. I had written another paragraph of pure
eulogy of your powers which the editor suppressed, to my great regret, for want
of room. I need not repeat to you again how grateful I feel to you for all I
have learned from your admirable writings.<p>

<p>

I do what lies in my feeble power to assist the propagation of your works here;
but STUDENTS of philosophy are rare here as everywhere. It astonishes me
nevertheless that you have had to wait so long for general recognition. Only a
few months ago I had the pleasure of introducing to your Essais two professors
of philosophy, able and learned men, who hardly knew your name!! But I am
perfectly convinced that it is a mere affair of time, and that you will take
your place in the general History of Speculation as the classical and finished
representative of the tendency which was begun by Hume, and to which writers
before you had made only fragmentary contributions, whilst you have fused the
whole matter into a solid, elegant and definitive system, perfectly consistent,
and capable, by reason of its moral vitality, of becoming popular, so far as
that is permitted to philosophic systems. After your Essays, it seems to me
that the only important question is the deepest one of all, the one between the
principle of contradiction, and the Sein und Nichts.* You have brought it to
that clear issue; and extremely as I value your logical attitude, it would be
uncandid of me (after what I have said) not to confess that there are certain
psychological and moral facts, which make me, as I stand to-day, unable wholly
to commit myself to your position, to burn my ships behind me, and proclaim the
belief in the ONE and the many to be the Original Sin of the mind.<p>

<p>

I long for leisure to study up these questions. I have been teaching anatomy
and physiology in Harvard College here. Next year, I add a course of
physiological psychology, using, for certain practical reasons, Spencer's
Psychology textbook. My health is not strong, I find that laboratory work and
study too are more than I can attend to. It is therefore not impossible that I
may in 1877-8 be transferred to the philosophical department, in which there is
likely to be a vacancy. If so, you may depend upon it that the name of
Renouvier will be as familiar as that of Descartes to the Bachelors of Arts who
leave these walls. Believe me with the greatest respect and gratitude,<p>

                                              Faithfully yours,<p>

                                                         WM. JAMES.<p>

<p>

I must add a vivat to your Critique Philosophique, which keeps up so ably and
bravely. And although it is probably an entirely superfluous recommendation, I
cannot refrain from calling your attention to the most robust of English
philosophic writers, Hodgson, whose Time and Space was published in 1865 by
Longmans, and whose Theory of Practice in two volumes followed it in 1870.<p>

DEAR H.,--<p>

Found at Hottinguer's this A.M. your letter with all the enclosures--and a wail
you had sent to Berlin. Also six letters from my wife and seven or eight
others, not counting papers and magazines. I will mail you back yours and
Father's letter to me. Alice speaks of Father's indubitable improvement in
strength, but our sister Alice apparently is somewhat run down. Paris looks
delicious. I shall try to get settled as soon as possible, and meanwhile feel
as if the confusion of life was recommencing. I saw in Germany all the men I
cared to see and talked with most of them. With three or four I had a really
nutritious time. The trip has amply paid for itself. I found 3rd class
'Nichtraucher' almost always empty and perfectly comfortable. The great use of
such experiences is less the definite information you gain from any one, than a
sort of solidification of your own foothold on life. Nowhere did I see a
university which seems to do for ALL its students anything like what Harvard
does. Our methods throughout are better. It is only in the select 'Seminaria'
(private classes) that a few German students, making researches with the
professor, gain something from him personally which his genius alone can give.
I certainly got a most distinct impression of my own INFORMATION in regard to
MODERN philosophic matters being broader than that of any one I met, and of our
Harvard post of observation being more cosmopolitan. Delboeuf in Liege was an
angel and much the best teacher I've seen.<p>

<p>

The Century, with your fiery good portrait, etc., was at Hottinguer's this
A.M., sent by my wife. I shall read it presently. I'm off now to see if I can
get your leather trunk, sent front London, arrested by inundations and ordered
to be returned to Paris. I never needed its contents a second. And in your
little American valise, and my flabby black hand-bag and shawl-straps and a
small satchel, I carried not only everything I used, but collected a whole
library of books in Leipsig, some pieces of Venetian glass in their balky
bolsters of seaweed, a quart bottle of eau de Cologne, and a lot of other
acquisitions. I feel remarkably tough now and fairly ravenous for my
psychologic work. Address Hottinguer's.<p>

<p>

MY DEAR HODGSON,--<p>

I have just read your 'Philosophy and Experience' address, and re-read with
much care your 'Dialogue on Free Will' in the last Mind. I thank you kindly for
the address. But is n't philosophy a sad mistress, estranging the more
intimately those who in all other respects are most intimately united--although
't is true she unites them afresh by their very estrangement! I feel for the
first time now, after these readings, as if I might be catching sight of your
foundations. Always hitherto has there been something elusive, a sense that
what I caught could not be all. Now I feel as if it might be all, and yet for
me 't is not enough. Your 'method' (which surely after this needs no additional
expository touch) I seem at last to understand, but it shrinks in the
understanding....<p>

<p>

As for the Free Will article, I have very little to say; for it leaves entirely
untouched what seems to me the only living issue involved. The paper is an
exquisite piece of literary goldsmith's work,--nothing like it in that respect
since Berkeley,--but it hangs in the air of speculation and touches not the
earth of life, and the beautiful distinctions it keeps making gratify only the
understanding which has no end in view but to exercise its eyes by the way. The
distinctions between vis impressa and vis insita, and compulsion and 'reaction'
MEAN nothing in a monistic world; and any world is a monism in which the parts
to come are, as they are in your world, absolutely involved and presupposed in
the parts that are already given. Were such a monism a palpable optimism, no
man would be so foolish as to care whether it was predetermined or not, or to
ask whether he was or was not what you call a 'real agent.' He would acquiesce
in the flow and drift of things of which he found himself a part, and rejoice
that it was such a whole. The question of free will owes its entire being to a
difficulty you disdain to notice, namely that we CANNOT rejoice in such a
whole, for it is NOT a palpable optimism and yet, if it be predetermined, we
MUST TREAT it as a whole. Indeterminism is the only way to BREAK the world into
good parts and into bad, and to stand by the former as against the latter.<p>

<p>

I can understand the determinism of the mere mechanical intellect which will
not hear of a moral dimension to existence. I can understand that of mystical
monism, shutting its eyes on the concretes of life for the sake of its abstract
rupture. I can understand that of mental defeat and despair saying, 'It's all a
muddle, and here I go, along with it.' I can NOT understand a determinism like
yours, which rejoices in clearness and distinctions, and which is at the same
time alive to moral ones--unless it be that the latter are purely speculative
for it, and have little to do with its real feeling of the way life is made
up.<p>

<p>

For life IS evil. Two souls are in my breast; I see the better, and in the very
act of seeing it I do the worse. To say that the molecules of the nebula
implied this and SHALL HAVE IMPLIED IT to all eternity, so often as it recurs,
is to condemn me to that 'dilemma' of pessimism or subjectivism of which I once
wrote, and which seems to have so little urgency to you, and to which all talk
about abstractions erected into entities, and compulsion vs. 'freedom' is
simply irrelevant. What living man cares for such niceties when the real
problem stares him in the face, of how practically to meet a world foredone,
with no possibilities left in it?<p>

<p>

What a mockery then seems your distinction between determination and
compulsion, between passivity and an 'activity' every minutest feature of which
is preappointed, both as to its whatness and as to its thatness, by what went
before? What an insignificant difference then the difference between
'impediments from within' and 'impediments from without'--between being fated
to do the thing WILLINGLY or not! The point is not as to how it is done, but as
to its being done at all. It seems a wrong complement to the rest of life,
which rest of life (according to your precious 'free-will determinism,' as to
any other fatalism), whilst shrieking aloud at its WHATNESS, nevertheless
exacts rigorously its THATNESS then and there. Is that a reasonable world from
the moral point of view? And is it made more reasonable by the fact that when I
brought about the THATNESS of the evil WHATNESS decreed to come by the thatness
of all else beside, I did so consentingly and aware of no 'impediments outside
of my own nature'? With what can I SIDE in such a world as this? this monstrous
indifferentism which brings forth everything eodum jure? Our nature demands
something OBJECTIVE to take sides with. If the world is a Unit of this sort
there ARE no sides--there's the moral rub! And you don't see it!<p>

<p>

Ah, Hodgson! Hodgson mio! from whom I hoped so much! Most spirited, most clean,
most thoroughbred of philosophers! Perche di tanto inganni i figlii tuoi? If
you want to reconcile us rationally to Determinism, write a Theodicy, reconcile
us to Evil, but don't talk of the distinction between impediments from within
and without when the within and the without of which you speak are both within
that WHOLE which is the only real agent in your philosophy. There is no such
superstition as the idolatry of the Whole.<p>

I originally finished this letter on sheet number one; but it occurred to me
afterwards that the end was too short, so I scratched out the first lines of
the crossed writing, and refer you now to what follows them.--[Lines from sheet
number 1] It makes me sick at heart, this discord among the only men who ought
to agree. I am the more sick this moment as I must write to your ancient foe
(at least the stimulus to an old Mind article of yours), One F. E. Abbot, who
recently gave me his little book Scientific Theism--the burden of his
life--which makes me groan that I cannot digest a word of it. Farewell! Heaven
bless you all the same, and enable you to forgive me. We are well and I hope
you are the same.<p>

MY DEAR STUMPF,--<p>

Your two letters, from Rugen of Sept. 8th, and from Halle of Jan. 2, came duly,
and I can assure you that their contents were most heartily appreciated, and
not by me alone. I fairly squealed with pleasure over the first one and its
rich combination of good counsel and humorous commentary, and read the greater
part of it to my friend Royce, assistant professor of philosophy here, who
enjoyed it almost as much as I. There is a heartiness and solidity about your
letters which is truly German, and makes them as nutritious as they are
refreshing to receive.<p>

<p>

Your Kater-Gefuhl, however, in your second letter, about your Auslassungen* on
the subject of Wundt, amused me by its speedy evolution into Auslassungen more
animated still. I can well understand why Wundt should make his compatriots
impatient. Foreigners can afford to be indifferent, for he does n't crowd them
so much. He aims at being a sort of Napoleon of the intellectual world.
Unfortunately he will never have a Waterloo, for he is a Napoleon without
genius and with no central idea which, if defeated, brings down the whole
fabric in ruin. You remember what Victor Hugo says of Napoleon, in the
Miserables--'Il genait Dieu'; Wundt only geners his confreres; and whilst they
make mincemeat of some one of his views by their criticism, he is meanwhile
writing a book on an entirely different subject. Cut him up like a worm, and
each fragment crawls; there is no noeud vital in his mental medulla oblongata,
so that you can't kill him all at once.<p>

<p>

But surely you must admit that, since there must be professors in the world,
Wundt is the most praiseworthy and never-too-much-to-be-respected type of the
species. He is n't a genius, he is a professor--a being whose duty is to know
everything, and have his own opinion about everything, connected with his Fach.
[Field] Wundt has the most prodigious faculty of appropriating and preserving
knowledge, and as for opinions, he takes au grand serieux his duties there. He
says of each possible subject, 'Here I must have an opinion. Let's see! what
shall it be? How many possible opinions are there? three? four? Yes! just four!
Shall I take one of these? It will seem more original to take a higher
position, a sort of Vermittelungs-ansicht [Mediating attitude] between them
all. THAT I will do,' etc., etc.<p>

<p>

So he acquires a complete assortment of opinions of his own; and, as his memory
is so good, he seldom forgets which they are. But this is not reprehensible; it
is admirable--from the professorial point of view. To be sure, one gets tired
of that point of view after a while. But was there ever, since Christian
Wolff's time, such a model of the German Professor? He has utilized to the
uttermost fibre every gift that Heaven endowed him with at his birth, and made
of it all that mortal pertinacity could make. He is the finished example of how
much mere EDUCATION can do for a man. Beside him, Spencer is an ignoramus as
well as a charlatan. I admit that Spencer is occasionally more AMUSING than
Wundt. His Data of Ethics seems to me incomparably his best book, because it is
a more or less frank expression of the man's personal ideal of living--which
has of course little to do with science, and which, in Spencer's case, is full
of definiteness and vigor. Wundt's Ethics I have not yet seen, and probably
shall not 'tackle' it for a good while to come.<p>

<p>

I was much entertained by your account of F--, of whom you have seen much more
than I have. I am eager to see him, to hear about his visit to Halle, and to
get his account of you. But [F----'s place of abode] and Boston are ten hours
asunder by rail, and I never go there and he never comes here. He seems a very
promising fellow, with a good deal of independence of character; and if you
knew the conditions of education in this country, and of preparation to fill
chairs of philosophy in colleges, you would not express any surprise at his, or
mine, or any other American's, small amount of 'Information uber die
Philosophische Literatur.' Times are mending, however, and within the past six
or eight years it has been possible, in three or four of our colleges, to get
really educated for philosophy as a profession.<p>

<p>

The most promising man we have in this country is, in my opinion, the
above-mentioned Royce, a young Californian of thirty, who is really built for a
metaphysician, and who is besides that a very complete human being, alive at
every point. He wrote a novel last summer which is now going through the press,
and which I am very curious to see. He has just been in here, interrupting this
letter, and I have told him he must send a copy of his book, the Religious
Aspect of Philosophy, to you, promising to urge you to read it when you had
time. The first half is ethical, and very readable and full of profound and
witty details, but to my mind not of vast importance philosophically. The
second half is a new argument for monistic idealism, an argument based on the
possibility of truth and error in knowledge, subtle in itself, and rather
lengthily expounded, but seeming to me to be one of the few big original
suggestions of recent philosophical writing. I have vainly tried to escape from
it, I still suspect it of inconclusiveness, but I frankly confess that I am
UNABLE to overthrow it. Since you too are an anti-idealist, I wish very much
you would try your critical teeth upon it. I can assure you that, if you come
to close quarters with it, you will say its author belongs to the genuine
philosophic breed.<p>

<p>

I am myself doing very well this year, rather light work, etc., but still
troubled with bad sleep so as to advance very slowly with private study and
writing. However, few days without a line at least. I found to my surprise and
pleasure that Robertson was willing to print my chapter on Space, in Mind, even
though it should run through all four numbers of the year. So I sent it to him.
Most of it was written six or even seven years ago. To tell the truth, I am off
of Space now, and can probably carry my little private ingenuity concerning it
no farther than I have already done in this essay; and fearing that some evil
fiend might put it into Helmholtz's mind to correct all his errors and tell the
full truth in the new edition of his Optics, I felt it was high time that what
I had written should see the light and not be lost. It is dry stuff to read,
and I hardly dare to recommend it to you; but if you do read it, there is no
one whose favorable opinion I should more rejoice to hear; for, as you know,
you seem to me, of all writers on Space, the one who, on the whole, has thought
out the subject most philosophically. Of course, the experimental patience, and
skill and freshness of observation of the Helmholtzes and Herings are
altogether admirable, and perhaps at bottom worth more than philosophic
ability. Space is really a direfully difficult subject!<p>

the third dimension bothers me very much still....<p>

[During the very hard-working period of the 'eighties James had little time for
long letters, but the short notes and the post-cards which he threw off daily
were perhaps the more vivid for that fact. He was almost certain to respond
with a word of comment to whatever interested him, and a book which he had
enjoyed often called forth what Mr. Howells once called 'a whoop of blessing'
to its author.]<p>

MY DEAR HOWELLS,--<p>

I 'snatch' a moment from the limitless vacation peace and leisure in which I
lie embedded and which does n't leave me 'time' for anything, to tell you that
I have been reading your Indian Summer, and that it has given me about as
exquisite a kind of delight as anything I ever read in my life, in the line to
which it belongs. How you tread the narrow line of nature's truth so infallibly
is more than I can understand. Then the profanity, the humor, the humanity, the
morality--the everything! In short, 't is cubical, and set it up any way you
please, 't will stand. That blessed young female made me squeal at every page.
How can you have got back to the conversations of our prime?<p>

<p>

But I won't discriminate or analyze. This is only meant for an inarticulate cry
of viva Howells. I repeat it: long live Howells! God grant you may do as good
things again! I don't believe you can do better.<p>

<p>

With warmest congratulations to Mrs. Howells that you AND she were born, I am
ever yours,<p>

It would take G[uy] de M[aupassant] himself to just fill a post-card chok-full,
and yet leave naught to be desired, with an account of Pierre et Jean. It is a
little cube of bronze; or, like the body of the Capitaine Beausire, 'plein
comme un oeuf, dur comme une balle'--dur surtout! Fifteen years ago, I might
have been ENTHUSED by such art; but I'm growing weak-minded, and the charm of
this admirable precision and adequacy of art to subject leaves me too cold. It
is like these modern tools and instruments, so admirably compact, and strong,
and reduced to their fighting weight--one of those little metallic pumps, e.g.,
so oily &amp; powerful, with a handle about two feet long, which will throw a
column of water about 4 inches thick 100 feet. Unfortunately G. de M.'s pump
only throws dirty water--and I am BEGINNING to be old fogy eno' to like even an
old, shackly, wooden pump-handle, if the water it fetches only carries all the
sweetness of the mountain-side. Yrs. ever, W. J.<p>

MY DEAR HOWELLS--<p>

You are a sublime and immortal genius! I have just read Silas Lapham and Lemuel
Barker,--strange that I should not have read them before, after hearing my wife
rave about them so,--and of all the perfect works of fiction they are the
perfectest. The truth, in gross and in detail; the concreteness and solidity;
the geniality, humanity, and unflagging humor; the steady way in which it keeps
up without a dead paragraph; and especially the fidelity with which you stick
to the ways of human nature, with the ideal and the unideal inseparably beaten
up together so that you never give them 'clear'--all make them a feast of
delight, which, if I mistake not, will last for all future time, or as long as
novels can last. Silas is the bigger total success because it deals with a more
important story. I think you ought to have made young Corey angrier about
Irene's mistake and its consequences, but the work on the much obstructed
Lemuel surely was never surpassed. I hope his later life was happy!<p>

<p>

Altogether you ought to be happy--you can fold your arms and write no more if
you like. I've just got your Criticism and Fiction, which shall speedily be
read. And whilst in the midst of this note have received from the postman your
clipping from Kate Field's Washington, the author of which I can't divine, but
she's a blessed creature whoever she is. Yours ever,<p>

                                             WM. JAMES.<p>

[No picture of James's life would be fair which ignored its domestic side. He
married in 1878, and his marriage was happy in the fullest sense. By 1891, the
date which these letters have reached, four children were growing up; he had
built himself a house in Cambridge, and had also acquired a little place at
Chocorua, where he spent most of each summer with his family. This bundle of
letters may fittingly close with three which were addressed to his sister and
his two little boys. It need only be explained that the sister was living in
England and had consequently never seen the Chocorua place, 'Mrs. Gibbens' and
'Margaret' were his mother-in-law and sister-in-law.<p>

                                                   CAMBRIDGE, Feb. 1887.<p>

<p>

We are getting along very well, on the whole, I keeping very continuously
occupied, but not seeming to get ahead much, for the days GROW SO SHORT with
each advancing year. A day is now about a minute--hardly time to turn round in.
Mrs. Gibbens arrived from Chicago last night; and in ten days she and Margaret
will start, with our little Billy, for Aiken, S.C., to be gone till May. B. is
asthmatic, she is glad to go south for her own sake, and the open-air life all
day long will be much better for him than our arduous winter and spring. He is
the most utterly charming little piece of human nature you ever saw, so packed
with life, impatience, and feeling, that I think father must have been just
like him at his age....<p>

<p>

I have been paying ten or eleven visits to a mind-cure doctress, a sterling
creature, resembling the Venus of Medicine, Mrs Lydia E. Pinkham, made solid
and veracious-looking. I sit down beside her and presently drop asleep, whilst
she disentangles the snarls out of my mind. She says she never saw a mind with
so many, so agitated, so restless, etc. She said my EYES, mentally speaking,
kept revolving like wheels in front of each other and in front of my face, and
it was four or five sittings ere she could get them FIXED. I am now,
UNCONSCIOUSLY TO MYSELF, much better than when I first went, etc. I thought it
might please you to hear an opinion of my mind so similar to your own.
Meanwhile what boots it to be made unconsciously better, yet all the while
consciously to lie awake o' nights as I still do?--<p>

<p>

Lectures are temporarily stopped and examinations begun. I seized the
opportunity to go to my Chocorua place and see just what was needed to make it
habitable for the summer. It is a goodly little spot, but we may not, after
all, fit up the buildings till we have spent a summer in the place and
'studied' the problem a little more closely. The snow was between two and three
feet deep on a level, in spite of the recent thaws. The day after I arrived was
one of the most crystalline purity, and the mountain simply exquisite in
gradations of tint. I have a tenant in the house, one Sanborn, who owes me a
dollar and a half a month, but can't pay it, being of a poetic and
contemplative rather than of an active nature, and consequently excessively
poor. He has a sign out, 'Attorney and Pension Agent,' and writes and talks
like one of the greatest of men. He was working the sewing-machine when I was
there, and talking of his share in the war, and why he did n't go to live in
Boston, etc., --namely that he was n't known,--and my heart was heavy in my
breast that so rich a nature, fitted to inhabit a tropical dreamland, should
have nothing but that furnitureless cabin within and snow and sky without to
live upon. For, however spotlessly pure and dazzlingly lustrous snow may be,
pure snow, always snow, and naught but snow, for four months on end, is, it
must be confessed, a rather lean diet for the human soul--deficient in variety,
chiaroscuro, and oleaginous and mediaeval elements. I felt as I was returning
home that some intellectual inferiority ought to accrue to all populations
whose environment for many months in the year consisted of pure snow. You are
better off,--better off than you know,--in that great, black-earthed dunghill
of an England. I say naught of politics, wars, strikes, railroad accidents or
public events, unless the departure of C. W. Eliot and his wife for a year in
Europe, be a public event.....<p>

BELOVED HEINRICH,--<p>

You lazy old scoundrel, why don't you write a letter to your old Dad? Tell me
how you enjoy your riding on horseback, what Billy does for a living, and which
things you like best of all the new kinds of things you have to do with in
Aiken. How do you like the darkeys being so numerous? Everything goes on
quietly here. The house so still that you can hear a pin drop, and so clean
that everything makes a mark on it. All because there are no brats and kids
around. Jap is my only companion, and he sneezes all over me whenever I pick
him up. Mrs. Hildreth and the children are gone to Florida. The Emmets seem
very happy. I will close with a fable. A donkey felt badly because he was not
so great a favorite as a lapdog. He said, I must act like the lap-dog, and then
my mistress will like me. So he came into the house and began to lick his
mistress, and put his paws on her, and tried to get into her lap. Instead of
kissing him for this, she screamed for the servants, who beat him and put him
out of the house. Moral: It's no use to try to be anything but a donkey if you
are one. But neither you nor Billy are one. Good-night! you blessed boy. Stick
to your three R's and your riding, so as to get on FAST.<p>

<p>

The ancient Persians only taught their boys to ride, to shoot the bow and to
tell the truth. Good-night!<p>

BELOVED WILLIAMSON,--<p>

This is Sunday, the sabbath of the Lord, and it has been very hot for two days.
I think of you and Harry with such longing, and of that infant whom I know so
little, that I cannot help writing you some words. Your Mammy writes me that
she can't get YOU to WORK much; though Harry works. You MUST work a little this
summer in our own place. How nice it will be! I have wished that both you and
Harry were by my side in some amusements which I have had lately. First, the
learned seals in a big tank of water in Boston. The loveliest beasts, with big
black eyes, poking their heads up and down in the water, and then scrambling
out on their bellies like boys tied up in bags. They play the guitar and banjo
and organ; and one of them saves the life of a child who tumbles in the water,
catching him by the collar with its teeth, and swimming him ashore. They are
both, child and seal, trained to do it. When they have done well, their master
gives them a lot of fish. They eat an awful lot;--scales, and fins, and bones
and all, without chewing. That is the worst thing about them. He says he never
beats them. They are full of curiosity--more so than a dog for far-off things;
for when a man went round the room with a pole pulling down the windows at the
top, all their heads bobbed out of the water and followed him about with their
eyes aus lauter curiosity. Dogs would hardly have noticed him, I think.<p>

<p>

Now, speaking of dogs, Jap was NAUSEATED two days ago. I thought, from his
licking his nose, that he was going to be sick, and got him out of doors just
in time. He vomited most awfully on the grass. He then acted as if he thought I
was going to punish him, poor thing. He can't discriminate between sickness and
sin. He leads a dull life, without you and Margaret Mary. I tell him if it
lasts much longer, he'll grow into a common beast; he hates to be a beast, but
unless he has human companionship, he will sink to the level of one. So you
must hasten back and make much of him.<p>

<p>

I also went to the panorama of the battle of Bunker Hill, which is as good as
that of Gettysburg. I wished Harry had been there because he knows the, story
of it. You and he shall go soon after your return. It makes you feel just as if
you lived there.<p>

<p>

Well, I will now stop. On Monday Morning the 14th, or Sunday night the 15th of
May, I will take you into my arms; that is, I will meet you with a carriage on
the wharf, when the boat comes in. And I tell you I shall be glad to see the
whole lot of you come roaring home. Give my love to your Mammy, to Aunt
Margaret, to Fraulein, to Harry, to Margaret Mary, and to yourself.<p>

                                      Your loving Dad,<p>

                                                     WM. JAMES.

	<font size=5>O</font>NE must not underestimate the
French, but perhaps their reputation for being impossible needs re-examining.
In theory, you cannot slip an opinion across a French caf&eacute; counter
without being challenged. So when a single Frenchman gets away with imposing
his taste and vision on something as fundamental as Paris--indeed, with
changing the face of the French capital to suit himself--one is inclined to
wonder how he did it.<p>

With the departure of President Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand, Paris has come to
the end of a grand age of architectural renewal. The scope has been colossal.
In architectural terms the City of Light slept for the better part of a century
after a pair of world exhibitions, in 1889 and 1900, gave it the Eiffel Tower,
the Grand Palais, and other wonders. These appeared scarcely a generation after
Emperor Napoleon III had Baron Georges Eug&egrave;ne Haussmann tear up the
capital and crisscross it with boulevards. Now, from east to west, the
cityscape has changed once more. The world's most visited city has never had
more to admire, or at least to gawk at.<p>

That the change happened so fast--well within two decades--and on so vast a
scale explains better than any reading of the French constitution how
incorrigibly imperial are the powers of a French leader. Without the tiring
distraction of debate in Parliament, a good $6 billion of taxpayers' money was
spent at the President's personal behest on the renewal of Paris: a splendid
revamping of the Louvre, a monumental national library in the east, a celestial
arch in the west, an opera house at the Bastille, and enough striking novelties
in between to shake up every tourist's yellowing fantasies of the city.<p>

If this were America, Congress would still be haggling over the opera-house
staircase. State architectural sprees do not happen in America. Nor do they in
England or Germany or the capitals of most places like them--which may be the
worse for it.<p>

In most democratic countries these days, prestige-building is privately
financed. Queen Elizabeth was required to dip into her own purse to repair
Windsor Castle after it burned. This is not the French way. Bernard Latarget,
Mitterrand's construction chamberlain, was still smiling at remarks to the
effect that his boss was a latter-day pharaoh when I interviewed him in his
office as Mitterrand's reign came to a close. Looking out over the leafy lower
reaches of the Champs Elys&eacute;es and the handsome roof of the Grand Palais,
Latarget was at pains to indicate that culture has an essential place in French
public life--is, indeed, an essential public service, like health, education,
and transport. He said, "You do not leave such things to private enterprise."
Certainly, Latarget conceded, the age of construction bore Mitterrand's
personal crest. Certainly his personal tastes and ambitions were on display.
But that was not like Louis XIV's having created Versailles for himself.
Mitterrand had not built himself a ch&acirc;teau to live in. His <i>grands
travaux</i> were for the glory of France, and in most cases they met pressing
needs.<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE renewal of Paris started a few years before Mitterrand's fourteen-year
presidency got under way. Its origins were in the soaring of presidential
authority that followed Charles de Gaulle's decision to write a new
constitution, in 1958, and thus get himself elected President by direct popular
vote, in 1965. From then on the President enjoyed powers comparable to those of
the old Kings of France.<p>
 
Fittingly, De Gaulle the democrat was a born autocrat. This revealed itself in
memorable ways. For one thing, he had no time for Parliament and political
parties. "The more decrees and the less legislation we have the better" was the
great man's intimate view on government, as cited in a recent book by Alain
Peyrefitte, who served as his Information Minister. One could imagine such a
man rebuilding Paris to his own specifications in a trice. But the task De
Gaulle set himself was to rebuild the nation, not its capital.<p>

His successor, the ex-banker Georges Pompidou, used the enhanced authority of
the presidency to destroy Paris. Of course, he did not see his contribution
quite that way. During his term, from 1969 to 1974, his goal was to modernize
the capital in order to make it easier to get around by car. He dreamed of a
freeway along the Seine past the Latin Quarter. The high esteem he had for his
own artistic taste encouraged him to experiment. Property speculation ran wild
as aimless high-rises sprang up. Pompidou had the old marketplace of Les Halles
and its unforgettable wrought-iron pavilions demolished in favor of an
underground commercial maze. It is true that Zola's Belly of Paris had become
too cramped and inaccessible to continue as the wholesale-food hub for a
metropolis. But the place where Paris famously lived through the night has
deteriorated over the years into a nighttime no-go area.<p>

Poor Pompidou is remembered as an architectural Attila because of Les Halles,
so there is some irony to the fact that the nearby Centre Pompidou is named
after him. The contemporary-art showplace may be something of an eyesore (the
"oil refinery," as Parisians call it, gets thumbs down from taxi drivers, the
acknowledged arbiters of popular taste), but it occupies a large place in the
age of <i>grands travaux</i>. Indeed, the center launched the age. Pompidou had
been dead for three years when it opened, in 1977, by which time his
conservative successor, Val&eacute;ry Giscard d'Estaing, was devoting himself
to halting the all-out modernization drive. This was a genuine public service,
but it thwarted any building ambitions of his own the haughty Giscard may have
had--as did an abrupt change in the way Paris was run.<p>

Partway through Giscard's presidency Paris elected itself a mayor for the first
time, in the person of Jacques Chirac, who was then the leader of the powerful
Gaullist Party and is today France's new President. From time immemorial the
State--Kings, Emperors, republican governments--had ruled Paris. Now it was
ruled by an executive mayor, and His Honor needed to be consulted, even by the
President of the Republic. Chirac, a political rival of Giscard's, got in his
way, niggling over things like building permits and zoning rights. In the end
Giscard made do by embellishing what was already there--in particular by
transforming the old Orsay railway terminal on the Left Bank from a handsome
Belle Epoque relic into the Orsay Museum. He also began turning the abandoned
municipal slaughterhouses at La Villette, in the north, into a science park and
exhibition ground, a job Mitterrand completed.<p>

By the time Mitterrand came to power, in 1981, the design of a prestigious
building was supposed to be put out for bid, with a jury choosing the winning
architect. Mitterrand, who as a man of letters had some reason to trust his own
taste, merely kept up appearances when it came to this nicety. In one way or
another he made the choices himself. For a man bent on leaving his mark on
history, in these times it seemed a safer bet to leave a building or two than a
treaty or two. There was nothing very grand about Mitterrand and his
<i>travaux</i>, however, until he decided to remake the Louvre.<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE Louvre was a mummy among the world's leading museums. Half the space in the
former royal palace was taken up by the Finance Ministry, and the rest was
notoriously run down. It had no entryway to speak of. Mitterrand decided that
the architect for the job was the American I. M. Pei. Mitterrand was
open-minded in choosing an American. Pei was less so: he declined to go through
the motions of competing for the $1.2 billion contract. Unperturbed, Mitterrand
told him, <i>Eh bien!</i> Go ahead.<p>

The result is the resplendent glass pyramid in the Louvre courtyard, a unique
entry to a renovated and spacious museum (the Finance Ministry was kicked out)
that now attracts some 40 percent more visitors than it did before. The pyramid
was not at all sure to please the conservative French. Nor did it. When first
glimpsed, it caused caf&eacute;-counter brawls across France. But Frenchmen
clashed over the aspect and the appropriateness of Pei's masterstroke--not over
the cost. And having grown accustomed to it, they love it. "Someone has to take
the big decisions on monuments," says Emile Biasini, the resourceful man whom
Mitterrand installed in his government as Minister of Grand Works. "Otherwise,
it's like television. Let the public choose, and the level of programs goes
down."<p>

Biasini's strategy was to use the will of the President as his bulldozer. He
worked things out with Mayor Chirac so that city hall got out of the way. "I
told Chirac the State was paying. He's no fool. He saw the advantages for
Paris."<p>

The success of the Louvre project gave Mitterrand a free hand to build. As long
as his Socialist Party had a majority in Parliament, as it had most of the
time, no one demurred; and when it did not have a majority, his projects were
usually too far advanced to be stopped. Members of his court say that he did
not set out to emulate past builder-Kings--the idea just grew on him. And it
had the time to grow: not many elected national leaders have fourteen years to
work with. Mitterrand's real whopper ($1.5 billion) is the Biblioth&egrave;que
de France, the largest book archive on earth in dimension, replacing the
hopelessly cramped National Library, near the original Opera. The
Biblioth&egrave;que, which has a pine forest planted amid its four glass
towers, each in the form of an open book and a good deal higher than the Arc de
Triomphe, opens up decrepit east Paris along the Seine, a mile upstream from
Notre Dame, like the sun appearing through a junkyard. The steps that descend
to the Seine along its quarter-mile length are made of ipe,<i> </i>an Amazonian
hardwood. Parisians call it the TGB (<i>tr&egrave;s grande
biblioth&egrave;que</i>), in a tilt of the hat to the high-speed TGV train
network, the height of French go-aheadness. The building was finished just in
time for Mitterrand to inaugurate it before he stepped down, in May, though it
will be at least a year until the library opens for business.<p>

Mitterrand chose the design for its grandeur, without consulting the academic
grandees who monopolized the old library it replaces. The project's young
French architect, Dominique Perrault, did not consult them either. Mitterrand
aimed to open his library to the public, and did not want the intellectual
elite to get in the way. An unholy wrangle was likely, and it occurred. The
architect's glass towers would literally have burned the books in high summer.
To prevent that, the towers had to be insulated with an interior concrete wall
encased in wooden shutters. Also, two floors were lopped off each tower; no
one, it seems, can quite remember why. "They were a bone thrown to a dog to
stop it from snarling," says Dominique Jamet, who was the original head of the
library project. Jamet was so badly bruised by the academic brigade that
Mitterrand retired him mid-contest.<p>

<font size=5>I</font>N my view, France will come to like the TGB a lot--as much as it likes Pei's
pyramid and the marble Grande Arche, which form the new ends of an extended
east-west axis along which lie the Place de la Concorde, the Champs
Elys&eacute;es, and the Arc de Triomphe. The Centre Pompidou earns some
sympathy for its quirkiness, and the modernistic new Finance Ministry, another
Mitterrand project, forming a high arch over the road along the Seine, into
which one side of the arch is sunk, is mercifully unobtrusive. Only
Mitterrand's cheap-looking Bastille Opera ranks as a popular flop--such a flop,
in fact, that those close to Mitterrand blame not Mitterrand but the busybody
Jack Lang, his longtime Culture Minister, for this ungrand affair. Yet even a
mistake of this dimension is happily forgiven by a tolerant public. In touring
the <i>grands travaux </i>I met not a soul who suggested that the billions
might have been spent on shrinking France's social-security deficit or on some
other desperate national problem.<p>

"Imagine putting aesthetic choices to a vote in the French Parliament," the
injured Jamet muses. "Nothing would ever get done. At least from a monarch you
get a decision. It is a very positive system in its way. The French are
complainers, anarchists, individualists, and so on, but they have an enormous
respect for grandeur."<p>

Not just respect but a passion. The new President, who as mayor kept the
streets of Paris remarkably clean, has scant space, either geographic or
psychological, to pursue the age of renewal. Surely, it is over. At last the
publishers can put out their definitive Paris guides. The fact remains that a
French President can impose almost anything on the French if he wraps it up as
essential to the nation's <i>gloire</i>. The French display more concern than
most for liberty, and a little less than most for democracy. All the better for
us tourists. If other rich nations conducted themselves less democratically,
they might have capital cities to compare to Paris.

conclusions from epidemiologic reports</i></font></center><p>

	</pre>

	

	

	<font size=5>I</font>t's tempting to develop an immunity to health reporting. Many of us believe

that today's ominous medical advisory will become tomorrow's tired joke, along

the lines of the rat who has to drink a thousand cans of diet soda a day to get

cancer. We're hardened to reports of health hazards, and have come to expect

warnings to be quickly overruled by future research. This is a dangerous

assumption, however. Frequently the error is not in the research but in its

interpretation.<p>



<p>



Epidemiologic evidence is particularly prone to this problem. Epidemiology, the

study of the causes and patterns of disease in human populations, is

misunderstood so often precisely because it appears to be so accessible. The

epidemiologist's job can be likened to that of a detective--he cracks the code

of the disease by uncovering its mode of operation. To do this, an

epidemiologist can do several things. One is to follow a large group of people

for a long period of time, see what diseases they develop, and then correlate

the diseases with other factors in their lives. An example of such a "cohort

study" is the Framingham heart study, in which a sample of the adult population

of Framingham, Massachusetts, has been followed since 1948, in order to tease

out factors that influence their risk of heart disease. Another epidemiologic

method, called the case-control approach, involves comparing victims of a

particular disease or condition with people who don't have it, and looking for

a significant difference between the groups in some variable like diet, living

conditions, age, or ethnic background. An example would be a study published in

1979 in The Lancet, for which the researchers had looked at oral-contraceptive

use by a group of women who had suffered heart attacks and by another group who

hadn't.<p>



<p>



The purpose of both approaches is to piece together a pattern that will point

to the underlying cause, or causes, of a particular disease or syndrome. An

individual study provides clues but is not designed to provide proof that a

particular disease is caused or prevented by a particular agent. Since

epidemiologic research involves people rather than laboratory animals, it is

especially tempting to extrapolate from the sample in a particular study to the

public. This is generally a mistake.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE recent front-page reports of a link between breast cancer and moderate

alcohol consumption offer an excellent example of how misleading such

extrapolations can be. The studies prompting the headlines, published last May

in The New England Journal of Medicine, were done by Dr. Arthur Schatzkin, a

senior staff fellow at the National Cancer Institute, and Dr. Walter Willett,

an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health.

Both were cohort studies. Both found an association between moderate alcohol

consumption--as few as three drinks of beer, wine, or liquor a week--and an

increased risk of breast cancer, an increase of as much as 50 percent. These

papers were accompanied by an editorial by Saxon Graham, an epidemiologist at

the State University of New York at Buffalo. Graham recommended that women at

high risk of breast cancer "curtail their alcohol ingestion." Such women, he

said, include those who have a family history of the disease, who are obese,

who were older than twenty-five when they had their first child, or who have

few or no children. <p>



<p>



This, clearly, is no small group, and it would seem that millions of women are

risking decades of life for the sake of an occasional quick one. Such is not,

however, the case. Understanding why requires a grounding in statistics.<p>



<p>



Breast cancer is an extremely common disease. One in eleven women, or about

nine percent of all women, will get it at some point. It seems logical to infer

from this fact, in combination with the studies' estimates of increased risk,

that drinking half a bottle of wine a week increases one's risk of breast

cancer from nine to nearly 14 percent--a sobering prospect. Several reports

made just this inference, but it is incorrect. As the Harvard Medical School

Health Letter pointed out in a follow-up of the Schatzkin and Willett studies,

published last July, the figure of nine percent includes all women, while the

estimates of a 50 percent increased risk given by both studies are based on a

comparison between drinkers and non-drinkers. Also, the studies suggest that

the women whose risk of breast cancer is most increased by drinking are women

otherwise at low risk for the disease--young women of normal weight with no

family history of breast cancer. Very few people in this category get breast

cancer, so it is easy for any variable to appear to the lay person to modify

greatly their risk. A statistician's evaluation of the data, undertaken at the

request of the Harvard newsletter, concludes that if these studies accurately

reflect incidence in the population as a whole, moderate drinking is

responsible for only one or two percent of all breast-cancer cases.<p>



<p>



Does this mean that one to two percent of all women who get breast cancer bring

it upon themselves by enjoying an occasional beer? Not necessarily. There are

factors that confound even this relatively modest conclusion--factors that have

to do with the way the researchers chose to frame their studies. For example,

neither study took the subjects' early diet into consideration. What a woman

ate as a child and teenager is suspected of having a significant effect on her

risk of breast cancer. But since the diet-cancer connection has not been

proved, and since it is almost impossible to get information on early diet (how

many fifty-year-olds remember in detail what they ate as teenagers?), early

diet was not taken into consideration in either the Willett or the Schatzkin

study.<p>



<p>



Nor was exercise considered. Research done at the Harvard School of Public

Health and the State University of New York at Buffalo suggests that exercise,

especially during childhood and adolescence, decreases the risk of breast

cancer. But, again, this research is not conclusive, so exercise was not

included as a variable in either study.<p>



<p>



This does not mean that the studies are incorrect or misleading. In fact, there

have been at least a dozen other reports linking breast cancer with alcohol

consumption. One recent study was published in the April issue of the Journal

of the National Cancer Institute. Elizabeth Harvey, an epidemiologist who was

also a co-author on the Schatzkin study, concluded in the NCI Journal report

that<p>



drinking even moderate amounts of beer, wine, or liquor was, indeed, associated

with increased breast-cancer risk, but only for women who began drinking when

they were under thirty years old. What women drank after they hit thirty seems

to have had no significant effect on their risk. Harvey told me that this paper

received little publicity, and it was not acknowledged in the New England

Journal of Medicine editorial. But what concerns her is that all the press and

television reports have called for a change in women's drinking habits because

of the other studies. She considers particularly misleading the comments of a

network-television medical reporter, who suggested that viewers already at high

risk of breast cancer should abstain entirely. However, such comments are

certainly understandable in light of Saxon Graham's NEJM editorial. Graham

recommended that women at high risk cut back on their drinking not because the

science necessarily dictated it but because he believed it to be prudent.

Journalists simply took his recommendations one step further.<p>



<p>



The NEJM published the Schatzkin and Willett studies back to back, along with

the Graham editorial, because the journal's editors realized that they were

provocative, not only to the informed academic community but also to the

public. Health and medical reporters commonly subscribe to The New England

Journal of Medicine--it is the most comprehensive, easily understood, and

highly publicized journal in its field--and so the Schatzkin and Willett papers

received much more attention than they would have if they had appeared in some

more obscure or specialized publication. It is clear that the authors wanted as

broad an audience as possible--an audience that would include journalists and

other lay people.<p>



<p>



The alcohol-and-breast-cancer studies are valid and important pieces of work,

but, as the authors insisted, they are preliminary. No one can assume a

cause-and-effect relationship between drinking moderate amounts of alcohol and

contracting breast cancer. It is quite possible that something that goes along

with drinking, such as eating cocktail snacks or sitting on bar stools, is what

increases the risk of cancer. It could also be that women who drink, on

average, exercise less or eat more fat or consume fewer vitamins than women who

do not drink. Drinking might thus be a mere artifact, the fall guy for some

other, as yet unknown culprit.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>E</font>PIDEMIOLOGIC studies are particularly vulnerable to premature interpretation

by both the press and scientists eager to stimulate public interest. They are

naturally intriguing. But they cannot, by definition, provide proof of the

cause of a problem. The associations they uncover can seem overwhelming, and

when enough studies over a long period have pointed to the same conclusion,

scientists will agree to accept an agent or combination of agents as the

"cause" of a disease. The majority of smokers, for example, do not get lung

cancer, and scientists cannot say with absolute certainty that some other,

predisposing factor is not involved. Still, the association between lung cancer

and smoking is so strong--smokers have a risk of developing lung cancer ten to

twenty times greater than that of nonsmokers--that smoking is generally

accepted to be an important cause of lung cancer. Tobacco interests continue to

dispute this assumption. The statistical link between breast cancer and

moderate alcohol consumption is by comparison extremely weak: light drinking

appears not even to double a woman's risk of getting cancer. Such a weak

association does not allow conclusions to be drawn. It merely suggests a

relationship that deserves further exploration.<p>



<p>



Epidemiologic studies are prone to misinterpretations for other reasons, too.

For example, it is almost impossible to get a truly random sample of the

population to study, and the choice of study participants can markedly bias

results. A rather extreme example of this is a study done several years ago

that showed an association between pancreatic cancer and coffee consumption. It

was a retroactive study, in which patients hospitalized for the treatment of

pancreatic cancer were compared with a control group of patients, over 30

percent of whom were hospitalized for other digestive disorders. The authors of

the study found that the cancer patients drank significantly more coffee than

the other patients, which caused them to suspect a link between coffee drinking

and cancer. Their methods were later challenged by other experts, who pointed

out that patients with digestive disorders are likely to restrict their coffee

intake. Clearly, the control group selected by the research team was entirely

inappropriate. Some subsequent studies have suggested a more tentative

association between coffee and pancreatic cancer, but the public still links

the two strongly because of the highly publicized study.<p>



<p>



Another problem is that epidemiologic research is often heavily dependent on

subjects' reports of their own behavior. Memory is notoriously selective, and

tends to screen out what it would prefer had never happened. For example, the

continuing confusion over whether obese people truly eat more than people of

normal weight is due in part to the fact that it is nearly impossible to get

good dietary histories from anyone, let alone from the obese. Thus scientific

reports suggesting that obese people eat no more than people of normal weight

share shelf space with reports claiming quite the opposite.<p>



<p>



The inherent limitations of the epidemiologic approach do not render it

invalid. But like most scientific research, population studies provide

information that is meaningless when considered in isolation. There are very

few, if any, genuine "breakthroughs" in science or medicine. Yet too often

researchers are pressed into implying, and journalists into reporting, that

breakthroughs have been made--as one researcher told me, scientists, like

everyone else, are driven by ego. But as a rule it is the gradual accumulation

of evidence that leads to scientific understanding. It is up to the public to

stop expecting miracles and to maintain an open but critical mind.<p>

HOMFELD graduated from the University of California at SantaBarbara and took his master's degree and his doctorate in education atStanford. He has taught in grade school and in college, has served as principalof a junior high school, and since 1947 has been superintendent of Menlo Parkcity school district.</i></font><p>			<pre>		</pre>		<font size=5>T</font>here are signs today that the school has become society's dumping ground, thatthe public school system has become a vast refuse heap for any and everyunwanted service or task that other social or governmental institutions andagencies find too tough to handle. The community, the home, and to some extenteven the church have used the public schools to relieve their consciences offeelings of guilt by passing on unfinished business which they have founddifficult of accomplishment or just burdensome.<p><p>Can we expect to go on and on in this ever-expanding program, one in whichpublic educators attempt to do all things for all people and do them well? Canwe do everything for everybody? If not, by what criterion shall we select thosethings which we can do, and how shall we say no?<p><p>The first half of the twentieth century has seen an almost completemetamorphosis of the institution which we call the public school. The grammarschool of 1900, which has now become the elementary school, offered as itscurriculum reading, writing, spelling, grammar, and numbers, and a few veryadventurous souls were teaching some history and geography. The typical highschool curriculum consisted of more mathematics, history, a concentrated studyof the English language and its literature, and, of course, Latin. Some of themore daring secondary schools were permitting the teaching of German andFrench, but such frills were generally reserved for girls' finishing schools orfor university study in preparation for advanced research. <p><p>Now, to be sure, I have no intention of recommending that we go back to 1900. Iam not damning any of the changes that have taken place during the last fiftyyears. I do say that it is time for us to take stock. It is time to look atwhat we have done to our schools.<p><p>Law enforcement agencies, highway engineers, automobile designers andmanufacturers, and traffic experts have created or permitted to be created aseemingly insoluble problem of mass murder and mayhem on our highways. Whensociety wanted to find a solution, it turned to the public schools and said,"Here, how about teaching us to drive safely? We haven't been able to teachourselves." And so driver education is a standard course of study for ouryoungsters.<p><p>When the good people in our society found themselves faced with an ever-risingdivorce rate and increasing percentages of illegitimate births, and unable todo much about it, they turned to the public schools and said, "Please won't youteach our children family responsibility, how to become good parents, knowledgeof sex and reproduction, how to select a mate, and how to act on a date?" andso more frill courses were added to the curriculum.<p><p>I am reminded of an incident related to me by Mrs. Homfeld concerning aninterruption of an afternoon ladies' bridge party at the home of one of ourneighbors. The front door of the living room opened with a swish and closedwith a bang, and there stood the pride and joy of the household--a teen-agedaughter. Her hair flying, her cashmere sweater pulled askew, her skirt turnedhalfway round on her hips, and a wad of gum keeping her jaws noisily working,our heroine looked neither right nor left, but strode diagonally past half adozen tables of bridge players to the grand piano, where she reached into ahuge cluster of hors d'oeuvres, gathered together as many of the tidbits as shecould, and then marched out of the room through a door at the other corner. Thehostess giggled nervously and remarked, "And that is the kind of manners theyteach our kids in high school."<p><p>When employers of young people found the apprentice system and in-servicetraining of workers to be a difficult and expensive task, they turned to theschools and said, "Here, you can easily equip yourselves to teach carpentry, ordrafting, or plumbing, or sheet-metal work, or electricity, or typing, orbookkeeping, or any one of a hundred other things. You do it."<p><p>When the young American housewife decided to live beyond her husband's means,when Mama went to work and Grandma rebelled at the idea of taking over fullresponsibility for the children, the young couple brought pressure on our statelegislators to establish child care centers, and again the public school wasselected as the agency to carry out the job.<p><p>A task even more difficult than any of these is being slowly pushed on theschool: correcting emotional and social shortcomings of children. Many schoolstoday are including on their staffs dental hygienists who in fact aretherapists, social welfare workers who are in fact social therapists,psychologists and psychiatrists who are in fact mental therapists, and evenmedical doctors to help not in the physical education of children but in thetherapy which might lead to the correction of physical deficiencies.<p><p>And surely school people are not without blame. We of the profession ofeducation have had a strong tendency to welcome with open arms any and everynew task offered us. But I believe a time of reckoning is at hand. Not onlymust we soon come forward with an answer to the question, "What shall weteach?" but I believe we must also consider seriously the query, "Can we teacheveryone?"<p><p>I cite the instance of the tragic death of a junior high school principal inNew York last autumn. In frustration over his inability to curb the misbehaviorof a small minority of his student body, he ended it all by throwing himselffrom the roof of his own school building. I raise the question, "Was hisproblem one of public education, or was it rather one of society at large?"Where is that small minority of children now? Within a few hours following hisdeath, they were permanently expelled along with some six hundred otherincorrigibles from the schools of New York, not because they could not learnbut because they were not physically and emotionally willing to conform tominimum standards. For years the teachers and administrators of New Yorkschools had struggled with this incorrigible minority on the basis that if theykicked them out, there was no place for them to go. The question I raise is,"Is it the school's responsibility, or is it the responsibility of society atlarge?"<p><p>Of a less dramatic but equally serious nature is the problem of the childrenwho are so emotionally disturbed that they become a burden on the teacher andon the other children in their classes. Over and over I have seen teachers andprincipals resist the removal of such children from class on no more soundgrounds than that "the child is better off in school than at home or runningthe streets." Or take the case of the child of irresponsible parents who issent to school improperly fed or rested or clothed, or just plain dirty. Thetendency of teachers is to struggle somehow with the problem--find food or findclothes or provide an opportunity for rest, or all three.<p><p>Can the role of public education include the responsibility for the physical,social, emotional, and spiritual as well as academic instruction of children,or might some of these be handled better by other institutions? Should itinclude the preparation of children for marriage and parenthood, or might otherinstitutions or persons do this job as well or better? Should the schools takethe responsibility for children's activities from dawn to dusk in order to curbjuvenile delinquency, or might we better look to other agencies to acceptresponsibility for part of this day? Should we say yes to every pressure groupthat wants to add one more frill course to our curriculum, or should we say,"No, our job is thus and so. Some other agency must be made responsible forthat."<p><p>The state of California requires its elementary schools to teach nineteensubjects. They include the nature of tobacco, the nature of alcohol, trainingfor healthful living, morals, manners, safety, fire prevention, physicaleducation, conservation of natural resources, art, music, history ofCalifornia, civics, the commemoration of Bird Day, Arbor Day, Luther BurbankDay, and Susan B. Anthony Day. Most local boards of education also requireelementary schools to teach craft courses, instrumental music, woodworking,sewing, cooking, and a variety of other subjects. Each schoolhouse and plantmust also be maintained and operated as a community center for recreation andcivic activities for both young and old. And then, of course, we have to teachreading, writing, arithmetic, spelling, geography, history, and language aswell. <p><p>Most high schools are required either by law or by the pressure of thecommunities in which they operate to offer one hundred or more subjects, andmost of these subjects must be offered on two or three levels of difficulty.<p><p>Changes are coming in the schools. There can be no doubt of this. I can namesome of them for you. We are going to group children more and more forinstruction. Curriculums are going to include more academic subject matter. Theschool year is going to be longer. We are going to eliminate some things fromthe curriculum, and federal aid to education will doubtless become a pattern.<p><p>We here in our own little school district have tended to resist the inroads ofwhat I choose to call "doubtful school tasks." Essentially our schools areacademic in nature. We do not pretend to cure anyone's ills or correct theirphysical, mental, or emotional deficiencies. We do not offer therapy of anykind. We try not to take on the responsibilities that should be met by parents,churches, or other professions and institutions.<p><p>Believe me, I am not sure that we are right. If I were to poll the adultpopulation of my school district to get the reaction to the question, "What doyou think of the oversized, overpowered, high styled, chrome-plated, 1959products of the automotive industry?" there is no doubt that I would get anoverwhelming response favoring less flashy, more conservative, less expensivecars. And yet 75 per cent or more of the people buy the biggest, most powerful,most glittering automobile. Is their evaluation of education in the same vein?Do they give lip service to one kind of education but really want another?<p><p>Let's all look at our school system and identify for ourselves, for ouradministrators, for our board of education, and for the community the spotswhere we duplicate services which are or should be offered by other agencies.Let's stop duplicating services. The schools should set goals that areattainable and should not overcommit their ability to serve. Let them refuse toaccept responsibilities which are beyond their capabilities and refuse toundertake so many duties that none is thoroughly performed.	</blockquote><hr><pre></pre><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a><a href="http://vws.agtnet.com/atl_find.html"><img src="../../../images/bt-find.gif" width=61 height=23 border=0 alt="Search"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1959 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

<blockquote>

<font size=5>I</font> have tried to make an <i>Inferno</i> in English that

stays true to the nature of English, and that conveys the meaning of the Italian as accurately as

possible, in lines of <i>terza rima</i> that will suggest some of the force and

suppleness of Dante's form. Above all, I have tried to translate a poem: in

passages where my English is not literal, I hope that it is faithful to the

spirit.<p>



	Dante invented <i>terza rima</i> (the interlocking rhyme pattern <i>aba</i>,

<i>bcb</i>, <i>cdc</i>, etc.) for the <i>Commedia</i>, and its

effect--combining onward movement with a feeling of conclusiveness in each

step--seems integral to the poem, something well worth trying to approximate.<p>



	It may be helpful to say a few words about rhyme:<p>



	Italian is rich in rhyme, while English--despite having a far greater number

of words--is relatively poor in rhyme. Therefore, the triple rhymes of the

original can put tremendous strain on an English translation. One response to

this strain, one way of dealing with the torturous demands of <i>terza rima</i>

in English, has been to force the large English lexicon to supply rhymes:

squeezing unlikely synonyms to the ends of lines, and bending idiom ruthlessly

to get them there.<p>



	This translation rejects that solution and instead makes a more flexible

definition of rhyme, or of the kind and degree of like sound that constitute

rhyme.<p>



	But on the other hand, I have not accepted just any similar sounds as rhyming:

the translation is based on a fairly systematic rhyming norm that defines rhyme

as the same consonant-sounds--however much vowels may differ--at the ends of

words. For example, the opening tercets of Canto I include the triads

"tell/feel/well," "sleep/stop/up," and "night/thought/it."<p>



	This system of like sounds happens to correspond to some preferences of my own

ear, a personal taste: for me such rhymes as, say, "swans/stones" or

"gibe/club" or "south/both" often sound more beautiful and interesting than

such hard-rhyme combinations as "bones/stones," "rub/club," or "south/mouth."

This idea of harmony seems even more clear with disyllabic or "feminine"

endings: "faces/houses" is more appealing than "faces/places"; "flavor/quiver"

has more interest than "flavor/savor" or "giver/quiver."<p>



	The reader who recognizes these examples I have taken from poems by Yeats, who

is a master of such consonantal rhyming, might speculate that such sounds are

<i>similar for English</i>: roughly as "like," perhaps, in the context of

English and its great sprawling matrix of sounds, as are "<i>terra/guerra</i>"

or "<i>belle/stelle</i>" in the tighter Italian fabric.<p>



	But such speculation aside, and regardless of my own predilections,

consonantal or "Yeatsian" rhyme can supply an audible scaffold of English

<i>terza rima</i>, a scaffold that does not distort the English sentence, or

draw excessively on the reaches of the English lexicon. In this scaffolding,

mere vowel rhymes--even as close as "claim/feign" or "state/raid"--have been

arbitrarily excluded, as taking away some of the backbone or stringency of

effect. The goal is to make enough of a formal demand to support the English

sentence, but not so monstrous a demand as to buckle it, or to mangle the

particularly delicate gestures English syntax and idiom make as they accomplish

work another language might perform with inflected endings.<p>



	(It remains to add that by extension words which end in vowels can be rhymed

by a consistent system in which round vowels rhyme with one

another--"now/throw," or "clue/saw"; as can closed vowels--"be/why" or

"stay/cloy"; and, that disyllabic rhyme so sticks out in English that it can

acceptably be made a step more approximate, as in

"bitter/enter/blunder"--perhaps it <i>must</i> be made more approximate, in

order to avoid the comic feeling of limerick, or of W. S. Gilbert.) <p>



	This is a brief outline of the general principles behind a work which in

practice, as the reader will see, does not apply them without occasional

compromises and slidings. As to hard rhymes, there are many, but as I worked I

often found myself revising them out, or striving to make them the first and

third members of a triad, rather than adjacent, to keep them from leaping out

of a pattern I have labored to make expressive in its variations.<p>



<p>



Though we call it a form, verse is physical, and in this sense the sounds of a

poem are its body. By devising <i>terza rima</i> as the body for a poem about

the fates of souls and bodies, Dante added an expressive element as well as a

kind of movement. His variations in tone and idiom--from direct to elaborately

rhetorical, for example, or from high to low--have an emotional truth that

moves in counterpoint with the current of interlocking rhymes.<p>



	In Canto XII, when Virgil and Dante come down a rocky slope and approach the

chief centaur Chiron, wise teacher of heroes, Chiron makes an interesting

observation to his followers:<p>



<p>

<blockquote>



	<i>As we came close,</i><br>



	<i>Chiron drew an arrow's notch back through the tangle</i><br>

<p>



 



	<i>Of beard along his jaw to clear a space</i><br>



	<i>For his large mouth, and to the others he said:</i><br>



	<i>"Have you observed how that one's steps displace</i><br>



<p>



	<i>Objects his body touches? Feet of the dead</i><br>



	<i>Are not accustomed to behave like that."</i><br>



<p>

</blockquote>



Dante displaces the physical stones of the infernal world, though shades like

Virgil who dwell there do not. And yet, in an apparent contradiction, Virgil

sometimes carries the body of Dante about, as in Canto XXIII:<p>



<p>



<blockquote>



<i>My leader took me up at once, and did</i><br>



<i>   As would a mother awakened by a noise</i><br>



<i>   Who sees the flames around her, and takes her child,</i><br>



<p>



<i>Concerned for him more than herself, and flies</i><br>



<i>   Not staying even to put on a shift:</i><br>



<i>   Supine he gave himself to the rocky place</i><br>



<p>



<i>Where the hard bank slopes downward to the cleft,</i><br>



<i>   Forming one side of the adjacent pouch.</i><br>



<i>   No water coursing a sluice was ever as swift</i><br>



<p>



<i>To turn a landmill's wheel on its approach</i><br>



<i>   Toward the vanes, as my master when he passed</i><br>



<i>   On down that bank that slanted to the ditch,</i><br>



<p>



<i>Hurtling along with me upon his breast</i><br>



<i>   Not like his mere companion, but like his child.</i><br>



</blockquote>



<p>



I suggest that this is not simply an inconsistency, but another indication that

the relation between the two poets, living and dead, Christian and pagan, one

of them still embarked on his venture, the other having completed his, is a

relation between worlds: a point of intersection within a dense web of moral

and physical realities.<p>



	Embodiment, in some such sense, is the <i>Inferno</i>'s action, and its

meaning, and its method. The prosodic embodiment Dante invented for his poem is

characterized by tremendous forward movement, a movement that, in English, the

prose translations have sometimes rendered more effectively than those in

verse. To catch some of that quality, at once propulsive and epigrammatic, I

have allowed myself the liberty of enjambment, at times letting the sentence

run over the rhymed line ending more aggressively than in the original, and

also crossing freely from tercet to tercet. This translation is not

line-for-line, nor tercet-for-tercet. In order to represent Dante's succinct,

compressed quality along with the flow of <i>terza rima</i>, I have often found

it necessary to write fewer lines in English than he uses in Italian. The

Italian line and sentence not being the same as the English line and sentence,

I have hoped to imitate some of Dante's formal energy, in the body of an

English equivalent. This equivalent form, rising from the flow and arrest of

enjambed English sentences, seemed to require stanza breaks between the tercets

of the translation--partly because the white space is a visual register of the

consonantal <i>terza rima</i>.<p>



	To the image of Virgil skidding downhill on his back, while clasping Dante to

his chest, Dante adds the simile of water coursing through a sluice to turn the

regularly spaced vanes of a millwheel. This simile can serve as an image of the

relation of lines and stanzas, like regular vanes, to the surging fluid of the

sentence. At the same time, the motion of the embracing poets represents a

related dynamism of spirit, word, and matter. This translation's arrangement of

rhyme, sentence, line, and stanza attempts hopefully, sometimes perhaps

desperately, to find a commensurate relation of elements--improvised and

imperfect at every point but pushing on: trying to turn the wheel surely enough

to accomplish what work it can.<p>

<blockquote>



Midway on our life's journey, I found myself<br>

   In dark woods, the right road lost. To tell<br>

   About those woods is hard--so tangled and rough<br>

<p>

And savage that thinking of it now, I feel<br>

   The old fear stirring: death is hardly more bitter.<br>

   And yet, to treat the good I found there as well<br>

   <p>



I'll tell what I saw, though how I came to enter<br>

   I cannot well say, being so full of sleep<br>

   Whatever moment it was I began to blunder<br>

<p>

Off the true path. But when I came to stop<br>

   Below a hill that marked one end of the valley<br>

   That had pierced my heart with terror, I looked up<br>

<p>

Toward the crest and saw its shoulders already<br>

   Mantled in rays of that bright planet that shows<br>

   The road to everyone, whatever our journey.<br>

<p>

Then I could feel the terror begin to ease<br>

   That churned in my heart's lake all through the night.<br>

   As one still panting, ashore from dangerous seas,<br>

<p>

Looks back at the deep he has escaped, my thought<br>

   Returned, still fleeing, to regard that grim defile<br>

   That never left any alive who stayed in it.<br>

<p>

After I had rested my weary body awhile<br>

   I started again across the wilderness,<br>

   My left foot always lower on the hill,<br>

<p>

And suddenly--a leopard, near the place<br>

   The way grew steep: lithe, spotted, quick of foot.<br>

   Blocking the path, she stayed before my face<br>

<p>

And more than once she made me turn about<br>

   To go back down. It was early morning still,<br>

   The fair sun rising with the stars attending it<br>

<p>

As when Divine Love set those beautiful<br>

   Lights into motion at creation's dawn,<br>

   And the time of day and season combined to fill<br>

<p>

My heart with hope of that beast with festive skin--<br>

   But not so much that the next sight wasn't fearful:<br>

   A lion came at me, his head high as he ran,<br>

<p>

Roaring with hunger so the air appeared to tremble.<br>

   Then, a grim she-wolf--whose leanness seemed to compress<br>

   All the world's cravings, that had made miserable<br>

<p>

Such multitudes; she put such heaviness<br>

   Into my spirit, I lost hope of the crest.<br>

   Like someone eager to win, who tested by loss<br>

<p>

Surrenders to gloom and weeps, so did that beast<br>

   Make me feel, as harrying toward me at a lope<br>

   She forced me back toward where the sun is lost.<br>

<p>

While I was ruining myself back down to the deep,<br>

   Someone appeared--one who seemed nearly to fade<br>

   As though from long silence. I cried to his human shape<br>

<p>

In that great wasteland: "Living man or shade,<br>

   Have pity and help me, whichever you may be!"<br>

   "No living man, though once I was," he replied.<br>

<p>

"My parents both were Mantuans from Lombardy,<br>

   And I was born <i>sub Julio</i>, the latter end.<br>

   I lived in good Augustus's Rome, in the day<br>

<p>

Of the false gods who lied. A poet, I hymned<br>

   Anchises' noble son, who came from Troy<br>

   When superb Ilium in its pride was burned.<br>

<p>

But you--why go back down to such misery?<br>

   Why not ascend the delightful mountain, source<br>

   And principle that causes every joy?"<br>

<p>

"Then are you Virgil? Are you the font that pours<br>

   So overwhelming a river of human speech?"<br>

   I answered, shamefaced. "The glory and light are yours,<br>

<p>

That poets follow--may the love that made me search<br>

   Your book in patient study avail me, Master!<br>

   You are my guide and author, whose verses teach<br>

<p>

The graceful style whose model has done me honor.<br>

   See this beast driving me backward--help me resist,<br>

   For she makes all my veins and pulses shudder." . . . <br>

<blockquote>



<p>

   [Virgil:] ". . . I will be your guide<br>

   Away from here and through an eternal place:<br>

<p>

To hear the cries of despair, and to behold<br>

   Ancient tormented spirits as they lament<br>

   In chorus the second death they must abide.<br>

<p>

Then you shall see those souls who are content<br>

   To dwell in fire because they hope some day<br>

   To join the blessed: toward whom, if your ascent<br>

<p>

Continues, your guide will be one worthier than I--<br>

   When I must leave you, you will be with her.<br>

   For the Emperor who governs from on high<br>

<p>

Wills I not enter His city, where none may appear<br>

   Who lived like me in rebellion to His law.<br>

   His empire is everything and everywhere,<br>

<p>

But that is His kingdom, His city, His seat of awe.<br>

   Happy is the soul He chooses for that place!"<br>

   I: "Poet, please--by the God you did not know--<br>

<p>

Help me escape this evil that I face,<br>

   And worse. Lead me to witness what you have said,<br>

   Saint Peter's gate, and the multitude of woes--"<br>

<p>

Then he set out, and I followed where he led.<br><p>

   And now I can hear the notes of agony<br>

<p>

In sad crescendo beginning to reach my ear;<br>

   Now I am where the noise of lamentation<br>

   Comes at me in blasts of sorrow. I am where<br>

<p>

All light is mute, with a bellowing like the ocean<br>

   Turbulent in a storm of warring winds,<br>

   The hurricane of Hell in perpetual motion<br>

<p>

Sweeping the ravaged spirits as it rends,<br>

   Twists, and torments them. Driven as if to land,<br>

   They reach the ruin: groaning, tears, laments,<br>

<p>

And cursing of the power of Heaven. I learned<br>

   They suffer here who sinned in carnal things--<br>

   Their reason mastered by desire, suborned.<br>

<p>

As winter starlings riding on their wings<br>

   Form crowded flocks, so spirits dip and veer<br>

   Foundering in the wind's rough buffetings,<br>

<p>

Upward or downward, driven here and there<br>

   With never ease from pain nor hope of rest.<br>

   As chanting cranes will form a line in air,<br>

<p>

So I saw souls come uttering cries--wind-tossed,<br>

   And lofted by the storm.<br>

<blockquote>



"Poet," I told him, "I would willingly<br>

	Speak with those two who move along together,<br>

	And seem so light upon the wind." And he:<br>

<p>

"When they drift closer--then entreat them hither,<br>

	In the name of love that leads them: they will respond."<br>

	Soon their course shifted, and the merciless weather<br>

<p>

Battered them toward us. I called against the wind,<br>

	"O wearied souls! If Another does not forbid,<br>

	Come speak with us." As doves whom desire has summoned,<br>

<p>

With raised wings steady against the current, glide<br>

	Guided by will to the sweetness of their nest,<br>

	So leaving the flock where Dido was, the two sped<br>

<p>

Through the malignant air till they had crossed<br>

	To where we stood--so strong was the compulsion<br>

	Of my loving call. They spoke across the blast:<br>

<p>

"O living soul, who with courtesy and compassion<br>

	Voyage through black air visiting us who stained<br>

	The world with blood: if heaven's King bore affection<br>

<p>

For such as we are, suffering in this wind,<br>

	Then we would pray to Him to grant you peace<br>

	For pitying us in this, our evil end.<br>

<p>

Now we will speak and hear as you may please<br>

	To speak and hear, while the wind, for our discourse,<br>

	Is still. My birthplace is a city that lies<br>

<p>

Where the Po finds peace with all its followers.<br>

	Love, which in gentle hearts is quickly born,<br>

	Seized him for my fair body--which, in a fierce<br>

<p>

Manner that still torments my soul, was torn<br>

	Untimely away from me. Love, which absolves<br>

	None who are loved from loving, made my heart burn<br>

<p>

With joy so strong that as you see it cleaves<br>

	Still to him, here. Love gave us both one death.<br>

	Caina awaits the one who took our lives."<br>

<p>

These words were born across from them to us.<br>

	When I had heard those afflicted souls, I lowered<br>

	My head, and held it so till I heard the voice<br>

<p>

Of the poet ask, "What are you thinking?" I answered,<br>

	"Alas--that sweet conceptions and passion so deep<br>

	Should bring them here!" Then, looking up toward<br>

<p>

The lovers: "Francesca, your suffering makes me weep<br>

	For sorrow and pity--but tell me, in the hours<br>

	Of sweetest sighing, how and in what shape<br>

<p>

Or manner did Love first show you those desires<br>

	So hemmed by doubt?" And she to me: "No sadness<br>

	Is greater than in misery to rehearse<br>

<p>

Memories of joy, as your teacher well can witness.<br>

	But if you have so great a craving to measure<br>

	Our love's first root, I'll tell it, with the fitness<br>

<p>

Of one who weeps and tells. One day, for pleasure, <br>

	We read of Lancelot, by love constrained:<br>

	Alone, suspecting nothing, at our leisure.<br>

<p>

Sometimes at what we read our glances joined,<br>

	Looking from the book each to the other's eyes,<br>

	And then the color in our faces drained.<br>

<p>

But one particular moment alone it was<br>

	Defeated us: <i>the longed-for smile</i>, it said,<br>

	<i>Was kissed by that most noble lover</i>: at this,<br>

<p>

This one, who now will never leave my side,<br>

	Kissed my mouth, trembling. A Galeotto, that book!<br>

	And so was he who wrote it; that day we read<br>

<p>

No further." All the while the one shade spoke,<br>

	The other at her side was weeping; my pity<br>

	Overwhelmed me and I felt myself go slack:<br>

<p>

Swooning as in death, I fell like a dying body.<br>

<p>

	<font size=5>"Y</font>E mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let

King Saul came naturally to mind not long ago as I traveled the length and
breadth of Israel's Jezreel Valley, in the shadow of the Gilboa Mountains. I
had known in an abstract sort of way that the  events associated with any
square mile of Israeli soil are sufficient to provide an ample history for a
medium-sized planet, but it's quite another matter actually to be there on the
ground, finding resonance in every country stream and hilltop settlement. <p>

It was in the Jezreel Valley, beneath Mount Gilboa, that King Saul fell upon
his sword rather than risk capture by the Philistines. A few miles from Mount
Gilboa is the Spring of Harod, where, at the Lord's insistence, the judge
Gideon winnowed his army from 32,000 to 300 men before successfully attacking
the Midianites. Visible to the north is Mount Tabor, below whose slopes the
prophet Deborah led the Israelites to victory over the Canaanites. In the
middle distance lies the village of Endor, where before his final battle Saul
consulted a witch (to his deep regret), and the village of Nain, where Jesus
brought a widow's only son back to life. Just off the road is the mound, or
tel, that harbors the remains of Jezreel, the winter capital of King Ahab and
his wife, Jezebel. A half dozen miles to the west, where a strategic pass opens
onto the Jezreel Valley, lies Tel Megiddo, the earliest of whose twenty-five
occupational layers dates back to the Bronze Age. The final battle between the
forces of good and evil is supposed to take place in the shadow of Mount
Megiddo--Har Meggido, that is to say, or Armageddon. The most recent battle in
the area was of less apocalyptic consequence: it occurred during the First
World War, in September of 1918, when Field Marshal Edmund Henry Hynman Allenby
surprised and routed a Turkish army at Megiddo Pass. Elevated to the peerage a
year later, Allenby would thereafter be known as 1st Viscount Allenby of
Megiddo and Felixstowe. <p>

Until just recently I had never visited <A HREF="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/95fact/is.html">Israel</A> or any of the territory it
currently controls, though I had long maintained an interest in biblical
scholarship. The prospect of setting foot in what was referred to at my
Catholic grammar school as the Holy Land has always been appealing. The appeal,
however, had been diminished greatly in recent decades by almost everything
shown about Israel on the evening news. Many other Americans harbor misgivings
about visiting Israel for the same reason. Still, the <i>intifada</i> has
calmed down. Though many highly charged issues remain unresolved, a peace
accord between the Israelis and the Palestinians has at least been signed.
Tourism in Israel this year has been up substantially. So when given a chance
to visit Israel as a guest of the government and pursue an itinerary of my own
devising, I took it. I brought along as a companion my thirteen-year-old son,
Jack. <p>

Israel's size is a military strategist's nightmare and a traveler's dream. The
country is slightly smaller than Massachusetts, and yet offers widely varying
terrain that is reminiscent by turns of southern Arizona and eastern Kansas, of
Palm Springs and Cape Cod. I was interested not only in seeing the religious
sites I had heard about all my life but also in visiting some archaeological
excavations that, I was told, are well on the way to becoming major
attractions. <pre>
</pre>

 <font size=5>O</font>N European maps from the medieval period <A HREF="http://www1.huji.ac.il/jeru/jerusalem.html">Jerusalem</A> was usually depicted as
the center of the known world, and for many in the West the city continues to
occupy that position, at least emotionally. My son and I approached Jerusalem
by car as evening fell; our first glimpse of the Old City came from an overlook
near the King David Hotel during a late-night stroll. Spotlights played softly
on the limestone walls; the moon above was bright, a day or two past full.
Early the next morning, from the Mount of Olives, we found the view of
Jerusalem that has become a spectacular clich&eacute;: the golden Dome of the
Rock in the foreground, the Kidron Valley at our feet. Some clich&eacute;s
should not be avoided. <p>

			<A HREF="./jerusalb.htm"><img src="./jerusals.gif" align=right hspace=10

We had a guide in Israel throughout our trip--an affable and knowledgeable
native of South Africa named Mike Rogoff, whose bona fides include having
written the introduction, the historical survey, and the chapters on Jerusalem,
Jerusalem's environs, and Lower Galilee for the 1995 edition of <i><A HREF="http://bin-1.gnn.com/bus/wview/">Fodor's</A>
Israel</i>. I am a traveler who hates organized tours and values independence,
so the following statement about having a guide in at least the Old City of
Jerusalem may carry some weight: You want one. The important religious sites in
the Old City--the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Al Aqsa
Mosque--are well known to everyone and easily accessible, but a great deal of
Jerusalem is hidden, down a forbidding alley or an unlikely staircase. Now that
I've been there, I can imagine a compelling tour of Jerusalem that would take
place entirely underground. <p>

I had been prepared to concede the power of the religious sites in Jerusalem
even before our arrival. Physically they are more threadbare than I had
imagined, and their connection with any actual events is tenuous, but that
hardly matters. What sets Jerusalem apart is the people there. Henceforward
when I think of Jerusalem it will be in images of flesh and stone, flesh and
stone, with the flesh periodically breaking into hymns. A convention of some
5,000 Pentecostals lent extra pungency to the scene while we were in Jerusalem,
but even among ordinary tourists a demeanor of reverence toward
<i>something</i> was apparent. The long, slow line of people waiting to enter
the tiny chamber that houses the supposed tomb of Jesus, in the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre, was as polyglot and polydermic a crowd as I've ever seen--and
hushed with expectation. Even the tomb's gruff Greek Orthodox gatekeeper,
redolent of incense, wax, and gravy, could not spoil the mood. Inside, a
wizened cleric in a white robe slapped his bare feet on the marble floor when
it was time for each group of six visitors to depart. (Our group included an
Ethiopian couple in native dress, a bloated German man, and a woman from Texas
wearing a baseball cap from an aircraft carrier.) At the Western Wall we
witnessed a moment of incongruous serenity. A military awards ceremony was
taking place in the plaza, and armed Israeli soldiers stood stiffly in rows.
During a brief pause one of the commanders, his Uzi slung on his back, walked
over to the wall and pressed the palms of his hands against it--flesh and
stone--to pray.<p>

The sere, rocky landscape, the narrow and winding streets, the muezzin's call
to prayer--those stock vignettes of the Old City all have a firm basis in
reality. The market in the Arab Quarter is an odd hybrid, part kitschy tourist
zone and part functioning souk. One street is devoted entirely to butchers'
stalls; the carcasses and entrails lie out for inspection, gamily calling to
mind the many biblical references to "fleshpots." In the dry-goods realm few
transactions are straightforward. My son eventually came to relish the
negotiations involved in establishing the price of even the most trivial item.
Perhaps someday he will know how to buy a car. <p>

The one place in Israel that came as a complete surprise was the Galilee
region: nothing had quite prepared me for its evocative appeal. If Jesus is the
most prominent character in the New Testament, the second most prominent is the
Sea of Galilee. Galilee also became the heart of Jewish life in Palestine after
the Romans destroyed the Temple in A.D. 70, and it was among the first areas to
be settled by the Zionists earlier in this century. The sea itself is small, a
freshwater body shaped like a tear seven miles across at its widest, but a
large proportion of Gospel episodes take place on its surface or among the
rolling hills that form its rim: the Sermon on the Mount, the story of the
loaves and fishes, Jesus' walking upon water. The town of Capernaum, which
Jesus made his headquarters and in whose synagogue he taught, lies on the
northern shore. Mary Magdalene came from Magdala, now called Migdal, a town on
the Sea of Galilee's western shore. It occurred to me, as I stood looking over
the water from the hill associated with the Sermon on the Mount, that almost
all the people Jesus knew well had lived within my line of sight. I was struck
by how small an area this was, and how large a thing had come from it. <p>

Not far from Migdal is Kibbutz Nof Ginosar, where a 2,000-year-old fishing
boat, discovered when the Sea of Galilee's waters receded during a drought in
1986, has recently gone on display. The boat is typical of the kind that the
apostles Peter and James and John would have used as they fished the lake. Our
guide, looking at the boat in the porcelain basin where its timbers have been
soaking up a preservative, said, "All it needs is a nameplate reading 'Zebedee
&amp; Sons.'"<pre>
</pre>

<font size=5>T</font>HE whole of Israel is, of course, an archaeological site. My son and I visited
perhaps a dozen specific locations outside Jerusalem, including what some
archaeologists believe to be the world's oldest city, Jericho, whose earliest
visible fortifications were built about 10,000 years ago. At the two most
extraordinary <A HREF="http://www.israel.org/israel-info/display.cgi/ark@950100.ark">archaeological sites</A> we saw, Beth She'an and Zippori, there were
hardly more than a handful of other visitors. That will change when the
ambitions for these places are realized. <p>

The ancient city of Beth She'an, now a town of 15,000, is mentioned in the
Bible as the place where King Saul's headless corpse was hung from the walls
after the battle at Mount Gilboa. Until recently the glory of the old city was
suggested only by a tel, some twenty layers high, which dates back to biblical
times, and by the excavated remains of an amphitheater built during the Roman
era, when Beth She'an was known as Scythopolis. Scythopolis was the chief city
in the ten-city Graeco-Roman league known as the Decapolis. Jesus probably
passed through here as he traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem. Starting in 1985,
under the auspices of the Antiquities Authority and <A HREF="http://www1.huji.ac.il">Hebrew University</A>, acre
upon acre of ground at Beth She'an has been rolled back, revealing the downtown
area of the most important Roman city in Palestine after Caesarea. Seeing the
exposed bathhouse complex, the temples, the colonnaded streets, it is hard to
imagine that only a decade ago this panorama appeared to be nothing but a
grassy plain. Much of Scythopolis is now being restored, but parts are to be
left exactly as they were after an earthquake destroyed the city, in the eighth
century A.D. The sight is powerful: in places tall columns spear the cobbled
streets at an angle, like javelins. <p>

We climbed the tel and took in the ruins, conscious that most of the
destruction below us had occurred in a few short minutes. Archaeology can
provide haunting snapshots, moments of cataclysm preserved in high resolution.
We had seen another example deep underneath the Jewish Quarter of the Old City
in Jerusalem: a mansion that had been destroyed by fire when the Romans crushed
the Jewish revolt in A.D. 70. From the account of Flavius Josephus we know the
exact day the mansion was burned. The atmosphere of family life cruelly
disrupted is impossible to escape: one can actually see that the guest rooms
were in the process of being redecorated. <p>

A second remarkable site is just outside Nazareth, in Zippori--a national park
that takes its name from the Graeco-Roman city of Sepphoris, which is being
excavated by teams from several Israeli and American universities. Decades of
work lie ahead. What makes the city notable is the floor mosaics: the dozen
examples that have been turned up so far include some of the finest ever found
in Israel. After visiting perhaps one mosaic site too many, my son bore the air
of a jaded connoisseur, but even he was startled into appreciation by the
delicate and deftly rendered face of a beautiful woman in the floor of a Roman
villa at Sepphoris. The goal ultimately is to make Zippori into an
archaeological park focused on the mosaics. <p>

Crowning the hill that Sepphoris occupies is a citadel built originally by the
Crusaders on Byzantine foundations and then rebuilt by the Turks. A close look
at the base reveals that many of the building blocks are in fact empty Roman
sarcophagi. The past has never gone unused for long in this part of the world,
which is both its fascination and its problem. <pre>
</pre>

<font size=5>T</font>HE travel literature on Israel, old and new, is abundant and often of high
quality; I made frequent use of the text-heavy Fodor's guidebook, of the
elegantly illustrated <i>Insight Guide: Israel</i>, and of Sarah Kaminker's
oft-reprinted <i>Footloose in Jerusalem</i>, which plots a series of walking
tours. Also, specific queries about many Israel-related subjects can be
answered by the <A HREF="http://www.ibm.net.il/infotour/">Israel Government Tourist Information</A> Center (800-596-1199). To
the information provided by these sources I would add a few observations. <p>

There is the matter of security. It is impossible not to be aware of what
Israelis I have spoken with refer to as "the situation." At the airport, at the
gates to the Old City and the entrances to the Temple Mount, at highway
checkpoints--here and elsewhere you will encounter obvious defensive measures.
The sight of uniformed (and sometimes civilian) Israelis strolling about with
machine guns is common; my son, who kept a count of such people, recorded a
one-day high of ninety-seven. What came as a surprise, though, was that despite
all this, the predominant sensation in the areas I visited is of lives being
led more or less peacefully. (Granted, I had no intention of going to known
trouble spots.)

Even an unruly demonstration that I chanced upon while on my way
to meet someone at a restaurant failed to disturb the underlying atmosphere on
my visit. The demonstration--by Israeli rightists protesting the implementation
of the peace accords --was a significant one, and was met with armored cars and
water cannons; it was the lead story in the <i>Jerusalem Post</i> the next day.
But no more than a block away from the demonstration city life went on as
normal.<p>

Don't be shy about seeking professional help. If on a first trip to Israel you
are not traveling with an organized group, then make arrangements to hire a
guide for all or part of your visit (the cost of a guide with a car runs to
about $300 a day for up to seven people), or to take guided day trips. Ireland,
England, Italy, Canada--these are countries you can simply drop into. In
Israel, with its complex political and religious terrain, it is an advantage to
have someone who can provide continual orientation, at least at the outset.
I'll probably conduct my next trip to Israel on my own, but on this first trip
Mike Rogoff saved us enormous amounts of time and helped us bypass likely
occasions of confusion. Israel is careful when it comes to guides. They have to
be licensed by the government, and to obtain their licenses must have undergone
a two-year training program. <p>

Bring along a Bible--an obvious enough piece of advice, I suppose, but this is
something I nearly failed to do in my haste to depart. My own choice was <i>The
HarperCollins Study Bible</i>, which contains not only the full text of the
Hebrew Bible and the New Testament but also extensive footnotes and historical
commentary. I also brought <i>The Oxford Companion to the Bible</i>. These are
bulky volumes, not suitable for hauling around in a knapsack. I kept them in
the hotel room and at night consulted them with reference to whatever route we
planned to follow the next day. This geography-driven approach to Bible reading
might be frowned on by theological purists, but it is at once a purposeful and
an eclectic way to renew acquaintance with all that wonderful language. <p>

There is no substitute for high-quality maps. The Israeli Government Land
Survey Department produces excellent ones at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:100,000,
with legends that indicate almost every conceivable topographic and
archaeological feature in the country in addition to roads, cities, and towns.
You can buy these maps in Israel at many outlets of the bookstore chain
Steimatzky's, and you can also order them in the United States through a
company called Map Link (805-965-4402). <p>

Finally, try to do a little bit less than you might. Israel's size makes it
possible--and therefore tempting--to pack as many activities into, say, a week
as would require three weeks somewhere else. I haven't even brought up swimming
in the Dead Sea, poring over the Dead Sea Scrolls, exploring the summit of
Masada, touring abandoned Syrian bunkers in the Golan Heights, or standing
under cool waterfalls among the ibexes in the desert-locked and improbably lush
nature reserve at Ein Gedi--all of which, and more, we did. In retrospect I
wish that Jack and I had had a few more empty hours just to walk the streets of
Jerusalem or to sip cold drinks at an outdoor table in the souk or to spend an
evening with friends. <p>

Fortunately, there was one day when we did have time for some of these things.
There is much to be said for the sabbath.

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>"M</font>Y sister moved from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv so that she could sin," a Tel
Avivian, Phyllis Glazer, told me recently. After I had toured Israel's
religious sites, I had asked Glazer, a restaurant critic, to point me toward
some of Jerusalem's worldly pleasures. "Jerusalemites visit each other," she
told me, explaining why for the most part the original city on a hill has only
very casual restaurants rather than places to dine. "It's a beautiful place but
I could never, never live there."<p>

During my stay I was surprised by how many people echoed her views. Jerusalem
is for people who come to live on holy ground; Tel Aviv is for people who want
to live in Theodor Herzl's vision of a cosmopolitan city and take part in the
modern world. If you want to stroll down an Israeli street lined with quirky,
forward-looking shops, or sit back and enjoy a relaxed meal in a restaurant
that cares about elegance and service, Tel Aviv is the place.<p>

It's also the place if you want to lie on the beach. "Rio without the crime" is
how Geoffrey Weill, who has long done <A HREF="http://www.israel.org/israel-info/Sites.html">public relations for Israel</A>, describes
it. His claim is not outlandish. Tel Aviv may have no spectacular mountains
(and no shantytowns either), but it has a clean crescent of beach lined with
high-rise luxury hotels running the length of the city, and a wide boardwalk
paved in the same swirling pattern of gray-and-beige stone as Rio de Janeiro's
Copacabana. Strolling the boardwalk, which seemingly the entire city does at
least once a day, either to look at everyone else or to sneak in an hour on the
sand, is a way to see what both Weill and Glazer mean. <p>

One Friday night, for example--in Israel the height of the weekend--a naked
young man on the beach held aloft his clothed girlfriend, twirling as they
kissed. A live band nearby played Latin dance music while couples, including
many Ethiopian Jews, stood and drank and danced. Farther down the boardwalk
loudspeakers played Lawrence Welk- style tunes while two young couples
performed Astaire-Rogers dance routines, their expressions taut with
concentration on the beat. A young woman hunching on a low stone wall stared at
the water, perhaps contemplating her first, rocky love affair. Old couples
walked hand in hand, and elderly women took late-night promenades alone,
clearly unconcerned about who might be three steps behind.<p>

The boardwalk is crowded with caf&eacute;s, and so are fashionable streets like
Dizengoff and Nahalat Binyamin. I don't think I've ever before seen so many
signs for Illy, Lavazza, and Segafredo espresso outside Italy. The city has
recently discovered ice cream and gelato, and home-grown chains rival the
influx of Ben &amp; Jerry's. I liked Blue Moon the best of the local chains,
and the poppy-seed and date-and-almond ice creams at Shluk, a styleless
ice-cream shop at 68 Dizengoff, best of all.<p>

Tel Aviv's most charming outdoor setting is the old town of Jaffa, whose stone
streets and houses the Israeli government aggressively restored (with mixed
success) in the 1960s as an artists' quarter. Dining at the port, with its
marina of fishing and pleasure boats at a short remove from the urban center,
is reminiscent of dining in Piraeus--and so are the high prices for grilled
fresh-caught fish. I'm not sure, though, that fishermen on the Piraeus dock
wear cellular telephones on their belts.<p>

Taboon is the fish restaurant that came recommended, but on the advice of
friends I went first to Babai, just down the quay. The owner, Itzhak Finegold,
displayed the famous native-born-Israeli arrogance by speaking dismissively of
his competitors, and he forced dish after dish upon my table, all of which
turned up on the bill. The food compensated for the braggadocio. Of the many
dishes Finegold insisted we try, one of fried eggplant slices layered with
diced tomatoes, mild goat cheese, basil, and a creamy pesto sauce was superb.
On another evening in Jaffa, Taboon proved very pleasant, with similarly fresh
fish but few attempts at culinary distinction.<p>

Because Israelis have served the foods of the places they and their families
came from, a separate Israeli cuisine doesn't exist. Several restaurants in Tel
Aviv are cooking their way toward one, though. The most notable is Kapot Tmarim
("Palm Fronds"), which occupies the ground floor of one of the many
Bauhaus-style houses in Lev ("Heart of") Tel Aviv, a fashionable neighborhood.
(If only the city streets were as clean as the beach.) Sheinken Street, in the
same neighborhood, is the city's chief thoroughfare for the kind of offbeat,
design-driven boutiques and caf&eacute;s one used to find in New York's SoHo
before the rents went up. <p>

I was impressed and even moved by the efforts that the young and ambitious
owner of Kapot Tmarim--Offer Gal, a French-trained chef--has made to create a
restaurant of international distinction, commissioning farmers to grow herbs
and raise Muscovy ducks and produce foie gras, and using local fruits in
desserts and between-course herbal sorbets. (I usually dislike these, but the
rosemary sorbet I tried was potent, refreshing, and barely sweetened.) Israel
exports foie gras--to France, even--and the foie gras terrine served with meaty
farm-raised quail was especially good. The attractive young waiters and
waitresses were clearly unfazed by the many linguistic demands presented
nightly; young people behind the counters in a surprising number of the shops
and caf&eacute;s I entered spoke little or no English. Before dessert a
waitress brought a small plate of melon balls and slices of prickly pear, or
sabra--the national fruit, possible source of the name for native-born
Israelis, who are also prickly without and (some of them, anyway) soft
within.<p>

Forel, a similarly spare and modern restaurant near the Sheraton (the Hilton,
where I stayed with great pleasure, and the Sheraton are thought to be the
city's top hotels), also features Israeli products.  Its leanings, though, are
more Italian, which is the mode in Israel as in America. A countertop covered
with oval dishes of antipasto salads greets the visitor, along with the smell
of garlic. The salads, based on fried zucchini and eggplant and roasted
peppers, were fine, especially one with beets and dill. But the fish--the local
sea bass, and the trout that gives the restaurant its name--was the standout.
The bass was perfectly grilled; the farmed trout had more flavor than farmed
fish usually does and was big and meaty. Unexpectedly, the fish bettered that
served by the port restaurants in Jaffa.<p>

Visitors usually want ethnic specialties, and two recommended places in the
decayed Yemenite quarter are Zion, one of the first restaurants in the country
to gain fame, and the more recently opened Maganda. Both serve hummus and
skewered meat and many eggplant salads. I tried Zion, which looks something
like a coffee shop with red flocked wallpaper (there's outdoor seating too) and
serves big portions of wonderful salads and meat at an alarming speed. As soon
as you ask for a basket of grilled pita, which comes in big rounds, or one of
the stuffed vegetables, each containing a different rice, fruit, vegetable, or
meat stuffing, or more of the unctuous, not-garlicky, extremely fresh hummus,
it appears on the wood-grain laminate table. Even the mixed grill that a friend
and I devised--turkey, chicken, lamb, and the inevitable foie gras--seemed to
arrive in an instant. If you can slow the staff down, you can savor a copious
meal that won't cost more than $20.00 a head (fancier restaurants cost $30.00
to $50.00 a head), including either of the two Israeli beers; I preferred the
lighter Maccabi to the sweet, heavy Goldstar.<p>

The meal I liked best was the cheapest and simplest. On my dining expeditions
to Jaffa, I wondered at the constant crowds lining up at a garishly lit bakery
on the town's short main street, just beyond the clock tower, with its
whimsical stained glass. Did so many people want doughnuts and croissants,
which I saw stacked in pyramids at each of the three arched ordering windows,
so late at night? I found out what they were after when I read the excellent
chapter on Tel Aviv in the <A HREF="http://www.lonelyplanet.com.au/lp.htm">Lonely Planet</A> guide to Israel, and begged the friend
driving me to the airport for my late-night departure to stop first in Jaffa.
<p>

The Said Abulafia & Sons bakery, currently run by a fourth generation of
bakers, is a pita paradise. Behind those windows is a constantly active oven
into which go racks of dimpled pita bread, sprinkled with olive oil and
<i>za'atar</i>, a mixture of sumac, sesame, salt, and the lemony wild marjoram
that gives the blend its name. (You can order an excellent version of the
mixture from Greater Galilee Gourmet, at 800-290-1391.) Pita dough is rolled
into straight-sided tart pans to become a kind of deep-dish pizza, filled with
eggs sunny-side up and sometimes mushrooms or olives (plain eggs are the
classic). A sweeter, spongier dough is filled like a calzone with chunks of
creamy, not-too-salty Bulgarian feta and sprinkled with sesame seeds; it
emerges golden and puffy, the cheese just warm. Big, airy rings of
sesame-coated <i>beigele </i>(bagels)--insipid in the hands of most Israeli
bakers, it must be said--are split, filled with feta and olives, and heated to
become ethereal sandwiches.<p>

The only hitch is that the bakery doesn't have tables. My friend and I went to
a modest and brightly lit outdoor restaurant toward the port, where I had
earlier seen a handlettered sign, NOUS AVONS DU FOIE GRAS, and asked if we
could have some beer and spread our freshly baked dinner on the paper
tablecloths. The answer was yes. The farewell supper made me wonder how soon I
could return.

	<i><font size=4>An eerily familiar house rises in many American landscapes
	</i></font>	<p>										

</center>

			<!--TEXT-->

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>T</font>HIRTY miles north of Manhattan, hard by the old brickmaking village of
Haverstraw, New York, stands a <A HREF="http://ucowww.ucsc.edu/~erics/art/hopper_building.html">mansard-roofed house</A> that occupies a peculiar
place in our collective store of images. The first time I passed the house, it
stopped me dead: it was as familiar and disquieting as a recurring dream.<p>

The house was built in 1885, near the crest of a hill that rises steeply from
the west bank of the Hudson River. By the turn of the century it had been
abandoned; neighborhood children called it haunted. During the First World War
the house was used as an open shelter by vagrants, who slept on mounds of hay
in the kitchen. In 1919 it was bought by the district attorney of Rockland
County, Thomas Gagan. His eldest daughter, Amo, one of six children, occupied a
room on the second floor, facing the river, and lived in the house for
forty-one years. Recently she told me that in 1925, when she was thirteen, she
looked out her bedroom window and saw a man sitting across the road, painting.
The man was Edward Hopper; the small canvas on his portable easel became
<i>House by the Railroad </i>, a dominant work of twentieth-century American
art.<p>

That canvas, acquired in 1930 by the fledgling Museum of Modern Art, was the
very first painting in the museum's collection. In the years since, 
<A HREF="http://www.southern.com/wm/paint/auth/hopper/landscapes/railroad/">
<i>House by the Railroad </i></A> has become an icon in the dreamscape of American isolation.
The picture's quality of solitude is due in part to the radical surgery
performed upon the model by the artist, who reinvented the architecture of many
of his subjects. In this case he amputated the entire right side of the
building, leaving the central tower central to nothing, and removed the back
rooms, the surrounding buildings, the trees in front of the house, and the
hillside behind it. The house stands alone but for the tracks, themselves a
sign of abandonment.<p>

</blockquote>

			<img src="./hopper.gif" hspace=10 vspace=10 alt=""><p>
<blockquote>
In 1960 Alfred Hitchcock chose Hopper's version of this house as the 
template for the dwelling of Norman Bates and his mother in <A 
HREF="http://stlife.byu.edu/kiosk/sld/varsity/psycho.html"><i>Psycho </i>.</A> 
Charles Addams drew a similarly sinister mansion for his cartoon family.  
Under a Technicolor Texas sky in George Stevens's <i>Giant </i> (1956) a 
reconstruction of the house is the focus of a triangle formed by James 
Dean, Rock Hudson, and Elizabeth Taylor.  In Terence Malick's <i>Days of 
Heaven </i> (1978) a surreal variant of the house rises from a bleaker 
Texas plain as home to a dying landowner, played by Sam Shepard.  "The 
house shines with finality," the poet Mark Strand has written of Hopper's 
painting.  "It is like a coffin."<p>

Having passed the house often, I walked for the first time through the front
door--obscured in the painting by Hopper's brush--one recent morning. The
once-grand residence has been divided into six apartments, and is home to
twenty people. In the central hall the only furniture was a discarded
refrigerator; the ample arches leading from it had been filled with sheets of
plywood, hollow-core doors fitted within them. The parquet floors were covered
in linoleum, the high plaster ceilings hidden by acoustic tiles. The marble
mantles, Tiffany chandeliers, and etched glass had been removed long ago, but a
mahogany banister still beckoned up the stairs. On the second floor I knocked
on an apartment door. The tenant, a working mother who lives  with her four
children, aged seven through thirteen, invited me in.<p>

For some time I stood at Amo Gagan's old window, gazing at its broad view of the
Hudson. The train tracks are still there, though the little Haverstraw station
has been remodeled as a lawyer's office. Westchester was an abstract stroke of
green between silver water and the light of river clouds. I imagined what young
Miss Gagan saw when she spotted Hopper from this room seventy years ago; I know
where he was sitting.<p>

Behind me the children were watching a raucous confessional talk show. Through
the window came the dull roar of traffic on Route 9-W, just steps from the
front porch. Not far away shimmered the mirage of home promised by bright,
familiar logos. It was as if time had fulfilled Hopper's vision of this house
by the railroad, enfolding it in the cluttered landscape that is at once no
place and everywhere.<p>

		ew things frighten a woman more than discovering a lump in one of 

her breasts. With good reason: <a href="http://www.pslgroup.com/

Breastcancer.htm#Other">breast cancer</a> may transform a woman's 

breast into the vehicle of her death. It is twice as likely to be 

diagnosed in an American woman today as it was sixty years ago. And the 

treatment--surgery, usually followed by radiation and 

chemotherapy--is disfiguring, painful, and all too often unsuccessful. <p>

	I have been researching and treating this disease for more than 

thirty-five years, a period in which the public's awareness of breast 

cancer has risen enormously. The disease has brought into being an entire 

industry of research organizations, charitable agencies, commercial 

ventures, and advocacy groups. Every new statistic is trumpeted in the 

media, and every encouraging research finding, no matter how tenuous, is 

held up as a potential breakthrough. <p>

One result of this visibility has been a rise in public sympathy for 

victims of breast cancer and a concomitant rise in funding for 

breast-cancer research. But the growth in awareness has had another, less 

desirable result: a flood of often contradictory information that has led 

to public confusion. Paradoxically, women are both too anxious about their 

chances of developing breast cancer and too hopeful about our current 

approaches to diagnosing and treating the disease. They believe that 

breast cancer is an epidemic and that it is being cured. Unfortunately, 

both these beliefs arise from flawed reasoning--not by women but by 

the medical profession. <p>

Two groups in the health-care profession are involved in the fight against 

cancer--indeed, against any kind of disease. The first works 

principally on the front lines, helping patients understand the therapies 

available and offering insight, treatment, and reassurance whenever 

possible. The second works mostly at scientific institutions, performing 

the methodical, frustratingly slow tasks associated with epidemiology, 

clinical trials, and laboratory analysis. As researchers, the members of 

the second group are necessarily less concerned with the fate of specific 

patients than with understanding specific diseases and whether medicine is 

successfully combating them. To move forward, they must coldly distinguish 

between genuine advances and wishful thinking. I have spent my career as a 

member of the first group, although Ihave also spent years helping to 

conduct and analyze clinical trials. In what follows Ihave adopted the 

researcher's view of the big picture, while also summarizing the risks and 

benefits of the treatments now available to women with breast 

cancer--treatments the clinician in me still recommends and performs, 

though the researcher wonders how often they will be of meaningful help. 

Only by stepping back from the perspective of caring for individual 

patients can one hope to make clear what doctors mean (or should mean)when 

they use such broad words as "epidemic"and "cure."<p><br>

<CENTER><b>IS BREAST CANCER <br>

AN EPIDEMIC?</b><p>

</CENTER>Many of my patients have conflicting images of their breasts. On 

the one hand, breasts are symbols of beauty, sexuality, and nurturing; on 

the other, they are troublesome organs that are increasingly likely to 

threaten women's lives. In the United States the likelihood that a woman 

will be found to have breast cancer has slowly and inexorably mounted 

since the 1930s, when some systematic data collection began. The increase 

in diagnoses, already a cause for concern, accelerated in the 1980s, 

growing by a rate of four percent a year. This year, according to the <a 

href="http://www.cancer.org/"> 

American Cancer Society</a>, some 184,300 women will discover that they have 

the disease; another 44,300 will die of it. Of the women in whom cancer is 

diagnosed, 9,200 will not yet be forty--nearly twice the number of 

women under forty who were found to have breast cancer in 1970. The 

disease is now the leading cause of death for American women aged forty to 

fifty-five, and causes women to lose more years of productive life than 

any other disease. Numbers like these are why breast cancer is often 

called an epidemic. <p>

To our grandparents, this picture would have seemed amazing. At the turn 

of the century cancer of the breast was a relatively unusual disease. What 

happened? Why does the incidence of breast cancer seem so much higher 

today? <p>

Some of the increase is more apparent than real. Because women today are 

less likely to die young in childbirth or of infectious disease, they live 

long enough to develop diseases of middle and old age, breast cancer among 

them. And the recent jump in the number of breast-cancer victims under 

fifty is almost wholly due to the concurrent jump in the number of women 

in that age group, caused by the Baby Boom. A third reason for the 

increase in diagnoses of breast cancer is the growing use of <a href="

http://vh.radiology.uiowa.edu/Patients/PatientDept/RadiologyBrochures/

Mammography/MamXRay.html"> mammography</a>, 

a technique that uses x-rays to examine the breast. With mammography 

doctors catch many cancer cases earlier than they otherwise would 

have--and some cases that would never have been caught at all. The 

technique surged in popularity in the 1980s, and accounts for much of the 

recent spurt in diagnoses. (Now that mammography is routine, the rate of 

increase in diagnoses has slowed.)<p>

At the same time, most experts in medical statistics believe that these 

factors do not explain <I>all</I> of the rise. Even when greater 

longevity, the population bulge, and the introduction of mammography are 

taken into account, a real, underlying increase remains. Minus those three 

factors, the chance that a woman will be found to have breast cancer has 

been growing steadily for decades, at roughly one percent a year. <p>

What lies behind this rise? Although there is not enough evidence to say 

with certainty, an increasing number of observers have come to believe 

that the emergence of breast cancer as a widespread health problem is tied 

to the extraordinary transformations in women's lives. Coupled with better 

nutrition, the expansion of opportunities for women, especially in the 

industrialized West, altered not only women's lives but also their bodies, 

and especially their cycles of reproductive hormones--apparently 

making them more susceptible to certain cancers. <p>

For most of human history menarche, the age of first menstruation, usually 

occurred in the late teens. (This is one reason that previous generations 

saw less early-teenage pregnancy--fewer adolescents were 

physiologically capable of having babies.) Once fecund, women of past 

millennia quickly became pregnant with the first of perhaps half a dozen 

children, each of whom they breast-fed for an extended period--a 

practice that regularly stops the menstrual cycle. If they survived to 

their mid-thirties, they were aged in appearance and probably 

post-menopausal; their brutal living conditions usually did not permit 

them to live much longer. Late menarche, multiple pregnancies, long 

nursing times, early menopause--all these combined to make women of 

the past menstruate much less often than their modern counterparts. Many 

women in the past may have ovulated only twenty times in their entire 

lives. <p>

This grim picture changed only recently. Not until modern times has a 

large percentage of humankind been able to obtain a continuous supply of 

nutritious food and potable water or been able to control infectious 

disease. The average age of menarche has fallen to twelve in Western 

industrialized nations. Meanwhile, the age of first marriage has risen. 

According to the <a href="http://www.census.gov/"> U.S. Census Bureau</a>, it 

now averages twenty-four for women 

in this country; many educated and affluent women do not marry until their 

thirties, partly because of the increased opportunities to have careers 

outside the home. Pregnancy, too, has become much less common, as lost 

working time drives up the cost of having babies. Marriages produce an 

average of two children, which women nurse briefly if at all. And <a href=

"http://www.pslgroup.com/Menopause.htm">

menopause</a> does not occur until age fifty or later. Women today are thus 

exposed to reproductive hormones over a much longer span than in the past. 

They may have 300 to 400 periods--fifteen to twenty times as many as 

their ancestors had, exposing their breasts to historically unprecedented 

numbers of estrogen-progesterone cycles. <p>

Estrogen and progesterone, like aspirin, have such familiar-sounding names 

that people often don't realize how powerful their effects are. Among 

these effects is the multiplication of cells within the breast. With 

repeated menstrual cycles that are rarely interrupted by full-term 

pregnancy, the number of cells in some parts of the breast can increase by 

a factor of a hundred or even more. If only because of the simple increase 

in number, this constantly repeated cellular multiplication is believed to 

increase the likelihood of genetic accidents. Most cancers are believed to 

arise from such accidents, and so the strong suspicion is that repeated 

menstruation is a precursor to cancer of the breast. <p>

If the improvements in women's lives have indirectly promoted breast 

cancer, then it is unhelpful to call the growth in its incidence an 

epidemic. In medical terms an epidemic is the sudden outbreak of a 

generally rare condition, such as the deadly spread of cholera in a city 

with contaminated water, and should be stopped by striking at its 

source--in this example the contaminated water. The "epidemic" of 

breast cancer, in contrast, may be an unwanted accompaniment to what most 

Americans view as social and material progress. If this suspicion is true, 

it is obviously unacceptable to eliminate the epidemic's cause. <p>

Equally important, the increase in breast cancer does not resemble other 

epidemics. Although the likelihood that a woman will be found to have the 

disease has climbed, the likelihood that it will end her life has not. 

After adjustments for today's longer life-span and the population bulge 

associated with the Baby Boom, the proportion of women who are killed 

every year by breast cancer--24.7 to 27.6 per 100,000 --has 

remained little changed since the 1930s. Women face an ever-increasing 

risk of being discovered to have breast cancer, then--but not of dying 

from it. It is highly unusual, to say the least, for a nationwide epidemic 

of a fatal disease not to affect the death rate.<p>

This odd and even paradoxical situation has sown much confusion and fear. 

Breast cancer is a major public-health concern; it kills 0.04 percent of 

all American women yearly. But it is important for women to recognize that 

other conditions, especially the various forms of cardiovascular disease 

and, for smokers, lung cancer, are much more likely to claim their lives. 

Unfortunately, the enormous publicity accorded the rise in breast-cancer 

incidence has obscured the fact that the disease is not the leading killer 

of women. Also, the publicity usually obscures the fact that the majority 

of women who die of the disease are elderly. In a survey conducted by 

three researchers at the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/dms/cecs/">

Dartmouth Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences</a> and published in

May of last year in the <a href="http://wwwicic.nci.nih.gov/jnci/

jnci_issues.html"><I>Journal of the 

National Cancer Institute</I></a>, the median estimate female Baby Boomers 

gave of their chance of dying of breast cancer within a decade was 10 

percent. A substantial minority thought the risk was 30 percent or more. 

In fact, the likelihood that a woman in her forties will die of breast 

cancer in the next ten years of her life is on the order of 0.4 percent. 

<p>

In my view, the medical profession, too, has lost perspective. If a 

woman's chances of dying of breast cancer are little changed despite a 

huge rise in the incidence of the disease, there are two possible 

explanations. First, we could be making progress. To go on from the 

current hypothesis: as women's changing hormonal environment slowly drove 

up the number of breast-cancer cases, our mastery of the disease could 

have grown at such a rate that, year after year, the increase in cures 

precisely canceled out the increase in incidence, leaving the overall 

death rate unaffected. When my colleagues claim that we are curing breast 

cancer, they are implicitly endorsing this view. And why not? When 

physicians treat more cases of a disease while observing the same number 

of deaths, that means a smaller percentage of their patients are dying.<p>

The second possible explanation is that the change in women's hormonal 

environment is creating a surge in slow-growing, less-aggressive forms of 

breast cancer. Because this "new" breast cancer, if it is indeed 

responsible for the rise in diagnosed cases, is a much less dangerous 

disease than the breast cancer that was found before, in many cases it 

would not need treatment beyond excising the primary tumor. The rise in 

incidence would not be matched by a rise in breast-cancer mortality, 

because women would die first of other causes. The apparent good news 

about the decline in the proportion of fatal cases would in fact be 

masking the unchanged prevalence of the "old" breast cancer: a persistent 

public-health problem that is just as likely to kill women now as it was 

sixty years ago. I believe this is just what we are seeing.<P><br>

<CENTER><b>BREAST-CANCER <br>

BASICS </b><p>

</CENTER>Female breasts are one of the most variable parts of the human 

anatomy. Evolved from sweat glands, they are designed to provide milk for 

infants through a system of ducts and lobules. The ducts are small tubes 

that run several inches back from the nipple to the milk-producing 

lobules, which stick out from the ducts like clusters of tiny grapes. Both 

are enveloped by fat and connective tissue, which are contained within a 

sac of skin shaped roughly like a teardrop. The whole assembly changes 

dramatically in size, shape, and constitution during the menstrual cycle, 

pregnancy, breast-feeding, and menopause. Not only do breasts vary from 

woman to woman but each woman's breasts continue to change throughout her 

life. <p>

At any given time a third to a half of all Western women have some kind of 

breast problem, although most are not particularly concerned about the 

symptoms--nor need they be. The symptoms frequently include swelling 

and aching before menstrual flow; women may feel their breasts engorge and 

grow tender. If their breasts become lumpier, however, this may be owing 

to cysts--fluid-filled balloon-like sacs within the breast. Or the 

lumps may be solid, nodular clumps of overgrown breast-duct cells, known 

generically to doctors as mammary dysplasia or , the most widely used 

term, fibrocystic disease. These conditions are benign--a term doctors 

use to mean "not cancerous." ("Benign" does not mean "not painful" or "not 

harmful." Many benign conditions should be treated.) <p>

If much of the breast is palpably lumpy, as is often the case, the 

diagnosis is usually "benign." Matters are less clear when the problem is 

in a small area: "dominant mass" is the term used by most doctors for a 

swelling that stands out sharply. In such a case a biopsy is almost 

routinely recommended. Sometimes the biopsy involves nothing more than 

extracting a sample from the breast with a needle, but the surgeon may 

also remove the entire lump. Afterward, the tissue is examined in a 

laboratory. Most of the time the news is reassuring; two thirds to four 

fifths of all biopsies reveal that the abnormality is not malignant. 

(Women in their forties are more likely than older women to have negative 

biopsies, because mammograms of their naturally lumpier breasts are harder 

to interpret.)Yet the specter of breast cancer remains--many of these 

"benign" conditions are statistically linked with the disease. <p>

Breast cancer is as diverse as the breast itself, appearing in many 

different guises. Some cancers seem to erupt out of ordinary breast tissue 

with an awesome virulence, spreading rapidly throughout the body. When 

viewed under a microscope, the cells in these cancers almost always bear 

no resemblance to ordinary duct or lobule cells--they have lost all 

the specialized characteristics that differentiate cells in the breast 

from cells in other parts of the body. "Poorly differentiated" 

malignancies, as pathologists refer to them, are usually bad news, no 

matter what we bring to bear therapeutically.  <p>

Fortunately, these poorly differentiated, clinically virulent cancers are 

relatively uncommon. Much more often--perhaps in half of all 

breast-cancer cases--pathologists see malignancies that still bear 

some of the characteristics of normal breast tissue. These "moderately 

differentiated" tumors have a wide range of outcomes, though the prognosis 

for the patient is generally more favorable. A substantial number of women 

with moderately differentiated tumors will survive for years after 

treatment--even decades. In most cases these tumors evolve more slowly 

than their poorly differentiated cousins, probably taking years to become 

detectable. "Well-differentiated" tumors, a less common form, are more 

indolent still. Indeed, pathologists sometimes have trouble ascertaining 

whether they are truly malignant; women have a good chance of surviving 

them.<p>

In recent years doctors have increasingly encountered a fourth, somewhat 

different type of breast tumor: <a href="http://www.cancer.org/facts.html">

<I>in situ</I></a>  cancer. Twenty years ago <I>in situ</I> tumors made up

 no more than one or two percent of all 

breast-cancer cases. Today the figure is 10 percent or more, a five- to 

ten-fold increase. <I>In situ</I> tumors are usually small--half an 

inch or less across--and confined to the ducts and lobules of the 

breast. When diagnosed, these tumors usually appear not to have invaded 

the connective tissue or spread elsewhere in the body; like 

well-differentiated tumors, <I>in situ</I> tumors are not likely to be 

fatal.<p>

I must caution that breast-cancer characterization remains an inexact 

science. The categories themselves are fuzzy. Well-differentiated and 

<I>in situ</I> tumors can occasionally grow fast and develop into serious, 

even fatal, disease; some poorly differentiated tumors respond amazingly 

well to treatment. The uncertainty is partly due to a lack of absolute 

procedures for distinguishing among the three classifications. Often a 

tumor is classified as poorly differentiated by one pathologist and 

moderately differentiated by another. Neither doctor could be accused of 

making a mistake.<p>

More important, the degree of differentiation does not by itself describe 

the malevolence of a tumor. It is important to know too if the tumor cells 

respond to estrogen and progesterone--that is, whether they retain the 

biochemical equipment to link up physically with molecules of these 

hormones. (Given the apparent role of hormones in promoting the disease, 

their significance in its outcome is unsurprising.) Up to two thirds of 

all breast tumors have enough sensitivity to reproductive hormones to be, 

in the jargon, estrogen- or progesterone-receptor-positive; such tumors 

tend to grow relatively slowly and can be treated by modifying a woman's 

hormonal environment, either with drugs or (rarely) by removing the 

ovaries. Estrogen- or progesterone-receptor-negative tumors generally have 

poorer outcomes. <p>

Even when such complicating factors are considered, though, the tumor's 

degree of differentiation is a reasonably accurate approximation of its 

virulence. The less resemblance cancer cells bear to the tissue that 

spawned them, the worse the prognosis for the patient.<p>

Notwithstanding the myriad forms in which breast cancer presents itself, 

researchers believe that at a fundamental level all breast cancers are 

similar. In their view, breast cancer, like other cancers, is the result 

of accidental changes in the genetic makeup of a cell--mutations. When 

the cell reproduces, it passes on its altered DNA. It begins to reproduce 

independently, regardless of the body's needs--the defining 

characteristic of cancer. Cells depend on nutrients and oxygen from the 

bloodstream. Under ordinary circumstances aberrant, independently growing 

cells would outpace the available blood supply by the time they had formed 

a blob of tissue one or two millimeters in diameter; they would then die 

from a lack of oxygen and food. Instead cancer cells--by means that 

remain frustratingly unclear--create their own network of blood 

vessels to secure necessary nutrients. Once this circulatory system is 

established, the nascent tumor can continue to grow at its own pace. 

Eventually a discrete mass of aberrant cells becomes identifiable, either 

as a denser area on a mammogram or as a lump detectable by touch. <p>

As the cancer progresses, it can invade the surrounding tissue and spread 

throughout the body in the familiar and frightening process known as 

metastasis. Metastasis is almost always how breast cancer kills its 

victims. Left untreated, as it generally was in previous centuries, the 

original, or primary, tumor usually grows very large, sometimes to the 

size of a grapefruit. Eventually it begins to outstrip its self-generated 

blood supply; portions of the tumor die, leading to ulceration of the 

breast surface and eventual death from infection, hemorrhage, or both. 

Today this peril is avoided with relative ease by removing the tumor. The 

metastases are quite another problem. As it grows, the primary tumor sheds 

cancer cells into its self-generated network of blood vessels. Spreading 

through the body, these cells can lodge in almost any vital organ, 

creating a second tumor--or a third, or a fourth. Like the primary 

tumor, the new tumors create their own blood supply, each one siphoning 

off nutrients from the body to feed its expansion. When the metastases 

reach an appreciable aggregate size--a total tumor load of two pounds 

or so, scattered throughout the body--the struggle for life is usually 

over.<p>

From an intellectual point of view, metastasis is an amazing phenomenon. 

If a surgeon inserted a microscopic clump of normal cells from a woman's 

breast into another organ, the body's defense systems would wipe out the 

misplaced normal cells almost instantly. Yet cancer cells that split off 

from the main tumor and lodge elsewhere in the body not only survive but 

can grow exuberantly. For this reason most doctors believe that the best 

method for stopping breast cancer is to detect it before it has spread. 

Find the problem while it is still small and isolated--that is the 

hope. <p>

The best method for early clinical detection of breast cancer is 

mammography. The American Cancer Society advises women aged forty to 

forty-nine to have mammograms every one to two years, and women aged fifty 

and over to have them annually. Women with any potential cancer symptoms, 

such as suspicious lumpiness of the breast, should see their doctor 

immediately.  <p>

We have been trying to treat breast cancer aggressively for decades. Many 

physicians now believe that the long effort to detect and control this 

disease is meeting with success. I shall argue otherwise. Despite the 

hopes pinned on mammography, it has had little impact on women's 

health--indeed, it may have had none. And although we have taken some 

important steps forward in our treatment of breast cancer once it has been 

diagnosed--steps that can add years to a woman's life--we are 

still far from curing the disease.<P><br>

<CENTER><b>DOES <br>

MAMMOGRAPHY HELP?</b><p>

</CENTER>Finding breast cancer as early as possible seems to be a great 

idea, like trying to diagnose high blood pressure before it damages the 

heart or the kidneys. And mammograms can occasionally detect tumors as 

small as an eighth of an inch across, whereas the lower limit for tumors 

diagnosable by palpation (examining the breast manually) is about half an 

inch across. Yet one would like to be sure that this difference actually 

translates into a higher likelihood that treatment will be successful. An 

official nationwide mammography program would be a huge commitment: 51.5 

million American women are aged forty or above. And one must bear in mind 

the cost of needless medical procedures generated by the huge number of 

false-positive mammograms--two to four false positives for every true 

positive, according to some measures. (A false positive shows a mass or 

lump that proves after further testing not to be cancerous.)We continue to 

consider creating a national screening program, but I believe it has never 

been proved that such a program would, on balance, be beneficial--even 

if it served the secondary purpose of bringing into the health-care system 

women who otherwise could not afford it or would not see a doctor 

frequently.<p>

To prove the value of mammography scientifically is more difficult than it 

might seem. In some studies investigators ask women to volunteer for 

screening, and then report the number of breast-cancer cases and the 

percentage of women who survive five years after diagnosis. This figure is 

compared with the percentage in the population at large. In these studies 

researchers often go to considerable trouble to eliminate potential 

sources of confusion. For example, they may try to match by age the women 

undergoing regular mammography with other women. Or they may match by race 

or socioeconomic class. No matter how hard researchers try, though, such 

studies remain susceptible to three of the most common sources of bias in 

medical research. <p>

Mammography may find a tumor as early as two years before it could have 

been detected by palpation. Let us, however, consider a hypothetical case 

in which the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body by the 

time it is discovered, and the woman goes to her grave on exactly the same 

day she would have if the tumor had been discovered later. In that case 

the sole effect of early detection has been to stretch out the time in 

which the woman bears the knowledge of her condition. But that is not how 

the woman would appear statistically if she had happened to become part of 

a research study. Pushing back the date of first diagnosis would increase 

the interval between diagnosis and death, apparently lengthening her 

survival. Statisticians call this effect "lead-time bias." Although 

nothing has actually changed, a woman who would have died, say, three 

years after treatment now dies five to six years after 

treatment--manufacturing an apparent victory for medicine. <p>

A second problem with measuring the benefits of mammography is known as 

"length bias." Women typically have mammograms every year or every other 

year. Any cancers that are found between mammograms will be detected by 

palpation--very possibly by the woman herself. Such tumors are likely 

to be fast-growing; indeed, their rapid onset often explains why they were 

not picked up by the previous mammogram. The more aggressive tumors tend 

not to be diagnosed mammographically, and thus the tumors that are 

discovered by mammograms are often less dangerous. Mammography will be 

made to look good in a study comparing the survival rate of women whose 

tumors were diagnosed by mammography with that of women whose tumors were 

diagnosed by palpation, because the tumors discovered by mammography tend 

to be those that grow relatively slowly and thus take longer to kill 

patients. <p>

The third and most important problem is "selection bias." This occurs when 

researchers measure the effect of a treatment on a group of people without 

realizing that those people are different from the general population. The 

risks that selection bias will occur are high, because women who 

participate in medical experiments are often not like the general 

population. Researchers typically work in teaching hospitals and thus draw 

their subjects from the patients who frequent them. These people may be 

more affluent than most Americans, and thus more prone to diseases of 

affluence. Or they may be more worried about their health, and thus more 

likely to seek expert medical care. In either case, the results of a test 

on such a select group can be misleading. <p>

Many researchers agree that lead-time, length, and selection biases may 

flaw the optimistic accounts of the efficacy of mammography that have 

appeared in the scientific press and the popular media. Nonetheless, they 

support the idea of routinely screening women. The principal reason is 

that benefits from mammography have been observed in a special kind of 

study known as a prospective randomized clinical trial. In such a trial 

researchers randomly divide large numbers of volunteers into two groups at 

the outset (prospectively): a control group, which receives ordinary 

medical care; and a test group, which receives the medication or procedure 

under scrutiny. After a given period of time the two groups are compared. 

Properly conducted, such trials avoid all three kinds of bias. Even 

prospective randomized clinical trials have their pitfalls, though, 

because doctors can't control the actions of their patients. Members of 

the test group may fail to take their medicine or to show up for their 

medical procedures, and members of the control group may seek out a drug 

or procedure they are not supposed to have. As hard as researchers may try 

to ascertain levels of compliance, misclassification of a certain number 

of participants is inevitable. In addition, the medical care provided at  

research centers, which often conduct clinical trials, may not be 

representative of the care received by most people.<p>

Nonetheless, by ensuring from the beginning that the test group and the 

control group are statistically similar and by tracking everyone in both 

groups, these trials can produce data that are as solid as medical 

research gets. And several big prospective randomized clinical trials have 

reported that women who regularly undergo mammography have, roughly 

speaking, 25 to 30 percent less chance of dying from breast cancer in the 

decade after initial screening than women who are not screened. Most 

breast-cancer specialists thus endorse mammography. <p>

In fact the evidence from these trials is weaker than it sounds. In April 

of last year an article in <I>Cancer</I> summarized all eight of the major 

mammography trials that have been conducted to date. Six of the trials saw 

no significant decreases in breast-cancer mortality as a result of 

mammography. "Significant," an important term, means that statistical 

tests indicate that the effect is probably not due to chance. Also, the 

two significant clinical trials were the first ones completed. "Should the 

early trials be accepted as the gold standard and the later ones dismissed 

as somehow incompetent?" Charles J. Wright, of the University of British 

Columbia, and C. Barber Mueller, of McMaster University, asked in <I>The 

Lancet </I>last July. "Surely not, in view of the increasing rigour of 

trial design over the past 30 years and the vast improvement in quality of 

mammography." Indeed, the two earliest trials have serious potential 

shortcomings. Explaining these shortcomings involves delving still further 

into technical details; some readers may wish to skip the next section of 

this article entirely. The gist of my argument is that the benefits of 

frequent mammography as opposed to palpation performed during regular 

checkups and also by a woman herself are not well established; if they do 

exist, they are not as great as many women hope. <P><br>

<CENTER><b>STATISTICAL <br>

TROUBLES</b><p>

</CENTER>The more important historically of the two trials that showed 

significant benefits is known as the HIP trial, after the Health Insurance 

Plan of Greater New York, the health-maintenance organization from which 

the researchers gathered participants. A classic of medical research, the 

HIP trial enrolled 60,696 patients from 1963 to 1966 and followed them for 

as long as eighteen years. In 1988 two of its principal investigators, Sam 

Shapiro and Philip Strax, won the Charles F. Kettering Prize for 

outstanding cancer research, both because the trial was one of the 

earliest large-scale attempts to test a preventive health measure and 

because it showed that periodic mammography reduced breast-cancer 

mortality by 30 percent over a ten-year period.<p>

Notwithstanding the accolades awarded to this pioneering effort, it 

suffered from methodological weaknesses. In clinical trials, as I have 

said, the subjects should be randomly distributed between the test group 

(in this case women who received annual mammograms and clinical breast 

examinations) and the control group (women who received ordinary medical 

care from their own doctors). Experimenters always fear that they may 

introduce bias by inadvertently including or excluding the wrong people. 

The HIP trial demonstrates why they worry. <p>

In this experiment the researchers assigned women to the test and control 

groups alternately in order of enlisting, a process intended to produce 

groups of equal size and composition. After assigning a woman to the test 

group the researchers made two simple determinations: Was she pregnant? 

Had she had breast cancer?If the answer to either of these was yes, 

Shapiro and Strax made the woman ineligible for the test group. They did 

not, of course, want to x-ray pregnant women. Nor did they think it a good 

idea to include women with breast cancer, because administering mammograms 

to women who had already been treated for the disease would not be a 

proper test of mammography for the purposes of the study. The test group 

of 30,131 women thus wound up with 434 fewer subjects than the control 

group of 30,565 women. <p>

Shapiro and Strax gave the women in the test group annual mammograms and 

breast examinations for as long as five years. They then counted up the 

number in each group who died of breast cancer within ten years and 

compared the two figures. Because 147 died in the test group and 193 died 

in the control group, Shapiro and Strax concluded that mammography was 

beneficial. But was it?The researchers themselves attributed the "higher 

proportion"of the benefit, at least in the first five years, to clinical 

breast examination--that is, palpation. In order to be certain that 

the remaining benefit was due to mammography, one would have to confirm 

that excluding from the test group the 434 women who either were pregnant 

or had had breast cancer did not skew the results. <p>

The ages of the women in the HIP study ranged from forty to sixty-four. 

Because few women in this age range are pregnant, most of the subjects 

excluded from the test group were surely dropped for having had breast 

cancer. In order to guarantee that the test and control groups were 

identical, the investigators would also have had to identify and exclude 

all the women in the control group who had breast cancer when the 

experiment began, by asking the same two questions they had asked women 

assigned to the test group. But they did not do this--they simply 

filed the names of the women in the control group, without performing any 

initial evaluation. (This was not unusual for control groups of the time.) 

As the trial progressed, the team leaders later wrote, women in the 

control group who "were identified through other sources as having had 

breast cancer diagnosed before their entry dates . . . were dropped from 

the investigation."In other words, the researchers tracked them by looking 

for their names in medical records, insurance claims, and death records; 

if they found evidence that breast cancer had been diagnosed in a member 

of the control group prior to 1963, when the study began, the scientists 

retroactively dropped her from the study. This meant that the researchers 

sometimes had to ascertain the time of diagnosis by finding very old 

records in scattered hospitals or asking family members about events many 

years in the past. <p>

For my own research I have attempted to document medical histories, and 

can report that it is no easy task. Records disappear; memories are 

faulty; people move. More than half the subjects in the HIP study left 

that health-maintenance organization within fifteen years. (In one trial I 

myself inadvertently transmitted incorrect data to its statistical 

administrators: I reported that a deceased patient was alive, because a 

busy doctor's office taking part in the trial was unaware of the death. 

When this omission was discovered, I asked the <a href="http://wwwicic.nci.

nih.gov/">National Cancer Institute</a>

to examine the body of research data Ihad supervised, and I was cleared of 

any wrongdoing.) In my experience people typically underestimate the time 

that has elapsed since a trip to the hospital. Informed of the real date, 

they say, "That long ago? I can't believe that much time has gone by!" In 

those instances when Shapiro and Strax relied on the memories of patients 

and relatives, they almost certainly retained in the control group some 

cancer cases that had actually been diagnosed <I>before </I>the trial 

began--inadvertently stacking the deck in favor of mammography. <p>

A few such slips would be enough to throw off the entire experiment. 

Indeed, if it turned out that Shapiro and Strax had ascribed a mistakenly 

late date of diagnosis to as few as twenty-five women in the control 

group, the failure to exclude them, too, would have changed the study's 

conclusions. Correcting for it would cause the benefit of mammography to 

lose statistical significance--the touchstone of medical research. 

Twenty-five errors is in this case not a big number; it is equivalent to 

about six percent of the 434 patients excluded from the test group. To be 

sure, the trial may have been error-free; although they had not initially 

excluded from the control group women who had had breast cancer, Shapiro 

and Strax wrote that "confidence is warranted" that by the trial's end 

they had identified prior breast-cancer cases equally well in both groups. 

Still, the vulnerability of the conclusions to such a small error is 

troubling. <p>

No such methodological worries seem to afflict the second of the trials to 

show a statistically significant advantage from mammography: the 

Kopparberg study, named after the county in southern Sweden where it took 

place. Beginning in 1977 the Kopparberg trial offered mammography to a 

test group of 38,562 women and ordinary medical care to a control group of 

18,478 women. At the same time, the researchers performed a second big 

trial in another Swedish county. The test group in Kopparberg experienced 

a statistically significant reduction in breast-cancer mortality of 40 

percent; the mortality reduction in the test group in the other county was 

statistically insignificant. <p>

Strangely, though, as the researchers acknowledged, the mortality from all 

causes in the two test groups was "identical" to that in the control 

groups. In 1988 the late Petr Skrabanek, of Trinity College, Dublin, 

pointed out in the <a href="http://www.bmj.com/bmj/"><I>British Medical

 Journal</I></a>, "Not a single life was 

'saved' in a trial that included over 130,000 women" in both counties. The 

women who underwent mammography may have died less frequently of cancer, 

but the gain was offset by deaths from other causes, such as heart attack. 

Presumably the "extra" deaths reflect the workings of chance. But it is 

awkward to argue that a decrease in cancer deaths in the treatment groups 

is meaningful while claiming that an equally great increase in deaths from 

other causes is a fluke. <p>

One of the most recent clinical trials discussed in the <I>Cancer 

</I>article took place in Canada, where a team of physicians gave annual 

mammograms to 44,925 women and ordinary medical care to 44,910 women. The 

researchers enrolled women in the trial from 1980 to 1985 and followed 

their progress for a minimum of seven years. The subjects were divided by 

age into two subgroups: those who were forty to forty-nine when they 

entered the trial, and those who were fifty to fifty-nine. In neither 

subgroup was there an overall difference in mortality from breast cancer 

between the treatment and control groups--mammography had no effect. 

<p>

Mammography supporters immediately dismissed these negative results as 

obvious signs of faulty equipment, poor training, or flawed experimental 

technique. Typical was the reaction of Charles R. Smart, then the director 

of the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control at the National Cancer 

Institute. Without presenting any supporting evidence, Smart dismissed a 

preliminary report from the Canadian researchers by writing in the journal 

<I>Cancer Prevention, </I>in 1990, "The lack of a decrease in mortality 

[in older women] suggests problems in the quality of the mammography in 

this trial." <p>

Others took the Canadian trial more seriously. In a series of steps that 

sowed confusion in many women, the National Cancer Institute and the 

American Cancer Society reviewed all the available evidence about 

mammography, especially for younger women. In October of 1993 the NCI 

reported that mammography provided no certain benefit to women under fifty 

but some benefit to their elders. The American Cancer Society continued to 

endorse routine mammography for all women over forty. The dispute sparked 

by the inability of the Canadian study to find any benefit from routine 

mammography became bitter and personal. Angry critiques poured into the 

journals, and the Canadian researchers defended themselves with equal 

vigor. Contradictory editorials abounded. <p>

The attacks and counterattacks clearly demonstrated how hard it has been 

to prove unequivocally that mammography has a strong beneficial effect on 

women's lives. Trying to resolve the controversy, several research teams 

employed a technique called meta-analysis. Roughly speaking, meta-analysis 

involves adding together the data from many clinical trials to create a 

single pool of data big enough to eliminate much of the statistical 

uncertainty that plagues individual trials. It is accomplished by 

gathering all available studies and comparing them one at a time with the 

"null hypothesis"--in this case the hypothesis that mammography has no 

impact whatever on mortality from breast cancer. If the null hypothesis is 

true, the series of comparisons should randomly differ from zero; added 

together, the chance variations will cancel one another out. If the 

studies consistently find an impact, the comparisons will draw the total 

away from the null hypothesis and toward the actual effect. The great 

virtue of meta-analysis is that clear findings can emerge from a group of 

studies whose findings are scattered all over the map. <p>

In January of last year a team led by Karla Kerlikowse, of the University 

of California at San Francisco, published in the <a href="http://www.ama-assn.

org/journals/"><I>Journal of the 

American Medical Association</I></a> the results of a meta-analysis of the 

eight trials: mammography reduces the seven-to-nine-year mortality from 

breast cancer in women aged fifty to seventy-four by about 23 percent, but 

it has no impact on women in their forties. A second meta-analysis of 

mammography for women in their forties appeared three months later in 

<I>Cancer</I> (the summary referred to above; its authors included Charles 

R. Smart, now retired). Including somewhat more recent data from the same 

trials, with an average follow-up time of 10.4 years, the <I>Cancer</I> 

article concluded that mammography in fact lowered the rate of mortality 

from breast cancer in women aged forty to forty-nine by about 16 percent. 

Indeed, these researchers argued, the true benefit was likely to be 

greater than that. First, the technology of mammograms is constantly 

improving. Second, not all the women in the groups scheduled to receive 

mammograms actually showed up for their examinations. Finally, Smart and 

his associates presented an argument for eliminating from consideration 

the results of the Canadian trial, because it had what they regarded as 

worrisome problems. For instance, almost four times as many advanced 

cancers were diagnosed in the women who had mammograms as in the women in 

the control group--a disproportionately high number of very dangerous 

tumors, which in the critics' view makes the experiment unrepresentative. 

If data from the Canadian trial were discarded, the researchers 

calculated, mammography would lower the rate of mortality from breast 

cancer for women in their forties by 24 percent.<p>

Do the meta-analyses settle the matter? Yes and no. Even if one accepts 

the highest values from these overviews for the risk reduction associated 

with mammography--23 percent for women over fifty, 24 percent for 

women in their forties--the figures do not mean what people think when 

they read headlines about them. The percentages refer to the <I>relative 

</I>risk reduction--a statistical measurement calculated by dividing 

the difference between the risks in the test and control groups by the 

risk in the test group. For example, if a clinical trial shows that a 

treatment cuts the risk of dying from a disease from 70 percent in the 

control group to 50 percent in the test group, the relative risk reduction 

is 70 minus 50, or 20, divided by 50, which works out to 40 percent. This 

percentage sounds large, and it is of great import to medical researchers. 

But it has little to do with the question of interest to individual 

women--the <I>absolute </I> difference in risk between those who are 

screened and those who are not. Using the example I just gave, that 

difference would be 20 percent--half the relative risk reduction. In 

other words, the figure from the meta-analysis is the answer to the 

question "Given that I have breast cancer, how much will I have cut my 

risk of dying if the tumor was detected mammographically?" It is not the 

answer to the question "If I am a typical woman, how much will I cut my 

risk of dying from breast cancer by having an annual mammogram?" <p>

Unfortunately, in this case the absolute reduction is much smaller than 

the relative reduction. According to a rough calculation described by 

Russell Harris and Linda Leininger, of the University of North Carolina at 

Chapel Hill, in the <I>Annals of Internal Medicine </I> in April of last 

year, annual mammographic screening for 10,000 women aged fifty to seventy 

will extend the lives of only two to six of them each year. ("The many 

must be screened to benefit the few," Harris and Leininger remarked.) For 

younger women, they argued, the benefit is even more meager: annual 

screening of 10,000 women in their forties will extend the lives of just 

one or two a year. As Harris and Leininger observed, "the use of the term 

'marginal' to describe this risk reduction seems justified." <p>

Even this small benefit may be more apparent than real. Almost all 

breast-cancer experts agree that mammography, which can diagnose smaller 

tumors, picks up some slow-growing cases of cancer that might otherwise 

never be caught. If these tumors grow sufficiently slowly, they will 

rarely become dangerous in a patient's lifetime. Discovering them will 

thus manufacture an apparent excess of "cures." Because we will detect the 

same number of big, dangerous, fast-growing tumors, the "cures" of 

slow-growing cancers will appear statistically only a number of years 

after diagnosis. Even if mammography had no actual effect on mortality, it 

would still produce a small statistical increase in survival many years 

down the pike. In a clinical trial the test group, with its frequent 

examination by mammography, would have a greater number of less-dangerous 

cancers diagnosed within it than would the control group--a form of 

length bias that would lead predictably to the modest prophylactic effect 

observed in the meta-analyses. <p>

Society should ensure that this effect is worth the cost of obtaining it, 

which includes both the direct cost of mammography itself and the indirect 

cost of biopsies, laboratory analyses, and the time women must take off 

from work for checkups. (The emotional costs of the huge number of false 

positives are substantial too, but cannot be reckoned by this kind of 

accounting.) Charles Wright and C. Barber Mueller calculated in their 

<I>Lancet </I>article what they called a "low" estimate for the cost of 

mammography: $1.2 million for each woman benefited. Two previous 

cost-benefit analyses, they noted, produced comparable figures.<p>

Now contrast the cost of mammography with that of another widely used 

cancer-screening technique: the Pap smear for cervical cancer. Named after 

George Papanicolaou, the physician who developed it in the 1930s, the test 

is less expensive than mammography, simpler to perform, and far more 

reliable. Because the Pap smear can detect cervical cancer in its long 

latent stage, before the cancer invades surrounding tissue, the test is 

widely believed to reduce the mortality of invasive cervical cancer by 90 

percent. According to a study published in 1990 in the <I>Annals of 

Internal Medicine </I>by David Eddy, of the Duke University Center for 

Health Policy Research and Education, screening 10,000 women with a Pap 

smear every three years from their twenties to their seventies would 

prevent about 200 of them from developing invasive cervical cancer; if 

each detected cervical cancer translated into an additional ten years of 

life, the cost to society would be approximately $150,000 per woman 

benefited. Eddy's calculation cannot be directly compared with that of 

Wright and Mueller, because it used a different methodology. Nonetheless, 

it is clear that Pap smears provide much more benefit than mammograms, at 

a small fraction of the cost.<p>

Is mammography worth it? I would argue, with Wright and Mueller, that "the 

benefits of mass population screening, even in older women, are too small 

and the harm and cost generated too great to justify widespread 

implementation of screening mammography." In fact, the authors suggest 

that routine mammography should be recommended only for women at high risk 

of developing breast cancer, such as those whose mothers or sisters 

developed breast cancer early in life. There is little factual basis for 

this plausible-sounding suggestion, though. <p>

A similar radical stance was adopted by Michael Baum, the research 

director of the British Institute of Cancer Research, who quit England's 

national breast-cancer-screening advisory board last September because 

nationwide mammography is "not worth doing." Having helped to set up the 

country's screening program, he was disturbed by claims about the 

effectiveness of mammography. The London <I>Sunday Times </I> quoted Baum 

as saying, "There is a political correctness about screening. I took pride 

in setting up the service, which is as efficient as it can be, but just 

because you are doing something efficiently, it doesn't mean it is worth 

doing." <p>

Abandoning widespread mammography in the United States is probably not 

feasible. After years of effort invested in encouraging mammography, to 

reverse course would cause widespread confusion and anger. Alarmed by the 

contradictory recommendations of "experts," women would probably keep 

having mammograms, just to be safe--and in their shoes I might do the 

same. Moreover, many physicians believe that routine mammography 

encourages women to come in for regular checkups, and thus may play an 

important role in general preventive medicine.<p>

On balance, then, I reluctantly support the status quo. When my patients 

come in for their mammograms, I do not try to dissuade them. But I tell 

them that the most optimistic interpretation of the available evidence 

suggests that routine mammography has only a marginal effect on a woman's 

chances of surviving breast cancer--and that it may have no effect at 

all.<P><br>

<CENTER><b>ARE WE CURING <br>

BREAST CANCER? </b><p>

</CENTER> Once a tumor has been found, whether by mammography or 

palpation, it must be treated. The basis for the contemporary approach 

dates back to the 1890s, when William Halsted, a professor of surgery at 

Johns Hopkins University, developed radical mastectomy--the technique 

for removing a breast, the underlying chest muscles, and the lymph nodes 

in the armpit. A giant in medical history, Halsted was held in such 

respect that surgeons after him took an uncommonly long time to admit that 

his ideas about cancer were off base. He believed that breast cancer oozed 

slowly through the lymphatic system of the body the way foul water from a 

brackish pond travels through ditches to other parts of the landscape. 

(The lymphatic system is the collection of ducts, lymph nodes, and other 

organs that drain the tissue fluid called lymph into the bloodstream.) To 

Halsted's way of thinking, breast cancer could be cured by carving a wide 

swath around the initial tumor and its draining sites, leaving clear 

margins of healthy tissue--a scorched-earth approach. <p>

Seventy-five years later a number of North American researchers began 

questioning Halsted's ideas. Instead of seeping slowly throughout the body 

from its initial site, breast cancer seemed to hop from place to place as 

cells sloughed off by the main tumor mass floated through the bloodstream. 

If this was true, removing a woman's entire breast would often be 

pointless, because most of the tissue surrounding the tumor would be 

healthy. After this heretical notion provoked much controversy among 

cancer specialists, Bernard Fisher, of the University of Pittsburgh, put 

together a series of large clinical trials that were intended to resolve 

the dispute. These trials demonstrated that a much less drastic operation 

called a lumpectomy was appropriate in many cases; when combined with 

radiation therapy it provided a chance of survival indistinguishable from 

that provided by Halsted-style mastectomy. After the results were 

published, in the mid-1980s, surgical practices changed. Remarkably, 

though, they didn't change very fast. Even today only a third of the women 

who undergo breast surgery have lumpectomies, whereas at least two thirds 

probably could, in light of the size of their tumors. The rest have 

modified radical mastectomies, a somewhat less severe version of Halsted's 

operation.<p>

In the same period researchers questioned another tacit assumption about 

breast cancer: that lumps in the breast appear suddenly and must be 

treated quickly. Instead we have come to think that most breast tumors 

take years to develop to detectable size; some need decades. In its 

initial stages the tumor would be visible under a microscope--if one 

could somehow scan the entire breast with such precision. Only after 

months or years, however, can the malignancy be detected on a mammogram or 

by palpation. Yet standard practice still involves a rush to operate after 

diagnosis. The patient wants to know the details of her condition right 

away, and surgical exploration is the only conclusive means of providing 

this information. But surgeons also operate partly in the name of "getting 

this thing out before it spreads." I cannot count the number of times I 

have seen a surgeon solemnly tell anxious family members in the hospital 

waiting room, "Well, we got it all." Although surgeons today target their 

work more carefully and humanely than they did in the past, they still 

ignore a crucial fact: we cannot know whether we "got it all." Although 

our treatments can eliminate the primary tumor (not a small consideration, 

given its potential danger), there is little evidence that we actually 

eradicate breast cancer in any more patients than we did decades ago. <p>

As I said, switching when appropriate from mastectomy to lumpectomy leaves 

survival rates unaffected--the less-severe operation simply does the 

same job. And we have, in my view, less than compelling evidence that 

routine mammography benefits otherwise healthy women. Any improvement in 

our treatment of breast cancer must therefore come from radiation or 

chemotherapy, both of which are by now standard practice. After a 

lumpectomy, according to a meta-analysis published last November in the 

<a href="http://www.nejm.org/">

<I>New England Journal of Medicine</I></a>, radiation decreases the risk of 

recurrence in the breast region (local-regional recurrence, as it is 

known) to that associated with full mastectomy--five to 10 percent 

during the next ten years. Without radiation the risk is about 20 percent. 

But radiation has no known effect on distant metastases from breast cancer 

(nonlocal recurrence), which are the chief sources of danger. As a result, 

post-surgical radiation has no demonstrable effect on survival--a 

point seldom made clear to patients. Reducing local recurrence is a 

reasonable goal, because any tumor in the breast could be lethal. But it 

will not diminish the danger from metastases.<p>

Nor should we think that the modest benefit from radiation has no price. 

Radiation therapy is rough on the body. It kills cells, inducing 

inflammation in the breast. Responding to the inflammation, cells called 

fibroblasts proliferate and lay down scar tissue. Fifteen to twenty-five 

years after radiation therapy tissues in the irradiated area often feel 

thick, hard, even wooden--a strange, unpleasant sensation. Meanwhile, 

the blast of radiation may have created genetic damage that will lead to 

other types of cancer. For instance, worrisome evidence suggests that 

radiation may promote lung cancer in the irradiated side of the body. The 

risk seems slight, but its mere possibility should remind physicians that 

radiation therapy is not without its price. <p>

Chemotherapy is a more complex issue, with better-established benefits and 

fewer side effects than it had in the past. Chemotherapeutic compounds 

kill cancer cells; the hope is that they will destroy any metastases 

lurking in the body. Thirty years ago chemotherapy was a treatment of last 

resort, administered only to patients with extensive metastatic disease. I 

can recall flying overnight to the University of Wisconsin in 1959 to pick 

up some precious vials of 5-fluorouracil, one of the first, 

then-experimental chemotherapeutic treatments, for a woman whose cancer 

was overwhelming her liver. I was dismayed when the drug made her 

extremely sick, though I thought that it might have postponed her death a 

little. In the early 1970s researchers discovered that chemotherapy was 

also effective when several agents were administered right after 

surgery--as an adjuvant treatment, in the jargon. Today chemotherapy 

is usually given in the form of a pharmaceutical cocktail, one of the most 

common being cyclophosphamide (sold principally under the trade name 

Cytoxan), doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and the original 5-fluorouracil (sold 

under several names, but usually called 5-FU). Although we have discovered 

how to moderate the side effects of chemotherapy, it is still heavy going. 

Common complaints include fatigue, nausea, hair loss, mouth sores, 

diarrhea, and premature menopause. <p>

Chemotherapy is more effective in younger, pre-menopausal women than in 

older, postmenopausal women. Many researchers believe that premenopausal 

women receive this extra benefit because the drugs chemically destroy the 

function of their ovaries, frequently stopping their monthly 

estrogen-progesterone cycles. The decline in hormone production affects 

the two out of three tumors that are estrogen- or 

progesterone-receptor-positive. Deprived of the chemical catalyst they 

need to grow, the metastases often shrink, lengthening the time until they 

become dangerous.<p>

Before chemotherapy, doctors sought to create a similar effect by directly 

removing patients' ovaries. If the cancer recurred, they tried to amplify 

the effect by removing women's adrenal glands. These small, triangular 

organs sit atop the kidneys and secrete hormones, one of which is DHEA, a 

still-mysterious substance that is a favorite preoccupation of health 

faddists. Most women convert some of the DHEA into estrogen, thus 

producing small amounts of estrogen after menopause. Even cutting out the 

adrenal glands--a procedure involving major abdominal 

surgery--wasn't the final step. In their zeal to combat estrogen, 

doctors also injected women with testosterone or prescribed synthetic male 

hormones. <p>

Although these treatments sometimes slowed the progress of breast cancer, 

their cumulative impact was horrific and even barbarous. After having the 

breast and underlying tissue on one side of her chest cut away and covered 

with a thin skin graft, a woman could be subjected to intense radiation 

therapy, primitive forms of chemotherapy, the removal of her ovaries, and, 

eventually, the removal of her adrenal glands. If this failed, she might 

be injected with male hormones that made her skin oily, pimply, and hairy. 

<p>

Things are better today. Surgery is often less severe; chemotherapy can be 

more tolerable; and, perhaps most important, there is a substitute for 

removing the adrenal glands and injecting women with testosterone. In the 

1970s researchers discovered that the actions of estrogen and other 

hormones can be blocked chemically by drugs called hormone antagonists, of 

which the most noteworthy is tamoxifen, which is sold under the trade name 

Nolvadex. Circulating in the body, tamoxifen molecules prevent breast 

cells from linking up to estrogen or progesterone molecules by attaching 

themselves to the cells in their place, blocking the hormones completely. 

Because hormones can stimulate the growth of the majority of breast tumors 

that are estrogen- or progesterone-receptor-positive, the potential of 

tamoxifen for treating this type of cancer is clear. (Tumors that do not 

respond to hormones grow faster and are less treatable.) Tamoxifen can 

cause irregular periods or aggravate hot flashes; it also apparently 

increases the risk of uterine cancer. But it is a vast improvement over 

removing women's adrenal glands.<p>

Many studies have shown that the unwanted side effects of chemotherapy and 

antihormonal therapy are offset by the benefits. A compelling example is 

the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, an Oxford-based 

meta-analysis of 133 randomized clinical trials around the world which 

examined the effects of chemotherapy and antihormonal tamoxifen therapy on 

74,652 women with breast cancer. In the trials breast-cancer patients were 

usually given mastectomies or lumpectomies and then divided randomly into 

two groups: one that received some type of chemotherapy or antihormonal 

therapy (the test group) and one that did not (the control group). The 

Oxford group reported in 1992 that women who underwent either treatment 

after surgery had a 12 to 14 percent greater chance of surviving for ten 

years than those who did not.<p>

Note, though, exactly how this good news was phrased. The improved 

survival prospect for women who underwent these treatments was in 

comparison with the prospect for breast-cancer patients who received no 

systemic therapy--a relative, rather than absolute, increase in 

survival. Without chemotherapy, a woman with breast cancer faces a 55 

percent chance of dying within ten years, according to the Oxford team. 

Chemotherapy cuts the figure to 48.7 percent, an absolute difference of 

6.3 percent. Similar figures appeared in the tamoxifen trials. After 

surgery 41.2 percent of the women receiving tamoxifen died within ten 

years, whereas 47.4 percent of the control group died--an absolute 

difference of 6.2 percent. The treatments, then, buy some time for some 

women, and this is a very good thing; any woman told that she has even a 

small chance of surviving longer with adjuvant treatment will likely 

choose it. Nevertheless, we should not be extolling these therapies as 

major breakthroughs.<p>

"Wait a minute," some readers may be saying. "Are you being too quick to 

dismiss these results? Don't these decreases in risk mean that we are 

eliminating this disease in some people? It may be a small number, but 

aren't we curing a few more than we did in the past?" These questions are 

difficult to answer, not least because they involve coming up with a good 

definition of "cure." For instance, if a woman of sixty-five is treated 

for breast cancer and then dies five years later of a heart attack, was 

she "cured" of cancer? Her family, friends, and even her doctor might 

think so, because the disease never troubled her again. Indeed, a common 

clinical definition of "cure" is survival for five or ten years. Many 

researchers would be less quick to claim a cure, because the cancer might 

have been on its way to recurring when the heart attack intervened. <p>

Acknowledging these complexities, statisticians evolved a precise 

definition for "cure" in the 1950s. A true cure of a lethal disease like 

breast cancer is achieved <I>only </I>when people with that disease face 

the same chance of death as others in the population of the same age and 

sex. Such true cures are possible with many diseases. Most pneumonia 

sufferers, for instance, after recovering with the aid of antibiotics have 

exactly the same prospects for survival as people who have never had 

pneumonia. Like pneumonia, some cancers, including cervical cancer, 

childhood leukemia, superficial melanomas, and Hodgkin's disease, can be 

truly cured. <p>

Breast cancer, unfortunately, is not among this select group. As far as we 

know, a woman found to have invasive breast cancer is always at higher 

risk of dying prematurely than women without breast cancer. Even thirty 

years after her diagnosis she is up to sixteen times as likely to die of 

the disease as a woman in the general population. That is why responsible 

researchers in this field avoid the word "cure." Even as they report 

advances, they must acknowledge the reality: Postsurgical chemotherapy and 

antihormonal therapy do buy time--an important advance. The slowed 

progress of the disease can give a woman additional years of life and even 

allow her to die of other, less traumatic, causes. But breast cancer is 

every bit as incurable as it was in Halsted's day. <P><br>



<CENTER><b>ANOTHER VIEW <br>OF BREAST CANCER </b> <p>

</CENTER>In 1935, 26.2 out of every 100,000 women died of breast cancer. 

That was a long time ago, of course, when life expectancy for women was 

sixty-four years. Americans now live longer, which means that diseases of 

the elderly are more common. Although breast cancer affects many young 

women, it is still principally a disease of middle and old age--the 

median age at diagnosis is sixty-four. Statisticians must adjust raw data 

about incidence and mortality to compensate for underlying demographic 

shifts. In 1992, the latest year for which figures are available, the 

adjusted rate of mortality was 26.2 women per 100,000--the same as in 

1935. (The death rate rose a bit from 1986 to 1989 and declined by about 

the same amount from 1989 to 1992.) Since 1935 medicine has seen 

improvements in surgical technique and anesthesia, and the introduction of 

mammography, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, along with an enormous 

jump in general medical knowledge. But all this progress has had no effect 

on the chances that an individual woman will die of breast cancer. To my 

way of thinking, the constancy of the death rate in the face of rising 

incidence and aggressive treatment is a strong hint that we need to 

approach the disease in another way. <p>

When I discussed the evidence relating to mammography, radiation, and 

chemotherapy, I was in the realm of fact--although some colleagues may 

disagree with my interpretation. In what follows I am moving into 

unsteadier terrain. Of course, I believe that my view of breast cancer is 

correct, and much of it is shared by other specialists. But I will be 

satisfied if I can persuade readers that the mere existence of a coherent 

alternative explanation raises questions about the mainstream view. <p>

As I have said, almost all cancer researchers think that the disease is 

triggered by an accidental change in the DNA of at least one cell. That 

cell divides, producing two cells, then four, then eight, and so on, with 

the volume of the tumor doubling in each successive generation. By the 

time the tumor has doubled twenty-three times, the original cancer cell 

has multiplied to more than eight million. At that point the tumor is 

about an eighth of an inch in diameter, just big enough to be detected 

(sometimes) by a mammogram. <p>

Such a tumor is not very dangerous by itself; the danger lies in the 

metastases. The question is how soon the tumor metastasizes. <p>

For almost thirty years John S. Spratt, a cancer surgeon now at the 

University of Louisville Department of Surgery, has been measuring the 

growth rates of breast tumors. In one of his most recent studies, 

performed in collaboration with researchers from Heidelberg, Germany, 

Spratt examined the progressive mammograms of 448 women who had tumors 

that turned out to have been visible in mammograms made before the tumors 

were diagnosed. (The women's doctors were not necessarily at fault for 

missing the tumors; in many cases mammographic imagery is ambiguous.) 

Comparing first, second, and even third mammograms provided evidence of 

how fast the tumors grew in the intervals. The median doubling time was 

260 days, but the range was considerable: the fastest tumor doubled in ten 

days, the slowest in 7,051 days--that is, almost twenty years. These 

figures have striking implications. <p>

Consider a woman who is unlucky enough to develop a single cancerous cell 

on her forty-third birthday. If the woman is especially unlucky, the cell 

has a fast doubling time of, say, thirty days. Twenty-three cell 

generations later the tumor might be visible on a mammogram; in another 

six or seven doublings it will be just big enough to feel. By then the 

woman will be forty-five. She will probably die before her fiftieth 

birthday. If, though, the woman develops a cancer with a slow doubling 

time of, say, 360 days, twenty-three doublings will take about 

twenty-three years, at which point the tumor might be seen with 

mammography. The tumor will be palpable in another six or seven years, 

meaning that without mammography it probably would not be detected until 

the woman was in her mid-seventies. By that age some people have already 

died of other causes. <p>

I have simplified these calculations considerably. Spratt and his German 

colleagues found that breast cancers do not grow at a constant rate but 

instead slow down as time passes. Yet the principle holds that tumors that 

begin with fast doubling rates grow faster than tumors that begin with 

slow doubling rates at comparable stages of formation. <p>

Close scrutiny of tumor doubling times could explain why the earlier 

diagnoses provided by mammography seem to provide so little prolonging of 

individual lives, despite the statistical appearance of benefit caused by 

earlier diagnosis. Although mammography is able to spot tumors as small as 

an eighth of an inch, which contain eight million cells, the average size 

at diagnosis with mammography is about 600 million cells. Such a tumor is 

only a bit more than a quarter of an inch across, but it has already 

doubled almost twenty-seven times and may have been in the body for 

decades. The average size of tumors detected by palpation is about 45 

billion cells and about an inch and a quarter in diameter; these tumors 

have doubled an additional eight or nine times. To argue that earlier 

diagnosis provides an important benefit, one must believe that the tumor 

is considerably likelier to spread in those eight or nine later doublings 

than it was in the preceding twenty-seven. <p>

There is no evidence that this is the case; indeed, the small amount of 

available data suggests that this view is wrong. With mammography we can 

see breast tumors earlier than we could before. But it is illogical to 

assume that our newfound ability to observe breast tumors between the 

twenty-seventh and thirty-fifth doublings means that they are especially 

likely to spread during this time or afterward and not before. If tumors 

are more likely to metastasize after rather than before mammography can 

detect them, the burden is on mammography advocates to demonstrate it. 

Meanwhile, I believe that the reasonable course is to assume that breast 

cancer can spread at any time in its development, and that metastasis has 

probably already occurred by the time we are able to detect the primary 

tumor. If this view is correct--and I should stress that studies to 

prove it have not yet been conducted--then it would explain why 

research has had such difficulty proving that mammography can save women's 

lives.<p>

Similarly, examination of tumor doubling times could explain why 

chemotherapy boosts five- and ten-year survival rates but has little 

impact on the annual percentage of women who die of breast 

cancer--that is, why it helps women with the disease to live longer 

but leaves them just as likely to die of metastatic breast cancer in the 

end. My best guess is that adjuvant chemotherapy wipes out 95 to 99.9 

percent of the residual cancer cells in a patient's body. (It doesn't get 

them all because the remaining tumor cells are innately resistant to 

chemotherapy.) Expressed as a percentage, the figures are impressive, but 

the actual impact is surprisingly slight. Suppose that a woman's tumor has 

metastasized and that the new tumor has grown to a million cells--a 

lot of cells, but not enough to be seen by the naked eye, or palpated, or 

spotted by any current imaging method (CAT scan, ultrasound, magnetic 

resonance imaging, and so on). If chemotherapy kills 99 percent of the 

cancer cells in a woman's body, this prophylactic treatment will reduce 

the metastasis from a million cells to 10,000. The remaining cells, which 

are resistant to chemotherapy, will keep on proliferating, more than 

likely at the same rate. In six and two thirds cell generations the tumor 

will have grown back to a million cells and the woman will be right back 

where she was before treatment began. <p>

Cruelly, chemotherapy helps least those who need it most. If a woman's 

cancer has the short doubling time of thirty days, the six and two thirds 

doublings the tumor needs to recover from chemotherapy translate into 

about 200 days. Because chemotherapy is often administered monthly for six 

months, the gain is roughly equivalent to the length of treatment. 

Producing so much suffering, chemotherapy would in this case be a dubious 

exercise. If the woman's cancer has a doubling time of 360 days, however, 

she would gain 2,400 days, which is six and a half years. That sounds like 

a good payoff, but does she need it?If cancer were diagnosed in that woman 

at sixty-four (the median age of diagnosis), her slow-growing metastases 

would probably not become life-threatening for twenty to twenty-five 

years, when she would be in her late eighties. Because most people do not 

live that long, there would be little point in subjecting her to a round 

of chemotherapeutic treatment that would give her another seven years when 

she probably would die of something else in the meantime. If chemotherapy 

has little impact on a woman's chance of surviving either aggressive or 

indolent tumors, is it any wonder that it makes few inroads on mortality? 

<p>

At the same time, chemotherapy should not be dismissed. The calculations 

above, for doubling times of thirty and 360 days, represent extremes; I 

used them to illustrate my point. A more representative example would 

apply Spratt's median doubling time of 260 days to my hypothetical 

forty-three-year-old woman. If, as before, the first cancer cell develops 

on her birthday, the resultant tumor could take eighteen to twenty years 

to show up on a mammogram. (Such calculations are necessarily inexact, 

because individual tumors do not always grow at the same rate.) The woman 

would then be in her early sixties--near the median age of diagnosis. 

With no treatment other than lumpectomy, she would be likely to die before 

the age of seventy-five. But if chemotherapy gave the woman the time it 

would take the tumor to double another six or seven times, the onset of 

life-threatening metastatic disease would be postponed until the woman was 

at least eighty; antihormonal therapy might buy an equivalent number of 

years. In real terms the achievement would probably be smaller, because 

people in their eighties are likely to die of heart disease or some other 

condition. Nonetheless, the woman would have gained five to ten years of 

life. This is a precious gift, one that she and her doctor can justly 

celebrate. <p>

But consider the breast-cancer patients doctors most dread 

seeing--women in their thirties or forties. Such cases are relatively 

uncommon; breast cancer owes its status as the leading killer of women in 

this age group mostly to the even lower likelihood that they will be 

killed by anything else. Nonetheless, the individual tragedy of a disease 

that strikes down young, vibrant people makes it disproportionately urgent 

to treat them. Sadly, younger women in whom cancer is diagnosed are more 

likely than older women to have fast-growing tumors, because slow-growing 

tumors are usually still too small to detect. Given the probable doubling 

rates, these women will be lucky if we can give them an extra five years. 

Five years is, of course, much better than nothing--but much less than 

the thirty or forty years these women will lose. Anyone who treats younger 

breast-cancer patients knows that we will not have made major progress in 

the treatment of this disease until we can give women like these, with 

fast-growing cancers, thirty doubling times rather than six or 

seven.<P><br>

<CENTER><b>CANCER OLD AND NEW</b><p>

</CENTER>In effect, mammography today provides our definition of breast 

cancer. Any tumor spotted on a mammogram is treated, almost reflexively, 

with surgery, radiation, and often chemotherapy and antihormonal drugs. 

Thinking about doubling times suggests the inadequacy of this approach. 

When doctors diagnosed breast cancer by palpation in annual exams, they 

found principally fast-growing tumors--ones whose average doubling 

time, according to the work of Spratt and other researchers, was about 

ninety days. Despite decades of work, medicine still is unable to treat 

this kind of cancer effectively. Today the spectrum of breast cancer is 

different. Perhaps because of the hormonal changes created by the changes 

in women's lives, physicians are increasingly likely to observe the "new" 

cancer described above, which is slower-growing and much less dangerous. 

These cancers, because they progress so much more slowly, have a radically 

different impact on women's lives. For that reason we should be more 

discriminating in how we treat them.<p>

"New" may be a misnomer for this slow-growing breast cancer. Although its 

incidence has risen, I suspect that it has been with us for at least fifty 

years; we just weren't able to see it. In fact, I would not be surprised 

if someday we are all found to harbor somewhere in our bodies several 

small, slow-growing tumors that will never cause us any problems. (They 

are beaten to the punch by cardiovascular disease or faster-growing 

cancers.) <p>

Among the most important varieties of the new breast cancer is the <I>in 

situ</I> tumor--the small, localized, almost nongrowing tumor that at 

the time of diagnosis has seemingly neither become invasive nor developed 

the capacity to metastasize. Prior to mammography, as noted earlier, <I>in 

situ</I> tumors accounted for only one to two percent of all breast-cancer 

diagnoses, whereas today in communities where people see doctors often and 

have lots of tests, <I>in situ</I> tumors account for at least 10 percent 

of all breast-cancer diagnoses. After lumpectomy and radiation, only one 

out of ten <I>in situ</I> malignancies recurs in the next five to eight 

years. <p>

Most of my colleagues celebrate this as a triumph, because it appears that 

we are catching cancers earlier than ever and curing more of them. They 

may be right. But consider this--if one out of ten <I>in situ 

</I>cancers recurs after treatment, nine out of ten do not. If my view is 

correct, even without treatment many or most <I>in situ</I> cancers would 

never have grown big enough to be detected by palpation, let alone to pose 

a threat to life. They might even have become invasive and metastasized, 

but the metastases would also be too small to be detectable and would 

never be lethal--rendering the recurrence rate and thus the question 

of treatment ultimately unimportant to survival. As a result, mammography 

is only leading physicians to diagnose an ever-larger number of harmless 

tumors. Patients who otherwise would never have known they have cancer may 

needlessly suffer through the unique pain, anxiety, disfigurement, and 

expense associated with modern medicine and cancer. For all we know, the 

chief effect of mammography has been to disguise our inability to cure the 

old cancer, by burying it in cases of new cancer. <P><br>

<CENTER><b>WHEN THE DIAGNOSIS <br>

IS POSITIVE </b> <p>

</CENTER>Because of the prevalence of <I>in situ </I> and other 

slow-growing breast cancers, women who receive a positive mammogram should 

not despair. Two thirds to four fifths of positive mammograms lead to 

biopsies that do not reveal cancer. Even if the biopsy indicates cancer, 

the patient should keep in mind that not all tumors are truly dangerous, 

and she should strive to learn what kind of tumor she has.<p>

Although scientists are divided in their opinion of its accuracy, I 

believe that one of the most promising gauges of risk is the "S-phase 

fraction," which is a rough measure of a tumor's doubling time, derived 

from a technique known as flow cytometry. Technicians calculate this 

measure by chopping up a small amount of tumor tissue in a kind of 

specialized blender, staining the cell nuclei with a dye, and squirting 

the result one cell at a time through a very fine nozzle. The cells shoot 

through a thin laser beam, each nucleus casting a shadow as it crosses the 

light. Computers record the shadows with enough detail to discern the 

approximate percentage of cells in the sample that are dividing. From 

these data physicians can infer whether the cancer is aggressive (a 

doubling time of sixty days or less), moderate (sixty-one to 150 days), 

indolent (151 to 300 days), or very indolent (more than 300 days). Because 

tumor growth rates may change over time, and metastases do not necessarily 

march in lockstep with the tumors that spawned them, the actual situation 

faced by patients is more complex than indicated by this summary. 

Nevertheless, Ibelieve that the broad principle holds:armed with 

information about a tumor's growth rate and the patient's age at 

diagnosis, doctors could often be more informative than they are now about 

what lies ahead for their patients. <p>

If doctors could accurately gauge tumor growth rates, using any 

agreed-upon test, my strong hunch is that about a third of the tumors now 

detected would be found not to need treatment beyond removal of the tumor 

itself. Perhaps another quarter of women in whom breast cancer is 

diagnosed could gain considerable time--enough to take them safely 

into old age--with antihormonal therapy alone. The remainder could be 

helped by the combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, though 

not nearly as much as the providers of these treatments or their patients 

would hope. For this last group of women, I am very sorry to say, modern 

medicine has less to offer than newspaper headlines suggest. The outcome 

was dictated well before diagnosis--by the date the first cancer cells 

developed and by the rate at which they grew. <p>

If, as I suspect, a woman's fate is set very early in the development of a 

tumor, it seems implausible that advances in detection will have an impact 

on the disease. One can always hope that science will develop a wonder 

drug that eradicates tumors completely, even when they can't be seen or 

felt. But for the present I think we should focus research on improving 

our ability to distinguish between women with breast cancer who can 

benefit from aggressive treatment and the larger number who will gain 

little from it no matter what we do. <p>

The ultimate hope is preventing this awful disease, perhaps by modifying 

the contemporary hormonal environment that seems to promote it. 

Researchers at the University of Southern California have been examining 

ways to lower young women's exposure to reproductive hormones. Another 

approach is to use an anti-estrogen drug like tamoxifen preventively in 

postmenopausal women whose histories of breast problems indicate that they 

are at high risk of developing cancer; I am involved in a study that is 

examining this kind of treatment. The risks in changing the hormonal 

balance of millions of women are considerable, however, and it seems 

likely that any new preventive for breast cancer will have its own side 

effects. <p>

Advances in this area will surely be slow, but they may be the only 

realistic hope for eventually lowering the death rate from breast cancer. 

Meanwhile, we should carefully consider whether we are misleading some 

women with messages of unwarranted hope at the same time that we are 

needlessly terrifying and hurting other women by diagnosing and treating a 

condition that will never pose a threat to their lives.

	<font size=5>"I</font>n all the Western States, except Ohio," says the national commissioner of
education in his report for 1873, "there prevails a nearly uniform school
system, in which county superintendents, subordinate to a State superintendent
of public instruction, oversee schools graded up from elementary to a
respectable secondary training, a State university crowning the whole with its
scientific and classical departments. Illinois has to a certain extent stood
apart from others in this last respect, but the State Industrial University, of
great proportions, is putting her substantially in line with them, especially
as regards scientific studies."<p>

<p>

In perusing the school reports of the West, one is struck with the
overshadowing prominence of the reports of the State as compared with those of
the county superintendents. We have remarked that even in the Middle States the
local officers were less discriminating in their criticisms than those of
Southern New England. In the West they may almost be said to disappear, so
brief and merely statistical are their communications. The State
superintendents, on the other hand, seem to be abler men than those who in
general fill the office in the East, or at least they are more alive to the
problems before them, and more earnest in trying to solve them. They all quote
much from one another and from Horace Mann, and to come upon the same thing in
report after report does not say much for the extent and variety of their
pedagogical reading. The apology for this, however, is that the office-work of
the position in most States is altogether too oppressive, and the compensation
too small, to permit those who fill it to devote themselves to the study of the
science or to the perfecting of the art of education, as they otherwise could
and probably would do.<p>

<p>

At present, the Western education is no doubt in a very crude and rudimentary
state, but the broad foundations of it are being laid so that time cannot but
bring to it a magnificent culmination. While the high-school system does not
exist in all its plenitude, i.e., has not penetrated into the smaller towns to
the same extent as in Massachusetts, yet high schools are in operation in many
Western cities, and very large sums are often spent upon the buildings
appropriated to them. But, better than this, the authorities of the
universities of three leading States, Michigan, Wisconsin, and California, have
opened their doors without further examination to the graduates of all high
schools which will grade their classes to the college standard, and they have
appointed committees from their faculties to visit these schools annually.
Michigan was the first to initiate this union between her high schools and her
university, and the State superintendent thus sums up its benefits: "Such a
policy cannot fail to prove a stimulus to our high schools, and lead to the
adoption of better devised courses of study. That exclusiveness, too, which
bred indifference in days gone by, has given way to a freedom of intercourse
between the instructors in the university and the public schools which predicts
a happier condition for each. The president of the university becomes the
presiding officer of the State teachers' association. He strikes hands with the
superintendents and principals of our Union schools at the educational
meetings. A free interchange of views is had, which results in a better
understanding of the wishes and wants of the university, and in a practical
unanimity of feeling and action." In Wisconsin, "the effect of the new
measure," says the State superintendent, Rev. Samuel Fellows, "has thus far
been most beneficial. All over the State, students are preparing in the graded
schools near their homes for the university. As might have been anticipated and
desired, the number of students in the preparatory department has diminished,
while that in the college classes has increased. Other States are making
efforts to connect their graded schools with their universities in like manner,
and in some places denominational colleges are opening their classes to
students similarly prepared." Mr. Fellows took office in 1870 for the express
purpose of trying to bring, by this measure, free education throughout the
State into a consistent whole. "The vital bond," he said, "between the
university and the common school is the high school," and he disapproved of the
preparatory school of the university as tending to make citizens slow to
develop high schools in their own neighborhoods, and as taking away the pupils
too early from their homes. How important this movement is to the Western
colleges will appear from the fact that they themselves are obliged to prepare
eighty-three out of every hundred students who enter their classes, while the
New England colleges are burdened with the preparation of only one in a
hundred, so that the Hon. Newton Bateman, of Illinois, as well as the
superintendents of Michigan and Missouri, concurs with Mr. Fellows in the
desirableness of "bringing the higher instruction to the very doors of the
people, in order to save the expense and the moral and social risks incidental
to boarding-schools and other institutions remote from the salutary restraints
of home." This is the reverse of much thinking that we find in high educational
quarters in the East. Our national commissioner, for example, General John
Eaton, finds it "desirable that in addition to the public high schools there
should be a class of endowed and chartered schools,...for the sake of variety
of means and modes of education, and of the mutual influence of schools
differently organized in competition for excellence....The high school is
usually the home school. It is often a great advantage to the young student to
be thrown during some portion of his secondary schooling into new scenes and
associations;...narrow, home-bred fancies are dispelled, and he perhaps
receives his first impressive discipline in manliness and self-control." This
sounds well, but the moral evils of boarding-schools, so forcibly indicated by
the philosopher Locke, remain just as true to-day as when he wrote them apropos
of Eaton and Harrow in England two hundred years ago. Of two evils a good
boarding-school is better than an unhappy or ill-regulated home, but that a
good day-school, whether public or private, is the best of all schools is the
true dictum of American belief and experience.<p>

<p>

The earnest support given by the Western superintendents to their collegiate
system is in such marked contrast to the silence of the Eastern superintendents
upon the same subject, that we cannot refrain from one or two extracts as
specimens of their spirit. The superintendent of Indiana says, "The university
is not independent of the common schools, nor are they independent of the
university. They are natural aids. The latter supplies the common schools with
teachers, and in turn they supply it with students. No jealousy should exist
between them. All are integral parts of the same great educational system....It
is the very highest interest of a State to provide facilities for an extended
education. While her prosperity is in great measure dependent upon the general
intelligence of her people, there is at the same time a most imperious demand
for men of a high order of culture and scientific attainments. Who can
calculate to a country the real value of a Columbus or a Fulton, of a Newton or
a Franklin? The university that gives to the world only ONE such man repays the
public a thousand fold for all expenditures. Without the universities, the
sciences are practiced; within, they are created. Books are read without, but
written within. These are the fountains whence issue the streams of thought,
and they sustain a relation to our common schools like that of the ocean to the
lakes, pools, rivers, rivulets, and springs." The Hon. Newton Bateman, of
Illinois, the most experienced as well as the ablest State superintendent of
the West, thus answers the question how far a State should undertake to provide
for the education of its children at public cost. "I would see every American
State add to the elementary school, the grammar school; to the grammar school,
the high school; to the high school, the State university; and to the State
university I would see the American Congress add a national university, as a
fitting top-stone to the whole magnificent edifice. And I would have the whole
FREE--every door flung wide open, and the invitation repeated along the whole
line from one end of it to the other, 'Whosoever will, let him come'...A
portion of the public domain surrendered during the last ten years to the
rapacity of monster monopolies...would have reared in every State of the Union
a free university....Meanwhile, the little that was saved in better days and
consecrated to the education of the people is often grudgingly allowed; the
free universities and colleges are crippled for means, and a determined effort
is made to force the States to call in their advanced free-school out-posts,
close their high schools and colleges, and retire within the elementary lines
of fifty years ago.<p>

<p>

Besides the affiliation of the high schools with the Western State
universities, Western superintendents and teachers are now urging the
inauguration of a normal department in the latter, wherein those who intend to
engage in teaching can go through a course and receive a special degree in
pedagogy and psychology. In their opinion, this would do much to secure for
teaching a public recognition as a profession, since all other liberal
professions have their appropriate college degrees. When this is accomplished,
so that the principals of schools shall be college-bred men and women in at
least the same proportion that doctors and lawyers and clergymen are so; when,
too, the high-school system thoroughly permeates the whole community, so that
all the assistants shall be high-school graduates, the necessity, as we cannot
but think, for those make-shifts, the "normal school" and the "teachers'
institute," will disappear. The very conception of a school where the teacher
is to learn precisely what he is to teach is stultifying, and if from the first
the progress of education had been sought by connecting pedagogy with the
universities as law and medicine and divinity are connected, instead of
organizing mills called normal schools where teachers are ground out by the
dozen, the whole question of public-school instruction would have been in a
very different state from its present one. Such a degree now inaugurated by the
Western colleges would act as a needed stimulus and encouragement to that sex
which seems in our country to have found in teaching its special vocation.
Apropos of the presence of women in colleges, the testimony from the West seems
to be universal that there is none of that falling behind the classes, of that
breaking health, or of those improprieties and immoralities that are so much
dreaded in the East should like educational privileges be opened to them here.
We regret extremely, however, that in the report upon the University of
Michigan the recommendation is made that, from reasons of economy, there be no
longer any separate medical classes for the men and women students. We most
emphatically believe that to instruct the sexes in each other's presence upon
subjects over which nature or training--or both--has drawn a veil of reserve
would be a most disastrous mistake, and would in the long run lead to both
intellectual and moral degradation.<p>

<p>

--We took occasion, a few months ago, when noticing a volume of the Clarendon
Press series of English authors, to speak of the need there was of good and
inexpensive editions of English and American classics for the use of schools,
and of the help that such books would afford in the study of English
literature, now beginning to assume its proper place in courses of education.
The little volume of Oliver Goldsmith's Select Poems [see Endnote] just put
forth by Mr. Rolfe, who has already edited certain of Shakespeare's plays,
comes very near to our ideal of what such a book should be. He has taken The
Traveler, The Deserted Village, and Retaliation, prefixed an introduction, and
appended notes. The introduction contains Macaulay's Life of Goldsmith with
omissions, and selections from other memoirs by Thackeray, Forster, Irving,
George Colman the younger, and Campbell. By this means he has not only given
different views of the poet, but also used the reflective interest which
proceeds from the comments of one eminent author upon another. The notes take a
wide range of explanation and suggestion, and can hardly fail to be helpful to
both teacher and scholar. We have been interested in comparing them with those
by Mr. Hales, who has prepared a similar edition in England. Mr. Rolfe has
acknowledged his indebtedness to the English author, but his use of Hales's
work has been both honest and discriminating, The American edition is much
better adapted to use in our schools than the English, since it draws its
historical and literary illustration from a wider range, and confines its
philological notes more distinctly to those authors, ancient and modern, whom
the American reader has been likely to read, or to whose works he has access.
Perhaps it was expedient to introduce the illustrations; we are glad to see the
portrait and Foley's statue, but could well spare the imaginative pictures, if
we could have in place, room for a portion, say, of the thirteenth chapter of
Boswell's Johnson, getting thus not only glimpses of Goldsmith's personality as
it was seen by Boswell, but a taste of a remarkable book which ought to be
introduced to the young reader by such means. The volume is still too
expensive, even at its moderate price, to serve the best purposes of a school
edition, but probably we shall have to work toward cheap and scholarly editions
by degrees, and our complaint in this case is rather based on the supposition
that this is one of a projected series of classics.<p>

	<font size=5>W</font>ith the coming of the Next New Deal, Americans will look back and marvel at what became of our old welfare state--that tangle of inequity and dysfunction once known as federal entitlements. Why did the public tolerate a system that wound up distributing most of its benefits to the well-off? And how did the economy survive its costs?<P>
History books will no doubt concentrate on a few choice examples of the conditions that finally forced a wholesale reform. Readers may learn, for instance, that by 1991 the federal government's largest housing subsidy program was providing an average of $3,000 a year to each of the six million wealthiest households in America, while offering nothing to the 36 million Americans in poverty.<P>
To qualify for this particular benefit, called the home-mortgage deduction, you had to borrow using your first or second home as collateral. And the more you borrowed, even if it was to finance a chalet in Aspen-
or just a ski trip to Aspen--the more subsidy you would receive from other taxpayers. By 1991 the cost of the home-mortgage deduction had risen to $37 billion, of which 81 percent went directly to households with incomes over $50,000. Meanwhile, economists bemoaned the anemic U.S. personal savings rate, which in the late 1980s fell to its lowest level since the 1930s.<P>
The U.S. health-care system a quarter century after the announcement of the Great Society will also provide future historians with rich examples of the conditions that led to the next New Deal. How to explain that the U.S. economy staggered under the highest per capita health-care costs on earth, and still 23 million Americans under the age of thirty-five were uninsured for any medical care at all?<P>
Stranger yet was what happened to these uninsured Americans, and to everyone else, if they happened to live to be sixty-five. After that birthday a citizen, regardless of income, became entitled to take part in a program called Medicare, which would pay for everything from CAT scans to pacemakers, from chiropractic to orthopedic recliners. In 1991 Medicare spent nearly $19 billion subsidizing the health care of households earning $50,000 or more. That year government experts projected that the mounting cost of Medicare would cause the program to collapse within fifteen years, and that if current trends continued, total health-care spending would rise to an economy-shattering 44 percent of the gross national product by 2030. No one listened.<P>
Gold-plated pensions for federal employees will also no doubt be held up by future historians as emblematic of the decadence of late-twentieth
century political culture. By what accident of history were military and civil service retirees with incomes over $100,000 collecting $9.2 billion from the U.S. Treasury in 1991? For half this sum the official poverty rate for all American elderly could have been reduced to zero. At the very least, Congress could have done something about the $1.4 trillion in unfunded federal pension liabilities on the books. But the House of Representatives was busy with other business at the time--such as voting itself a controversial pay hike that would later be remembered for its explosive impact on pension costs. Retiring in 1991, a typical congressman looked forward to $1,098,735 in lifetime benefits; by 1993 the figure had risen to $1,523,263.<P>
Finally, there was the program originally designed to offer all Americans what President Franklin Roosevelt's brain trusters called "a floor of protection" against destitution in old age. But over the course of more than half a century Social Security had evolved into something radically different. By 1991 the system was distributing more than 555 billion a year, or more than a fifth of its benefits, to households with incomes above $50,000 a year. For that much money the government could have provided every American with cradle-to-grave insurance against poverty
-including the one American child in twenty who lived in a household reporting a cash income during 1991 of less than $5,000.<P>
For many years the worsening inefficiency and inequity of the U.S. social
welfare system seemed to make little impression on American political opinion. Political leaders as diverse as Newt Gingrich, George Bush, Bill Clinton, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan expressed alarm at the moral hazard of providing welfare benefits to poor unwed mothers. But few political leaders worried about the moral hazard--and incomparably larger cost--of subsidizing home-equity loans for rising young stockbrokers, granting free medical care, PX cards, and half pay for life to ex-colonels at age forty
two, passing out farm payments to affluent agribusiness owners, or writing checks to globetrotting senior citizens which got forwarded to Bermuda. It was convenient to assume that free lunches corrupted only the underclass.<P>
As the 1990-1992 recession lingered, forcing local governments to cut teachers' pay, ignore the raving homeless, and fence off sagging bridges, state governors turned to Washington, where politicians shrugged their shoulders and pointed to a budget bursting with entitlement programs running on auto pilot. Meanwhile, ordinary Americans wondered what was happening to their nation's public sector. It could afford neither to build for the future nor to care for the needy--despite unprecedented borrowing, a near-record level of taxation, and sinking defense outlays that by the fall of 1992 had reached their lowest share of GNP since Harry Truman ran for President. With the vaunted post-Cold War Peace dividend" evaporating, the United States found itself unable to invest adequately in either its infrastructure or its children. Eventually people began to talk of another Great Depression, before the coming of the next New Deal.<P>
<BR>
<b>A Welfare State for the Affluent</b><P>
Rudolf Goldscheid, the socialist economist, once observed, "The budget is the skeleton of the state stripped of all misleading ideologies." By now federal entitlement spending has become so pervasive in American life-
not just among the poor but most notably among the middle class and the affluent--that one cannot make sense of our politics or the condition of our economy without considering how this spending rearranges the nation's resources and defines our choices as a society.<P>
Ever since the early 1980s, when the United States lost control of its fiscal policy, the term "entitlements"--referring to all federal benefit payments to individuals--has been part of the American political lexicon. Today the twelve-digit numbers that first worried budget experts back in the late 1970s look positively quaint--although events have proved that the growth of entitlements is indeed the leading cause of the nation's long-term structural deficits. This year the cost of federal benefits is larger than was the entire federal budget when Ronald Reagan arrived in Washington with a mandate to slash the welfare state.<P>
All told, entitlements have become a trillion-dollar river. The main current includes more than $700 billion in direct outlays, received by at least one member of roughly half the nation's households. These expenditures account for more than 45 percent of all federal spending, and are more than twice as large as the amount consumed by defense. Another flow of nearly $200 billion is distributed in the form of tax subsidies to individuals, such as the home-mortgage deduction and the exclusion for employer-paid health care. These explicit breaks in the tax code are the moral and fiscal equivalent of the government's simply mailing a check. To pay for them, other people's taxes have to be raised, other benefits have to be cut, or the deficit has to be increased.<P>
The accumulating burden is not about to ease. Our economy shows no sign of "outgrowing" the cost of entitlements, as many partisans of Reaganomics, along with many liberals, once hoped. Though the relative cost typically rises and falls with the business cycle, it has always emerged from each new recession larger than it emerged from the last. In fiscal year 1992 federal benefit outlays alone u ill exceed 12 percent of GNP, the second highest level ever. Including tax benefits, the total cost of federal entitlements amounts to well over 15 percent of GNP, and Congress now projects that it will climb steadily through the late 1990s. For the first time, the economy should not expect any post-recession relief.<P>
Who benefits from this spending? Until recently no one really knew. Budget experts, to be sure, have always pointed to a few eyebrow-raising numbers. Consider the fact that of all federal benefit outlays, only a quarter flows through programs that require any evidence of financial need--and that even this "means-tested" quarter includes such middle
class staples as student loans and VA hospital care. Consider also that only one of every eight federal benefit dollars actually reaches Americans in poverty. But reliable income figures for all recipient households have simply not been available. Cash-income surveys conducted by the Census Bureau are plagued by high rates of underreporting (especially by the wealthy). Tax-return data from the Internal Revenue Service are more accurate, but do not cover the entire population (especially the poor).<P>
Several years ago, however, growing curiosity on Capitol Hill persuaded the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to try to unravel the mystery. By merging the Census and IRS data sources, CBO economists ultimately arrived at reliable and comprehensive estimates of benefits by household income. The estimates were circulated behind closed doors during the 1990 budget summit and have since been updated-- though they have never yet been published. The benefit income statistics we cite throughout this article are based on these CBO estimates, which cover about 80 percent of all federal benefit outlays.<P>
These numbers destroy any ideological myths Americans may cling to about who gets what from government. They offer an accurate glimpse of that "skeleton of the state"--which has too long been locked in the political closet.<P>
The CBO research demonstrates, in fact, that the most affluent Americans actually collect slightly more from the welfare state than do the poorest Americans. It shows that last year U.S. households with incomes over $100,000 received, on average, $5,690 worth of federal cash and in-kind benefits, while the corresponding figure for U.S. households with incomes under $10,000 was $5,560. Quite simply, if the federal government wanted to flatten the nation's income distribution, it would do better to mail all its checks to random addresses. The problem is not that poverty programs don't target the poor. More than 85 percent of the benefits from AFDC, SSI, and food stamps do indeed go to households with incomes under $20,000. But their impact is neutralized by all the other programs, which tilt the other way and are, of course, much greater in size.<P>
The trend over time is also unsettling. Liberals sometimes attribute the growing disparity of income in America to Reagan-era cuts in targeted poverty programs. Among the very poorest households that is indeed one cause. From 1980 to 1991, in consent dollars, the average federal benefit received by households with incomes under $10,000 declined by seven percent. Yet liberals typically overlook the gentrification of America's untargeted nonpoverty programs, which has been pushing even more powerfully to widen the gap between rich and poor. During those same eleven years, among households with incomes over $200,000 the real value of average benefits received (mostly Social Security, Medicare, and federal pensions) fully doubled.<P>
But thus far we have been considering only direct outlays. When we include the value of entitlements conveyed through the tax code, the bias in favor of the well-off becomes even more pronounced.<P>
<BR>
<b>Tax Expenditures and Other Subsidies</b><P>
Such tax subsidies date back to 1918, when patriotic fervor for U.S. troops in Europe was running high. Political leaders in Washington felt they should do something dramatic to reward the doughboys. Facing a tight budget, Congress hesitated to raise veterans' benefits directly. But then someone on Capitol Hill took a look at the five-year-old federal income
tax system and came up with a nifty idea: Why not "raise" veterans' benefits simply by exempting such benefits from the tax?<P>
Over the years many more "tax expenditures" have followed, nearly all of them--like the first--created entirely off budget, without estimating eventual cost and far from the scrutiny that normally accompanies direct appropriations. Several, including the exemptions for Social Security benefits and for employer-paid health care, were created not by Congress but by offhand IRS rulings in the 1930s and 1940s. At the time, no one paid them much notice, because tax rates were low, Social Security benefits were modest, and company health plans were rare. But in fiscal year 1992 these two rulings alone are costing the federal government nearly $90 billion, which is more than the Pentagon's total budget for weapons procurement.<P>
Though tax expenditures as a political art were invented during the First World War, the term itself dates back only to the mid-1960s, when it was coined by Stanley S. Surrey, a Harvard Law don who served as assistant secretary of the Treasury for Ox policy in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations. In the course of his battles with Congress over tax policy, Surrey was struck by the fact that Congress w as increasingly using selective tax reductions for specific groups of people, rather than direct appropriations, as a means of distributing public resources.<P>
Surrey's favorite example was the deduction for medical expenses. He explained that this tax provision had precisely the same impact, both on the budget and on the public, as a multibillion-dollar benefit program that heavily favored the very rich (because they pay taxes at the highest rates) and that entirely excluded the very poor (because they don't pay Axes at all). There was indeed only one big difference: the same Congress that created the tax provision would never dare to create the benefit program.<P>
Although the tax-expenditure concept has been widely accepted by economists over the past thirty years, it strikes many Americans the wrong way. A common complaint is that the concept somehow assumes that government "owns" all your income before doing you the favor of letting you keep part of it. This is not the case. The concept simply assumes that each person owes the government according to a general rate schedule superimposed on every person's ability to pay. Whatever violates such equal treatment is deemed the equivalent of a benefit outlay--the same, that is, as a check in the mail.<P>
From the dogmatic insistence that there is no such thing as a tax expenditure, any number of absurdities must follow: for instance, that a public policy exempting all circus clowns from paying income taxes would not be a public benefit to circus clowns--who would simply be keeping more of "their own" money. Who cares if keeping more of "their" money means taking more of someone else's? Or if it means bankrupting everyone's kids? The ultimate thrust of this line of reasoning is to deny that a society can consent to and act upon any equitable principle of public sacrifice. Accordingly, all taxation is inherently unjust, and though cheating on your taxes may be legally wrong, it cannot be morally wrong.<P>
It is no surprise that many well-off Americans, uneasy about their nation's loss of fiscal discipline, find consolation in this pugnacious illogic. What is surprising is to hear conservatives leading the chorus. Back in the early 1970s, strange to say, many of these same intellectuals pushed Nixon's ill-fated "negative income Ox," the very premise of which is that less tax is the precise equivalent of more income. But during the 1980s they have become the preachers of a selective civic virtue-
austerity for targeted benefits to the poor and indulgence toward shotgun tax favors to the affluent.<P>
Today, even though the government publishes estimates of the cost of different tax expenditures, this form of spending still attracts comparatively little attention. But by now the numbers involved, and their social and economic effects, are too large to ignore. Honest people can and do differ over what constitutes a genuine tax expenditure, as opposed to "equitable" treatment--say, for investment income or charitable donations. According to some, ability to pay should be measured by what a person earns; according to others, by what a person consumes. But even if we confine our list of tax expenditures to those that contradict any principle of ability to pay--that is, to those that nearly all economists can agree on--the total fiscal cost comes to at least $170 billion. Those tax expenditures arbitrarily reward millions of lucky people for such endeavors as financing a built-in sauna, hiring an au pair, or getting the boss to pay for the therapist.<P>
<P>


This spending is regressive in the strictest sense of the word. Even when poorer households qualify for these benefits (and often they do not), what they receive is smaller, relative to their income, than what goes to the affluent. According to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, for example, last year the average value of the mortgage-interest deduction for taxpayers with incomes over $100,000 was $3,469. In contrast, the same deduction was worth an average of only $516 for taxpayers in the $20,000 to $30,000 bracket who qualified to take the benefit--and of course many, including renters and those who opted for the standard deduction, did not.<P>
When we add together all the tax expenditures and all the direct outlays for which we have 1991 income data-- and this is about 80 percent of each type of entitlement--an unambiguous picture emerges. On average, households with incomes under $10,000 collected a total of $5,690 in benefits. On average, households with incomes over $100,000 collected $9,280. In terms of total fiscal cost, moreover, the aggregate amounts received by the non-needy in 1991 were staggering. One half (at least $400 billion) of all entitlements went to households with incomes over $30,000. One quarter (at least $200 billion) went to households with incomes over $50,000. These are the facts--regardless of what our political folktales might say.<P>
How did our entitlement system wind up delivering most of its benefits to people who are clearly not in need? Obviously, the overall spending pattern does not conform to any master plan. Congress never passed a "Comprehensive Welfare for the Well-Off Act." Rather, the system we see today is the inadvertent legacy of thousands of why-not-please-everybody votes on Capitol Hill--together with economic and demographic trends that no one anticipated.<P>
Nor does any conspiracy lie behind the way Americans have chosen over the past decade to finance the growth of entitlements. They have done so through deficit spending--the result of a persistent ideological deadlock between cutting spending and raising taxes. Each side, unfortunately, has reason to regret the outcome. On the one hand, those who prevented significant reform in the welfare state have worsened any prevailing trend toward inequity by income and class. On the other hand, those who urged that it is better to finance the welfare state through debt than through taxes have burdened Americans with a new layer of inequity by age and generation.<P>
These are the conditions leading to the coming of the next New Deal--a new deal that is needed to restore both fairness and efficiency to our trillion-dollar entitlement budget. The U.S. social-welfare system has by now come to resemble a ramshackle mansion on a hill, with squeaky back stairways and barren hallways leading to musty, sealed-off chambers.<P>
Open this door and behold the federal railroad retirement system--a Christmas gift from Congress to the railroad industry in 1935, still chugging after all these years, at an annual cost of $7.8 billion. That crowing in the pantry is the sound of $50,000, on average, in direct federal payments being snatched up by each of the 30,000 biggest
grossing farmers in America. Not one of them looks like Pa Joad. And down this hall you'll find the bonanza-baby nursery, filled with Americans born from 1910 through 1916, whose Social Security benefit levels are higher than those of anyone born before or after. Can anyone remember why? What about that thumping noise? Maybe it's the so-called one percent "kicker" from the 1970s, which still inflates civil-service pensions.<P>
This is a structure, leaky and drafty and wildly expensive to heat, that was tolerably suited to its previous owners but now requires radical remodeling. What would FDR, architect of the original New Deal, have said if he had learned that by 1991 a fifth of American children would be living in poverty--still ill housed and ill nourished--while a fifth of the dollars spent by major federal benefit programs went to households earning $50,000 or more?<P>
Fortunately, the system can be made to work again. But before the next New Deal can happen, Americans will have to start viewing entitlements as a whole, and debating comprehensive reforms.<P>
<BR>
<b>Welfare for the Well Off</b><P>
Even if our current entitlement system were sustainable well into the twenty-first century--and it is not--most Americans would still have good reason to demand a new deal. Consider how little we as a nation are getting back for the money we are spending: no national health insurance plan, no maternity benefits or family allowances such as are available in Germany and France, no guarantee against falling into poverty or even becoming homeless-- in old age or at any other time of life.<P>
In 1990, for example, the federal government handed out an average of $11,400 worth of benefits to every American aged sixty-five or over-
more than ten times what it gave to each child--yet 3.7 million senior citizens still languished below the poverty line. Many of the latter receive a "means-tested" benefit-- Supplemental Security Income. But for an elderly person living alone in 1990 the federal SSI program offered a maximum cash benefit of 74 percent of the poverty level, or $4,632 annually. That same year, while 18 million Americans earning less than $15,000 at full-time, year-round jobs "contributed" their FICA dollars, a CEO and spouse could retire and expect to receive more than $24,000 annually in tax-sheltered Social Security and Medicare benefits, in addition to their corporate pension and "medigap" plan, and sundry forms of private investment income.<P>
Why doesn't the welfare state do a better job of actually insuring against poverty? The bottom-line reason is that we divert too many resources to the affluent.<P>
The most stunning illustrations of welfare for the well-off come in the form of entitlements conveyed through the tax code. Consider, for example, the exclusion from taxation of most Social Security income along with the insurance value of Medicare benefits, which together cost the Treasury about $34 billion last year. The households that receive the largest favor are those with the most income. In fact both these tax expenditures may be regarded as especially insidious forms of back-door spending, since they simply add to the already top-heavy distribution of Social Security and Medicare benefits. For the 37 percent of senior citizens who regularly vacation abroad, these tax subsidies are enough to pay for a few extra days of shopping in tropical ports of call. But they do little for another 40 percent of senior citizens who owe no tax on their Form 1040 because they aren't as well off. This is why every other major industrial nation regards all or nearly all of its social-insurance benefits as taxable income.<P>
The same point applies to the child-care credit which cost the government more than $3 billion last year. Households with incomes below $10,000 received virtually no benefit from this tax subsidy. Those with incomes above $50,000, however, received $1.2 billion to help pay for nannies and other child-care expenses.<P>
For the really big bucks, take a look at the exclusion for employer-paid health care. Under this provision, those Americans fortunate enough to receives health-care insurance from their employers are allowed to exclude the value of their insurance from both income and payroll taxation. Last year this single tax expenditure cost the U.S. Treasury $60 billion in forgone revenue.<P>
Who benefited? Obviously, no one among the 35 million people not covered by any form of health insurance or among the 32 million people who pay for their plans out of their own pockets. These 67 million Americans are twice as likely to live in poverty as are all other Americans. But that is only part of the inequity. Among households that were covered by employer-paid health-care plans, the average benefit for those in the highest income brackets was many times larger than the average for those in the lowest income brackets. Moreover, most economists agree that such large subsidies encourage their beneficiaries to overconsume health-care services, and thus put even more inflationary pressure on a system already in crisis. Who will argue with an employer who offers a Gold Plan" package that provides generous coverage for every medical contingency, from orthodontia to nose jobs to psychoanalysis, as long as it's tax-free?<P>
It is much the same story with most other entitlements conveyed through the tax code. Not only are they inequitable in their distribution of benefits but also they contribute to gross distortions in how the U.S. economy allocates resources. In addition to overconsuming health care, for example, affluent Americans tend to overconsume powder rooms and swimming pools and vacation homes at the expense of more-productive investments--thanks to the mortgage deduction and other tax subsidies for owner-occupied real estate. One result of all these tax favors: the hospitals and homes of Grosse Point and other affluent suburbs of Detroit are far more luxurious than any to be found in, say, the suburbs of Yokohama or Stuttgart. But only in Detroit do the suburbs surround a burned-out, deindustrializing core. Not coincidentally, every major industrial society except the United States pays for little (or none) of its health care with tax-sheltered insurance, and tightly restricts (or prohibits) any deductions for interest on home mortgages.<P>
To the rule that says most tax subsidies go to the wealthy, there is one exception: the Earned Income Tax Credit. First enacted in 1975, the EITC is the closest America has ever come to a negative income tax. But its effect on the overall picture is negligible. Even after including the EITC with all the other tax expenditures mentioned above, the bottom line is still that the rich receive by far the largest benefits.<P>
Households with incomes below $10,000, for example, receive an average of $131 a year from all these tax-subsidy programs combined. Middle
class households do better: those with incomes in the $30,000 to $50,000 range receive tax benefits averaging $1,483. But it is the truly affluent who receive the greatest subsidy: the average benefit for households with incomes over $100,000 is $3,595 a year, or nearly thirty times what goes to households most in need.<P>
<BR>
<b>The Weight of Reality Upon Ideology</b><P>
Why have Americas put up for so long with such flagrant malfunctioning of their social-welfare system? Part of the explanation must lie in today's political culture, which by the standards of FDR's crusading generation has remained exceptionally cautious in its thinking about the major institutions of the welfare state, and preoccupied with mere process issues. Meanwhile, as the decades have passed, the earth has been slowly shifting beneath the major monuments of the first New Deal. The old assumptions will not hold.<P>
When Social Security first started paying out benefits, for example, the elderly were by far the most destitute age group in American society. As recently as 1969,25 percent of American elderly were officially designated "poor"--as were only 14 percent of children under age eighteen. Today the relative positions of the very old and the very young are just about reversed: in 1990, 12 percent of the elderly and 21 percent of children were poor. Other indicators, such as noncash income, financial assets, and homeownership rates, also show that the typical elderly household is now considerably better off than the typical young family. At the same time, as we have seen, millions of the elderly continue to live in poverty. And yet Social Security continues to distribute none of its benefits on the basis of need.<P>
We live in a world radically different from that of FDR's generation. How touching it is for the historian to read that New Deal planners once projected that Social Security's survivors' and unemployment benefits would steadily reduce means-tested family assistance. The assumption, of course, was that widows were the only single mothers struggling to raise children. That 13 million children would be living with single nonwidowed mothers in 1990 was simply unthinkable. And how maddening it is for today's married woman to learn that she won't receive Social Security benefits based on her earnings unless she makes at least half her husband's salary throughout her working life. It should come as no surprise that a social welfare system designed to serve the America of Benny Goodman and Norman Rockwell now stands in need of serious structural repair.<P>
We also live in a world radically different from that of the Johnson and Nixon presidencies, when the steepest increases in entitlement spending took place. In that era renowned economists wrote books about the "challenge of abundance" and testified before Congress about how Americans would soon enjoy a twenty-two-hour workweek. In 1972, on the eve of Social Security's largest single benefit hike, the system's actuaries projected that henceforth real U.S. wages would forever rise at the rate of 56 percent every two decades--an assumption that made almost anything affordable. Looking back, that sort of economic euphoria seems as dated as 2001:A Space Odyssey. What has in fact happened over the twenty years since 1972 is that real wages, as defined by the actuaries, have grown by hardly more than four percent. Polls indicate that most Americans are no longer confident that today's children will do as well economically as their parents--and indeed they will not, unless the country frees up the resources it needs to undertake wide-scale investments m improving productivity. Sixty years after the New Deal there is virtually no connection between the pattern of entitlement spending and any coherent public purpose. So why is reform so often regarded as impossible?<P>
Part of the reason is ideological. Throughout the Reagan years the allure of supply-side economics persuaded many conservatives that reforming entitlements was no longer necessary; with tax cuts and deregulation, the nation could simply "outgrow" them. The party that once fought losing battles against the New Deal could thereby dish the Whigs and painlessly rid itself of its plutocratic reputation. Liberals, meanwhile, have been slow to grasp how an ideal that was once taken as the nation's highest expression of community has evolved into a system that serves the interests of economic royalists at the expense of the common man.<P>
Today reality is gradually wearing away these ideological misconceptions. Still, the reform of any single entitlement program is blocked by highly organized special-interest groups, from the graypower and pension lobbies to the agribusiness, construction, and health-care industries. Even affluent beneficiaries who may be uncomfortable accepting government money don't like feeling singled out for sacrifice. The Palm Beach retiree, for example, won't go along with higher taxes on his Social Security benefits just so that the yuppie down the street can get another tax break.<P>
What is needed is a comprehensive approach to entitlement reform--one that cuts not only direct spending but also tax expenditures for the well
off. In this way entitlement reform could avoid becoming a contest between generations. By putting every form of government spending on the table, America could also end that long-running, sterile debate between those who want to cut spending and those who want to cut taxes. Genuine reform could at last be what it should be: a more equitable and productive redirection of the nation's limited resources.<P>
<BR>
<b>The Peace Dividend Is Not Enough</b><P>
But couldn't we get by, many readers will ask with just staying the course? Won't the end of the Cold War free up enough resources so that we won't need to take on entitlement reform?<P>
The short answer is no. A world at peace won't be enough to right the nation's fiscal imbalance.<P>
As we mentioned earlier, benefit outlays accounted for 45 percent of all federal spending in calendar year 1991. Yet this conventional measure of the cost of entitlements, large as it is, underestimates their practical importance. First, it includes only the benefits themselves, not the cost of administering them. Add on a minimal five percent overhead, and the total rises to 48 percent of the budget. Second, a fair measure would compare entitlements only with other types of spending that are adjustable, not with spending that is entirely beyond anyone's control. So let's subtract net interest payments on the national debt ($199.4 billion) and last year's payments on the S&L bailout ($101.8 billion). Both are obligations that must be met in order to avoid a devastating financial panic. Now the total rises to 60 percent of the budget. Finally, let's figure in the $170 billion in benefit-like tax expenditures. This pushes the total up to just over 65 percent of the budget.<P>
The bottom line might be summarized this way: Entitlements, defined as the full cost of both direct and taxcode benefits, amount to two thirds of the federal spending over which government has some control.<P>
A large part of the remaining third is defense spending. The cuts now scheduled will help, but alone they are clearly insufficient. Consider that even eliminating the entire blaring Corps would not defray the annual cost of military pensions. In fact, even if the Department of Defense were abolished and all the armed forces disbanded, the U.S. Treasury would still not be able to pay this year's bills without borrowing. As for the small corner of the budget still dedicated to "discretionary" civilian projects-
everything from running parks, regulating polluters, and sheltering runaway children to building highways, testing superconductors, and arresting drug traffickers--as a share of GNP that corner has been smaller since the late 1980s than at any other time since the late 1950s. It is unlikely that Americans could achieve major savings in this catchall budget area without curtailing some of the vital core services they expect from government. Most policy discussions instead favor more of this type of spending, which no doubt would already be larger today were it not perpetually crowded out by the metastasizing of universal benefits.<P>

Another question, still sometimes heard in post-Reagan America, is "Why reform entitlements or even worry about the deficit when we can always just raise taxes?" But the answer is clear enough: The revenue option won't work because it won't happen. One can find many polls showing that most Americans favor the concept of a means test for benefits. But one cannot find any poll showing that more than a small minority of Americans favor a large, general-purpose tax hike.<P>
This anti-tax sentiment is linked to widespread cynicism about government, especially the federal government, which should make many liberals think twice before dismissing entitlement reform. Quite simply, those who want more taxes and bigger budgets must first demonstrate that government can apply commonsense priorities to the money it is already spending. Anyone waiting for public attitudes to change spontaneously should take a closer look at America's rising generation of voters under thirty--not just at their Republican sympathies, which incline them against taxes anyway, but at their intense distrust of unkeepable promises, breakable chain letters, and crocodile tears. What the typical new voter most distrusts, in short, is just the sort of rhetoric that still enshrouds our welfare state.<P>
<BR>
<b>Unfavorable Demographics</b><P>
Each decade since the first New Deal, from the 1930s through the 1980s, entitlement spending has grown faster than the economy. Under our current system it is certain to do so in future decades as well, especially once the oldest members of the enormous postwar Baby Boom generation begin reaching retirement age, just sixteen years from now. Today more than 60 percent of all federal benefit spending flows to the 12 percent of Americans who are age sixty-five or older. As long as the welfare state allocates most benefits on the basis of seniority alone, the cost will grow geometrically as the size of the elderly population increases. In combination with the aging of the population, improvements in medical technology will likely cause per capita health care costs to continue growing several times as fast as per-worker GNP.<P>
Demographic data easily numb the mind, but one can gain an intuitive sense of what all this means for government spending by considering just how favorable demographic trends have been for the United States in recent years. During the 1980s the 76 million members of the Baby Boom generation moved into their prime productive years--old enough to have mastered job skills but too young to retire. The result was an automatic surge in federal revenue--especially since the women of this generation have been far more likely than their mothers to work for wages, and therefore to contribute taxes.<P>
Meanwhile, demographics have also been favorable to the spending side of the budget. The growth rate of the retirement-age population has actually been slowing down since the mid-1980s, owing to the declining birth rates of the late 1920s. Yet the United States is still running enormous budget deficits. What will happen when these favorable demographic trends turn into unfavorable trends, beginning around 2010?<P>
Since 1960, federal benefit outlays alone have grown from roughly five percent to 12 percent of GNP. No one knows, of course, what the future may bring. But if one adopts the economic, demographic, and medical assumptions used by the Social Security Administration and the Health Care Financing Administration. the total cost will rise much further over the next fifty years, perhaps to 71 percent of GNP (best case) or to 30 percent of GNP (most plausible case). And this assumes not a single new program or eligibility provision. Outlays of this magnitude would threaten to crowd out not only all forms of public and private investment but also any hope that government might respond to new social needs. Ultimately, even huge tax hikes would merely cover the growing cost of programs whose original intentions had long been forgotten.<P>
Well before we reach such nightmare fiscal scenarios, moreover, the income inequity of the U.S. welfare state will become painfully obvious. Look ahead to the year 2000, when today's unusually affluent Americans in their fifties begin to retire. This is a cohort of lifelong upward mobility whose average household wealth in retirement (according to the economists Frank Levy and Richard Michel) is likely to exceed that of all living Americans born either before or after them. Then consider the position of today's young adults-- handicapped by unstable family backgrounds, an inferior education, and stagnating entry-level wages. By the year 2000, while raising families amid growing talk of yet another hike in the payroll tax, they will cast searching eyes at the abundance of their elders. In her recent book Social Insecurity the former Social Security commissioner Dorcas Hardy does not hesitate to link the issues of age, income, and race. "As we move into the next century," she asks, "will the minorities of this country--immigrants and otherwise-- come to see the Social Security system as a mechanism by which the government robs their children of a better future, in order to support a group of elderly white people in a retirement that is both too luxurious and too long?"<P>
Take it from someone who once ran the system: the entitlement crisis is not about to go away if we just ignore it.<P>
<BR>
<b>A Comprehensive Reform</b><P>
Overhauling the O.S. welfare state so that it serves our national goals will entail enormous changes, most likely including a wholesale restructuring of the U.S. health care system. But in the meantime we Americans can make federal entitlements much more equitable and free up the resources we need to cut our fiscal deficits and boost our national savings, by acting on a simple if far-reaching principle. The principle is that one's benefits should be proportional to one's need--whether the subsidy comes in the form of health insurance or a farm subsidy or a mortgage-interest deduction or a Social Security check.<P>
How might such a principle be applied to the existing welfare state and how much money would it save? Any reform package should satisfy the three most common objections to a cost-control effort. First, it should not reduce the income of any household that is anywhere near the poverty line. More precisely the half of all U.S. households that report incomes over $30,000 should be asked to bear nearly all the extra burden.<P>
Second, any reform package should adjust benefits according to a graduated scale, so that middle- and upper-income households do not become net losers just because they happen to rise a few dollars above a certain threshold. Nor should earning a high income become a disqualification for receiving any subsidy. To preserve the universal character of our major entitlement programs, members of every household, regardless of income, should still stand to gain some benefits, albeit in proportion to their needs.<P>
Third, any comprehensive reform must take into account the quasi
contractual nature of at least some entitlement programs. This last proviso is the toughest to accommodate, but not as tough as is sometimes thought.<P>
Strongly rooted in American political folklore, for example, is the idea that Social Security recipients are only "getting their money back," that Social Security is an "inviolable contract," and so forth. But such claims have no financial or even legal basis, however much certain politicians and interest groups may claim otherwise. True enough, the original Social Security Act of 1935 included a "money back" guarantee (with some interest) on all employee contributions, and called for benefit levels to be calculated on the basis of the lifetime covered wages earned by each individual. But the guarantee was eliminated by Congress in 1939, and the link between benefit levels and years of participation, after being weakened in 1939, was entirely discarded in 1950.<P>
Ever since, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that no covered worker retains any right, contractual or otherwise, over taxes paid into the system. In fact, the Social Security Administration keeps no direct records of how much each person contributes. It just keeps records of each person's wage history, to which a politically determined benefit formula is applied when that person retires. Today's retirees, as it happens, receive benefits north two to ten times what they would have earned had they invested all their lifetime Social Security taxes (both their own and their employer's) in Treasury bonds. Meanwhile, largely because of the very steep increases in Social Security taxes in recent years. most economists agree that under current law Social Security will not offer large categories of younger participants anything approaching a fair market return on what they paid into the system.<P>
So there is no reason that Social Security benefits for the well-off cannot be reduced if a majority of Americans decide that their collective resources should be used for different purposes. The same is true for civil-service and military pensions, although here the case is much stronger that an implied contract exists between well-off pensioners and the government.<P>
Before the 1970s federal employees worked for lower wages than their counterparts in the private sector. One reason they did so was the expectation of receiving government pensions far more generous than any offered by private-sector employers. Even today, no private pension offers benefits at such an early age, at such a high percentage of pay, with such lenient provisions for disability, or with such generous indexing. Moreover, because these government pension programs were never funded on an actuarially sound basis, current taxpayers are now unjustly stuck with a huge tab for yesterday's unwise policy.<P>
Still, these benefits are part of the compensation that was promised at the time--a distinction that makes a moral if not a legal difference and ought to limit benefit reductions even to the most affluent federal pensioner.<P>
Applying our simple principle would not require a big new bureaucracy. All means-testing could be achieved exclusively through tax returns, much as we now handle the limited taxation of Social Security for households with adjusted gross incomes over $25,000. Each filer would be required to enter all benefits received, which could be checked against federal records. Above certain limits the total would trigger a "benefit
withholding" liability, which the filer would send back to the IRS along with any outstanding income-tax liability. As a practical matter, federal benefits could be withheld just as wages are withheld, based on a tax filer's previous experience.<P>
How would benefit-withholding rates be set? Here are a few illustrative options, with estimates of how much money they would have saved in calendar year 1991 alone. For all cash and in-kind entitlement programs except federal employee pension plans: Withhold 7.5 percent of any benefits that cause total household income to exceed $30,000, and withhold an additional five percent at the margin for each additional $10,000 in household income. The maximum reduction of benefits would be 85 percent, applicable to households with incomes of $190,000 or more. Total savings: $33.5 billion.<P>
For civil-service and military pensions: Same as above, but with a much lower maximum withholding rate, in deference to the quasi-contractual nature of these benefits. The maximum reduction of benefits would be 25 percent, for households earning $70,000 a year or more. Total savings: $7.6 billion. <P>
For all major entitlement benefits conveyed through the tax code except benefit exclusions: Limit the amount of such tax expenditures received by upper income households to the average expenditure per household within the $30,000 to $50,000 bracket. In 1991, for example, this would have limited the total allowable mortgage interest deduction to roughly $2,500. Total savings: $34.7 billion.<P>
For benefit tax exclusions: Get rid of all income thresholds and make Social Security just as taxable as any other cash income--except for 15 percent of pro reform benefits. This untouched residual will offer, to even the wealthiest of today's retirees, at least a five percent tax-free return on all contributions they have personally paid into the system. Also, for households with incomes from $30,000 to $50,000, phase out half of the tax exclusion on the insurance value of Medicare (net of Medicare Part B premiums). Total savings: $16.9 billion.<P>
Altogether, these provisions, if they had been in place in 1991, would have freed up $93 billion in the federal budget. To be sure, no one would advocate instituting all of them in one year, especially in a bad recession year. But imagine that they were phased in over four years--starting, say, in 1993. Assuming that income brackets were adjusted for inflation, and using official budget and revenue projections, total annual savings would rise to $149 billion by 1996. That would be enough to ensure that the next recovery is a genuine investment-led expansion, not another borrow-and
consume bacchanalia.<P>
The budget savings could be considerably higher. The figures noted here reflect only about 80 percent of all federal entitlements and tax expenditures, those for which income distributions are known. The extra 20 percent included, total budget savings in 1996 could rise to more than $186 billion. Furthermore, trimming subsidies to the affluent reduces their incentive to take advantage of available benefits. Thus, to the extent that it would prompt middle- and upper-income Americans to forgo benefits altogether--for example, by retiring later, or by opting for less tax-sheltered health insurance and housing--the measure would clearly save taxpayers more than the amount a static calculation would indicate.<P>
Because all the savings would be collected through the tax code, a single piece of legislation, falling under the jurisdiction of the tax committee in each house, would be sufficient to implement the reform. Imagine doing the same job by amending every benefits statute: the process would snake through dozens of committees, grind on for years if not decades, and ultimately be undone by interest groups.<P>
This approach also has the virtue of treating all Americans fairly, according to their individual circumstances, unlike most other reform proposals--for example, limiting all cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). Even a COLA freeze that discriminated against large monthly benefits would lead to obvious inequities. For a widow receiving no income other than one large Social Security check, a COLA may be essential to keep food on the table. For a triple-dipping federal pensioner receiving the minimum Social Security benefit, that same COLA may be just enough to cover the annual rise in greens fees at the club. An income-based approach takes account of the difference. Unlike most government agencies, moreover, the Internal Revenue Service is well trained in tracking dollars no matter how far they Gavel. Even the farm subsidy that filters down through five partnerships before appearing as personal income will have to show up, earmarked, on someone's Form 1040.<P>
Politically, this approach balances the sacrifices asked of elderly and working-age Americans, without raising tax rates and without burdening the poor or even most of the middle class. Moreover, the plan would reduce specific programs in rough proportion to their overall size in the budget. Roughly half the savings would come from Social Security and Medicare and the related taxation of benefits. An additional 40 percent would come from other programs and tax expenditures, especially employer paid health care and mortgage interest. Another eight to nine percent would come from federal pensions.<P>
Would such a reform in and of itself constitute another New Deal? Hardly. The measures it would comprise are, however, the essential preconditions for the next New Deal. Without them the United States will simply see more and more of its options as a nation crowded out by the compounding costs of our subsidies to the well-off.<P>
As always, every area of federal spending should be scrutinized. Missionless bombers must be cut. Porkbarrel waterways must be eliminated. Welfare programs targeting the poor must undergo further changes, to require the able-bodied to work and to reduce the cycle of dependency. But none of these areas is where the big money is, and it is not by reforming them that the United States will free up the resources it needs to build a more just and productive society in the next century.<P>
Whatever one's vision of that new society--whether it includes a national health service or means-tested health vouchers, a negative income tax or a 15 percent flat tax, green cars running on hydrogen or mag-lev trains humming from city to city--to get something new, one must give up something old. A society that cannot find the resources to pay for sixty
cent tuberculosis vaccinations for ten-year-olds must ask itself why it is 
offering subsidized health care and housing to millionaires. Call it a 
rendezvous with destiny.<P>

Wade is on a collision coursewith itself." Justice O'Connor was referring to medical advances since 1973that make it easier both to destroy potential life and to preserve it. Hermeaning is vividly illustrated by those rare but disturbing cases in which asecond- or third-trimester abortion yields a living infant, which must then beeither killed or rushed to another part of the hospital for the latest inneonatal care.<p><p><p>But Justice O'Connor could just as well have been referring to thecontradictions at the heart of contemporary feminism. Like the majority ofAmericans, I have reservations about both the pro-choice and the pro-lifeextremes. But I also feel that there is an imbalance between the degrees ofcriticism aimed at the two sides: not enough attention has been paid to thetwisted logic of pro-choice rhetoric. This essay will try to redress thatimbalance, by first sketching the course of recent feminist history and thendissecting some of the hypocrisies and contradictions used by pro-choiceadvocates to justify the absolute right to abortion.<p><p><p>Contemporary feminism began as a revolt against the traditional female role asit was experienced by the generation of college-educated women who in the 1950sattempted to make a full-time occupation of domesticity. To a large extent itwas inspired by Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique (1963), which began as asurvey of Friedan's former classmates at Smith and grew into a polemic aboutthe psychological frustrations experienced by women who exchanged therelatively egalitarian world of the college campus for the "comfortableconcentration camps" of middle-class suburbia. Restless and sometimes enviousof their husbands' careers, Friedan's "trapped housewives" wanted to pursue thebasically liberal goal of freedom and autonomy on an equal basis with men. Soona movement arose to break out of the stifling private sphere inhabited byfemales and enter the breezy public forum dominated by males.<p><p><p>But a funny thing happened on the way to the forum. Try as they would, thefeminists of the 1960s and 1970s could not extirpate the reality of genderdifferences. For the radical fringe, the persistence of such differences wasproof that female oppression was the most deeply ingrained injustice inhistory--"metaphysical cannibalism," Ti-Grace Atkinson called it. Butmainstream feminists did not feel drawn to this sisterhood, which was based onhatred for the essential experiences of womanhood. Beginning in theuniversities, many of them sought ways to accept gender differences withoutsacrificing equality.<p><p><p><p><br><p><br><b>From Equality to Superiority</b><p><p><p>These efforts at first had an unassailable logic. Objecting that theapocalyptic visions of the radicals dehumanized women as passive victims,scholars in the field of women's studies began upgrading the image oftraditional womanhood in history, literature, and the social sciences. Thepolitical philosopher Jean Bethke Elshtain describes the process this way:<p><p><p>"Another strain of feminist thought, best called 'difference feminism,'questioned the move towards full assimilation of female identity with publicmale identity and argued that to see women's traditional roles and activitiesas wholly oppressive was itself oppressive to women, denying them historicsubjectivity and moral agency."<p><p><p>For some feminists, this upgrading led to a new acceptance of domesticity. Forothers, it led to a new and more subtle radicalism, as they persuaded firstthemselves and then the university that the differences between the sexesextended to modes of thinking--not just in women's studies but in every othersubject, from aardvarks to zymology. And lest this new difference be confusedwith the old one that relegated women to mental inferiority, a number ofscholars were on hand to suggest that the female mode was superior.<p><p><p>One influential book was the psychologist Carol Gilligan's In a Different Voice(1982). Gilligan concluded, from a study of moral reasoning in both sexes, thatmen reason from public-oriented ideas of individual rights and fair play, whilewomen reason from private-oriented ideas of responsibility and caring forothers. When the book was published, some of Gilligan's Harvard colleaguesobserved that this distinction--between justice and mercy, broadlyconstrued--is as old as the Western philosophical tradition. At the same time,other scholars were reminding feminists that an idealized notion of nurturing,peaceloving womanhood was the keystone of both the nineteenth-century bourgeoisfamily and the "moral uplift" movement that spawned helping professions likesocial work.<p><p><p>But these comparisons were spurned by those academic feminists who preferred tobelieve that social science had proved the existence of a separate, and morallysuperior, female mind with a distinctive set of values. Once upon a timeuniversity women had argued that scientific reason had no gender, and thataesthetic imagination was androgynous. But no longer. It wasn't in theirinterest. Instead, they had every incentive, material and otherwise, to jointhe feminist guild and subscribe to this new strain of feminist thought--bestcalled "superiority feminism." Here feminism took an unfortunate turn, becausea sense of superiority is hard to control. It is one thing to upgrade the imageof heroines in Victorian novels, and quite another to adjust your opinion ofunliberated housewives, Bible-quoting ministers, and conservative Republicanslobbying against the Equal Rights Amendment.<p><p><p>When it comes to politics, feminists still claim today, as Friedan claimed in1963, that the frustration of the few is shared by the many. Yet even back in1963 this claim was mistaken, because the peculiarly stifling circumstancesdescribed in The Feminine Mystique simply didn't obtain for most women. Andtoday, despite a rise in female employment and a decline in family stability,there are still a great many women who spend their married lives in the samecommunity where they grew up, who don't aspire to college and career, and,perhaps most important, who don't envy their husbands' work experience. Themajority of men and women who must earn their living in ways that are notespecially stimulating or enriching still embrace the ideal (if not always thereality) of women's providing for their families what Christopher Lasch hascalled a "haven in a heartless world."<p><p><p>To sum up, in the family and the workplace feminists deny the legitimacy ofgender-based divisions of labor. "We are individuals," they intone, "and ourrole in homemaking and breadwinning must be identical to that of men." In theacademy, however, feminists deny the possibility of gender-free research. "Weare women," they intone, "and our values and thought processes are differentfrom and better than those of men. " For a long time this inconsistency showedup only when an especially ornery antifeminist--or perhaps the house-husband ofa professor of women's studies--compared the two separate spheres. But today itshows up in the heat of political debate, as pro-choice activists switch backand forth between the two kinds of feminism to defend the absolute right toabortion. Few activists take time to ponder the contradiction between afeminism that denies gender and one that institutionalizes it. Like mostpolitical actors, they use rhetoric for its persuasiveness, not its logic. Butas I hope to show in my discussion of pro-choice reasoning, doublethink is notall that persuasive.<p><p><p> <p><br><p><br><b>Who Owns Whose Flesh?</b><p><p><p>The original pro-choice argument is rooted in the classical liberal affirmationof every man's right to own his own body. Critical of liberalism for itsfailure to extend this right equally to women, pro-choicers define abortion asthe essence of every woman's right to own her own body. In Abortion &amp; ThePolitics of Motherhood, Kristin Luker's 1984 study of attitudes on both sidesof the abortion debate, one activist put it this way: "we can get all therights in the world...and none of them means a doggone thing if we don't ownthe flesh we stand in."<p><p><p>The obvious objection to this argument is that a fetus is not just part of awoman's body For a while pro-choicers tried to meet this objection bydehumanizing the fetus. Some still do. For example, Jane Hodgson, the Minnesotaphysician who is currently challenging that state's parental-notification lawbefore the Supreme Court, told The Washington Post that one way to reassure apatient after a first-trimester abortion is to show her the pan of "uterinecontents." Dr. Hodgson also refers to the object of such a procedure as "a fewembryonic cells." By using such phrases the seventy-four-year-old Hodgson isechoing the tones of an earlier era. In the face of the passionate rhetoric ofthe pro-life movement, to say nothing of public opinion, which has neverwavered in its support of tighter restrictions on later abortions (a positionthat does not deny the fetus humanity so much as assign it greater weight as itbecomes more likely to develop into a child), pro-choice activists have nothingto gain from using such clinical and dehumanizing language.<p><p><p>The more up-to-date pro-choice arguments are rooted in superiority-feminism'selevation of the "private" morality of women over the "public" morality of men.In this spirit pro-choicers define abortion as an intensely personal experiencethat no man can judge. Bella Abzug anticipated this view in 1980 when sheattacked Jimmy Carter's "'personal' objections to abortion" as "biologicallyinappropriate." With this phrase Abzug reveals the bogus logic of declaring thesubject of abortion off limits to men. Since when has biology determined thearenas in which human beings can make moral judgments?<p><p><p>In a similar vein pro-choicers define abortion as a family matter that is nobusiness of politicians'. Thus the claim, made before the Supreme Court by theAmerican Civil Liberties Unions that the Minnesota law requiring notificationof both parents in cases of teenage abortion "tramples on the integrity offamilies. " And thus Planned Parenthood's insistence that cuts in federalfunding for abortion counseling are "an outrageous assault on the Americanfamily."<p><p><p>To clarify the doublethink in such rhetoric, consider the language used by theAppellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court last year in rulingagainst two pro-life activists who tried to prevent an abortion on a comatosewoman named Nancy Klein. The abortion had been sought by Klein's husband, inconsultation with her parents and her doctor, in the hope that it wouldincrease her chances of recovery. The court said that "absolute strangers tothe Klein family, whatever their motivation, have no place in this familytragedy."<p><p>Appropriate though this language may be to the unhappy case of Nancy Klein, itis also misleading, in exactly the same way that the pro-choice activists'pro-family, anti-government rhetoric is misleading. "Absolute strangers" arenot the only people who "have no place" in abortion decisions. If Klein had notbeen in a coma, she would have been legally entitled to decide betweendestroying and preserving this unborn life without consulting either its fatheror its grandparents. All the pro-family rhetoric in the world cannot changethis blunt fact. After Roe v. Wade abortion is not a family decision. It is thedecision of one class of individuals--pregnant women--who have been designated,in Orwell's pithy phrase, "more equal than others."<p><p><p><p><br><p><br><b>The Materfamilias</b><p><p><p>Granted, there is nothing new about granting a class of people withlife-or-death power over their families. Such is the original definition ofpatriarchy. In ancient Rome, for example, a great many political, economic, andreligious powers resided in the male heads of tribes, clans, and households.Among these was the power to commit infanticide. If a newborn was deemedhealthy and supportable by the paterfamilias, it was initiated into the familywith the proper rites. If not, it was smothered or drowned.<p><p><p>In Rome infanticide was not considered murder, any more than abortion isconsidered murder by the majority of Americans today. But the Romans regardedinfanticide as a very grave act, which is why it could be performed only by thepaterfamilias. In the sense that our present abortion law vests the pregnantwoman with the power to commit a similarly grave act, it's tempting to dub herthe "materfamilias." But of course she is nothing of the kind. The stern powersof the paterfamilias were fused with stern duties, such as atoning for crimescommitted by the members of his household. In the organic metaphor we'veinherited from the Romans (by way of Christian views of natural law), the"members" and the "heads" of families and other social institutions are boundby ties so powerful that they can be severed only by a kind of amputation.<p><p><p>Since the seventeenth century this organic metaphor has been challenged byliberalism's depiction of social institutions not as organisms made up ofconsanguine parts but as contractual arrangements between consentingindividuals. The feminists' complaint against liberalism is that it has never,despite its contractual ethos, stopped conceiving of the family as an organicinstitution. As the political philosopher Susan Moller Okin has put it,liberalism still takes a "prescriptive view of woman's nature and proper modeof life based on her role and functions in a patriarchal family structure."That is why the chief goal of feminists like Okin is to restructure the familyas a totally contractual arrangement from which anyone, but especially anywoman, may withdraw at will.<p><p><p>But is this goal morally defensible? There's a very good reason why liberalismhas never stopped seeing the family as an organic institution. Beginning withJohn Locke, liberalism has understood that not all human ties arecontractual--most notably the tie between a parent and a child. Lockedistinguished between legitimate political power, which may extend to life anddeath because it derives from the consent of the governed, and parental power,which may extend only to preserving the life of the child, because it does not,and cannot, derive from the consent of the child.<p><p><p>This crucial distinction collapses every time pro-choice arguments flip-flopbetween the language of individual rights and that of nurturant femininity.Pro-choicers begin by asserting equal rights for women--a line of reasoningthat challenges the organic basis of family relationships. But equal rights arenot enough when it comes to abortion, a decision that must balance women'srights against those of others, such as fetuses and family members. Sopro-choicers define women's rights as more than equal, on the grounds thatfemale decision-making partakes of a special moral wisdom. But what is thesource of that wisdom? Not women's character or achievement as individuals buttheir membership in a class whose nature it is to care for others--a definitionof womanhood that is nothing if not organic.<p><p><p><p><br><p><br><b>Bring on the Bull</b><p><p><p>By such maneuvering, pro-choice advocates can usually avoid admitting that therelationship between a woman and a fetus is not contractual. But if notcontractual, then it must be organic--an outcome that leaves pro-choicers withonly two options. They can deny the humanity of the fetus, which (as we'veseen) is both unpopular and unproductive. Or they can change the subject.<p><p><p>Because the comparison between maternal and fetal consent favors the fetus, thelogical solution is to shift to a comparison that favors the woman--that is,between the degrees of consent exercised by men and women having sex. In itswisdom (which has remained remarkably consistent over the years), publicopinion tolerates legal abortion in cases of coercive sex, such as rape andincest. But this consensus isn't good enough for those pro-choice activists whohave an overriding rhetorical need to stress female, as opposed to fetal,helplessness. Their hypocrisy peaks when, after granting women life-and-deathpower over the unborn, they depict sexual relations as beyond women'scontrol--in rhetoric that harks back to the old militant equation of sex andrape, as expressed by the activist who told Kristin Luker that withoutabortion, women would have "about as many rights as the cow in the pasturethat's taken to the bull once a year. "<p><p><p>This is not to suggest that the activists counsel sexual restraint. Like most"progressive" people, they have a horror of appearing prudish. Nor do they wantto revive the old double standard that gave men more sexual liberty than women.Yet their dislike of male irresponsibility makes it tricky to advocate similarbehavior in women. Perforce, they resolve the conflict by taking the "me first"ethic of the sexual revolution and cloaking it in the "caring" verbiage ofsuperiority feminism. Here is Luker's summary of the pro-choice view of sex:<p><p><p>"Because mobilizing such delicate social and emotional resources as trust,caring, and intimacy requires practice, pro-choice people do not denigratesexual experiences that fall short of achieving transcendence. They judgeindividual cases of premarital sex, contraception, and infidelity according tothe ways in which they enhance or detract from conditions of trust and caring.In their value scheme, something that gives people opportunities for intimacysimply cannot be seen as wrong."<p><p><p>Does this mean that when Hank Williams sang "Your Cheatin' Heart," he wasreally singing about a practice mobilization of delicate trusting and caringresources by a person given an opportunity for intimacy? More likely, Hankmeant that the human objects of trust, caring, and intimacy shouldn't be battedaround for practice, like so many interchangeable tennis balls. Since the mainpurpose of such verbiage is to rationalize self-indulgence, it's no wonder thatsuch verbiage also dominates feminist discussions of the higher morality ofabortion.<p><p><p><p><br><p><br><b>Family Pictures</b><p><p><p>Take Carol Gilligan's "concepts of self and morality" in a group of womenconsidering abortion. There's nothing objectionable about her claim that womenfaced with unwanted pregnancies tend to weigh "selfishness" against"responsibility." But there's plenty objectionable about her tortured effortsto interpret abortion as always a responsible decision. According to herdiscussion, the women who were Catholic concluded that the "honesty and truth"of their own desires was worth more than the Catholic "conventions that equategoodness with self-sacrifice." The single women, mired in dead-end affairs withexploitative Don Juans, decided that destroying their lovers' potentialoffspring was a way of affirming their self-esteem. And onetwenty-nine-year-old married woman reasoned that it was selfish to bear herchild and adult to abort it.<p><p><p>In Gilligan's view, a woman is not permitted to put the needs of other peoplefirst, because "self-sacrifice" is the linchpin of female oppression. Instead,she is expected to ascend to a higher level of enlightened self-regard, wherethe act of putting her own needs first is tantamount to striking a blow forwomen's freedom. But what if the other people involved are also women? Considerthe scenario of the pregnant teenager who decides, against the wishes of hermother, to abort a female fetus. In the one instance, she is depriving an olderfemale of a grandchild. In the other, she is depriving a younger female oflife. Compared with such deprivations, the idea of striking a blow for women'sfreedom seems pretty absract, impersonal, and public--rather like Gilligan'sstereotype of male moral reasoning.<p><p><p>The above scenario may not be typical, but neither is it as lurid as thepicture of the American family currently being drawn by pro-choice activistsopposing the various state laws that are trying, in the wake of the SupremeCourt's Webster decision, to restore the attenuated interests of other familymembers in the life of the unborn. Again, the goal of pro-choice rhetoric is toemphasize female helplessness. But because the battleground is now the familyitself, the rhetoric of abuse and violation gets applied to the parents ofminors seeking abortions. In a full-page ad in The New York Times, PlannedParenthood explains "What's Wrong With Parental Consent" as follows: "Indeed,after hearing evidence of family conflict and brutal violence, an appeals judgewrote 'compelling parental notice...is almost always disastrous.'"<p><p><p>Never mind the deliberate confusion of "parental consent" with "parentalnotice." Just look at the model of family life offered by pro-choice activistsand their allies as the basis for law. On the one hand, minors should havecomplete sexual license, because younger people need to practice thoseall-important skills of trust, caring, and intimacy. On the other hand, parentsshould be kept in the dark, because older people cannot be trusted to refrainfrom brutal violence. A favorite variation on this theme is the tale of themolesting father who murders his daughter after learning that she is pregnantwith his child. The activists don't want the law to make provisions for thesegrim exceptions; they want it to enshrine them as the rule.<p><p><p><p><br><p><br><b>Fewer Females?</b><p><p><p>We now arrive at the real legacy of feminist doublethink, with its contempt forthe values of the unliberated majority and its misplaced faith in thesuperiority of female moral reasoning. Substitute "feminist superiority" for"female superiority," and the actual tendency of the movement becomes clear.Not only does feminist doublethink accord women the exclusive power toterminate potential life while absolving them of any responsibility for havingconceived life in the first place; this doublethink also extends its influence,by way of the helping professionals and judges under its sway, over the poor,the confused, and the underaged, who are urged to heed the feminist messageover the advice of their own families.<p><p><p>Nor is this power being exercised in the name of a clearly defined kinshipgroup, as was the power of the Roman paterfamilias. Rather it is being wieldedin the name of all women, a category that includes not only the majority ofpeople who disagree with the pro-choice position on abortion but also half thepotential lives being aborted. It's a measure of feminist fanaticism that onlyrecently have pro-choice activists announced their unwillingness to defendabortion as a method of sex selection. Perhaps it occurred to them thatsex-preferential practices have historically favored the male, and that bysanctioning such abortions, they are quite likely causing fewer females to beborn. If this was their reasoning, then it's time to stand back and watchfeminism collide with itself.<p></blockquote><p><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><br><p><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1990 by Martha Bayles.

	<font size=5>"I</font>n all the Western States, except Ohio," says the national commissioner of
education in his report for 1873, "there prevails a nearly uniform school
system, in which county superintendents, subordinate to a State superintendent
of public instruction, oversee schools graded up from elementary to a
respectable secondary training, a State university crowning the whole with its
scientific and classical departments. Illinois has to a certain extent stood
apart from others in this last respect, but the State Industrial University, of
great proportions, is putting her substantially in line with them, especially
as regards scientific studies."<p>

<p>

In perusing the school reports of the West, one is struck with the
overshadowing prominence of the reports of the State as compared with those of
the county superintendents. We have remarked that even in the Middle States the
local officers were less discriminating in their criticisms than those of
Southern New England. In the West they may almost be said to disappear, so
brief and merely statistical are their communications. The State
superintendents, on the other hand, seem to be abler men than those who in
general fill the office in the East, or at least they are more alive to the
problems before them, and more earnest in trying to solve them. They all quote
much from one another and from Horace Mann, and to come upon the same thing in
report after report does not say much for the extent and variety of their
pedagogical reading. The apology for this, however, is that the office-work of
the position in most States is altogether too oppressive, and the compensation
too small, to permit those who fill it to devote themselves to the study of the
science or to the perfecting of the art of education, as they otherwise could
and probably would do.<p>

<p>

At present, the Western education is no doubt in a very crude and rudimentary
state, but the broad foundations of it are being laid so that time cannot but
bring to it a magnificent culmination. While the high-school system does not
exist in all its plenitude, i.e., has not penetrated into the smaller towns to
the same extent as in Massachusetts, yet high schools are in operation in many
Western cities, and very large sums are often spent upon the buildings
appropriated to them. But, better than this, the authorities of the
universities of three leading States, Michigan, Wisconsin, and California, have
opened their doors without further examination to the graduates of all high
schools which will grade their classes to the college standard, and they have
appointed committees from their faculties to visit these schools annually.
Michigan was the first to initiate this union between her high schools and her
university, and the State superintendent thus sums up its benefits: "Such a
policy cannot fail to prove a stimulus to our high schools, and lead to the
adoption of better devised courses of study. That exclusiveness, too, which
bred indifference in days gone by, has given way to a freedom of intercourse
between the instructors in the university and the public schools which predicts
a happier condition for each. The president of the university becomes the
presiding officer of the State teachers' association. He strikes hands with the
superintendents and principals of our Union schools at the educational
meetings. A free interchange of views is had, which results in a better
understanding of the wishes and wants of the university, and in a practical
unanimity of feeling and action." In Wisconsin, "the effect of the new
measure," says the State superintendent, Rev. Samuel Fellows, "has thus far
been most beneficial. All over the State, students are preparing in the graded
schools near their homes for the university. As might have been anticipated and
desired, the number of students in the preparatory department has diminished,
while that in the college classes has increased. Other States are making
efforts to connect their graded schools with their universities in like manner,
and in some places denominational colleges are opening their classes to
students similarly prepared." Mr. Fellows took office in 1870 for the express
purpose of trying to bring, by this measure, free education throughout the
State into a consistent whole. "The vital bond," he said, "between the
university and the common school is the high school," and he disapproved of the
preparatory school of the university as tending to make citizens slow to
develop high schools in their own neighborhoods, and as taking away the pupils
too early from their homes. How important this movement is to the Western
colleges will appear from the fact that they themselves are obliged to prepare
eighty-three out of every hundred students who enter their classes, while the
New England colleges are burdened with the preparation of only one in a
hundred, so that the Hon. Newton Bateman, of Illinois, as well as the
superintendents of Michigan and Missouri, concurs with Mr. Fellows in the
desirableness of "bringing the higher instruction to the very doors of the
people, in order to save the expense and the moral and social risks incidental
to boarding-schools and other institutions remote from the salutary restraints
of home." This is the reverse of much thinking that we find in high educational
quarters in the East. Our national commissioner, for example, General John
Eaton, finds it "desirable that in addition to the public high schools there
should be a class of endowed and chartered schools,...for the sake of variety
of means and modes of education, and of the mutual influence of schools
differently organized in competition for excellence....The high school is
usually the home school. It is often a great advantage to the young student to
be thrown during some portion of his secondary schooling into new scenes and
associations;...narrow, home-bred fancies are dispelled, and he perhaps
receives his first impressive discipline in manliness and self-control." This
sounds well, but the moral evils of boarding-schools, so forcibly indicated by
the philosopher Locke, remain just as true to-day as when he wrote them apropos
of Eaton and Harrow in England two hundred years ago. Of two evils a good
boarding-school is better than an unhappy or ill-regulated home, but that a
good day-school, whether public or private, is the best of all schools is the
true dictum of American belief and experience.<p>

<p>

The earnest support given by the Western superintendents to their collegiate
system is in such marked contrast to the silence of the Eastern superintendents
upon the same subject, that we cannot refrain from one or two extracts as
specimens of their spirit. The superintendent of Indiana says, "The university
is not independent of the common schools, nor are they independent of the
university. They are natural aids. The latter supplies the common schools with
teachers, and in turn they supply it with students. No jealousy should exist
between them. All are integral parts of the same great educational system....It
is the very highest interest of a State to provide facilities for an extended
education. While her prosperity is in great measure dependent upon the general
intelligence of her people, there is at the same time a most imperious demand
for men of a high order of culture and scientific attainments. Who can
calculate to a country the real value of a Columbus or a Fulton, of a Newton or
a Franklin? The university that gives to the world only ONE such man repays the
public a thousand fold for all expenditures. Without the universities, the
sciences are practiced; within, they are created. Books are read without, but
written within. These are the fountains whence issue the streams of thought,
and they sustain a relation to our common schools like that of the ocean to the
lakes, pools, rivers, rivulets, and springs." The Hon. Newton Bateman, of
Illinois, the most experienced as well as the ablest State superintendent of
the West, thus answers the question how far a State should undertake to provide
for the education of its children at public cost. "I would see every American
State add to the elementary school, the grammar school; to the grammar school,
the high school; to the high school, the State university; and to the State
university I would see the American Congress add a national university, as a
fitting top-stone to the whole magnificent edifice. And I would have the whole
FREE--every door flung wide open, and the invitation repeated along the whole
line from one end of it to the other, 'Whosoever will, let him come'...A
portion of the public domain surrendered during the last ten years to the
rapacity of monster monopolies...would have reared in every State of the Union
a free university....Meanwhile, the little that was saved in better days and
consecrated to the education of the people is often grudgingly allowed; the
free universities and colleges are crippled for means, and a determined effort
is made to force the States to call in their advanced free-school out-posts,
close their high schools and colleges, and retire within the elementary lines
of fifty years ago.<p>

<p>

Besides the affiliation of the high schools with the Western State
universities, Western superintendents and teachers are now urging the
inauguration of a normal department in the latter, wherein those who intend to
engage in teaching can go through a course and receive a special degree in
pedagogy and psychology. In their opinion, this would do much to secure for
teaching a public recognition as a profession, since all other liberal
professions have their appropriate college degrees. When this is accomplished,
so that the principals of schools shall be college-bred men and women in at
least the same proportion that doctors and lawyers and clergymen are so; when,
too, the high-school system thoroughly permeates the whole community, so that
all the assistants shall be high-school graduates, the necessity, as we cannot
but think, for those make-shifts, the "normal school" and the "teachers'
institute," will disappear. The very conception of a school where the teacher
is to learn precisely what he is to teach is stultifying, and if from the first
the progress of education had been sought by connecting pedagogy with the
universities as law and medicine and divinity are connected, instead of
organizing mills called normal schools where teachers are ground out by the
dozen, the whole question of public-school instruction would have been in a
very different state from its present one. Such a degree now inaugurated by the
Western colleges would act as a needed stimulus and encouragement to that sex
which seems in our country to have found in teaching its special vocation.
Apropos of the presence of women in colleges, the testimony from the West seems
to be universal that there is none of that falling behind the classes, of that
breaking health, or of those improprieties and immoralities that are so much
dreaded in the East should like educational privileges be opened to them here.
We regret extremely, however, that in the report upon the University of
Michigan the recommendation is made that, from reasons of economy, there be no
longer any separate medical classes for the men and women students. We most
emphatically believe that to instruct the sexes in each other's presence upon
subjects over which nature or training--or both--has drawn a veil of reserve
would be a most disastrous mistake, and would in the long run lead to both
intellectual and moral degradation.<p>

<p>

--We took occasion, a few months ago, when noticing a volume of the Clarendon
Press series of English authors, to speak of the need there was of good and
inexpensive editions of English and American classics for the use of schools,
and of the help that such books would afford in the study of English
literature, now beginning to assume its proper place in courses of education.
The little volume of Oliver Goldsmith's Select Poems [see Endnote] just put
forth by Mr. Rolfe, who has already edited certain of Shakespeare's plays,
comes very near to our ideal of what such a book should be. He has taken The
Traveler, The Deserted Village, and Retaliation, prefixed an introduction, and
appended notes. The introduction contains Macaulay's Life of Goldsmith with
omissions, and selections from other memoirs by Thackeray, Forster, Irving,
George Colman the younger, and Campbell. By this means he has not only given
different views of the poet, but also used the reflective interest which
proceeds from the comments of one eminent author upon another. The notes take a
wide range of explanation and suggestion, and can hardly fail to be helpful to
both teacher and scholar. We have been interested in comparing them with those
by Mr. Hales, who has prepared a similar edition in England. Mr. Rolfe has
acknowledged his indebtedness to the English author, but his use of Hales's
work has been both honest and discriminating, The American edition is much
better adapted to use in our schools than the English, since it draws its
historical and literary illustration from a wider range, and confines its
philological notes more distinctly to those authors, ancient and modern, whom
the American reader has been likely to read, or to whose works he has access.
Perhaps it was expedient to introduce the illustrations; we are glad to see the
portrait and Foley's statue, but could well spare the imaginative pictures, if
we could have in place, room for a portion, say, of the thirteenth chapter of
Boswell's Johnson, getting thus not only glimpses of Goldsmith's personality as
it was seen by Boswell, but a taste of a remarkable book which ought to be
introduced to the young reader by such means. The volume is still too
expensive, even at its moderate price, to serve the best purposes of a school
edition, but probably we shall have to work toward cheap and scholarly editions
by degrees, and our complaint in this case is rather based on the supposition
that this is one of a projected series of classics.<p>

who also once wielded a T square on film.) Gruff and rumpled, handsome and 
Armani-suited, the architects make their presentations to the orchestra 
committee, displaying portfolios bulging with photographs of impressive 
museums, dramatic corporate headquarters, and, of course, eye-popping 
concert halls.  <P> Surprisingly, one of the unseasoned newcomers is among 
the chosen seven.  (<A 
HREF="http://us2.imdb.com/M/person-exact?Hanks,%20Tom">Tom Hanks</A> has 
the <A HREF="http://us2.imdb.com/M/person-exact?Stewart,%20James">Jimmy 
Stewart</A> role.) He is hampered by never having built a concert hall, so 
he shows his latest project instead--affordable housing on the waterfront.  
Then he makes a fervent speech about the rural site of the new hall--its 
landscape, its spirit, its ambiance.  He talks about the kind of building 
he thinks the orchestra needs: open, informal, yet reflecting the intensity 
of the music.  It shouldn't overpower the place, he warns, and he calls it 
a background building.  (This is a fine set piece: the earnest and 
impassioned architect confronting the attentive but skeptical committee of 
civic leaders, retired businessmen, and wealthy socialites.) Finally our 
hero returns to his office.  He is dejected.  The committee appeared 
interested, but what chance does he have against the architectural 
stars?<P> Meanwhile, everyone on the symphony committee has his or her own 
favorites.  The chairman suggests an informal poll, with each member 
writing two names on a slip of paper.  When the ballots are read, there is 
general surprise at the discovery that only one candidate appears as the 
first or second choice on every single ballot: Hanks.  After more 
deliberation the final choice is made.  It is, of course, our hero.  As in 
every Capra movie, the outcome is predictable, but that's the appeal.<P> 
The architect travels to Europe to visit famous concert halls.  Together 
with the acoustician (<A 
HREF="http://us2.imdb.com/M/person-exact?Grodin,%20Charles">Charles 
Grodin</A> in the co-starring role), he develops a design.  The building 
goes up.  It certainly looks impressive, but how will it sound?  After the 
rehearsal the musicians seem happy.  It's going to be fine, Grodin says.  
But that prognosis is based on an empty hall--how will it sound with an 
audience at the opening gala?  More to the point, how will it sound to 
influential music critics?  Cut to opening night, when we see the critic 
for <I>The New York Times</I> among the concertgoers (Edward Rothstein 
plays himself).  The music starts.  The critic sits concentrating intently, 
his brow furrowed.  He looks slightly irritated.  During the intermission 
he gets up and moves to another seat.  We start to get nervous--will this 
be a movie with a fashionably unhappy ending?  <P> The next day Hanks and 
Grodin read Rothstein's review.  "Precisely what a concert hall should be," 
Rothstein writes.  "It is rare for a new hall to begin its career with such 
a mature, seasoned character." The movie ends with a reprise of the closing 
of the gala concert and the music of Randall Thompson's <I>Alleluia</I>, an 
unaccompanied chorus with the audience joining in.  The camera pulls back 
from the stage, across the heads of the singing people, and through the 
great doors at the rear of the hall to the outside lawn, where more people 
sit and sprawl on the grass.  As the camera rises, we see the dark 
silhouettes of the rolling hills on the horizon.  Below us the warm glow of 
the light spilling out the doors identifies the concert hall.  The patch of 
light glows smaller as the credits begin to roll.<P> The critical reception 
of the acoustical qualities of Seiji Ozawa Hall, designed by the architect 
William L.  Rawn III, has been consistently favorable, although Rothstein 
did have a quibble about "too much being shaved off the top frequencies." 
After the first season the hall's acoustician, R.  Lawrence Kirkegaard, 
ordered the removal of an eighth of an inch of the absorptive cellulose 
fiber that covered the ceiling, and the sound was judged to be improved.  
Such tinkering is not uncommon in a new hall.  What is unusual is for the 
sound of a new concert hall to be so widely praised: the reaction to new 
halls has frequently been lukewarm if not downright hostile.  It is usually 
the old halls that are loved and admired.<P> A case in point is Boston's 
Symphony Hall, which is generally held to be the first hall in whose design 
the <A 
HREF="http://www.cf.ac.uk/uwcc/archi/howshall/studio/dissert/history.html">science 
of acoustics</A> played a role.  It was built at the turn of the twentieth 
century and designed by the great architectural firm of McKim, Mead and 
White, working in their full-blown Italian Renaissance mode and with the 
assistance of Wallace Clement Sabine, a professor of physics at Harvard and 
the father of modern architectural acoustics.  The music critic for the 
Boston <I>Evening Transcript</I> was not impressed, however: after the 
inaugural concert he wrote that "the tone was beautifully smooth .  .  .  
but it had no life, there was nothing commanding and compelling about it." 
Nevertheless, Symphony Hall has become known precisely for its exceptional 
sound.  "Even the first time that I conducted there, I was struck by its 
acoustics," Bruno Walter said thirty-five years ago.  "It is the most noble 
of American concert halls." Herbert von Karajan was still more effusive, 
going so far as to say that Symphony Hall was better for much music than 
the Grosser Musikvereinssaal, in Vienna--considered by many to be the best 
hall in the world.<P> Of course, "the best hall in the world" is a slippery 
concept, since settings for music have changed considerably over time--as 
has music itself.  Baroque orchestral music was played in small rooms that 
had a relatively short (less than 1.5 seconds) "reverberation time"--the 
length of time that sound gives the impression of lingering as a result of 
being reflected by hard surfaces.  Short reverberation times are ideal for 
intimate and highly defined music.  Sacred music, such as Bach's early 
fugues, was often written to be performed in small private chapels whose 
reverberation times were relatively short.  Some choral works, on the other 
hand, were staged in larger churches, and took advantage of the more 
reverberative spaces.  During the Classical period the music of Haydn and 
Mozart was performed in what were the first concert halls.  Although these 
halls were small by modern standards, and sat only several hundred people, 
the reverberation times were longer than those in private chapels--1.5 to 
1.7 seconds.  The popularity of orchestral music during the second half of 
the nineteenth century brought a new generation of larger concert halls.  
The Musikvereinssaal, for example, opened in 1870 and has 1,680 seats.  
Such halls have longer reverberation times (1.9 to 2.2 seconds), with 
fuller tones but slightly lower definition, which complements the music of 
Romantic composers like Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and Richard Strauss.  <P> The 
music of the twentieth century is more varied in its demands, and any hall 
in which the work of composers ranging from Bach to G&oacute;recki is 
performed requires a compromise.  Nevertheless, there is a surprising 
amount of agreement about which are the best-sounding concert halls.  Most 
musicians, critics, and concertgoers would probably include not only 
Vienna's Musikvereinssaal and Boston's Symphony Hall but also Amsterdam's 
Concertgebouw and New York's Carnegie Hall.  A systematic study of these 
and other halls is contained in the recently published <I><A 
HREF="http://www.aip.org/aippress/newtitles/titles/concert_and_opera_halls.html">Concert 
and Opera Halls: How They Sound</A></I>, a vastly revised and enlarged 
edition of the now-classic study <I>Music, Acoustics & Architecture, 
</I>which was originally published in 1962.  The author is Leo L.  Beranek, 
an acoustician based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who is a founder of what 
has become probably the world's leading firm of acoustical consultants--<A 
HREF="http://www.bbn.com:80/more_technologies/language_understanding/history.html">Bolt, 
Beranek and Newman.</A><P> Beranek, an amateur musician, visited sixty-six 
famous concert halls and ten opera houses around the world.  He listened to 
performances, measured reverberation times, and studied blueprints.  He 
polled concertgoers and talked to music critics.  He also interviewed 
musicians, including <A

HREF="http://www.classicalmus.com/artists/stokowsk.html">Leopold 
Stokowski</A>, <A 
HREF="http://www.classicalmus.com/bmgclassics/biography/bernstei.html">Leonard 
Bernstein,</A> Von Karajan, and Walter.  Eugene Ormandy told him, "In my 
many years as a conductor, this is the first time anyone has come to me to 
ask my opinion about acoustics." Beranek accorded his top rating, 
"superior," to only the Musikvereinssaal, Symphony Hall, and the 
Concertgebouw.  He described an additional six concert halls as 
"excellent": Basel's Stadt-Casino, Berlin's Konzerthaus (formerly 
Schauspielhaus), Cardiff's St.  David's Hall, New York's Carnegie Hall, 
Tokyo's Hamarikyu Asahi, and Zurich's Grosser Tonhallesaal.  The rest of 
the halls he consigned to lesser categories, although he was diplomatic 
enough not to give a detailed ranking.  <P> Why do old halls sound better 
than new ones?  To a large extent it is a question of shape.  <A 
HREF="http://www.cf.ac.uk/uwcc/archi/howshall/studio/dissert/forms.html">The 
Musikvereinssaal (1870), the Concertgebouw (1888), and Symphony Hall (1900) 
all have a shoebox shape, and so do four of the six halls in the 
"excellent" category.</A> (St.  David's Hall is hexagonal in plan, and 
Carnegie Hall is rectangular but not a traditional shoebox.) In a typical 
shoebox the orchestra is at one end, and the seats are on the floor and in 
one gallery extending along the sides and across the opposite end.  Sound 
is reflected to the listener from the two long sides, which are about sixty 
to eighty feet apart, and also from the ceiling.  Because the concertgoer 
is relatively close to the musicians, the atmosphere is intimate, visually 
and acoustically.  <P> The majority of concert halls built during the 
twentieth century have departed from the successful shoebox formula.  Why?  
One reason is a need for greater seating capacity; another is higher 
standards of comfort and safety.  Basel's Stadt-Casino has only 1,448 
seats.  Many contemporary concert halls, especially in America, where 
orchestras rely more on box-office receipts than on government subsidies, 
approach 3,000.  To bring the rear seats closer to the stage, halls have 
been made wider or fan-shaped.  This sacrifices some of the acoustical 
qualities of the shoebox, especially the ability to reflect bass notes from 
the side walls.  Audience capacity may not, however, be the main reason for 
the change.  After all, Symphony Hall, the largest of the shoeboxes, 
accommodates as many as 2,625 concertgoers--about the same as Lincoln 
Center's Philharmonic Hall, which opened in 1962, and which had an 
untraditional shape.  So perhaps architects' willful desire to reinvent the 
wheel is also part of the explanation.<P> Because Ozawa Hall was to be 
small --seating was not to exceed 1,200--it could follow the tried-and-true 
models.  "The shoebox shape was identified very early," says Kirkegaard, 
who trained at Harvard as an architect and was the acoustician responsible 
for the 1989 corrections to the 1986 remodeling of Carnegie Hall.  He 
apprenticed with Bolt, Beranek and Newman at the time the firm was 
struggling with the acoustical shortcomings of Philharmonic Hall.  (The 
sound in Philharmonic Hall proved so bad that the interior was gutted and 
Avery Fisher Hall, a classic shoebox, was put in its place.) "The Boston 
Symphony musicians love their hall, and all their favorite concert halls 
were that shape," Kirkegaard says.  On his European tour Rawn was 
especially impressed by the architectural presence of the Musikvereinssaal 
and Berlin's Konzerthaus, another nineteenth-century shoebox, designed by 
the great neoclassical architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel (and rebuilt to 
the original plans after the Second World War).  Ozawa Hall is seventy feet 
wide, 140 feet long, and fifty feet high, about the same size as the 
Musikvereinssaal; it has two side balconies, like Symphony Hall.  One 
feature of Ozawa Hall is unique: much of the rear wall consists of doors 
that slide open, permitting another 2,000 concertgoers to listen to the 
music on the gently sloping lawn outside, thanks to a sophisticated sound 
system that mirrors the hall's acoustics for the outdoor listeners.<P> 
<I>Concert and Opera Halls</I> concludes with three general observations: 
small halls generally sound better than large halls; halls built for a 
single purpose are superior to multi-purpose halls; and old halls sound 
better than new ones.  These observations obviously influenced the design 
of Seiji Ozawa Hall.  The new hall was being built as a replacement for a 
wooden structure called The Theatre, built in 1941 to a design by Eliel and 
Eero Saarinen.  The Theatre had served for both opera and concert music; 
since 1962 it had been used only for rehearsal.  The initial plan was to 
accommodate both types of programming.  However, "as the design progressed, 
Bill Rawn slowly but firmly steered us to the conviction that a hall 
designed uniquely for concert music was the best solution," Daniel R.  
Gustin, the manager of Tanglewood, recalls.  This avoided the 
complexity--and the cost--of an orchestra pit, a room for scenery, and 
other backstage facilities.  (Some of the funding was diverted toward 
restoring The Theatre, so that opera can be staged there.) And, as we shall 
see, a concert hall can benefit from the lack of a proscenium stage.<P> 
Another lesson that old concert halls teach concerns construction.  Their 
walls and ceilings were usually plaster applied directly to heavy brick or 
stone; there was relatively little wood.  Massive walls sustain a 
low-frequency bass response, unlike hollow walls and lightweight wood 
paneling, which tend to reflect only the treble notes.  Although the 
interior of Ozawa Hall has a lot of <A 
HREF="http://www.woodweb.com/backart/cwb/cwbwami.html">exposed wood 
(teak),</A> it is confined to the seats and the balcony railings; the walls 
are stucco over very thick masonry, and the ceiling consists of heavy 
concrete coffers.  The result is, as Rothstein put it in his review, "a 
resonant, warm space that comes to life with sound."<P> The enjoyment of 
music in a concert hall is not only the auditory result of construction, 
dimensions, and shape.  Architecture, too, plays an important role.  If the 
new hall is traditional in its overall internal arrangement, it is much 
less so in its decor: Rawn's respect for the past does not extend to the 
use of classical architectural language.  There is no figurative ornament 
here, no statuary as in Symphony Hall, no caryatids supporting the 
balconies as in the Musikvereinssaal, no crystal chandeliers as in the 
Stadt-Casino.  But neither is this a cold, abstract modernist interior, 
like the recently constructed Op&eacute;ra Bastille in Paris, of which the 
soprano June Anderson has said, "The place looks like a gymnasium." <P> 
Ozawa Hall certainly doesn't look like a gymnasium.  Some have likened it 
to a Quaker meetinghouse or a New England town hall.  There is certainly an 
air of gathering here.  In doing away with the proscenium that is common to 
so many American concert halls, pulling the stage into the main body of the 
hall, and in placing some of the audience beside and even behind the 
musicians (as at the Concertgebouw), Rawn has given concertgoers the 
feeling of being participants.  The teak grilles that make up the balcony 
railings remind me of yacht gratings, and the seats, which are mainly 
movable chairs, recall the deck furniture on a cruise ship.  If this is a 
Quaker meetinghouse--and there is a sense of artlessness in the 
unembellished forms--it is one whose frugality is tempered by hints of 
boating, and leisure, and summer vacations.  My only quibble is that the 
decor is almost too refined: one misses the makeshift, camplike quality of 
the other buildings at Tanglewood.<P> The exterior shape of the building 
recalls Symphony Hall, except that the roof is gently curved instead of 
pitched and the lower flanking wings have open porches instead of solid 
walls.  Because the main hall is brick and the structure of the porches is 
heavy timber (recycled from old wharves and trestle bridges), the overall 
effect is of an industrial building--a nineteenth-century mill, say, of the 
kind that one can still see in many small Massachusetts towns.  That sounds 
unusual, but Tanglewood itself is an odd combination of urban culture and 
country setting, of intensity and informality.<P> When I visited Bill 
Rawn's office, in downtown Boston, he showed me one of the sketchbooks he 
kept during his European tour of concert halls.  Now, many architects keep 
such visual diaries.  What struck me about Rawn's sketchbook was that 
although it contained the usual thumbnail drawings, there were also pages 
and pages of written notes.  Obviously he had been looking and listening, 
but he had also been thinking.  Contemporary architecture can represent a 
range of qualities: refinement, excitement--even, in the case of much 
deconstructivist work, angst.  It is rare, however, to come across an 
architect whose work can be described, first and foremost, as intelligent.  
I think this is probably what impressed the Boston Symphony Orchestra 
committee, and led them to make a choice that must have seemed risky at the 
time.  A bold client, an intelligent architect, and a perceptive 
acoustician--that is a Hollywood script indeed.  </blockquote><p>

<blockquote>

	

	<font size=5>I</font> HAD been warned, by friends and by the media, about the Chinese

orphanage--the dying room for infants and the children being allowed to starve.

But I was not prepared. I had expected the dying children to be crying, begging

to be saved. Instead they were silent, withdrawn, immobile. They had no

expectation of being comforted or saved, or even any obvious awareness of the

two women passing by. They were miniature versions of the "Muselm&auml;nner" of

the Nazi concentration camps, the ones who stopped struggling, gave up living,

waited only for death--the ones from whom other inmates recoiled, as though the

Muselm&auml;nner's resignation were contagious, the kiss of death. Now I, too,

recoiled, in an involuntary lapse of compassion.<p>

I cannot mention the real name of the woman who first took me to the orphanage,

which is in southern China, in a complex that houses some 300 to 350 children

and 250 disabled or elderly adults. I will call her Christine. <p>



The kind of work Christine is doing was one answer to my question about what

good, beyond sheer economic prosperity, the Western business presence in China

might be bringing to that nation. The question had bothered me during the

1993-1994 debate about whether to renew China's <A HREF="http://student.bio.geneseo.edu/ccf/ccf9425-1.html">most-favored-nation status</A>. The

public discussions had highlighted the gap between Americans who did business

in China, most of whom wanted the renewal of MFN status, and human-rights

advocates, who by and large supported the Clinton Administration's initial

requirement that China first make "significant, overall progress" on issues of

human rights. Human-rights advocates were naturally suspicious of business, and

the businesspeople's obvious economic interests weakened their argument that

their presence in China was good for human rights. I was acquainted with

numerous Western businesspeople in China and knew that many had come to love

the country. I suspected that some were quietly involved in "good works,"

serving the cause of human rights while avoiding publicity. My hunch proved

correct.<p>



The wives of foreign businessmen and diplomats had formed an association, one

foreign businessman and his wife told me over lunch in an elegant joint-venture

hotel. They had "adopted" a local orphanage. A small group visited once a week.

Most women, particularly those with small children, found visiting the

orphanage too painful, but everyone contributed to the children's

well-being--toys, clothing, shoes, quilts, screens to keep out the flies and

mosquitoes. The couple gave me Christine's number. A resident of China for

several years and an active volunteer, Christine was a regular visitor to the

orphanage. I called her immediately.<p>

<blockquote>



The children who were old enough and able to walk were waiting at the windows

when we arrived, broad smiles on their faces. They exclaimed over Christine's

oversize bag when we walked in, knowing it would be filled with crackers.

Christine had a surprise for them that day--sneakers in bright colors and

psychedelic designs, which she distributed to the barefoot children according

to approximate size. The children tried them on, jumping and prancing and

running, their thumbs up in the universal language of delight. They were an

unruly, unsocialized group. Some were handicapped. Others seemed retarded,

though the foreign volunteers were convinced that what appeared as retardation

was often really a failure to thrive, the result of too little love and

attention. <p>



The vast majority of the children, some 90 percent, were thought by the foreign

volunteers to be girls, though this was not readily apparent. Their hair was

cropped short, institutional-style, and their clothes were unisex shorts and

T-shirts. Few of them were actually orphans. They had been abandoned--victims

of China's one-child-per-family policy and of the traditional, economically

motivated propensity to value males. Males both carry on the family line and

provide for their parents in old age. Girls marry and then have obligations

only to their husband's family. Rural China has no pension system. The retired

depend for survival on their sons.<p>



Recent census figures indicate how badly the Chinese want boys. In 1994 the

worldwide sex ratio at birth was 101.5 boys for every 100 girls. In China there

were 116 boys for every 100 girls. No one is certain what happens to the

missing girls. Some may be aborted after a sonogram reveals a female fetus,

though this practice was recently declared illegal. The traditional practice of

female infanticide, described decades ago by Pearl S. Buck and Somerset

Maugham, may still exist. Some baby girls may not be reported in the census.

Rural families are often allowed to have two children. When the first is a

girl, some families wait to record the birth until the second child proves to

be a boy. Some baby girls are abandoned. <p>



The orphanage I visited is on the outskirts of a city, but the little girls

were presumed to have come mostly from rural backgrounds. China is in the midst

of what must be the largest rural-to-urban migration in human history. In

recent years perhaps 100 million of China's 900 million peasants have moved to

cities in search of jobs. The baby girls are left at railway stations, in

parks, and in front of police stations. The police are supposed to search for

the parents, but most searches prove fruitless. The boys in the orphanage are

for the most part severely handicapped, but they are often not abandoned, and

may have family contact and visits.<p>



Newly arrived infants are placed in a separate small room, which held about ten

baby girls during my visits. Two or three staff members--untrained, minimally

paid women from nearby villages who were struggling to support their own

families--were on hand for the infants. The babies were cuddly, cute, and

alert.<p>



Adoption is not unusual in Chinese tradition. I have known several infertile

urban couples who adopted a child from one of their married siblings. In rural

areas, despite the economic value placed on boys, families without female

children have sometimes adopted little girls. The current one-child-per-family

policy makes domestic adoptions more difficult, however. A couple must be

childless and at least thirty-five years old before regulations permit them to

adopt. But the pediatrician in charge of the orphanage told me that "normal"

infants do find new homes. Some forty babies had been adopted the previous

year, more than twenty of them by foreigners and the rest, presumably, by

Chinese. I watched one day as Susan Lee, a single Chinese-American woman who

works for the Federal Aviation Administration, in Washington, D.C., met her new

daughter, Rachel, then eight months old. The baby had been in the orphanage

since only a few days after she was born. When I had dinner with the new family

a few days later, Rachel, who had been alert and curious when I first saw her

but had been unable to hold up her head, was already discernibly stronger.<p>



Babies who are not adopted are eventually moved out of the infant room into

what the foreign women call the toddlers' room, a much larger space with six

rows of eight cribs each. Staffing is minimal there--three or four women for

forty-eight children. The quality of care precipitously declines. It is almost

impossible for the volunteers to guess the ages of the children. Many suffer

such serious developmental delays that they appear and act much younger than

they are. Children who have just been moved are generally placed in the middle

two rows. They are given bottles but scant assistance in feeding, and the

schedule is rigid. Some of the children grab their bottles and eat lustily, and

some--often the same ones--demand attention, crying, spreading their arms to be

held. Their eyes beg for human warmth and affection. Others are already passive

and withdrawn. Their bottles lie untouched, as though they are too weak, too

indifferent, or still too young to make the effort. When feeding time is over,

even the unfinished bottles are collected.<p>



For the most part those who struggle and survive are eventually moved to the

first two rows, although there are no hard and fast rules. When passive

children become weak, they are moved to the last two rows--by whose decision or

according to what criteria, we never learned. In the months that I visited the

orphanage, from October to December of 1994, I never saw the children in these

cribs being fed. Christine, who has been visiting for more than two and a half

years, has sometimes seen the children fed, but has never seen any of them

recover. Rather, she has watched them disappear, to be replaced by new

arrivals.<p>



What Westerners call the dying room is tucked away outside, adjacent to the

place where sick children are tended. Different babies were there each time I

visited, so stiff and quiet, their breathing so faint, that the end could not

have been far. A couple had uncorrected cleft palates. They were not being

tended, nor was there any obvious sign of medical treatment.<p>



Christine has come to accept the deaths. She has to in order to work there. She

visits the dying children each week, taking a mental count, but she never

touches or holds them. She feels that such human contact would be cruel to

children who have never known warmth or affection or holding, and would perhaps

prolong their dying. Instead she gives all her energy and unconditional love to

the little ones who respond to it energetically. She and other volunteers

cuddle and feed and heap copious praise on the children, who light up in their

presence. A Christian-based group also visits weekly, and so do Chinese

students from nearby universities. When I visited, a team of doctors from

Hawaii had recently assisted Chinese physicians in performing surgery on some

of the children, and the pediatrician in charge of the orphanage was soon to

receive several months' training in Hong Kong, where orphanages are

exceptionally well run. The situation in the orphanage, most of the foreigners

seem to agree, is already several times better than when they began

volunteering.<p>



The deaths of helpless children are haunting. We need to know how innocent

babies can deliberately be allowed to die. Since my visits several

expos&eacute;s of Chinese orphanages have received widespread publicity. Last

June the independent British television station Channel 4 ran a documentary

called <A HREF="http://harmony.wit.com/chinascape/china/culture/orphan/index.html">"The Dying Rooms,"</A> filmed by three journalists posing as workers from an

American orphanage. They were graciously welcomed into at least one of the

institutions they visited, as Christine and many other foreign volunteers have

been. Last August, CBS's <i>Eye to Eye<em> </em></i>also ran a segment on

Chinese orphanages, incorporating excerpts from the British program and

interviewing both its producers and Chinese officials. The footage is shocking,

but what it shows is familiar to anyone who has visited the orphanages. Kate

Blewett, one of the producers, is understandably distraught, outraged at what

her investigation unearthed. The Chinese officials do not come off well,

particularly when they deny the existence of what the camera has already

revealed--such as dying rooms. This past January, <A HREF="http://www.catalog.com/fwcfc/hrw.html">Human Rights Watch/Asia</A>

published a lengthy report asserting that thousands of children in Chinese

orphanages have died of starvation and medical neglect. And both Channel 4 and

CBS's <i>60 Minutes</i> have done follow-ups to the latest expos&eacute;.

Again, the Chinese government's response has been defensive and unconvincing.

"Dying rooms do not exist in China," the Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Jian

has asserted. But they do exist. I visited one six times over a period of a few

months. <p>



The official response to all these expos&eacute;s highlights the painful

quandary confronting Americans concerned with human-rights abuses in China. In

the long run public revelations about China's orphanages may encourage the

Chinese government to ameliorate the situation. In the short run, however, the

plight of children already in orphanages may worsen. Since the Human Rights

Watch/Asia report some American would-be parents of Chinese baby girls have

been told to postpone their trips even when the adoption procedures are so far

along that the new families already have pictures of their future daughters.

Some hoping to adopt Chinese babies are afraid that with continuing adverse

publicity China may halt adoptions altogether. Visits by Christine and other

foreign volunteers had been temporarily suspended at the time of this writing,

although they believed that they would be allowed to return soon after the

Chinese New Year, on February 19. <p>



That is why Christine is so reluctant to let me use her real name. "I would be

devastated," she wrote me, "if the result of any of my actions would deny these

children the few pleasures in life they now enjoy." Her concerns are shared by

many foreign volunteers in China, who recognize the world's right to know but

believe that change is best effected on the ground, through quiet cooperation

rather than confrontation. But the expos&eacute;s have demonized China just as

U.S.-China relations are settling into a more troubled period. American public

opinion toward China has typically swung between extremes of admiration and

mistrust, as we project our own hopes and fears on a country we have

consistently misunderstood. China is never as good or as bad as we think it

is.<p>



The foreigners who visit the orphanage every week do not claim to understand

what is happening there. Each has had to come up with her own tentative, often

unsatisfactory explanation and way of coping. Valorie Stackpole, the wife of an

American businessman in China, still wonders about the real value of what she

is doing--whether the few hours of play and nurturing she is able to give the

children each week have any real effect. She questions whether outsiders can or

should try to change a 5,000-year-old culture. Perhaps, she thinks, the visits

are of more benefit to the foreigners, who are trying to help, than to the

Chinese, who have such difficulty accepting our charity. She points out that

the death of a child is never pretty, and urges me to visit the Children's

Hospital in Washington, D.C., where I live. Conditions are modern and sterile

there, but the sight of abandoned babies is no less tragic. Part of the reason

she goes to the orphanage is that she believes her visits serve as a moral

example to the Chinese staff, teaching that even handicapped, abandoned

children deserve nurturing and love.<p>



One woman who was among the first volunteers in the orphanage bristles at the

suggestion that children are being allowed to die. She does not believe it, and

wishes I had not even raised the question. <p>



Bobbie Boudreau, a specialist in child development who taught at the University

of Cincinnati before her husband's job brought her to China, and who is now a

regular visitor to the orphanage, recalls the lessons in detachment she once

taught her college students. How, without detaching, can people whose daily

work is tragedy return home to normal and happy family lives? Perhaps the

apparent indifference of some on the orphanage staff is instinctive detachment,

the preservation of emotion for their own poor and needy families. Boudreau

believes in the value of training.<p>



"Why don't they just kill them?" an American friend who had spent years in Asia

wondered angrily. "We are kinder to our animals. At least we put them out of

their misery."<p>



<font size=5>M</font>Y own search for an explanation has taken months. 

After my initial recoil from

the dying children, I determined to give something to every child on subsequent

visits to the orphanage--to hold and touch each one, and to feed the ones who

could be fed. I stroked the hands and faces of the children who were dying and

prayed that they be taken quickly, without pain, and that China would find a

way to end this needless sacrifice of life. Only one of the dying children

showed any sign of response. "China has too many children," a staff member said

to me bitterly as I stood by the cribs.<p>



I called upon Chinese friends for explanations, wondering whether the deaths

were rooted somewhere in Chinese culture, perhaps in a different conception of

what it means to be fully human. I have never known a Chinese to have moral

qualms about abortion. In the Chinese view, fetuses are not yet human. Families

do not traditionally celebrate a new birth until the baby is a month old.

Historically, infant mortality was high in China, and the child was

particularly at risk during the first month of life. Only when a child was past

the maximum danger point was its arrival noted ceremonially. Too, the family is

all-important in China; identity is embedded there. Perhaps children without

families are denied the right to full humanity.<p>



The pediatrician in charge of the orphanage would not discuss the deaths. The

numbers were confidential, she told me. Chinese friends agreed that the deaths

had cultural roots, and they assumed that the children being allowed to die

were handicapped. Had not the director of the orphanage assured me that the

normal babies were adopted? Burton Pasternak, an anthropologist who has spent

time in Chinese rural areas, has been struck by how successfully people with

Down syndrome and minor handicaps are integrated into village life. But for

years Chinese friends had been telling me that severely handicapped

infants--those with incapacitating infirmities requiring full-time care--are

routinely allowed to die. "Everyone knows that a newborn baby will die after

three days without feeding," one reminded me.<p>



In the Buddhist tradition a severe handicap would be unmistakable evidence of a

heinous crime in a previous life, for which the handicap was punishment.

Better, then, to let the child die and look forward to the next reincarnation.

Its crimes had been expiated. The next life would be better. In the Confucian

tradition a severely handicapped child would be incapable of fulfilling the

immutable demands of filial piety and thus unable to behave as a proper human

being. <p>



A doctor I know, a man of great compassion, reminded me of the history of

political oppression in China. The best of his people have suffered the most

egregious persecution, he pointed out. If the very best are persecuted, does it

not follow that those of so little official worth--the handicapped and

abandoned--should be allowed to die?<p>



My discussions with Chinese friends made clear both the absence of a concept of

equality in Chinese culture and the fact that the handicapped are even lower in

the social hierarchy than girls. But the tragedy of China's orphanages cannot

be fully explained by Chinese culture. My friends assumed that only the

handicapped were being allowed to die, but many of the dying children had no

apparent handicaps, whereas most of the older children did. The children's

handicaps were not the full explanation for why some were being allowed to

die.<p>



At an elegant dinner party in Washington a few weeks after my return I was

seated next to a child psychiatrist. I told him what I had seen. "In a

holocaust or war," he said, "you do not put the best surgeon in the operating

room. You put him at the entrance. His job must be to decide who can be saved

and who cannot. The behavior of the children you describe was so profoundly

autistic that even if by some miracle they were suddenly to receive

twenty-four-hour loving, mothering care, they could not have been saved." The

orphanage was practicing triage. My attempt to offer comfort to the dying had

been more for my benefit than for the children's, he said. They were too

withdrawn to understand.<p>



<font size=5>W</font>HAT is happening in China has parallels in the United States and elsewhere in

the West. The first orphanage in the United States was founded in 1729 by an

Ursuline convent in New Orleans, after an Indian attack left many children

without parents. But the history of our orphanages, and of our treatment of

homeless and indigent children, has not always been commendable. Early in this

century, when systematic research on foundling homes began, investigators

discovered alarmingly high death rates in the first year of the

institutionalized children's lives--71 percent in one of Germany's great

foundling homes, 90 percent in Baltimore, probably 100 percent at the Randall's

Island Hospital, in New York City. Many of the children who lived suffered

devastating physical and psychological damage.<p>



Ren&eacute; A. Spitz, in the mid-1940s, was one of the first to describe what

happened to very young children who spent prolonged periods in institutions

where they had no contact with their mothers. Previously happy and outgoing

children from six to eleven months old became first weepy and then withdrawn,

refusing to take an interest in their surroundings. After three months, Spitz

wrote,<p>



<blockquote>A sort of frozen rigidity of expression appeared instead. These children would

lie or sit with wide-open, expressionless eyes, frozen immobile face, and a

faraway expression as if in a daze, apparently not perceiving what went on in

their environment. . . . Contact with children who arrived at this stage became

increasingly difficult and finally impossible.</blockquote><p>



Many were unable, or refused, to eat. Spitz described the syndrome not as

autism, which experts now believe to have physiological causes unrelated to

maternal care, but as anaclitic depression. In one institution nineteen of 123

children studied suffered severe anaclitic depression, and another twenty-six

exhibited the syndrome in a milder form. <p>



In even the best-equipped facilities and under the most hygienic conditions

children with anaclitic depression are highly susceptible to infection and

illness. Thirty-four of ninety-one children whom Spitz, in one study, observed

in a foundling home over a two-year period died of diseases ranging from

intestinal infections to measles. <p>



Much of what we know today about infants' need for love and stimulation, and

about children's failure to thrive in their absence, can be traced directly to

studies that began in foundling homes. Children are vitally dependent on the

tenderness, affection, and stimulation that we associate with maternal love.

Revelations of what happened to children in Western institutions led to

"child-rescue" movements, the introduction of foster care, and the

establishment of "anti-institutional institutions." Spitz and others found that

up to a certain point the effects of the absence of maternal love are

reversible. The baby's psychic wounds may heal, but only with the addition of

loving, motherly care. In all but exceptional circumstances (and in the United

States the exceptions are increasing--see <A HREF="weisorp.htm">"When Parents Are Not in the Best

Interests of the Child,"</A> July, 1994, <i>Atlantic</i>) the best solution for

children without parents is adoption.<p>



As the movement against the warehousing of children succeeded, and as

institutions themselves improved, psychiatrists were rarely confronted with

children who had never been held or loved, and the term "anaclitic depression"

receded from the psychological literature. But everything about the demeanor of

the dying Chinese children is consistent with Spitz's description of the

progression of profound infant depression. So is the fate of the children.

Shortly after my last visit to the orphanage, as fall was giving way to winter,

Christine returned to discover that sixteen children were gone. She does not

know what happened to them. The history of orphanages in the United States

suggests that even a minor infection could have swept them away.<p>



Western experts were discovering what Spitz described as the "evil effect" of

childhood institutionalization in the mid-1940s, just as the Communists were

coming to power in China. Child psychiatry had not yet developed there, and the

entire psychiatric profession was ultimately discredited under Mao's regime,

which often treated mental illness as a failure of ideological education.

During the Cultural Revolution, when most intellectuals were persecuted and

physicians were sent to the countryside, the fledgling psychiatric profession

was devastated. Only in recent years has it begun to revive. Only in recent

months have I seen references in the Chinese press to a childhood illness

resembling Spitz's anaclitic depression or the autism described by Bruno

Bettelheim and others. The Chinese term means "the syndrome of isolation and

loneliness."<p>



What if ignorance and poverty are primarily responsible for the deaths of

Chinese babies? What if we accept as truth (because it is the truth) the

statement by China's Ministry of Civil Affairs, which is responsible for the

administration of orphanages nationwide, that "China is a developing country

which has 70 million people who still do not have enough to eat or wear, and it

faces many difficulties in raising and educating handicapped children and

orphans"? What if neither the pediatrician in charge of the orphanage nor her

staff have been introduced to the literature on the psychological effects of

institutionalization on infants?<p>



If we accept that the deplorable conditions in China's orphanages result from

both poverty and the past harassment of the psychiatric profession, then

perhaps we can find ways to share with China what we have learned from our own

history of failure to nurture abandoned and orphaned children. Many in China,

including some officials at the Ministry of Civil Affairs, continue to welcome

our cooperation. Chan Kit-ying, a social worker from Hong Kong, has helped

local Ministry of Civil Affairs officials in Nanning, Guanxi; a Nanning

orphanage; and the Hong Kong orphanage Mother's Choice to introduce foster

care, train orphanage staff, and connect the Nanning orphanage with

international adoption agencies. The benefits to the children have been

stunning.<p>



For foreigners to have a lasting effect on the situation in China's orphanages,

more trained people like Chan Kit-ying will have to be willing to work on the

ground, in China, cooperating with Chinese officials and orphanage staff. But

the learning process will be a lengthy one. Chinese orphanages will not improve

overnight. In the meantime, both China and the United States have regularized

the procedures for adoptions. Michael Chang, of the American consulate in

Guangzhou, where immigration permits are issued, reports that adoptions of

Chinese children by U.S. citizens have approximately doubled in the past year,

to about 250 a month, and he expects the number to keep growing. <p>



Within a generation Chinese men will be suffering from a shortage of women to

marry, and little girls will be highly valued. Perhaps by then China will have

had its own movement against the institutionalization of children.

	<i><font size=4>Are some troubled children better suited to institutional care than to 
conventional family settings? If the answer is yes, as many child-care 
experts believe, then the fate of those children may rest on the outcome

	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	
	<font size=5>O</font>rphanages are not what they used to be. They aren't even called 
orphanages anymore. The residents no longer sleep in metal beds, twenty to 
a dormitory room. At the Boys Town campus, just outside Omaha, Nebraska, 
children live eight to a suburban-style home, two to a bedroom. Bureaus 
have replaced lockers. Uniforms and standardized haircuts are gone. So are 
the long wooden tables where, in the orphanages of legend, children sat 
awaiting their portions of cornmeal mush for breakfast, or bread and gravy 
for dinner. For instance, at the former St. James Orphanage, in Duluth, 
Minnesota, known since 1971 as Woodland Hills, young people wearing 
clothes from places like The Gap and Kmart push plastic trays through a 
cafeteria line, choosing baked chicken or shrimp and rice. The weight
conscious detour to the salad bar. <P>
In 1910 some 110,000 orphans lived in 1,200 orphan asylums throughout the 
United States. At the end of 1990, according to data from the American 
Public Welfare Association, there were approximately 406,000 children in 
out-of-home placements. About three quarters of these children were in 
adoptive and foster homes. About 16 percent, or 65,000, were emotionally 
disturbed children in need of therapy, most of whom lived in the group 
homes and residential treatment centers that are the institutional 
descendants of the orphanage. (The remainder, less than 10 percent, were 
cared for by a variety of temporary and emergency services.) What little 
research is available indicates that most of this smaller subset of 
"homeless" children have been physically or sexually abused, often by the 
adults charged with their care. At Boys Town, now a residential treatment 
center--and no longer just for boys--virtually all the girls and nearly 
half the boys have been sexually abused. The director, Father Val J. 
Peter, tells of a teenager who asked him on the day she arrived, "Who do I 
have to sleep with to get along here?"<P>
Child-care workers agree that children in residential treatment today are 
likely to be far more disturbed than the children who were in need of 
protective services twenty years ago and who, in turn, were probably more 
disturbed than the good-hearted orphans with chips on their shoulders who 
preceded them. These kids have had it with parents--biological, adoptive, 
or foster--and the feeling is usually mutual. These kids do not trust 
adults, especially parents. They cannot tolerate the intensity of family 
life, nor do they behave well enough to attend public school. During a 
first screening at a residential treatment center a psychiatrist often 
asks a child, "If you had three wishes, what would they be?" Twenty years 
ago a typical answer was "I want a basketball," or "I wish my father 
didn't drink." Today, according to Nan Dale, the executive director of The 
Children's Village, a residential treatment center for boys in Dobbs 
Ferry, New York, one is likely to hear "I wish I had a gun so I could blow 
my father's head off." Child-care professionals call these young people 
"children of rage." Some of them take antidepressants and drugs to control 
hyperactivity. In addition to the behavior and attachment disorders common 
to children who have been abused and moved around a lot, some suffer from 
having been exposed in utero to crack and some from other neurological 
problems.<P>
Most of the children who live in institutions are between the ages of five 
and eighteen. According to a 1988 study 64 percent of children in 
residential treatment centers were adolescents thirteen to seventeen years 
old. Approximately 31 percent were younger than thirteen, a percentage 
that has been increasing. According to the same study, the majority, about 
70 percent, were male, a factor attributed to the more aggressive nature 
of the sex. Approximately 25 percent of the children were black, and eight 
percent were Hispanic.<P>
A group home may house as few as four children, whereas a residential 
treatment center may be home to a hundred or more, although in either 
facility usually no more than eight to twelve are housed together, 
supervised by house parents or by child-care personnel working eight-hour 
shifts. At Woodland Hills an old three-story red-brick orphanage building has been renovated so that the first 
floor can be used for administration, classrooms, and the cafeteria. The 
second- and third-floor dormitory rooms have been divided into meeting 
rooms, staff offices, and apartments with bedrooms that sleep two.<P>
Unlike the orphanages from which they are descended, most group homes and 
residential treatment centers are not meant to be long-term abodes. A 
typical stay at such a center lasts from several months to two years, 
after which most children return to their birth, foster, or adoptive 
families. A significant minority, those who either have no homes to return 
to or do not wish to go home, move on to less restrictive group homes or 
to independent living arrangements, also under the aegis of the 
child-welfare system.<P><br>
<b>History</b><P>
The first orphan asylum in the United States was established in 1729 by 
Ursuline nuns, to care for children orphaned by an Indian massacre at 
Natchez, Mississippi. Thereafter the number of orphanages increased in 
response to wars, especially the Civil War, and to epidemics of 
tuberculosis, cholera, yellow fever, and influenza. (Contemporary 
epidemics such as AIDS, the resurgence of tuberculosis, and the rampant 
use of crack cocaine have the potential to create another orphan crisis in 
the twenty-first century. By the year 2000, it is estimated, 100,000 
children, most of them from female-headed households, will lose their 
mother to AIDS. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, among others, foresees 
the return of the orphanage as inevitable.)<P>
In spite of the Dickensian reputation that outlives them, orphanages, 
which began to proliferate in this country in the mid-1800s, represented a 
significant social reform for their time, just as the group homes and 
residential treatment centers that took their place are now seen as 
reforms. Before orphan asylums were common, orphaned, homeless, and 
neglected children, if they were not living, stealing, and begging on the 
streets, were housed, along with adults, primarily in almshouses, but also 
in workhouses and jails. The Victorian conviction that childhood was a 
time of innocence influenced attitudes toward destitute children. People 
came to believe that even street urchins could be rescued--removed to a 
better environment and turned into productive citizens.<p>
Most orphanages were private institutions, the result of the combined 
efforts of passionately committed "child savers," children's-aid 
societies, and a variety of mostly religious but also ethnic organizations 
that raised the money to build and maintain them. But even as the 
orphanage was becoming the nation's dominant mode of substitute child 
care, an anti-institutional effort called "placing out" was under way, 
setting the stage for a debate that continues to this day. By the 
mid-1800s children were being transported on "orphan trains" from crowded 
eastern slums and institutions to the West, where they were adopted by 
farm families in need of extra hands. By the late nineteenth century, in a 
further move away from institutionalization, cottage-style "homes," which 
more closely mimicked family life and each of which housed about 
twenty-five children, began to take the place of large orphanages.<P>
In the twentieth century, psychology--first psychoanalytic theories and 
then behaviorism--has dominated the field of child welfare. Unlike 
psychoanalytic theories, which focus on the child's inner personality, 
behaviorism emphasizes the way the child interacts with his world. In this 
view a child is not "bad"; his unacceptable behavior is. By changing the 
behavior, so the thinking goes, one changes the child. Behavioral theories 
replaced psychoanalytic theories, which were used only to limited effect 
by Bruno Bettelheim and others in the "homes" and "schools" for 
emotionally disturbed children which appeared mid-century. The therapeutic 
hour remains important, but what goes on in the child's life during the 
other twenty-three hours of the day is seen as potentially even more 
valuable. (A book by that name, The Other 23 Hours, by Albert E. 
Trieschman, James K. Whittaker, and Larry K. Brendtro, is the classic text 
of residential treatment.) The goal of residential treatment is to create 
a "therapeutic milieu," an environment in which everyday events are turned 
to therapeutic use. Any activity in a child's day--from refusing to get dressed in the morning to answering a question 
correctly at school to picking a fight--offers the child-care worker an 
opportunity to teach, change, or reinforce behavior through therapeutic 
intervention. Residential treatment aims to seize the moment while it is 
happening and the child's feelings are still fresh.<P><br>
<b>Policy versus Reality</b><P>
Orphanages as such had virtually disappeared by the late 1970s as a result 
of a decrease in the number of orphans and a growing conviction that 
children belong in families. That every child needs parents and a home has 
become an article of faith and a guiding principle for social-policy 
makers and a matter of federal law as well. The philosophy of "permanency 
planning," as set forth in the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act 
of 1980, considers the goal of the foster-care system to be keeping 
children in families. The law allows for but discourages "out-of-home 
placement" --institutionalization in group homes or residential treatment 
centers--and calls for the return of the children to a family, biological or 
otherwise, whenever possible and as quickly as possible. But for many 
practitioners in residential treatment the law has become increasingly 
irrelevant.<P>
Richard Small is the director of The Walker Home and School, in Needham, 
Massachusetts, a residential and day treatment center for severely 
disturbed pre-adolescent boys. Writing recently in a professional journal with Kevin 
Kennedy and Barbara Bender, Small expressed a concern shared by many of 
his colleagues. "For at least the past decade, we in the field have been 
reporting, usually to each other, a worsening struggle to work with a much 
more damaged group of children and families, and a scramble to adjust our 
practice methods to meet both client needs and policy directives that may 
or may not have anything to do with client needs. . . . Those of us 
immersed in everyday residential treatment practice see these same 
guidelines as less and less applicable to the real children and families 
with whom we work. Many of our child clients and their families suffer 
from profound disruptions of development that we believe are likely to 
require long-term, multiple helping services, including (but not limited 
to) one or more time-limited stays in residential treatment. Despite a 
policy that seems to see clear boundaries between being "in care" (and 
therefore sick and vulnerable) and "reunified" (and therefore fixed and 
safe) our experience tells us that many of our clients are likely to live 
out their lives somewhere between these poles."<p>

In keeping with the goal of permanency planning, institutions are supposed 
to maintain close communication with the parents of the children they 
treat. Many centers offer counseling for parents and for the entire 
family. The Children's Village runs evening and weekend programs 
especially for parents who have abused their children. At institutions 
that adhere most closely to the goal of reuniting parent and child, 
parents are encouraged to visit, and good behavior on the part of children 
is rewarded with weekend visits home. Green Chimneys, a residential 
treatment center that serves primarily inner-city kids, regularly 
transports parents and children in vans between New York City and its 
campus in Brewster, New York. Nationally, nobody really knows how many 
families are reunited, for how long or how successfully. Those who work 
with children in institutions complain that the pressure from departments 
of social service to reunite parent and child is so intense that the 
workers sometimes yield to it despite their better judgment.<P>
The objective of residential care is to discharge healthier children into 
the care of healthier parents--an outcome that authorities agree is 
desirable in theory but not always likely in fact. In their recent 
casebook for child-care workers, When Home Is No Haven, Albert J. Solnit, 
Barbara Nordhaus, and Ruth Lord write that "one of the hardest tasks for a 
new worker is becoming reconciled to the inherent contradictions in the 
Protective Services worker's role. The worker is expected to aim for two 
goals, which in some instances may be mutually exclusive: reunification of 
the family, and protection of the child and the child's best interests."<P><br>
<b>The Villages</b><P>
Modern children who fall from the grace of their biological parents find 
themselves in what is known in welfare vernacular as the child-care 
continuum. Viewed simplistically, the continuum is a sequence of possible 
living situations, starting with the most homelike (adoptive and foster 
homes) and ending with the most institutional (residential treatment 
centers and psychiatric hospitals). Group homes, some for developmentally 
disabled children and others for dependent and neglected children, occupy 
the middle of the continuum. Generally speaking, children in group homes 
are less emotionally disturbed than those in residential treatment, but 
the continuum is far more complex and the boundaries between one option 
and another more porous than this description implies. For instance, 
children who are sufficiently emotionally disturbed to qualify for 
residential treatment are sometimes cared for in group homes.<P>
In its desire to find a safe, loving, permanent home for every child, the 
system often becomes an unwitting abuser. The saga of Wendy, seventeen 
years old and living in The Villages in Topeka, Kansas, demonstrates the 
destructive potential inherent in the pursuit of permanence. Her 
experience at The Villages also illustrates a long-term institutional alternative for rearing some troubled children for whom 
parents may not be possible or desirable. (The names of children and some 
adults, along with a few insignificant details, have been changed, in 
order to protect the privacy of the children and their families.)<P>
The Villages was founded by Karl Menninger in 1964, in response to 
homelessness, and now includes eleven group homes in Indiana along with 
the original eight in Kansas. (Menninger was one of the founders of the 
Menninger Clinic, which has no business relationship with The Villages.) 
The Villages is a nonprofit institution. Length of stay at The Villages is 
more open-ended than the two-year period prescribed at most residential 
treatment centers, as evidenced by the exceptional case of one young man 
who has been there since 1986. On the average, children spend about two 
and a half years at The Villages, although about 10 percent stay from 
three to five years.<P>
Wendy was one of six children, no two fathered by the same man. "My 
mother," Wendy says, "was a slut." After their mother abandoned them, when 
Wendy was six years old, the state placed each of the children in a 
different foster home. Wendy was removed from her first foster home a year 
later, after being sexually abused by the older boys in the family. 
Because no new foster home was readily available, she was sent to a locked 
facility for juvenile delinquents, where the youngest inmate was fourteen 
years old. Two months later she was transferred to a foster home, where 
she lived for two months, until she returned from grade school one 
afternoon to find that her foster parents had moved, leaving no forwarding 
address. She moved in with one of her schoolteachers temporarily until 
another foster home could be found. This home, Wendy says, "was great," 
but the mother died and Wendy was transferred to yet another home. "It was 
pretty fun," Wendy says. "We lived on a farm."<P>
At this juncture Wendy's mother turned up and asked to be reunited with 
her children, an experiment that was declared a failure within a year, 
whereupon Wendy was sent on to more foster homes and more sexual abuse. 
Wendy was placed at The Villages for the first time at the age of twelve. 
She remained there for three years, until an adoptive home was found. "The 
father tried to make it work, but the mother was never home," Wendy says. 
"She wanted me to clean. She wanted me to dress fancy. We had lots of 
verbal clashes."<P>
A second attempt to find her an adoptive family failed when Wendy began 
surreptitiously to hit the couple's two-year-old baby. By that time Wendy 
was using knives and other sharp objects to make shallow cuts on the 
insides of her wrists--a behavior so common among abused children that 
those who engage in it have a name for themselves: "carvers." Wendy was 
sent to a psychiatric hospital for two months and then returned to the 
second adoptive home, where she again abused the baby. "I was afraid of 
getting too close," Wendy says. "I started trying to make things not 
work."<P>
When Wendy was fourteen, child-welfare workers decided that she should 
spend some more time at The Villages before efforts were made to place her 
with another family. The day Wendy arrived, one of the house parents 
tempted the reluctant fourteen-year-old over the threshold with milk and 
cookies.<P>
Once inside, Wendy set about reassuring herself about her most urgent 
concern: in this house of milk and cookies would she be safe from sexual 
abuse? "Is there a father in this house?" she asked one of the girls who'd 
been living there for several months. When she got yes for an answer, 
Wendy asked a second question: "Does the mother always believe him?"<P>
Karl Menninger was convinced that a permanent home was the best therapy 
for troubled children. The job of house parent requires no training in 
advance, but by law house parents must attend at least thirty hours of 
professional workshops each year. The youngsters in The Villages seem to 
be kept on an even keel with such old-fashioned standards as church attendance, daily chores, clean rooms, neat 
dress, set bed times, and obedience to adults without fussing, plus, for 
some, the modest use of modern psychotropic medications and weekly visits 
to a therapist in the community. The Villages cares for many children who 
might otherwise be in residential treatment centers.<P>
"The essence of therapy at The Villages is paradoxical: it's therapeutic, 
but you should not feel as if you're in a treatment program--the family is 
the treatment," says Don Harris, who until recently served as acting 
director of The Villages. "Some children are too problematic to fit into 
this setting. The Villages is not a place for violent children or those 
who have been so badly turned off parents that they don't want to 
connect." Weekly private visits between children and their social workers 
provide a check against abuse from house parents, in addition to another 
positive relationship with an adult.<P>
Married couples preside over all but one of the homes. The exception, a 
household of adolescent girls, is headed by a single parent, a woman. 
Depending on the talents and interests of the house parents, each 
household encourages different kinds of family activities. Some households 
take their children to the symphony and stage family skits and musicals. 
Other households emphasize sports, or arts and crafts. The children attend 
public school in the community, although they tend to have more friends at 
home than among their schoolmates.<P>
After two years Wendy's emotional health has improved dramatically. She 
has become very attached to the house mother and is a "big sister" to the 
other boys and girls in the household, who range in age from ten to 
seventeen. Wendy has done increasingly well in the public high school and 
plans to attend the University of Kansas. State child-welfare authorities, 
taking note of her progress, want to move her to an adoptive or foster 
home, but Wendy has her own ideas on the subject and doesn't want to go. 
"I was always told that when I got my act together, they'd leave me in one 
place," she says. "I finally did get it together, and now they turn around 
and say, 'Well, you're too good to stay here. We need to move you again.'" 
The State of Kansas spends about $19,000 a year to keep Wendy at The 
Villages. (The real cost is $26,000, but the difference is made up by 
private donations.) Family foster care in Kansas costs the state about 
$4,500 annually per child.<P><br>
<b>Money</b><P>
Nan Dale, of The Children's Village, speaks for many others who believe 
that money, and not the needs of the children, drives the child-welfare 
system. "You've got to ask, after the second or third or fourth 
foster-care failure, when the child has set a fire, cut the cat's tail 
off, and attempted suicide, how come nobody has said, 'This kid needs 
treatment and not just another foster home'?" The fact that for the most 
part residential treatment receives its money from the same source as less 
expensive foster-home care does nothing to improve its image or encourage 
its use. In New York state, for example, where all forms of child care are 
especially costly, "regular" foster care costs about $39 a day per child. 
"Therapeutic" foster care, for which parents are trained and paid extra to 
deal with difficult children, costs $92. Stays in group homes cost $130 a 
day per child, residential treatment costs $135, and a day in a 
psychiatric hospital costs $800. Because psychiatric hospitals tend to 
keep children only long enough to diagnose and stabilize them--usually 
before sending them on to residential treatment centers, where they may 
stay up to two years--long-term residential treatment takes most of the fiscal heat. "No one sends a 
kid directly to an institution," says Sam B. Ross Jr., the founder and 
executive director of Green Chimneys. "You have to try everything else 
first. We don't do things by choice. We do things by finances. If you had 
funds, you would not let what happens to these children happen to your 
child."<p>

In addition to the administrative and maintenance costs associated with 
any institution, $135 a day reflects the costs of room, board, clothing, 
round-the-clock therapy, medical and dental care, and recreational and 
cultural programs. Children who enter residential treatment are typically 
up to three years below grade level. Many have severe learning problems as 
well as behavioral ones. At The Children's Village, for instance, a local 
school district operates a special-education program for kids with 
emotional, behavioral, and learning problems. The student-teacher ratio is 
six boys to one teacher and an aide. Even though food for the 315 boys at 
The Children's Village is bought at bulk rates, it costs about $5 a day 
for the younger children and $8 for adolescents. Annual clothing costs for 
the younger children are about $500, and for adolescents about $1,000, 
including an outfit for Sunday best.<P>
Money flows into residential treatment from a variety of federal, state, 
local, and private sources, and the amount any agency gets depends on a 
number of factors, including how assiduously and creatively it works the 
system. At the federal level the Department of Health and Human Services 
and sometimes the Department of Justice appropriate money to the states. 
Licensing, required in order to qualify for federal funds, is up to the 
individual states. States match federal money using formulas that vary 
from state to state. The states then reappropriate the funds to the 
agencies that provide the care. The agencies are about evenly divided 
between public and private. Money at the local level most often comes from 
private sources such as churches and the United Way.<P>
The children who enter the child-welfare system are almost always from the 
bottom of the socioeconomic ladder and therefore at the mercy of 
bureaucrats, policymakers, social workers, and judges. Where do people 
with money send their emotionally disturbed children when they can no 
longer tolerate them at home? If they don't ship them off to a tough uncle 
who owns a dude ranch in Colorado, or check them into a psychiatric 
hospital, chances are they enroll them in boarding schools described in 
their brochures as suitable "for the child who has special educational and 
emotional needs." The cost? About $36,000 a year, the price of many 
residential treatment centers and group homes, although private boarding 
schools do not pay for a student's clothing, medical and dental treatment, 
vocational training, or other extracurricular needs. Private boarding 
schools also carry no social stigma.<P>
In the postscript to her memoir, Orphans: Real and Imaginary, Eileen 
Simpson writes about learning as an adult that the convent boarding school 
of her childhood, the Villa, was actually an orphanage. She was grateful 
for the deception, because the truth would have been "a heavy burden to me 
as a child," she says. "As an adult, it would have interfered with my view 
of myself as having been lucky. An orphan who goes to an orphanage is far 
more orphaned than one who goes to a convent boarding school."<P>
"Institutionalism is in the eye of the beholder," Lois Forer, a former 
judge of the state Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, and the author 
of books and articles about children and the court system, said before her 
recent death. "Call residential treatment centers boarding schools." Forer 
observed that even the word "institution" can take on a very positive 
connotation when the right people are in residence. "The tubercular rich 
were sure having a high old time on the Magic Mountain," she said, "while 
the poor were in the slums coughing their lungs out."<P><br>
<b>Institutional Family Values</b><P>
In the paradoxical world of "child protective services," an institution 
may be the first home some children have ever known, providing their first 
chance to sit down to meals with other people at regular times, blow out 
birthday candles, and be taken care of by adults who do not hit or even 
yell. All but one of the staple ingredients of a happy home life are 
replicated in the best group homes and treatment centers. Intimacy is 
purposely missing. Love and family bonding may be what these children will 
need and be capable of having eventually, but for the moment the emotional 
thermostat must be set at neutral. These children are believed to be too 
disturbed to handle the intensity of real family life; that is precisely 
why they have been institutionalized.<P>
The best institutions offer emotionally disturbed children a chance at a 
second childhood. They are given the opportunity to shed cynicism, develop 
self-esteem, and grow back into innocence and vulnerability. Candy will 
become a treat. This time they will be protected from harm. This time they 
will come to think of adults as kind and dependable. They will learn to 
play. They will learn to care about others.<P>
Treatment communities teach Judeo-Christian values--the work ethic and the 
golden rule. Institutions offer vocational training and courses in 
computer literacy. At The Children's Village the best computer students 
teach their newfound skills to other children and adults in the 
surrounding communities, and The Children's Village has its own Boy Scout 
troop. The kids at Woodland Hills collect and pack supplies for national 
and international relief efforts. In addition, they split wood and deliver 
logs to the elderly in the Duluth community. Boys Town children host 
Special Olympics games.<P>
A highly controlled environment is required to create a second childhood 
for severely disturbed children. Safety is the key issue. Keeping these 
children from harm involves more than keeping them safe from sexual abuse, 
physical abuse, drugs, and crossfire; they must be kept safe from 
themselves and their peers. Newly institutionalized children often try to 
run away. When a young person at Woodland Hills forgets to bring the 
appropriate book to class, two peers accompany the student back to the 
dormitory to retrieve it, thereby minimizing the possibility of an escape 
attempt. At The Children's Village burly guards equipped with 
walkie-talkies and trained in firm but gentle techniques of physical 
restraint stand ready to intervene should fights or tantrums develop 
beyond the regular staff's ability to control them. Children are never 
left unattended, not even when they sleep. In every one of the twenty-one 
cottages at The Children's Village one staff member remains awake 
throughout the night. The children in these cottages are sometimes 
suicidal. The bedroom doors in all the cottages open into the corridor, so 
that youngsters cannot barricade themselves in their rooms. Sexually 
abused children sometimes become sexual predators. At The Villages in 
Kansas some young girls will not allow anyone to comb their hair; for 
girls who have been sexually abused, even grooming can be too 
threatening.<P>
This antidotal second childhood must be highly structured and predictable 
as well as safe. Treatment communities impose rules, chores, and 
schedules, and emphasize neatness, cleanliness, and order. "Everybody 
wakes up at 7:30 in the morning," writes eleven-year-old Robert, 
describing his day at The Children's Village, where hairbrushes, combs, 
toothbrushes, and toothpaste tubes are lined up with military precision on 
bureau tops. "The first thing we do is make our bed, wash our face, brush 
our teeth, last but not least put on some clothes. We eat our breakfast by 
8:15 and do our chores. At 8:45 we go to school. In school the first thing 
we do is math, then reading and spelling. We go to lunch at 12:00 noon. . 
. ." Homer, the orphan hero of John Irving's The Cider House Rules, 
thrives on the routine of orphanage life. He enjoys "the tramp, tramp of 
it, the utter predictability of it." "An orphan," Irving writes, "is 
simply more of a child than other children in that essential appreciation 
of the things that happen daily, on schedule." A well-structured day 
serves the child as a kind of armature within which to build a new, less 
chaotic, inner self. "How to succeed and how to fail is very clear here," 
says Daniel Daly, the director of research at Boys Town. "These children 
are looking for consistency and for an environment they can understand."<P>
Often institutions for children, like religions, have their own belief 
systems. What the faith is may not matter as much as its function as an 
organizing principle for its adherents. At The Villages the organizing 
principle is a belief in the therapeutic value inherent in family life. 
Woodland Hills is committed to a behavioral model called "positive peer 
culture." Any surrogate who remotely resembles a parent, or any scenario 
that draws its inspiration from a Norman Rockwell dinner-table tableau, is 
presumed anathema to this population of disturbed teenagers. Instead the 
kids confront one another in group therapy, and the staff gambles on its 
ability to turn the potentially destructive power of the peer group into a 
positive force. The Walker School, which adheres to a "cognitive 
behavioral model," has as its article of faith the conviction that every 
child can learn. As a result Walker places an unusually strong emphasis on 
academics, although "learning" at Walker can mean anything from solving 
math problems to practicing sitting still to running in the right 
direction in baseball. Green Chimneys is well known for using animals to 
encourage children to love and trust. Through "farm therapy" children 
learn to be care-givers even if they have not been cared for themselves, 
thereby helping to interrupt the cycle of abuse.<P>
When it was an orphanage, Father Flanagan's Boys Town put its faith in God 
and the work ethic. Now that it's a residential treatment center, it also 
believes devoutly in science and technology. Father Val says, "Boys Town 
has embarked upon a program of basic research in microbehavioral 
analysis," the goal of which is to develop practical, replicable 
techniques for changing the behavior of emotionally disturbed children. 
These techniques are explained in a 250-page manual that is used to train 
the "family teachers" who head up each Boys Town "family." So "micro" is 
the behavioral analysis that the manual breaks down what Boys Town calls a 
"teaching interaction" into nine component parts: initial praise, empathy, 
or affection; description of the inappropriate behavior; consequence; 
description of the appropriate behavior; rationale for (benefits of) 
appropriate behavior; request for acknowledgment; practice of new, 
appropriate behavior; feedback; praise throughout the interaction.<P><br>
<b>Boys Town: The Teaching Family</b><P>
Boys Town is the most complete and controversial realization of the 
prevailing belief that a residential treatment center should look as 
little like an institution and as much like a home as possible. Indeed, 
Boys Town is much more than a happy home; it's a happy village. In fact it 
is a number of happy villages. Boys Town has cloned itself; by next year 
as many as seventeen little Boys Towns will be in operation in several 
states.<p>

"We have a plan to change the way America takes care of her children," 
Father Val says. By saying so he sticks his finger in the eye of the 
child-welfare establishment, which considers Boys Town a bit overzealous, 
too lax in its efforts at family reunion, too independent, and too rich.<P>
With net assets of $514 million, Boys Town is the Abu Dhabi of residential 
treatment centers. The place has its own schools, churches, town hall, 
firehouse, ZIP code, and two Olympic-sized swimming pools. A neighborhood 
of seventy-five variously styled houses, any one of which would sell for 
more than $400,000 in Fairfield County, Connecticut, is tucked behind 
flower gardens on 400 acres of specimen trees and dense, cushy lawns. 
Another 900 acres is farmland under cultivation. A man-made lake is 
stocked with bass and bluegill. Whereas other residential-treatment-center 
campuses have the slightly scruffy appearance common to boarding schools 
with meager endowments, Boys Town has the finely calibrated utopian look 
of an architect's rendering. The brick houses, with their picture windows 
and slate roofs, are set well back on generous lots and are furnished with 
plush wall-to-wall carpeting, Tiffany-style chandeliers, TVs, and Monopoly 
games. Clusters of "family" photographs decorate the walls and are 
displayed on mantelpieces. Bikes are parked in back yards, near handsome 
sets of lawn furniture. For the 100,000 tourists who visit each year, 
never mind the 556 boys and girls who live there (girls were first 
admitted in 1979), Boys Town evokes nostalgia for a Cleaverish community 
and home they probably never knew. The effect is intentional, if a bit 
surreal. All that comfort, all that beauty, all those possessions, says 
Father Val, a great believer in first impressions, send the children a 
message they may never have heard before: "You are valuable."<P>
During dinner at a "family" home in Boys Town butter is requested with a 
smile and a "please" and acknowledged with a "thank you," and the 
presiding "parents," Linda and Geoffrey (not their real names), lavishly 
pass out praise along with the chicken enchiladas, rice, and mixed fruit. 
"I like the way you made eye contact with Judy when you asked for the 
butter," Linda says.<P>
Linda and Geoffrey sit at either end of an oval table. The eight girls 
seated between them, four on each side, are clearly not their natural 
children. They are too close in age--eleven to seventeen--and not all of 
the same race. What they do have in common, besides histories of sexual 
and physical abuse, is a set of learned behaviors that they show off with 
obvious pleasure. These girls greet a stranger with a big smile and a firm 
handshake. They also accept nonstop instruction in how to acknowledge 
criticism and take no for an answer. A child who six months ago would have 
turned the table over rather than respond to a request to set it now 
complies promptly and cheerfully.<P>
Tonight, while the girls are learning table manners good enough for dining 
with Rockefellers, they will also be practicing their problem-solving 
skills. Jasmine, the youngest member of the family, has requested and been 
granted the privilege of presenting the evening's problem. Jasmine is 
nervous. She takes a deep breath and states her case. Jasmine is unhappy 
because her night to help prepare the family dinner is always Thursday, 
which also happens to be leftovers night. This means she never really gets 
a chance to cook.<P>
"That was good, Jasmine, very good," says Linda, maintaining eye contact 
with Jasmine. "You did a good job of stating the problem clearly."<P>
Jasmine smiles and blushes with pleasure. (Because a stranger has joined 
them at the table, tonight's problem and the ensuing discussion are 
trivial and tame. Under normal conditions the problem posed could have 
been "My parents don't care what happens to me." Such a statement might 
have prompted Linda or Geoff to help the child to clarify her problem for 
herself and for the other children: "Did something happen on your visit 
home last weekend?")<P>
"Can you think of a way to solve the problem?" Linda asks Jasmine.<P>
"Well," Jasmine says, "we could make Wednesday leftovers night."<P>
"Good for coming up with a suggestion, Jasmine," Linda says. "That's one 
option. I can see you're really trying to figure this out. Can anyone else 
think of another?"<P>
Over chocolate pie and milk, after a few more options have been raised and 
praised, the group turns to an eager but orderly discussion of the 
disadvantages and advantages of each of the options offered. "Can you 
think of any problems if you do that?" Geoff asks. "Can you think of any 
benefits?"<P>
This is not a Stepford family. Although one might be tempted to see them 
as genial robots, rehearsing therapeutic dialogues from the Boys Town 
manual, they are also having a good time. David Coughlin is the 
second-in-command and the youth-care director at Boys Town. He 
acknowledges that behavioral psychodrama can sometimes look pretty stilted 
and silly, but says that it does only until the children have mastered the 
behavior. In this, their second childhood, these kids have to practice 
being normal. They are conscious that their behavior is being manipulated. 
They choose to play the game. The doors are not locked.<P>
After dinner the girls move to the den, where they record on index cards 
the points they've accumulated throughout the day. Every day is 
parent-teacher-conference and report-card day at Boys Town. Point cards 
from school are carried home and compared with home cards so that everyone 
who works with a child knows how that child is doing. (At The Walker 
School communication and coordination are facilitated by a computer 
network. Throughout the day child-care workers and teachers feed in and 
retrieve information about individual children.) The object of all this 
attention, the child--whom Boys Town calls "the consumer"--also has ready 
access to the files. Some institutionalized kids can tell you exactly how 
many points they have the way some grown-ups can tell you to the dollar 
how much money they've got in the bank. Jasmine may have been awarded 
10,000 points for her dinner-table presentation, but she may also have 
been docked thousands of points in school that day for failing to finish 
her homework. "Behavioral points are a lot like Catholic indulgences," 
Coughlin says. "We've got little sins, big sins, confessions, and plenary 
indulgences."<P>
Points, awarded as flamboyantly as praise, translate into privileges and 
purchasing power. Thirty thousand points entitles a child to listen to a 
story on a cassette tape; a comic book costs 50,000 points. Adding and 
subtracting high numbers adds drama to the game and hones mathematical 
skills.<P><br>
<b>The Problem With Parents</b><P>
When parents treat each other and their children with patience, love, and 
consistency, they are making a "happy home." When child-care workers do 
the same, they are modeling parental behavior and creating a "therapeutic 
milieu." When parents instinctively intervene from dawn to dusk to impart 
information or to comment on or calm a child's behavior, that informal 
activity is called child rearing. When child-care workers do it on a 
twenty-four-hour basis, it's called therapy. The good child-care worker, 
like the good parent, sees every event and encounter in a child's life as 
an opportunity to discourage destructive attitudes and behavior and 
replace them with healthy alternatives. Whatever particular philosophical 
model an institution may follow, all institutions agree that the most 
significant influence for change in a troubled child's life is the 
institutional parent or child-care worker.<P>
Children's institutions must handle the issue of noninstitutional parents 
with the utmost delicacy. To some extent a natural hostility exists 
between parent and institution. Mistreatment by parents is one of the 
reasons that many children end up institutionalized. Nevertheless, the 
institution depends on the cooperation and rehabilitation of the parent to 
effect the ultimately desired family reunion.<P>
Children typically enter a period of mourning when they are placed in a 
treatment center. No one insists upon loyalty to parents more than the 
institutionalized children themselves. In the introduction to Love Is Not 
Enough (1950), a book about his experimental school at the University of 
Chicago, Bruno Bettelheim wrote about a child named Emily who learned to 
handle conflicting loyalties to her parents at home and her counselors at 
school. "Asked what love meant, Emily answered, 'Love means to hug me and 
kiss me and carry me and put me down.' After a pause she added, 'Parents 
do it. Counselors becare you.'"<P>
At The Children's Village a list of house rules written by the boys is 
tacked to a dormitory wall, along with posters of Magic Johnson, Michael 
Jackson, and Malcolm X. "No talking about a peer's parents" is rule No. 1, 
followed by "No stealing," "No lying," "No cursing or fighting," and "No 
damaging property or playing with fire extinguisher."<P>
The eight girls who live with Linda and Geoff at Boys Town do not call 
them Mom and Dad or refer to them as "parents." Most intentionally, Boys 
Town calls the married couples who head up their seventy-five households 
"family teachers," a less intimate and more apt description. Even at The 
Villages, where exposure to healthy family living is the primary therapy, 
ten-year-old Melissa calls her house parents by their first names. 
Melissa, who starved while her parents dined, still clings to a family 
snapshot years after the court severed parental rights. "My parents locked 
me up in a closet and forgot about me," she says. "I miss them."<P>
The critical challenge at Boys Town, as at all institutions for 
emotionally disturbed children, is to provide the child with a remedial 
childhood and remedial parental role models, within a remedial community, 
without challenging the child's loyalty to his real home or parent.<p>

At the swearing-in ceremonies that take place nearly every Friday at Boys 
Town, Father Val is careful to tell the new arrivals, "You don't lose your 
own family, but you gain another family, a bigger family. You become part 
of the Boys Town family." When students gather in the assembly hall at 
Boys Town's Wegner Middle School to recite the Lord's Prayer, salute the 
flag, and sing the national anthem to heavy
handed accompaniment on an upright piano, they stand beneath a large 
computer-generated banner that reads "We Will Not Give Up On You." Even the concept 
of unconditional love--once associated exclusively with parents--has been 
institutionalized.<P>
Institutional parents are too good to be true. They teach but never 
lecture. They praise but never blame. A child who has just thrown a chair 
through the bay window, hurled curses at the family teacher, and then 
slumped down on the sofa will be docked 50,000 points for the chair and 
the bad language, and then given 10,000 points for regaining control. 
"Look! You've already earned back ten thousand points. You'll be out of 
the hole in no time." These parents are upbeat. They are rational. They 
never say "Because I said so." What makes the good ones effective is the 
very fact that they are not real. These kids have already had real 
parents.<P><br>
<b>Woodland Hills: Positive Peer Culture</b><P>
A female black bear is pawing through the Dumpster behind the old 
orphanage building at Woodland Hills. Some of the staff and a few of the 
kids have come out on the driveway to watch. Sixteen-year-old Kate cowers 
with fear, although she is about 300 feet from the bear and just one foot 
away from the back door. Six months ago Kate was a tough gang member. She 
stole a car and drove it through a store window. It was not her first 
offense. The judge gave her a choice between jail and Woodland Hills.<P>
If Boys Town's style is "please" and "thank you," Woodland Hills's is "in 
your face." This is no corporate headquarters for family values; it's boot 
camp for juvenile delinquents. Forty-eight boys and girls, aged thirteen 
to seventeen, pound up and down the three flights of stairs that form the 
crooked spine of the old St. James Orphanage, founded by Catholics in 
1910. The large, stern, Federal-style building, remodeled within to create 
smaller spaces, functions as a school, dormitory, cafeteria, and 
administration building. No attempt has been made to make the place look 
like anyone's home, real or imagined.<P>
"When I got here, my hair was spiked," Kate says. "I was wearing combat 
boots, and my makeup was nasty. I liked my reputation, because nobody 
messed with me." Today she's wearing jeans, a T-shirt, running shoes, and 
no makeup. She proudly points to the pile of wood she has split. Then she 
walks over to a rabbit hutch, unhooks the door, and scoops up a big gray 
rabbit. "There's no drugs here and nothing to sniff," she explains, while 
the rabbit nestles in her arms. (Most of the kids at Woodland Hills have 
been substance abusers.) "They don't let us have anything that has drugs 
in it, like bleach or gas, nothing that we could sniff and get high. We 
got to get trusted even before we can use the lawn mower."<P>
No child-care worker is likely to be able to sell Kate on charm-school 
manners or a point system. Parental role models are out of the question. 
So, one would think, is getting these kids to give up street gangs for 
membership in teams with nerdy names like The Pioneers and The 
Trailblazers. But it's not--not any more so than getting an alcoholic to 
stand up that first time and declare. The power of Alcoholics Anonymous is 
well known, and getting former gang members to help other gang members go 
straight is also possible.<P>
Positive peer culture is based on two simple Judeo-Christian principles: 
anything that hurts any person is wrong, and we are our brothers' keepers. 
The essence of peer culture is helping others. "No matter how troubled a 
person is, it always helps to get him off his ass and go do something for 
someone else," says Richard Quigley, who heads up Woodland Hills. "There's 
plenty else you've got to do for a real troubled person, but caring for 
someone else is the therapeutic ingredient you can't do without." The 
trick is getting these supremely careless children to care, first about 
someone else and then about themselves.<P>
A newcomer to Woodland Hills gets placed in one of several pre-existing 
groups, each having about ten members. Young people of the same age, size, 
sex, and degree of sophistication are put together, although passive or 
aggressive kids are not likely to be concentrated in any one group. Unlike 
the teaching parents at Boys Town, who intervene all day long, correcting 
and reinforcing the behavior of their charges, group leaders at Woodland 
Hills intervene as infrequently as possible in the peer-group process. It is the kids who continually engage one another in 
therapy. Newcomers, who are used to defending their behavior with fists 
and knives, freeze like deer in headlights when veteran peer-group members 
gently ask them, "What are you gaining? What are you losing? Whom are you 
hurting?" Often the delicate balance of a group is upset from within by 
the charismatic presence of a "negative indigenous leader," or NIL in 
psychologists' shorthand. Even then a good group leader will not intervene 
directly. Such recognition by and confrontation with an adult leader would 
only enhance the NIL's status. Instead the adult leader attempts to 
disturb the NIL's social equilibrium by pulling the NIL's victim aside and 
confiding, "Take a look at how that guy is trying to influence you; watch 
how he's trying to get you off track."<P>
"Working with a group is like practicing jujitsu," says David Kern, 
Woodland Hills's program director. "What am I doing? I'm taking your 
weight and your energy and your force, and moving it in the direction that 
you need to go. I'm not in fear of you coming at me. As a matter of fact I 
look forward to it, so that I can direct you."<P>
Practitioners of peer-group therapy speak jujitsu English, using the 
delinquents' own words for and against them. Caring behavior is referred 
to as "strong," "cool," "powerful," and "mature." Hurtful behavior is 
relabeled "cowardly," "weak," and "childish." First you "talk the talk," 
they say at Woodland Hills; then you "walk the walk." If a kid hears and 
sees nothing around him all day for months but male and female group 
leaders modeling both strength and caring, after a while the message 
begins to sink in: "You are valuable."<P>
Unlike most residential treatment programs, in which a stay may last as 
long as two years, the peer-culture program takes just eight months to 
complete. Kate spent the first two weeks at Woodland Hills in a stubborn 
state of resistance known as "casing the joint"--the first of five 
designated states in the peer-group process. "Nobody was going to tell me 
what to do," she says.<P>
The language at Woodland Hills tends to be rough and to the point. At Boys 
Town teaching parents precede each corrective "teaching interaction" with 
an expression of appreciation, praise, or empathy for the child. At 
Woodland Hills group leaders also praise before they correct, but they 
call the procedure "bump and burp."<P>
After she calmed down, Kate was invited to participate in an initiatory 
rite, the recitation of her "life history" before the girls in her peer 
group. Like the rest of them, she had been sexually abused. Like many of 
them, she had received counseling in her community and had lived in two 
foster homes, a therapeutic foster home and a group home, before Woodland 
Hills. Like most of them, she had been cared for by a single parent, her 
mother. Her troubles had started when she was thirteen years old and 
escalated quickly from skipping school to fistfights to drugs to breaking 
and entering to car theft.<P>
Her peers listened to her story and offered their diagnosis, chosen from a 
prepared list of possible "problem labels." "My problem labels are 
'authority,' 'inconsiderate to self,' and 'easily angered,'" Kate 
volunteers, rattling them off like name, rank, and serial number. 
"Inconsiderate to self" is a label applied to anything one does that is 
damaging to the self, such as putting oneself down or resisting help from 
others. In Kate's case the damage is literal. Kate is a carver.<P>
Kate spent the next few weeks in stage two, "testing the limits." She 
refused to get out of bed in the morning. She would not attend school. 
"All I wanted was to get out," she says. She ran away twice. Both times 
staff members went out in the middle of the night to look for her rather 
than call the cops. That display of unconditional institutional love 
impressed her. "I didn't know that people who didn't know you could care 
about you," she says.<P>
Then Kate entered the third, honeymoon stage of peer culture, 
"conformity." She behaved, but only because behaving was the thing to do. 
"I kissed butt" is how she puts it. "She really looked good," David Kern 
says, "but she still wasn't buying into the reason for behaving; she still 
didn't believe that she, or anyone else, was worthwhile."<P>
Now Kate is in stage four, "value conflict." It's the critical stage. She 
wants to try the new way--to move on to the final stage, "change"--but the 
old way comes so much more easily. "I've got a lot of anger built up," she 
says. "I'm like a volcano or a time bomb. When I get angry, my old values 
come back. I, like, turn over."<P>
Kate turned over in a big way at a group meeting when she got the news 
that the staff had decided not to grant her request for a weekend pass to 
visit her mother. She had carved on herself just a week earlier. They 
didn't think she was ready for a home visit. When her two best friends in 
the group tried to comfort her, she turned her fury against them, zapping 
them with exquisitely customized racial and sexual insults, making crude 
references to Peg's preference for black men and calling the promiscuous 
Georgia a "whore."<P>
Today, after bullying the group for a week with silence, Kate, in classic 
peer-culture tradition, has asked for and been awarded a meeting of which 
she will be the subject.<P>
"You built up all that trust with Peg and Georgia," a girl named Jane 
tells her, "and then you destroyed it in five minutes. Was it worth it?"<P>
"My brother used to call me a whore," Georgia says. "You knew that."<P>
"You shouldn't tell me stuff, 'cause when I get pissed off, I'll use it," 
Kate says, pulling a tissue from the box on the floor at her feet and 
wiping her tears.<P>
"What would have happened if you'd let Peg and Georgia in?" another girl, 
Theresa, asks.<P>
"I've tried before, and I've gotten hurt," Kate says. She kicks the tissue 
box toward Georgia. Georgia yanks out a tissue and blows her nose.<P>
"She's vulnerable," Peg says.<P>
"So it's 'I'll get you before you get me,'" says Lucie, the group leader. 
"Who else does that?"<P>
"I do it, big time," Peg says.<P>
"What's it gonna take," Georgia says, "to get you to start doing something 
for yourself?"<p>

Kate doesn't answer. She just looks at her shoes.<P>
"Kate," Jane says, with some frustration, "we're trying to care about 
you."<P>
The meeting goes on like this for an hour and a half, until Lucie brings 
it to an end by complimenting the quality of the help given to Kate by her 
peers. She also credits Kate for working hard.<P>
The questions asked of Kate are more important than the answers she gives. 
"A lot of people miss the point," Kern says. "The most important thing 
that goes on in a meeting is not whatever changes may or may not take 
place in the person who's getting help; it's the changes in the 
self-concepts of the nine people who are giving it. They deal with their 
own problems as they see them more sympathetically projected onto the 
youth who is the subject of the meeting."<BR>
Even so, Kate seems to have benefited from the meeting. "This place is 
really caring," she says. "They were crying because they were feeling 
empathy for me. They stuck to me like glue."<P><br>
<b>Are Institutions Successful?</b><P>
"It doesn't matter that a kid behaves well in front of you in a 
residential treatment center," says Earl Stuck, the director of 
residential services for the Child Welfare League of America. "We've only 
begun to use the power of residential treatment when we use it to help 
kids apart from their families. The real power of the tool is in figuring 
out ways to create the same kinds of change in families." What counts is 
what happens to children like Kate after they leave the cocoon of the 
institution and try to get along in the real world. Kate hopes that if she 
makes it through all five stages of the peer-culture program, she can go 
on to a career in the Army. That would be a resounding success. (Military 
service is a frequently chosen career among institutionalized young 
people, who find the continuation of a highly structured life appealing. 
Twenty years ago a career in the armed services was a more realistic goal. 
Today, because many of these young people are more disturbed, the military 
is out of reach for a lot of "graduates.")<P>
Very little solid research is available on the subject of whether or not 
institutionalizing children does them any lasting good. Researchers and 
child-care experts say that this lack of public accountability is due to a 
shortage of funds for research, which existed especially during the Reagan 
and Bush years. Indeed, experts disagree widely about what the criteria of 
success might be, let alone to what extent success may be achieved. 
Nevertheless, Stuck estimates that most residential programs do a good 
job. But Ira M. Schwartz, the dean of the University of Pennsylvania 
School of Social Work, discounts all claims of institutional success. Any 
studies conducted without a control group he calls "unsound." Even those 
few studies that have used control groups, he insists, are suspect and 
inconclusive: "No credible evidence shows that institutions are more 
effective than other, less expensive options."<P>
Since 1964 American child-care institutions have been living uneasily with 
the good-news, bad-news results of a highly respected research project 
known as the Cleveland Bellefaire follow-up study. The bad news is that 
the benefits of residential treatment tend not to last once a child 
returns to society. Samuel Kelman, the present director of Bellefaire, 
which has a residential treatment center, doesn't think the bad news is 
altogether bad. "If a guy breaks his arm, and the doctor sets it, and the 
guy breaks his arm again, do you say the original intervention was not 
successful?" The good news, which attracted less attention at the time the 
results of the study were reported, is that institutions could improve 
success rates by working more closely with parents and with the community 
into which the child was being released.<P>
Kelman takes the positive and negative findings of the Bellefaire study 
seriously. "We try to make the life experience of the kids while they are 
in our program conducive to learning what they are going to need to do 
when they leave the program. We teach them how to negotiate the system. We 
teach vocational skills, problem solving, and how to manage money. We do a 
lot of group work and give them a lot of feedback. Bellefaire is very 
aggressive about parent involvement. Our goal is to try to help them to 
increase their responsibility for rearing their own children. We plan home 
visits; we involve parents in decision-making while their kids are still 
in the program. But partly what we have is an attitude that we hope 
reflects respect for parents." A Bellefaire study completed in 1990 showed 
that 78 percent of children followed were still living at home three years 
after leaving treatment. Seventy-six percent were working or in school.<P>
"Success" is defined modestly, even by those who run what are considered 
to be among the best residential programs in the country. Many, like 
Woodland Hills, gauge success in terms of recidivism. Eighty percent of 
the 160 young people who graduated from its peer program from 1989 to 1991 
were not sent to other institutions during the year following their 
release. One year, David Kern says, is a reliable indicator of future 
success.<P>
"When I was a kid," Sam Ross, the executive director of Green Chimneys, 
says, "my teachers used to say to me, 'If you don't pay attention, you're 
going to end up being a truck driver or a garbage collector.' Now I pray 
each night that my children will end up being truck drivers or garbage 
collectors." Ross has no studies to prove that Green Chimneys's program is 
successful, but he has confidence in his own informal research techniques. 
He compares the numbers of grateful alumni who attend annual reunions with 
the number of requests for records he receives from community agencies, 
indicating that one of his graduates is in jail or other serious trouble, 
and he comes up with a positive assessment.<P>
In 1984, with funding from an anonymous grant, The Children's Village 
initiated a pilot scholarship program called the W-A-Y (Work Appreciation 
for Youth). To qualify, boys had to have been at The Children's Village 
for at least six months and be able to read at a third-grade level. In the 
same year researchers established a comparison group composed of equally 
qualified students from The Children's Village who would not participate 
in the scholarship program but would follow some less intensive course. To 
date 155 children have participated in the W-A-Y program. Participants 
must prove their mettle by performing nonsalaried chores and community 
service before moving on to salaried jobs on the campus, such as working 
on the gardening crew or at the Village Store. As the kids progress from 
chores to real jobs, they are taught to fill out job applications, 
negotiate salaries, conduct interviews, and accept criticism, and become 
subject to real-life consequences, such as being fired, for poor 
performance. In the final stages of the program, participants enter into a 
contract with The Children's Village--and with their parents, too, if they 
are available--in which the young person agrees to work part-time and save 
a percentage of earnings for a college education or job training. Savings 
are matched by private donors. Evaluations of the W-A-Y program made in 
1993 indicate success. Twice as many scholarship students as young people 
in the comparison group had either graduated from high school or earned 
their high school equivalency degree. The dropout rate among scholarship 
students was 13 percent as opposed to 33 percent in the other group. For 
purposes of comparison (if severely emotionally disturbed children can be 
compared with children in the general population), the New York City 
public high school dropout rate from 1988 to 1992 was 16.2 percent.<P>
In 1990 Boys Town concluded a longitudinal study that had begun in 1981, 
comparing the attitudes toward education and the attainments of a group of 
residents with those of a sample group of young people who had applied to 
Boys Town but did not attend. Among other findings, which included that 
the Boys Town residents estimated more highly both the importance of going 
to college and their own potential to complete college, the study 
demonstrated that the Boys Town kids did better academically and were far 
more likely to graduate from high school than the sample group.<P><br>
<b>Paradigms and Politics</b><P>
Two years ago legislation called the Family Preservation Act was vetoed by 
President George Bush. The bill asked for about $2 billion to strengthen 
families. About half of that amount was earmarked for "family 
preservation"--programs to preserve troubled families before they broke 
up, so that fewer children would enter the foster-care system in the first place. Families in crisis would be assigned a 
licensed social worker, who would be available to them around the clock 
for a period of about three months, for help with problems ranging from 
substance abuse to landlord-tenant relations. Parents in imminent danger 
of abusing their children could find relief in a "respite program." Last 
year's budget legislation provided $1 billion for similar purposes, with a 
substantial portion also to be spent on family preservation. It had the 
backing of leading child-advocacy groups, including the Child Welfare 
League of America, the Children's Defense Fund, and The National 
Association of Homes and Services for Children. The Edna McConnell Clark 
Foundation has produced media kits claiming that family-preservation 
programs cost less per family ($3,000 for one family for a year) than 
family foster care, which it says costs $10,000 per child, or 
institutional care, which costs $40,000 per child.<P>
Directors of some children's institutions are convinced that "family 
preservation" will take money directly out of institutional pockets. Sam 
Ross likes to point out that the family, theoretically the best way to 
rear children, also happens to be the least expensive. He calls this 
coincidence good news for advocates of family preservation, whom he calls 
"the liberal-conservative conspiracy." The way Ross sees it, liberal 
family preservationists believe that residential treatment centers are 
warehouses for children who could best be served in homes in their own 
communities. Conservative preservationists are horrified by the cost of 
residential treatment and are looking for a cheaper alternative. "For once 
in their lives," Ross says, "they agree on something: let's get rid of 
residential treatment."<P>
"It makes about as much sense as closing down emergency rooms and intensive
care units in order to lower hospital costs," says Brenda Nordlinger, the 
executive director of the National Association of Homes and Services for 
Children.<P>
"Family preservation? Who can be opposed to that?" says David Coughlin, of 
Boys Town. "But," he warns, "some kids are going to be in trouble all 
their lives. These kids are always going to need help. You can't just blow 
across the top of a family for three months and expect their woes to go 
away."<P>
As of this year The Villages in Kansas will be responding to pressure from 
the state, which provides 78 percent of its operating expenses, to 
institute a family-preservation program in addition to its group-foster-care program. One of 
the eight Kansas residences will be rededicated as a ninety-day "home away 
from home" for abused children. Meanwhile, therapists trained by The 
Villages will work with the abusing parents and the abused children in an 
effort to reunite the family. "We want to provide the services that the 
state wants to purchase. We'd be foolish not to," says Mark Brewer, who 
has been the executive director since last June.<P>
Nan Dale, of The Children's Village, thinks that the fervor to reduce the 
numbers of children in residential treatment is reminiscent of what is now 
generally considered the disastrous policy of de-institutionalizing adult 
mental patients in the 1970s. Program directors are very skeptical about 
whether preventive-intervention programs are really as successful as their 
advocates claim. Those who believe that family preservation is being 
oversold see an ally in John Schuerman, a professor of social work at the 
University of Chicago. Schuerman has studied preventive
intervention programs and believes that many of the families that were 
treated and did not split up were not likely to split up in the first 
place.<P>
Nan Dale is feeling the anti-institutional heat and resenting it. "We're 
as pro-family a place as you can find. The fact that we serve a child who 
has been removed from a family does not make us anti-family. We involve 
parents." Nevertheless, she says, "the lines have been drawn. When the 
words 'preventive service' got applied to everything up to the doorstep of 
residential care, some of us had apoplectic fits. We all would have told 
you that what we did here was preventive. We prevent lifetimes in mental 
hospitals, lifetimes in prisons. All of a sudden some bureaucrat in 
Washington defines preventive service as preventing placement outside the 
home, and we become the thing to be prevented." For the first time in 
anyone's memory The Children's Village, one of the largest and considered 
one of the best residential treatment centers in the country, has no 
waiting list. Dale says that children who might once have been sent there 
are being diverted to less restrictive, less expensive, and less 
appropriate options, such as foster-home care, on the presumption that a 
family setting is always better.<P>
"What's in vogue right now is family preservation," says Father Val, of 
Boys Town. "Just follow the trend. Watch the little lemmings dashing 
toward the sea. They will tire of family preservation the way they tired 
of de-institutionalization. It's as if they just discovered that it's a 
good idea to try to keep kids in families. It's an exegesis of the 
obvious." Father Val thinks that the need to frame the debate as either 
anti-family or anti-institution is inevitable, given the longing that human 
beings feel for simple answers to complex questions. Certainly the people 
who make child-welfare policy, as well as those who carry it out, believe 
that the either-or approach is self-defeating. Nevertheless, it persists. Earl Stuck, who was one of the 
supporters of the Family Preservation Act, acknowledges the problem. "When 
you try to sell something politically, you have to oversell your case."<P>
David Fanshel was until his recent retirement a professor at the Columbia 
University School of Social Work. A leader in the field of social work, 
and foster care in particular, Fanshel was the principal investigator in 
two major longitudinal studies on foster children in homes and 
institutions. At a time when many experts are questioning the value of 
residential treatment and promoting family preservation, Fanshel is going 
against the tide. He foresees a greater need for residential care in the 
near future. In fact, Fanshel, for decades one of the leading proponents 
of permanency planning, has modified his views. He now believes that 
permanent placement with a family is not an appropriate goal for about a 
quarter of the older, more seriously damaged and criminally inclined 
children in the system. He would like to see foster care reorganized into 
a two-tiered system in which permanent placement would remain the goal for 
the larger group, and the forestalling of criminal behavior through 
treatment would be the goal for the other group, which he calls "Subsystem 
B." He sees institutions playing a significant role in treating such 
dangerous children. The creation of two subsystems, Fanshel argues, "might 
help to avoid the inappropriate underfunding of Subsystem B now taking 
place in the interest of permanency planning."<P>
The debate between family preservationists and those who advocate the 
wider use of institutions has been going on for decades. Until as late as 
the 1920s pro-family reformers used the "orphan trains" to place children 
with farm families. Today their anti-institutional counterparts, in their 
determination to provide a home for every child, sometimes resort to 
"adoption fairs," where difficult-to-adopt children are viewed by 
prospective parents. The social worker who organized one such event told a 
reporter from Vogue that although these fairs can result in the adoption 
of as many as half the children, "it felt like a slave auction."<P>
Richard Small tells prospective adoptive parents, "If you're going to 
adopt a child from The Walker School, you're going out of your way to ask 
for trouble." Small is uncertain about whether it will be possible to find 
parents for six of the eight children at the school who were recently 
freed for adoption. One is a very disturbed twelve-year-old boy who has 
already suffered two failed adoptions. Small is faced with the opposite of 
King Solomon's conundrum: this time no mothers want the child. How hard 
should he try to find another adoptive family?<P>
"Another adoption with this boy would be likely to fail," says Small, who 
also knows that another rejection might harm the boy more than a lifetime 
without parents. On the other hand, can he consign the child to such 
permanent and profound loneliness? "He has no one," Small says, 
"absolutely no one."<P>
Small talked at length with the boy about the pros and cons of risking 
another adoption. Together, they had just about made up their minds in 
favor of life without parents when the boy wondered out loud, "Then who 
will take me for my driver's license?"<P>
"I wish," Small says, "that there were a place, a group home, where kids 
could live at those times when they couldn't live at home. We've got a 
number of youngsters in this society--who knows how many?--who are capable 
of being connected to people, who wish to be connected, who should be 
connected, but who can't live full-time with the people they're connected to. When they do, terrible things 
happen to both sides, the kids and the caretakers. These kids get placed 
in families repeatedly and they repeatedly fail. What are we going to do 
with these children? Right now we either put them in an institution or we 
put them in a family."<P><br>
<b>Going Home</b><P>
A good children's institution is a hard place to leave. In the 
institutional world the child has the advantage; in the real world the 
child does not. The experts consult. Parents and children consult. Is the 
family ready? Is the child ready?<P>
Twenty-five years ago 80 percent of the children who "graduated" from The 
Children's Village went home to some family member, most likely the 
mother. But starting about five years ago the percentage began to drop. 
Today only 55 percent go home to family. Nan Dale, citing her own 
subjective standard of measurement, the "GFF" (gut-feeling factor), 
estimates that half of that narrow majority are returning to a home 
situation that is fragile. At Woodland Hills, where most of the kids are 
released to the care of their families, David Kern says he feels uneasy 
about the prospects for success almost half the time. He calls sending 
vulnerable children home the worst part of the job. While he was at The 
Villages, Don Harris felt uneasy about returning kids to their parents 
about 80 percent of the time. "The reality is we can help these kids build 
some bridges to their families, but they probably will never be able to 
live with them."<P>
Not sending vulnerable children home can also be the worst part of the 
job. People who work with institutionalized children continually face a 
quandary to which they have no satisfactory solution: What should they do 
when, in spite of everyone's best efforts, family seems not to be in the 
best interests of the child? What the system has to offer is life in a 
group home followed by independent apartment living, and then nothing.<P>
Life without parents is a difficult sentence to pronounce upon a child, 
but it's happening more and more often. "Sometimes children have gone 
beyond the opportunity to go back and capture what needed to be done 
between the ages of three and eight," says Gene Baker, the chief 
psychologist at The Children's Village. "Sometimes the thrust of intimacy 
that comes with family living is more than they can handle. Sometimes the 
requirement of bonding is more than they have the emotional equipment to 
give. As long as we keep pushing them back into what is our idealized 
fantasy of family, they'll keep blowing it out of the water for 
us."

	<font size=5>W</font>hen I returned to Beijing in the fall of 1988, after an absence of six 
months, it was hard not to feel disoriented by the sudden change in 
political climate. During the previous spring and summer, political and 
intellectual life had begun to thaw to an extent unprecedented since the 
Chinese Communist Party had come to power, in 1949. Following on the heels 
of a bold program of economic reform and of opening up to the outside 
world, which China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, had launched in 
1978, this relaxation of Party control over economic, intellectual, and 
political life had filled the Chinese with a heady new sense of 
possibility. The increasing tolerance of individualism and freedom of 
expression reflected the surprising but growing conviction among China's 
new generation of reform-minded leaders that their country would never be 
successful in its efforts to modernize unless some dramatic way could be 
found to re-energize its people and win their willing participation in a 
new drive toward economic development. Political reform and 
democratization became their new rallying cries. But to the older, 
hard-line Maoists, who had spent their lives fighting for a very different 
kind of revolution--one that stressed centralization and Party discipline, 
rather than individual initiative and democracy--this latest wave of 
reform appeared as at best an unwelcome disruption and at worst a 
dangerous form of apostasy. While young reformers watched enthusiastically 
as official publications began to bloom with articles advocating freedom 
of speech and the press, the separation of governmental powers, and the 
protection of human rights, and as intellectuals publicly called for the 
democratization of almost all aspects of Chinese life, revolutionary 
hard-liners looked on with displeasure, waiting for an auspicious moment 
to counterattack.<p>

A deep wariness of speaking too freely had been burned into many senior 
intellectuals by the crackdowns that had, with a horrifying inevitability, 
terminated all previous interludes of liberalism in Chinese Communist 
history. While it was true that fall that the boundaries of acceptable 
political discourse were broader than ever, most intellectuals nonetheless 
prudently continued to try to stay within the elusive margins of Party 
tolerance. But there were a few who, seemingly without regard for their 
future, dared speak out openly. The most vocal of these was a 
fifty-two-year-old astrophysicist of international stature named Fang 
Lizhi, who by last year had become legendary throughout China for his 
forceful calls for democracy and his forthrightness in publicly saying 
what he believed.<p>

When I first met Fang, in his Beijing apartment last fall, what impressed 
me about him was his good cheer and guilelessness. He laughed easily--an 
infectious laugh that spiraled spontaneously into something like a whinny 
carrying everything with it in a burst of unpremeditated mirthfulness. He 
was dressed simply, in a knit shirt, a tweed coat, and permanent-press 
slacks. Tortoise-shell glasses gave him a slightly owlish look. He made an 
initial impression of ordinariness--until, that is, he began to talk. Then 
I instantly sensed that I was in the presence of a man of not only keen 
intelligence and conviction but fearlessness. The longer I was with him, 
the more the quality struck me. Far from being a studied posture adopted 
as a means of resisting intimidation, Fang's fearlessness appeared deeply 
rooted in his personality, which in spite of its manifest self-confidence 
betrayed no suggestion of arrogance. Seldom have I met a man who, although 
at the center of an intense and dangerous national controversy--the 
Communist Party had laid the blame for the student demonstrations of the 
previous winter on his frequent speeches to student groups, in which he 
openly advocated Western democracy--so lacked the kind of polemical energy 
that often makes zealots of a lesser kind shrill and self justifying. 
Although Fang obviously cared deeply about the cause of democracy in 
China, he was not one to thrust it upon anyone; and although he had been 
politically persecuted throughout his life, there was no hint of rancor or 
resentment in his politics. What he was for was so much ascendant over 
what he was against that the notion of enemies seemed utterly alien to his 
intellectual, political, and emotional vocabulary.<p>

What made being with him strangely uncharacteristic of my experiences in 
China was his complete lack of the self-censorship that renders many other 
Chinese intellectuals of his generation incapable of speaking their minds. 
Never overriding his thoughts and feelings with the usual subtle (and 
frequently unconscious) genuflections to the official political line of 
the moment, Fang spoke so openly about what he was thinking and what he 
believed that one had to suppress the urge to warn him of the dangers of 
such candor.<p>

Such warnings have in fact come from many quarters, but Fang is impervious 
to them. "Everything I have ever said is open," Fang told me. "I have 
nothing to hide. And since I have already said everything that I believe 
many times in public, what is the point of trying to hide things now, in 
private?"<p>




To recount those many times is to tell the story of his life, which began 
in Beijing in 1936, when he was born into the family of a postal clerk 
from the city of Hangzhou. He entered Beijing University (Beida) in 1952, 
as a student of theoretical and nuclear physics, and although he quickly 
distinguished himself as an unusually capable scientist, politics was as 
important to him as his studies. His first recorded brush with political 
dissent occurred one February day in 1955, during the founding meeting of 
the university chapter of the Communist Youth League (an organization that 
arranges political and recreational activities for young people and that 
anyone who intends to become a Party member must join). The league branch 
secretary from the physics department had been addressing the gathering, 
in the auditorium of Beida's administration building, and had just begun 
discussing the role of the league in stimulating idealism among China's 
youth when Fang Lizhi, then a nineteen-year-old student, dashed up onto 
the stage, indicating his desire to speak.<p>

"Some of us students in the physics department thought the meeting was too 
dull, just a lot of formalistic speeches," Fang has said. "So we decided 
to liven things up a bit. When it came time for our branch secretary to 
speak, he let me express my opinion, since I had the loudest voice." 
Taking over the stage from the secretary, Fang redirected the discussion 
to the general subject of the Chinese educational system. "I said that 
this kind of meeting was completely meaningless. I asked what kind of 
people we were turning out when what we should have been doing was 
training people to think independently. Just having the Three Goods [good 
health, good study practices, and good work] is such a depressing concept 
and hardly enough to motivate anyone.<p>

"After I spoke, the meeting fell into complete disorder. The next day the 
Party committee secretary, who was the top person in charge of ideological 
work for students at Beijing University, spoke all day. He said that 
although independent thinking was, of course, all well and good, students 
should settle down and study."<p>

In spite of his attraction to politics, Fang did in fact settle down to 
study, earning straight As at Beida. There he met his future wife, Li 
Shuxian, who was a fellow student in the physics department, which she 
ultimately joined as a faculty member. In 1956, at the age of twenty, Fang 
graduated from Beida and was assigned to work at the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences' Institute of Modern Physics Research. But a year later the 
Anti-Rightist Campaign began, and Chinese intellectuals who had spoken up 
during the previous Hundred Flowers Movement were ruthlessly persecuted. 
Because he had written a lengthy memorial on the need to reform China's 
educational system so that politics would not stifle scientific research, 
Fang was severely criticized. Unlike many other intellectuals under 
pressure, he refused to recant his alleged misdeeds and was expelled from 
the Party in 1957.<p>

"For a long time after the Anti-Rightist Campaign, I continued to believe 
in communism," Fang told me. "Even after I was expelled from the Party, I 
continued to have faith in Chairman Mao and believed that it must have 
been I who was wrong."<p>

Wrong or not, as a promising young scientist he was greatly needed by 
China in its early efforts to industrialize and was allowed to keep his 
position at the Institute of Modern Physics Research. He was ultimately 
even sent to help organize a new department of physics at the University 
of Science and Technology (Kexue Jishu Daxue, or Keda for short), which 
was just then being set up in Beijing. During the next few years, while 
teaching classes in quantum mechanics and electromagnetics, Fang also 
conducted research on solid-state and laser physics. Despite his previous 
political troubles, and because of his obvious talent in his field, in 
1963 he was promoted to the position of lecturer.<p>

But no sooner had Fang's life and career begun to resume a more normal 
course than the Cultural Revolution broke out, in 1966, and like so many 
other Chinese intellectuals. Fang once more ran afoul of politics. This 
time he was "struggled against" as a "reactionary" and incarcerated in a 
niupeng, or "cow shed"--a form of solitary confinement often chosen by the 
Red Guards for intellectuals of the "stinking ninth category" (Maoists had 
divided Chinese society into nine categories). After a year's imprisonment 
he was released and "sent down" to the countryside in Anhui province to 
work with the peasantry. Here, because of the paucity of scientific books 
available to him, he was forced to change the focus of his scholarly work 
and to concentrate on the study of relativity and theoretical astrophysics.<p>

"I had only one book with me--the Soviet physicist Lev Landau's Classical 
Theory of Fields," Fang told me. "For six months I did nothing but read 
this book over and over again. It was this curious happenstance alone that 
caused me to switch fields from solid-state physics to cosmology.<p>

"It was then that I began to feel that perhaps Mao was not so good for the 
country. But because at the time most of us intellectuals still believed 
in communism, we were left with a difficult question: If not Mao, whom 
should we follow? There was, of course, no one else, and he was the 
embodiment of all idealism.<p>

"After the Cultural Revolution started, everything became much clearer. I 
realized that the Party had not been telling the truth, that they had in 
fact been deceiving people, and that I should not believe them anymore. 
You see, a sense of duty, responsibility, and loyalty to the country had 
been inculcated within me as a youth, but what I saw around me made me 
feel that the leaders weren't similarly concerned about the country and 
weren't shouldering responsibility for its people."<p>

In 1969, when the Academy of Sciences began to move several of the 
undergraduate departments of Keda from Beijing to the provincial capital 
of Hefei, in Anhui, Fang, along with several dozen other academics who had 
been stigmatized with rightist labels, was exiled with them. In Hefei, 
Fang began to study and teach astrophysics, but because of the political 
cloud hanging over him, he was able to publish the results of his research 
only under a pseudonym.<p>

His full rehabilitation did not come about until 1978, two years after the 
fall of the Gang of Four. At this time he regained his Party membership 
and received tenure at Keda, shortly thereafter becoming China's youngest 
full professor. The next few years were perhaps his most creative, from a 
scientific point of view. Fang, who was increasingly interested in the 
cosmology of the early universe, began to publish frequently on this 
subject, now under his own name. (By 1986 he had more than 130 articles to 
his credit.) In 1980 his popularity at Keda led to his being elected 
director of the fundamental-physics department, with more than 90 percent 
of the faculty's 120 votes. However, his politically progressive views and 
outspokenness continued to cause the Party to distrust him. Because of 
secret reports from a fellow professor impugning his political 
reliability, Fang, though nominated several times for the post of 
vice-president of the University of Science and Technology, was rejected.<p>

What was ultimately to have the profoundest impact on Fang was his 
readings in politics and his travels abroad, which became possible as a 
result of Deng Xiaoping's open-door policy. In 1978 Fang left China for 
the first time, to attend a conference on relativistic astrophysics in 
Munich. Subsequent trips took him to the Vatican, for a cosmology 
conference; to Bogota, Colombia, for another conference; to Italy, as a 
visiting professor at the University of Rome; to England, as a senior 
visiting fellow at the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University; to 
Japan, as a visiting professor at Kyoto University's Research Institute 
for Fundamental Physics; and finally to the United States, where he was in 
residence at the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, from March 
through July of 1986. These trips abroad were to influence deeply the way 
that Fang looked at the Chinese socialist system and the role of 
intellectuals within it.<p>

In spite of many years of political harassment and periodic near-total 
isolation from the world scientific community, Fang had now become one of 
the very few scientists from the People's Republic ever to have received 
such international scientific attention and acclaim. Fang was even more 
unusual for his interest in education, philosophy, and politics, as well 
as science--interests that grew out of his conviction that in any truly 
creative mind science and philosophy, of which he took politics to be an 
extension, were indissolubly bound together.<p>

Just as scientific research was a way of bearing witness to truths about 
the natural world, so, Fang believed, intellectual and political inquiry 
were ways of bearing witness to truths about the political and social 
world.<p>

Interviewed by the writer Dai Qing in the newspaper Guangming Daily in 
December of 1986, Fang explained his notion of the special role that he 
hoped scientists, as intellectuals, would play in the development of a 
modern China. He noted, prophetically in his own case, that "almost 
invariably, it has been the natural scientists who have been the first to 
become conscious of the emergence of each social crisis." Then, evidently 
paraphrasing Einstein, he declared, "Scientists must express their 
feelings about all aspects of society, especially when unreasonable, 
wrong, or evil things emerge. If they do otherwise, they will be 
considered accomplices."<p>

Fang's remedy for the claustrophobic intellectual climate of most Chinese 
educational institutions was to scrutinize their shortcomings both 
honestly and relentlessly. "The emergence and development of new theories 
necessitates creating an atmosphere of democracy and freedom in the 
university," he told Dai Qing. "In the university there should be nothing 
that...allows no questioning of why it must be upheld. There should be no 
doctrine allowed to hold a leading or guiding position in an a priori way."<p>

As he tried to play his part as a "conscience of civilization," one of the 
most shocking things that Fang began to say publicly was that socialism as 
an ideology was passe for China. "When I first said this, back in 1980, 
Fang Yi, the Vice-Premier in charge of science and technology, called me 
in and criticized me," Fang Lizhi told me with an impish smile one day. 
"He said, 'How could you say a thing like that?' And I replied, 'I said it 
because I believe it.' He said, 'Well, I might go even so far as to say 
that I agree with you, but one can't just come right out and say such a 
thing!'"<p><br>


<b>FANG EMERGES AS LEADER</b><p>

In 1984 Fang Lizhi was finally promoted to the position of vice-president 
of the University of Science and Technology, and Guan Weiyan, a colleague 
in physics, was appointed president. Clearly, Fang's star was now rising. 
There were soon efforts among the liberal reform faction in China's 
central leadership to nominate Fang for high provincial office, and even 
to confer upon him membership in the Party's central Committee--all this 
despite his refusal to maintain Party discipline and promote its mythology.<p>

The next year the Ministry of Education issued a report, "The Reform of 
China's Educational Structure," calling for dramatic changes in the 
country's university system. It recommended that administrators be elected 
to top positions by committees of academics, rather than being appointed 
by the Party. Fang and Guan designed and proposed a radical plan to 
redistribute power horizontally at Keda. Instead of keeping all authority 
concentrated in the hands of top-level administrators, allowing them to 
control research funding, the awarding of degrees, and faculty promotions, 
these functions would be spread out among special committees and the 
departments themselves.<p>

A second reform proposed in the plan involved establishing the right of 
faculty and staff members to audit all administrative meetings. Fang held 
that since the socialist system claimed to have made the people the 
masters of their own country, the people should have the right to know 
what their leaders were up to. This was an especially important concept 
for Fang, because he believed that a major defect of Chinese society was 
that in the absence of oversight provisions, problems and grievances piled 
up unsolved until any given situation became explosive.<p>

A third area of reform that concerned Fang and Guan was free speech. They 
wished to establish firmly the right of students and faculty members not 
only to speak out on campus but also to remain free from subtler but not 
necessarily less crippling forms of ideological repression. Fang and Guan 
wished to create an open academic and political environment at Keda, and 
since in their view diversity was something to be cultivated, not 
suppressed, it was their conviction that anyone should be able to put up a 
handbill and hold an event on campus without having to seek prior approval 
from some higher authority.<p>

This was indeed a bold vision of academic freedom, such as the People's 
Republic of China had never known. But Fang and Guan did not stop there. 
To foster openness with a cosmopolitan dimension, they also sought to 
establish as much contact as possible with the outside world. By the end 
of 1986 more than 900 faculty members and students from Keda had been sent 
abroad to visit, lecture, and study, and more than 200 foreign scholars 
had visited Keda. Exchange programs had been set up with educational 
institutions in the United States, Japan, Britain, Italy, and France.<p>

Fang's experience with this reform process convinced him that the most 
meaningful task he could undertake in China was not scientific research 
but pressing for change in the country's educational system. "I am 
determined to create intellectual and academic freedom--this will be my 
top priority," he said, with his usual directness, when asked about his 
future plans. In the context of a Western democracy, where traditions like 
intellectual and academic freedom are taken for granted, such a 
declaration might sound commonplace, but coming from a university 
vice-president in China just as it emerged from the Cultural Revolution, 
his words had the effect of throwing down a gauntlet to Party hard-liners.<p>

Moreover, while Fang was helping to fashion these educational reforms at 
Keda, he was by no means shutting himself off from the broader political 
issues and currents of the country at large. In fact, in 1985 and 1986 
Fang seemed to turn up whenever and wherever there was open political 
discussion or ferment, a habit that must have caused consternation among 
those hard-liners in the Party hierarchy whose conception of the "mass 
line" had never included radical educational reform, much less a 
spontaneous political campaign for the democratization of Chinese life, 
led by roaming freethinkers like Fang.<p>

On November 4, 1985, in a stirring, free-ranging, and sometimes even 
humorous talk that held his Beida audience spellbound, Fang encouraged the 
students to hold on to their social concern and political activism and to 
look to the West for new models of intellectual commitment if none could 
be found in China. Addressing himself to the larger issues of China's 
backwardness and his hopes for its future, Fang declared,<p><blockquote>

"...There is a social malaise in our country today, and the primary reason 
for it is the poor example set by Party members. Unethical behavior by 
Party leaders is especially to blame. This is a situation that clearly 
calls for action on the part of intellectuals...."<p>

"...We are obligated to work for the improvement of society....This 
requires that we break the bonds of social restraint when necessary. 
Creativity has not been encouraged over the past three decades as being in 
keeping with Chinese tradition. It is a shame that, as a result, China has 
yet to produce work worthy of consideration for a Nobel Prize. Why is 
this?..."<p>

"One reason for this situation is our social environment. Many of us who 
have been to foreign countries to study or work agree that we can perform 
much more efficiently and productively abroad than in China....Foreigners 
are no more intelligent than we Chinese. Why, then, can't we produce 
first-rate work? The reasons for our inability to develop our potential 
lie within our social system....[This translation and several that follow 
are those of the China Spring Digest.]"</blockquote><p>

Placing the blame for China's backwardness on the closed nature of its 
society, Fang continued,<p><blockquote>

"...Some of us dare not speak out. But if we all spoke out, there would be 
nothing to be afraid of. This is surely one important cause of our lack of 
idealism and discipline.<p>

"Another cause is that over the years our propaganda about communism has 
been seriously flawed....Room must be made for the great variety of 
excellence that has found expression in human civilization. Our narrow 
propaganda seems to imply that....nothing that came before us has any 
merit whatsoever. This is the most worthless and destructive form of 
propaganda. Propaganda can be used to praise Communist heroes, but it 
should not be used to tear down other heroes....<p>

"We Communist Party members should be open to different ways of thinking. 
We should be open to different cultures and willing to adopt the elements 
of those cultures that are clearly superior. A great diversity of thought 
should be allowed in colleges and universities. For if all thought is 
narrow and simplistic, creativity will die. At present there are certainly 
some people in power who still insist on dictating to others according to 
their own narrow principles....<p>

"We must not be afraid to speak openly about these things. In fact, it is 
our duty. If we remain silent, we will fail to live up to our 
responsibility."<p></blockquote>




The Beida students had never heard a respected faculty member speak 
publicly like this before, and Fang's effect was electrifying. Moreover, 
it was only one of many talks that Fang would give over the next year, as 
he traveled to other cities, quickly earning himself the reputation of 
being China's foremost freethinker. Fang Lizhi is a singular figure in 
post-Mao China. The content of his speeches made it difficult to remember 
that he was still a member of the Chinese Communist Party, where, as ever, 
the watchwords were discipline and obedience.<p>

Meanwhile, so successful were Fang and Guan's reforms at Keda that the 
official Party newspaper, the People's Daily, caught up in China's new 
dalliance with democratic thinking, ran a series of five articles, in 
October and November of 1986, describing them in the most adulatory way, a 
move tantamount to giving them the Party's seal of approval. In fact, the 
writer, Lu Fang, was so impressed by what he had seen at Keda that from 
the very first sentence of the first article he seemed unable to control 
his enthusiasm. Instead of reciting a litany of facts and statistics to 
introduce his subject, as this genre of news feature often calls for, he 
dove right in and began, "During my trip to Keda, everywhere I breathed 
the air of democracy." Lu went on to praise the openness and 
"unconstrained atmosphere" of the university in which students and faculty 
members worked together.<p>

Still mindful during those halcyon days of democratic dialogue that even 
the warmest political climate in China can suddenly frost over, the 
People's Daily published another article that fall asking rhetorically if 
it were not a concern that the radical experiments in educational reform 
at Keda might someday be branded as "wholesale Westernization," a 
derogatory term used by Party hard-liners to describe any overtly Western 
phenomenon. "Perhaps someone will bring up the question," the article went 
on to answer itself. "In applying a system of 'separate and balanced 
powers' to run a college, is there not always some danger of being 
suspected of imitating Western capitalism? But the methods used at Keda 
are actually in accordance with the directions of Party Central regarding 
the 'practical application of democratization to every aspect of social 
life.' They are in accordance with the Constitution which prescribes 
academic freedom. It [democracy] is not something that is being 'sneaked 
in the back door' here. We should have no suspicion about that."<p>

The effect of these articles in the People's Daily was both to transform 
Keda into an official new post-Mao model university and to elevate Guan 
and Fang to the status of semi-official national heroes. The glare of the 
spotlight, far from cowing Fang into silence as it might some 
intellectuals, seemed hardly to faze him. In November, Shanghai's World 
Economic Herald ran an article that quoted Fang as declaring that China's 
intellectuals "lack their own independent mentality and a standard of 
value, always yield to power, and link their futures to an official 
career...And once they become officials themselves, many intellectuals 
change their attitude from being absolutely obedient to higher levels to 
being absolutely conceited. They suppress and attack other intellectuals."<p>

Fang went on to call on intellectuals to remake themselves and, instead of 
being slavishly obedient to those above them, to "straighten out their 
bent backs." And then, as if he had despaired of the older generation, he 
ended with an appeal to Chinese to "place their hopes in those younger 
intellectuals who are growing up during the nineteen eighties."<p>

It was one thing to crusade for educational reforms, even to discuss 
democracy, human rights, or checks and balances in the abstract, but here 
was Fang Lizhi implicitly appealing to youthful intellectuals (and also 
his academic peers) to form a powerful new check against Party power. This 
was a bold challenge indeed, for Fang seemed to be implying that the 
Party's failure to reform itself from within now justified pressure from 
without.<p><br>


<b>STUDENTS TAKE FANG'S MANDATE AS THEIR OWN</b><p>

It was obvious to anyone watching that students were powerfully drawn to 
Fang, not only by his intelligence, candor, and irreverence but also by 
his willingness to name names. Never had a leader spoken to them so 
unguardedly about Party pomposity, favoritism, prejudice, even corruption. 
The Party might have tolerated his tweaking its tail over such apparent 
hypocrisies as a Constitution that guaranteed rights it was not prepared 
to defend, but it could hardly countenance his outright attack on 
high-ranking officials.<p>

In 1985, for instance, Fang publicly denounced the vice-mayor of Beijing, 
Zhang Baifa, for contriving to join a scientific delegation that had been 
invited to attend a conference on synchrotron radiation in New York state. 
Fang had learned of the case because China's lone synchrotron was jointly 
operated by his own university and the Institute of High Energy Physics, 
in Beijing. Fang's refusal to overlook this kind of junketing and 
feather-bedding by the Party elite, and his willingness to bring such 
cases to the attention of student activists, made him an even greater 
favorite of young intellectuals disgusted with such behavior.<p>

When criticized by ranking Party leaders for his lese majeste, Fang 
replied, "As for Zhang Baifa appropriating the conference seats that 
should have gone to the University, I just want to ask him what he knows 
about synchrotrons. Is he willing to take a test?" As a result of his 
attack on the vice-mayor, Fang's trip to the Institute of Advanced Study, 
planned for January, 1986, was suddenly canceled. It was not until two 
months later that Fang, still refusing to recant, was finally allowed to 
leave the country.<p>

Upon returning to China from the United States late that fall, just as 
appeals for political reform reached a crescendo, Fang traveled to several 
Chinese cities, making speeches, holding discussion groups, and giving 
interviews. His calls for democracy were bolder and more uncompromising 
than ever, and his fearlessness more pronounced. During November, 
particularly in student circles, Fang Lizhi's name was spoken more and 
more often. In Beijing, Hefei, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Shanghai--wherever he 
spoke--young people listened, recorded, and even transcribed his talks by 
hand, and sent them on to friends and student groups all across China, and 
even to colleagues studying in the United States and Europe. Chinese 
students, who had almost completely lost the kind of socialist idealism 
that had so distinguished their parents' generation during earlier phases 
of the Chinese Communist Revolution, now seemed perched on the precipice 
of a whole new system of beliefs. In the ideological vacuum of the 1980s 
they thirsted for someone and something to believe in. Just as these young 
Chinese had come to worship the West for its appliances, style, culture, 
and technology, now they were becoming entranced with its political ideas 
and "isms." Nowhere was the threadbare nature of Marxism-Leninism and Mao 
Zedong thought more evident than in the way many of these young Chinese 
intellectuals found themselves drawn to the gospel of democracy as 
preached by Fang Lizhi.<p>

When the Party repeatedly urged Fang to tone down his message, he refused, 
and even fired a salvo or two at Deng's sacred Four Cardinal Principles, 
which upheld socialism, the people's democratic dictatorship, the 
leadership of the Communist Party, and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong 
thought. When asked what he thought of them, he replied that although he 
realized they were "articles of faith among the political leadership," he 
preferred four different principles--namely, "science, democracy, 
creativity, and independence." He went on to observe that if his 
principles conflicted with those of the Party, it was only because the 
latter "advocated superstition instead of science, dictatorship instead of 
democracy, conservatism instead of creativity, and dependency rather than 
independence."<p>

In November, Fang Lizhi gave several speeches in Shanghai. Appearing on 
the campus of Tongji University on November 18, he addressed a crowd of 
students on the subject of democracy, reform, and modernization, rousing 
them to repeated rounds of applause. "We now have a strong sense of 
urgency about achieving modernization in China," he told the 
students.<p><blockquote>

"...Chinese intellectual life, material civilization, moral fiber, and 
government are in dire straits....The truth is that every aspect of the 
Chinese world needs to be modernized....As for myself, I think that 
all-around openness is the only way to modernize. [It is interesting to 
note that Fang claims to have consistently used the term quanfangwei 
kaifang ("all-around openness") rather than quanpan xifanghua ("wholesale 
Westernization").] I believe in such a thorough and comprehensive 
liberalization because Chinese culture is not just backward in a 
particular respect but primitive in an overall sense....We are still far 
behind the rest of the world. And, frankly, I feel we lag behind because 
the decades of socialist experimentation since Liberation have been--well, 
a failure! [Long applause.] This is not just my opinion, it is clear for 
all to see. Socialism is at a low ebb. There is no getting around the fact 
that no socialist state in the post-Second World War era has been 
successful, nor has our own thirty-odd-year-long socialist experiment...I 
am here to tell you that the socialist movement from Marx and Lenin to 
Stalin and Mao Zedong has been a failure....Clearing our minds of all 
Marxist dogma is the first step...."</blockquote><p>

After this uncompromising attack on China's socialist patron saints, Fang 
went on to proclaim:<p><blockquote>

"...We must remold our society by absorbing influences from all cultures. 
What we must not do is isolate ourselves and allow our conceit to convince 
us that we alone are correct...."<p></blockquote>

For Fang, the most "critical component" of democracy was human 
rights.<p><blockquote>

"....Human rights are fundamental privileges that people have from birth, 
such as the right to think and be educated, the right to marry, and so on. 
But we Chinese consider these rights dangerous. Although human rights are 
universal and concrete, we Chinese lump freedom, equality and brotherhood 
together with capitalism and criticize them all in the same terms. If we 
are the democratic country we say we are, these rights should be stronger 
here than elsewhere, but at present they are nothing more than an abstract 
idea. [Enthusiastic applause.]<p>

"I feel that the first step toward democratization should be the 
recognition of human rights....But [in China] democratization has come to 
mean something performed by superiors on inferiors--a serious 
misunderstanding of democracy. [Loud applause.] Our government does not 
give us democracy simply by loosening our bonds a bit. This gives us only 
enough freedom to writhe a little. [Enthusiastic applause.] Freedom by 
decree is not fit to be called democracy, because...it fails to provide 
the most basic human rights....<p>

"In a democratic nation democracy flows from the individual, and the 
government has responsibilities toward him....We must make our government 
realize that it is economically dependent on its citizens, because such is 
the basis of democracy. But feudal traditions are still strong in China; 
social relations are initiated by superiors and accepted by inferiors....<p>

"People of other societies believe that criminal accusations arising from 
casual suspicion harm human dignity and privacy. In China, on the other 
hand, it is not only normal for me to inform on you...but considered a 
positive virtue. I would be praised for my alertness and contribution to 
class struggle in spite of my disrespect for democracy and human 
rights...."</blockquote><p>

Having reiterated his belief that democracy made the people rather than 
the government sovereign, he went on to redefine the position of a 
university in Chinese society.<p><blockquote>

"...To liberate oneself from the slavery of governmental and other 
nonintellectual authorities, one need only view knowledge as an 
independent organism. But this is not so in China. Our universities 
produce tools, not educated men. [Applause.] Our graduates cannot think 
for themselves. They are quite happy to be the docile instruments of 
someone else's purposes. China's intelligentsia has still not cleansed 
itself of this tendency....Knowledge should be independent of power. It 
must never submit, for knowledge loses its value as soon as it bows to 
power...."</blockquote><p>

About Party pressure against his outspokenness, Fang said,<p><blockquote>

"I have heard grumbling about my political ideas, and that is fine. But I 
simply will not accept any interference in my scientific 
research....Democracy will have no protection until the entire scientific 
community is filled with this spirit. The products of scientific knowledge 
should be appraised by scientific standards. We should not be swayed by 
the winds of power. Only then can we modernize, and only then will we have 
real democracy."</blockquote><p>

Fang's speeches, putting into words what many of his colleagues thought 
but dared not utter in public, were like detonations beneath the whole 
edifice of Party thought control. Here at last, after thirty-five years 
during which almost all alternative or oppositional thoughts had been 
suppressed, was a man who when he spoke made no effort to censor the 
forbidden or divide his thoughts between the private and the public. 
Because Fang and a small number of other dissidents, including Liu Binyan 
and Wang Ruowang, writers who in spite of almost constant Party 
persecution had continued to write exposes and critiques of Party 
malfeasance and stupidity, continued to speak and to suggest alternative 
ways of looking at the Party, China, and the world, political discourse in 
China had acquired a new depth of field, a three-dimensionality in which 
Party orthodoxy at least momentarily lost its monopoly.<p>

Early that winter, just as Fang and many other Chinese intellectuals began 
evincing some sense of hope that China might succeed after all in evolving 
politically toward greater democratization, a series of events that no one 
had anticipated took place. Beginning in Hefei, at Fang's own university 
on December 5, and ending in Beijing on January 1, twenty large Chinese 
cities were suddenly racked by demonstrations in which students demanded a 
speed-up in political reform. Tens of thousands of protesters flooded the 
streets of urban China carrying placards and banners emblazoned with such 
slogans as NO DEMOCRATIZATION, NO MODERNIZATION and GOVERNMENT OF THE 
PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE. Campuses were festooned with 
wall posters proclaiming anti-Party sentiments like I HAVE A DREAM, A 
DREAM OF FREEDOM. I HAVE A DREAM OF DEMOCRACY. I HAVE A DREAM OF LIFE 
ENDOWED WITH HUMAN RIGHTS. MAY THE DAY COME WHEN ALL THESE ARE MORE THAN 
DREAMS.<p>

Alarmed by the specter of political chaos, the Party reflexively acted to 
quell the disturbances and to locate and root out their causes. Urged on 
by Maoist hard-liners, for whom the student uprising had been the 
embodiment of their worst fears about reform, the Party launched a swift 
counterattack.<p><br>


<b>THE PARTY REACTS TO FANG AND THE PROTESTS</b><p>

In early January of last year, just after the student demonstrations had 
ended, the Anhui Daily (published in Hefei, the home of Keda) ran an 
article that, like advance artillery fire softening up an enemy target, 
seemed to be preparing its readers for a larger political campaign to 
follow. Taking a surprisingly soft line on the recent demonstrations, the 
article said that student "enthusiasm and concern about the fate of our 
nation and the future of reforms is understandable." The real blame for 
the recent upheavals, it suggested, lay elsewhere--namely, in the hands of 
that "very small number of people who had spurred on the trend of 
'bourgeois liberalization,' propagated opinions against the Four Cardinal 
Principles, and taken advantage of the students' enthusiasm and lack of 
experience in society to achieve their political aims."<p>

The Guangming Daily, which just the previous year had jubilantly 
proclaimed, "Our socialist system not only does not fear people speaking 
out but encourages them to do so," now lashed out menacingly against 
overly Westernized notions of democracy. On January 11 it ran a commentary 
with the headline "THE ESSENCE OF POLITICAL 'WHOLESALE WESTERNIZATION' 
MEANS DISCARDING SOCIALISM," which suggested that the students had been 
manipulated into demonstrating by a certain unnamed "Vice-President 
comrade of a university."<p>

On January 12 Zhou Guangzhao, a member of the Central Committee of the 
Chinese Communist Party and the vice-president of the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences, summoned the Keda faculty to a special meeting. In the very 
center of the front row of the large meeting hall were two conspicuously 
empty seats. When the room fell silent, Zhou Guangzhao announced that the 
Party Central Committee and the State Council had decided to remove Guan 
Weiyan, the president of the university, and Fang Lizhi, the 
vice-president, from office and to reassign them, respectively, to the 
Institute of Physics and the Beijing Observatory, both in the capital.<p>

After announcing this coup, Zhou Guangzhao accused Fang of having 
"disseminated many erroneous statements reflecting 'bourgeois 
liberalization'" and of having departed from the Four Cardinal Principles. 
He continued his attack by saying that Fang's "ideas of running the school 
by attempting to shake off the Party leadership and departing from the 
socialist road had resulted in extremely nasty consequences for Keda. 
These erroneous ideas were fully revealed in the recent disturbance 
created by students of this university."<p>

The assessment made by the secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party 
Committee, Li Guixian, was even more extreme. He claimed that Fang had 
"defamed the Party's cadres and leadership, and negated the cause of the 
Party over the past few decades, slandered and distorted the socialist 
system, and sown discord in the relations between the Party and 
intellectuals, especially among young intellectuals." Then, in that Maoist 
way so recognizable to all Chinese, Li began to speak directly to Fang's 
former colleagues in the audience, seeming to offer understanding while 
actually delivering a threat. "It should be noted that most cadres and 
teachers at Keda disapprove of, and many comrades resolutely reject, Fang 
Lizhi's erroneous words and deeds. Some comrades may have made some 
erroneous remarks under Fang Lizhi's influence, but it is a good thing 
that today they have realized their mistakes and corrected themselves. 
Those few comrades who up to now have failed to do so are allowed to take 
some time to realize their mistakes, but they must observe discipline."<p>

Over the next few days articles in the official press railed against Fang. 
These attacks were so relentless, repetitive, and overblown that it 
sometimes seemed as if the Party despaired of convincing even its own 
members, not to mention other intellectuals, of the righteousness of its 
actions, except by the sheer force and volume of its rhetoric. Any 
lingering uncertainties about whether the orders for Fang's ouster had 
come from the very top of the Party were dispelled when, a day after 
Fang's dismissal, Deng Xiaoping himself denounced Fang Lizhi, along with 
Liu Binyan and Wang Ruowang, by name during a meeting with Noboru 
Takeshita, then the Secretary General of the Japanese Liberal-Democratic 
Party and now Japan's Premier.<p>

Fang's ouster set off an immediate reaction at Keda. Students organized a 
petition drive to protest his dismissal and put up banners saying, IT IS 
CHINA'S SHAME THAT IT CANNOT EMBRACE SUCH A SCHOLAR AS FANG LIZHI, and MR. 
GUAN AND MR. FANG, YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE YOUR SACRIFICES. WE MISS YOU AND 
HOPE WE WILL SEE YOU AGAIN. Authorities quashed the petition drive and 
tore down the banners.<p>

On January 16, four days after Fang's dismissal, the Chinese were stunned 
to hear that Hu Yaobang, the Party general Secretary and the man widely 
considered to be Deng Xiaoping's chosen successor, had been removed from 
office. But the Party did not stop even here. A week later, on January 19 
(as if Fang's dismissal from his position at Keda had not sufficiently rid 
China's system of him), Xu Leyi, a deputy Party secretary in Anhui 
province, appeared on evening television and completed the new purge. For 
seven minutes of the half-hour news broadcast he was shown reading a 
statement from the Anhui Provincial Party Committee announcing that Fang 
Lizhi had not only lost his job but also been expelled from the Chinese 
Communist Party. In the communique that followed, the Party enumerated the 
now familiar litany of Fang's "extremely serious" mistakes, each one 
backed up by a list of offending quotations.<p>




The Fang Lizhi affair quickly became a cause celebre in China. Within days 
of his dismissal, members of the foreign press and the diplomatic 
community in Beijing were referring to him as China's Sakharov. Chinese 
intellectuals, even those who did not completely agree with Fang's 
uncompromising vision of democracy for their country, applauded him for 
his unwavering boldness. The Party, desperate to stem this hagiographic 
treatment of Fang, was relentless in its media campaign against him. Even 
the People's Daily, which only two months earlier had lionized Fang and 
Guan for having created a model university at Keda, now ridiculed them, 
claiming that in "waving the banner of running universities in a 
democratic way" they were "passing fish eyes off as pearls" and letting 
"vulcanized copper masquerade as gold." This was certainly not the first 
time that a Chinese publication had been forced to reverse itself--and 
surely there are few kinds of intellectual debasement worse than the 
forced repudiation by a writer or an editor of passionately held and 
publicly expressed beliefs--to keep its political position parallel to the 
careening Party line.<p>

Fang's outspoken espousal of democracy and human rights had put the Party 
in a difficult bind, and made it appear grossly inconsistent. Having 
vigorously tried to cultivate intellectuals at various times during the 
previous years with ever wider calls for ever greater freedom and 
democracy, it now seemed bent on persecuting them again in a way that 
could not but remind members of the Chinese intelligentsia of the 
Anti-Rightist Campaign, which had followed Mao's call for the Hundred 
Flowers Movement, in the mid-fifties. Sometimes it appeared as if the 
Party, unable to find the "golden mean" (zhongyong)--the middle way 
revered by classical Chinese political philosophers--hoped at least to 
create an optical illusion of moderation by oscillating back and forth 
rapidly between the extremes, alternately coddling and punishing its 
intellectuals. When, some months later, I asked Fang if he believed that 
democratization could ever take place in China under the prevailing 
conditions, he replied. "In China the concept of democratization has often 
been nothing more than a poker chip in what is really a game of power. 
Maybe there are still a few idealistic leaders, but on the whole most are 
preoccupied with the struggle for power, and they use such concepts as 
democracy as just another means of defeating their opponents. One side 
will say, 'I stand for reform and you don't, so you shouldn't be here!' 
The other will say, 'No! Reform is wrong, so you shouldn't be here!' In 
the end it is the Chinese people who suffer, because they get used as 
playthings."<p>

The Party's treatment of Fang pointed up the contradiction embedded within 
its whole modernization program and within its past as well. If China was 
to modernize, the Party urgently needed to rally to its cause those 
students and intellectuals who had been alienated from it for so many 
years. The key element of this mobilization process included both granting 
them more freedom and opening China's doors to the outside world. The 
predicament in which the Party found itself was that along with foreign 
capital, technology, science, languages, and management techniques came 
foreign political ideas and values that by their nature challenged the 
hegemony of one-party rule and led to the kind of hard-line neo-Maoist 
reaction to which Fang, like so many intellectuals before him in Chinese 
Communist history, had fallen prey. What was the Party to do? Allow such 
subversive heresies as democracy, freedom, and human rights to spread 
unchecked, or crush the students and intellectuals and risk losing their 
creative energies for the paramount task of developing China?<p>

Neither alternative seemed acceptable. Desperately needing to find some 
compromise position, the Party did the only thing it could: it acted 
inconsistently. By slapping down Fang Lizhi it sent out a signal that 
while intellectuals were being granted unprecedented new freedoms, public 
political discourse was not to be among them. However, by limiting its 
punitive actions to what by historical Party standards were mild ones, it 
sought at the same time to reassure intellectuals that China was not 
returning to the political dark ages. In effect, the message was this: "As 
long as you are willing to leave the supremacy of the Communist Party 
unchallenged, we will grant you considerable freedom. If you challenge the 
Party and socialism as its official canon, you will be punished--but not 
as harshly as before." The reformers in the Party were trying to keep a 
delicate balance between the imperatives of modernization and those of 
control. But that January when it was rocked by renewed factional struggle 
after the tumultuous student demonstrations of the previous month, it was 
teetering ominously.<p><br>


<b>UNINTENDED PROPAGANDA</b><p>

About a month after Fang Lizhi was dismissed from his job, expelled from 
the Party and ordered back to the capital to take up the post of 
researcher at the Beijing Observatory (his wife still taught at Beijing 
University), I happened to stop by the house of a friend of mine, a 
longtime Party member who is an up-and-coming official in a state-run 
enterprise. He, his sister (also a Party member) and I had been eating 
dried persimmons and watermelon seeds, chatting, and half-heartedly 
watching a television program about new strains of purebred swine that 
were being introduced into Chinese herds, when my friend suddenly 
disappeared into his bedroom. Moments later he reappeared and, with a 
conspiratorial smile, handed me a thick sheaf of photocopied papers. To my 
surprise it consisted of ninety-one pages of speeches and interviews with 
Fang Lizhi, printed in bold, oversize characters that even the 
sight-impaired could have read in a dim light, and arranged in 
chronological order from March, 1985, through December, 1986, complete 
with a table of contents.<p>

Since the Party was at present ill disposed toward both Fang and all 
illegal publishing ventures, I expressed amazement at seeing Fang's very 
controversial speeches printed up in what looked like published form. I 
asked if my friend had found the collection at some outdoor bookstall, 
thinking it might have been put out surreptitiously by an underground 
network of dissidents, as were journals that had circulated in 1978 and 
1979, during the Democracy Wall period.<p>

"Not at all--I got these from the Party itself," my friend replied, 
clearly enjoying my surprise. "The collection is a neibu ['internal,' a 
designation for documents not to be shown outside restricted Party 
circles] that all of us in the Party are being required to study and 
criticize."<p>

Smirking, his sister slapped the sheaf of paper and told me that the Party 
had sent every Party branch copies of Fang's selected works so that all 
members might hold study meetings to "criticize his erroneous bourgeois 
liberal line."<p>

"And did you hold such meetings?" I asked.<p>

"You know," my friend's sister replied, her smirk breaking into a full 
smile, "before the Party handed down this document, no one in our unit 
really knew much about Fang Lizhi except that he had been vice-president 
at Keda and that he had run into some trouble with the Party over the 
student demonstrations. Few people had paid much attention to him, and we 
didn't have much of an idea what he really stood for. However, after the 
Party compiled these speeches, disseminated them to every Party branch, 
and then actually required members to read them, we of course got a better 
sense of him, and an awful lot of people suddenly started saying, 'Hmmm. 
This guy Fang isn't bad! In fact, he makes a lot of sense!' Before I knew 
what was happening, many people in my unit became not only quite 
interested in what Fang had to say but quite sympathetic toward him as 
well."<p>

"How did the discussion sessions actually work out?"<p>

They both laughed. "Unfortunately, it was my responsibility to organize 
the study meeting to criticize Fang at my unit," my friend said, rolling 
his eyes upward. "What could I do? As a result of reading the document, so 
many people had ended up agreeing with Fang, the very person they were 
supposed to get together to criticize, that it became next to impossible 
for us to hold a meeting."<p>

"So what did you do?"<p>

"It was ridiculous! I finally just said, 'Forget it!,' wrote a report, and 
sent it on up to my superiors, saying that we had all read the required 
documents and had learned much from one another's criticisms."<p>

"Did any units you know of actually hold criticism meetings?"<p>

"Probably. But I imagine this kind of charade went on elsewhere in the 
Party too."<p>

"What's the attitude of your co-workers now toward these kinds of study 
meetings?" I asked.<p>

"Well, of course, we don't have them as often as we used to," my friend 
replied with a suggestion of embarrassment. "But when documents do come 
down from Central, we have to get together to act out the ritual. Usually 
there's a lot of joking around, because our attitude is that if the 
leaders want to fight among themselves about ideology, that's their 
business, but they shouldn't drag the rest of us into these struggles with 
a lot of propaganda and study meetings. We're tired of it and resent it."<p>

"But aren't people now a little warier than they used to be, because of 
the recent political crackdown?"<p>

"Even though things loosened up over the past few years, people have 
become fearful again about stepping too obviously over official 
boundaries," my friend's sister acknowledged. "Before the student 
demonstrations people were much more careless. Now, at least in public, 
most people have started to act obedient to the Party again, even though 
they no longer believe in it. Although the situation is still nowhere near 
as bad as it was during the Cultural Revolution, everyone knows that a 
wrong move could still affect their lives. After all, who doesn't remember 
the past? Several people in our office had parents and friends who 
committed suicide during the Cultural Revolution after they were accused 
of being rightists and capitalist-roaders."<p>

The naivete of such old-fashioned propagandizing was sublime. Rather than 
winning adherents, the Party propaganda organs had become huge, 
self-defeating engines of disaffection, which caused more and more of the 
very young Chinese whose support the leadership needed to react almost 
automatically against anything the Party supported. Far from aspiring to, 
or being proud of, Party membership, a growing number of young Chinese now 
wished to distance themselves as much as possible from the Party. Although 
many ambitious young people worked for and maintained membership, often 
they did so simply because advancement was impossible in the ranks of 
government or in state-owned enterprises without it, and because it 
frequently provided them with valuable perks such as the use of cars, 
better housing, and opportunities for travel. But, particularly among 
China's new, foreign educated elite, there was a growing sense that what 
was important was not the Party but the outside world, with which they 
increasingly identified.<p>

By expunging from their midst people like Fang Lizhi and shortly 
thereafter the dissident writers Liu Binyan and Wang Ruowang, the older 
leaders of the Party may have enjoyed a temporary illusion of 
purification, but actually they were just isolating themselves further 
from the very sources of support they so urgently needed for credibility. 
In fact, when it came to questions of trust--the fundamental bond between 
a government and its people--it was rare to find anyone, particularly in 
intellectual circles, who still put much faith in the justice or fairness 
of the Party. The Chinese Communist Party of 1987 was indeed a far cry 
from that of the days when Party membership conferred on a Chinese the 
highest social status imaginable and when the Party's leadership was 
looked up to with blind reverence.<p>

The Party, though still awesomely powerful, had been cut down in stature 
both because of its recent history and because Chinese now had alternative 
avenues of advancement. For instance, one could go into business for 
oneself or go abroad to study and live. Or one could stay home and sink 
into a more or less individualistic life of self-interest, if not 
"self-fulfillment." One of the reasons that Fang made the political 
establishment so nervous was that he was contributing to the creation of 
exactly these new dimensions of life that fell outside the Party's aegis. 
He was helping to create an ethos in which dissent was not only thinkable 
but laudable. So it must have been infuriating, not to say alarming, for 
Party hard-liners to learn that after his expulsion Fang received an 
avalanche of sympathetic mail.<p>

"It was very heartwarming to get so many expressions or support," Fang 
told me. "Some addressed their notes simply to 'Fang Lizhi, Beijing,' and 
still they got to me! But my wife and I were particularly touched by those 
people who sent postcards on which they not only expressed their outrage 
about my loss of job and ouster from the Party but also signed their names 
and wrote their return addresses, as if to defy the censors and show them 
that they refused to be cowed into silence."<p>

Then, with a bemused but satisfied smile, Fang added, "There was a great 
flood of these letters in late January and February, right after my 
expulsion. Then, after they had slowly tapered off, a curious thing 
happened. Suddenly a whole new wave began to arrive. And this time what 
people wrote was much more complex. Their letters did not simply express 
sympathy or outrage at my expulsion but contained longer comments on what 
I had been saying about democracy. At first I couldn't figure out what was 
going on. Then it dawned on me. They were triggered by the Party's 
circulation of my speeches for criticism." Fang gave one of his guileless 
laughs.<p>

When I asked Fang if he would consider joining the Party a third time, he 
sat for a while without speaking, as if he were pondering a riddle. 
Finally he said, "Well, should that moment ever arrive, I would first want 
to see what the situation was like at the time. I certainly don't feel 
that it is up to me to reform myself. But if the Party changes, well, then 
I might consider rejoining it."<p><br>


<b>FANG REAPPEARS</b><p>

Once purged from the party, Fang Lizhi and the writers Liu Binyan and Wang 
Ruowang disappeared for a while from public view, although hardly from the 
consciousness of Chinese intellectuals. Of the three, Fang came in for the 
most frequent and strenuous criticism in Party propaganda, being accused 
of having almost single-handedly incited the nationwide student 
demonstrations. Although the activities of all three men were severely 
limited, they were allowed to receive friends, to continue their work, and 
to attend certain public functions. Fang was even allowed to go abroad for 
a scientific meeting. But they remained in a sort of limbo as the 
contending factions within the Party waged their slow-motion struggle for 
ideological supremacy and political power.<p>

Although Fang was allowed to teach a limited number of classes and to see 
friends, he was explicitly forbidden to meet any Western journalists. But 
with Fang the Party had a problem that it did not have with either Liu or 
Wang. Fang had already made frequent trips abroad, and thereby had become 
one of the very few Chinese scientists to gain recognition in foreign 
scientific circles. In fact, after his expulsion, when Westerners in 
Beijing began to refer to him as China's Sakharov (an implicit rebuke to 
pretensions that China was more open than the Soviet Union), some began 
speculating as to whether Fang might not become China's first Nobel 
laureate.<p>

Fang's situation was unique for another reason as well. When he was forced 
to leave Hefei, he had to forfeit the seat he had just won in the fall 
elections for the local district People's Congress. However, his wife, Li 
Shuxian, later won a seat in Haidian, the Beijing district in which many 
of the city's universities are situated. Taking advantage of her new 
celebrity status, she told foreign reporters that she believed the Party 
had been wrong to discharge her husband and that, in due course, history 
would "prove that he was right." In the months that followed, Li Shuxian 
came to serve as a kind of local people's advocate, speaking out about the 
injustice of her husband's situation, championing human rights, and 
protesting on behalf of her student constituents, who were frequently 
harassed with unannounced searches of their dormitories and sometimes even 
detention by security guards.<p>

On February 28 Fang made his first post-purge public appearance, in 
Beijing, when he showed up at the Fourth National Congress of the Chinese 
Physics Society to deliver a paper titled "Progress in Modern Cosmology." 
His return was widely reported in the Chinese press, as was the fact that 
the meeting was chaired by none other than his old friend at Keda, Guan 
Weiyan. Clearly, this was an all too self-conscious attempt by the Party 
to reassure scientists that there was now life after purgatory.<p>

In June, after Fang's application to go abroad had been approved at the 
very highest level of Party leadership, Fang was allowed to leave China 
briefly to take part in the annual meeting of the International Center for 
Theoretical Physics, being held in Trieste. He was refused permission, 
however, to go on to Great Britain for a conference commemorating the 
tercentenary of the publication of Isaac Newton's Principia. No sooner had 
Fang gotten out of China than he was descended upon by hopeful 
interviewers. Instead of holding back, Fang expounded to them on his 
political views as fearlessly as he had done the past fall in China.<p>

When his friend Tiziano Terzani, the former Beijing bureau chief for Der 
Spiegel, met with him in Italy and asked him what his next political 
target would be, Fang answered with one word: "Marxism." Terzani appeared 
surprised by his boldness, and Fang added, "That Marxism no longer has any 
worth is a truth that cannot be denied....It is a thing of the 
past--useful to understand problems of the last century, but not those of 
today....It is like a worn-out dress that should be discarded." When asked 
what successes he would attribute to the Chinese Communist Revolution, 
Fang replied, "In China the Communist Party has never had any success. 
Over the past thirty years it has produced no positive results....That is 
why the desire for a reformation is so strong, why faith in the Party, 
especially among young people, has disappeared....In China the Party wants 
not only to manage politics but to have everything under its control as 
well, including the way people think and live....To create a real economic 
democracy in China the Party must diminish this political control-- 
precisely what it fears."<p>


When asked by Lu Keng, whose interview with Fang appeared in the overseas 
Chinese newspaper Queens Daily, why he had been allowed to go abroad while 
Liu Binyan had not been allowed to accept an invitation from the 
International Writing Program at the University of Iowa, Fang replied 
facetiously, "The country apparently needs to learn from the West only in 
science and technology, but not in the humanities." Then he went on to 
reiterate his belief that the Chinese Constitution must prevail over the 
will of the Party, and that China's future lay in striving for "freedom of 
speech and freedom of the press, among other freedoms which are provided 
for by this Constitution." He said, "For only freedom of speech will be 
able to break the tyranny of a 'one-Party voice' and bring about the 
realization of political pluralism."<p>

Surprisingly enough, after Fang's return to China there were no immediate 
political repercussions from these outspoken interviews, By last fall it 
had become clearer than ever that the punitive measures taken against 
Party intellectuals were more in the nature of a wrist-slapping than a 
full-fledged purge. The efforts of the hard-liners ended up only 
rebounding on them by imbuing their opponents with quasi-mythical status 
within China and attracting international attention to the very men whose 
ideas they wished to suppress. Last winter foreign journalists were 
suddenly writing adulatory accounts of these courageous Chinese defenders 
of free speech and democracy. The hard-liners seemed to have 
underestimated the voracious appetite of the West for Communist-bloc 
intellectuals stamped with the imprimatur of Party persecution. As the 
political climate once again warmed up, and with the behind-the-scenes 
support of certain key reform leaders, many Chinese intellectuals who had 
been in bad Party graces that winter began to leave China for tours 
abroad, where they were treated like heroes. Liu Binyan was invited to go 
to Harvard University to become a Nieman Fellow, and also won a lucrative 
book contract with an American publisher for his autobiography. Fang Lizhi 
received invitations from Cambridge and American universities to be a 
visiting scholar and had his collected speeches published in Hong Kong and 
Taiwan.<p>




When I last saw Fang last September in Beijing, I was surprised by the 
freedom with which he was allowed to socialize and go about his academic 
life. It was true that he had been forbidden to make political speeches or 
give interviews to the press, that his phone was bugged, and that his 
movements were closely watched; but it was also true that he was able to 
lead a busy life in the capital, teaching, attending scientific meetings, 
and meeting privately with friends, including some foreigners. In November 
he had even been allowed to return to Keda to deliver four lectures, 
although he was watched closely by security guards at all times.<p>

One occasion in particular illustrated the surprisingly permissive 
post-crackdown policy of the Party toward Fang. After dining with Fang and 
Li Shuxian at one of the capital's Western hotels, my wife and I 
introduced them to the NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw, who was in Beijing for 
the network's week-long series of broadcasts on China. As it happened, 
Brokaw had just the day before interviewed Zhao Ziyang, the Premier and 
acting Party General Secretary, and Zhao had spoken about Fang's situation 
at some length in what appeared to be yet another effort to reassure the 
outside world that Fang and other Chinese intellectuals would not have 
their freedom circumscribed any further. Upon meeting Fang, Brokaw asked 
him if he would like to see the tape of the Zhao interview, which was not 
scheduled to be shown on Chinese television.<p>

In what was surely one of the most unusual experiences of my many years in 
China, we soon found ourselves sitting in an NBC screening room, watching 
China's head of state speak to China's number-one dissident via an 
American network-news interview. Even stranger than the situation itself 
was what Zhao was saying about Fang.<p>


"Recently some Communist Party members were expelled from the Party, while 
others were persuaded to leave the Party," Zhao told Brokaw amiably, 
taking periodic swigs from a glass of Qingdao beer, which did not appear 
on the televised interview. "Maybe some people in the U.S. view this as a 
crackdown, as oppression against intellectuals. I do not agree. I think 
probably you are already familiar with the name of Mr. Fang Lizhi." As 
Zhao spoke his name, I glanced over at Fang, who sat bolt upright, as if 
at attention. He had a slight smile on his lips and a nonplussed 
expression on his face, and was utterly absorbed in what Zhao was saying. 
"He is a professor and a well-accomplished physicist. Over the last few 
years he has made many remarks and speeches and written articles 
criticizing the Chinese government and the policies of our Party. 
Sometimes he has even referred to the leadership in our country. He 
delivered such speeches at universities and also at other places. But he 
is still working in a very important post, and not long ago he even went 
abroad for an international academic conference. Moreover, recently he 
gave an interview to two journalists from Taiwan. [They had been the first 
journalists in some four decades to visit the mainland from Taiwan.] But 
he still maintains his original position and ideas. He was a Party member 
in the past. However, since he has such beliefs, he could no longer remain 
a Communist Party member. However, he is still an intellectual and a 
scientist, and is, moreover, respected for this. As such, he is still able 
to play his role in scientific and technological areas."<p>

Going on to draw a distinction between the obligations of intellectuals 
who are Party members and those who are not, Zhao said, "If one joins the 
Party, one has to observe the regulations, the Party Constitution, and the 
Party program....If someone cannot observe them, he will be asked to 
leave....I think the Party itself should have the freedom to decide 
whether someone should remain in or not. But when intellectuals leave the 
Party, they will still be respected and will still be able to play their 
own roles in their own [professional] capacities. I don't think you could 
call this a crackdown."<p>

Zhao spoke with confidence and conviction, and his words seemed so 
reassuring that it was difficult to remember that even though he had given 
his word the previous winter that Party harassment of intellectuals would 
cease, another wave of punitive action had followed that summer.<p>

Although heartened by Zhao's new moderation and doubtless also by the way 
Party reformers had managed to bring China back from what seemed to be the 
brink, Fang remained uncompromising in his attitude about the need for 
democracy in China. When I asked him what his own generation might leave 
by way of a legacy to China's youth, he replied simply "That communism 
doesn't work. Although one cannot say that every sentence of 
Marxism-Leninism is wrong, one must admit that its basics are incorrect."<p>

"Are there any Marxist true believers left in the Party?" I asked.<p>

"They are very few. The whole atmosphere in China now is very bad. There 
is no morality or religion, or, for that matter, anyone in charge of our 
moral education. Formerly, the Party did this to some extent, but now 
belief in the Party and Marxism has literally collapsed. When you ask 
young people what they believe in, they tell you that they don't know. 
They have lost confidence in contemporary Chinese culture. They have 
nothing to be proud of. Except for those young people who are still 
idealistic because they have started to turn to democracy, there is a 
cultural and political vacuum."<p>

"Do you put any hope in the Party's reform-minded leaders?"<p>

"Perhaps there are a few who are idealistic, but on the whole they are 
primarily concerned with the question of power.<p>

When I continued to press Fang as to whether he truly doubted that there 
was any hope for reform from within, he finally relented a bit. "Even if 
the leaders are not sincere, we must accept that this is the way things 
are going to be," he said. "One cannot say that success is absolutely 
impossible. But for now since the Chinese Communist Party is all there is 
in power and there are no other democratic channels open, we can only 
allow these leaders to lead and hope for the success of the reformers."<p>

Then, brightening somewhat, he added, "The Chinese Communist Party now 
finds itself in a curious kind of competition with Gorbachev and his idea 
of glasnost. The two socialist countries now seem to be vying with each 
other to see which one can be most open and, by analogy, be most modern. 
China's Party leaders do not want to seem to be outdone by Gorbachev, 
particularly since some people have likened my situation to that of the 
Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov, and his situation has now improved so 
greatly. As far as I am concerned, this kind of competition is a very good 
thing not only for me but for Chinese intellectuals and China in general. 
The hard reality is that there is no way now to get the Chinese Communist 
Party out of power. To try to replace them, or even to persuade them to 
adopt some other political system, is impossible. This is the difference 
between dissidence in China and in the West--that dissident opposition can 
aspire completely to replace certain leaders. So now most Chinese feel 
that the only way to move forward is to hope that the Communist Party will 
be able to change its direction and do well by the country. Maybe the next 
generation will use different tactics and changed political forms, but 
this will be up to them. Right now, such things are impossible."<p>

In November, when the Thirteenth Party Congress closed, with the 
reform-minded Zhao Ziyang firmly ensconced as Party General Secretary and 
with the Maoist hard-liners once again at bay, many Chinese intellectuals 
heaved a sigh of relief. As the student demonstrations and the ensuing 
expulsions of Fang and his colleagues receded from memory, and as official 
publications from the Party became refoliated with calls for political 
reforms and democratization, it did indeed appear that China had completed 
yet another of its seemingly endless political circles. In February of 
1988 Fang was given a promotion from fourth to second rank of 
professorship and the Party allowed him to grant a short interview to The 
New York Times. Liberal friends who only the winter before had been gloomy 
about the prospect for political reform in China were now filled with a 
new optimism.<p>

But, chastened by the many earlier abortive reform efforts, Fang remained 
skeptical about the future. When asked by the Hong Kong journal Baixing 
Banyue Kan how he viewed the outcome of the Congress and Zhao's clearly 
reform-minded speech to the Party, he replied, "It is true that Zhao's 
report was very stirring. But in his own time Mao Zedong made speeches 
that were even more stirring." After citing a host of ways in which the 
Party continued to conduct itself in an undemocratic fashion, Fang went on 
to warn, "It's not enough just to read of speeches in newspapers. One must 
always keep one's eye on reality...There are still just too many examples 
of authorities saying one thing but doing another."<p>

<blockquote>


	<font size=5>C</font>OUNTING only those earthquakes that register a magnitude of 2.0 or greater on
the Richter scale, there are more than two quakes a day, on average, in the
lower forty-eight states. Although it takes a quake of 5.5 or greater to cause
significant damage to buildings, a 2.0 quake will still give a rude jolt to
people within a few miles of its epicenter.<p>

The states along the Pacific coast, of course, have the highest concentration
of quakes, because the fault lines that run through this region constitute a
boundary between two giant tectonic plates: the North American plate and the
Pacific plate. Four of the five largest quakes during the twenty-year period
covered by this map were in California or off its coast.<p>

But seismic activity is also common in places far away from this plate
boundary. A prominent band of earthquakes extends northward from Nevada to
Montana, in a zone between deformed rocks and stable rocks which has been
active periodically for the past 600 million years. Another band of earthquake
activity extends westward from Yellowstone National Park. The cause of these
earthquakes, and of the unusual volcanic activity at Yellowstone, is the
presence of a "hot spot"--a pipe of molten rock that blasts its way up to the
surface. (Pressure from this molten rock was so intense from 1923 to 1984 that
it gradually raised the park's elevation by three feet.) <p>

Earthquakes that occur east of the Rocky Mountains are probably associated with
ancient geological structures formed as a result of past plate-tectonic
activity. For example, 600 million years ago North America attempted to split
apart into two continents along the present location of the Mississippi River,
and as a result the crust is cut by thousands of ancient faults. A prominent
zone of activity near the border between Missouri and Tennessee produced three
of the most violent earthquakes on record, in 1811 and 1812. New England, which
is characterized by persistent but scattered quakes, has experienced at least
two quakes of 6.0 or greater since the early 1800s. Although most
earthquake-related attention focuses on the West Coast, it is entirely possible
that the country's next major quake may strike somewhere in the East.<p>

Is any part of the country safe from earthquakes? Judging by data from the past
three centuries, the safest places are eastern Texas and Florida.

<blockquote>

	

	<font size=5>B</font>Y tradition the poet laureate of Great Britain annually

receives not only a stipend of 70 pounds but also the value of a tierce

(forty-two U.S. gallons) of wine, paid in cash at seventeenth-century prices,

and, famously, a butt of sack (that is, 130 gallons of it). This is the sort of

arrangement--by turns quaint, feudalistic, and humane--that we have for

centuries been conditioned to expect from Britain. And yet there are signs that

such arrangements are being eroded. It used to be that servants at Buckingham

Palace received a free supply of hand soap; now, the palace has announced, the

servants will instead receive an extra 15 pounds a year. It used to be

that those who served at royal social functions were allowed to take home two

miniature bottles of liquor on each occasion; now they will instead receive an

extra 45 pounds a year. Even the poet laureate, Ted Hughes, seems to have

his eye on the cash. Last year, according to a newspaper report, he made known

his intention to sell his butt of sack at 4 pounds the bottle, the vintage

to be marketed under the name Laureate's Choice. Wisely, I think, Hughes seems

not to have followed through on this scheme.<p>

There is something fundamentally honest and compelling about economic exchanges

"in kind," in which the value of goods or services is calibrated at least in

part in terms other than monetary. Such exchanges are the economic version of

the judicial sentencing that consigns criminals to grimly appropriate

activities (crooked slumlord must live in his own building; crooked speculator

must teach high school economics) rather than to time in jail. Money can be

delusory. It is a commonplace that the value of one currency relative to

another can cause a country's exports or imports to surge, even though nothing

about the exported or imported products themselves has actually changed. In

contrast, transactions in which the ancient idea of barter plays a role put

more of a premium on true equivalence. And there are many indications that,

despite what may be happening to feudal vestiges in Britain, the world economic

system is finding barter to be congenial in more and more instances--for

governments, for corporations, and for individuals. By one estimate, some 20

percent of the world's economic transactions are now in the form of barter

deals, up from only about five percent thirty years ago. In the American

domestic economy the value of barter deals is growing by about 15 percent a

year.<p>



One of the biggest barter transactions in history took place in 1990 between

PepsiCo and Russia: a $3 billion exchange of cola syrup for Stolichnaya vodka.

To assist hurricane victims in Florida and Hawaii, a broker several years ago

arranged for the exchange of 500 Fujitsu laser printers for 1.7 million "meals

ready-to-eat" left over from the Gulf War. The government of Peru is settling

some of its debt to overseas creditors with iron pellets, fish meal, copper

wire, and alpaca cloth. The slow thaw in relations between North and South

Korea has been helped along by a barter arrangement involving flour and zinc.

There now seems to be a potential barter aspect to almost everything. A 1991

survey by an organ-donation network sampled opinion on whether organ providers

or their families might barter body parts for funeral services, or whether

people who agreed to become organ donors might be given preferential placement

on waiting lists in the event that they themselves needed a replacement. In

Israel last year the country's gravediggers sought a labor agreement

stipulating that workers receive two grave sites for every five years of

service. <p>

Barter is, of course, deeply primitive, which may account for a measure of its

enduring appeal. But these days something else is also at work. In his

illuminating new book <i>The Construction of Social Reality</i> (1995) the

philosopher John R. Searle draws a distinction between "brute" facts, which are

facts that are simply facts (such as that Mount Everest exists, or that the sun

is 93 million miles from Earth), and "institutional" facts, which are facts

only as long as we all concede that they are facts (such as that marriage is

real, or that there is something called private property and something called

human rights, or that a person is a citizen of a particular country). Barter is

a product of a brute-fact world: I have wheat, you have cows--let's trade.

Barter's lineal descendant, money, inhabits the realm of institutional fact: it

has value only because we agree that it does. Institutional fact, Searle points

out, is the glory of our species, the very basis of cultural progress. Of

course, institutional fact is also inherently fragile--the first thing to go as

a society becomes less stable. Searle observes sourly, "One of the most

fascinating--and terrifying--features of the era in which I write this is the

steady erosion of acceptance of large institutional structures around the

world."<p>



It is when institutional fact seems to be coming unraveled that brute fact

reasserts its importance. Imagine a world in which new countries with laughable

currencies materialize almost monthly; in which ruinous inflation here and

there radically warps individual and mass behavior; in which companies and

citizens alike accrue benefit from economic activity that occurs in the

shadows--imagine such a world and it is not hard to understand the resurgence

of barter.<p>



<center>* * * * *</center><p>



In between barter and what we now think of as money there used to be a step in

which bits of paper were actually promissory notes ("Pay the bearer . . .")

that could in theory be redeemed for some valuable commodity, such as gold or

silver. These notes fell into the category known as contract money. The United

States abandoned contract money when it went completely off the gold standard,

in 1971, and Irecall a slight sensation at the time of having slipped a

mooring. Indeed, I still miss the assurance that our currency is supported by

something other than the full faith and credit of the United States of America.

<p>



One wonders: Would it not be a confidence-building gesture in this uncertain

age if major world currencies were once again pegged to commodities of

relatively stable worth, thereby re-endowing money with some of barter's simple

ballast? For the United States an obvious opportunity presents itself early

this year, when the most significant overhaul of U.S. currency in six decades

is scheduled to begin. The overhaul, prompted by the need for new designs that

can foil counterfeiters, is to begin with the $100 bill, followed at

half-yearly to yearly intervals by the other bills in descending order of

value.<p>



I would propose that, coincident with the new design, the U.S. Treasury peg the

new $100 bill to the value of a commodity whose worth in the national affection

gives promise of constancy--for instance, a pair of Nike Air Jordan athletic

shoes. Henceforward, no matter what happened to the value of America's money,

that $100 bill--a "Jordan" or "J-note," as we'd no doubt eventually come to

call it--would always be good for a pair of Nikes. Walk into a store with a

J-note in A.D. 2005 or 2025 and you'll walk out with the shoes. On the

redesigned bank note itself, to drive the point home, athletic shoes would

replace the traditional arrows and olive branch in the American eagle's claws.

<p>



Along similar principles, the new $50 bill, which will probably be introduced

later this year, could be pegged forever to the value of four seats in a

major-league ballpark (and an engraving of Doubleday Field, in Cooperstown,

could grace the reverse side). The $20 bill could be redeemed for a tankful of

gas for an American-made compact car. The $10 bill would be exchangeable for

Big Macs and small drinks for a family of four. The $5.00 bill would always be

good for a paperback edition of any nineteenth-century novel. The $1.00 bill

would allow you to talk to your mother on the phone from anywhere in the world

for one minute. If that is impracticable, then it should at least always get

you a decent cup of coffee. Although there are no immediate plans to redesign

the $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and $100,000 bills, I am certain that

imaginative equivalences can be found for them as well. I would be grateful, for

instance, if the value of the last of these denominations could be locked in as

the equivalent of the cost of four years of education at a private college or

university. The image of Woodrow Wilson on the $100,000 bill might be replaced

by that of John Harvard or Lord Jeffrey Amherst. <p>



No monetary system is perfect, and this one will reveal flaws as time goes on.

Inflation will still be possible, though it will take a more visible and

immediately annoying form (for instance, the form of shrinking Big Macs, gas

tanks, and semesters) than it often does at present. But in a world where

money's value can change by the nanosecond and its physical reality can be no

more substantial than an electronic impulse, some compensating loss of

abstraction would surely be welcome. And for $6.00, a cup of coffee and

<i>Treasure Island</i> will always be a good deal.<p>

RANCE makes a good touchstone for America's future policies. The political

system of the French republic is not incomparably different from ours. Recently

France has been governed by politicians who, no matter what they have called

themselves, have been basically careful and rather traditional. France has

fought two disastrous postcolonial wars, in Vietnam and in Algeria, which

gained it nothing but a vast number of new immigrants whom it is now trying to

absorb in the teeth of increasing local hostility and racism. But France's view

of what national politics will be about in the years ahead seems about as far

removed from ours as is possible between two Western nations.</font><p>

I spent much of last spring in France, talking to a variety of people whose

jobs made them experts in one field or another. Many of them were

professionally involved in the <a href="http://mosaique.oleane.com/elysee/eng/candidats/">presidential campaign</a>, a few of them to the

point where the future of their jobs depended on its outcome. Yet they were to

a surprising degree detached from the personalities and politics of the main

candidates, Jacques Chirac, Lionel Jospin, Edouard Balladur, Jean-Marie Le Pen,

and Robert Hue.<p>



Most of them were <i>fonctionnaires</i> at the highest level of civil service,

men and women who actually make policy. This is a class of people of whom the

United States has very few. Their views of the future had a considerable unity,

which made it somewhat pointless after a meeting to wonder if the views aired

had been leftist, centrist, or rightist. They were also blessedly free of

political rhetoric. Hubert Astier, the former <i>directeur de cabinet </i>for

the Minister of Culture, for instance, did not mention the person of his

minister at all in a two-hour conversation, and when, toward the end, I finally brought the minister up as a

subject, it became quite clear that that man was not highly relevant to the

future of the policies we had been discussing.<p>

More than other Western European countries, and more even than the United

States, France has embraced modern technology in daily life with enthusiasm.

Forget the clich&eacute;s about a French scene consisting of berets, loaves of

fresh bread, long lunches, intuition, improvisation, and bad telephones. Those

images are as outdated as the concept of France as an agricultural nation. Only

five percent of the French now grow food (in the United States it is about

three percent). People who have jobs work very hard, under the threatening

shadow of the more than three million unemployed. This is a modern nation, for

better and for worse, and the technical accoutrements of life are state of the

art.<p>



The United States is still a pioneer in technological invention; France is

ahead of us in application. This is because France does not wait for market

forces to test the profitability of new ways and ideas but uses the state to

try them out. Sometimes this works beautifully (public transport, the Minitel),

sometimes it does not (the Concorde, a plan for a ubiquitous network of optic

cable, the Gare Montparnasse--the only railroad station I've ever known in

which I had to ask the way to the ticket windows). Its most obvious daily

aspect is a smoothness, described to me as the government's feeling for the

amenities, "a sort of high-



level

pleasure principle" that makes life easier; that, and the neatness of city and

country--in a phrase, the quality of life. According to the figures of the

<a href="http://www.cnrs.fr/">Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</a>, a government body, France spends

four times as much per person on its infrastructure as our federal  and state

governments combined.<p>



Paradoxically (at least to those here in the United States who maintain that

art and culture are elitist pursuits, outside the real world, and of no concern

to the state), France combines its techno-enthusiasms

with an enthusiasm for government support of the national culture. In this

context "culture" is to be read in the widest possible sense, embracing the

fine arts; book, magazine, and newspaper publishing; television; cinema;

architecture; music; language and the traditional crafts; and even certain

caf&eacute;s. Support of the arts is increasingly seen as a social tool: in the

shapeless and unfocused poor suburbs the government tries to give structure to

life by putting up money for cinemas, for bookshops (and, of course,

libraries), and for <i>caf&eacute;s-musique</i>. In neighborhoods too

disoriented to have even one normal (French) caf&eacute;, the state pays to

start caf&eacute;s that regularly present live music. In 1993 it established

twelve, last year sixty more, and this year another sixty. We aren't talking

here of the kinds of handouts that make our congressional leaders so angry; we

are dealing with national initiatives.<p>



Jack Lang told me last spring that when he was Minister of Culture, his answer

to American journalists who suggested that such policies threatened the

independence of artists used to be "They are independent not in spite of but

because of government support." I have met no serious man or woman in my

travels who questioned the <i>vertu organisatrice</i>, the organizing virtue,

of the state. France is a world removed from the idea of the state as a

necessary (or even an unnecessary) evil.<p>





The technology-culture tandem has a surprising twist: in strongly traditional areas of the country the

emphasis usually lies on technological innovation; in more-radical regions

there is a new passion for the arts. Thus the once royalist, anti-revolutionary

part of the Vend&eacute;e is now a high-tech center, and the formerly pro-revolution

Protestant zone is filled with devotees of Breton language and Breton

literature.<p>

<font size=5>I</font>N 1983 <a href="http://www.francetelecom.com/

">France Telecom</a>, the state phone company, began the free distribution of

<a href="http://www.minitel.fr/index.html

">Minitels</a>--small "videotex" home terminals, measuring seven by four and a half

inches. They give access to a master computer holding every telephone number in

France, cross-indexed

in several ways, and also to ever more services and ads. At the time, they were

nothing more than "a stunt to increase telephone traffic," to quote a

<i>fonctionnaire</i> from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

There are now seven million in use, two thirds of them in households, which

means that one in five households has one. There is also a Minitel in every

post office. The simplest model remains completely free; more-sophisticated

ones appear on the phone bill at twenty francs a month and up (about $4.00; all

dollar amounts in this article are based on a five-franc dollar).<p>

 

 			<img src="./cafe.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="">





 

As for the telephone service itself, it is every bit as good as service in the

United States, and when I visited a France Telecom office to become a

subscriber, I was given a number, a phone, and an answering machine within

minutes. I was immediately listed on the national Minitel, and no money was

asked of me up front. Telephone booths are now abundant, most of them for use

with phone cards, and most, bless them, with real doors. I might be able to

conjure up some nostalgia for the old telephone office in Cannes where I often

sat in the middle of the night (because of the time difference), waiting for

the lady at the desk to call out, <i>"L'Am&eacute;rique, cabine trois!"</i> The

office never closed, and one was trusted to pay afterward. I definitely do not

miss the bars in which one had to buy a phone token--and preferably also a

coffee--before descending to the pay phones beside the toilets.<p>



Last year advertising on the Minitel generated $2 billion in sales--not a vast

amount on a nationwide scale. But its importance lay elsewhere: it made a large

number of people in France computer-minded.

(I'm not so sure this is an unmixed blessing, and there is something aggressive

in that little box and its dehumanized services.)<p>



The flip side of France's love affair with modern technology is perhaps a

weakness in its ecological movement. Three quarters of the country's

electricity comes from nuclear reactors, and there has been no serious

discussion of this since 1973 (when several people were killed in a melee

during a protest demonstration at a reactor near Grenoble). Given the warlike

situation in the Middle East, France, which has very little oil or natural gas,

must not be without an independent energy source: this was one reason often

given to me, in combination with the reminder that France has been invaded

three times by its neighbor Germany. "As long as there is a Germany, pacifism

and its offspring ecology won't have much of a footing here," I was told by a

former minister (who did not want to be quoted by name). I doubt the logic of

that "offspring" idea, but I can see what he meant. These are feelings that the

European Union has not erased. Also, the statistics on French nuclear power

show no accident that ever caused even one death. The nuclear establishment

runs a secretive ship, though, and I'd guess that not even Fran&ccedil;ois

Mitterrand, in his fourteen years as President, would necessarily have been

told of any such accident. President Chirac's recent insistence on nuclear

testing in the face of universal protest carried this attitude to an extreme,

but in various polls two thirds of the French declared themselves against the

tests. Chirac may have inadvertently created a new awareness in his country of

nuclear dangers. <p>



France's energy policies do have green aspects. <a href="http://www.edf.fr">Electricit&eacute; de France</a>,

for instance, has a scheme whereby on certain days during the winter months a

little red light goes on at about 7:00 A.M., in whatever room the customer has

chosen for it, signaling that a peak day in electricity use is expected. To

deal with the big problem of peak demand without having to build new

generators, the French utility offers its customers a plan under which they pay

about half the regular price for each kilowatt-hour used--except on twenty-two

days a year, chosen by the company, when those same customers must pay five

times the regular price. That red light in the morning warns that such a day is

upon them, and then it becomes economical--or, if you will, good sport, or an

act of solidarity--to reduce power use on that day by not ironing, not using

the dryer, and so forth.<p>



If one is willing to play this game, the savings over the year are

considerable. Enough people have indeed been willing for this bit of social

engineering to work, and so far it has saved the country a lot of expense and

new pollution. (As of now France Telecom and Electricit&eacute; de France are

still government-owned.)<p>



The most direct, daily way in which state-



initiated

technology affects life in France is through mass transport. The social system,

which has taken the financial anguish out of being ill (totally) and out of

being old (to a degree), has profoundly changed the way people look at and live

their lives. Yet, in a simple how-do-you-start-your-day manner, <a href="http://metro.jussieu.fr:10001/">

the

M&eacute;tro, the R&eacute;seau Express R&eacute;gional (RER)</a>, and the French

national railroad (SNCF) have a more direct impact. When I consider the grind

most people in the United States have to go through getting to and from

work--the waste, the weariness, the antagonisms experienced--I am jealous

indeed of what the French are offered. The M&eacute;tro, the Paris subway, runs

in a bright environment and there is virtually no waiting; those trains just

keep coming. In the same time that it took my home town, New Haven, to patch up

its shabby railroad station, the RER of the Ile de France (more than 4,600

square miles in the heartland, including Paris and its suburbs) built an entire

express rail system, the bulk of it underground, <i>below</i> the M&eacute;tro

network, which moves a million and a half passengers daily from as far away as

Etampes (thirty miles from Paris) and St. Cyr (eighteen miles). As for the

mainline trains run by the SNCF, journeys on them are a pleasurehard as this

must be for New York and New England "Metro North" victims to believe, not to

mention passengers on the unspeakable Amtrak.<p>



One day in the Gare d'Austerlitz, in Paris, I asked at a window when the next

train to Orl&eacute;ans was coming, and the woman on duty looked a bit puzzled.

<i>"Tout le temps,"</i> was her answer. There are forty trains a day: no need

to check on the next one; another would have arrived by the time I got to the

platform. Orl&eacute;ans is as far from Paris as New Haven is from New York,

seventy-odd miles, but an Orl&eacute;anist can commute: his train takes

fifty-five minutes, the New Haven train nearly two hours.<p>



Then there is the <a href="http://mercurio.iet.unipi.it/tgv/indexold.html">TGV, <i>train &agrave; grande vitesse</i></a>, which has given

traveling by rail a new lease on life, far into the next century. The TGV

network of special track in France is 4,400 miles. In the year 2005 it will

have become a European network of 9,700 miles, with the new Channel tunnel as

one of its focal points. The commercial speed of those trains is 186 mph, and

will be boosted to 220 mph. (The speed record, established in 1990 by the TGV

<i>Atlantique</i>, is 320 mph.) The trains run so smoothly that you can write a

letter in your seat and drink coffee or soup (both of which are served) without

spilling.<p>



Since we now seem to accept that Americans are unwilling to contribute to

something that profits only others, I hasten to add that the TGV is more than

self-



supporting.

New York to Washington with two stops would take an hour and twenty minutes,

Boston to New York just over an hour. And that's center to center, which in the

United States would mean new life for the depressed areas around most train

terminals. The rate at which the French system has been built is particularly

impressive to an American: Amtrak has been "experimenting" with a ten-



mile

high-



speed

stretch somewhere up north for a decade now. New York's Bruckner Boulevard has

been "under construction" since I was in college. Have the days when European

visitors goggled at our zap gone forever?<p>



From the sixties on, railroads have been anathema in Washington. The standing

joke in Ronald Reagan's Department of Transportation was, If someone insists on

traveling by train, we'll just give him a free plane ticket--it'll be cheaper

that way. Thus the United States is hopelessly missing out on this new mode of

transport. Ironically, American financial institutions right now own at least

twelve complete TGV trains, because in an international tax maneuver the SNCF

sold them to America and then immediately leased them back.

<font size=5>T</font>HE France I am writing about is no demi-paradise.

My purpose is to see how the French are <i>coping</i>, coping with less than

paradisiacal circumstances. The great despoiler in France, as almost everywhere

else, is unemployment. Contrary to what some politicians pretend to think, very

few people prefer state support to working. My proof: in France (just as here)

any halfway decent job opening attracts dozens of applicants--thirty-five for

each advertised sales job, twenty for each post as a bank clerk, fifty for each

job as a hospital worker. The French jobless rate last summer was just under 12

percent, higher even than the Western European median of 10 percent. In the

United States unemployment is only about six percent, but the cause of it is

the same as in Europe: not enough new service jobs to make up for the losses in

industry and agriculture, for the growing population, and for the number of

women now trying to find work. France has so many job-training schemes, state-



assisted

jobs, and other programs that people are motivated to stay in the system longer

and to keep on trying. Just the <i>mesures jeunes</i>, for those under twenty-



five,

include twelve different national programs. This makes the statistics look even

worse.<p>



The term for the jobless in France is no longer <i>les ch&ocirc;meurs</i> ("the

unemployed") or <i>les nouveaux pauvres</i> ("the recent poor") but <i>les

exclus</i> ("those who are out of it"). Lack of money, lack of decent housing,

are only the symptoms. The disease is the lack of a role in society. The

afflicted are de-



integrated,

locked out, if not outcasts. <i>Exclusion</i> is now the number-one general

fear of the French (along with AIDS). What are they doing about it?<p>



The length of time an <i>exclu</i> gets unemployment benefits (which come from

les Caisses, a fund paid into by everyone who works) depends on the recipient's

age and the number of months he or she has worked so far. The benefits are a

percentage of the last salary earned, and they are reduced in stages until they

stop altogether, after a maximum period of sixty months. At that point payments

that are independent of previous earnings, just like welfare in the United

States, kick in. They come directly from the state. A single person in France

gets about $460 a month in welfare, a couple $690. On top of that come child

allowances and, for some, rent support. But in order to qualify if one has

never held a job at all (a situation now quite frequent), one must be over

twenty-



five

or have the care of a child.<p>



Notwithstanding the rhetoric from politicians both for and against the

"welfare state," the systems of France and, say, New York or Massachusetts are

at this writing not all that different. But there is one essential difference,

it seems to me: being on welfare in France is seen not as a failure of the

individual but as a failure of society. I realize that this is a generalization

I cannot prove with data. But state aid to French people who need it is never

questioned--not even by the most extreme right-



wingers,

who focus on immigration and foreigners on welfare.<p>



Of course, the whole miserable business of joblessness and being on welfare

plays in a different social climate in France, where education is free all the

way through the university, health care is largely free, low-



rent

housing is not just in ghettos but all over the place, far-reaching "social

discounts" are given on mass transit and train tickets, and more. Why is this

possible, and why do conservatives talk about economizing but never about

abolishing it all? I will get back to that. In the meantime, it must be said

that the malaise of unemployment is in the air in France as much as or more

than in Americaeven if the beggars, not seen in such numbers in a century, are

as a rule North Africans or genuine or pretend Gypsies from Eastern Europe.<p>



Automation, a shift from coal and steel to electrons and tape, and the

internationalization of enterprises are what caused this misery in the first

place, and I agree with economists who tell us that there are only a couple of

real remedies: social jobs and a shortening of the workweek. (Indeed, all the

French job-training schemes and <i>mesures jeunes</i> have not made much of a

dent.) The social jobs they are talking about are not fringe jobs; on the

contrary, they are crucially needed. They just don't turn anyone a direct

profit, and they don't come about by themselves, in the classic Adam Smith

manner. There are jobs caring for the ever larger number of old people, and

jobs in schools, in health care, in sports, in parks, in the environment. The

state, or the community, pays. Some of the job descriptions, I admit, are not

much more than euphemisms for street sweeping (200,000 such in France). All the

same, I was repeatedly told, they are essential, and therefore not undignified.

They are needed if France is to "preserve our humanity"--to stay "convivial,"

or <i>"chaleureux."</i> A former minister and an editor of <i>Le Monde</i>,

France's paper of record, both used the latter word in speaking to me.<p>



"We did without that in the thirties," the editor said, "for all sorts of good

reasons. The result was fascism. Never again." (In <a href="../chilearn/drucker.htm">November of 1994</a> a

contributor to <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> pleaded for such an initiative by

the United States --and indeed some cities are trying it--but he wanted it

turned over to the Church, and to hospitals: that seemed a rather Dickensian

idea to me.) <p>



Shortening the workweek as a way of creating more jobs has been accepted by

Volkswagen in Germany. In 1981 Mitterrand shortened the French workweek from

forty to thirty-nine hours, without reducing wages, but stopped there. During

the recent presidential campaign only the Socialist candidate, Lionel Jospin,

had it on his program--a cut to thirty-seven hours, with further reductions to

come. To the astonishment of the pollsters, who had been wrong without

exception, Jospin came out first in the April 24 election results; but in the

May 7 runoff he lost (47.36 percent to 52.64 percent) to Jacques Chirac, a

populist Conservative. The French Parliament is 80 percent Conservative, and

Jospin would have been a very frustrated President. (His share of the final

vote was all the more surprising for that. He was ahead of Chirac among the

voters younger than twenty-six, and at par with him for voters under

thirty-six.) It is safe to predict many strikes and social tensions during the

seven-year Chirac presidency, as is already being borne out.<p>



In the nineteenth century, when factory workers in Britain campaigned for a

reduction of their working day to twelve or even ten hours, employers

demonstrated with statistics that this change would precisely wipe out all

profits. It was not true. The same game is being played once more, but a slew

of recent studies, including the scholarly <i>Financement de la Protection

Sociale</i>, by Jean-



Marc

Dupuis (1994), appears to show that a shorter workweek does not make an

enterprise significantly less profitable--and that doing away with the minimum

wage, which France has too, doesn't create more jobs.<p>



I am aware of the tendency in the United States to go in the opposite

direction, for employers hold to the idea that it is more profitable (if one

blissfully ignores the social costs) to fire as many people as possible and

have the rest do overtime.<p>

<a name="RTFToC5">AMBIANCE,

WAR, AND 

</a>

<a name="RTFToC6">WHAT

IT ALL COSTS

</a></h3><p>



<font size=5>S</font>O much for the economics and the feel of a welfare state; what about the stones-



asphalt-

trees

ambiance?<p>



I heard a lot of complaining in France about the deterioration of

the towns. French people do not know how well off they still are. Here is the

basic difference between them and us: France has not suffered the flight of the

relatively well-



to-do

from city centers to the suburbs, and the ensuing horror of abandoned,

dangerous inner cities paired with bedroom communities that sail under the flag

of boredom and weary commutes. I will not forget an experience of arriving by

bus in Cincinnati at 11:00 P.M. and facing an empty, dark, <i>vanished</i>

city. Only one distant building showed light, and it turned out to be a high-



rise

parking garage, closed.<p>



Our inner cities will not be saved by the mechanics of free-market forces,

which doomed them in the first place. Possibly a city center with its personnel

living in distant suburbs makes eminent sense to a right-



thinking

computer. To us and to our children it spells a mean quality of life.<p>



A web of rules, regulations, and laws, and the money to make up for any

negative economic impact they had, were needed to keep French towns and central

Paris alive. (The same was true for the inner-



ring

city of Amsterdam.) Government had to subsidize housing repairs that tenants or

owners could not afford. Zoning had to ban an overdose of sex shops, gas

stations, parking lots, fast-food outlets, and dubious hotels. Certain

businesses and shops and services had to be kept out, others lured back. It was

a subtle process, and many mistakes were made, but it got results.<p>



I will be told, and rightly so, that all this infringes on the individual's

freedom of choice. But in the end that freedom is but the freedom to go to the

devil, and the freedom of a few superspeculators to send whole neighborhoods to

the devil.<p>



For now, France has succeeded in preserving its towns, but at the price of

exporting some of the towns' problems to the <i>banlieue</i>, poor suburbs,

where poor immigrants and the unemployed are gathering. However, France didn't

give the <i>banlieue </i>the freedom to go to the devil either. In 1990 a

Ministry of Towns was created. The government then signed state-



town

contracts to help no fewer than 1,500 "threatened areas." I have described the

building or subsidizing of schools, libraries, cinemas, and

<i>caf&eacute;s-musique </i>that goes on there. But many of the immigrants are

illegal, which means they have no steady support at all, and it is an uphill

struggle. I don't think any of the people I was in contact with in Paris

consider it a success story. When I mentioned U.S. slums, they almost proudly

mentioned La Courneuve, near Paris, which was "surely worse."<p>



One morning I went there. La Courneuve is the last station on a M&eacute;tro

line, and from it a streetcar leads to the "Cit&eacute; de 4,000," which, the

<i>Monde </i>editor had assured me, is the worst part. "I was ashamed when I

saw it," he told me. "Ashamed for this country."<p>



The Cit&eacute; is a cluster of vast apartment buildings, containing

(obviously) 4,000 apartments, which look down on a grass field and a children's

playground. Alongside the field runs the tramline to the Courneuve

M&eacute;tro. Most of the apartments have little balconies. There was no trash

on the ground, the halls didn't stink of urine, and the two elevators I saw

worked. Nothing was boarded up or broken. It wasn't great, but it did not have

the despair of the worst of New York or New Haven. How far we have sunk, I

thought, that so many in our country--which had and has such an overabundance

of resources both natural and humanwould happily settle in a development the

<i>Monde</i> editor had been ashamed of! I was ashamed of the editor's shame.<p>



How much does it cost the French to do so much for their people? That same

editor receives a monthly paycheck of about $4,600, out of which he pays $900

in income tax. Social payments (health insurance, pension fund) are withheld,

and he doesn't even know how much they are. The tax tables I took home show

that a family with two children and a gross income of $50,000 a year pays the

social payments plus $12,800 in income tax. If their income is $20,000, the tax

is $3,600. This is less than in (Conservative) Germany and about the same as in

(Conservative) England. Other taxes (value-





added sales tax, gas tax, tobacco tax) are high, though. <p>



The French used to be famous for tax dodging. I don't know if that fame was

ever justified, but it is not now; estimates of fraud there are in the same

ball park as in the law-



abiding

United States. Why do better-



off

French people not protest against paying with their taxes for other people's

food, education, and housing?<p>



Presumably they realize, first of all, that the modern alternative would be not

a lower class "keeping its place" but a jungle in which they would have as much

to lose as anyone else, if not more. An economist pointed out to me that the

higher people's income is, the more they gain from the state services financed

by their taxes: they use the hospitals, sporting fields, museums, more than

average, and their children use the educational system longer, right through

university. They live longer than the less-well-



off

and profit more from pension plans. All in all, they may actually get as much

out of the system as they put in. That conclusion seems rather illogical to me,

but there is something to the argument, which obviously is not valid in the

United States, where there is next to nothing the rich and the poor share.<p>



In another vein, Jean Gandois, the head of the Patronat Fran&ccedil;ais, the

French Employers' Center, recently asked his colleagues to think twice about

firing people. He didn't give any moral reasons; he simply reminded them that

the tax bill would eventually end up with them. <p>



But I see no reason to argue this out only in terms that take no account of

morality. The word "solidarity" may be bandied about a bit much by the French

state, and it may strike people as overly pious, but I take it seriously. There

is such a thing as a solidarity in France between the healthy and the sick, the

rich and the less rich and the poor: it's called <i>sens civique</i>. (A pupil

from one of France's great schools, the <a href="http://www.ens.fr/english.html">Ecole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure</a>, told

me that having been accepted by the school, one was already a civil servant, a

<i>fonctionnaire</i>, and received a living wage, $1,600 a month, right from

the start. In exchange one undertook to work ten years as a teacher after

graduation. "And if you don't?" I asked. She was taken aback. "That wouldn't be

very <i>civique</i>," she said.)<p>



Perhaps it took the suffering of two world wars and an enemy occupation to

crystallize this feeling. The <i>directeur de cabinet </i>in the Social Affairs

Ministry formulated it thus: In the First World War, out of 20 million men, 1.5

million were killed and two million mutilated or wounded. This created "a

lasting moral debt of the state." "Our solidarity has now become passive," he

said. "When we're okay, we feel we pay too much, but when we ourselves are in

trouble, we are proud of this security. We can never renege on this.

<i>Egalit&eacute;</i> is still a basic of the republic."<p>

</a>

<a name="RTFToC8">AND

DAILY LIFE

</a></h3>

<font size=5>I</font>N the light of all this I return to my starting point, state support: that is,

support, from all the people, for the culture and the arts of the country, for

the nonindustrial, nonbusiness, nonmaterialistic, non-



food-producing

part of national life--for its civilization. The French Ministry of Culture

spends $3 billion a year, one percent of the state budget, for this. The

communities of the country together contribute $6 billion, the Ministry of

Foreign Affairs $600 million. Other cultural ministerial projects cost $200

million (but there is a separate Ministry of Education with a separate budget).<p>



It adds up to about $10 billion (plus, of course, what is spent privately).

This is $500 per family per year--more than any other country spends. As far as

I can tell from the available statistics, this is also true in absolute terms:

$10 billion is more than any other country, regardless of its size, spends. To

put it in a modern perspective, though (lest it sound too good to be true),

that is also about what France spends on advertising.<p>



Such support for the arts is an old tradition. It used to come from the King,

the Church, and various Maecenases, going right back to the original Maecenas

(Gaius Cilnius), who paid the rent for the poet Horace around the year 30 B.C.

In France most serious Ministers of Culture of the recent past have worked in

close personal relationships with the President--Andr&eacute; Malraux with De

Gaulle, Jack Lang with Mitterrand--which gave them a lot of extra elbow room.

<p>



I've mentioned the specifically social projects, the cinemas and caf&eacute;s

for suburbs in trouble. Of course every cultural project has an artistic and a

social side, not easily separated. On the Rue Oberkampf, a rather shabby street

in Paris's eleventh arrondissement, an open space was used for a new post

office, so unusual and so beautiful that the papers called it "<i>onirique</i>"

("dreamlike"); it pulls the whole block up a mile or two. Among its simple but

astonishing innovations:a green light shines up from the surface of the

entrance road when the post office is open, a red light when it's closed. High

in the air behind it is a pedestrian bridge and a row of neat apartments for

the post-office workers. The project, designed by the young architect

Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Borel, is part of a scheme to build new post offices in

Paris that are combined with a total of 1,500 low-rent apartments for postal

workers coming from the provinces who cannot afford Paris rents. The post

offices are all different, original, and a boost to their

environments--adventures in architecture. Well, the post office in New Haven

isn't so bad either, but . . . I don't care to finish that sentence.<p>



I watched the last big television interview President Mitterrand gave before

his term was up. He was questioned mostly about his "<i>grands travaux</i>":

the Louvre pyramid, the great national library then still in the making, the

Bastille Opera, the new Music City of Paris--in all, more than thirty projects

in Paris and the provinces. (See <a href="paris.htm">"Paris Is Finished,"</a> by David Lawday, August

<i>Atlantic</i>.) "You could have built x-



thousand

new apartments with the money," his TV host remarked; Mitterrand answered that

these projects had saved a number of crafts that were dying out, irreplaceable

techniques. But above all they had given the state a new <i>&eacute;lan</i>,<i>

</i>which penetrated to every corner of national life.<p>



People I talked with in the <a href="http://dmf.culture.fr/index-en.html

">Ministry of Culture</a> wanted to distinguish between

culture and "<i>les industries culturelles</i>" (this with a glance at the

television set), which generally are very efficacious but can also come into

conflict with that "diversity which is so crucial to civilization." There was

much stress on this diversity, and on the true absence of any cultural

xenophobia that was part of it. These people reminded me that all those

<i>grands travaux</i> had been executed by the winners of competitions and that

many of them had been foreigners. (The extension to the Louvre was the only

exception; its designer was not chosen in competition but appointed. Of course,

the architect appointed by Mitterrand was the Chinese-



American

<a href="http://www.louvre.fr/louvre/francais/grandlou/pyramide.htm">I. M. Pei</a>.) <p>



At the ministry we researched diversity in the latest issue of

<a href="http://pariscope.fr/Pariscope/Welcome.E.html"><i>Pariscope</i></a>, one of the Paris weekly programs magazines. Of all the films,

concerts, and other events listed, 70 percent were of foreign origin. Contrary

to a Washington myth, films are not subject to quotas, and 70 percent of the

films shown that week were American. I was told that if too few copies of an

American film arrive to provide the little out-



of-

the-

way

cinemas, some of them subsidized by the ministry, extra copies may be made at

ministry expense. The quota fight that was so much in the news is not over

cinema but over television-network programming.<p>



At the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations the U.S. delegate

insisted that TV programs are as much merchandise as cars or cheeses. France,

alone among European countries, insisted on the unique character of certain

cultural works which could not survive unprotected in a world where the bad

drives out the good and the lowest common denominator ends up holding the field

(Gresham's Law). Some U.S. politicians, and of course Jack Valenti, of the

Motion Picture Association of America, jumped in and announced that in

resisting TV quotas we were defending democracy and the sacred rights of the

consumer. It was pointed out in the Paris <i>Herald Tribune </i>that McDonald's

had not ruined French cuisine.<p>



Actually, McDonald's has ruined a lot of the cheap and simple tables

d'h&ocirc;te France used to have, but in any case there is a lot of room in the

restaurant field, and people's choice is determined by their money; no one

suggests that all food is equally good. In the noncable television world there

is limited room only, and to reserve 50 percent of it for European, including

French, productions is precisely what cultural policy is about. (It won't last

anyway: the quota is for ten years only.)<p>



If we leave our culture to the battalions with the fattest wallets, we'll have

no need of any policy. There will always be a good market for comic books,

heavy-metal concerts, and motion pictures about murder, mayhem, and raw sex.

One may object that, well, that is what "they" want--but "they" also want

cockfights, bearbaiting, and public executions. The quotas achieve a

continuation of choice. If we don't bar Gresham's Law from some areas of

creativity, in the end everything<i> </i>will be about buying and selling, and

some of the beauty human beings may create will vanish forever, like the dodo.

I know I am stepping out of my role as a reporter here, but I consider it my

reward for defending Jack Valenti to the French when he came over to Paris and

put his foot in his mouth, as is his habit.<p>



The ministry does subsidize French films--to an extent that makes American

writers and directors throb with envy. The money is split between "first films"

and the rest. French directors are drawn to ironic movies right now--"<i>films

de derision</i>," as the <a href="gopher://agate.lut.ac.uk:4077/11/Cahiers%20du%20Cinema"><i>Cahiers du Cinema </i></a>calls them. Do they deserve

public support? Serge Toubiana, the editor of <i>Cahiers</i>, said to me, "They

present at least a different world, which you can then accept or reject--as

contrasted with the world of TV-



type

boilerplate, be it French or American, which presents an endless number of

identical propositions." <p>



The Ministry of Culture also helps the press, with special postal rates,

special phone rates, and special tax rules. By necessity, this kind of support

goes to everything, from the jazzy illustrated magazine <i>Paris-Match</i>,

which doesn't need it, to a knitting monthly. The Paris dailies, which have

fewer ads and much higher costs than the provincial dailies (which flourish),

have also been the recipients of special funding. I realize how controversial

such a program would be in the United States. "Well," said Hubert Astier, the

former <i>directeur de cabinet</i> in the Culture Ministry, "our culture must

balance the weight, the burden, of our economy. It must be an antidote to

economy"--words that could not be spoken by an American politician or even, I

think, by an American museum director.<p>



I talked with Astier about the various programs that are sent abroad and asked

if French culture wasn't actually used to promote French economic interests. "I

believe that eighty to ninety percent of what we do is `art for art's sake,'"

he answered. "Think me naive. For America we have a yearly budget of three

million dollars. This is ridiculous, compared with the economic interests

there. I'm sure one fashion designer spends more on American ads." The cultural

programs of France are not aggressive but defensive, Astier said. Culture

defended the towns, which in a Latin tradition were the sources of

civilization.<p>



I cannot help feeling that something was added to the conversations I had by

their location. These people had offices in the marvelous buildings, some of

them once genuine palaces, where ministries in Paris are housed. With Astier I

sat in a Louis XV room with a sculptured ceiling and eight-



foot-high

windows; outside was the dark blue of a Paris spring-evening sky--it was the

same room where almost thirty years earlier I had talked with Andr&eacute;

Malraux. I am sorry to say that I could not play devil's advocate and like a

good interviewer challenge Astier. I'm on his side. As a writer, I feel that

serious writers, like serious artists in general, are not producing

"merchandise" that must earn the fiat of the marketplace. The judging of art

takes generations. I think we are all, to a very, very modest degree, Van

Goghs. Vincent sold one painting in his lifetime, for a little more money than

it would have cost him to see his own 1986 exhibition in the Metropolitan

Museum.<p>



Astier talked about <a href="http://tuna.uchicago.edu/forms_unrest/ENC.query.html">Diderot's <i>Encyclop&eacute;die</i></a>, the first such work,

which summed up for the eighteenth century the knowledge of the Enlightenment,

and which, if I may quote myself from <i>The New Yorker</i> in 1981, "raised a

storm that blew away the smells of powdered wigs, love potions, and alchemists'

retorts; shook the salons of the court and the chambers of bishops and

parliamentarians still meeting in the shadow of stake and rack. . . ." "We have

started planning a new <i>Encyclop&eacute;die</i> for the final years of this

century," Astier told me. "It will be a coordination of film, publications,

museum shows, of history, art, videos, everything. Good and bad of the past. We

want to show to France `<i>the others.</i>' America, Africa, Islam. We want to

fight the fear they inspire. Our purpose will be to fight the modern fear of

`the others,' the present-



day

fear of the future." And indeed, there is a malaise in the air in this <i>fin

de si&egrave;cle</i>, in Paris as in New York; no one will later call these

years a Belle Epoque.<p>



France, which in 1945 was still rural and traditional, tried to adopt American

modernity then with a vengeance, and almost without criticism (except maybe in

Jacques Tati movies). Now the French feel uneasy. Ambition and greed are as

rampant in France as anywhere else, but there are also thoughts of solidarity,

of building a system in which money is not the absolute master dictating who

eats and who goes hungry, who is healed and who dies. That concept was one of

the good things to come out of this bloody century.<p>



France does have a social structure into which to fit modernity. Its loneliness

has some balance in the <i>sens civique</i>. It has (to keep it simple) a

caf&eacute; life. There's nothing odd about the French custom whereby you pay

more if you want to sit down with your coffee than if you drink it standing up

at the counter. A caf&eacute; is among other things a club.<p>



We have very little of all that. But maybe our republic, too, needs the shelter

of such structures and such ideas, in the icy wind of our sacred marketplace:

"<i>Une societ&eacute; pas de solitude mais de solidarit&eacute;</i>," to quote

Jack Lang.

		O century in recorded history has experienced so many social
transformations and such radical ones as the twentieth century. They, I submit,
may turn out to be the most significant events of this, our century, and its
lasting legacy. In the developed free-market countries--which contain less than
a fifth of the earth's population but are a model for the rest--work and work
force, society and polity, are all, in the last decade of this century,
<i>qualitatively </i>and <i>quantitatively </i>different not only from what
they were in the first years of this century but also from what has existed at
any other time in history: in their configurations, in their processes, in
their problems, and in their structures. <p></font>
		
		
					
	
										

Far smaller and far slower social changes in earlier periods triggered civil
wars, rebellions, and violent intellectual and spiritual crises. The extreme
social transformations of this century have caused hardly any stir. They have
proceeded with a minimum of friction, with a minimum of upheavals, and, indeed,
with a minimum of attention from scholars, politicians, the press, and the
public. To be sure, this century of ours may well have been the cruelest and
most violent in history, with its world and civil wars, its mass tortures,
ethnic cleansings, genocides, and holocausts. But all these killings, all these
horrors inflicted on the human race by this century's murderous "charismatics,"
hindsight clearly shows, were just that: senseless killings, senseless horrors,
"sound and fury, signifying nothing." Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, the three evil
geniuses of this century, destroyed. They created nothing.<p>

Indeed, if this century proves one thing, it is the futility of politics. Even
the most dogmatic believer in historical determinism would have a hard time
explaining the social transformations of this century as caused by the
headline-making political events, or the headline-making political events as
caused by the social transformations. But it is the social transformations,
like ocean currents deep below the hurricane-tormented surface of the sea, that
have had the lasting, indeed the permanent, effect. They, rather than all the
violence of the political surface, have transformed not only the society but
also the economy, the community, and the polity we live in. The age of social
transformation will not come to an end with the year 2000--it will not even
have peaked by then.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC1">THE
SOCIAL STRUCTURE 
</a>
<a name="RTFToC2">TRANSFORMED</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>B</font>EFORE the First World War, farmers composed the largest single group in every
country. They no longer made up the population everywhere, as they had from the
dawn of history to the end of the Napoleonic Wars, a hundred years earlier. But
farmers still made up a near-majority in every developed country except England
and Belgium--in Germany, France, Japan, the United States--and, of course, in
all underdeveloped countries, too. On the eve of the First World War it was
considered a self-evident axiom that developed countries--the United States and
Canada being the only exceptions--would increasingly have to rely on food
imports from nonindustrial, nondeveloped areas.<p>

Today only Japan among major developed free-market countries is a heavy
importer of food. (It is one unnecessarily, for its weakness as a food producer
is largely the result of an obsolete rice-subsidy policy that prevents the
country from developing a modern, productive agriculture.) And in all developed
free-market countries, including Japan, farmers today are at most five percent
of the population and work force--that is, one tenth of the proportion of
eighty years ago. Actually, <i>productive </i>farmers make up less than half of
the total farm population, or no more than two percent of the work force. And
these agricultural producers are not "farmers" in most senses of the word; they
are "agribusiness," which is arguably the most capital-intensive, most
technology-intensive, and most information-intensive industry around.
Traditional farmers are close to extinction even in Japan. And those that
remain have become a protected species kept alive only by enormous subsidies.<p>

The second-largest group in the population and work force of every developed
country around 1900 was composed of live-in servants. They were considered as
much a law of nature as farmers were. Census categories of the time defined a
"lower middle class" household as one that employed fewer than three servants,
and as a percentage of the work force domestics grew steadily up to the First
World War. Eighty years later live-in domestic servants scarcely exist in
developed countries. Few people born since the Second World War--that is, few
people under fifty--have even seen any except on the stage or in old movies.<p>

In the developed society of 2000 farmers are little but objects of nostalgia,
and domestic servants are not even that.<p>

Yet these enormous transformations in all developed free-market countries were
accomplished without civil war and, in fact, in almost total silence. Only now
that their farm population has shrunk to near zero do the totally urban French
loudly assert that theirs should be a "rural country" with a "rural
civilization."<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC3">THE
RISE AND FALL OF THE 
</a><br>
<a name="RTFToC4">BLUE-COLLAR
WORKER
</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>O</font>NE reason why the transformations caused so little stir (indeed, the main
reason) was that by 1900 a new class, the blue-collar worker in manufacturing
industry--Marx's "proletarian"--had become socially dominant. Farmers were
loudly adjured to "raise less corn and more hell," but they paid little
attention. Domestic servants were clearly the most exploited class around. But
when people before the First World War talked or wrote about the "social
question," they meant blue-collar industrial workers. Blue-collar industrial
workers were still a fairly small minority of the population and work
force--right up to 1914 they made up an eighth or a sixth of the total at
most--and were still vastly outnumbered by the traditional lower classes of
farmers and domestic servants. But early-twentieth-century society was obsessed
with blue-collar workers, fixated on them, bewitched by them.<p>

Farmers and domestic servants were everywhere. But as classes, they were
invisible. Domestic servants lived and worked inside individual homes or on
individual farms in small and isolated groups of two or three. Farmers, too,
were dispersed. More important, these traditional lower classes were not
organized. Indeed, they could not be organized. Slaves employed in mining or in
producing goods had revolted frequently in the ancient world--though always
unsuccessfully. But there is no mention in any book I ever read of a single
demonstration or a single protest march by domestic servants in any place, at
any time. There have been peasant revolts galore. But except for two Chinese
revolts in the nineteenth century--the Taiping Rebellion, in midcentury, and
the Boxer Rebellion, at the century's end, both of which lasted for years and
came close to overturning the regime--all peasant rebellions in history have
fizzled out after a few bloody weeks. Peasants, history shows, are very hard to
organize and do not stay organized--which is why they earned Marx's contempt.<p>

The new class, industrial workers, was extremely visible. This is what made
these workers a "class." They lived perforce in dense population clusters and
in cities--in St. Denis, outside Paris; in Berlin's Wedding and Vienna's
Ottakring; in the textile towns of Lancashire; in the steel towns of America's
Monongahela Valley; and in Japan's Kobe. And they soon proved eminently
organizable, with the first strikes occurring almost as soon as there were
factory workers. Charles Dickens's harrowing tale of murderous labor conflict,
<i>Hard Times</i>, was published in 1854, only six years after Marx and Engels
wrote <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>.<p>

By 1900 it had become quite clear that industrial workers would not become the
majority, as Marx had predicted only a few decades earlier. They therefore
would not overwhelm the capitalists by their sheer numbers. Yet the most
influential radical writer of the period before the First World War, the French
ex-Marxist and revolutionary syndicalist Georges Sorel, found widespread
acceptance for his 1906 thesis that the proletarians would overturn the
existing order and take power by their organization and in and through the
violence of the general strike. It was not only Lenin who made Sorel's thesis
the foundation of his revision of Marxism and built around it his strategy in
1917 and 1918. Both Mussolini and Hitler--and Mao, ten years later--built their
strategies on Sorel's thesis. Mao's "power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is
almost a direct quote from Sorel. The industrial worker became the "social
question" of 1900 because he was the first lower class in history that could be
organized and could stay organized.<p>

<font size=5>N</font>O class in history has ever risen faster than the blue-collar worker. And no
class in history has ever fallen faster.<p>
In 1883, the year of Marx's death, "proletarians" were still a minority not
just of the population but also of industrial workers. The majority in industry
were then skilled workers employed in small craft shops, each containing twenty
or thirty workers at most. Of the anti-heroes of the nineteenth century's best
"proletarian" novel, <i>The Princess Casamassima</i>, by Henry James--published
in 1886 (and surely only Henry James could have given such a title to a story
of working-class terrorists!)--one is a highly skilled bookbinder, the other an
equally skilled pharmacist. By 1900 "industrial worker" had become synonymous
with "machine operator" and implied employment in a factory along with hundreds
if not thousands of people. These factory workers were indeed Marx's
proletarians--without social position, without political power, without
economic or purchasing power.<p>

The workers of 1900--and even of 1913--received no pensions, no paid vacation,
no overtime pay, no extra pay for Sunday or night work, no health or old-age
insurance (except in Germany), no unemployment compensation (except, after
1911, in Britain); they had no job security whatever. Fifty years later, in the
1950s, industrial workers had become the largest single group in every
developed country, and unionized industrial workers in mass-production industry
(which was then dominant everywhere) had attained upper-middle-class income
levels. They had extensive job security, pensions, long paid vacations, and
comprehensive unemployment insurance or "lifetime employment." Above all, they
had achieved political power. In Britain the labor unions were considered to be
the "real government," with greater power than the Prime Minister and
Parliament, and much the same was true elsewhere. In the United States, too--as
in Germany, France, and Italy--the labor unions had emerged as the country's
most powerful and best organized <i>political </i>force. And in Japan they had
come close, in the Toyota and Nissan strikes of the late forties and early
fifties, to overturning the system and taking power themselves.<p>

Thirty-five years later, in 1990, industrial workers and their unions were in
retreat. They had become marginal in numbers. Whereas industrial workers who
make or move things had accounted for two fifths of the American work force in
the 1950s, they accounted for less than one fifth in the early 1990s--that is,
for no more than they had accounted for in 1900, when their meteoric rise
began. In the other developed free-market countries the decline was slower at
first, but after 1980 it began to accelerate everywhere. By the year 2000 or
2010, in every developed free-market country, industrial workers will account
for no more than an eighth of the work force. Union power has been declining
just as fast.<p>

Unlike domestic servants, industrial workers will not disappear--any more than
agricultural producers have disappeared or will disappear. But just as the
traditional small farmer has become a recipient of subsidies rather than a
producer, so will the traditional industrial worker become an auxiliary
employee. His place is already being taken by the "technologist"--someone who
works both with hands and with theoretical knowledge. (Examples are computer
technicians, x-ray technicians, physical therapists, medical-lab technicians,
pulmonary technicians, and so on, who together have made up the fastest-growing
group in the U.S. labor force since 1980.) And instead of a class--a coherent,
recognizable, defined, and self-conscious group--industrial workers may soon be
just another "pressure group."<p>

Chroniclers of the rise of the industrial worker tend to highlight the violent
episodes--especially the clashes between strikers and the police, as in
America's Pullman strike. The reason is probably that the theoreticians and
propagandists of socialism, anarchism, and communism--beginning with Marx and
continuing to Herbert Marcuse in the 1960s--incessantly wrote and talked of
"revolution" and "violence." Actually, the rise of the industrial worker was
remarkably <i>nonviolent</i>. The enormous violence of this century--the world
wars, ethnic cleansings, and so on--was all violence from above rather than
violence from below; and it was unconnected with the transformations of
society, whether the dwindling of farmers, the disappearance of domestic
servants, or the rise of the industrial worker. In fact, no one even tries
anymore to explain these great convulsions as part of "the crisis of
capitalism," as was standard Marxist rhetoric only thirty years ago.<p>

Contrary to Marxist and syndicalist predictions, the rise of the industrial
worker did not destabilize society. Instead it has emerged as the century's
most stabilizing social development. It explains why the disappearance of the
farmer and the domestic servant produced no social crises. Both the flight from
the land and the flight from domestic service were voluntary. Farmers and maids
were not "pushed off" or "displaced." They went into industrial employment as
fast as they could. Industrial jobs required no skills they did not already
possess, and no additional knowledge. In fact, farmers on the whole had a good
deal more skill than was required to be a machine operator in a mass-production
plant--and so did many domestic servants. To be sure, industrial work paid
poorly until the First World War. But it paid better than farming or household
work. Industrial workers in the United States until 1913--and in some
countries, including Japan, until the Second World War--worked long hours. But
they worked shorter hours than farmers and domestic servants. What's more, they
worked <i>specified </i>hours: the rest of the day was their own, which was
true neither of work on the farm nor of domestic work.<p>

The history books record the squalor of early industry, the poverty of the
industrial workers, and their exploitation. Workers did indeed live in squalor
and poverty, and they were exploited. But they lived better than those on a
farm or in a household, and were generally treated better.<p>

Proof of this is that infant mortality dropped immediately when farmers and
domestic servants moved into industrial work. Historically, cities had never
reproduced themselves. They had depended for their perpetuation on constant new
recruits from the countryside. This was still true in the mid-nineteenth
century. But with the spread of factory employment the city became the center
of population growth. In part this was a result of new public-health measures:
purification of water, collection and treatment of wastes, quarantine against
epidemics, inoculation against disease. These measures--and they were effective
mostly in the city--counteracted, or at least contained, the hazards of
crowding that had made the traditional city a breeding ground for pestilence.
But the largest single factor in the exponential drop in infant mortality as
industrialization spread was surely the improvement in living conditions
brought about by the factory. Housing and nutrition became better, and hard
work and accidents came to take less of a toll. The drop in infant
mortality--and with it the explosive growth in population--correlates with only
one development: industrialization. The early factory was indeed the "Satanic
Mill" of William Blake's great poem. But the countryside was not "England's
green and pleasant Land" of which Blake sang; it was a picturesque but even
more satanic slum.<p>

For farmers and domestic servants, industrial work was an opportunity. It was,
in fact, the first opportunity that social history had given them to better
themselves substantially without having to emigrate. In the developed
free-market countries over the past 100 or 150 years every generation has been
able to expect to do substantially better than the generation preceding it. The
main reason has been that farmers and domestic servants could and did become
industrial workers.<p>

Because industrial workers are concentrated in groups, systematic work on their
productivity was possible. Beginning in 1881, two years before Marx's death,
the systematic study of work, tasks, and tools raised the productivity of
manual work in making and moving things by three to four percent compound on
average per year--for a fiftyfold increase in output per worker over 110 years.
On this rest all the economic and social gains of the past century. And
contrary to what "everybody knew" in the nineteenth century--not only Marx but
all the conservatives as well, such as J. P. Morgan, Bismarck, and
Disraeli--practically all these gains have accrued to the industrial worker,
half of them in the form of sharply reduced working hours (with the cuts
ranging from 40 percent in Japan to 50 percent in Germany), and half of them in
the form of a twenty-five-fold increase in the real wages of industrial workers
who make or move things.<p>

There were thus very good reasons why the rise of the industrial worker was
peaceful rather than violent, let alone revolutionary. But what explains the
fact that the fall of the industrial worker has been equally peaceful and
almost entirely free of social protest, of upheaval, of serious dislocation, at
least in the United States?<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC5">THE
RISE OF THE 
</a><br>
<a name="RTFToC6">KNOWLEDGE
WORKER
</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>T</font>HE rise of the class succeeding industrial workers is not an opportunity for
industrial workers. It is a challenge. The newly emerging dominant group is
"knowledge workers." The very term was unknown forty years ago. (I coined it in
a 1959 book, <i>Landmarks of Tomorrow</i>.) By the end of this century
knowledge workers will make up a third or more of the work force in the United
States--as large a proportion as manufacturing workers ever made up, except in
wartime. The majority of them will be paid at least as well as, or better than,
manufacturing workers ever were. And the new jobs offer much greater
opportunities.<p>

But--and this is a big but--the great majority of the new jobs require
qualifications the industrial worker does not possess and is poorly equipped to
acquire. They require a good deal of formal education and the ability to
acquire and to apply theoretical and analytical knowledge. They require a
different approach to work and a different mind-set. Above all, they require a
habit of continuous learning. Displaced industrial workers thus cannot simply
move into knowledge work or services the way displaced farmers and domestic
workers moved into industrial work. At the very least they have to change their
basic attitudes, values, and beliefs.<p>

In the closing decades of this century the industrial work force has shrunk
faster and further in the United States than in any other developed
country--while industrial production has grown faster than in any other
developed country except Japan.<p>

The shift has aggravated America's oldest and least tractable problem: the
position of blacks. In the fifty years since the Second World War the economic
position of African-Americans in America has improved faster than that of any
other group in American social history--or in the social history of any
country. Three fifths of America's blacks rose into middle-class incomes;
before the Second World War the figure was one twentieth. But half that group
rose into middle-class <i>incomes </i>and not into middle-class <i>jobs</i>.
Since the Second World War more and more blacks have moved into blue-collar
unionized mass-production industry--that is, into jobs paying middle-class and
upper-middle-class wages while requiring neither education nor skill. These are
precisely the jobs, however, that are disappearing the fastest. What is amazing
is not that so many blacks did not acquire an education but that so many did.
The economically rational thing for a young black in postwar America was not to
stay in school and learn; it was to leave school as early as possible and get
one of the plentiful mass-production jobs. As a result, the fall of the
industrial worker has hit America's blacks disproportionately
hard--quantitatively, but qualitatively even more. It has blunted what was the
most potent role model in the black community in America: the well-paid
industrial worker with job security, health insurance, and a guaranteed
retirement pension--yet possessing neither skill nor much education.<p>

But, of course, blacks are a minority of the population and work force in the
United States. For the overwhelming majority--whites, but also Latinos and
Asians--the fall of the industrial worker has caused amazingly little
disruption and nothing that could be called an upheaval. Even in communities
that were once totally dependent on mass-production plants that have gone out
of business or have drastically slashed employment (steel cities in western
Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio, for instance, or automobile cities like Detroit
and Flint, Michigan), unemployment rates for nonblack adults fell within a few
short years to levels barely higher than the U.S. average--and that means to
levels barely higher than the U.S. "full-employment" rate. Even in these
communities there has been no radicalization of America's blue-collar
workers.<p>

The only explanation is that for the nonblack blue-collar community the
development came as no surprise, however unwelcome, painful, and threatening it
may have been to individual workers and their families. Psychologically--but in
terms of values, perhaps, rather than in terms of emotions--America's
industrial workers must have been prepared to accept as right and proper the
shift to jobs that require formal education and that pay for knowledge rather
than for manual work, whether skilled or unskilled.<p>

In the United States the shift had by 1990 or so largely been accomplished. But
so far it has occurred only in the United States. In the other developed
free-market countries, in western and northern Europe and in Japan, it is just
beginning in the 1990s. It is, however, certain to proceed rapidly in these
countries from now on, perhaps faster than it originally did in the United
States. The fall of the industrial worker in the developed free-market
countries will also have a major impact outside the developed world. Developing
countries can no longer expect to base their development on their comparative
labor advantage--that is, on cheap industrial labor.<p>

It is widely believed, especially by labor-union officials, that the fall of
the blue-collar industrial worker in the developed countries was largely, if
not entirely, caused by moving production "offshore" to countries with abundant
supplies of unskilled labor and low wage rates. But this is not true.<p>

There <i>was </i>something to the belief thirty years ago. Japan, Taiwan, and,
later, South Korea did indeed (as explained in some detail in my 1993 book
<i>Post-Capitalist Society</i>) gain their initial advantage in the world
market by combining, almost overnight, America's invention of training for full
productivity with wage costs that were still those of a pre-industrial country.
But this technique has not worked at all since 1970 or 1975.<p>

In the 1990s only an insignificant percentage of manufactured goods imported
into the United States are produced abroad because of low labor costs. While
total imports in 1990 accounted for about 12 percent of the U.S. gross personal
income, imports from countries with significantly lower wage costs accounted
for less than three percent--and only half of those were imports of
<i>manufactured </i>products. Practically none of the decline in American
manufacturing employment from some 30 or 35 percent of the work force to 15 or
18 percent can therefore be attributed to moving work to low-wage countries.
The main<i> </i>competition for American manufacturing industry--for instance,
in automobiles, in steel, and in machine tools--has come from countries such as
Japan and Germany, where wage costs have long been equal to, if not higher
than, those in the United States. The comparative advantage that now counts is
in the application of knowledge--for example, in Japan's total quality
management, lean manufacturing processes, just-in-time delivery, and
price-based costing, or in the customer service offered by medium-sized German
or Swiss engineering companies. This means, however, that developing countries
can no longer expect to base their development on low wages. They, too, must
learn to base it on applying knowledge--just at the time when most of them
(China, India, and much of Latin America, let alone black Africa) will have to
find jobs for millions of uneducated and unskilled young people who are
qualified for little except yesterday's blue-collar industrial jobs.<p>

But for the developed countries, too, the shift to knowledge-based work poses
enormous social challenges. Despite the factory, industrial society was still
essentially a traditional society in its basic social relationships of
production. But the emerging society, the one based on knowledge and knowledge
workers, is not. It is the first society in which ordinary people--and that
means most people--do not earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brow. It
is the first society in which "honest work" does not mean a callused hand. It
is also the first society in which not everybody does the same work, as was the
case when the huge majority were farmers or, as seemed likely only forty or
thirty years ago, were going to be machine operators.<p>

This is far more than a social change. It is a change in the human condition.
What it means--what are the values, the commitments, the problems, of the new
society--we do not know. But we do know that much will be different.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC7">THE
EMERGING KNOWLEDGE 
</a>
<a name="RTFToC8">SOCIETY</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>K</font>NOWLEDGE workers will not be the majority in the knowledge society, but in
many if not most developed societies they will be the largest single population
and work-force group. And even where outnumbered by other groups, knowledge
workers will give the emerging knowledge society its character, its leadership,
its social profile. They may not be the ruling class of the knowledge society,
but they are already its leading class. And in their characteristics, social
position, values, and expectations, they differ fundamentally from any group in
history that has ever occupied the leading position.<p>

In the first place, knowledge workers gain access to jobs and social position
through formal education. A great deal of knowledge work requires highly
developed manual skill and involves substantial work with one's hands. An
extreme example is neurosurgery. The neurosurgeon's performance capacity rests
on formal education and theoretical knowledge. An absence of manual skill
disqualifies one for work as a neurosurgeon. But manual skill alone, no matter
how advanced, will never enable anyone to be a neurosurgeon. The education that
is required for neurosurgery and other kinds of knowledge work can be acquired
only through formal schooling. It cannot be acquired through apprenticeship.<p>

Knowledge work varies tremendously in the amount and kind of formal knowledge
required. Some jobs have fairly low requirements, and others require the kind
of knowledge the neurosurgeon possesses. But even if the knowledge itself is
quite primitive, only formal education can provide it.<p>

Education will become the center of the knowledge society, and the school its
key institution. What knowledge must everybody have? What is "quality" in
learning and teaching? These will of necessity become central concerns of the
knowledge society, and central political issues. In fact, the acquisition and
distribution of formal knowledge may come to occupy the place in the politics
of the knowledge society which the acquisition and distribution of property and
income have occupied in our politics over the two or three centuries that we
have come to call the Age of Capitalism.<p>

In the knowledge society, clearly, more and more knowledge, and especially
advanced knowledge, will be acquired well past the age of formal schooling and
increasingly, perhaps, through educational processes that do not center on the
traditional school. But at the same time, the performance of the schools and
the basic values of the schools will be of increasing concern to society as a
whole, rather than being considered professional matters that can safely be
left to "educators."<p>

We can also predict with confidence that we will redefine what it means to be
an educated person. Traditionally, and especially during the past 300 years
(perhaps since 1700 or so, at least in the West, and since about that time in
Japan as well), an educated person was somebody who had a prescribed stock of
formal knowledge. The Germans called this knowledge <i>allgemeine Bildung</i>,
and the English (and, following them, the nineteenth-century Americans) called
it the liberal arts. Increasingly, an educated person will be somebody who has
learned how to learn, and who continues learning, especially by formal
education, throughout his or her lifetime.<p>

There are obvious dangers to this. For instance, society could easily
degenerate into emphasizing formal degrees rather than performance capacity. It
could fall prey to sterile Confucian mandarins--a danger to which the American
university is singularly susceptible. On the other hand, it could overvalue
immediately usable, "practical" knowledge and underrate the importance of
fundamentals, and of wisdom altogether.<p>

A society in which knowledge workers dominate is under threat from a new class
conflict: between the large minority of knowledge workers and the majority of
people, who will make their living traditionally, either by manual work,
whether skilled or unskilled, or by work in services, whether skilled or
unskilled. The productivity of knowledge work--still abysmally low--will become
the economic challenge of the knowledge society. On it will depend the
competitive position of every single country, every single industry, every
single institution within society. The productivity of the nonknowledge,
services worker will become the social challenge of the knowledge society. On
it will depend the ability of the knowledge society to give decent incomes, and
with them dignity and status, to non-knowledge workers.<p>

No society in history has faced these challenges. But equally new are the
opportunities of the knowledge society. In the knowledge society, for the first
time in history, the possibility of leadership will be open to all. Also, the
possibility of acquiring knowledge will no longer depend on obtaining a
prescribed education at a given age. Learning will become the tool of the
individual--available to him or her at any age--if only because so much skill
and knowledge can be acquired by means of the new learning technologies.<p>

Another implication is that how well an individual, an organization, an
industry, a country, does in acquiring and applying knowledge will become the
key competitive factor. The knowledge society will inevitably become far more
competitive than any society we have yet known--for the simple reason that with
knowledge being universally accessible, there will be no excuses for
nonperformance. There will be no "poor" countries. There will only be ignorant
countries. And the same will be true for companies, industries, and
organizations of all kinds. It will be true for individuals, too. In fact,
developed societies have already become infinitely more competitive for
individuals than were the societies of the beginning of this century, let alone
earlier ones.<p>

<font size=5>I</font> HAVE been speaking of knowledge. But a more accurate term is "knowledges,"
because the knowledge of the knowledge society will be fundamentally different
from what was considered knowledge in earlier societies--and, in fact, from
what is still widely considered knowledge. The knowledge of the German
<i>allgemeine Bildung </i>or of the Anglo-American liberal arts had little to
do with one's life's work. It focused on the person and the person's
development, rather than on any application--if, indeed, it did not, like the
nineteenth-century liberal arts, pride itself on having no utility whatever. In
the knowledge society knowledge for the most part exists only in application.
Nothing the x-ray technician needs to know can be applied to market research,
for instance, or to teaching medieval history. The central work force in the
knowledge society will therefore consist of highly specialized people. In fact,
it is a mistake to speak of "generalists." What we will increasingly mean by
that term is people who have learned how to acquire additional specialties
rapidly in order to move from one kind of job to another--for example, from
market research into management, or from nursing into hospital administration.
But "generalists" in the sense in which we used to talk of them are coming to
be seen as dilettantes rather than educated people.<p>

This, too, is new. Historically, workers were generalists. They did whatever
had to be done--on the farm, in the household, in the craftsman's shop. This
was also true of industrial workers. But knowledge workers, whether their
knowledge is primitive or advanced, whether there is a little of it or a great
deal, will by definition be specialized. Applied knowledge is effective only
when it is specialized. Indeed, the more highly specialized, the more effective
it is. This goes for technicians who service computers, x-ray machines, or the
engines of fighter planes. But it applies equally to work that requires the
most advanced knowledge, whether research in genetics or research in
astrophysics or putting on the first performance of a new opera.<p>

Again, the shift from knowledge to knowledges offers tremendous opportunities
to the individual. It makes possible a career as a knowledge worker. But it
also presents a great many new problems and challenges. It demands for the
first time in history that people with knowledge take responsibility for making
themselves understood by people who do not have the same knowledge base.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC9">HOW
KNOWLEDGES WORK
</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>T</font>HAT knowledge in the knowledge society has to be highly specialized to be
productive implies two new requirements: that knowledge workers work in teams,
and that if knowledge workers are not employees, they must at least be
affiliated with an organization.<p>

There is a great deal of talk these days about "teams" and "teamwork." Most of
it starts out with the wrong assumption--namely, that we have never before
worked in teams. Actually people have always worked in teams; very few people
ever could work effectively by themselves. The farmer had to have a wife, and
the farm wife had to have a husband. The two worked as a team. And both worked
as a team with their employees, the hired hands. The craftsman also had to have
a wife, with whom he worked as a team--he took care of the craft work, and she
took care of the customers, the apprentices, and the business altogether. And
both worked as a team with journeymen and apprentices. Much discussion today
assumes that there is only one kind of team. Actually there are quite a few.
But until now the emphasis has been on the individual worker and not on the
team. With knowledge work growing increasingly effective as it is increasingly
specialized, teams become the work unit rather than the individual himself.<p>

The team that is being touted now--I call it the "jazz combo" team--is only one
kind of team. It is actually the most difficult kind of team both to assemble
and to make work effectively, and the kind that requires the longest time to
gain performance capacity. We will have to learn to use different kinds of
teams for different purposes. We will have to learn to understand teams--and
this is something to which, so far, very little attention has been paid. The
understanding of teams, the performance capacities of different kinds of teams,
their strengths and limitations, and the trade-offs between various kinds of
teams will thus become central concerns in the management of people.<p>

Equally important is the second implication of the fact that knowledge workers
are of necessity specialists: the need for them to work as members of an
organization. Only the organization can provide the basic continuity that
knowledge workers need in order to be effective. Only the organization can
convert the specialized knowledge of the knowledge worker into performance.<p>

By itself, specialized knowledge does not yield performance. The surgeon is not
effective unless there is a diagnosis--which, by and large, is not the
surgeon's task and not even within the surgeon's competence. As a loner in his
or her research and writing, the historian can be very effective. But to
educate students, a great many other specialists have to contribute--people
whose specialty may be literature, or mathematics, or other areas of history.
And this requires that the specialist have access to an organization.<p>

This access may be as a consultant, or it may be as a provider of specialized
services. But for the majority of knowledge workers it will be as employees,
full-time or part-time, of an organization, such as a government agency, a
hospital, a university, a business, or a labor union. In the knowledge society
it is not the individual who performs. The individual is a cost center rather
than a performance center. It is the organization that performs.<p>
<pre>

</pre>



<h3>
<a name="RTFToC10">WHAT
IS AN EMPLOYEE?
</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>M</font>OST knowledge workers will spend most if not all of their working lives as
"employees." But the meaning of the term will be different from what it has
been traditionally--and not only in English but in German, Spanish, and
Japanese as well.<p>

Individually, knowledge workers are dependent on the job. They receive a wage
or salary. They have been hired and can be fired. Legally each is an employee.
But collectively they are the capitalists; increasingly, through their pension
funds and other savings, the employees own the means of production. In
traditional economics--and by no means only in Marxist economics--there is a
sharp distinction between the "wage fund," all of which goes into consumption,
and the "capital fund," or that part of the total income stream that is
available for investment. And most social theory of industrial society is
based, one way or another, on the relationship between the two, whether in
conflict or in necessary and beneficial cooperation and balance. In the
knowledge society the two merge. The pension fund is "deferred wages," and as
such is a wage fund. But it is also increasingly the main source of capital for
the knowledge society.<p>

Perhaps more important, in the knowledge society the employees--that is,
knowledge workers--own the tools of production. Marx's great insight was that
the factory worker does not and cannot own the tools of production, and
therefore is "alienated." There was no way, Marx pointed out, for the worker to
own the steam engine and to be able to take it with him when moving from one
job to another. The capitalist had to own the steam engine and to control it.
Increasingly, the true investment in the knowledge society is not in machines
and tools but in the knowledge of the knowledge worker. Without that knowledge
the machines, no matter how advanced and sophisticated, are unproductive.<p>

The market researcher needs a computer. But increasingly this is the
researcher's own personal computer, and it goes along wherever he or she goes.
The true "capital equipment" of market research is the knowledge of markets, of
statistics, and of the application of market research to business strategy,
which is lodged between the researcher's ears and is his or her exclusive and
inalienable property. The surgeon needs the operating room of the hospital and
all its expensive capital equipment. But the surgeon's true capital investment
is twelve or fifteen years of training and the resulting knowledge, which the
surgeon takes from one hospital to the next. Without that knowledge the
hospital's expensive operating rooms are so much waste and scrap.<p>

This is true whether the knowledge worker commands advanced knowledge, like a
surgeon, or simple and fairly elementary knowledge, like a junior accountant.
In either case it is the knowledge investment that determines whether the
employee is productive or not, more than the tools, machines, and capital
furnished by an organization. The industrial worker needed the capitalist
infinitely more than the capitalist needed the industrial worker--the basis for
Marx's assertion that there would always be a surplus of industrial workers, an
"industrial reserve army," that would make sure that wages could not possibly
rise above the subsistence level (probably Marx's most egregious error). In the
knowledge society the most probable assumption for organizations--and certainly
the assumption on which they have to conduct their affairs--is that they need
knowledge workers far more than knowledge workers need them.<p>

There was endless debate in the Middle Ages about the hierarchy of knowledges,
with philosophy claiming to be the "queen." We long ago gave up that fruitless
argument. There is no higher or lower knowledge. When the patient's complaint
is an ingrown toenail, the podiatrist's knowledge, not that of the brain
surgeon, controls--even though the brain surgeon has received many more years
of training and commands a much larger fee. And if an executive is posted to a
foreign country, the knowledge he or she needs, and in a hurry, is fluency in a
foreign language--something every native of that country has mastered by age
three, without any great investment. The knowledge of the knowledge society,
precisely because it is knowledge only when applied in action, derives its rank
and standing from the situation. In other words, what is knowledge in one
situation, such as fluency in Korean for the American executive posted to
Seoul, is only information, and not very relevant information at that, when the
same executive a few years later has to think through his company's market
strategy for Korea. This, too, is new. Knowledges were always seen as fixed
stars, so to speak, each occupying its own position in the universe of
knowledge. In the knowledge society knowledges are tools, and as such are
dependent for their importance and position on the task to be performed.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC11">MANAGEMENT
IN THE 
</a><br>
<a name="RTFToC12">KNOWLEDGE
SOCIETY
</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>O</font>NE additional conclusion: Because the knowledge society perforce has to be a
society of organizations, its central and distinctive organ is management.<p>

When our society began to talk of management, the term meant "business
management"--because large-scale business was the first of the new organizations to become visible. But we have
learned in this past half century that management is the distinctive organ of
all organizations. All of them require management, whether they use the term or
not. All managers do the same things, whatever the purpose of their
organization. All of them have to bring people--each possessing different
knowledge--together for joint performance. All of them have to make human
strengths productive in performance and human weaknesses irrelevant. All of
them have to think through what results are wanted in the organization--and
have then to define objectives. All of them are responsible for thinking
through what I call the theory of the business--that is, the assumptions on
which the organization bases its performance and actions, and the assumptions
that the organization has made in deciding what not to do. All of them must
think through strategies--that is, the means through which the goals of the
organization become performance. All of them have to define the values of the
organization, its system of rewards and punishments, its spirit and its
culture. In all organizations managers need both the knowledge of management as
work and discipline and the knowledge and understanding of the organization
itself--its purposes, its values, its environment and markets, its core
competencies.<p>

Management as a practice is very old. The most successful executive in all
history was surely that Egyptian who, 4,500 years or more ago, first conceived
the pyramid, without any precedent, designed it, and built it, and did so in an
astonishingly short time. That first pyramid still stands. But as a discipline
management is barely fifty years old. It was first dimly perceived around the
time of the First World War. It did not emerge until the Second World War, and
then did so primarily in the United States. Since then it has been the fastest-

growing
new function, and the study of it the fastest-

growing
new discipline. No function in history has emerged as quickly as has management
in the past fifty or sixty years, and surely none has had such worldwide sweep
in such a short period.<p>

Management is still taught in most business schools as a bundle of techniques,
such as budgeting and personnel relations. To be sure, management, like any
other work, has its own tools and its own techniques. But just as the essence
of medicine is not urinalysis (important though that is), the essence of
management is not techniques and procedures. The essence of management is to
make knowledges productive. Management, in other words, is a social function.
And in its practice management is truly a liberal art.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC13">THE
SOCIAL SECTOR
</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>T</font>HE old communities--family, village, parish, and so on--have all but
disappeared in the knowledge society. Their place has largely been taken by the
new unit of social integration, the organization. Where community was fate,
organization is voluntary membership. Where community claimed the entire
person, organization is a means to a person's ends, a tool. For 200 years a hot
debate has been raging, especially in the West: are communities "organic" or
are they simply extensions of the people of which they are made? Nobody would
claim that the new organization is "organic." It is clearly an artifact, a
creation of man, a social technology.<p>

But who, then, does the community tasks? Two hundred years ago whatever social
tasks were being done were done in all societies by a local community. Very few
if any of these tasks are being done by the old communities anymore. Nor would
they be capable of doing them, considering that they no longer have control of
their members or even a firm hold over them. People no longer stay where they
were born, either in terms of geography or in terms of social position and
status. By definition, a knowledge society is a society of mobility. And all
the social functions of the old communities, whether performed well or poorly
(and most were performed very poorly indeed), presupposed that the individual
and the family would stay put. But the essence of a knowledge society is
mobility in terms of where one lives, mobility in terms of what one does,
mobility in terms of one's affiliations. People no longer have roots. People no
longer have a neighborhood that controls what their home is like, what they do,
and, indeed, what their problems are allowed to be. The knowledge society is a
society in which many more people than ever before can be successful. But it is
therefore, by definition, also a society in which many more people than ever
before can fail, or at least come in second. And if only because the
application of knowledge to work has made developed societies so much richer
than any earlier society could even dream of becoming, the failures, whether
poor people or alcoholics, battered women or juvenile delinquents, are seen as
failures of society.<p>

Who, then, takes care of the social tasks in the knowledge society? We cannot
ignore them. But the traditional community is incapable of tackling them.<p>

Two answers have emerged in the past century or so--a majority answer and a
dissenting opinion. Both have proved to be wrong.<p>

The majority answer goes back more than a hundred years, to the 1880s, when
Bismarck's Germany took the first faltering steps toward the welfare state. The
answer: the problems of the social sector can, should, and must be solved by
government. This is still probably the answer that most people accept,
especially in the developed countries of the West--even though most people
probably no longer fully believe it. But it has been totally disproved. Modern
government, especially since the Second World War, has everywhere become a huge
welfare bureaucracy. And the bulk of the budget in every developed country
today is devoted to "entitlements"--to payments for all kinds of social
services. Yet in every developed country society is becoming sicker rather than
healthier, and social problems are multiplying. Government has a big role to
play in social tasks--the role of policymaker, of standard setter, and, to a
substantial extent, of paymaster. But as the agency to <i>run</i> social
services, it has proved almost totally incompetent.<p>

In my <i>The Future of Industrial Man</i> (1942), I formulated a dissenting
opinion. I argued then that the new organization--and fifty years ago that
meant the large business enterprise--would have to be the community in which
the individual would find status and function, with the workplace community
becoming the one in and through which social tasks would be organized. In Japan
(though quite independently and without any debt to me) the large
employer--government agency or business--has indeed increasingly attempted to
serve as a community for its employees. Lifetime employment is only one
affirmation of this. Company housing, company health plans, company vacations,
and so on all emphasize for the Japanese employee that the employer, and
especially the big corporation, is the community and the successor to
yesterday's village--even to yesterday's family. This, however, has not worked
either.<p>

There is need, especially in the West, to bring the employee increasingly into
the government of the workplace community. What is now called empowerment is
very similar to the things I talked about fifty years ago. But it does not
create a community. Nor does it create the structure through which the social
tasks of the knowledge society can be tackled. In fact, practically all these
tasks--whether education or health care; the anomies and diseases of a
developed and, especially, a rich society, such as alcohol and drug abuse; or
the problems of incompetence and irresponsibility such as those of the
underclass in the American city--lie outside the employing institution.<p>

The right answer to the question Who takes care of the social challenges of the
knowledge society? is neither the government nor the employing organization.
The answer is a separate and new <i>social sector</i>.<p>

It is less than fifty years, I believe, since we first talked in the United
States of the two sectors of a modern society--the "public sector" (government)
and the "private sector" (business). In the past twenty years the United States
has begun to talk of a third sector, the "nonprofit sector"--those
organizations that increasingly take care of the social challenges of a modern
society.<p>

In the United States, with its tradition of independent and competitive
churches, such a sector has always existed. Even now churches are the largest
single part of the social sector in the United States, receiving almost half
the money given to charitable institutions, and about a third of the time
volunteered by individuals. But the nonchurch part of the social sector has
been the growth sector in the United States. In the early 1990s about a million
organizations were registered in the United States as nonprofit or charitable
organizations doing social-

sector
work. The overwhelming majority of these, some 70 percent, have come into
existence in the past thirty years. And most are community services concerned
with life on this earth rather than with the Kingdom of Heaven. Quite a few of
the new organizations are, of course, religious in their orientation, but for
the most part these are not churches. They are "parachurches" engaged in a
specific social task, such as the rehabilitation of alcohol and drug addicts,
the rehabilitation of criminals, or elementary school education. Even within
the church segment of the social sector the organizations that have shown the
capacity to grow are radically new. They are the "pastoral" churches, which
focus on the spiritual needs of individuals, especially educated knowledge
workers, and then put the spiritual energies of their members to work on the
social challenges and social problems of the community--especially, of course,
the urban community.<p>

We still talk of these organizations as "nonprofits." But this is a legal term.
It means nothing except that under American law these organizations do not pay
taxes. Whether they are organized as nonprofit or not is actually irrelevant to
their function and behavior. Many American hospitals since 1960 or 1970 have
become "for-

profits"
and are organized in what legally are business corporations. They function in
exactly the same way as traditional "nonprofit" hospitals. What matters is not
the legal basis but that the social-

sector
institutions have a particular kind of purpose. Government demands compliance;
it makes rules and enforces them. Business expects to be paid; it supplies.
Social-

sector
institutions aim at changing the human being. The "product" of a school is the
student who has learned something. The "product" of a hospital is a cured
patient. The "product" of a church is a churchgoer whose life is being changed.
The task of social-sector organizations is to create human health and
well-being.<p>

Increasingly these organizations of the social sector serve a second and
equally important purpose. They create citizenship. Modern society and modern
polity have become so big and complex that citizenship--that is, responsible
participation--is no longer possible. All we can do as citizens is to vote once
every few years and to pay taxes all the time.<p>

As a volunteer in a social-

sector
institution, the individual can again make a difference. In the United States,
where there is a long volunteer tradition because of the old independence of
the churches, almost every other adult in the 1990s is working at least
three--and often five--hours a week as a volunteer in a social-

sector
organization. Britain is the only other country with something like this
tradition, although it exists there to a much lesser extent (in part because
the British welfare state is far more embracing, but in much larger part
because it has an established church--paid for by the state and run as a civil
service). Outside the English-speaking countries there is not much of a
volunteer tradition. In fact, the modern state in Europe and Japan has been
openly hostile to anything that smacks of volunteerism--most so in France and
Japan. It is <i>ancien regime</i> and suspected of being fundamentally
subversive.<p>

But even in these countries things are changing, because the knowledge society
needs the social sector, and the social sector needs the volunteer. But
knowledge workers also need a sphere in which they can act as citizens and
create a community. The workplace does not give it to them. Nothing has been
disproved faster than the concept of the "organization man," which was widely
accepted forty years ago. In fact, the more satisfying one's knowledge work is,
the more one needs a separate sphere of community activity.<p>

Many social-

sector
organizations will become partners with government--as is the case in a great
many "privatizations," where, for instance, a city pays for street cleaning and
an outside contractor does the work. In American education over the next twenty
years there will be more and more government-

paid
vouchers that will enable parents to put their children into a variety of
different schools, some public and tax-

supported,
some private and largely dependent on the income from the vouchers. These social-

sector
organizations, although partners with government, also clearly compete with
government. The relationship between the two has yet to be worked out--and
there is practically no precedent for it.<p>

What constitutes performance for social-

sector
organizations, and especially for those that, being nonprofit and charitable,
do not have the discipline of a financial bottom line, has also yet to be
worked out. We know that social-

sector
organizations need management. But what precisely management means for the
social-

sector
organization is just beginning to be studied. With respect to the management of
the nonprofit organization we are in many ways pretty much where we were fifty
or sixty years ago with respect to the management of the business
enterprise:the work is only beginning.<p>

But one thing is already clear. The knowledge society has to be a society of
three sectors: a public sector of government, a private sector of business, and
a social sector. And I submit that it is becoming increasingly clear that
through the social sector a modern developed society can again create
responsible and achieving citizenship, and can again give
individuals--especially knowledge workers--a sphere in which they can make a
difference in society and re-create community.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC14">THE
SCHOOL AS 
</a>
<a name="RTFToC15">SOCIETY'S
CENTER
</a></h3><p>

<font size=5>K</font>NOWLEDGE has become the key resource, for a nation's military strength as well
as for its economic strength. And this knowledge can be acquired only through
schooling. It is not tied to any country. It is portable. It can be created
everywhere, fast and cheaply. Finally, it is by definition changing. Knowledge
as the key resource is fundamentally different from the traditional key
resources of the economist--land, labor, and even capital.<p>

That knowledge has become the key resource means that there is a world economy,
and that the world economy, rather than the national economy, is in control.
Every country, every industry, and every business will be in an increasingly
competitive environment. Every country, every industry, and every business
will, in its decisions, have to consider its competitive standing in the world
economy and the competitiveness of its knowledge competencies.<p>

Politics and policies still center on domestic issues in every country. Few if
any politicians, journalists, or civil servants look beyond the boundaries of
their own country when a new measure such as taxes, the regulation of business,
or social spending is being discussed. Even in Germany--Europe's most export-

conscious
and export-

dependent
major country--this is true. Almost no one in the West asked in 1990 what the
government's unbridled spending in the East would do to Germany's
competitiveness.<p>

This will no longer do. Every country and every industry will have to learn
that the first question is not Is this measure desirable? but What will be the
impact on the country's, or the industry's, competitive position in the world
economy? We need to develop in politics something similar to the environmental-

impact
statement, which in the United States is now required for any government action
affecting the quality of the environment: we need a competitive-

impact
statement. The impact on one's competitive position in the world economy should
not necessarily be the main factor in a decision. But to make a decision
without considering it has become irresponsible.<p>

Altogether, the fact that knowledge has become the key resource means that the
standing of a country in the world economy will increasingly determine its
domestic prosperity. Since 1950 a country's ability to improve its position in
the world economy has been the main and perhaps the sole determinant of
performance in the domestic economy. Monetary and fiscal policies have been
practically irrelevant, for better and, very largely, even for worse (with the
single exception of governmental policies creating inflation, which very
rapidly undermines both a country's competitive standing in the world economy
and its domestic stability and ability to grow).<p>

The primacy of foreign affairs is an old political precept going back in
European politics to the seventeenth century. Since the Second World War it has
also been accepted in American politics--though only grudgingly so, and only in
emergencies. It has always meant that military security was to be given
priority over domestic policies, and in all likelihood this is what it will
continue to mean, Cold War or no Cold War. But the primacy of foreign affairs
is now acquiring a different dimension. This is that a country's competitive
position in the world economy--and also an industry's and an
organization's--has to be the first consideration in its domestic policies and
strategies. This holds true for a country that is only marginally involved in
the world economy (should there still be such a one), and for a business that
is only marginally involved in the world economy, and for a university that
sees itself as totally domestic. Knowledge knows no boundaries. There is no
domestic knowledge and no international knowledge. There is only knowledge. And
with knowledge becoming the key resource, there is only a world economy, even
though the individual organization in its daily activities operates within a
national, regional, or even local setting.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC16">HOW
CAN GOVERNMENT 
</a>
<a name="RTFToC17">FUNCTION?</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>S</font>OCIAL tasks are increasingly being done by individual organizations, each
created for one, and only one, social task, whether education, health care, or
street cleaning. Society, therefore, is rapidly becoming pluralist. Yet our
social and political theories still assume that there are no power centers
except government. To destroy or at least to render impotent all other power
centers was, in fact, the thrust of Western history and Western politics for
500 years, from the fourteenth century on. This drive culminated in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when, except in the United States, such
early institutions as still survived--for example, the universities and the
churches--became organs of the state, with their functionaries becoming civil
servants. But then, beginning in the mid-

nineteenth
century, new centers arose--the first one, the modern business enterprise,
around 1870. And since then one new organization after another has come into
being.<p>

The new institutions--the labor union, the modern hospital, the mega-church,
the research university--of the society of organizations have no interest in
public power. They do not want to be governments. But they demand--and, indeed,
need--autonomy with respect to their functions. Even at the extreme of
Stalinism the managers of major industrial enterprises were largely masters
within their enterprises, and the individual industry was largely autonomous.
So were the university, the research lab, and the military.<p>

In the "pluralism" of yesterday--in societies in which control was shared by
various institutions, such as feudal Europe in the Middle Ages and Edo Japan in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries--pluralist organizations tried to be
in control of whatever went on in their community. At least, they tried to
prevent any other organization from having control of any community concern or
community institution within their domain. But in the society of organizations
each of the new institutions is concerned only with its own purpose and
mission. It does not claim power over anything else. But it also does not
assume responsibility for anything else. Who, then, is concerned with the
common good?<p>

This has always been a central problem of pluralism. No earlier pluralism
solved it. The problem remains, but in a new guise. So far it has been seen as
imposing limits on social institutions--forbidding them to do things in the
pursuit of their mission, function, and interest which encroach upon the public
domain or violate public policy. The laws against discrimination--by race, sex,
age, educational level, health status, and so on--which have proliferated in
the United States in the past forty years all forbid socially undesirable
behavior. But we are increasingly raising the question of the social
responsibility of social institutions: What do institutions have to do--in
addition to discharging their own functions--to advance the public good? This,
however, though nobody seems to realize it, is a demand to return to the old
pluralism, the pluralism of feudalism. It is a demand that private hands assume
public power.<p>

This could seriously threaten the functioning of the new organizations, as the
example of the schools in the United States makes abundantly clear. One of the
major reasons for the steady decline in the capacity of the schools to do their
job--that is, to teach children elementary knowledge skills--is surely that
since the 1950s the United States has increasingly made the schools the
carriers of all kinds of social policies: the elimination of racial
discrimination, of discrimination against all other kinds of minorities,
including the handicapped, and so on. Whether we have actually made any
progress in assuaging social ills is highly debatable; so far the schools have
not proved particularly effective as tools for social reform. But making the
school the organ of social policies has, without any doubt, severely impaired
its capacity to do its own job.<p>

The new pluralism has a new problem: how to maintain the performance capacity
of the new institutions and yet maintain the cohesion of society. This makes
doubly important the emergence of a strong and functioning social sector. It is
an additional reason why the social sector will increasingly be crucial to the
performance, if not to the cohesion, of the knowledge society.<p>

<font size=5>O</font>F the new organizations under consideration here, the first to arise, 120
years ago, was the business enterprise. It was only natural, therefore, that
the problem of the emerging society of organizations was first seen as the
relationship of government and business. It was also natural that the new
interests were first seen as economic interests.<p>

The first attempt to come to grips with the politics of the emerging society of
organizations aimed, therefore, at making economic interests serve the
political process. The first to pursue this goal was an American, Mark Hanna,
the restorer of the Republican Party in the 1890s and, in many ways, the
founding father of twentieth-

century
American politics. His definition of politics as a dynamic disequilibrium
between the major economic interests--farmers, business, and labor--remained
the foundation of American politics until the Second World War. In fact,
Franklin D. Roosevelt restored the Democratic Party by reformulating Hanna. And
the basic political position of this philosophy is evident in the title of the
most influential political book written during the New Deal years--<i>Politics:
Who Gets What, When, How</i> (1936), by Harold D. Lasswell.<p>

Mark Hanna in 1896 knew very well that there are plenty of concerns other than
economic concerns. And yet it was obvious to him--as it was to Roosevelt forty
years later--that economic interests had to be used to integrate all the
others. This is still the assumption underlying most analyses of American
politics--and, in fact, of politics in all developed countries. But the
assumption is no longer tenable. Underlying Hanna's formula of economic
interests is the view of land, labor, and capital as the existing resources.
But knowledge, the new resource for economic performance, is not in itself
economic.<p>

It cannot be bought or sold. The fruits of knowledge, such as the income from a
patent, can be bought or sold; the knowledge that went into the patent cannot
be conveyed at any price. No matter how much a suffering person is willing to
pay a neurosurgeon, the neurosurgeon cannot sell to him--and surely cannot
convey to him--the knowledge that is the foundation of the neurosurgeon's
performance and income. The acquisition of knowledge has a cost, as has the
acquisition of anything. But the acquisition of knowledge has no price.<p>

Economic interests can therefore no longer integrate all other concerns and
interests. As soon as knowledge became the key economic resource, the
integration of interests--and with it the integration of the pluralism of a
modern polity--began to be lost. Increasingly, non-economic interests are
becoming the new pluralism--the special interests, the single-

cause
organizations, and so on. Increasingly, politics is not about "who gets what,
when, how" but about values, each of them considered to be an absolute.
Politics is about the right to life of the embryo in the womb as against the
right of a woman to control her own body and to abort an embryo. It is about
the environment. It is about gaining equality for groups alleged to be
oppressed and discriminated against. None of these issues is economic. All are
fundamentally moral.<p>

Economic interests can be compromised, which is the great strength of basing
politics on economic interests. "Half a loaf is still bread" is a meaningful
saying. But half a baby, in the biblical story of the judgment of Solomon, is
not half a child. No compromise is possible. To an environmentalist, half an
endangered species is an extinct species.<p>

This greatly aggravates the crisis of modern government. Newspapers and
commentators still tend to report in economic terms what goes on in Washington,
in London, in Bonn, or in Tokyo. But more and more of the lobbyists who
determine governmental laws and governmental actions are no longer lobbyists
for economic interests. They lobby for and against measures that they--and
their paymasters--see as moral, spiritual, cultural. And each of these new
moral concerns, each represented by a new organization, claims to stand for an
absolute. Dividing their loaf is not compromise; it is treason.<p>

There is thus in the society of organizations no one integrating force that
pulls individual organizations in society and community into coalition. The
traditional parties--perhaps the most successful political creations of the
nineteenth century--can no longer integrate divergent groups and divergent
points of view into a common pursuit of power. Rather, they have become
battlefields between groups, each of them fighting for absolute victory and not
content with anything but total surrender of the enemy.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC18">THE
NEED FOR SOCIAL AND 
</a><br>
<a name="RTFToC19">POLITICAL
INNOVATION
</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>T</font>HE twenty-

first
century will surely be one of continuing social, economic, and political
turmoil and challenge, at least in its early decades. What I have called the
age of social transformation is not over yet. And the challenges looming ahead
may be more serious and more daunting than those posed by the social
transformations that have already come about, the social transformations of the
twentieth century.<p>

Yet we will not even have a chance to resolve these new and looming problems of
tomorrow unless we first address the challenges posed by the developments that
are already accomplished facts, the developments reported in the earlier
sections of this essay. These are the priority tasks. For only if they are
tackled can we in the developed democratic free-

market
countries hope to have the social cohesion, the economic strength, and the
governmental capacity needed to tackle the new challenges. The first order of
business--for sociologists, political scientists, and economists; for
educators; for business executives, politicians, and nonprofit-group leaders;
for people in all walks of life, as parents, as employees, as citizens--is to
work on these priority tasks, for few of which we so far have a precedent, let
alone tested solutions.<p>

<li> We will have to think through <i>education</i>--its purpose, its values, its
content. We will have to learn to define the quality of education and the
productivity of education, to measure both and to manage both.<p>

<li> We need systematic work on the <i>quality of knowledge</i> and the
<i>productivity of knowledge</i>--neither even defined so far. The performance
capacity, if not the survival, of any organization in the knowledge society
will come increasingly to depend on those two factors. But so will the
performance capacity, if not the survival, of any individual in the knowledge
society. And what <i>responsibility</i> does knowledge have? What are the
responsibilities of the knowledge worker, and especially of a person with
highly specialized knowledge?<p>

<li>Increasingly, the <i>policy</i> of any country--and especially of any
developed country--will have to give primacy to the country's competitive
position in an increasingly competitive world economy. Any proposed domestic
policy needs to be shaped so as to improve that position, or at least to
minimize adverse impacts on it. The same holds true for the policies and
strategies of any institution within a nation, whether a local government, a
business, a university, or a hospital.<p>

<li> But then we also need to develop an <i>economic theory</i> appropriate to a
world economy in which knowledge has become the key economic resource and the
dominant, if not the only, source of comparative advantage.<p>

<li> We are beginning to understand the new integrating mechanism:
<i>organization</i>. But we still have to think through how to balance two
apparently contradictory requirements. Organizations must competently perform
the one social function for the sake of which they exist--the school to teach,
the hospital to cure the sick, and the business to produce goods, services, or
the capital to provide for the risks of the future. They can do so only if they
single-

mindedly
concentrate on their specialized mission. But there is also society's need for
these organizations to take social responsibility--to work on the problems and
challenges of the community. Together these organizations <i>are</i> the
community. The emergence of a strong, independent, capable social
sector--neither public sector nor private sector--is thus a central need of the
society of organizations. But by itself it is not enough--the organizations of
both the public and the private sector must share in the work.<p>

<li> The <i>function of government</i> and its <i>functioning</i> must be central
to political thought and political action. The megastate in which this century
indulged has not performed, either in its totalitarian or in its democratic
version. It has not delivered on a single one of its promises. And government
by countervailing lobbyists is neither particularly effective--in fact, it is
paralysis--nor particularly attractive. Yet effective government has never been
needed more than in this highly competitive and fast-

changing
world of ours, in which the dangers created by the pollution of the physical
environment are matched only by the dangers of worldwide armaments pollution.
And we do not have even the beginnings of political theory or the political
institutions needed for effective government in the knowledge-

based
society of organizations.<p>

If the twentieth century was one of social transformations, the twenty-

first
century needs to be one of social and political innovations, whose nature
cannot be so clear to us now as their necessity.

<blockquote>





<font size=5>O</font><font size=3>nly when nature has been

conquered can it be enjoyed. For most of human history the mountains, the

ocean, the frontier, were dangerous and terrifying places. One didn't trifle

with them. Sitting with my children on a beach in Cornwall last summer, I

wondered whether generations of Cornish sailors and fishermen who had wrested a

grueling livelihood from the sea and all too often perished at its hands would

have believed me if I had told them that the little boats dotting the horizon

were being sailed for pleasure. As for those folk closer inshore who were

apparently trying to ride the tops of the breaking waves on little planks, the

old mariners of Padstow and Port Isaac would surely have thought them votaries

of a bizarre cult, or else deranged.<p>



Similar thoughts had crossed my mind a few months earlier. I was dressed in

strange, shiny, bright clothes, my feet were tied to narrow slats, and I was

standing at nearly 12,000 feet above sea level, in the shadow of the most

famously recognizable of mountains, whose peak seems to lean at a crooked angle

like the spire of Chesterfield church. What would those who had for centuries

past dwelt under the Matterhorn have thought of me and the casual insolence

with which I was treating their mountain range? Could they have believed that I

was there to enjoy myself, by gliding down to Zermatt across the snows that had

always been the local people's deadliest enemy? For most of history these Alps

had been as awesome as the ocean, a place where human beings went in fear of

the destructive power of nature. They were among the most sparsely populated

and least visited wildernesses of Europe.<p>



	<img src="./alps.gif" align=right width=200 height=133>



Then came the English. My countrymen have a lot to answer for--or, at any rate,

a curious catalogue of achievements to their name: along with this language and

team games, winter sports are among the legacies that will survive England when

the country itself is forgotten. The English discovered nature, and at the same

time they invented tourism: the word "tourist"entered the language to describe

those who were visiting <A HREF="http://www.wwwebguides.com/britain/cumbria/lakes/lakes.html">the Lake District of northwestern England</A> 200 years

ago, just at the time when Wordsworth was there <A HREF="http://library.utoronto.ca/www/utel/rp/poems/wordswor27.html">wandering lonely as a cloud</A>.<p>

From Cumbrian fells we moved on to majestic Alps, admired from afar by Byron

and Shelley. And then, toward the end of the nineteenth century, we found (how

very English of us) ways of revering nature while exercising our muscles. The

first was alpinism, or mountain climbing. Zermatt became its cathedral, the

Matterhorn its high altar--and the overtones of sacrifice are all too accurate.

In 1865 Edward Whymper, of London, still commemorated by a Whymper Room in the

charming Monte Rosa hotel in Zermatt, became the first man to climb the

Matterhorn. Four of his companions fell to their deaths--the first four

climbers of many. One of the bleaker spots in Zermatt is the large corner of

the cemetery that is filled with the gravestones of young men--most of them

English, though there are Americans also--who died trying to conquer that

magnificent but daunting peak.<p>

To this day Zermatt has more visitors in summer than in winter. But just as

Whymper was climbing, another sport was being born in Norway: cross-country

racing on the wooden skis that had been used for centuries in Scandinavia.

Englishmen are said to have brought skiing to Europe's greatest mountain range,

and gradually developed in the Alps the previously unknown art of <A HREF="http://diwww.epfl.ch/~jcoates/Ski_HomePage.html">downhill

skiing</A>. Those pioneers couldn't have guessed that this was to become one of the

most popular recreations--and one of the great worldwide multibillion-dollar

leisure industries--of the twentieth century.<p>

The essential technical development that made this industry possible wasn't the

skis themselves but the means of getting up a slope before coming down it at

speed. It's painful even to think of the early days, when skiers would spend

exhausting hours climbing up through the snow so as to make one downhill run

lasting several minutes. All of that has been changed by cable cars and lifts.

And so here I stood in the dazzling sun, gazing down on the glorious panorama,

a lucky beneficiary of that once unimaginable conquest of nature.<p>

<font size=5>B</font><font size=3>efore cable cars there were cog-wheel railways. One of the most famous still

runs from Zermatt to Gornergrat. The journey cannot be called fast, but it is

one of my favorite ways of starting the morning: breakfast early, walk down the

main street to buy the <i>Neue Z&uuml;rcher Zeitung</i> and the

<i>International Herald Tribune</i>, and then sit reading them like any other

commuter, first on the cog-wheel train to Gornergrat and then on one of the

cable cars that ascend to Stockhorn. From there you can ski over to the

Blauherd and Unterrothorn lifts and, if you don't want to ski all the way down

at the end of the day, take the fast subway down from Sunnegga.

Zermatt offers a large skiing area east of the Matterhorn and another on the

slopes of the mountain itself, at the southerly head of the valley. A series of

cable cars takes you to the Klein Matterhorn, and then a smaller lift brings

you to the highest lift station in Europe, at 12,795 feet. From here there are

half a dozen possibilities, among them skiing over to Italy for a decent cup of

coffee--the border is a few hundred yards away--or skiing gradually down all

the way to Zermatt, stopping at one of the excellent mountain restaurants for

lunch.<p>

Although Zermatt has grown since Whymper's day, it is in many ways the least

spoiled of all the famous Swiss resorts. It can't spill out beyond its narrow

valley, new buildings have been restricted to the traditional chalet style, the

main street still has a village atmosphere, and fast-food joints are far

outnumbered by simple inns serving simple Swiss food. I was staying at the

Romantica hotel, a friendly, comfortable, inexpensive bed-and-breakfast place

(the phone number is 011-41-28-671505, and the rate is $67.00- $84.00 per

person a night), and I often ate in the evening at the Gitan, a couple of

minutes away--a good plain place with good plain sausages and

<i>r&ouml;sti</i>, that delicious and fiendishly fattening potato dish. For a

rather more elegant evening try Elsie's bar, a couple hundred yards up the

street.<p>

<font size=5>T</font><font size=3>he year before Whymper climbed the Matterhorn, another group (yes, of

Englishmen, I'm afraid) was summering in the Engadine valley, on the other side

of <A HREF="http://heiwww.unige.ch/switzerland/">Switzerland</A>, walking and taking the waters in a little village called St.

Moritz. Someone suggested that these fellows should come back in the winter to

try the local sport of tobogganing. The eventual result was the Cresta

Run--still the world's most famous toboggan and bobsled run--and, in the end,

one of the most famous of all winter-sports resorts. St. Moritz has everything:

skating and curling; horse racing on the frozen lake; langlauf, or Nordic,

skiing; and wonderful <A HREF="http://diwww.epfl.ch/~jcoates/Ski_Pistes_Valais.html">downhill skiing</A>.<p>

There is more than one way of getting from Zermatt to St. Moritz, but there's

no doubt which is the most beautiful. The fancifully named <A HREF="http://www.uni-essen.de/initiative/schweiz/BVZ/daten.en.html#route"><i>Glacier

Express</i></A> is probably among the slower trains of the Swiss railroad (itself a

wonder, running its clean and comfortable trains to all parts of the country in

all weather with almost neurotic punctuality), for it takes around seven hours

to make its 190-mile journey. But what a journey! From Zermatt the line plunges

to Brig. Then it climbs through dramatic and glorious valleys toward Oberwald

and Andermatt, en route to the Oberalp pass--at 6,670 feet, among the highest

railroad lines in Europe. <p>

Andermatt might be worth a break in one's journey. It is a pretty village with

an exquisite baroque church, though one side of town is dominated by bleak

barracks looking up at the bleaker mountains: this is one of the Swiss army's

main centers for training ski troops. And although not much frequented by

visitors from outside the country, it has some of the finest skiing in

<A HREF="http://www.ethz.ch/swiss/Switzerland_Info.html">Switzerland</A>. On my latest trip, though, I pressed on. The train climbed the

last stretch of the line, past Reichenau and Filisur, amid gently falling snow,

a wonderfully romantic sight as well as a welcoming one for skiers.<p>

 

<font size=5>O</font><font size=3>nce the most aristocratic of resorts, St. Moritz has slowly acquired a

reputation as home to that unloved international class known as rich white

trash. It's true that the town has, along with delightful survivals like

Hanselmann's caf&eacute; and Glattfelders, a high fur-and-diamond count. All

the talk last year was of the Russian invasion: not a military one but an

influx of dubious-looking fellows riding in Mercedes, accompanied by

overdressed women, badly dressed heavies, and vast quantities of dollar bills

obtained by who knows what entrepreneurial methods.<p>

For those of us who can't afford the Kulm or the Palace hotel (or the boutiques

bearing names like Giorgio Armani and Herm&egrave;s which surround them), there

are alternatives to the town itself as a place to stay. Celerina, near St.

Moritz, is less oppressively opulent and has its own direct access to the

slopes; as I had found before, it is pleasant enough. But last year I made a

discovery that may change my skiing life: a few miles up the Engadine valley

from St. Moritz, twenty minutes or so from the railroad station by bus, is Sils

Maria, one of the Good Places on earth. It is a charming, quiet, unaffected

village, and a dream come true both for skiers and for intellectual snobs. <p>

Next door to the spacious Edelweiss hotel, where I stayed, is a small old

house. Here Friedrich <A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/dept/annenberg/thomas/bio.html">Nietzsche came to stay in 1881</A>, and here he worked on

some of his famous texts: <i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i>, <i>Beyond Good and

Evil</i>, and <i>The Case of Wagner</i>. If the English tobogganers set one

fashion, Nietzsche set another: subsequent literary visitors to the upper

Engadine valley have included Proust, Rilke, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Paul

Celan, Pablo Neruda, Karl Kraus, Jean Cocteau, and Boris Pasternak--a list that

would be hard to rival anywhere else.<p>

They weren't all in the Engadine for winter sport, and Nietzsche would be

startled by his beloved valley today. On one side of the valley are the scores

of runs down from Piz Nair, looming high above St. Moritz to the west; on the

other is Corvatsch, dominating the valley above Sils Maria. The great joy of

Sils is that you can take cable cars directly up to Furtschellas, ski over to

Corvatsch and then right down toward St. Moritz-Bad, walk (or, with a bit of

luck, langlauf) across to the big Signal cable, and ascend to the Corviglia

slopes, almost without removing your skis. <p>

You can, in other words, enjoy all the skiing the upper Engadine has to offer

without, if you choose, setting foot in St. Moritz itself. You can stay at the

Edelweiss (011-41-82-45551; unfortunately, this hotel is not a good example of

how affordable Sils Maria can be: rooms for two run about <A HREF="http://www.dna.lth.se/cgi-bin/kurt/rates">$320</A> and up in high

season, though this price does include breakfast and dinner), or at one of the

simpler places in Sils, including apartments with kitchens. (For information on

the full range of accommodations in this area and elsewhere, call Switzerland

Tourism at 212-757-5944.) There are a few little restaurants, among them the

delightful Marchetta. When I say that the nightlife of Sils Maria is almost

nonexistent, I mean that as the warmest possible commendation. <p>

Both Zermatt and St. Moritz offer skiing for most ages and abilities, though

they are not ideal for absolute beginners. They have incomparable scenery, and

plenty to do when you aren't wearing skis. It would be absurd to pretend that

Switzerland is a cheap country to visit. And yet I will say this: If you love

good food and wine, then at least once in your life you must visit France. If

you love golf, then some time or other you must play in Scotland. And if

downhill skiing is your sport, then you must try the place it sprang from.

Switzerland can be afforded on a modest budget, with careful planning. And no

one who has fallen under the spell of skiing, this exhilarating way of wasting

time amid the glories of tamed nature, can, in another sense, afford not to try

it once on the slopes of the Matterhorn and Corvatsch.

<blockquote>
										<!--INITIAL DROPCAP-->
	
	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/W-small.gif" 
	align=left height=44></font>HEN an associate asked Thomas Alva Edison about the secret to his talent for
invention, the plainspoken Edison retorted, "Genius is hard work,
stick-to-itiveness, and common sense."<p>

"There's still more!" his colleague said imploringly. "Although [the rest of
us] know quite a lot . . . and worked hard, we couldn't invent . . . as you
did."<p>
		
		
	
	What Edison never seemed to grasp was that his "common sense" was exceedingly
uncommon--freakish, really. More patents were issued to him than have been
issued to any other single person in U.S. history: 1,093. But Edison's towering
status reflects more than his extraordinary productivity. He created things
that transformed our world--among them the phonograph, <A HREF="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/papr/mpixhome.html">the motion-picture
camera</A>, and the incandescent light bulb. And he made substantial contributions
to numerous technologies, including telegraphy, telephone communications, and
several business procedures.<p>

Yet, in the six decades since the inventor's death, little serious writing has
been done about Edison's remarkable genius for <A HREF="http://hawaii.cogsci.uiuc.edu/invent/invention.html">invention</A>. In the words of the
historian Keith Nier, "He is actually one of the least well known of all famous
people, and much of what everybody thinks they know about him is no more
reliable than a fairy tale."<p>

Nier is one of eight historians at Rutgers University and at the Edison
National Historic Site, in West Orange, New Jersey, who are now trying to set
the record straight. The team, headed by Robert Rosenberg, is in the process of
editing and publishing selected documents from the inventor's life's work. The
scale of their endeavor is virtually unprecedented in the history of technology
and science. What is now known as the Edison Papers Project started in 1978,
when archivists estimated that the inventor's estate included just over a
million pages of documents. Having been told that the contents had been
"loosely organized" by previous archivists, the Edison Papers staff expected to
have chosen the documents for a highly selective microfilm edition within a
decade, after which a still more selective book edition would be completed.<p>

			<img src="./lab.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="">


Alas, organization, like beauty, turns out to be in the eye of the beholder.
"It was a big mess," recalls the associate director of the project, Thomas
Jeffrey, remembering his dismay at seeing for the first time the documents
housed at the extensive industrial complex that makes up the Edison National
Historic Site. Dusty stacks of papers--many seemingly untouched since Edison's
death--sprouted as haphazardly as weeds across the space. Jeffrey, who had
been hired to make the initial selection for the microfilm edition, instead
found himself leading a scouting expedition. "We went from building to
building, room to room, drawer to drawer," he recalls. "It took us more than a
year just to get to the end of the paper trail, and when we added up the
numbers in our inventory, we were shocked."<p>

The collection turned out to include at least four million pages, and quite
possibly as many as five million. According to Jeffrey's most recent estimate,
publishing a representative sample of the inventor's work in both a microfilm
edition and a printed edition of fifteen to twenty volumes could take until
2015. (To date the team has published more than 250,000 pages of documents on
microfilm and three enormous printed volumes, and has begun preparing for
electronic publication.)<p>

Now, seventeen years into the project, the historians have become so intimately
acquainted with their subject that, as Rosenberg half guiltily admits, "we've
become spies inside his mind." All are acutely aware of their unique privilege.
In many instances they are the first people since the inventor's death to gaze
on laboratory records, early drafts of patent applications, letters, photos of
models, and other telling memorabilia.<p>

Luckily for posterity, the process by which Edison invented is documented in
exquisite detail in a series of 3,500 notebooks. The researchers unabashedly
compare his fecundity of ideas to Leonardo da Vinci's. The notebooks are filled
with fascinating observations and insights--many pertaining to unrelated
projects, in a seeming free flow of associations. Consecutive sketches--some
rough and crude, others executed with the exactitude of a draftsman--traverse a
vast spectrum of technologies.<p>

On New Year's Day, 1871, more than three decades before the Wright brothers'
historic flight, Edison speculated that "a Paines engine can be so constructed
of steel &amp; with hollow magnets . . . and combined with suitable air
propelling apparatus wings . . . as to produce a flying machine of extreme lightness and tremendous power." "<U>Discovery</U>," begins an entry dated May
26, 1877. "If you look very closely at any printed matter so that the print is
greatly blurred and you see double images of the type . . . one of the double
images is always blue or ultra violet=" "Glorious= Telephone perfected this
morning 5 AM," he confidently proclaimed in a notebook entry two months later.
"Articulation perfect."<p>

Not all his ideas reached fruition, of course. His flying machine was never
mentioned again. Nor does anything appear to have come of the blue-violet
optical effect that he found so captivating. As for his "perfected" telephone,
it turned out to have numerous flaws that required another nine months to iron
out. <p>

Between inventive flurries Edison's mind seems to have wandered, as evidenced
by pages decorated in half a dozen florid styles of calligraphy. Occasionally
he even jotted down a poem. Here is a notebook sample from the mid-1870s:
<blockquote>A yellow oasis in hell=

premeditated stupidity= A phrenological idol. 

The somber dream of the grey-eyed
Corsican 

A Brain so small that an animalcule went to view it with a compound microscope.
. . .</blockquote>

			alt="" border=0></A>


Edison's genius is all the more remarkable when viewed
against the backdrop of his unexceptional childhood. Born in 1847, he was
raised in Port Huron, Michigan, by parents with no special mechanical bent. His
mother, a former schoolteacher, provided him with a few years of instruction at
home. His father, a jack-of-all-trades who tried his hand at everything from real-estate speculation to running a
small grocery store, was also highly literate and had a collection of books
that young Tom eagerly consumed. In his early teens the youth began reading
science books that described chemistry experiments. He had a job selling
newspapers and candy to passengers on the Grand Trunk Railway between Port
Huron and Detroit, and during breaks from work he tried out some of these
experiments in a baggage car.<p>

Later in his teens he received a more thorough grounding in the rudiments of
what would soon be his trade while hanging around railroad yards, newspaper
offices, and machine shops, and working in a jeweler's shop and various
telegraph offices. On these jobs he was exposed to lathes and various precision
tools, clockwork and printing equipment, and a wide assortment of telegraphy
instruments, which he studied and experimented with during his spare time.<p>

By his early twenties Edison, moonlighting as an inventor, had totted up enough
successes to win lucrative research contracts from Western Union and other
prominent firms, giving him the confidence to strike out on his own. But he
never fit the popular stereotype of the reclusive nineteenth-century
inventor, struggling alone in a garret. From the start collaboration was
critical to his success. Indeed, one of Edison's greatest accomplishments was
the invention of an entirely new institution--the independent industrial-research
laboratory, or what he affectionately called his "invention factory."<p>

At his first large independent laboratory, in Menlo Park, and later at
facilities in West Orange, Edison kept a well-stocked chemistry lab and a
machine shop under one roof--a considerable novelty for that period. He also
surrounded himself with a core group of half a dozen or more assistants. A few
were university-educated men specially chosen because of their expertise in fields in which Edison felt
himself to be deficient (mathematics was one). His intimate working
relationships with the mechanic and experimenter Charles Batchelor, who
assisted him over much of his career; with Francis Upton, a major collaborator
on electric lighting; and with the electrical engineer Arthur Kennelly--to
mention only a few of his closest associates--have long been appreciated by
scholars. But the new research into Edison's papers shows that Edison's talent
for motivating people extended well beyond this elite inner circle--a finding
that may contain an important lesson for the entrepreneurial
research-and-development firms that are the modern-day incarnations of Edison's vision.<p>

Everyone--from his closest lieutenants to the cadre of skilled workers who
operated his facilities--was encouraged to jot down diagrams and ideas.
Particularly good ideas would be initialed by the experimenter in charge of the
project and then developed further by the group, making it impossible to assign
the credit for an invention to any one creator. "One of Edison's greatest
overlooked talents," the historian Greg Field argues, "was his ability to
assemble teams and set up an organizational structure that fostered many
people's creativity."<p>

This is not to imply that Edison's opinion carried no more weight than that of
any other collaborator. A large, burly figure with piercing eyes and a
bristling intolerance for laziness, he was very much the commander leading the
charge for innovation. Typically he would surge forth on his own course of
research, dashing off ideas and conducting experiments seemingly as fast as
they came to mind. Once the groundwork for an invention had been laid, he would
leave the details to others. The frequent notes of assistants duly recorded the
master's advice: "Mr Edison says the temp is to[o] high." "Edison says this is
good brick."<p>

In addition to tapping the creative juices of his staff, Edison was
knowledgeable about the research of competitors. Contrary to public perception,
he almost never worked on any invention that wasn't already being pursued by
several other people. What set him apart from his peers was his knack for
transforming those ideas into practical results.<p>

<a name="RTFToC1">Every
Failure 
</a><br>
<a name="RTFToC2">a
Success
</a></h3>
	<font size=5>T</font><font size=3>HE Edison Papers team has been able to find little evidence to support the
view that inspiration again and again struck Edison like lightning bolts out of
the blue. Take Edison's widely repeated account of a carbon-filament
light bulb that burned forty hours straight as his associates watched,
transfixed by the miracle. That episode, dramatized in a Hollywood film
starring Spencer Tracy as the great inventor, never really happened.
Scrutinizing the notebooks from that period, the scholars discovered that the
bulb burned only fifteen and a half hours. According to Paul Israel, a
historian preparing a biography of Edison based on the archival endeavor, the
team's version of that exciting event became inflated after subsequent tests of
other carbon-filament materials confirmed the general approach. "The whole
'Eureka!' story arose afterward, probably because they needed a date for the
anniversary of the electric light," Israel theorizes. "So they cast their minds
back, and suddenly a fifteen-hour bulb became a forty-hour bulb."<p>

A casual reading of Edison's notebooks leaves one with the impression that
Eureka! moments were frequent in the laboratory. That's because Edison tended
to become wildly enthusiastic about virtually any quirky or unaccountable
phenomenon--from the unexpected deflection of a galvanometer needle during an
electrical experiment to his discovery on his daily walk around the lab grounds
of a bug emitting an unusual odor (this so fascinated the inventor that he
wrote to Charles Darwin about it). Yet the project team can identify only a few
Eureka! moments that actually had valuable results over Edison's long and
illustrious career, and only one--the discovery of the principles behind <A HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~rfrederi/wortho1.htm">the
phonograph</A>--that deserves the mythic importance with which the public invests
such events. <p>

A classic spinoff, the phonograph emerged unbeckoned from work on telegraphs
and telephones. In the interest of efficiency, the American mode of telegraphy
used receiving instruments that produced a series of clicks, which
operators mentally translated into letters. The clicks themselves left no
lasting trace. In 1876 Edison and his associates developed a telegraph recorder
that would emboss a message on paper, so that it could be transmitted
repeatedly at high speed and a receiving operator could rerun it more slowly
for transcription. One July day in 1877 Edison considered using a very similar
technique for recording telephone messages. The next day he realized that he
could dispense with the electrical message, directly emboss the vibrations of
the original sounds, and replay them for a simulacrum of the speaker's voice.
This flash of insight paved the way for the modern recording industry.<p>

Why, given that major inventions seldom emerge as revelations, was Edison so
effective? The Edison Papers Project scholars can point to attitudes, work
habits, and methods of reasoning that clearly contributed to his prolific
output.<p>

In Israel's view, perseverance was a cornerstone of Edison's strength. This
idea is captured in his famous proclamation, "Invention is ninety-nine percent
perspiration, and one percent inspiration." In Victorian-era America, of course, hard work and determination were commonly invoked to
explain the self-made man. But the recent scholarship casts doubt on the inventor's clever but
ultimately facile account of his own genius, addressing such fundamental issues
as what enabled him to push ahead in the face of numerous setbacks and how
exactly he learned from failure.<p>

Edison could not conceive of any experiment as a flop. As Israel puts it, "He
saw every failure as a success, because it channeled his thinking in a more
fruitful direction." Israel thinks that Edison may have learned this attitude
from his enterprising father, who was not afraid to take risks and never became
undone when a business venture crumbled. Sam Edison would simply brush himself
off and embark on a new moneymaking scheme, usually managing to shield the
family from financial hardship. Israel says, "This sent a very positive message
to his son--that it's okay to fail--and may explain why he rarely got discouraged
if an experiment didn't work out." In addition to teaching him what wouldn't
work, Israel says, failed experiments taught him the much more valuable lesson
of what <i>would </i>work--albeit in a different context.<p>

Very few challenges failed to yield to Edison's brute intelligence, but one
that did ultimately defeat him was the undersea telegraph. To help his
experiments, Edison designed a laboratory model of a transatlantic cable, in
which cheap powdered carbon was used to simulate the electrical resistance of
thousands of miles of wires. Alas, the rumble of traffic outdoors, clattering
in the machine shop, or even the scientists' footsteps shook the equipment
enough to change the pressure of the connecting wires on the carbon, thus
altering its resistance. Since the accuracy of the model depended upon constant
resistance in the carbon, Edison finally abandoned this approach. But later,
when confronted with the problem of how to improve the transmission of voices
over the telephone, he used a funnel-shaped mouthpiece to focus sound waves on a carbon button. The pressure of those
vibrations altered the resistance in the circuit in synchrony with the
speaker's voice. In other words, what ruined Edison's underwater-telegraphy
experiments is exactly what made his telephone transmitter such a triumph.
Indeed, this innovative transmitter rendered Alexander Graham Bell's telephone
practical--so much so that it remained the industry standard for a century.<p>

Edison viewed even disasters as an opportunity for learning. On one occasion
his lab stove went out in the dead of winter, causing an assortment of
expensive chemicals to freeze. On another occasion unprotected chemicals were
damaged by sunlight. Instead of bemoaning the losses, Edison put aside all
other projects to catalogue changes in the properties of the bottled
substances. Keith Nier observes, "He knew how to turn lemons into lemonade."<p>

In his memoirs, and certainly before the press, Edison projected the image of a
no-nonsense workaholic. In various respects he lived up to this reputation, often working
as many as 112 hours a week. His second wife, Mina, had a cot set up in a
corner of his library so that he could take catnaps in a more dignified manner
than stretching out on the laboratory bench, as had been his habit. Yet this
hard-driving man also had a childlike sense of curiosity and a fun-loving streak that could not always be contained in his rush to meet deadlines
and achieve goals.<p>

Perhaps the most delightful document yet unearthed by the project editors is
one that captures a giddy moment in the lab during a marathon work spell, when
Edison and his colleagues behaved with the goofy abandon of high school kids
set loose in chemistry class. Searching for a liquid with specific properties
for an electrochemical device, they tried caraway oil, clove oil, oregano oil,
nitrogen chromate, and peppermint oil. But as night stretched on into the wee
hours of the morning, they adopted a more freewheeling approach. The next
notebook entry records that they tested coffee, eggs, sugar, and milk.<p>

Breakfast was scarcely the most exotic material to be harnessed during the
course of experimentation. Whale baleen, a tortoise shell, elephant hide, and
the hair of a native Amazonian are just a few of the items collected by Edison
in his obsessive quest for compounds with unique properties. One of his
colleagues joked that his lab storeroom held everything, including "the
eyeballs of a US senator." Although most of these substances had no practical
applications, a few did. Rain-forest nuts were compressed into bricks from which Edison made phonograph needles.
Japanese bamboo was fashioned into a filament for his commercial light. As for
the Amazonian's hair, it came in handy as a wig for the first talking doll, in
whose chest was concealed a tiny phonograph speaker.<p>

<h3>
Concepts
Mixed 
<br>
and
Matched
</h3>

	<font size=5>J</font><font size=3>UST as the inventor played with materials, he played with ideas,
suspending his critical faculties during the earliest stages of invention. In
an era before photocopying machines he developed an electric "pen"--really a
puncturing device that rapidly punched holes in a sheet of waxed paper, which
then served as a stencil for generating more copies. To make the point of the
pen vibrate up and down, Robert Rosenberg, the project director, reports,
Edison came up with concepts that "ranged from the practical to the absurd."
Rosenberg reviewed a series of drawings showing how the point might be set in
motion by a treadle mechanism reminiscent of an early Singer sewing machine, by
little waterwheels attached to the end of the shaft, by air pumps, or by an
electric motor tethered to the operator's wrist.<p>

Part of the impetus for Edison's dogged search for alternative solutions to
problems was his wish to cover himself with as broad a patent as possible. But
the project historians emphasize that Edison also simply exulted in the
challenge of inventing. It was a test of his ingenuity--almost a matter of pride--to see how many possibilities he could come up with. <p>

Although he cast a wide net initially, Edison would gradually become more
focused in his thinking. As his understanding of a problem grew, he typically
devised theories, tested them, and then narrowed the range of potential
solutions. Still, his inventive process at no stage resembled the linear, step-by-step
progression that the scientific method is supposed to be. Just when he appeared
to be putting the finishing touches on an invention, Edison would often go back
and review his earlier sketches to see if, in the light of the new knowledge he
had acquired, abandoned ideas could be resurrected. <p>

A single page from Edison's notebooks beautifully captures his remarkable
facility for mixing and matching concepts. It shows three different designs for
recording sound, from the time Edison first displayed his phonograph. Those
pictures foretell the main directions the recording industry would take
throughout the first half of the twentieth century.<p>

One sketch, illustrating the design Edison went on to market commercially,
shows a stylus pressed against a cylinder resembling a rolling pin. The so-called
"cylinder phonograph" derived directly from a cylinder version of his recording
telegraph. A second drawing features a grooved disc not unlike an LP record; it
sprang from the basic version of his telegraph recorder, the device that led to
the discovery that sound could be captured on paper or foil. The third drawing
foreshadows the tape recorder, with paper tape running under a stylus. The
project scholars believe that Edison got this idea from his work on earlier
printing and chemical telegraph systems, which had similar configurations. <p>

A closely related observation of the scholars--one with exciting implications for
school-based programs aimed at cultivating innovative minds--is that Edison employed similar
problem-solving strategies across numerous technologies. Notably, he reasoned by analogy, with
a distinctive repertoire of forms, models, and design solutions that he applied
to invention after invention. Reese Jenkins, who assembled and until last year
headed the Edison Papers Project staff, calls these repeating motifs in
Edison's work "theme and variations."<p>

To illustrate Edison's brand of logic, Jenkins holds up one of his first
drawings of the kinetoscope, a prototype motion-picture camera. "Notice any
similarity to his wax-cylinder phonograph?" he asks.<p>

The resemblance is obvious. Both phonograph and kinetoscope consist of an axle
supporting a cylinder that has information (either a sound recording or a
sequence of still photos) wound along its length. Each device also has a long
thin instrument (a stylus in the case of the phonograph and a viewing apparatus
in the case of the kinetoscope) held perpendicular to the surface of the
cylinder.<p>

Not surprisingly, these forms had a common origin. While Edison was working on
an improved model of the phonograph in 1888, Jenkins reports, he was paid a
visit by the photographer Eadweard Muybridge, who brought with him some of his
famous still photos of animals in motion. Inspired by these images, Edison
began to think about developing a moving picture in tandem with his other
project. Jenkins finds evidence of a conceptual link between the two inventions
in a patent caveat Edison drafted later that year, in which he announced, "I am
experimenting upon an instrument which does for the eye what the phonograph
does for the ear." He went on to describe the parallel between the spiral of
images that make up what we now call film and the spiral grooves on the
phonograph record.<p>

The motion-picture camera that evolved from Edison's kinetoscope ultimately
abandoned the cylinder in favor of reels of film, thus concealing from
generations of scholars its close kinship to the phonograph. "If we hadn't
looked at his notebooks and draft caveats," Jenkins points out, "we'd never
know what the original impetus for the idea was."<p>

</a></h3>
<font size=5>T</font><font size=3>HE Edison papers have brought to light another dimension of the inventor's
success: the brilliant scientist was also a clever businessman, and capable of
engineering literally dazzling public-relations stunts. In a bid to get New
York City to allow its streets to be torn up for the laying of electrical
cables, Edison invited the entire city council out to Menlo Park at dusk. He
directed the aldermen up a narrow staircase in the dark, and as they grumbled
and fumbled their way, he clapped his hands. On came a flood of lights,
illuminating a lavishly set dining hall complete with a sumptuous feast catered
by Delmonico's, then New York's premier restaurant.<p>

Edison knew how to use the rumor mill to enhance his professional image. He
portrayed his younger self as having been a guileless rube who didn't know what
to do with a check for $40,000 that he received shortly after arriving in New
York. The story--originally told by Edison is that after cashing the check, he
stuffed the bills into the lining of his coat. Edison loved to tell this
fabricated tale, possibly because it fit nicely with that era's image of the
wild, enterprising Yankee.<p>

Edison the private man is not nearly as scintillating as Edison the inventor
and self-promoter. "He had few of the endearing eccentricities commonly associated with genius,"
Greg Field says, expressing an opinion also held by his colleagues. Edison was
in many respects a typical Victorian man, with solid midwestern tastes. Like
many of his contemporaries, he was sheltered from women in his youth, and he
seems to have been genuinely chagrined to discover that his partner in marriage
would not be his partner at the laboratory bench. Just over a month after
marrying Mary Stilwell, the twenty-four-year-old Edison despaired in a notebook, "My wife Dearly Beloved Cannot invent worth a
Damn!!" He also shared with Americans of his background stereotypical
prejudices against Jews, Poles, Irishmen, and other newly arriving immigrant
groups (though ethnic biases apparently never stopped him from hiring anyone he
deemed talented).<p>

As he advanced in years, he became increasingly protective of his discoveries.
Lisa Gitelman, a project historian, recently uncovered an irate letter (circa
1916) from Edison to his manufacturing department. It had been prompted by the
news that teenagers were turning up the speed of his cylinder phonograph to
make the music faster. Instead of capitalizing on this trend, Edison
complained, "This change of speed is far worse than any loss due to having
dance records too slow. . . . They are absolutely right time but young folks of
the family want this fast time &amp; like stunts &amp; I dont want it &amp;
wont have it." To make sure his will was obeyed, he ordered his machinists to
make a governor for the motor.<p>

Of course, next to Edison's accomplishments, his shortcomings seem puny. Even
among other hallowed figures in the <A HREF="http://hfm.umd.umich.edu/">pantheon of inventors</A>, Edison is
Bunyanesque. What Henry Ford is to the automobile, George Eastman to
photography, and Charles Goodyear to rubber, Edison is to not one but several
of today's essential technologies. <p>

Is the Edison Papers Project helping to demystify his genius? "His ability to
reason by analogy and to learn from failure are certainly examples of traits
that should be useful to people of all sorts of talents and occupations," Paul
Israel says. "Nonetheless, when you see his mind at play in his notebooks, the
sheer multitude and richness of his ideas makes you recognize that there is
something that can't be understood easily that we may never be able to
understand."

This	paper is the substance of an address delivered at the annual meeting of the	American Association of Museums.</i></font><p>		<p>		<p><br><p><br>		<font size=5>W</font><font size=3>hat I shall talk about in this article defined itself in my mind after	visiting the museum in Pasadena to see once more the Huntington collection, and	after visits to the National Gallery in Washington--first to see the paintings	from the Berlin galleries, and then to see the crowds of people who were	climbing over one another to see the paintings from the Berlin galleries.<p>		<p>		<p>		There in California were collections of fine pictures, precious books, and	unique manuscripts, which had come finally to rest in a sanctuary as perfect	and as secure as the ingenuity and good will of man can provide. They are in a	building which is fireproof, earthquakeproof, air conditioned. They are guarded	like the children of a king by a corps of doctors, nurses, courtiers, and	secretaries. They live in a place so happily of no importance to any military	strategist that no general staff would waste an atomic bomb on them.<p>		<p>		<p>		And by contrast, there in Washington were the pictures from the Berlin	galleries, refugees from the retribution Hitler had brought down upon Berlin,	dug up from the salt mine in which they were buried, and now homeless	wanderers--destined to return to the land which could become the vortex of the	most terrible cataclysm in all history.<p>		<p>		<p>		The contrast is dramatic; and meditating on it, I said to myself that if all	goes well in the best of all possible worlds, the unique and irreplaceable	possessions of civilized men--at least all those that can be moved--will be	preserved against the vicissitudes of nature, and the destructiveness of men,	in sanctuaries like that in California.<p>		<p>		<p>		And then a disturbing thought occurred to me. The experience of man, and the	creations, inventions, discoveries of men throughout the ages and in an	infinite variety of circumstances, transcend our personal lives and our	immediate interests. This inheritance is worth collecting and preserving and	using--whatever our transient hopes and fears. Without it the life of man	would, as Hobbes said in another connection, be empty, nasty brutish, and	short.<p>		<p>		<p>		For if there were nothing for the spirit to work upon except its own reactions	to musings upon the immediate moment of time and a small spot of space, the	freedom of the human spirit would be vagrant and trivial. Without the	accumulated achievements of the past to work upon, the freedom of men would be	limited by the necessity of rediscovering and of repeating endlessly that which	has already been discovered and experienced. And since life is short and art is	long, not much would be discovered, and little would be created.<p>		<p>		<p>		Yet the supply of masterpieces of art and unique objects of great value is	limited, whereas all over the world, in every nation and in every city there is	a rising demand by greater and greater masses of people for access to these	masterpieces and unique objects.<p>		<p>		It is evident that there are not enough of them to stock the younger and newer	museums. The epoch of the great private collectors, which began in the	sixteenth century, is quite evidently nearing its end in the twentieth century	The masterpieces of the past which were once owned by private individuals are	passing into the hands of governments and corporate foundations. Except by	military conquest, there is less and less likelihood that they will be	redistributed. They are not for sale, as once they were, because the heirs of	the original collector were not interested in keeping them or were forced to	dispose of them. Broadly speaking, it may be said, therefore, that once	masterpieces and unique objects pass into the possession of existing museums,	they have reached their final resting place and are removed forever from the	market.<p>		<p>		Except against the furious destructiveness of modern war, the vandalism of	mobs, and the risks of natural catastrophes, the works which are movable will	have been deposited in museums which are sanctuaries for the preservation of	the relics. <p>		<p>		<p>		But how, then, are the great masses to be given access to their cultural	inheritance? A few, but only a few, can travel about the world visiting all the	museums making their pilgrimages to the sanctuaries. Only a few museums, here	and there, can have collections which are remotely representative even of the	elements of the great cultural traditions. In the nature of things, the works	they possess are bound to be accidental and arbitrary--to be collections of	bits and pieces--a portrait head from Egypt in Berlin, the Elgin marbles in	London, a Rubens in Cleveland, two dozen English paintings from the eighteenth	century in southern California.<p>		<p>		<p>		The problem becomes clearer if we compare the visual arts with literature.	Suppose that a lover of literature had to go to London to read Hamlet, to Paris	to read Macbeth, to Rome to read The Tempest, to Boston for some of the	Sonnets, to Chicago for others; suppose he had to go back to London, or Paris,	or Rome, or Boston, every time he wanted to read a work by Shakespeare The	enjoyment and the appreciation of literature would be a problem like that of	the enjoyment and appreciation of the fine arts.<p>		<p>		<p>		To put the matter this way is to pose the obvious question, which has occurred	to everyone who has thought about the problem. That is whether the unique	objects can be made generally accessible through reproductions. My friend John	Walker, Curator of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, states that	nearly sixty years ago there was a proposal by one F. W. Smith, which was	seriously considered at the time, to build within the District of Columbia on	an area of sixty-two acres "a wonderful agglomeration of magnificent	edifices...full size models of various monuments of all countries throughout	the ages... and filled with casts and copies of historic objects."<p>		<p>		<p>		Mr. Walker says that this curious and fantastic project was very nearly	undertaken. No doubt we may be thankful that it was not. But the basic idea	cannot be dismissed: it is one we are compelled to entertain when we face the	fact that the supply of unique objects is so limited and the public demand for	access to them so unlimited.<p>		<p>		<p>		Only recently Andre Malraux, who probably has never heard of F. W. Smith, said	that "the idea of a democratic culture which seemed vague and suspect in the	nineteenth century has grown clear and valid in the twentieth century because	of the development of the techniques for reproducing works of art."..."Painting	and music," he said, "have at last discovered their printing press."<p>		<p>		<p>		I wonder whether the directors of museums will not have to come to grips with	the whole complicated question of copies of works of fine art. One can imagine,	I venture to think, that the museum of the future will have two	departments--one the sanctuary where the unique objects, the irreplaceable	relics, are preserved and exhibited for the veneration and the enjoyment of	those who make the pilgrimage; the other department in effect a library for the	student, the scholar, and the amateur, where they can find, as in any library,	collected in one place and readily accessible to them various editions of the	unique objects which are scattered in the sanctuaries all over the world.<p>		<p>		<p>		It is interesting in this connection to remember that the most famous museum of	ancient times, the Museum of Alexandria, was, so the Encyclopaedia Britannica	says, a great library and home for scholars and that the conception of a museum	as a collection of antiquities is quite modern.<p>		<p>		<p>		<font size=4><b>2.</font></b><p>		<p>		A crucial question, obviously, is how far the technique of reproduction has	been perfected, and in what measure indeed it could be perfected. Any edition	of Shakespeare's plays which has been proofread accurately gives a reader as	good access to Shakespeare's art as if he owned one of the first folios now	deposited in the Folger Library. Is there something about a work of fine art	which can never even in theory be copied? Is the work which the master himself	put his hand to unique in its essence? And if it is, is this uniqueness in fact	aesthetic? Or is it--assuming that an indistinguishable copy could be	made--sentimental and historical?<p>		<p>		<p>		I suspect that questions like these cannot be answered dogmatically, and that	probably no one should attempt to answer them dogmatically. When Malraux says	that painting has found its printing press, the answer surely is--not yet. Even	an untrained eye can see that the color and texture of paintings are not now	faithfully reproduced. But can one say that if the effort were made to	reproduce them faithfully, that if the research were promoted and endowed,	eventually modern technology could not arrive at the equivalent of the printing	press?<p>		<p>		<p>		In the meantime, and as an inducement to remain open-minded, it may be useful	to analyze the idea of the unique object, attempting to isolate that which is	aesthetic from that which is sentimental, historical, and, if I may say so,	monopolistic.<p>		<p>		<p>		It is an interesting exercise in criticism to inquire into the purely aesthetic	reaction which the one and only original is uniquely able to produce. I think	anyone who visited the National Gallery in London last season and saw Philip	Hendy's exhibit of cleaned and uncleaned pictures must have come away from it	not quite so clear as he once was; no longer naively certain that he had been	reacting aesthetically to the original work of the master rather than to a	joint and changing product in which the first artist had collaborated with time	and circumstances across the centuries.<p>		<p>		<p>		But of all the many facets of this problem of the work of art as a unique	object, there is one which bears especially upon the theme that I have been	discussing. Not all the paintings which are exhibited in museums are	indubitably the original work of a surely identified artist. This fact has	given rise to a fascinating profession--that of the connoisseurs who determine	the attributions and perform in the world of art the functions of Sherlock	Holmes and J. Edgar Hoover.<p>		<p>		<p>		Theirs is, I have always thought, an enviable profession, full of mystery and	romance. The innocent child who has been disowned and forgotten is recognized	at last as the true prince of the realm, and the villainous pretender is cast	into outer darkness and stored in the cellar. I look upon the great man-hunts	of the connoisseurs as a preview of how we shall pass the time in the brave new	world of the future when all the problems of war and poverty and class and	caste have been solved, and we need thrillers--not as now to put us to sleep	but to keep us awake.<p>		<p>		<p>		The existence among us of these aesthetic sleuths is good evidence, I think,	that the enjoyment of art is not altogether a simple, intuitive reaction in the	presence of a masterpiece. If it were, what difference did it make that the	alleged Vermeer in Rotterdam, which was so greatly enjoyed by lovers of	Vermeer, was proved to have been the work of a modern forger? If all that	matters is the purely aesthetic effect, then what is the purpose of the whole	apparatus of scholarship, the search of the documents, the X-rays, and the	chemical tests?<p>		<p>		<p>		Does not our concern with attribution indicate that for modern men aesthetic	enjoyment is almost inseparable from knowledge, that feeling alone does not	satisfy us, but needs the support of understanding--so that if I may take the	liberty of paraphrasing Plotinus, our passions may be intellectual and our	intellects passionate? I think it does, and that is one more reason, and	perhaps the most conclusive of all, why modern museums can no longer be, as	they were a generation ago, places where original works are preserved and	exhibited--why they are becoming also libraries and laboratories of research	and education.<p>		<p>		<p>		For the unique objects which any one museum can possess, however fine each of	them may be, are incapable of satisfying the need to understand, the need to	see not only the unique object, as such, in isolation, but to see it in the	context of the whole work of the artist and of his school and of his period and	of his culture. Without the context, which depends on the apparatus of	knowledge, aesthetic enjoyment--because of the arbitrary and random scattering	of works of art all over the world--would be mere eclecticism, the expenditure	of emotion on a series of disconnected, unrelated, and inherently meaningless	objects. For only knowledge can impose order and intelligibility upon the	feelings and passions, which, if they are excited capriciously can never be	satisfied, and become diseased. Thus it is only by the cultivation of the	knowledge of the comparative history of art that modern men, exposed as they	are to odd collections of bits and pieces of the creative world of all the	ages, can begin to cope with the flux and the chaos of modernity.<p>		<p></blockquote><p><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../index.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1948 by Walter Lippman.

2.7.5 --></head><body>HEN I visited Stockholm</A>, late last summer, I was prepared to keep my eye on
design. Blond Scandinavian furniture, after all, defined forward-thinking
sophistication when I was growing up, and big floral Marimekko prints in a
living room meant that its occupant wanted to make the world a better place.
More recently sophistication in design has meant taking inspiration from the
blond neoclassical furniture named for King Gustav III, the eighteenth-century
Swedish aesthete; the Swedish company Ikea is among the leaders of a revival of
a style that looks like delicate, sun-bleached French Provincial.<p>

I was happily surprised to find that Stockholm is filled with echoes and
expressions of two of my favorite styles--Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts,
which co-existed in the 1890s and the first decades of this century. Every city
has a defining era. Stockholm's was the Belle Epoque, when <A HREF="http://www.nobel.se/nobelpages/page16.html">Alfred Nobel</A> was
amassing the explosives-based fortune that would allow him to establish his
prizes, and when the profits of industrialization were changing the face of the
city. The streets the guidebooks will tell you to wander are the preserved
medieval ones of Gamla Stan, Stockholm's old town, with their imposing baroque
palaces. They are indeed charming, but the streets that delighted me most were
those of Ostermalm, a fashionable residential neighborhood in the center, where
I saw everywhere perfectly maintained examples of the restrained, elegant
Swedish versions of both Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts architecture.
Ostermalm's indoor market, for instance, which houses the city's best
victuallers, has the Edwardian grandness, the wrought-iron flourishes and
polished mahogany counters, of Harrods Food Halls--not to mention the silkiest
herring I've ever tasted, and little cartons of tiny wild strawberries and
juicy, pillow-soft cloudberries picked in the Swedish countryside.<p>

I would return to Vienna, Barcelona, or Budapest simply to walk at liberty
through its Art Nouveau neighborhoods, and now Stockholm, too, is on my list.
Given Sweden's fierce and long-standing love of nature, its artists and
craftsmen found special resonance in the sinuous natural forms of Art Nouveau.
The new wealth of the period helped them to further Sweden's first
internationally recognized painting style, called National Romantic for its
Barbizon-influenced landscapes. Nobel wanted to be the eternal patron of the
world's intellectual heritage; his fellow industrialists were content to
glorify themselves and their friends, and those friends were often architects
and artists.<p>

In the course of my wandering I devised an Art Nouveau itinerary, which
includes a stop for herring or pastries at that carriage-trade market. The main
attractions are three house museums that distill the creative ferment that
transformed Stockholm from 1890 to 1910. Touring the three, to which guidebooks
puzzlingly give short shrift, will also surround a visitor with the city's most
appealing landscapes--both urban and parklike.<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE tone of the tour is ideally set by a stop at the Royal Dramatic Theater, a
white-and-gold Art Nouveau monument, built from 1901 to 1908, that seems to be
a vision from Vienna. The building stands out like a beacon, facing both a
major intersection and a busy canal; its bas reliefs, of a commedia dell'arte
troupe and a Dionysian procession, are visible from as far away as the next
islands. (<A HREF="http://www.sunet.se/stockholm/">Stockholm</A> is built on fourteen islands, and is situated in an
archipelago of about 25,000 of them.) I bought a ticket to a Moli&egrave;re
play performed in Swedish in order to have a better look at the marble-and-gilt
interior and to sit on the plush red seats. No, I didn't make it to the end,
but I did feel as if I had spent time in the Gilded Age.<p>

Two buildings down the canal, which forms one border of Ostermalm, is the 1910
Hotel Esplanade, whose curvaceous Art Nouveau fa&ccedil;ade and interior
furnishings are largely intact. I can't vouch for the service: I stayed at the
aptly named <A HREF="http://www.sunet.se/IETF33/gh.html">Grand Hotel</A>, where I had to content myself with a beautiful
gray-and-silver Gustavian room. Also near the theater is the first of the house
museums, the Hallwyl, a palace designed by Isak Gustaf Clason and built in the
1890s for the Countess Wilhelmina von Hallwyl and her Swiss-born army-captain
husband. The countess, a timber heiress, collected seemingly everything in
sight--armor and swords and scabbards, French and Belgian tapestries,
furniture, Chinese porcelain from uninteresting periods. Some of her
acquisitions merited the money she doubtless doled out: superb early Meissen
ceramics and, in an upstairs gallery next to a private gymnasium, a stunning
Cranach of a nude Venus. I was most drawn, though, to the building itself, a
concoction of Venetian arches and Spanish Gothic and Renaissance themes (and
vast bathrooms), all expressed in an unmistakable Art Nouveau vocabulary.<p>

A sympathetic guard told me that if I liked the house and wanted to see really
good art, I should go to his favorite museum in Stockholm, one that few people
know--the Thiel Gallery, another large house built at the turn of the century
by a rich collector. This collector, though, Ernest Thiel, befriended the best
artists of the time. Just take the bus outside, the guard said, to the end of
Djurg&aring;rden. He didn't know that the bus would leave me at the bridge,
blocked by a women's marathon, and that I would spend the next hour getting to
the museum by foot --the only choice that day.<p>

The unplanned excursion turned out to be the pleasantest of my stay.
Djurg&aring;rden ("Animal Park") is the greenest of the city's islands, and one
of the largest; residents treat the whole of it as their park. Swedish friends
explained to me that every Stockholmer's goal is to leave the city as often as
possible for a rustic retreat; they didn't tell me how easy it is for
Stockholmers to fulfill their rural desires in the city--fishing for salmon
just outside their office buildings (the city spends a fortune to keep the
water clean), taking city hikes as a matter of course. Visitors will find
renting a bicycle to be an easy alternative to the efficient public
transportation; for someone unfamiliar with the streets and bridges, a car
would be inconvenient, and would miss the point--Stockholmers seem to rely on
foot and boat.<p>

After mistaking several other Belle Epoque mansions for it, I reached the
house, dramatically set on a far hill overlooking the water. The Thiel Gallery
has cleaner lines than its neighboring mansions, as is logical: Thiel was a
robber baron with avant-garde tastes. After making a fortune as a banker who
speculated in railroads and shipbuilding, he married his children's governess;
the couple ran an artistic salon in the house they built together. The sunniest
room is Mrs. Thiel's white-and-yellow sewing room, with its many watercolors by
Carl Larsson. Today Sweden's most popular artist, Larsson celebrated domestic
life working in an Art Nouveau style that just skirts the saccharine.<p>

The less sunny rooms are more interesting. The gallery that makes the Thiel
worth a hike (on most days a bus does stop nearby) houses noteworthy pictures
by Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec, Manet, and Vuillard. These are, however, rendered
almost incidental by twelve big and important paintings by <A HREF="http://www9.omix.com/web/norway/history/people/munch.html">Edvard Munch</A>. The
artist picked the canvases especially for Thiel, his close friend, and the
group--the largest assembly of Munch paintings in Sweden--is of special
interest for its reflection of the friendship between artist and patron. One
painting, <i><A HREF="http://kelvin.marine.usf.edu/~grey/web5/despair.html">Despair</A></i>, is a precursor to <i>The Scream</i>; the only
difference between them is the central figure on the hellish bridge, in this
painting a hatted man seen in profile. There are also several works by <A HREF="http://www.jmk.su.se/jmk/stud/H93-120/d-hedjon/index.html">August
Strindberg</A>, who painted throughout his writing career. His canvases, not
surprisingly, are dark and stormy. A somber room at the top of the house's
tower is filled with black-and-white etchings and drawings by Munch, and
contains Friedrich Nietzsche's death mask as well.<p>

The Thiels collected works by many other artists, including the most famous
local painter of the time, Anders Zorn, and also by the makers of the Arts and
Crafts furniture that is placed throughout the house. Some of the furniture is
domestic and elegant, and some massive and deliberately primitive, as if copied
from a Gauguin painting of Tahiti. The couple's fortunes and thus their
patronage waned; by the 1920s Thiel was bankrupt, and his wife had divorced
him. In 1924 he was forced to sell the house and his art to the state.<p>

Thiel had originally wanted to buy a similarly dramatic site on
Djurg&aring;rden, closer to town. But Prince Eugen, the youngest son of King
Oscar II, commissioned the same architect Thiel used, Ferdinand Boberg, to
build a mansion on a site near the parcel Thiel had eyed. Prince Eugen was an
accomplished painter of the National Romantic school, of which he was also a
patron (he continued to collect Swedish art until the 1940s). His house,
furnished with pretty Swedish rococo furniture and still filled with large
fresh flower arrangements, as stipulated in his will, is more opulent than
Thiel's, and in better taste; if the large adjoining gallery of art contains
paintings that are less distinguished, the architecture is finer.
Waldemarsudde, as the house is called, is especially lovely for its
English-style gardens, which are adjacent to a big red-shingled
eighteenth-century windmill. The garden benches face brick Arts and Crafts
factories across the water.<p>

<font size=5>W</font>ALKING along the embankment, I looked into the gardens of many houses from the
same period, by turns grand and cottagelike. Returning toward town, I came to
<A HREF="http://www.telemuseum.se/museer/Skansen/SKANSENENGELSKA">Skansen</A>, a living museum encompassing more than a hundred farms, houses,
churches, and shops from all over the country, reconstructed on site; a
marketplace; and a zoo with aquarium. Tourists come to Djurg&aring;rden to
visit Skansen and to see the <i><A 
HREF="http://www.sunet.se/stockholm/museums/vasa/vasa.html">Vasa</A></i>, a warship that sank about twenty
minutes into its maiden voyage, in 1628. I was unmoved by the <i>Vasa</i>,
despite its spectacular state of preservation, but enchanted by Skansen. Its
founder, Artur Hazelius, began creating a miniature Sweden in the 1890s. Like
all early ethnographers, Hazelius worried that the rise of industry would
obliterate folk traditions. He wanted to preserve not just old buildings,
costumes, tools, and artifacts but animals and plants, too, and so he stocked
the old log barns with breeds from their places of origin.<p>

As at Colonial Williamsburg and Old Sturbridge Village, people of all ages
wearing period costumes suddenly come alongside one, acting out a scene. When I
was there, young boys in nineteenth-century dress whisked off visitors to join
them on a trip to America; at the grocer's, children in period dress who didn't
have to playact their greed pushed in front of me to buy hard candies in paper
cones. I didn't mind a bit--perhaps because before going to the grocer I had
visited the period bakery and sampled nearly everything available, which that
day included pretzels and puffy apricot turnovers, both made from the same
strongly cardamom-scented yeast dough, and marvelous fresh vanilla-custard
tarts in a star shape. (When I asked for some of the dark seeded bread, the
white-suited baker rapped a loaf against a shelf: it was a painted rock.) These
were the best pastries I tried in Stockholm--and I tried a lot.<p>

Djurg&aring;rden is its own island escape, but with thousands of islands for a
visitor to choose from, the archipelago provides many other possible
excursions. Of the several islands I visited, the one that left the strongest
impression and seemed most in keeping with my itinerary was Fjaderholmen, an
artists' colony twenty minutes by ferry from the terminal across from the Royal
Dramatic Theater. The village, only a bit self-consciously quaint, offers
paintings and various crafts, including blown glass, by local artisans--the
successors to the nature-intoxicated artists who made the city look as it does.
A big, pretty restaurant on the water, Fjaderholmarnas Krog, offers updated
Swedish cuisine.<p>

My dinner there, one of the last of my trip, was the meal I liked best. Even
though I usually frown on modernized cuisine, preferring to sample the
originals, I didn't mind the lightened fish and game dishes, given how stodgy
the real thing could be. The several kinds of herring, fresh and brined and
smoked, were luxuriously oily and powerfully flavored, and the wheaty
crispbread was homemade. Before supper I walked around the island, with its
rustic houses like modern log cabins, to watch the sunset. It couldn't have
been much more than a mile around. By then that felt like nothing.<p>

<blockquote>

	<center><i><font size=4>A much-praised campaign to 

	teach adults to read is showing other states new ways 

	to attack illiteracy.</i></font></center><p>

	

	

	<pre>

	

	</pre>

	

	<font size=5>I</font>n the little brick town hall in Bolton, Mississippi, a dignified elderly black

man in wire-rim spectacles, denim overalls, and bright-red basketball sneakers

sat curled in concentration over a booklet of fifth-grade math problems. While

the sunset reddened the horizon and the town's ancient cotton gin clattered

through the twilight, Bryant Mack, Jr., age sixty-two, was finally learning to

read and write and do arithmetic.<p>



<p>



"See, my daddy didn't have no learning," he said shyly. "He didn't think it was

important. I was one of twelve children. We all had to work in the cotton

fields. Only time we went to school was when it rained. There were no real

schools for black kids back then, anyway. Truth is, I didn't have a childhood.

I know I'm not alone in that."<p>



<p>



Not by a long shot. By now the figures are familiar: there are said to be 20

million to 40 million adults nationwide who cannot read and write and add well

enough to perform ordinary tasks like passing a driver's-license test, reading

a warning label on a medicine bottle, and--Bryant Mack's goal--balancing a

checkbook. What is not so well known is that a disproportionate number of

America's functional illiterates, black and white, live in the South, where

their economic situation is deteriorating rapidly. In Alabama, Florida,

Georgia, Mississippi, and the Carolinas the average earnings of male high

school dropouts aged twenty to thirty-four plummeted 35.5 percent from 1973 to

1985.<p>



<p>



Cotton hasn't been king for several generations, and the days when southern

states could attract sweatshop industries with cheap wages, strong backs, and

low taxes are over. Employment in the textile and apparel-manufacturing

industries has dropped because of automation and competition from low-wage

labor in Third World countries. The road to economic growth nowadays is paved

with a high level of reading comprehension and sophisticated technical

skills.<p>



<p>



In the era of the information economy and flexible production, the old Dixie

politics of exclusion--keeping blacks uneducated and poor whites ignorant--seem

as irrelevant as Stalinist dogma must now seem in the Soviet Union.

Mississippi's young governor, Ray Mabus, a Democrat who is believed to have

been elected with 90 percent of Mississippi's black vote, has arrived at a

difficult crossroads, where the utilitarian needs of industry for skilled labor

intersect the legacy of segregation: illiteracy, poverty, and despair. How well

Mabus and other politicians negotiate that intersection could determine whether

the Democratic Party has a chance of winning back the once solidly Democratic

South--or whether the Republicans can win the black votes they seek by

recognizing a human issue that has a relatively small price tag and big

potential in terms of its economic multiplier effect.<p>



<p>



Mississippi under the Mabus administration has launched the most ambitious

initiative in the nation to combat adult illiteracy. Having come through in

1988 on his campaign promise to give teachers their biggest pay raise in the

state's history, Governor Mabus and his wife, Julie, a former high school math

teacher who tirelessly preaches the new gospel of education for economic

development, have vowed that nine out of ten Mississippians will be

functionally literate by the year 2000, a monumental task that amounts to a

holy war on illiteracy. Mabus has staked his political future on a

comprehensive education-reform program, including a proposed $13.5 million

worth of new state funds to be earmarked for adult-literacy programs over the

next three years.<p>



<p>



When education fervor swept the United States after Russia's launching of

Sputnik, the deep South was preoccupied with school desegregation and the

civil-rights movement. The Mississippi legislature repealed legislation that

made schooling compulsory, and encouraged white flight from the public schools

by allowing the schools to deteriorate. By 1982, when Governor William Winter

finally got an education-reform law through the Mississippi legislature, on his

third try (the law made school attendance mandatory to age sixteen and

established kindergartens statewide for the first time), the Mississippi school

system was a wreck. Each year approximately 6,000 children didn't even start

school. The state's high school students had among the lowest achievement-test

scores and among the highest dropout rates in the country. But it wasn't only

support for integrated education that was lacking. "The ideal of universal

education was itself absent in Mississippi," Winter, now a lawyer in Jackson,

the state capital, told me recently.<p>



<p>



The anti-intellectualism of the rural South often attached more importance to

football and cheerleading than to learning to read local authors like Eudora

Welty and William Faulkner. Some fathers quit their jobs, and sons left school,

on the first day of hunting season; a vestigial frontier mentality held that

"too much book learnin' ruins your shootin' eye." And it is often said in Bible

Belt churches that "Satan can quote Scripture"--even if the deacons can't. In

Mississippi 714,000 adults--46 percent of the state's adult population--lack

high school diplomas. Roughly 400,000 adult Mississippians have less than nine

years of schooling, a level that is often used as a definition of functional

illiteracy.<p>



<p>



Certainly this definition makes for a conservative estimate of illiteracy,

given that Mississippi high schools share the national tendency to graduate

anyone who occupies a desk long enough. "I went through twelve years of school

and two years of community college without ever learning to read, and passed

with flying colors," Treaise Williams, a twenty-five-year-old woman in Jackson,

told me. "I found out early that if I was always the teacher's pet, they

wouldn't fail me. I always listened real good to what the teachers said. When

you can't read, you figure out all kinds of ways round your handicap. A lot of

times illiterates are intelligent, but they been made to feel dumb."<p>



<p>



Williams was spunky enough to find her way to a program in "life coping

skills," where she works one night a week developing the reading skills she

will need to pass a cosmetology licensing exam, her hope for economic

improvement. But such success stories are rare. For the vast majority of

miseducated adults, made to "feel dumb" all their lives and to hide their

shameful "handicap," adult-literacy programs up till now have also been

failures.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



In the South such programs reach only about one in thirty of the undereducated

population. A recent study by the Sunbelt Institute, a think tank convened by

southern congressmen and governors, concluded that the federal Adult Education

Act of 1966, which makes block grants for state literacy endeavors, "has never

been funded at a level sufficient to provide much more than a token response to

the nation's literacy needs." New federal literacy legislation, introduced by

Senator Paul Simon, of Illinois, and Representative Thomas Sawyer, of Ohio, has

thus far failed to win support from the Bush Administration.<p>



<p>



Once federal funding trickles through state bureaucracies to the local level,

it usually disappears into programs that have never been made to develop

standards or evaluate results. Few programs, for example, take account of what

motivates illiterate adults to enroll in the first place, although countries

like Brazil and Nicaragua have been most successful in cutting their illiteracy

rates by relying on the educator Paulo Freire's method of teaching reading with

what the nonreaders actually want to be able to understand--such as a tractor

manual for a farmer. Even fewer American literacy programs address the shame,

sense of failure, and everyday problems that most poor nonreaders must overcome

before obtaining help. Elloris Cooper, the supervisor of adult reading programs

for Mississippi's Hinds Community College, says, "There's a whole constellation

of things poor people face that make potential adult learners hard to reach,

hard to recruit, and even harder to keep in programs, beginning with

transportation to classes and child care for young mothers."<p>



<p>



Nationwide more than half the adults who enter literacy-training programs

simply abandon the effort after a few sessions of instruction, without having

improved their reading skills. In Mississippi only 10 percent of adults stay

with literacy classes long enough to complete two workbooks of the standard

Laubach method of reading. This brings them, at best, to a fourth-grade reading

level after a hundred hours of classes, at a typical cost of $3,500 per

student.<p>



<p>



In rural areas the difficulty of reaching and keeping students is compounded by

the problem of finding competent tutors. The much-publicized effort of Barbara

Bush to enlist volunteer literacy teachers ignores the facts that the highest

illiteracy rates often occur where the fewest volunteers are available, and

that little national effort has been made either to mobilize young people in a

literacy corps or to professionalize the teaching of adults to read. "In one

community we service, only six percent of the population have graduated from

high school," says Betty Jo Dulaney, the literacy-coordinator in Tunica County.

The county is Mississippi's poorest; more than half the population there lives

below the poverty line. "There's no industry here, so anyone with job skills or

gumption takes the first bus out. Now, where am I supposed to find reading

tutors?"<p>



<p>



Nonreaders are ineligible to enter most job-training programs. For many, then,

succeeding in an adult-literacy class is the last chance to lead a productive

life. Isiah Charleston is an electric-utility technician who has been active in

literacy and community-development projects for the past fifteen years in the

backwoods of Warren County, outside Vicksburg. Ride the dirt roads with him and

you descend into a social maelstrom, where teenage pregnancies, incest, and

alcoholism are common, and apathy has become a way of life. Charleston fights

back tears when he assesses the lost generation of rural black youth which has

followed formal desegregation. "After having dropped out of school in the

eighth or ninth grade, our young people get into a pattern of quitting," he

told me. "They quit school, they quit jobs, they quit literacy

programs--finally they just quit trying to improve themselves altogether. They

lack what my teachers used to call stick-to-itive-ness. Only way Mississippi's

going to get up off the bottom is if we give these kids something to stay in

school for, something to work toward in their lives."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Mississippi's initiative focuses on the concept of context. "First, we are

looking at the whole system of literacy programs and making fundamental

structural changes," Julie Mabus told me in an interview at the governor's

mansion. "The old way of teaching adults to read--in a vacuum, without taking

into account their own immediate hopes and aims--is just no good."<p>



<p>



To direct the program overhaul, the Mabus administration created a new Office

for Literacy and chose a nationally recognized literacy expert, Karl Haigler,

the head of the Adult Literacy Initiative at the U.S. Department of Education,

to run it. Haigler had worked under William Bennett to co-write the federal

manual on designing effective work-force literacy programs whose curricula are

based on specific job contexts and the real-life needs of workers. Haigler's

arrival in Mississippi, in 1988, presaged a wholesale redirection of the

state's effort. The state intends to concentrate on parents and adults needing

job-related basic-skills training. It also intends to enlist the business

community as the political backbone of a long-term, high-profile literacy

campaign.<p>



<p>



"We're getting rid of the 'grade-level' thinking that says a person is literate

when he or she obtains a high-school-equivalency diploma," Haigler told me.

"Literacy is better defined as a continuum of skills, ranging from simple

decoding of written matters to high levels of critical thinking and

problem-solving. Programs need to be redesigned to meet a whole array of actual

social needs, from the assembly-line worker who needs to read charts and

manuals to the person whose greatest desire is to read her Bible."<p>



<p>



Thus an innovative mobile unit, mounted on a tractor trailer donated by the

Frito-Lay Company and outfitted with computers and educational software under

various grants, was dispatched to Iuka, in the northeast corner of the state.

The town had an unemployment rate of 23 percent. Construction started this

spring on a NASA plant in Iuka that will manufacture rockets for the space

shuttle. The idea is to provide on-site, job-specific, walk-in reading help to

those applying for the 1,800 construction jobs. The state plans to have

additional mobile units available for short-term spot literacy missions in a

few years. Also, the Office for Literacy has been instrumental in making

available to businesses and communities "literacy audits," to assess their

particular reading needs, and suggesting local resources available to meet

them, such as a nearby community college or military base.<p>



<p>



In order for literacy programs to qualify for a portion of the $2 million in

federal funds that Governor Mabus set aside last year for adult literacy

training, they must develop an individual education plan for every learner. The

plans--an innovation in literacy work borrowed from the special-education

field--are designed by students together with their tutors, and are meant to

ensure a high level of student commitment by tailoring the curriculum to the

student's goals. Now, for example, the teenage mother who hopes to break a

generational cycle of ignorance by learning to read stories to her child won't

find herself in a literacy class struggling through a ninth-grade

social-studies textbook.<p>



<p>



Such reforms make the state's literacy programs more effective and accountable,

Haigler argues, without bureaucratization. "We're looking for diversity and

local initiative to drive this campaign forward," he told me. "We're not going

to have the bureaucrats come in and dictate literacy policy."<p>



<p>



Another area in which Mississippi is breaking ground is in the use of computer

technology to teach reading. After an initial flurry of interest from software

developers when the national literacy crisis hit the headlines, the industry

turned hesitant in the face of a flat, small, and penniless market for literacy

programming. Nevertheless, Julie Mabus looked at the small pool of volunteer

tutors available in Mississippi and decided that one-on-one volunteer tutoring

alone would not solve the problem.<p>



<p>



The emphasis on technology has helped rally the Mississippi business community

behind the Mabus initiative, and a variety of high-tech literacy-training

programs have been launched. In a joint venture with Peavey Electronics, one of

the state's largest manufacturers, Mississippi became one of the first states

to use a civilian version of the Army's computer-based Job Skills Education

Program, used to train military recruits.<p>



<p>



Although the emphasis on high technology has drawn attention from foundations

and industry, and brought new outside funding to Mississippi, it has some

literacy activists worried. Liberals are worried that narrowly focused,

business-oriented reading instruction will fail to achieve literacy's primary

civic mission of preparing underprivileged citizens to participate in the

democratic process. Other critics simply think that the pressure to be

technologically innovative is warping priorities. "You can't bring down the

thunder every time you write a funding proposal," says Ronnie Blackwell, who

heads the Hattiesburg Education Literacy Project. "We don't need fantastic new

software, we need okay software that illiterates can actually use. With all the

talk about literacy technology and the funding for it, the grass-roots programs

where people actually learn to read are really suffering. Our staff--the people

who do the one-on-one teaching--haven't been paid in six weeks. We need

long-term funding or we're all going to sink."<p>



<p>



In the event, Mississippi's illiteracy problem is likely to get worse in the

short run. And literacy trainers admit that even with all the effort and

funding the state is marshaling for its initiative they are barely scratching

the surface of the problem. Children, they point out, are quitting school every

day. If the state is to make progress against illiteracy, it must stem the tide

of school dropouts and teenage pregnancies. Thirty percent of the babies born

in the Delta are born to teenage mothers.<p>



<p>



Perhaps the most significant initiative is Governor Mabus's attempt to prevent

teenagers from dropping out. Mabus has proposed to cut the school-dropout rate

in half by providing schools with funds to identify youths at risk of dropping

out and to design alternative programs that will keep them in school. The

governor has also called for a new "family literacy" program, modeled on the

award-winning Kenan Family Literacy Project, in Kentucky, and others. In these

programs young welfare mothers can obtain reading help together with their

preschool offspring. Mississippi's new programs, however, are to be paid for by

Governor Mabus's education-reform package, which has been threatened in the

legislature for reasons related to funding, as the "read my lips, no new taxes"

mentality takes hold at the state level.<p>



<p>



The literacy initiative is bringing Mississippi unaccustomed positive national

prominence. The program reforms and technological innovations will be studied

as models and inspiration elsewhere. Yet the odds may be against the Mabuses in

their war on illiteracy. Their commitment may not be sufficient to make up for

years of purposeful educational neglect, and few states, let alone the poorest

in the nation, have the resources to reverse the trends of illiteracy and

underdevelopment. "There is a national interest involved here," William Winter,

the former governor, told me. "We cannot just isolate sections of the country

like the Mississippi Delta and leave them to their own devices. We don't live

in separate enclaves. Unless we have a national commitment to sustain an

adequate standard of education, health care, and child welfare, the level of

performance of the country as a whole ultimately suffers."

<h4>Environment</h4>

	

Peak hurricane season begins this month; areas in the paths of storms may 

be better prepared this year than in the past, owing to the introduction of 

a new jet aircraft to help forecast the track and landfall of hurricanes.  

The <A HREF="http://rap.nas.edu/lab/NOAA/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric 

Administration</A>--the government agency responsible for issuing public 

<img src="wind.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

warnings about hurricanes--will be using a specially modified business jet, 

a high-tech supplement to the agency's other two hurricane-surveillance 

planes.  Able to survey a wider area and gather information from the 

periphery of storms, the new jet will focus on the "steering currents" of 

hurricanes--the forces around them that determine how they will move.  

Officials predict that the accuracy of 24- to 48-hour hurricane-track 

predictions will improve by 20 percent.  More-accurate forecasts should not 

only save lives and property but also reduce the tens of millions of 

dollars spent each year as a result of exaggerated hurricane warnings.

This month fishermen and divers off the coast of Maine will begin gathering 

the season's yield of <A

urchins.</A> They face fewer harvesting days than in previous years, owing 

to conservation measures enacted by the state last April.  Urchiners will

be limited to 150 or 170 gathering days a year, depending on their 

location.  Urchin roe is a delicacy in Japan, where it sells for as much as 

$100 a pound; however, urchins were considered merely a nuisance by Maine 

fishermen until overfishing depleted stocks in Japan and California a 

decade ago.  They are now the state's second most lucrative catch (after 

lobster), but overfishing is already taking a toll: the yield dropped from 

41 million pounds in 1993 to 32 million last year.  And as urchins become 

scarcer, divers are descending to more dangerous depths to retrieve them, 

increasing the potential for diving injuries and deaths.  <h4>

Both parties hold their nominating conventions this month, later than usual 

in deference to the summer Olympics.  <A

will meet August <b>26-29 </b>in Chicago.  Also this month the Prime Time 

Access Rule--a Federal Communications Commission regulation that prohibited 

NBC, ABC, and CBS affiliates in the nation's 50 largest television markets 

from broadcasting network programs for more than three of the four prime 

evening viewing hours--expires on August <b>30</b>, after 26 years.  The 

rule was intended to encourage creative programming from local stations and 

independent producers.  In reality, however, it gave rise chiefly to 

non-network syndicated game shows and tabloid magazine shows.  The FCC 

concluded last year that the networks no longer dominate television to such 

an extent that the rule has merit.  Viewers may notice few changes in the 

short term, because of existing contracts and the popularity of much 

syndicated fare.  In the long term there is likely to be an increase in 

reruns of network situation comedies and a growth in network-produced shows 

for syndication.

	Elizabeth Janeway, writing in the August, 1971, issue of <i>The Atlantic

Monthly</i>: "Our current religion--reason, science and technology--has had

remarkable success in remaking the external world. It has come close to

fulfilling promises of material comfort for all instead of luxury for a tiny

&eacute;lite which, two hundred years ago, must have seemed mythically unreal.

But our progress toward this goal has shown that, like any single vision, such

an aim leaves too much out; in this case, the emotional satisfaction of the

congregation of the Church of Reason. Result: the upspringing of alternative

patterns of belief whose nuttiness survives reasoned argument because reason

itself has come to seem irreparably nutty."

	HE presidential election of 1996 places a paradox before us. Polls and other
reports show that the public is disillusioned with politics. With one era--the
era of the Cold War--having ended, and another, undefined era before us, the
voters clearly want to turn a new page in political life. Yet the two major
parties have chosen two quintessential Washington politicians, President Bill
Clinton and the former Senate majority leader Bob Dole, as their candidates.
<img src="Politic3.gif" align=center hspace=10 vspace=10>
<br>
Have the voters somehow been disenfranchised? Has a mighty establishment
suffocated the popular will, as so many voters now believe? The answers to these
questions may lie in deep changes that have occurred in the structure of the
electoral system.  <p>

Since the New Hampshire primary, in February, I have been following the
presidential campaign for <i>Newsday</i>. It has often been said this year that
the erosion of the middle class threatens to divide us into two Americas, one
rich and one poor. On the campaign trail, however, I noticed a slightly
different division--one that runs down the center not of the economic but of
the political realm. On one side is the America of those who are political
professionals. It comprises politicians, their advisers and employees, and the
news media. Politicians waste little love on the newspeople who cover them, and
the newspeople display a surly skepticism toward politicians as a badge of
honor. Yet if the voters I met on the campaign trail are any indication (and
poll data suggest that they are), much of the public has lumped newspeople and
politicians together into a single class, which, increasingly, it despises.
Respect for the government and respect for the news media have declined in
tandem. More and more the two appear to the public to be an undifferentiated
establishment--a new Leviathan--composed of rich, famous, powerful people who
are divorced from the lives of ordinary people and indifferent to their
concerns. <p>

On the other side of the division is the America of political amateurs:
ordinary voters. They are above all a class of spectators--except, of course,
on Election Day. This division of American politics into two worlds is in one
sense as old as the Constitution, which by founding a representative democracy
established a class of people who, as elected officials, would participate
fully in political life, and a much larger class of people who, whatever else
they might do as citizens, would participate in the formal political system
only during elections. The search for intermediate institutions to span the
yawning gulf between these two classes has always been a central problem of
American democracy. Thomas Jefferson worried that "the abstract political
system of democracy lacked concrete organs." He tirelessly but unsuccessfully
advocated the formation of "ward" councils as local participatory bodies. In
the mid nineteenth century Alexis de Tocqueville famously noted the countless
civic associations that had grown up to bridge the gap. The political parties,
with their vast, often corrupt local machines, have perhaps been the most
important and enduring bridge. Today, however, all the traditional intermediate
institutions, including the parties, are in sharp decline, and their place is
being taken by professional campaigns and the news media. <p>

Thus the <i>activity</i> of politics has increasingly become an interaction, at
once antagonistic and incestuous, between the media and the people running the
campaigns. Everyone else is an onlooker. The line that separates newspeople
from politicians is one that both groups seek to sharpen but that in fact is
increasingly blurred, while the line that separates both from the public is one
that politicians and press would like to erase but in fact grows steadily
sharper. Indeed, rarely has there been a line of separation between classes as
sharp and clear as the line that divides the new class of political
participants from the larger class of political spectators: it is as sharp as
the line that divides a person being photographed from the photographer, or the
people in a focus group from the pollster watching them from behind a one-way
mirror, or the people who glow on the television screen from the mass of
anonymous viewers in the dimness of their living rooms. By comparison, the lord
on his estate was as one with the peasants in his fields, to whom he was tied
by innumerable social bonds. Even the divide between fame and anonymity has
grown sharper. Television, one might say, has given tangible reality to the
aura of brightness that has always seemed to surround the famous, while the
anonymous--the mere viewers of television--seem to sink into a deeper 
obscurity.<p>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC1">The
Media Beast
</a></h3>
<font size=5>I</font>N most primary states the gulf between these two Americas is immutably fixed.
Few citizens are likely to have much firsthand experience of either politicians
or the <A HREF="http://www.technometrica.com/tipp.htm">news media</A>. However, in the small states with early caucuses or
primaries, such as Iowa and New Hampshire, personal contact between the two
Americas is possible for a considerable proportion of the voters. The
encounters I saw in these states fairly crackled with tension. To begin with,
at almost every campaign stop there appeared a beast that rarely failed to
astonish the uninitiated citizen. A sort of many-footed, many-eyed,
many-tongued land octopus held together by cords and wires and jutting
electronic equipment of all descriptions, the beast was the media scrum that
instantly clusters around candidates when they move from one place to another.
At many events this ungainly clump outnumbered the citizenry, who sometimes had
a hard time getting anywhere near the candidate.<p> 
Such moments illustrated a feature of the relationship between the
participating political class and the passive voting class: the severance of
direct human contact, once thought to be the very glue of politics, between the
two worlds into which the political United States has now been sundered.<p>

<img src="Politic2.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>
Few of the voters I spoke to had any interest in the <A HREF="http://www.vote-smart.org/campaign_96/presidential/path.html#poll">poll results</A> and political
strategies that so absorbed the professional political class; on the other
hand, certain words and phrases, and what the political consultants call
"themes," were often on the voters' lips. When they said that Clinton lacked
character, or that Dole was too old, or even that there were too many negative
ads, they were repeating ideas that had been tirelessly reiterated on
television, both in interviews with voters and by analysts. Comments to the
effect that the candidates were tearing each other down too much and not
"discussing the issues" enough were almost a litany among voters. Just as each
candidate had a speech, complete with laugh lines, that he gave many times
every day, the voters seemed to have developed a kind of very short campaign
speech of their own.<p>

Sometimes in my talks with voters the reflection of the television messages was
uncannily exact. Evidently, the voters' reported disgust with the campaigns
didn't prevent the campaign messages from getting through. (This fact is, of
course, the reason for negative advertising.) How else were the voters to form
their opinions? They had no private channels of information. Were they being
brainwashed by the very techniques they despised? Had the new Leviathan
attained by propaganda the control that older, cruder Leviathans achieved by
force? <p>

Such a conclusion overlooks at least one cardinal fact that stands at the very
center of the political process today. Neither the campaigns nor the news media
are free to spin their messages out of thin air. Quite the opposite. The entire
apparatus is doggedly devoted to ascertaining and satisfying the desires of the
voters. The candidates have long since learned that the path to power is far
smoother if one gives the people what they already believe they want than if
one undertakes the arduous business of persuading them to want something else.
Instruments of the utmost refinement have been designed to detect the faintest
ripple in the public mood. No news in a campaign season is more significant
than the polls on candidates' standing with the voters. These numbers, indeed,
have been the axis on which both the campaigns and coverage of them--and even,
to an extent, the intentions of the voters themselves--have turned. First came
opinion polls. Then focus groups. Now there is "deliberative polling" (polling
done after the respondent has been given a chance to discuss an issue) and
"push polling" (a deceptive campaign technique by which a caller pretends to be
seeking opinions but is in fact covertly delivering negative information, real
or factitious, about an opposition candidate). The analysis of exit polls has
become an obsession among the professional political class. Like a team of
interns examining a patient strapped to a hospital table, the political
professionals have wired the electorate to examine every flutter and twitch of
public opinion. Examination of the public mind has become so intrusive that in
the early primaries, in which backlash against negative ads became a potent
political force, the patient was crying out for relief--to have the cardiograph
sensors removed, the intravenous tubes withdrawn. Sometimes it is said that
"the politicians" are "out of touch" with the people. If that's so, it is in
spite of relentless, assiduous, hugely expensive state-of-the-art efforts to be
<i>in</i> touch. In that sense the new Leviathan is a very accommodating
Leviathan, a very meek Leviathan, a very nice Leviathan.<p>


<h3>
<a name="RTFToC2">Hyperdemocracy
</a></h3>
<font size=5>I</font>S it possible, then, that the brainwashing is going in the opposite
direction--that the establishment, for all its wealth, fame, and seeming power,
in fact slavishly dances to the tune of popular opinion? If so, the problem is
not anti-democratic tendencies, not exploitation of the people by an arrogant
elite, but hyperdemocracy--a systematized abdication by the elite in obedience
to every passing gust of public opinion. And yet although it's undeniable that
campaign strategists and the press both are sniffing like bloodhounds for every
change in existing opinion, it's also true that opinion is formed in an
atmosphere permeated by the media. (The average American watches television for
more than four hours a day.) Once, it may have been possible for a large
popular movement to take shape in the hinterlands, unnoticed and uninfluenced
by the established powers, whom it then arose to challenge. The Populist
movement of the 1890s, regarded by many historians as an insurrection by common
<img src="Politic1.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>
people, mostly in rural areas, against the rising power of big business and big
finance, was such a movement. Today, however, the first flicker of change in
the popular mood shows up instantly on the pollsters' charts, and becomes the
subject of immediate nonstop discussion on ABC's <i>Nightline</i>, CNN's
<i>Inside Politics</i>, PBS's <i>Washington Week in Review</i>, and so forth.
Neither the news analysts nor the campaign strategists have the will or the
capacity to do anything as ambitious as engineer public opinion, and certainly
the last thing they'd want to do is to defy it. But they can and do detect
changes that are under way, and they rapidly and gigantically inflate them,
usually without meaning to. Almost any tendency that sprouts in this political
incubator is subjected, like a bacterium in a petri dish, to a forced
acceleration in growth. The day-to-day results of this process are the instant
orthodoxies, highly perishable but ubiquitous, that spring up each week and
become for their brief life the stock phrases of political discussion. Passed
swiftly from commentator to commentator, and from the commentators to the
public, they are more than mere phrases yet not quite ideas. All discourse
needs a vocabulary. The ever-changing vocabulary of American politics is born
in the loop that links voters to pollsters, poll results to television ads and
commentary, and television ads and commentary back to voters. <p>
All of that, however, leaves a large question unanswered. If "Washington"--the
class of professional political participants--seeks nothing more assiduously
than to please the voters, why do the voters feel so estranged from and
dissatisfied with Washington? Why do so many people regard politicians as
distant and indifferent autocrats, bent on thwarting or even subverting the
will of the people? Why did eyes glow when Steve Forbes spoke of the "corrupt
Washington establishment"? Why were Patrick Buchanan's legions hoarse with
enthusiasm when he promised to overthrow the "New World Order," and why have so
many polls shown that a majority of the voters wish that someone other than the
present candidates were running? The establishment (if by this term we mean
elected officials) did not descend on Washington from the planet Jupiter. Every
single member of it was sent there by the same American people who, according
to the polls, now hold most of the establishment in contempt. <p>

The complaint that politicians tailor their views to match poll results was one
I heard often, especially regarding Dole and Clinton, each an epitome of the
"inside politician" whom voters distrust so much. Yet it might seem strange
that the voters would be displeased that a politician goes to extravagant
lengths to find out what they want and to give it to them. Don't the voters
believe their own words when they say they want politicians to be in touch with
the people? One answer, certainly, is that they have learned that politicians
do not keep their promises. The unfulfilled promises of candidate George Bush
not to raise taxes and of candidate Bill Clinton to cut them are only two
notable examples. Another reason is that the voters sense that the systematic
pursuit of agreement with public opinion undermines politicians' integrity,
which can be defined as acting according to one's <i>own</i> beliefs, not those
of others--even if the others are a majority. For example, in 1992, when, in a
tour de force of public relations Clinton "repositioned" the Democrats as New
Democrats, no one doubted that the prime motive was to bring the Democratic
Party back into the "mainstream"--to where the votes are. It was "Slick
Willie's" slickest performance by far, and the voters rewarded him for it with
the presidency. Likewise, no one can doubt that in the primary season, when Bob
Dole had to take into account only Republican voters, he moved sharply to the
right, whereas after the primaries, when he faced the electorate at large, he
began to move back to the center. Nor can anyone imagine that when Clinton,
following the advice of the pollster Dick Morris, who has worked for many
Republicans, announced in his State of the Union address that "the era of big
government" was over, he was not acting politically. The candidates have
discovered that the royal road to high station is self-abasement. The public is
left in confusion and ambivalence. On the one hand, it is appreciative that the
candidates agree with it. On the other hand, it feels disgusted that these same
candidates have tailored their views to serve their ambition. The candidates
calculate that the voters will be more pleased with a popular view than
disgusted with an unprincipled performance--and so they usually have been. Yet
the voters are left longing for a person of integrity--a longing that for many
has been satisfied, however temporarily, by a Ross Perot, a Colin Powell, a
Steve Forbes, a Patrick Buchanan ("I mean what I say, and I say what I mean"), or
some other "outsider" supposedly untainted by the ways of Washington culture.
The truth appears to be that the tainted ways are not only Washington's but
America's, and they involve the voters as well as the politicians. <p>

A second reason that the voters may come to despise the representatives they
have chosen is more complex. When I asked one New Hampshire voter for his
opinion of Newt Gingrich and his revolution, he answered, "At first he
impressed the hell out of me. He promised to cut waste and balance the budget,
and I liked that. But--I don't know--I guess he oversold it. He's just lost all
credibility with me. I can't put my thumb on it, but when I look at him now, I
see a sick politician. He overshot--went right through the tube and out the
other side." In other words, Gingrich had been corrupted by the Washington
culture he supposedly sought to reform. However, another interpretation is
possible. Gingrich became speaker of the House promising, above all, to balance
the budget and to cut taxes--perhaps the two most important promises in his
Contract With America. There was nothing in the contract about cutting Medicare
and Medicaid. But when it came time to make good on the promises, it turned out
that cuts in those two programs would be necessary. Only in the land of
promises could the budget be balanced without cutting them.<p>

In one interpretation a politician has gone to Washington promising reform and
has been corrupted by the Washington culture, disappointing his supporters. In
the other interpretation the candidate has made popular promises of reform that
were either self-deluding or deceptive, and has been blocked by obdurate
realities. In the first case the fault lies with a rotten, seductive
establishment. In the second it is a folie &agrave; deux of the candidate and
the voters. And nothing, indeed, is so easy as such collusion in a system that
eagerly vacuums up the voters' every opinion, whether well or ill founded, and
then broadcasts it back to them with music in millions of dollars' worth of
thirty-second ads. The problem, then, is not that the politicians have lost
touch with voters but that both groups have lost touch with reality.<p>


<h3>
<a name="RTFToC3">Consider
Dave
</a></h3>
<font size=5>W</font>HEN reporters seek to interview voters, they naturally prefer people who are
interested in the campaign and have clear views on the issues of the day. But
the plain truth is that such people are a minority. For one thing, most people
don't vote in primaries. A typical turnout is roughly 10 percent of the
voting-age population. In the past decade almost half of eligible voters have
been staying home even in general elections. The views of these nonvoters, or
lack of such, are, for obvious reasons, underreported. Pollsters often try to
gauge how the nonvoters <i>would</i> have voted had they bothered. But the more
significant fact is precisely that they didn't vote--that they were
indifferent. Everywhere I have gone I have met these people. Our conversations
tended to be short. Again and again I heard the self-justifying refrains: "Why
bother? It makes no difference." "All the politicians are the same." "They
never do anything anyway." <p>
It's possible, of course, that these people are ravenous for more serious
discussion of the issues, as so many of those willing to give a brief interview
claim, but it's also possible that for one reason or another they simply have
not bothered to inform themselves about the campaign, and that their anger to
some extent masks ignorance. The decline of the intermediate
institutions--political parties, trade unions, civic associations, and so
forth--has dissolved many of the links that once existed between citizens and
the electoral process. But hasn't the arrival of the information age more than
made good the loss? Don't citizens now get from television or talk radio or the
Internet or any of the other proliferating media of our time the information
they once got from the precinct captain, union officials, and the like? Surveys
suggest not. It's a paradox of our time that the increase in information has
been paralleled by an increase in ignorance. We may live in an information age,
but that information, it appears, resides elsewhere than in the minds of
citizens--as if while computers were being stuffed with information, brains
were emptying. One reason, surely, is that even as information is more readily
available than ever, it is also more easily avoided. It's easier not to read a
newspaper or watch <i>Nightline</i> than it was to avoid a visit by a union
organizer or a precinct captain. It's remarkable, in fact, how easy it is in
the United States today to lead a life undisturbed by politics. I often asked
people if they were given to discussing politics. A common answer was the old
saying that they never talked about religion or politics.<p>

In a world in which both daily life and daily conversation are largely devoid
of politics, the politics that survives takes the form of a schoolroom, in
which the political professionals, in the campaigns and the media, are
purveying information that the voters are supposed to absorb. But adults are
hardly more fond of school than schoolchildren are, and these classes are
noncompulsory. Depoliticization is as simple as changing the channel from
C-SPAN to Fox5. In these circumstances, when armies of reporters push
microphones in voters' faces, they are likely to be received like teachers
asking reluctant students questions about homework they have not done. <p>

Even among those in the spectator class who choose to keep watching, there are
many in whom the pulse of interest in politics is weak. Such was the case with
a voter in New Hampshire whom I'll call Dave. He described himself as a
part-time farmer. I asked him what he thought of the candidates, and he said,
"Oh, they all say different things at different times." Then he fell silent.
Later he said of Dole, "He does have the experience. But he's too much of a
typical Washington politician. There's been some comment on his age." Of
Forbes: "He's come up with a different idea. I'll give him that. But I don't
necessarily agree with it. By the time Congress got done with it, it wouldn't
come out the way he says." Of Lamar Alexander: "He looks like a class act. He
says he's different. Whether that's good or not, I'm not so sure. And I'm not
sure how different he is."<p>

Listening to Dave, I experienced a moment of irritation. As a journalist, I am
conditioned to challenge the statements of politicians. Indeed, a readiness to
find the utterances of the powerful absurd or contemptible has become almost a
qualification for the job of journalist. The statements of voters, on the other
hand, are usually received with near reverence. And yet the fact is that in the
American system the voters, too, are powerful--they are the ultimate power in
the land, the sovereign. What good is a system in which all the subordinate
powers are rigorously held accountable but the sovereign is above criticism?
Dave was the King. Perhaps, I thought, I should lean forward aggressively and,
Sam Donaldson-like, fire "tough" questions at him. For instance: "Dave, you
said, with apparent approval, that Dole has 'experience.' But then you
complained that he is a 'Washington politician.' How could he have gotten that
experience without being a Washington politician?"<p>

Or: "If you don't agree with Forbes's one idea--and I assume you mean the flat
tax--then why should you care that in the event that Forbes becomes President,
Congress might gut it? You should be glad."<p>

Or: "Well, Dave, is Alexander different or not? You're going to be deciding in
a few days whether he's the Republican nominee for President of the United
States. Don't you think you should know by now? You're the King. Don't you
think you should take your responsibilities a little more seriously?"<p>

In fact I engaged in no such ill-mannered inquisition of Dave, who had been
kind enough to let me, a stranger, intrude on his breakfast. The mind of Dave
was the target of all the high-powered manipulations I had seen in the media
and on the campaign trail. The polling and the push polling, the focus groups,
the exit polling, the negative ads and the positive ads, the satellite feeds,
the discussion programs, the sound bites on the news programs, were all aimed
at either fathoming or directing the vague trend of his thoughts, in the hope
that some current taking shape there and in the thoughts of others like him
would furnish a glide path to power. <p>

"The voters are not fools," the renowned scholar of elections V. O. Key wrote
in <i>The Responsible Electorate</i> (1966). But whether stupid or smart, they
have become by the mid-1990s more strangers to the political system than
participants in it. Isn't there something grotesquely unbalanced, even
farcical, about a system in which tens of thousands of highly paid, highly
trained, hyperactive, technically overequipped professional courtiers are
trying with all the vast means of modern communications to provoke a response
from a sovereign who is at best half asleep with boredom and at worst turned
wholly away in an angry sulk?<p>


<h3>
<a name="RTFToC4">The
Test of Reality
</a></h3>
<font size=5>I</font>N civics texts American democracy renews itself according to something like
the following procedure: As time passes, the nation experiences new problems.
Candidates for public office ponder the problems and propose legislative plans
to deal with them. Because political philosophies and analyses of the problems
differ, the public is presented with a number of alternative programs. Then the
public goes to the polls, chooses the candidates it thinks best, and sends them
to Washington. Now they are the people's representatives. Therefore, when they
enact the programs they have proposed, the people are ready to pay whatever
costs are involved--in taxes, for example, or even, in the case of war, in
lives. That is what it means to confer a popular mandate. Then comes the test
of reality. Either the plans solve the problems or they do not. If they do, the
representatives may well be re-elected; if not, they are likely to lose their
offices, and new representatives, proposing different programs, will be 
elected.<p>

It's perfectly obvious that in recent years the political system has not
operated according to this procedure. New problems have arisen, as always, but
now the candidates, instead of pondering them and asking what needs to be done
to solve them, are likely to read polling data to discover what the people
would like to see done. Yet most people probably have not thought deeply about
the problems, and their answers are likely to reflect casual wishes instead of
serious proposals. When the wishes are granted, they bring unwanted
consequences.<p>

The long story of the budget deficit offers the best example. Polls have for
many years shown that the public wishes to balance the budget but does not wish
to pay more taxes or endure steep cuts in government spending. In the realm of
reality it's not possible to balance the budget without raising taxes or
cutting spending. However, modern campaigns have at their disposal a richly
variegated, compelling alternative to reality: the pseudo-reality of
television, in which the feat can be accomplished several times a day. Like
Reagan in 1980 and 1984, candidates can say that military spending can be
raised, taxes cut, and the budget balanced all at the same time. Like Bush in
1988, they can champion a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution but
add, "Read my lips: no new taxes." Like Clinton in 1992, they can promise to
cut the budget but also promise a tax cut to the "forgotten middle class." Like
Gingrich in 1994, they can again promise to balance the budget and cut the
capital-gains tax and other taxes but without mentioning any need for deep cuts
in popular programs. That these formulas, all promising benefits while
concealing inevitable costs, have proved politically popular is hardly
surprising. Everyone is content for a moment, yet the stage has been set for
fiasco. Reality, though unconsulted, nevertheless imposes its price, and the
bill has to be presented. Then a startled public feels either betrayed (as it
did when Bush broke his no-taxes pledge and when Clinton failed to deliver the
tax cut he had promised) or aggrieved (as it did when Gingrich revealed the
spending cuts that would pay for his balanced budget and tax cuts). Either way,
faith in the political process is undermined, and paralysis is the result. The
public reacts angrily--a fact immediately registered by the polls and the
media--and quickly steps in to punish the betrayer, as it did Clinton by
turning both houses of Congress over to the Republicans in 1994, and as it did
Gingrich when, reacting even more promptly, it stopped the hated legislation
from being passed.<p>

Hence, whereas in the civics texts representatives are at least given a chance
to carry out what they have promised to do in the election, and then are judged
by the results, action today is short-circuited before it can be tried, and the
test of reality never comes at all. Technically, the system appears to be in
working order. Candidates are running, voters are voting, representatives are
being sent to Washington. No one seems to interfere at any point. And yet no
mandate is produced, and usually no legislation either. The government--if not
actually shut down, as it was this winter--is paralyzed.<p>

Paralysis, of course, breeds disillusionment with "Washington" and "the
politicians." The politicians have been sent to Washington to solve problems.
Why don't they do so? Why don't they put their heads under the hood of the car,
as Ross Perot said he would do, and fix the engine? And why vote if the
politicians never do anything? The conclusion the voters draw is that at the
center of a sound and healthy country the Washington culture must somehow have
grown corrupt, as Steve Forbes said. Or perhaps the government has forgotten
its responsibility to the people of the United States, as Buchanan says, and
now serves an unaccountable New World Order that he would bring "crashing down"
the day he took office. Instead of being the people's instrument for the
solution of their problems, the government appears to be the problem. <p>

Thus arises the whole pathos of the "outsider." The problem, it now appears, is
a group of "insiders," and the solution is one outsider or another. But where
is it that the outsiders wish to go if they are chosen? To that same corrupt
Washington, where there is every likelihood that they will become insiders, and
need replacing in turn. The Populists of the 1890s believed that the
representatives in Washington had been taken over by powerful economic
interests--the Money Power. They did not imagine that the people's
representatives had gratuitously and independently subverted the purposes of
democratic government--that the elected representatives all by themselves were
the source of corruption. This belief was reserved for our time. It is the
premise, for example, of one of the favorite tenets of the outsider faith: term
limits. The belief that there is a need for a means other than elections for
throwing the scoundrels out contains an implicit denial that it was the country
at large that sent the scoundrels to Washington in the first place. The voters
who attribute all the country's ills to the government in fact pay that
institution an unintended compliment. They attribute to Washington ills that
are in fact mostly created by history--by the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
rise of the global economy, the arrival of the information age, the fraying of
the natural environment. <p>

To the extent that the electorate is in the grip of these ideas, it is not
surprising that voters' behavior veers wildly. It is tempting to see the shifts
of the nineties as a speeded-up version of a normal seesawing between right and
left. A better metaphor, however, would be a pendulum with a wrecking ball at
the end. For each time the public tries something out--now swinging right, now
left--and is disillusioned, another piece of its confidence in politics as a
whole is knocked down. In this atmosphere only negative enthusiasm remains
possible. It's small wonder, then, that campaigns should revolve around
negative ads, for the public can agree only on what it dislikes, not on what it
likes or wants to see done. Nor should the fact that negative ads were so
unpopular early in the campaign season be seen as very encouraging. From time
to time a candidate will try to fuel his campaign with attacks on negative ads.
But in politics, if not in math, the negative of a negative is not a
positive--it's another negative. In fact, the unpopularity of negative ads only
announces a deeper vacuum. <p>


<h3>
<a name="RTFToC5">Supply-side
Politics
</a></h3>
 <font size=5>"A</font>S our case is new, so we must think anew and act 	anew," Abraham Lincoln
said. Today our case is 		again new, but our thoughts are stale. We have
lost the very framework in which political life in the Cold War years unfolded,
but scant effort is being made to fashion another. The principal reason, it
would appear, is that the electoral system, instead of offering new ideas
suitable to the time, devotes the amazing new instruments of the information
age to discovering what the public already believes and offering that. And even
these offers are not honest, because only their benefits and not their costs
are advertised at election time. The procedure is a formula for stagnation. In
times when change is modest and slow (if such times can still be imagined), the
disadvantages of the system are perhaps not great. But when, as at present,
change is swift, deep, and fundamental, the gap between political practice and
the world becomes dangerously wide. Then events race out ahead of thought and
word, which stumble blindly behind in a world they cannot apprehend.<p>
 
The public as a whole can be expected to feel the need for profound renewal but
not to be the creator of the ideas that will build the new framework. Dave, for
one, seems unlikely to come up with the necessary ideas, but democracy depends
on the conviction that he is the best judge of ideas that others bring forward.
The job of proposing at these times has always been the work of a
minority--whether elite, as at the Constitutional Convention or in government
councils at the onset of the Cold War, or popular, as in the civil-rights
movement of the 1960s--while the job of disposing has been the work of all. <p>

Supply-side economics proposed the idea that the strength of the economy
depends as much on the vitality of what is created by business and offered to
the consumer as it does on the consumer's demand. Whether or not the theory was
sound as economics, it appears that we now need what could be called
supply-side politics. Supply-side politics would pay more attention to offering
ideas of adequate strength and vitality to the public than to discovering what
the public already believes it wants. Now a whole new framework for political
life is needed. A framework can be built only by imagination and perseverance.
It requires looking less at focus groups and exit polls and more at the
nation's and the world's problems. Above all, it requires that individuals,
political parties, and public institutions develop the fortitude to hold fast
to new convictions, even in the face of initial unpopularity and rejection. If
no serious proposals are put forward, the voters' choices lose their meaning,
and public opinion turns to mush.<p>

The calm that has descended on 1996 as the election approaches should not be
mistaken for the calm of contentment and stability. The public's inchoate but
well-justified hunger for a new politics to fit the new age goes unfulfilled.
The fact that frustration and anger have found no adequate voice does not mean
that they have evaporated. The old parties and their associated ideas are built
on a foundation that history has swept away. The voters, disappointed and
resigned, have settled for the known faces, the known ideas. It's hard to
believe that they will settle for them for long.

<blockquote>

	<i><font size=4>Why is Congress held in such low

esteem? One reason is that as it has become more truly representative, it has

tried to solve more and more problems, including many that no one knows how to

solve--thus raising expectations and frequently disappointing them. Quick-fix

reforms aren't likely to make the public any happier with the legislative

branch</i></font><p>

	

	

	<pre>

	

	</pre>

	

	<font size=5>S</font>uppose you were an idiot," Mark Twain wrote during the Gilded Age. "And

suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself." "Do you pray for

the senators?" someone asked the chaplain of the Senate in 1903. "No, I look at

the senators and pray for the country," he replied.<p>



<p>



The more things change, the more they remain the same. The 104th Congress began

work in January, and talk of institutional revolution is once again in the air.

It's not just that the Republicans--finally in control of both Houses for the

first time in four decades--have begun reforming the least popular branch by

taking such measures as applying all federal employment laws to Congress,

cutting House committee staffs by a third, and requiring a 60 percent majority

in the House to approve tax increases. Many critics, such as Kevin Phillips and

Lamar Alexander, have discussed a number of rather radical proposals for

recasting the institution--everything from term limits to increasing the size

of Congress to cutting the length of the session in half to instituting

national referenda.<p>



<p>



One might argue that some of these changes would make Congress more effective,

as would a few of the currently popular (but unlikely to pass) proposals for

campaign-finance overhaul and restrictions on lobbying. <p>



<p>



A number of scholars, former members of Congress, and other observers suggest,

however, that even far-reaching reforms--not to mention the recent election

results--are unlikely to quell the public's considerable discontent with

Congress for long. In its attempts to lay the blame for that discontent at the

feet of the Democrats, the new Republican majority is ignoring a fundamental

reality that has come into being over the past generation: owing largely to the

changing nature of representation, the expanding role of the federal

government, and the influence of television, the public has arrived at new and

often contradictory expectations of how Congress should act and what it should

do. Until these contradictions are resolved, Congress is doomed to unpopularity

and ineffectiveness, no matter who controls it.<p>



<p>



There is, after all, an inevitable tension in any legislative system between

deliberation and action, discretion and responsiveness. The job of a

legislature is not only to get things done but also to air points of view and

ensure the legitimacy of governmental action. These goals often conflict--as do

the objectives of representing a constituency while exercising independent

judgment, or looking out for both the national and the local interest.

Throughout American history the pendulum has swung back and forth as

legislators have tried to come to terms with these tensions. Today, however,

voters apparently believe that the pendulum can be made to stop. In much the

same way as the public seems to want a welfare state without picking up the

tab, it wants the advantages of a legislative system without any of the

costs.<p>



<p>



Even if Congress adopts all the most ambitious reforms, this cannot be

achieved. No matter how noble the goal, virtually any reform that seeks to

change the makeup of Congress (such as term limits) or encourage debate or make

members rely less on staff, so that they will draft their own bills and read

those of others, will lead the institution to be even more dependent on special

interests or to get less done. Almost any proposal that increases the

institution's ability to act quickly, such as eliminating the filibuster or

making it easier to "fast track" legislation, will tend to alienate those in

the minority and cause some attempts at lawmaking to be less judicious and

acceptable to the masses. Attempts to limit the length of the session will

inevitably narrow the range of concerns that Congress can tackle. Although many

of the current Republican proposals for institutional reform have surface

appeal, chances are that they will eventually end up antagonizing at least as

many voters as they please. And Congress will end up just as unpopular as it

was when the Republicans took over, if not more so. <p>



<p>



<p>



The Wired Congress<p>



<p>



For the first four decades of the Republic, congressmen actually spent very

little time in Washington. For the next century or so they had little contact

with their districts once they were in Washington. (Senators, of course, were

not even popularly elected until early in this century.) Theorists from Thomas

Hobbes to Edmund Burke had debated the extent to which representatives should

directly reflect the desires of their constituents, but that debate took place

in a world in which a lot of groups couldn't vote, news was hard to come by,

and no one really knew how to measure public opinion other than in an election.

The difficulty of travel and the irregularity of mail delivery made

communication between constituents and Congress problematic. Thus members

inevitably had to exercise independent judgment on most issues, no matter where

they stood philosophically on the representation question.<p>



<p>



Today things have swung to the opposite extreme, and not just because the

infamous lobbyists surround congressmen and senators. Daily polling, E-mail,

800 numbers, and call-in shows have exponentially increased the contact that

representatives have with their constituents. "Many days I felt like nothing

more than the end of a computer terminal," Elliott Levitas, a former

representative from Georgia, told me in an interview. The danger today is not

that representatives know too little about what the electorate feels but that

they know too much. Like body temperature, public opinion can shift hourly

without consequence. "The cooling-off process that used to exist isn't there

any more," Dennis Eckart, a former representative from Ohio, says. "As a lover

of democracy, I can appreciate that, but there was an advantage to having an

electorate that couldn't figure out what was in a tax bill." What's more, polls

are often misleading--in part because they can be manipulated, and in part

because many issues are so complex that the public holds conflicting views of

what it wants, and expects its representatives magically to resolve the

conflict.<p>



<p>



"Ultimately, there's very little clarity to all those poll numbers, even though

a lot of analysts attach great significance to them," says Peter Smith,

formerly a representative from Vermont and now the founding president of

California State University at Monterey Bay. "Health care and welfare reform

are abstractions, no matter what a poll says. People favor something in

general. When you get down to specifics, however, they often don't." The debate

last session over President Bill Clinton's health-care bill illustrated that

principle once again.<p>



<p>



The rise of constituency politics has also led the public to view legislators

simply as instruments of its will. The political scientist David Mayhew, of

Yale University, is not alone in having observed that the job of a federal

legislator changed dramatically with the rise of New Deal and Great Society

programs. Now an increasing number of constituents look to their legislator not

only to obtain valuable pork-barrel projects for their state or district but

also to help them obtain personal benefits from the government and its

bureaucracies.<p>



<p>



This development has been exacerbated by the fact that representatives have to

serve more constituents today than they did in the past. Sixty-five

representatives served four million Americans in the first Congress--a ratio of

approximately 1:60,000. Today, with 435 representatives serving a population of

more than 260 million, the ratio is approximately 1:600,000. Offices in home

states have proliferated, and legislative aides have increasingly been

transformed into caseworkers, thereby accounting for a healthy proportion of

the increase in the size of those vilified congressional staffs. (The

Republican reforms haven't even touched House and Senate personal-staff

members, almost 40 percent of whom now work in district or state offices.) It

should be no surprise, then, that voters increasingly view their legislators

almost as personal therapists--a perspective that hardly encourages

representatives to show any independence from the will of their districts, or

to act in the national interest when it conflicts with local concerns. If

legislators now seem excessively parochial and preoccupied with day-to-day

responsiveness, that is what they are hearing the public demand.<p>



<p>



While these changes have been occurring, Congress has also been attracting

members of a different kind, whether Republican or Democrat. Virtually everyone

agrees that today's representatives tend to be far better educated and

informed, more professional, and less graft-ridden than their predecessors. Yet

many also believe that something is missing from this generation in

Congress--even from the new Republicans. "What happened is that as the quality

of the legislature went up, its performance went down," says Theodore Lowi, a

professor of government at Cornell University. "These people are much more

individual entrepreneurs; they have far less respect for party institutions and

hierarchy." Or, as the former representative Al Swift, of Washington, puts it,

"We'd be better off with four hundred and ten followers and twenty-five leaders

than the other way around."<p>



<p>



The new entrepreneurial style is blamed in part for the lack of collegiality in

Congress and the proliferation of committee and subcommittee assignments on the

Hill, which have increased for senators and nearly doubled for representatives

since the 1950s. (The number of committees and subcommittees has actually

shrunk, owing to reorganizations; the Republican Contract With America has

consolidated even more committees.) It also helps account, Lowi says, for the

fact that Congress has become so sensitive to short-term public opinion: "They

don't have the party to hide behind anymore. Because they're more individually

accountable, they feel much more vulnerable and they react accordingly." <p>



<p>



<p>



Circular Cures<p>



<p>



Reversing the trend toward a professional class of legislators is the goal of

the term-limits movement. Mark Petracca, a political scientist at the

University of California at Irvine, has written that legislative

professionalization runs counter to the basic values of representative

government, because "a profession entails a set of role relationships between

'experts' and 'clients'" which are fundamentally at odds with the way Congress

is supposed to work. Yet the desire for a "citizen legislature," embodied in

the term-limits movement, may be as quixotic as the search for a doctor who

still makes house calls. "Sure, Congress has changed, but so has the country,"

says Ronald Peters, the director of the Carl Albert Congressional Research and

Studies Center, at the University of Oklahoma. "Things have become less

hierarchical than they once were almost everywhere. Part of this is

generational, but a lot of it is just the way we've changed as a people.

Legislators are more autonomous, but so is everyone else in the culture. This

institution may be more professional, but all disciplines are becoming more

professionalized. This is all part of a larger pattern, which in one sense

couldn't be more representative."<p>



<p>



The current cultural preoccupation with inclusion has also had important

effects. Opening up the process to everyone--by such means as expansion of

voting rights, more primaries and referenda, and encouraging access to

government services--could be characterized as the major theme of our politics

over the past third of a century, and there's obviously a lot to be said for

it. The congressional response to Watergate, for example, often focused on the

process of government, not its substance: lawmakers passed "sunshine laws" to

force government to be more open and ethical, and in a spasm of reform wiped

out many seniority privileges to make Congress more egalitarian. Even today,

when complaints about Congress focus on how process reforms have still failed

to address the institution's underlying problems, many of the popular ideas

about how to change Congress--such as term limits and more referenda--continue

to focus on process. The problems caused by being more democratic and

process-oriented, both Republicans and Democrats seem to be saying, can be

solved by being even more democratic and process-oriented.<p>



<p>



The more a system values giving everyone a voice, however, the less it can

value speed and effectiveness. All those voices have to be heard, and

frequently they have to be accommodated. The correlate of enabling more women

and members of minorities to be part of the legislature--a laudable goal--is

that their concerns must be addressed, even though some of these concerns have

traditionally been ignored by most legislatures. Irwin Gertzog, in his book

Congressional Women, finds that women in Congress are far likelier than their

male colleagues to stress such issues as the treatment of rape victims, the

problems of displaced homemakers, and funding for diagnostic tests for breast

cancer. "Congress succeeds much better as a representative body than it used

to," says Michael Mezey, a professor of political science at DePaul University,

"which means it's probably somewhat less successful as a lawmaking body." <p>



<p>



Democratizing the internal rules of Congress has also made it harder to

accomplish anything substantive. The more a culture moves toward democracy,

however, the more it empowers those forces that have the ability to manipulate

public opinion or provide access. The rise in the importance of media

consultants, the press, and special-interest money is directly proportional to

the growth of democracy in the culture and in Congress over the past thirty

years. Read the polls or listen to talk radio and you will find that the

complaints today are as much about these new forces and what they have done to

the process as about anything else. The urge to destroy elites has simply

created another class of them; the solution has become the problem. And the

Republicans are doing next to nothing to stop that.<p>



<p>



<p>



The Buck Stops Nowhere<p>



<p>



Congress once tended to pass relatively concrete, simple laws in relatively few

areas, which meant that the results of any lawmaking were far easier to assess.

For our first 140 years it dealt with economic issues primarily through tariffs

and focused on the country's expansion, wars, and treaties. There was little

money to spend, and the Constitution had been interpreted as allowing far less

federal intrusion into the workings of the states than we know today. <p>



<p>



"Nineteenth-century Congresses actually worked better," Theodore Lowi says.

"They just passed very limited, piecemeal laws." At the turn of the century the

House had no staff members and the Senate only a few. (By 1991 the personal

staffs of the two houses together numbered more than 11,000, and nearly another

3,500 people worked for the committees.)<p>



<p>



The passage of a federal income tax early in this century was the first step

toward the creation of the welfare state. Still, the concept of dealing with

complicated economic and social-welfare problems on a systematic national basis

really arose during the crisis presented by the Great Depression and then the

Second World War. Congress's response in the 1930s and the three decades that

followed was to cede to the executive branch (which had drafted most of the

laws in the first place) the authority to solve most of these problems--and the

creation of administrative agencies, along with the enlargement of

administrators' responsibilities, was often part of the solution. The idea was

that many problems were too complex or technical for a legislature and that a

specialized agency such as the Federal Communications Commission, or an

administrator such as the Secretary of Agriculture, could do a better job of

solving them. These agencies were also created in an era when there was much

intellectual support for the notion that decisions should be taken away from

legislatures and given to experts, who knew better.<p>



<p>



The typical congressional grant of authority to do this was quite brief,

simple, and vague: "[to regulate] interstate and foreign commerce in

communication by wire and radio"; to make agricultural marketing "orderly." In

theory, Congress would strictly oversee the agency's performance. In reality,

representatives were usually happy to pass the buck to someone else and leave

the agency alone, except when they needed a favor. As it happened, legislators

soon discovered that such a setup also allowed them to claim credit for a

program and then, if things went awry, "run against the bureaucracy"--a

bureaucracy they had created, to avoid having to deal with problems themselves.

The buck stopped nowhere.<p>



<p>



The Supreme Court put a stop to elements of Roosevelt's New Deal, on the

grounds that the Constitution simply did not allow the federal government to

act in many areas. Support for a further expansion of federal power, however,

took hold in the public imagination in the 1950s and 1960s, with the

civil-rights revolution, which ended up discrediting intellectual and legal

arguments about "states' rights." Nelson Polsby, an expert on Congress and a

professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley,

says, "It became an article of faith among liberals that you can't trust

Mississippi, so you have to nationalize these things."<p>



<p>

For Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs, in the mid-sixties, Congress was

still using the New Deal agency as a model--with important differences. First,

the traditional division between federal and state authority having been

obliterated, Congress began moving into substantive areas, such as crime and

housing, that had traditionally been beyond the purview of the federal

government except in extreme emergencies. The early civil-rights laws were

working, after all, and many of the nation's problems seemed rooted in its

troubled racial past; a federal takeover seemed justified. Once involved in

those areas, however, Congress kept expanding its grasp, eventually dictating

to states on traditionally local questions--speed limits, for example. The

result is that today Congress routinely passes laws dealing with local

matters--crime, homelessness, education--and nobody even blinks at the loss of

local control, which was once a cornerstone of our Jeffersonian public

philosophy. As the former representative Al Swift puts it, "We've kind of

blurred the distinction between a county sheriff and a congressman."<p>



<p>



That's a recent and radical turn in our history, and one--"devolution" rhetoric

to the contrary--that the Republicans show little sign of undoing. It is not

simply that Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich may be misreading last year's

election returns when he maintains that the public agrees it is time to

dismantle much of the Great Society, or return programs to the states. The

Contract With America, for example, promised a tougher anti-crime package,

"strengthening rights of parents in their children's education," stronger

child-pornography laws, and new rules to reform the welfare system, tort law,

and product liability--efforts in many areas beyond what was seen as the

purview of Congress when the Republicans last held both houses.<p>



<p>



The 1960s blizzard of legislation came during an era when belief in the

possibilities of governmental power may have been at a peak. In the 1965--1966

session alone nearly 20,000 bills were introduced. (The number in recent years

has averaged fewer than 10,000 a session.) "If we can put a man on the moon, we

can [fill in the blank]" seemed to characterize almost every politician's stump

speech. Every problem, it seemed, had an effective legislative solution. Alan

Ehrenhalt, the author of The United States of Ambition, finds that legislators

of both parties still hold this belief. "Legislators are used to solving

problems," he says. "Government tends to attract people who think government

can solve problems. But once you get into things like crime, welfare, and

education, you're trying to change human behavior, and that's much tougher to

do. The New Deal was small potatoes compared to most of this stuff."<p>



<p>



"Several things happen when the government gets into these areas," says James

Q. Wilson, a professor of management and public policy at the University of

California at Los Angeles. "First, no one really knows how to solve these

problems. Second, the public itself is deeply conflicted about most of these

issues; you rarely have a consensus from which to act. Third, these issues tend

to be so complex that they overwhelm the process. And finally, when these

measures fail to do much to solve something like crime--which is what

inevitably happens--they greatly reinforce the general disillusionment with

government. There's something to be said for sticking with what you know how to

do."<p>



<p>



During that legislative blizzard Congress was no longer just distributing money

or dealing with problems in discrete areas (how to regulate the airwaves, or

how to provide a supplemental income to senior citizens), and the grand

problems it confronted, like poverty and crime, seemed to require a variety of

coordinated strategies. "That was a key mistake," Theodore Lowi says. "Health

and welfare are not holistic things; they're a collection of problems. The

bills collapse of their own weight." Such bills also tend to be so elaborate

that voters have difficulty understanding them--which means, at a minimum, that

opponents have an easy time raising fears about them. Unsurprisingly, the

public becomes more engaged when Congress is debating a seemingly

straightforward issue like the Gulf War, in which voters can understand what is

at stake.<p>



<p>



Nonetheless, over time congressmen on both sides of the aisle began drafting

longer, more comprehensive bills; the number of pages of law entered into the

statute books during the relatively uneventful 1991--1992 session was two and a

half times the number entered by the 1965--1966 Great Society Congress. With

many legislators continually preoccupied by issues of openness and equal

availability of services, access and due process became legislative focuses.

That translated into greatly increased complexity and bureaucracy, not to

mention a drain on the courts as litigants attempted to enforce their new

rights. In 1936 there were 2,355 pages of regulations amplifying federal laws

published in the Federal Register. By 1969 the number had risen to 20,464

pages; in the 1990s the register has been averaging about 60,000 pages a year.

<p>



<p>



No Amendments Wanted<p>



<p>



Trying to solve a national megaproblem with one huge bill is still an American

obsession, as the recent health-care debate showed. Still, by the late 1960s

the old model of legislating had begun to fall out of favor, at least in one

respect. The criticism, advanced by Ralph Nader and others, was that

administrative agencies such as the Interstate Commerce Commission and the

Federal Communications Commission inevitably became controlled by the forces

they were supposed to regulate. Moreover, distrust of authority was expanding

along with voting rights, and there was a corresponding lack of trust in the

opinions of experts vis-a-vis "the people." As David Schoenbrod, a professor at

New York Law School, has related in Power Without Responsibility (1993), what

followed was a series of congressional statutes (beginning with the Clean Air

Act, in 1970), passed with bipartisan support, that started to abandon the

concept of open-ended delegation to independent agencies. Instead these laws

essentially ordered the agency in question to take action and gave "elaborate

instructions about the goals that it should achieve and the procedures for

promulgating them." These instructions often placed administrative obligations

on the states, while Congress took credit for the benefits of the legislation.

As a result of this legislative model statutes not only became lengthier and

more complicated but also began running up hidden costs, while parochial and

elite interests inevitably asserted their influence with help from both sides

of the aisle: it was Alaska's Republican senator Ted Stevens, after all, who

got grant money for Alaska to try to convert the aurora borealis into

electricity. (As Congress-watchers point out, by the past session Congress was

appropriating money for a University of Georgia study of city pests, ordering

the Department of Health and Human Services to hire "six medium sedans" for

transport, and adding what amounted to a gang-rehabilitation program to a

flood-relief bill.) And over time Congress confronted many scientific or

technical questions--such as how to clean the air--that were far beyond the

expertise of most congressmen. So legislators of both parties hired more staff

members to deal with these questions, and stopped reading much of their own

legislation. Because members needed to rely on experts to draft these extensive

and specific statutes, they also became increasingly reliant on "special

interests"--if not to write the bills, then at least to tell them what the

bills said before a vote. Cutting committee staff, as the Republicans have

done, will hardly solve this problem, particularly for newer members, who tend

to know less about technical problems than their more experienced colleagues.<p>



<p>



The effect of an interstate-highway-building program or a Voting Rights

Act--two legislative success stories from the 1950s and 1960s--can be assessed

fairly easily. But, as Bruce Ackerman and Susan Rose-Ackerman, professors at

Yale Law School, ask in The Uncertain Search for Environmental Quality, how

does a deliberative body measure precisely the relationship between clean water

and public health, let alone determine whether clean water could be had more

cheaply by another method? What's more, even if a given approach makes sense

now, things change over time. Once a bill gains a constituency--and all those

that are enacted do, if only for economic reasons--it becomes very difficult to

shift course. <p>



<p>



The result has been a proliferation of vague or increasingly unworkable laws

that judges cannot revise under current theories of statutory interpretation.

(The same is not true of the common law.) These laws can also bankrupt the

country, as the laws become ever more complex and costs mount. The Clean Air

Act of 1970, complex as it was, filled forty-seven pages in the United States

Code. The revision twenty years later filled more than 200 in the denser

Congressional Record.<p>



<p>



Having so many more constituents and areas of responsibility than it had in the

past has also stymied Congress and shifted the way it operates. Besides

muscling its way into areas once left to the states, Congress has spent an

increasing amount of time over the past two decades on budgetary matters: the

number of roll calls on budget questions in the House was almost six times as

great in 1991 as it was in 1955--yet another trend that seems unlikely to

change with Republican control. "The change in work load has affected the way

Congress acts, which in turn has affected public perceptions," says Bruce I.

Oppenheimer, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, who

studies Congress. "In a time-constrained environment the opposition gains

power. The filibuster wasn't used much before 1970, because it wasn't a very

effective weapon. Who cared if you wasted time? Congress never ran out of

time." In a legislative world where time is scarce, democratic values also tend

to collapse and mistakes to become more common. One of the purposes of

deliberation, after all, is to achieve consensus and avoid error. Tellingly,

bills for many of the major legislative achievements of the past sixty years,

though contentious, ended up passing with large majorities. For example, the

Social Security Act passed in 1935 with seventy-seven votes in the Senate; the

Civil Rights Act in 1964 won seventy-three.<p>



<p>



Yet one of the distinguishing characteristics of recent sessions, particularly

in the House, is that what little deliberation did once occur has been

virtually eliminated. That, in turn, has increased partisanship. In recent

years a bill has had about half the chance of passage that it had fifty years

ago. In part to speed things up--which is, after all, what the public says it

wants--bills introduced on the floor increasingly restrict amendments. Although

the Republicans have promised to address that, so far there has been no

significant change. Debates now typically take place with no one listening in

the chamber, as anyone who has ever watched C-SPAN knows. Even the much-praised

Senate and House exchanges before passage of the Gulf War resolution, in

January of 1991, consisted primarily of members' rising to deliver prepared

speeches to a body in which virtually every mind was already made up. And this

year? The Republicans have added many new wrinkles to Congress, but careful

deliberation does not appear to be among them.<p>



<p>



<p>



The Camera and Congress<p>



<p>



A different kind of congressional persona tends to flourish in the television

age. Fifteen years ago Michael J. Robinson, a professor at Catholic University,

wrote, "The increasingly greater reliance on the media for nomination,

election, status in the Congress, and reelection is one sign of a new

congressional character--one more dynamic, egocentric, immoderate, and,

perhaps, intemperate." These telegenic figures, according to one source

Robinson cited, were often more concerned with getting on television than with

legislative mechanics--yet another reason for the lack of consensus, the

emphasis on the illusion of results, and the expansion of staff to deal with

the institution's real missions.<p>



<p>



Because of its inherent biases, television has also subtly altered the way the

public perceives Congress. C-SPAN, of course, has opened up the daily workings

of Congress, but its effect is quite limited. C-SPAN's typical audience is

minuscule compared with the audience that receives news about Congress from the

major networks--which have greatly influenced the way print sources cover

Congress.<p>



<p>



The communications theorist Ernest Bormann once wrote that "television news

coverage is, in many respects, an exercise in creative dramatics in which a

cast of familiar characters assembles . . . and improvises a drama according to

a stock scenario depending on the news event." By now the scenario involving

Congress is very familiar. Because television is drawn to strong characters, it

elevates the importance of the President and the speaker of the House vis-a-vis

the institution of Congress. Because the medium is drawn to conflict, it

denigrates the value of compromise, upon which legislatures depend, and plays

up scandal or contentiousness. A recent study by S. Robert Lichter and Daniel

R. Amundson, of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, has found that from

1972 to 1992 the proportion of network news stories concerning ethical lapses

in Congress more than quadrupled, and the proportion of those portraying

conflict between members nearly tripled from 1987 to 1992 (though, to be fair,

conflict is up). Television is wedded to the dramatic gesture, and legislative

bodies when legislating rarely act in a theatrical fashion. What's more, the

legislative process is often messy and difficult; its lack of clear lines and

packaging violates the whole spirit of scripted entertainment that has come to

dominate the culture. The workings of Congress are complex and thus

time-consuming to explain, and time is something that network television

apparently cannot afford. <p>



<p>



Changing the voters as much as the candidates, television creates a passive

audience of viewer-voters who demand instant gratification and no loose ends.

In a world where advertisers constantly proclaim, "You can have it all!" and

"Just Do It!" voters have come to see government institutions as ones that

should provide it all and just do it, Ross Perot--style. Commercial television

also offers an implicit vision of the world in which it's not community or

belief in an abiding principle that offers happiness but the acquisition of

goods. No wonder, then, that as television became pervasive and the postwar

consumer culture took root, voters came increasingly to view the purpose of

Congress--if not of government--as guaranteeing their right to that happiness.

<p>



<p>



With Congress thus increasingly frustrated in its primary responsibility to

develop and pass good laws, its members have turned to other tasks, many of

them nurtured by television. Here, too, the Republicans have been no different

from the Democrats. The memorable moments of the past three decades in Congress

have naturally tended to come in front of the cameras--from the McCarthy

hearings to Watergate to the Anita Hill--Clarence Thomas confrontation.

Congress has been conducting investigations since the 1790s. Yet it is

undeniable that congressional investigations have flourished in the television

age, thereby appropriating more of Congress's time and attention. Unlike the

typical lawmaking process, these hearings offer the broadcast media drama and

compelling characters in a stately scene. And, as Daniel Boorstin pointed out

nearly thirty-five years ago, in his book The Image, the real purpose of

hearings is often difficult to discern. "In many cases," Boorstin wrote, "these

committees have virtually no legislative impulse, and sometimes no intelligible

legislative assignment." <p>



<p>



And there is the confirmation process--another area that consumes increasing

amounts of the Senate's energy, if only because the number of posts that

require confirmation has risen from 149 to 310 since 1960. Confirmation fights

are also part of our history, but dramatic confirmation hearings are mostly a

media-age phenomenon. Here, too, the consensus is that the cameras have

contorted the process into great TV drama but something of a well-documented

travesty. In foreign policy, a stage that Presidents have long dominated,

Congress has tried to share the television spotlight in recent decades, with

the same mixed results and a commensurate loss of time to spend in other areas.

In War and Responsibility (1993) the Stanford University law professor John

Hart Ely argues that while Congress has appeared to try to take more

responsibility for military action in recent decades, it has in fact happily

abdicated to the President most of its powers in this area. This has allowed

many members to claim credit when military ventures go well, but to hold

accusatory hearings and press conferences before the cameras when they don't.<p>



<p>



Congressional actions in the television age have thus come to join the category

that Boorstin called "pseudo-events"--in which the illusion of results becomes

far more significant in the culture than the results themselves. In legislative

hearings that don't really look at legislation, in crime bills that almost

everyone privately admits will do next to nothing to reduce crime, the

appearance and the drama of the action overshadow the importance of the action

itself. Pseudo-events, Boorstin said, are usually more interesting than real

actions, and they therefore seem more compelling and often more real. He wrote,

Once we have tasted the charm of pseudo- events, we are tempted to believe they

are the only important events. . . . And the poison tastes so sweet that it

spoils our appetite for plain fact. Our seeming ability to satisfy our

exaggerated expectations makes us forget that they are exaggerated.<p>



<p>



<p>



Tainted Prescriptions<p>



<p>



In the end it is always easy to romanticize the past, just as it is tempting to

exaggerate how much a shift in control will change Congress. A fifty-two-seat

shift in the House is unusual in modern times, but it may mean only that the

country is returning to the electoral patterns of a century ago, when party

control of Congress often shifted back and forth by large margins, while the

body drew its share of criticism. "There was no golden age of legislation,"

says the Yale political scientist David Mayhew. <p>



<p>



Agreement is almost universal that Congress could take a number of steps both

to purge itself of the effects of special-interest money and to make the

legislative process operate more efficiently. After last November there is a

perception of hope that the new majority will at least try to do the latter.

(The Republican Party has never been enthusiastic about campaign-finance or

lobbying reform.) But the Republicans, while in some ways addressing the

expanding role of the federal government, appear only slightly more aware than

the Democrats before them of the real polarities of sentiment that will have to

be addressed before Congress can truly be reformed.<p>



<p>



Few of the proposed structural reforms, moreover, would have the effect their

proponents suggest. The notion, for example, that a national referendum would

be any less susceptible than the legislative process to special-interest

influence is ludicrous; and studies on term limits suggest that imposing a

twelve-year limit would increase the mean turnover rate in the House by all of

one percent per election (though it might, for better or worse, change the type

of person elected to Congress). Sending Congress home for six months a year, or

cutting down on staff, means that legislators would do less, more slowly;

eliminating the filibuster and instituting referenda would be designed to get

more or different laws on the books more quickly.<p>



<p>



These reforms would not solve "the problem" with Congress, because voters and

their representatives are terribly confused about what that is. Voters say they

want less government at lower cost, but they apparently want it to do much of

what it now does--or more. Polls tell us that among the major complaints about

Congress are that it doesn't represent the voters well enough and that it

becomes gridlocked--failing to solve the nation's lingering problems, such as

health care and welfare reform. Yet over the past two generations Congress has

become far more representative and responsive than it used to be, and it now

addresses issues that previous legislatures never dreamed of. Nevertheless, as

public disillusionment increases, the impulse has been to become even more

closely tied to public opinion and to find new legislative ways of attacking

megaproblems more quickly and efficiently. The Republicans don't propose to

turn all of crime control or tort-law reform over to the states; they propose

to enact many of the sweeping reforms themselves, and do it better and faster

than the Democrats. So the demands and the contradictions spiral on, out of

control. The solutions are manifestations of the problem.<p>



<p>



Ironically, what Congress may need is not more democracy but less, and the will

to address not bigger problems faster but smaller ones in more-measured ways.

Admittedly, much of the civil-rights legislation of the 1960s changed the

country profoundly for the better, and subsequent efforts toward greater

democracy and openness were implemented in good faith. Now it is time to

declare these efforts a success--we have democratized the process!--and move on

to developing a public philosophy to address some of the problems we have

acquired from encouraging access to national government.<p>



<p>



In the populist rush to extend the spirit of democracy that, as Alexis de

Tocqueville reminded us 150 years ago, is part of the American character,

today's voters and leaders often forget that this is, in the end, a republic.

The founders feared the power of the mob and provided distance between the

rulers and the ruled, so that our representatives could deliberate much like a

jury and exercise collective judgment and even wisdom. Their job, in the words

of The Federalist Papers, was to "refine and enlarge" the popular will. It is a

hierarchical relationship; they are entrusted with power. No parents or

teachers worth their salt poll their children or pupils constantly and then

give in at the first sign of discontent--just as no legislators in their right

minds would cut taxes while keeping government benefits the same. Yet that's

what pure representation will do for us a lot of the time. Paradoxically,

giving legislators the freedom to forget about public opinion once in a while

would do much to restore the voters' faith in the integrity of their

representatives. Similarly, few would quarrel with the success of much of the

New Deal--and even some of the Great Society--and many of our problems do

require national solutions. But they don't necessarily demand complicated,

comprehensive solutions.<p>



<p>



"If I could get legislators to do just one thing, it would be to take a

political Hippocratic oath," the author Alan Ehrenhalt says. "First, do no

harm. Just attack things you can do something about." Theodore Lowi concurs.

"Congress should narrow its agenda to a few things it knows how to do," he

says. "And it should quit writing these large bills which pretend to address a

problem but really don't, and create unforeseen problems in their wake."<p>



<p>



Those steps alone, it seems, would require a shift in sentiment, in both

parties and in the nation at large, not simply because they might mean the

passage of fewer complicated entitlement programs for the middle class, but

also because they would spell the end of the notion that there can somehow be a

risk-free society with a government solution to every problem. The public and

the press would also be required to re-evaluate whether a buzz of legislative

activity really constitutes a "golden age," and whether gridlock--which often

means doing nothing because nothing can be done or because we don't know what

to do--is always such a terrible thing. Yet such a change would even benefit

liberalism. Congress would do less, but might well do better what it did,

thereby increasing confidence in the national government generally. And the

body might then have the will, occasionally, to act in the national interest by

expanding government, even if that meant temporarily rejecting public

opinion.<p>

<blockquote>



<i><font size=4>The cause of our huge budget

deficits is not government waste or welfare programs for the poor--it's the

out-of-control spending on welfare programs (called "entitlements") for the

middle and upper classes. President Clinton's plan barely makes a dent in this

spending.</i></font><p>



<p><br><p><br>



<font size=5>E</font><font size=3>arly on in his presidential campaign Bill Clinton talked about the need for

Americans to pull together and "sacrifice." Later, in a State of the Union

address remarkable for its candor, he spoke to a raptly attentive nation about

how our ballooning federal deficits cloud our economic future. That was a

subject George Bush had found worthy of mention only once in his 5,000-word

State of the Union address the year before. The budget plan that Bill Clinton

then delivered to Congress not only used real numbers instead of rosy

scenarios; it shattered some paralyzing dogmas. The nonsense that we could put

our fiscal house in order without new taxes was laid to rest. Especially

commendable was the President's opening the door to energy taxes, which not

only raise revenues but also represent a means to curb a particularly toxic

kind of consumption. Even Social Security, our ultimate sacred cow, was put on

the budget-cutting table--if only at the table's edge. After years of empty

"Morning in America" and "Don't Worry, Be Happy" rhetoric, all of this was

welcome--even intoxicating--to us deficit hawks.<p>



<p>



<p>



But in the end the actual sacrifice called for under the Clinton plan is so

mild and selective that it can hardly be said to address our long-term economic

challenges. The President's new taxes on the "rich" turned out to spare almost

entirely a much enlarged but fiscally misnamed middle class, excluding all but

the top one percent of U.S. tax filers. Despite all the talk of draconian

sacrifice, the Clinton plan's proposed energy tax amounted to little more than

a flea bite. As for entitlements, the thing that mattered most, the President

barely managed to crimp their growth. From 1993 to 2004 federal benefit

spending under the original Clinton plan, which, in its handling of

entitlements and its overall budget savings, differs only in detail from what

Congress approved, would have soared by some $730 billion--as compared with

$790 billion under the Congressional Budget Office's business-as-usual baseline

scenario.<p>



<p>



<p>



Without much broader sacrifice--and a presidential vision that truly explains

its purpose and inspires us to consume less today for a better tomorrow--we

will never cure America's economic ills.<p>



<p>



<p>



The Clinton plan doesn't come close to balancing the budget, even in the near

term. According to the numbers developed by the White House itself, if the

President's entire original budget package had been passed and implemented, by

1997 the federal deficit would have declined by only $140 billion from what it

otherwise would have been. That would put it at $206 billion, or 2.7 percent of

gross domestic product--just a smidgen under where it was (3.0 percent of GDP)

in 1989 before the recession began. If 2.7 percent of GDP doesn't seem like a

lot, consider that in 1992 a deficit that size would have soaked up about half

of U.S. net private savings. And consider also that about three quarters of the

spending cuts that the President has proposed for 1994 to 1998--modest as they

are--are only to take place after the 1996 election, which, of course, raises

the risk that they will not materialize at all.<p>



<p>



<p>



After 1997 the federal deficit will once again begin to rise rapidly. Under the

impact of continued growth in entitlement spending, by 2004 it will have

climbed to about $465 billion, or 4.6 percent of GDP. As the Baby Boom

generation begins to reach retirement age in the years that follow, a General

Accounting Office study indicates, the deficit could then soar to an

unthinkable 21 percent of GNP in the year 2020, when today's toddlers are

starting to raise their own families.<p>



<p>



<p>



Economists disagree on many things, but almost none would disagree that it is

essential not to let our public debt grow faster than the economy. Yet under

the Clinton plan public debt is on track to grow far faster than the economy.

Today public debt is already at a higher level--55 percent of GDP--than it has

been at any other time since the mid-1950s, when we were still paying off the

costs of the Second World War. Because the Clinton budget plan leaves on the

table a full two thirds of deficits previously projected for 1993-2004, public

debt will grow to about 65 percent of GDP by the end of that period. And along

with the debt, needless to say, federal interest costs will soar.<p>



<p>



<p>



Considering how ravenously a large deficit consumes national savings--and

Clinton has spoken eloquently about this--and how important the availability of

savings is to making the future-oriented investments that Clinton says he wants

(and that America surely needs), how can we possibly justify short-term

tweaking of the deficit in lieu of radical surgery to balance the budget?<p>



<p>



<p>



I have asked the Clinton people this question. One answer they offer is that

the volcanic eruption of red ink projected for after 1997 will never occur,

owing to steps they will take to control that most intractable force driving

our deficits--exploding health-care costs.<p>



<p>



<p>



The President is certainly right to go after health care. This is where much of

deficit reduction must occur. But as to whether Bill Clinton will find his

hoped-for health-care savings, I am more than a bit skeptical. As Charles

Schultze, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, put it, "God

couldn't design a program" that will achieve net savings in health care in the

near term. The President, after all, is proposing that we spend <i>more</i> on health

care--according to some, as much as $100 billion to $150 billion annually in

new public and private benefits, much of it picked up by the federal

government. In the longer term achieving real savings elsewhere in health care

will require real sacrifices--including, ultimately, selective rationing of

high-cost, low-benefit medical technologies and services. But the

Administration isn't preparing the American people for such sacrifices. Until

it does, it won't be able to come up with enough health-care savings to offset

the cost of the benefit expansions we are now talking about, much less

contribute to overall deficit reduction.<p>



<p>



<p>



Bill Clinton warned of an economic Armageddon if we fail to change course--but

then all he was able to give us to cure our economy's ills was a few teaspoons

of syrupy medicine.<p>



<p>



<p>



What happened? The President, according to senior aides, kept asking, "What is

politically feasible? I do not want this to be another budget that is D.O.A."

In the end his political advisers told him he couldn't ask for sacrifice where

he had to--from the great American middle class. Let me now speak the unpopular

truths that I am sure the President knows but believes are too politically

dangerous to act upon. Let me turn to the problem of the great American middle

class--and the absolutely essential role it must play in shared national

sacrifice if we are to reclaim our future.<p>



<p>



<p>



<br><b>The Brutal Truth</b><p>



<p>



If you listen carefully to most economists and policy experts today, a

consensus emerges about the magnitude of America's economic challenges and what

sorts of reforms will be necessary to overcome them.<p>



<p>



<p>



In particular, most would agree with the following: (1) To get American living

standards rising again, we must increase productivity growth. (2) To boost

productivity we must invest more--much, much more--not just in machines but in

research and development, in infrastructure, and in people. Making the new

investments we need if we are again to know the kind of rising living standards

we remember from the 1950s and 1960s will require a lot of money. Many, myself

included, think that at least $400 billion a year in new investments is needed

in order to boost our rate of investment back toward our long-term historical

average and put us in the ballpark of what other major industrial countries are

now managing to invest. (3) This in turn means that we must save much, much

more--at least $400 billion a year more (4) The surest and fastest way to

increase our savings is to reduce and eventually eliminate the federal deficit,

which is really just a form of negative public savings. (5) To reduce the

deficit and keep it down we must make major cuts in consumption spending, and

in particular in entitlements. But this, alas, requires us to confront a brutal

question: If we are to save more by consuming less, whose consumption growth do

we propose to cut?<p>



<p>



<p>



It's at this point that agreement on what needs to be done, while not exactly

breaking down, comes face to face with a truth that remains politically

inexpressible. That truth is that the problem is all of us. <i>Most

Americans--emphatically including the middle class--will have to give something

up, at least temporarily, to get back our American Dream.</i><p>



<p>



<p>



We all remember the slogan that came out of the Clinton campaign: "It's the

economy, stupid." Well, when it comes to the budget, the watchword ought to be

"It's entitlements, stupid." From Social Security and Medicare to the vast tax

favors for home-mortgage interest and employer-paid health insurance (policy

wonks call these benefitlike subsidies in our tax code "tax expenditures"),

consumption-oriented spending dominates the budget today. And the explosive

growth of these entitlements will continue to rob our future. The budget

arithmetic is inescapable: we just can't get the spending cuts we need from

anywhere but entitlements. As big as it is, even defense spending isn't big

enough. We could shut down the Pentagon tomorrow and still not balance the

budget. Nor can we count on saving much on our huge interest bill unless we

first reduce other types of spending. Interest on the national debt is

something that we must pay to avoid a devastating financial panic--and it keeps

growing as our national debt grows, just as it would fall if we began to attack

the deficit. The rest of what government does represents just pennies out of

the overall budget dollar.<p>



<p>



<p>

<br>

<b>The Cost of Entitlements</b><p>



<p>



Let's define some key terms and look at some key facts about entitlements.

"Entitlements" are any public-sector payments, received by a person or a

household, that do not represent contractual compensation for goods or

services. This definition obviously excludes large portions of the federal

budget, from defense procurement to interest on the national debt to purchases

designed for America's collective benefit (such as highway construction). But

it includes nearly everything else--most notably such dominating fixtures of

the American political landscape as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food

stamps, unemployment compensation, veterans' benefits, and farm aid, to say

nothing of our lavish federal pension systems.<p>



<p>



<p>



The most striking single fact about entitlements is their vast cost. Over the

course of fiscal year 1993 the U.S. Treasury will have mailed out benefit

checks (directly to individuals or to state agencies and insurance companies

that administer benefits) totaling some $800 billion, or about one eighth of

our nation's GDP. That amounts to more than half (53.5 percent) of the entire

federal budget--or about $6 million every minute of every working day, flowing

to one out of two American households. These figures, moreover, include only

direct outlays from the federal budget. The numbers would be even larger if we

included tax expenditures. If we count them and add the cost of administering

entitlement programs--as many economists argue we should in order to get the

full picture--federal entitlements now amount to more than $1 trillion annually

and flow to well over three quarters of all U.S. households.<p>



<p>



<p>

<br>

<b>Ten Myths About Entitlements</b><p>



<p>



Myths about entitlements are everywhere. They are used--and abused--in the

political dialogue in ways that seem to make reasoned debate and reasonable

reforms impossible. Let's look at ten of the most common myths.<p>



<p>



<p>



<b>1. Most federal social spending goes to the poor.</b><p>



<p>



<p>



It is important to remember what entitlements have done to reduce poverty.

Before the New Deal millions of Americans had no means of support in the event

of unemployment, disability, unexpected retirement, or the death of a parent or

spouse. Vast numbers of children grew up in destitute families. At great cost

to society and the economy, millions of workers could fall into poverty and

never recover. In 1937 President Franklin D. Roosevelt could say, "I see one

third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished." Today entitlements

prevent some 20 million Americans (half of them elderly) from falling into

poverty.<p>



<p>



<p>



This is clearly all to the good. However, keeping people out of poverty is not

the purpose toward which most entitlement spending is directed. In reality,

only about one out of eight federal dollars of social spending serves to lift

poor families above the poverty line. Only about one out of four federal

benefit dollars even flows through a program that uses financial need as a

criterion for eligibility. Counting both direct benefits and the value of

entitlements conveyed through the tax code, the aggregate amounts received by

people above the national median income are simply staggering. In 1991 nearly

half of all entitlements went to households with incomes over $30,000. One

quarter went to households with incomes over $50,000.<p>



<p>



<b>2. Entitlement spending helps to equalize incomes by giving more to the poor

than to the rich.</b><p>



<p>



<p>



Few axioms of American political life find such uncritical acceptance as the

belief that social-welfare programs effect a dramatic redistribution of wealth

in favor of low-income households. It apparently makes little difference that

most experts, liberal and conservative alike, have never subscribed to this

axiom--and that recent data repudiate it altogether.<p>



<p>



<p>



Back in the sixties the Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman used to shock

audiences by asserting that Social Security was actually a regressive

program--since the program's mildly progressive benefit formula compensated

neither for its regressive payroll tax nor for the fact that the poor pay taxes

over more years (since they tend to start working at a younger age) and receive

benefits over fewer years (since they tend also to die at a younger age). Most

economists found Friedman's analysis at least plausible; no one has yet

disproved it. More recently the celebrated political scientist Mancur Olson

looked over the panoply of American entitlement programs and concluded:<p>



<p>

<blockquote>

<p>



"Most of the redistribution of government is not from upper-income and

middle-income people to low-income people. Most of the redistribution of income

in fact is from middle-income people to other middle-income people, or from the

whole of society to particular groups of rich people, or from one group to

another where the groups are distinguished not by one being poor and the other

being rich, but only by the fact that some groups are organized and some are

not."</blockquote><p>



<p>



<p>



Income data from the Congressional Budget Office tend to bear out Olson's

critique. Total federal benefits to the affluent are at least as substantial as

those to the needy. Among Social Security beneficiaries, for instance,

households with incomes of $100,000 or more receive, on average, checks that

are twice as large as those of households with incomes of less than $10,000.

Even when we add in the cash and in-kind benefits disbursed by all of the other

federal sources for which we have income data--including "means-tested" welfare

and food stamps--we find that households in the top bracket ($100,000 and up)

received an average of about $5,700 in 1991, slightly more than the average of

$5,600 received by households in the bottom bracket (under $10,000).<p>



<p>



<p>



But direct federal payments are not the only way in which the federal

government distributes benefits. We also have to take tax expenditures into

account. These loopholes, designed to favor certain households and bearing no

relationship to ability to pay, are the fiscal and economic equivalent of a

government check. Most tax expenditures are unquestionably regressive: many

poor households cannot qualify for them--and even when they do, what they

receive is smaller, relative to their income, than what the affluent get. This

year, for example, the Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that

the average value of the home-mortgage interest deduction for taxpayers with

incomes over $100,000 is $3,453 and that the same deduction is worth an average

of only $478 for taxpayers in the $20,000 to $30,000 bracket. Even these

figures include only those who qualified for the benefit. They exclude many

low-income families, including renters and those who opted for the standard

deduction, who do not qualify.<p>



<p>



<p>



When we add together all the direct-benefit outlays and all the tax

expenditures, an unambiguous picture emerges. On average, a household with an

income under $10,000 collected roughly $5,700 in 1991. On average, a household

with an income over $100,000 collected $9,300. This distribution of benefits by

income became more--not less--skewed during the 1980s. Clearly, it has nothing

to do with economic equality. Let's phrase the issue a bit more bluntly. If the

federal government's purpose were to straighten out the national income

distribution, it would do a better job if it dispensed with all the

programmatic rules and simply scattered all the money by airplane over every

population center, to be gathered at random by passers-by.<p>



<p>



<p>



<b>3. Social Security and Medicare are an earned right: beneficiaries are only

getting back what they paid in.</b><p>



<p>



<p>



Here the case is open and shut. Most currently retired Americans receive Social

Security benefits that are two to five times greater than the actuarial value

of prior contributions, by both employer and employee. The payback for the

Medicare Hospital Insurance program is five to twenty times greater. A typical

middle-income couple who retired in 1981 have already received back, with

interest, not only the total actuarial value of their previous Social Security

and Medicare taxes but also the total value of their lifetime federal income

taxes.<p>



<p>



<p>



And these calculations of actuarial value are conservative. They assume that

employer contributions "belong" to the beneficiary and that the public must

guarantee a "market" interest rate on all contributions, no matter what the

condition of the economy or the wages of those who are taxed to make good on

this claim. In fact, the Social Security Administration keeps no direct record

of how much each person contributes. It just keeps records of each person's

wage history, to which a politically determined formula is applied when that

person retires.<p>



<p>



<p>



The politically potent and disingenuous language adopted by the Social Security

Administration has contributed to the earned-right myth. The system is

described as an "insurance" program, although it is nothing of the sort.

References are made to contributors' "accounts," when no such accounts exist.<p>



<p>



<p>



My father, helped along by years of such misleading nomenclature, went to his

grave thinking that he was simply getting back his money, by which he meant

what he had put into his "account" over the years. Since by this logic the

benefits belonged to him, any proposal to take any of them away was both unjust

and immoral. In truth, it was as though the government had a moral obligation

to provide a windfall forever. He could only wonder why his otherwise

well-educated son thought differently. I could never persuade him. It would

have depressed him to find out that in fact there was no Social Security

savings account in Washington with George Peterson's name on it.<p>



<p>



<p>



Nor would I have wanted to depress him further with other unpleasant facts

about entitlements. My father was immensely supportive of my wife's work in

behalf of poor children at the Children's Television Workshop. He would have

been distressed to learn that in 1986, the last year of his life, the nation

was told that it could not afford to fund fully the much-admired Head Start

program. Yet merely the increases in Social Security's cost-of-living

adjustments that year would have fully funded Head Start. Had he known the

facts, I am confident he would have been happy to give up his sliver of the

huge entitlement pie for such a worthy cause.<p>



<p>



<p>



<b>4. The elderly, as a group, are poorer than young Americans.</b><p>



<p>



<p>



In reality, the 1990 official poverty rate among the over-sixty-five population

was 12 percent, as compared with 21 percent among children. When we include the

value of all noncash benefits as income, the poverty rate for the elderly is

six percent, as against 15 percent for children. On this latter basis poor

children outnumber the poor elderly in America by more than five to one. In no

other major industrial nation is the poverty rate for children (using identical

definitions) anywhere near what it is in the United States.<p>



<p>



<p>



Children are the truly needy in our society, but they certainly don't get most

of the public money. In 1990 of all direct federal benefits 63 percent went to

the 13 percent of all Americans over age sixty-five, while nine percent went to

the 26 percent of all Americans under age eighteen. On a per capita basis, and

including all federal outlays that might be called "child benefits," from

education to immunization, the ratio of average benefits received was eleven to

one $13,8930 to each elderly person and $1,271 to each child. Even adding in

everything spent by state and local governments (on schools, for instance), the

ratio still favors the elderly by at least three to one.<p>



<p>



<p>



Some argue that entitlements for the elderly merely substitute for transfers of

wealth that the young would otherwise make to their parents. That might be true

if these programs weren't so lavish. Before Social Security and Medicare, young

families did sacrifice for older parents--if and when Mom and Pop were in need.

Yet because today's retirees are, as a whole, wealthier than the young, adults

aged twenty-five to thirty-four now report receiving from their parents twenty

times more support than they give to them; even for adults thirty-five to

forty-four, the ratio is five to one. Social Security and Medicare, far from

embodying traditional family values, have turned them on their head.<p>



<p>



<p>



<b>5. Social Security is building up a huge surplus that will be available to pay

for benefits promised to Baby Boomers.</b><p>



<p>



<p>



It is true that Social Security receipts from payroll withholding taxes

currently paid into the retirement part of the Social Security system (not the

health-care or Medicare part) are higher than Social Security expenditures, and

will probably remain so until the Baby Boomers start retiring in large numbers.

But this surplus is temporary. What is more, the funds are not being saved or

invested. Instead they are being used to help offset each year's overall

federal budget deficit. Thus these surpluses are transformed into debts held by

the Social Security trust funds. Future taxpayers will become liable for the

principal and interest.<p>



<p>



Let's peer into the future to see what the real financial status of our old-age

benefit programs is. In assessing their solvency actuaries tally up what are

known as unfunded liabilities--the amounts (in this year's discounted dollars)

by which future benefits promised to today's adults exceed all their future

payroll taxes plus the assets currently held in all the government's relevant

"trust funds." The federal government's unfunded liabilities<p>



for just four programs--Social Security, Medicare, and federal civil-service

and military retirement--come to about $14 trillion. That's a sum several times

larger than the national debt, and one equivalent to roughly $140,000 for every

household. This is a system in surplus?<p>



<p>



<p>



<b>6. Today's younger Americans will eventually receive the same health and

pension benefits they are providing today's retirees.</b><p>



<p>



<p>



Recently the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on likely paybacks to

various generations. No expert disagreed on the trend (an unusual fact in

itself): the earliest beneficiaries got by far the best deal, and the deal has

been getting worse for each successive generation. By some calculations some

upper-income single males retiring this year may get less out of Social

Security than they put in.<p>



<p>



<p>



Moreover, financing even the reduced returns that are promised to tomorrow's

retirees is unlikely to be economically or politically sustainable as America

ages. The Social Security Administration projects that, depending on

demographic and economic trends, the cost of Social Security and Medicare will

by 2040 rise to between 38 percent and 53 percent of payroll--unless we cut

benefits. I believe the only real question is when, not whether, we will change

course. We can make modest, fair-share sacrifices now. Or we can make wrenching

changes later, amid economic crisis and, as Paul Tsongas would say,

intergenerational war. The choice is not just economic but also moral. I can

imagine few ethical principles more important than fairness toward our

children.<p>



<p>



<p>



<b>7. Retirement benefits are an "inviolable contract" between the generations.</b><p>



<p>



<p>



No, Virginia, there is no sacred contract, at least not according to the U.S.

Supreme Court, which has repeatedly ruled that no covered worker retains any

rights, contractual or otherwise, over taxes paid into the Social Security

system. Perhaps I may be permitted a layman's less lofty legal opinion. As I

recall (from a college course in commercial law), one fundamental requirement

of a valid contract is a "meeting of the minds" of the parties to the contract:

between those who pay and those who receive. But no such meeting of the minds

exists. I am not aware that anyone has consulted my grandson, Peter Cary, now

aged three, about the staggering tax rates that our current entitlement

"contracts" will require him to pay when he enters the work force.<p>



<p>



<p>



Simply repeating "inviolable contract," "mandatory," "nondiscretionary,"

"uncontrollable" payments, or some other disingenuous mantra does not change

certain truths. What Congress mindlessly gives can be taken away. A fundamental

reality is that the current system is not sustainable. If Social Security (or

Medicare) is a contract, it is an unenforceable one.<p>



<p>



<p>



<b>8. Tax breaks for health insurance primarily benefit people who otherwise could

not afford proper health care.</b><p>



<p>



<p>



Maybe this one isn't really a myth, but the regressivity of our subsidies to

privately paid health care is too shocking not to mention. In 1994 exempting

employer-paid health insurance from taxes will cost the U.S. Treasury about $75

billion. Needless to say, of the 35 million or so Americans without health

insurance, who receive zero benefits from this huge tax break, most are poor or

low-income citizens. Among households that do have insurance, those with the

highest incomes and the most generous insurance plans receive several times as

much from this federal tax subsidy as those with low incomes and a

cost-conscious HMO.<p>



<p>



<p>



<b>9. The federal government's major housing entitlement, the home-mortgage

interest deduction, promotes homeownership and stimulates the economy.</b><p>



<p>



<p>



In 1994 the cost of the home-mortgage interest deduction in lost revenues to

the federal Treasury will be $46 billion, 80 percent of which will go directly

to households with incomes over $50,000. The main economic effect of the

home-mortgage deduction is to inflate the price (and size) of homes, while

diverting investment away from more productive sectors of the economy.<p>



<p>



<p>



Our global competitors, who hear us publicly rail about our investment-starved

economy and the stagnation of our productivity, politely ask what conceivable

connection this tax subsidy for the relatively well off has with enhancing

productivity. Officials in Canada regularly chide me about the fact that Canada

has the same rate of homeownership as the United States without the benefit of

this tax subsidy.<p>



<p>



<p>



Why, then, do we have it? The answer, of course, does not lie in any real

economic imperative. The subsidy exists because we all think we deserve it.

What's more, it props up one of our most powerful special interests: the

real-estate lobby.<p>



<p>



<p>



<b>10. The only reason that Ronald Reagan could not keep his promise to shrink the

size of government was the huge rise in defense spending.</b><p>



<p>



<p>



Judging by the cheers of his supporters and the jeers of his critics, we might

suppose that President Ronald Reagan cut everything but defense. And judging by

the similar partisan bickering over the policies of his successor, George Bush,

we might suppose that the "welfare state" was the victim of further slashing

and hacking for another four years after Reagan stepped down.<p>



<p>



<p>



But the reality is very different: the cost of all direct federal benefits

today ($807 billion in fiscal year 1993) is considerably greater than the

entire federal Budget that existed when Reagan first took office ($696 billion

in fiscal year 1981). In fact, adjusted for inflation, federal benefits soared

by 54 percent from 1981 to 1993--while all other domestic spending showed zero

real growth, and defense, the one area where everyone supposed the Reagan and

Bush Administrations had gone hog-wild, showed real growth of only 15

percent.<p>



<p>



<p>



Contrary to popular impressions, the advent of the Reagan-Bush era did not

signal a decisive shift in entitlement policy. With the exception of the 1983

Social Security amendments (designed by a bipartisan commission), both

Presidents left non-means-tested outlays and tax expenditures--that is, most

entitlements--on autopilot. Thus the Reagan-Bush years only reaffirmed that

these vast middle- and upper-class entitlements were politically

"uncontrollable"--a weasel word behind which Congress and the President can

hide their unwillingness to act, since together they can control any spending

they want.<p>



<p>



<p>



<br><b>The Middle Class: The Third Rail of American Politics</b><p>



<p>



 The middle class is at the heart of our budget problem--and must be at the

heart of the solution. Taken together, the major benefit programs for which we

have income data on recipients--spending roughly 80 percent of total federal

benefit dollars, and including everything from Social Security and Medicare to

AFDC and food stamps--deliver 99 percent of their benefits ($529 billion in

1991) to the 99 percent of American households with incomes under $200,000.

This is the upper boundary of what President Clinton has for political

convenience defined as the "middle class." (The income-tax increases proposed

by the Clinton Administration begin at $140,000 of taxable income, the number

most people have heard quoted. But that's really equivalent to about $200,000

of adjusted gross income from all sources.)<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet 43 percent of such benefit dollars ($227 billion in 1991) go to households

that cannot possibly be considered poor: those with incomes between $30,000 and

$200,000. And note that the absolute dollar figure surely understates the total

since it reflects only 80 percent of all benefit dollars. What about the

remaining 20 percent? We cannot be sure. Some of it flows through programs such

as Medicaid, which mostly benefit lower-income households; some, too, flows

through programs such as student loans, farm aid, and veterans' health care,

which disproportionately benefit upper-income households. All told, it would be

safe to assume that total federal benefit outlays reaching the

$30,000-to-$200,000 income bracket amounted to at least $265 billion in 1991.<p>



<p>



<p>



And what about our ocean of so-called tax expenditures--the subtle subsidies

that help the wealthy borrow huge sums for home mortgages and take unlimited

health-care deductions? More than two thirds go to tax filers with incomes

between $30,000 and $200,000. Just seven percent go to the Americans whom the

President calls "rich."<p>



<p>



<p>



The top-earning one percent of Americans, it's true, receive 13 percent of all

income in the United States. Going after the rich to help balance the budget is

fine--as far as it goes. Unlike some of my Wall Street colleagues, I see

absolutely nothing wrong with imposing higher tax burdens on the wealthiest in

our society. But it does not require any arcane knowledge of fiscal arithmetic

to see that even with the substantial tax increases proposed by the Clinton

plan, trying to balance the budget is quite literally impossible on such a

narrow stretch of income territory. In fact, to meet this goal by the year 2000

by taxing the "rich," we would need to tax away all the taxable income of

everyone with more than $175,000 of adjusted gross income. Or, if we would

prefer a less draconian approach, we could merely double the income taxes of

"affluent" tax filers--but we would need to include everyone down to about

$50,000 of income. Even this kinder and gentler approach would amount to

something more like expropriation--hardly consistent with either free markets

or democracy.<p>



<p>



<p>



As for direct entitlement benefits, here too not much help is available from

the rich. The maximum entitlement savings obtainable from the one percent of

households enjoying incomes of more than $200,000 are unfortunately limited to

the benefits that go to them--about $5 billion if we took away all their

benefits (something that even Bill Clinton, with his laser beam on the rich,

has never dreamed of suggesting).<p>



<p>



<p>



But if we are willing to ask for even modest sacrifices from all Americans with

incomes above about $30,000, the picture changes entirely. Suddenly we're

talking about a whopping 73 percent of national household income. We're also

talking about a stunning 74 percent of all tax expenditures and 43 percent of

major federal entitlement benefits, which, taken together--and including our

estimate for all benefits--amounted to $372 billion in 1991. That's a sum we

simply cannot afford to ignore if we are at all serious about putting our

fiscal house in order.<p>



<p>



<p>



Twelve years ago, when Ronald Reagan ascended to the White Louse, I hoped that

his politically candid talk about cutting the budget deficit would lead to

politically courageous action. But instead we found a convenient scapegoat. The

"poor," we learned, were bankrupting America. Just eliminate the "waste, fraud,

and abuse" in our welfare system--all those mink-wearing welfare queens driving

Cadillacs and buying vodka at taxpayers' expense--and a balanced budget would

be in reach. The premise, of course, was wrong from the beginning. Despite cuts

in programs for the poorest Americans during the Reagan years, the deficit kept

exploding.<p>



<p>



<p>



When Bill Clinton ascended to the White House, I was once again hopeful that

the President would seize the moment and make the tough choices needed to cut

the deficit and boost savings and investment. But we seem to be caught up in

another form of scapegoating. This time it's not the poor who are to blame;

it's the rich who are not paying their way.<p>



<p>



<p>



To be sure, President Clinton will get further with his scapegoat than

President Reagan did with his. But both ways of dodging tough choices veer away

from the heart of the problem. We are all implicated in our budget deficits,

our entitlement ethos, and the overall consumption bias in our economy. And all

of us most particularly the broad middle class that is the backbone of America,

must now be part of the solution.<p>



<p>



<p>



Let's pause for a moment to ask ourselves, what in reality is the "middle

class"? Ask any American if he or she is "middle class," and the answer will

almost always be yes. The truly poor will admit to being "lower middle class,"

and the rich will go along with "upper middle class," but few will forthrightly

call themselves "poor" or "rich." This is a characteristically American

self-perception, and it reflects our desire to live in a basically egalitarian

society. But in recent years it has allowed nonpoor Americans to believe that

they deserve universal federal entitlements--much of them windfalls--such as

Social Security and Medicare, which are often disingenuously called

"insurance," and which people mistakenly think of as the payback on their

contributions to "their accounts."<p>



<p>



<p>



Next, ask any group of Americans to specify the annual income that defines

"middle class" and you'll hear responses ranging from, say, $20,000 all the way

up to $200,000--if we include the Clinton Administration's definition. But

there are more precise and realistic definitions. If nontaxable entitlement

benefits and other tax-exempt income are included with adjusted gross income

reported to the IRS, the median family in the United States had a total

adjusted gross income of $31,700 in 1993. If "middle class" is then narrowly

defined as comprising half of all American families equally distributed around

that $31,700 family, the statistical middle-class income turns out to range

from $14,040 to $55,880.<p>



<p>



<p>



This exposition regularly startles those who are new to it. A family with

$60,000 of income invariably thinks of itself as "just getting by," but it

actually stands in the top quarter of families. A two-earner family with an

income of $120,000 may think of itself as just middle class. In fact that

two-earner family stands in the top five percent of American families. By the

time we reach those with incomes in excess of $200,000--the only households

targeted for significant sacrifices by the Clinton Administration's

proposals--we are left with a mere statistical sliver of the population:

roughly one percent.<p>



<p>



Middle-class Americans today, it seems, suffer from what might be called a

"reverse Lake Wobegon" syndrome. As Garrison Keillor fans know, Lake Wobegon is

a wonderful fictional place where all the children are above average. When it

comes to incomes, however, most middle-class Americans, trying hard to make

ends meet, assume they must be below average.<p>



<p>



<p>



Middle-class Americans today feel hard pressed and beleaguered--and they are.

Nobody could possibly argue that even a well-above-the-median $50,000 a year in

household income will put one on easy street. It's hard to make it on a typical

middle-class income today--when paychecks barely keep up with the cost of

homes, of college educations and even of necessities.<p>



<p>



<p>



Working hard and trying to follow the rules, middle-class Americans have

adopted a kind of siege mentality in the face of evaporating expectations about

fixture income growth. The middle class is already making a de facto and

unplanned sacrifice in terms of the loss of upward mobility. But an organized,

planned, and temporary additional sacrifice can reverse that trend. Only if we

all give up something to reinvest in our future will we be able to rekindle the

rise in U.S. living standards. If we all just hunker down to protect what we

feel we're entitled to, we will condemn ourselves to a future that grows

bleaker each year. Evaporating and diminished expectations are not what America

is about. The willingness of middle-class citizens to sacrifice a little today

for a better tomorrow is, however, exactly what America used to be about and

ought to be about once again.<p>



<p>



<p>



In spite of the recent stagnation of its living standards, the American middle

class is still the world's richest middle class, consuming far more than any of

its counterparts in Europe or Japan--and paying far lower taxes than most.

Indeed, Americans may think themselves overtaxed, but we pay some 10 to 20

percent less of our national income in taxes than do the citizens of most other

industrialized countries. The actual economic room for sacrifice exists; what

we are missing is the public understanding and the political will to recognize

such sacrifices as being in our long-term best interests.<p>



<p>



<p>



We can't, of course, call on the middle class alone to sacrifice. The rich must

pay their fuller and fairer share. Many of the same people who argue that the

middle class is too beleaguered to contribute to solving our economic problems

stand by silently as the $30,000-a-year middle-class worker pays

ever-increasing payroll taxes (which in many cases come to more than his or her

income taxes) to subsidize the entitlement benefits of retirees who are getting

ten times their contributions in Medicare payments (tax-free) and who may be

earning $100,000 or more a year in retirement. This is unconscionable.<p>



<p>



<p>

<br>

<b>Relearning Our Endowment Ethic</b><p>



<p>



These things are certain: we can't do it without the without the middle class.

And we can't do it without going at entitlements head on.<p>



<p>



<p>



Bill Clinton's decision to skirt entitlements and to spare the middle class

from all but token sacrifice may have seemed a politically expedient course for

the short term, just as it has to the past several Administrations. (According

to the economist Benjamin Friedman, 74 percent of the burden of what deficit

reduction the Clinton plan does achieve through higher taxes or benefit cuts

will be borne by the small share of U.S. families earning more than $100,000.

But it has meant that his only feasible program is one that has no hope of

balancing the budget--or even coming close.<p>



<p>



<p>



Bad economics may end up being bad politics as well. It is a matter of debate

whether the American public is actually ready for real change and tough

choices. And avoiding excessively rapid spending cuts or large tax increases in

the midst of a creeping recovery was an understandable concern--though for all

too many years it has never been the right moment in the business cycle or the

political-election cycle for decisive action on the long-term economic

predicament that by now also harms our short-term economic prospects. Any

responsible budget plan must be phased in gradually if we want to avoid too

bumpy a ride. But I believe that a clear goal of budget balance--and a

commitment to meeting it by the end of the decade--would ultimately go over

better with both the markets and the public than the course Clinton has chosen.

Indeed, if one adopts Richard Nixon's dictum that the economy that matters most

is the one that prevails three months before the next election, the President's

current approach is a dangerous one.<p>



<p>



<p>



By not asking the public to swallow the bitter pills at the outset, Clinton

risks being forced to ask the public--and especially the middle class--to

swallow them later, closer to the 1996 election. At that point, having denied

the middle class its promised tax cut--and having created the impression that

Americans are already making the needed sacrifices when they're not--Clinton

may find the public wondering at the need for further sacrifice. Moreover, the

lift given to the bond market in 1993 by the early promise of deficit reduction

may by 1996 have reversed itself. With health care and other entitlements still

spiraling out of sight, and with private credit demands likely rising as we and

the rest of the world fully emerge from recession, the United States could once

again see soaring interest rates right around election time. As 1996

approaches, Bill Clinton not only inevitably faces a second major

budget-cutting exercise but also runs the distinct risk of being tagged the

Biggest Borrowing President in history--and he won't even have the excuse of

having presided over a divided government. It's easy to imagine a 1996

Republican campaign advertisement along these lines: "Bill Clinton raised your

taxes, still borrowed a million dollars a day, built a bunch of bridges to

nowhere--and this time you know who to blame."<p>



<p>



<p>



My view is that everybody except the poor and near-poor must be part of the

solution to America's economic problems. But as we move through the various

strata of the middle middle class and upper-middle middle class, and on into

the upper middle class, the sacrifices called for in the form of higher taxes

or curtailed entitlement benefits should get much larger. By the time we reach

the genuine upper class, we should have increased the tax bite significantly

and cut deeply into tax subsidies and windfall entitlement benefits.<p>



<p>



<p>



To help restore fiscal and moral responsibility to our entitlement system, the

budget plan I propose in my book <i>Facing Up: How to Rescue the Economy From

Crushing Debt and Restore the American Dream</i> therefore includes an "affluence

test," or a graduated entitlement-benefit reduction. This affluence test (along

the lines of the comprehensive means-testing idea discussed by Neil Howe and

Phillip Longman in "The Next New Deal," in this magazine in April of 1992)

would apply to all federal benefits, both cash and in-kind. No sacrifice would

be required of households with incomes below the U.S. median (generously

assumed to be $35,000 by 1995, when the test's phase-in would begin). For

families with above-median incomes a portion of total entitlement benefits

would be withheld on a steeply progressive basis. Under the test, households

would lose 7.5 percent of all benefits that cause their incomes to exceed

$35,000, plus five percent at the margin for each additional $10,000 in income.

For most types of entitlement benefits, the maximum benefit-reduction rate

would be 85 percent, applicable to household incomes greater than $185,000.<p>



<p>



<p>



If this proposal doesn't silence those who rail that entitlement reform is

inevitably regressive and must ravage the poor, it should at least give them

pause. For families who are earning between $30,000 and $40,000, are receiving

benefits, and are subject to the test, the sacrifice called for would average

just $260 a year--or one percent of their benefits. Moreover, most who would

have to sacrifice are retired and have lower expenses than working-age adults

with similar incomes. For families earning between $50,000 and $75,000, the

sacrifice would rise to an average of $2,310, or 12 percent of benefits; for

families with incomes over $200,000, it would average $15,345, or 72 percent of

benefits.<p>



<p>



<p>



All told, the budget savings made possible by the affluence test are enormous:

at least $93 billion in 2004, on the basis of a conservative calculation that

takes into account only the 80 percent of entitlement benefits for which we

currently have detailed data on recipient income. Affluence testing alone,

however, does not add up to complete entitlement reform. Among other measures,

we will also need to cap our open-ended tax subsidies for retirement, housing,

and health care, accelerate the scheduled rise in Social Security retirement

ages, and trim the largesse of our federal pension systems.<p>



<p>



<p>



All of these reforms involve structural spending cuts that will save

significant money in the 1990s and much more beyond. In a business-as-usual

budget scenario, entitlement costs could be closing in on a quarter of GDP by

2040. Under my plan we would already be saving about 1.9 percent of GDP in

entitlement spending by 2004; by 2040 we would be saving 5.3 percent of GDP or

some $690 billion in today's dollars--more than twice what we now spend on the

Pentagon. That's what I mean by structural spending cuts.<p>



<p>



<p>



We must invent a new entitlement system that will not just pay us affordable

benefits when we need them but will also encourage us to save more for the

future, care better for our own children and parents, and take more

responsibility for our own health. As America itself grows old, perhaps the

most vital changes in our entitlement system will be those that encourage a

positive new vision of aging. Entitlements for the elderly must promote an

active, economically self-sufficient lifestyle for elders who are able. We will

no longer be able to afford a system that equates the last third or more of

one's adult life with a publicly subsidized vacation.<p>



<p>



<p>



Getting our entitlements system back on a sound footing is the key to both a

balanced budget and a renewed rise in U.S. living standards in the next

century. But of course, putting our fiscal house in order will require much,

much more. There is still room for trimming in the small discretionary domestic

corner of the federal budget. I also believe that in this post-Cold War world

we can spend substantially less on defense, and I endorse the President's

proposed cuts. To balance the budget by the year 2000, and at the same time

spend more on worthy public goals, from more-generous targeted assistance to

the poor to productivity-enhancing investments in human capital, research and

development, and infrastructure, we will also need to raise new revenues above

and beyond the tax increases President Clinton has already proposed. Along with

a broad-based progressive consumption tax, I recommend higher "sin" taxes and a

fifty-cent-a-gallon federal gasoline tax phased in over five years, in order to

target a particularly profligate type of consumption. But in the end, unless we

are willing to touch the third rail of American politics and rein in the growth

in middle- and upper-class entitlements, our goal will elude us.<p>



<p>



<p>



The worst aspect of our entitlement addiction is how it subtly fixes our

attention on how much we are going to get--and how it obscures any thought of

what we have received from others and what we wish to pass on in our turn. In

this sense our entitlement ethos pervades not just our public benefit programs

but our entire approach to deficit-financed consumption. It is time for America

to begin unlearning its entitlement ethic and begin relearning its endowment

ethic. At some point we must decide how much we are willing to give up today in

order to save for and invest in a tomorrow of rising living standards for

ourselves and, of course, our children. The alternative--a future without an

American Dream--is no alternative at all. <p>

	THE POLITICS OF MEANING 
	
	</h4>
	<i>by Michael Lerner.</i><br><i>Addison-Wesley, 355 pages,
	<br>$24.00</i><br>
	
	<p>
	
	
	
	
	
	<font size=5>I</font>N the beginning there was a hunger for vision. And then came a great need for
rhetoric. Soon President and Mrs. Clinton sensed representative vibrations in
the quasi-mystical-socio-politico-psychological coat of crazy colors that the
author and activist Michael Lerner calls the <A HREF="http://www.panix.com/~tikkun/pom.html">"politics of meaning."</A> They must
have felt that Lerner, with his talk of a universal inner pain and "hunger" for
connection, might help them administer verbal balm to an America collectively
turning inward amid social and economic disruptions. So, shortly into their
reign, the Clintons summoned Lerner to Washington, thereby setting in motion
Lerner's own inward-turning fall.<p> 
Lerner had come sprawling onto the public scene in 1986 with his magazine
<A HREF="http://www.panix.com/~tikkun/index.html"><i>Tikkun </i></A>. A licensed psychotherapist, he had spent the previous ten years
in Oakland, California, treating patients at a clinic he co-founded called the
Institute for Labor and Mental Health. (Lerner has claimed that his vision for
America came to him through his encounters with patients.) But problems have
beset <i>Tikkun </i>from the start. A former leader of Students for a
Democratic Society and co-editor of the ultraleft magazine <i>Ramparts</i>,
Lerner seemed to long for the old confrontational days. He began to confront
himself. He began to march on his own magazine.<p>

At its best <i>Tikkun </i>has<i> </i>tried to speak with a nonpartisan voice of
common decency, outside the crumbling framework of left-right antitheses. But
for Lerner, all politics is cosmic. And in his own offerings in the magazine,
for page after page he has spluttered on like an old Volkswagen about "pain"
and "healing," "misrecognition" of our true selves and "healing," "surplus
powerlessness" and "healing," "healing" and . . . well, "healing." <p>

Increasingly Lerner's writings have been careering toward strange destinations:
A radical feminist perspective that called for strengthening the family. An
attack on selfishness that talked only about the self. An emphasis on "personal
responsibility" which proclaimed that every individual has been crippled by an
unfeeling world. A version of Judaism as a revolutionary religion which was to
historical Judaism what a macaroon is to a Passover seder. <p>
<br>
<font size=5>O</font>UT of the wilderness, then, where he had wandered through the sands of
psychotherapy for two decades after the New Left's self-destruction, Lerner
bounded hopefully toward 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. This faux-Hasidic
evangelical, this erstwhile Gramscian revolutionary, this former leader of SDS,
sat musing and advising in the White House: a scene almost too beautiful to be
true. For the first time since the 1960s a member of the New Left had a
President's ear, albeit by way of the commanding attention of the First Lady.
(And if Lerner had been a disciple of Talleyrand instead of Gramsci . . . ? The
irreverent mind boggles.) Most interesting, Lerner had not had to revise
himself rightward to pass into the halls of power. He had had only to dust off
a radical disdain for a liberal welfare state's concessions to the status quo.
Then he threw over this old scorn the cloak of a flourishing centrist
impatience with liberal policy.<p>
In a speech she made about health care in April of 1993, Hillary Clinton
dropped the phrase "politics of meaning." Meanwhile, Lerner in his magazine was
fawningly touting Clinton and his own association with the President, complete
with a reproduction of a memo that Clinton as governor of Arkansas had sent
Lerner, thanking him for "clarifying" some important issues. The press swarmed
all over Lerner. <i>The New York Times Magazine </i>ran a corrosive article
about him titled "This Year's Prophet" a month after running an article that
derided the warm reception Hillary Clinton had extended to some of Lerner's
zanier notions.<p>

As a focal point for ideas--universal health insurance, an emphasis on
rebuilding the institutions of civil society, a publicly responsible
journalism--<i>Tikkun</i> at its best never deserved the mostly shallow media
trouncing it got when the First Lady made Lerner's phrase famous. But its best
began to come less and less often. Lerner's grip on the magazine was reducing
it to inanity. And his publicity-hungry maneuverings earned him whatever
vituperation he received. <p>

But fatal for Lerner, the Clintons' instincts about his usefulness proved
monumentally wrong. The "politics of meaning" came down, in the practical
political sense, to changing the reigning cultural "paradigms." "Caring" and
"healing" meant sensitivity to the pain of every faint heart in every narrowing
form of group self-interest. Thus in a country where more and more people were
either losing their jobs or worried about losing their jobs, the question of
homosexuals in the military became paramount. And what began to seem like
feminism's devolution into a mission of further empowering upper-middle-class
women, carried forward in the symbolic presence of the First Lady, topped the
national agenda. <p>

In November of 1994 some pundits strained to understand why the beleaguered
working class and the anxious middle class voted for candidates who would only
preserve a beleaguering and anxiety-producing status quo. The reason is simple.
In contemporary America's whirling culture, promises of stability amount to
promises of change. And the meaning-oriented Clintons, partly inspired by
Lerner's loony visions of a brave new consciousness, promised only to hasten
the pace of flux.<p>
<br>
<font size=5>I</font>N the 1970s the New Left got into the consciousness-changing business in a big
way and made itself extinct. Courage, faith, hard work, and eventual
legislation, not a new cultural hegemony, had changed the lot of black people
in the South. Determined exposure of the truth, expressions of solidarity, and
appeals to American decency, not a transformation of the American mind, had
helped to end the war in Vietnam. But Lerner never really left the ruined
precincts of the theoretical left. He simply translated "bourgeois hegemony"
into "the pain" and the "misrecognition" of our true selves that he believes
deform all our lives. <p>
In <i>The Politics of Meaning</i>, Lerner writes, "There is no one who is not
<i>also </i>a victim, no one who has not been spiritually and emotionally
negated as a child." Such pain creates the "selfishness paradigm" that rules
our society. Healing this pain is "the condition for the fulfillment of our
needs for meaning," for "the consciousness necessary for building a very
different kind of society." And this consciousness is the "condition for the
liberation of our entire society from a materialist and individualist ethos."
There is not much difference between those belligerently vapid statements and
the vapidly belligerent declaration Lerner made twenty-three years ago, in
<i>The New Socialist Revolution: An Introduction to Its Theory and Strategy</i>
(a book that doesn't appear on his list of publications): "The first task of
the revolutionary movement . . . is to destroy bourgeois hegemony and develop a
radical consciousness among each of the potential constituencies for
revolutionary action."<p>

Brother, can you spare a paradigm? The cant term appears over and over in
Lerner's writings, and in this book. It is one of the contemporary left's most
precious conceptual amulets. (It has also been adapted by everyone from
advisers in the Bush White House to business strategists.) Thomas Kuhn
introduced the concept in his <i>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>
(1962), to explain how scientific knowledge proceeds by upheaval. The theories
of Copernicus, Newton, and Einstein, Kuhn wrote, are all self-contained and
discontinuous from one another. There is no steady accumulation of truth in the
form of objective knowledge about the physical universe. Instead each theory is
a "revolutionary" break from the previous theory, resulting in the arbitrary
replacement of one "paradigm" of knowledge by another. Once the paradigm of
knowledge in a given period changes, the way science is done and applied is
completely transformed. <p>

Having migrated to the universities, the New Left cadres seized on Kuhn's idea;
they turned Marx on his head. Marx had argued that material conditions create
consciousness; the new theoreticians would have none of it. They held that
rather than changing material conditions in order to change social attitudes,
it is necessary to engineer new social attitudes--new paradigms of social
knowledge--in order to transform material conditions. <p>

This left, however, so infatuated with the impersonal processes of hard
science, ignored a significant absence in Kuhn's book. Kuhn applied his idea of
paradigm upheavals to the physical sciences but not to the biological sciences.
Knowledge about the circulatory system, for example, from the Renaissance
through the nineteenth century to today, has been more cumulative than in the
physical sciences: there are abiding truths about the operation and treatment
of the human heart. <p>

So, typically, the theoretical left chose the wrong scientific analogy. If it
hadn't, it might have stressed--as the young Marx, along with social democrats
and liberals, did--the relationship between human dignity and the fulfillment
of material needs. For there is nothing so transforming as the certainty of a
prosperous human future growing out of decent employment and guarantees of
life's basic necessities. That is where Marx's early humanism meets life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Meaning and caring and empathy for the
Other often flow from those simple material premises--perhaps even a lifting of
the ban on gays in the military. Yet the contemporary left has steered
liberalism toward the inherently snobbish psychologization of materialism--let
them eat consciousness! --whose desiccated fruits are political correctness and
the "politics of meaning." It was in part such an abstract contempt for
ordinary experience that led the social-democratic thinker Michael Harrington
to walk out of the 1962 SDS summit at Port Huron in disgust. The same abstract
contempt has helped to disable American liberalism. Yet in <i>The Politics of
Meaning</i>, Lerner recommends that courses be given throughout public high
school in "the history of domination of consciousness." Lerner never 
learns. <p>
<br>

<font size=5>T</font>HE press attacked Lerner (and also gave him forum after forum), the Clintons
dropped him, and the press forgot him. Out of that humiliated sensibility comes
<i>The Politics of Meaning</i>.<p>
There is not much to say about this sad book, an unreadable compendium of
gaseous bromides that Lerner has been repeating for ten years. The overall
effect is of an oversized, appallingly written and conceived brochure for a
socio-politico-cosmic vacation. <p>
<br>

<blockquote>Instead of thinking of a politics-of-meaning society as one in which people are
going to be excessively focussed on wondering about their duty, we can picture
it as one in which people will be so excited to be meeting one other and having
the opportunity to spend time together that we will resemble playful puppies,
joyfully exploring and celebrating each other's existence.</blockquote><br>

<blockequote><blockquote>Another dignity-restoring mechanism would be to encourage residents of nursing
homes to hold memorial services for residents who have passed 
away.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>If [children] are emotionally or physically brutalized . . . we are all likely
to suffer the consequences--whether in random acts of violence or in ethically
insensitive voting behavior.</blockquote><p>

<blockquote>Indeed, we might eventually ask whether there really is such a thing as "the
physical world," or whether that concept itself is merely an attempt to
abstract reality from its essential spiritual, ethical, and material
interconnectedness.</blockquote> <p>

<blockquote>Men are often so alienated from their own bodies that many have no idea how much
more delicious and stimulating a meaning-based sexuality can 
be.</blockquote> <p>

As his public fortunes have fallen, Lerner has disappeared into his own ego. He
is doing the work of Onan, not Moses. <p>
<br>

<font size=5>G</font>IVEN his mental convolutions, it's impossible to resist applying Lerner's
cherished psychologizing to Lerner himself. An analysis would go like this. The
people Lerner "treated" at his Institute for Labor and Mental Health were
working-class and middle-class. That is, they were members of the "silent
majority" who had once rejected Lerner's calls for revolutionary action. So for
two decades Lerner got back his own. His patients might reasonably have thought
he was trying to help them; but Lerner had another agenda. He tells us that his
"aim was to better understand the psychodynamics of middle-income working
people, and also to try to understand why so many of them were moving to the
political Right." And the findings of his research with the people who put
themselves in his care were that they had been deformed by pain and
misrecognition, maimed by the "deprivation of meaning." In other words, it was
<i>their fault </i>that the revolution had failed and propelled Lerner into
twenty years of oblivion, not his. <i>They </i>had failed <i>him</i>. This
project of self-vindication has been at the "meaning" core of his ambitions
since before Lerner was seduced and then abandoned by the Clintons and lost the
media spotlight. Now, as an indifferent society once again rejects Lerner's
calls for transformation, the self-vindication remains.<p>

Let all this infuriated healing come to an end.

<blockquote>


<font size=5>T</font>he story of the <A 
HREF="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rosario/music/bso.html">Boston Symphony 
Orchestra</A>'s new Seiji Ozawa Hall, at Tanglewood, in western 
Massachusetts, reads like a Hollywood movie--a movie by <A 
HREF="http://us2.imdb.com/M/person-exact?Capra,%20Frank">Frank Capra,</A> 
not <A HREF="http://us2.imdb.com/M/person-exact?Stone,%20Oliver">Oliver 
Stone.</A> A famous big-city symphony orchestra decides to build a new 
concert hall at its rural summer facility, in addition to the one where the 
full orchestra performs.  This hall will accommodate students, serve as a 
summer recording studio, and, most of all, be a perfect place to hear 
chamber music, small ensembles, and the student orchestra.  An architect 
must be found to create a beautiful building--one that not only looks good 
but also sounds good.  A list of prospective architects is drawn up.  It 
consists of the most celebrated practitioners in the country and, because 
this is an orchestra that believes in blind auditions for unseasoned 
musicians, several young up-and-comers.  Finally seven architects are 
invited to be interviewed.  (Here is an opportunity for several cameo 
roles.  Let us cast <A 
HREF="http://us2.imdb.com/M/person-exact?Dennehy,%20Brian">Brian 
Dennehy,</a> who was the convincing star of <A 
HREF="http://us2.imdb.com/M/person-exact?Greenaway,%20Peter">Peter 
Greenaway's</A> <I><A 
HREF="http://us2.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Belly%20of%20an%20architect,%20 
The">The Belly of an Architect</A></I>, and <A 
HREF="http://us2.imdb.com/M/person-exact?Gere,%20Richard">Richard Gere,</A> 
who also once wielded a T square on film.) Gruff and rumpled, handsome and 
Armani-suited, the architects make their presentations to the orchestra 
committee, displaying portfolios bulging with photographs of impressive 
museums, dramatic corporate headquarters, and, of course, eye-popping 
concert halls.  <P> Surprisingly, one of the unseasoned newcomers is among 
the chosen seven.  (<A 
HREF="http://us2.imdb.com/M/person-exact?Hanks,%20Tom">Tom Hanks</A> has 
the <A HREF="http://us2.imdb.com/M/person-exact?Stewart,%20James">Jimmy 
Stewart</A> role.) He is hampered by never having built a concert hall, so 
he shows his latest project instead--affordable housing on the waterfront.  
Then he makes a fervent speech about the rural site of the new hall--its 
landscape, its spirit, its ambiance.  He talks about the kind of building 
he thinks the orchestra needs: open, informal, yet reflecting the intensity 
of the music.  It shouldn't overpower the place, he warns, and he calls it 
a background building.  (This is a fine set piece: the earnest and 
impassioned architect confronting the attentive but skeptical committee of 
civic leaders, retired businessmen, and wealthy socialites.) Finally our 
hero returns to his office.  He is dejected.  The committee appeared 
interested, but what chance does he have against the architectural 
stars?<P> Meanwhile, everyone on the symphony committee has his or her own 
favorites.  The chairman suggests an informal poll, with each member 
writing two names on a slip of paper.  When the ballots are read, there is 
general surprise at the discovery that only one candidate appears as the 
first or second choice on every single ballot: Hanks.  After more 
deliberation the final choice is made.  It is, of course, our hero.  As in 
every Capra movie, the outcome is predictable, but that's the appeal.<P> 
The architect travels to Europe to visit famous concert halls.  Together 
with the acoustician (<A 
HREF="http://us2.imdb.com/M/person-exact?Grodin,%20Charles">Charles 
Grodin</A> in the co-starring role), he develops a design.  The building 
goes up.  It certainly looks impressive, but how will it sound?  After the 
rehearsal the musicians seem happy.  It's going to be fine, Grodin says.  
But that prognosis is based on an empty hall--how will it sound with an 
audience at the opening gala?  More to the point, how will it sound to 
influential music critics?  Cut to opening night, when we see the critic 
for <I>The New York Times</I> among the concertgoers (Edward Rothstein 
plays himself).  The music starts.  The critic sits concentrating intently, 
his brow furrowed.  He looks slightly irritated.  During the intermission 
he gets up and moves to another seat.  We start to get nervous--will this 
be a movie with a fashionably unhappy ending?  <P> The next day Hanks and 
Grodin read Rothstein's review.  "Precisely what a concert hall should be," 
Rothstein writes.  "It is rare for a new hall to begin its career with such 
a mature, seasoned character." The movie ends with a reprise of the closing 
of the gala concert and the music of Randall Thompson's <I>Alleluia</I>, an 
unaccompanied chorus with the audience joining in.  The camera pulls back 
from the stage, across the heads of the singing people, and through the 
great doors at the rear of the hall to the outside lawn, where more people 
sit and sprawl on the grass.  As the camera rises, we see the dark 
silhouettes of the rolling hills on the horizon.  Below us the warm glow of 
the light spilling out the doors identifies the concert hall.  The patch of 
light glows smaller as the credits begin to roll.<P> The critical reception 
of the acoustical qualities of Seiji Ozawa Hall, designed by the architect 
William L.  Rawn III, has been consistently favorable, although Rothstein 
did have a quibble about "too much being shaved off the top frequencies." 
After the first season the hall's acoustician, R.  Lawrence Kirkegaard, 
ordered the removal of an eighth of an inch of the absorptive cellulose 
fiber that covered the ceiling, and the sound was judged to be improved.  
Such tinkering is not uncommon in a new hall.  What is unusual is for the 
sound of a new concert hall to be so widely praised: the reaction to new 
halls has frequently been lukewarm if not downright hostile.  It is usually 
the old halls that are loved and admired.<P> A case in point is Boston's 
Symphony Hall, which is generally held to be the first hall in whose design 
the <A 
HREF="http://www.cf.ac.uk/uwcc/archi/howshall/studio/dissert/history.html">science 
of acoustics</A> played a role.  It was built at the turn of the twentieth 
century and designed by the great architectural firm of McKim, Mead and 
White, working in their full-blown Italian Renaissance mode and with the 
assistance of Wallace Clement Sabine, a professor of physics at Harvard and 
the father of modern architectural acoustics.  The music critic for the 
Boston <I>Evening Transcript</I> was not impressed, however: after the 
inaugural concert he wrote that "the tone was beautifully smooth .  .  .  
but it had no life, there was nothing commanding and compelling about it." 
Nevertheless, Symphony Hall has become known precisely for its exceptional 
sound.  "Even the first time that I conducted there, I was struck by its 
acoustics," Bruno Walter said thirty-five years ago.  "It is the most noble 
of American concert halls." Herbert von Karajan was still more effusive, 
going so far as to say that Symphony Hall was better for much music than 
the Grosser Musikvereinssaal, in Vienna--considered by many to be the best 
hall in the world.<P> Of course, "the best hall in the world" is a slippery 
concept, since settings for music have changed considerably over time--as 
has music itself.  Baroque orchestral music was played in small rooms that 
had a relatively short (less than 1.5 seconds) "reverberation time"--the 
length of time that sound gives the impression of lingering as a result of 
being reflected by hard surfaces.  Short reverberation times are ideal for 
intimate and highly defined music.  Sacred music, such as Bach's early 
fugues, was often written to be performed in small private chapels whose 
reverberation times were relatively short.  Some choral works, on the other 
hand, were staged in larger churches, and took advantage of the more 
reverberative spaces.  During the Classical period the music of Haydn and 
Mozart was performed in what were the first concert halls.  Although these 
halls were small by modern standards, and sat only several hundred people, 
the reverberation times were longer than those in private chapels--1.5 to 
1.7 seconds.  The popularity of orchestral music during the second half of 
the nineteenth century brought a new generation of larger concert halls.  
The Musikvereinssaal, for example, opened in 1870 and has 1,680 seats.  
Such halls have longer reverberation times (1.9 to 2.2 seconds), with 
fuller tones but slightly lower definition, which complements the music of 
Romantic composers like Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and Richard Strauss.  <P> The 
music of the twentieth century is more varied in its demands, and any hall 
in which the work of composers ranging from Bach to G&oacute;recki is 
performed requires a compromise.  Nevertheless, there is a surprising 
amount of agreement about which are the best-sounding concert halls.  Most 
musicians, critics, and concertgoers would probably include not only 
Vienna's Musikvereinssaal and Boston's Symphony Hall but also Amsterdam's 
Concertgebouw and New York's Carnegie Hall.  A systematic study of these 
and other halls is contained in the recently published <I><A 
HREF="http://www.aip.org/aippress/newtitles/titles/concert_and_opera_halls.html">Concert 
and Opera Halls: How They Sound</A></I>, a vastly revised and enlarged

Bernstein,</A> Von Karajan, and Walter.  Eugene Ormandy told him, "In my 
many years as a conductor, this is the first time anyone has come to me to 
ask my opinion about acoustics." Beranek accorded his top rating, 
"superior," to only the Musikvereinssaal, Symphony Hall, and the 
Concertgebouw.  He described an additional six concert halls as 
"excellent": Basel's Stadt-Casino, Berlin's Konzerthaus (formerly 
Schauspielhaus), Cardiff's St.  David's Hall, New York's Carnegie Hall, 
Tokyo's Hamarikyu Asahi, and Zurich's Grosser Tonhallesaal.  The rest of 
the halls he consigned to lesser categories, although he was diplomatic 
enough not to give a detailed ranking.  <P> Why do old halls sound better 
than new ones?  To a large extent it is a question of shape.  <A 
HREF="http://www.cf.ac.uk/uwcc/archi/howshall/studio/dissert/forms.html">The 
Musikvereinssaal (1870), the Concertgebouw (1888), and Symphony Hall (1900) 
all have a shoebox shape, and so do four of the six halls in the 
"excellent" category.</A> (St.  David's Hall is hexagonal in plan, and 
Carnegie Hall is rectangular but not a traditional shoebox.) In a typical 
shoebox the orchestra is at one end, and the seats are on the floor and in 
one gallery extending along the sides and across the opposite end.  Sound 
is reflected to the listener from the two long sides, which are about sixty 
to eighty feet apart, and also from the ceiling.  Because the concertgoer 
is relatively close to the musicians, the atmosphere is intimate, visually 
and acoustically.  <P> The majority of concert halls built during the 
twentieth century have departed from the successful shoebox formula.  Why?  
One reason is a need for greater seating capacity; another is higher 
standards of comfort and safety.  Basel's Stadt-Casino has only 1,448 
seats.  Many contemporary concert halls, especially in America, where 
orchestras rely more on box-office receipts than on government subsidies, 
approach 3,000.  To bring the rear seats closer to the stage, halls have 
been made wider or fan-shaped.  This sacrifices some of the acoustical 
qualities of the shoebox, especially the ability to reflect bass notes from 
the side walls.  Audience capacity may not, however, be the main reason for 
the change.  After all, Symphony Hall, the largest of the shoeboxes, 
accommodates as many as 2,625 concertgoers--about the same as Lincoln 
Center's Philharmonic Hall, which opened in 1962, and which had an 
untraditional shape.  So perhaps architects' willful desire to reinvent the 
wheel is also part of the explanation.<P> Because Ozawa Hall was to be 
small --seating was not to exceed 1,200--it could follow the tried-and-true 
models.  "The shoebox shape was identified very early," says Kirkegaard, 
who trained at Harvard as an architect and was the acoustician responsible 
for the 1989 corrections to the 1986 remodeling of Carnegie Hall.  He 
apprenticed with Bolt, Beranek and Newman at the time the firm was 
struggling with the acoustical shortcomings of Philharmonic Hall.  (The 
sound in Philharmonic Hall proved so bad that the interior was gutted and 
Avery Fisher Hall, a classic shoebox, was put in its place.) "The Boston 
Symphony musicians love their hall, and all their favorite concert halls 
were that shape," Kirkegaard says.  On his European tour Rawn was 
especially impressed by the architectural presence of the Musikvereinssaal 
and Berlin's Konzerthaus, another nineteenth-century shoebox, designed by 
the great neoclassical architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel (and rebuilt to 
the original plans after the Second World War).  Ozawa Hall is seventy feet 
wide, 140 feet long, and fifty feet high, about the same size as the 
Musikvereinssaal; it has two side balconies, like Symphony Hall.  One 
feature of Ozawa Hall is unique: much of the rear wall consists of doors 
that slide open, permitting another 2,000 concertgoers to listen to the 
music on the gently sloping lawn outside, thanks to a sophisticated sound 
system that mirrors the hall's acoustics for the outdoor listeners.<P> 
<I>Concert and Opera Halls</I> concludes with three general observations: 
small halls generally sound better than large halls; halls built for a 
single purpose are superior to multi-purpose halls; and old halls sound 
better than new ones.  These observations obviously influenced the design 
of Seiji Ozawa Hall.  The new hall was being built as a replacement for a 
wooden structure called The Theatre, built in 1941 to a design by Eliel and 
Eero Saarinen.  The Theatre had served for both opera and concert music; 
since 1962 it had been used only for rehearsal.  The initial plan was to 
accommodate both types of programming.  However, "as the design progressed, 
Bill Rawn slowly but firmly steered us to the conviction that a hall 
designed uniquely for concert music was the best solution," Daniel R.  
Gustin, the manager of Tanglewood, recalls.  This avoided the 
complexity--and the cost--of an orchestra pit, a room for scenery, and 
other backstage facilities.  (Some of the funding was diverted toward 
restoring The Theatre, so that opera can be staged there.) And, as we shall 
see, a concert hall can benefit from the lack of a proscenium stage.<P> 
Another lesson that old concert halls teach concerns construction.  Their 
walls and ceilings were usually plaster applied directly to heavy brick or 
stone; there was relatively little wood.  Massive walls sustain a 
low-frequency bass response, unlike hollow walls and lightweight wood 
paneling, which tend to reflect only the treble notes.  Although the 
interior of Ozawa Hall has a lot of <A 
HREF="http://www.woodweb.com/backart/cwb/cwbwami.html">exposed wood 
(teak),</A> it is confined to the seats and the balcony railings; the walls 
are stucco over very thick masonry, and the ceiling consists of heavy 
concrete coffers.  The result is, as Rothstein put it in his review, "a 
resonant, warm space that comes to life with sound."<P> The enjoyment of 
music in a concert hall is not only the auditory result of construction, 
dimensions, and shape.  Architecture, too, plays an important role.  If the 
new hall is traditional in its overall internal arrangement, it is much 
less so in its decor: Rawn's respect for the past does not extend to the 
use of classical architectural language.  There is no figurative ornament 
here, no statuary as in Symphony Hall, no caryatids supporting the 
balconies as in the Musikvereinssaal, no crystal chandeliers as in the 
Stadt-Casino.  But neither is this a cold, abstract modernist interior, 
like the recently constructed Op&eacute;ra Bastille in Paris, of which the 
soprano June Anderson has said, "The place looks like a gymnasium." <P> 
Ozawa Hall certainly doesn't look like a gymnasium.  Some have likened it 
to a Quaker meetinghouse or a New England town hall.  There is certainly an 
air of gathering here.  In doing away with the proscenium that is common to 
so many American concert halls, pulling the stage into the main body of the 
hall, and in placing some of the audience beside and even behind the 
musicians (as at the Concertgebouw), Rawn has given concertgoers the 
feeling of being participants.  The teak grilles that make up the balcony 
railings remind me of yacht gratings, and the seats, which are mainly 
movable chairs, recall the deck furniture on a cruise ship.  If this is a 
Quaker meetinghouse--and there is a sense of artlessness in the 
unembellished forms--it is one whose frugality is tempered by hints of 
boating, and leisure, and summer vacations.  My only quibble is that the 
decor is almost too refined: one misses the makeshift, camplike quality of 
the other buildings at Tanglewood.<P> The exterior shape of the building 
recalls Symphony Hall, except that the roof is gently curved instead of 
pitched and the lower flanking wings have open porches instead of solid 
walls.  Because the main hall is brick and the structure of the porches is 
heavy timber (recycled from old wharves and trestle bridges), the overall 
effect is of an industrial building--a nineteenth-century mill, say, of the 
kind that one can still see in many small Massachusetts towns.  That sounds 
unusual, but Tanglewood itself is an odd combination of urban culture and 
country setting, of intensity and informality.<P> When I visited Bill 
Rawn's office, in downtown Boston, he showed me one of the sketchbooks he 
kept during his European tour of concert halls.  Now, many architects keep 
such visual diaries.  What struck me about Rawn's sketchbook was that 
although it contained the usual thumbnail drawings, there were also pages 
and pages of written notes.  Obviously he had been looking and listening, 
but he had also been thinking.  Contemporary architecture can represent a 
range of qualities: refinement, excitement--even, in the case of much 
deconstructivist work, angst.  It is rare, however, to come across an 
architect whose work can be described, first and foremost, as intelligent.  
I think this is probably what impressed the Boston Symphony Orchestra 
committee, and led them to make a choice that must have seemed risky at the 
time.  A bold client, an intelligent architect, and a perceptive 
acoustician--that is a Hollywood script indeed.  </blockquote><p>

Dear Sisters,<p>



I say at the outset that I do not want him. This is my daughter Margaret's

idea, most entirely and emphatically hers. She learned of you and your good

work from Father Thomas J. McCormick, at St. Michael's Church, in Mineral

Point, Wisconsin. Father McCormick recently visited your establishment, and

spoke about it to the parish youth group. Margaret, her father, and I discussed

the acquisition of a child in a most cursory manner, and without our consent or

encouragement--indeed, without even our knowledge--she proceeded to write the

required letters, falsely, over her father's forged signature. It pains me

greatly to admit that my daughter is capable of such duplicity, even when the

ostensible cause is worthy and charitable. And yet, it is true.<p>



And then, most unexpectedly, at dinner yesterday evening she announced that a

young boy is coming to us from New York City. Her tone and manner were so calm

and unimpassioned that had I not paid heed, I might well have thought she had

done no more than state her admiration for a new bonnet in Kaufmann's window on

Main Street.<p>





<A HREF="./nunbig.htm"><IMG SRC="./nun.gif" ALT=" " ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="325" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"></A>



Do not think me hard of heart or uncaring, Sisters, but at fifty-three I am an

old woman and not well. We are far from wealthy. The farm provides for our

needs but allows no excess. Of my five living children, three are grown and

gone. Patrick, the oldest, lives with us still, as does Margaret, the youngest,

age thirteen. She is eager for this boy you are sending us. She says that she

will tend to him and that I will not even know he is here. But I have my

doubts. My husband, when he spoke of it at all, pressed for an older boy,

someone to help with the chores. When he understood that the one you selected

for us is only four years of age, he lost whatever small curiosity he possessed

in the matter. So I fear that the burden of this child will fall heavily upon

me, and frankly, good Sisters, I shall not shoulder it.<p>



I spoke to Father McCormick today after High Mass. He urged me to write to you

to withdraw Margaret's request for the child. That, as you must surmise, is the

motive that prompts this letter. So if the boy has not yet left your admirable

care, then keep him until a more willing and suitable family stakes its claim

to him. If, on the other hand, he has already departed, please let me know when

he will arrive, so that I can make adequate preparations. Father McCormick

explained that should this missive arrive after the boy has left, we can send

him back to you at the end of summer. Or, if you prefer, we can dispatch him to

another home, at no expense to us. Please confirm this for me. I assure you,

Sisters, that should the boy be on his way, I will attempt to care for him to

the utmost of my abilities. All things are worth trying, so I will try this

child, but for the summer only. Do bear in mind the probability of his return,

since at this moment I do not want him.<p>



I eagerly await your reply.<p>



<p>



Most sincerely,<br>



Mrs. Thomas O'Brien (Constance)<p>

<p>



My Dear Mrs. O'Brien,<p>



Thank you for your letter dated April 30th. It is my great pleasure to tell you

that I do so trust in your goodness and generosity that despite your

understandable misgivings, the boy is coming to you soon. I myself will put him

on the train in three days' time, Wednesday, May 10. We will travel by the noon

ferry to Jersey City, where Albert Joseph--that is his name--will board the

Pennsylvania Railroad No. 5 (<i>The Pennsylvania Limited</i>) at quarter past

twelve. He will arrive in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at twenty minutes past

two o'clock in the afternoon, and then at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at half

past eleven that night. After a ten-minute stopover he will leave Pittsburgh

and arrive in Fort Wayne, Indiana, at twenty minutes to eight o'clock on the

morning of Thursday, May 11. He will then travel to Chicago, Illinois, where he

will arrive at twelve o'clock noon on that same day. At that juncture he will

transfer to the Illinois Central Railroad, leave Chicago at quarter past one

P.M., and arrive in Freeport, Illinois, at five o'clock in the evening. His

train will depart Freeport twenty minutes later and will arrive in Dodgeville,

Wisconsin, at twenty minutes to eight P.M., still on Thursday, May 11. I am

told that Dodgeville is eighteen miles from Highland, so please arrange to be

there to meet his train.<p>



The weather here is warm, so I will dress him lightly in a double-breasted wool

jacket--which I believe will be useful to him in time to come (it now quite

overwhelms him). He will also wear long cuffed trousers, a white cotton shirt,

and good leather shoes. I do not know what the spring season will bring to

Wisconsin, though I am told it is much like here, only colder.<p>



He will have one change of clean underthings in a brown paper bag. In another

bag he will have two sandwiches--cheese on rye bread, his favorite--and various

fruits. For your future information, Mrs. O'Brien, Albert refuses to eat meat.

Perhaps you can break him of this strange and frustrating habit. I tried

diligently but failed.<p>



He will be accompanied on his journey by a Miss Clare Connelly, age eleven. I

know Miss Connelly to be an outstandingly responsible and capable young girl,

as she has been with us since birth. Do not worry, Mrs. O'Brien. She will care

for Albert Joseph as would any young woman twice her age. She has helped

frequently with infants, many much younger than Albert, who, at four, is

himself more reasonable and clear-thinking than you could possibly imagine.<p>



My only concern is that as Miss Connelly will have to leave the train at

Chicago, Illinois, to begin her own new life with a family there, Albert may be

left to travel alone from Chicago to Dodgeville. Miss Connelly will see that he

transfers safely from the Pennsylvania Railroad to the Illinois Central

Railroad, and I will instruct her to find someone on the latter train to care

for Albert after her departure. Perhaps a conductor will attend to him. We must

trust in God's Will in such matters and pray for the best.<p>



I will also attach notes to Albert's person, for anyone curious enough to look.

I will place these notes in his pockets. Further, I have sewn your name and the

words "Highland Wisco" into the hem of his jacket sleeve at the right wrist. I

used a sturdy white thread. I will label him as best I can. He knows his own

name and yours and has been told to ask for you.<p>



You will recognize him immediately, Mrs. O'Brien, for he is a beautiful, bright

boy, with not the slightest penchant for naughtiness. I am confident that you,

your husband, and your generous (if somewhat mischievous!) daughter Margaret

will quickly come to love him, as I do, for he is no trouble and readily learns

new tasks.<p>



I will now describe his physical appearance to help you identify him at the

railway station in Dodgeville. He has fine fair hair, very straight. His eyes

are blue with a slight greenish cast. His features are even and delicate.

Indeed, I consider his an almost angelic visage. Further, his teeth, legs, and

back are straight and strong, and his lungs healthy. He speaks very little, but

understands everything. He has a thoughtful, sober demeanor, and yet a quick

and easy smile. He is not in the least bit childish, despite his four short

years on this Earth. His religious development is most impressive, imbuing him

with a touching and genuine piety. He knows several prayers, including The Hail

Mary, The Our Father, The Glory Be, and certain lengthy sections of The

Apostles' Creed. He stands thirty-seven inches and weighs thirty-five pounds.

He is small for his age, a condition I attribute to his diet. I pray that the

fresh air of Wisconsin will stimulate his appetite and correct what is his only

peculiarity.<p>



I close this letter with the fervent hope that I will hear good news from you

soon. Please write to me with questions, observations, and information, for I

love Albert Joseph. If, indeed, it is not unseemly for me to say so, I love him

as I would my own fleshly son, had God allowed it.<p>



I pray that Jesus Christ, His saints--of whom, Mrs. O'Brien, I believe you are

one--and His loving Blessed Virgin Mother, Mary, will grant you and your fine

family all manner of grace, strength, and happiness.<p>

New York City<br>



<p>



Dear Sister Jeanne-Marie Clotilde,<p>



The boy arrived, as you said he would. We had no choice but to

meet him, as you seemed indifferent to the misgivings and requests I expressed

in my letter of April 30th. Forgive me for saying so, Sister, but by ignoring

my words you did this child a grave disservice. As is the case with all

children, this boy belongs in a home that welcomes him, not in one that feels

duped into accepting him.<p>



Further, you have done me an injustice. As stated in my previous letter, I am

not a well woman. At the risk of embarrassing you, I will be blunt. Six months

ago I lost my breasts to cancer and the surgeon's knife. With them went the

last remnants of my maternal urge. Subsequently I have endured great agitation

in my mind and spirit, and have often pondered the value of my place here on

earth. Further, and much to my shame, I sought relief in hard drink and for a

time imagined I was carrying a child, although I knew this was impossible.

Thankfully, all that has passed, and my thoughts are now at peace with whatever

God's Mercy holds in store for me.<p>



I deeply resent, however, the responsibility you have thrust upon me to care

for this poor boy. I have borne seven children to full term in my lifetime. Two

of them died, one immediately from a misshapen head, and the other at the age

of two, from diphtheria. I have done my duty to God and to my husband, Sister,

and I do not believe I should be called upon to do even more, now, with the

appearance of this child. Further, I worked as a teacher for six years before

marriage, thereby contributing to the good of many young children. And,

finally, my disease is certain to return in the near future. I accept this fact

as God's Will. When that day comes, however, what will become of this small,

dependent child? My husband is not inclined to rear him, and Margaret will have

to begin her own life unencumbered by the liabilities and responsibilities of a

young brother for whom she must care.<p>



Nevertheless, he is here, and as you wrote, he is a beautiful child. Thus I

will be kind to this boy and will attempt to the best of my abilities to care

for him this summer. But my heart, Sister, is not in it, and the heart, I

believe, is crucial to the proper rearing of children. <p>



Further, in these past two days he has shown evidence of being a troubling

child, even taking into consideration the strain of his journey and the

confusion and fright that his new surroundings must surely engender in his

young imagination. For his entire first night under our roof he sat on the edge

of his bed as still as ice. If he slept at all, he did so bolt upright. He

would not allow us to remove his clothing and dress him for sleep, nor would he

speak to us. The following morning he ate but little, just milk and one fried

egg, and throughout the day he did not stir, but sat staring out the window at

the barn. To this day he has refused to change his clothing and has said

nothing comprehensible.<p>



At present I feel at sea in my exchanges with him, and worry that he may

possess some deficiency or lapse that can lead only to disaster. I must know

more about this child. If you have any additional information, please send it

to me promptly. I would like to know something of his parentage. And what is

his birth date?<p>



I await your speedy reply.<p>



<p>



Sincerely yours,<br>



Constance O'Brien<br>

Sunday, May 21, 1893<br>



<p>



Dear Mrs. O'Brien,<p>



Two whole days were required that I might absorb the powerful effects of your

most recent letter. I did not, of course, know of your illness, nor did I

understand your sorrows. I truly beg your pardon, Mrs. O'Brien, and pray

fervently for your health, in spirit, mind, and body.<p>



In response I can state only that life in this city is desperately cruel for

children like Albert. The streets teem with unwanted boys and girls. Whole

families die of diseases like typhoid, cholera, and influenza, leaving behind

one or two small survivors to fend for themselves. These are castaways, adrift

on the world's harsh and heartless sea. We struggle to find homes for these

children--to bring them to the safe shore of God's eternal love--and in our

eagerness we sometimes err. Still, my dear Mrs. O'Brien, if you could only see

what a great service you have performed by taking Albert under your roof! You

have given him what all children need--a family! And you have allowed us to

take in yet another child, one who would have slept in doorways or on hay

barges had you not accepted Albert into your home. Further, life in Wisconsin,

with its clean water and sweet, stimulating air, will surely benefit Albert

immeasurably more than life in this city of pestilence and pain.<p>



To answer your questions, we know little of Albert's parental history. He came

to us in a basket left at our back door during the early-morning hours of

Sunday, September 11, 1888. He was fully clothed and seemingly well tended. A

five-dollar bill and a handwritten note accompanied him. I have the note in

front of me and will copy it here, exactly as written:<p>



<p>



<i>Dear Sisters,</i><p>



<i>Please take care of my baby boy. I love him but can not feed and cloth him.

He is not illegal. His name is Albert Joseph and he was Baptized by an Irish

preest. He is now four months of age.</i><p>



<i>Thank you Sisters and God bless You All,</i><br>



<i>	the Sad Mother of Albert</i><br>



<i></i><p>



<p>



Based on this information, we dated his birth at approximately May 11, 1888,

which would mean that he arrived at your home on his fifth birthday, exactly.

Believe me, Mrs. O'Brien, I did not plan this. It is the sheerest of fate's

coincidences, and I realize it only now, as I write it to you. And yet if seen

from our Savior's Point of View, it may not be coincidence at all but a fine

thread in the Tapestry of His Father's Wondrous Plan. <p>



I have been especially close to Albert, for I arrived at the Foundling Hospital

from our Mother House in Quebec, Canada, on September 1, 1888, just ten days

before he arrived. I nursed him through two serious illnesses, including

scarlet fever. During our time together I taught him several French words,

which he now uses with a child's disarming and often apt carelessness. For

example, Albert and I traveled by livery to the ferry in Jersey City on the day

of his recent departure. He was elated to begin his new life in Highland,

Wisconsin, and, as is typical of him, he felt a great affinity for the horse

that drew our carriage. He pointed to the horse's ears and called them

"piquant," a word I recently taught him. I thought it a fine application of a

difficult word. (Oh, Mrs. O'Brien: I was most heartened to learn that you were

once a teacher. After entering the convent I, too, was trained to teach, and

found the shaping of young minds the most gratifying of all the work God has

asked of me.)<p>



I hope this information will be of some assistance to you. I acknowledge its

inadequacy, but it is all I have. I eagerly await your next correspondence.

Does Albert continue to refuse to consume meat? And has he ever asked after me?

<p>



I will remember you in my prayers.<p>



<p>



Most sincerely yours in Christ our Savior,<br>

Dear Sister Jeanne-Marie,<p>



Much has transpired in the nearly two weeks since I opened your last letter. I

have found it puzzling and difficult knowing so little about this boy and yet

feeling such responsibility for his well-being. With my children I could always

draw a line from their actions to those of other persons in our family. When

Liam began to stutter, I remembered that my uncle Homer was similarly

afflicted. When Timothy developed a limp, I recalled that my mother's second

cousin, Walter, was likewise crippled. And when Patrick began to show signs of

feeblemindedness, I remembered that my father's uncle Aaron spent the last nine

years of his life at the Wisconsin State Hospital for the Insane. But with

Albert everything is unprecedented and inexplicable.<p>



As one example, Sister, can you tell me: Was Albert ever prone to theft? In the

past several days he has acted in a way that is quite unsettling to all of us.

It began after Mass on Sunday, May 21. We returned from church, hungry from

fasting, and I began to prepare our breakfast. I sent Patrick to the henhouse

to fetch some eggs. He returned empty-handed. Believing he had misunderstood, I

sent him back. Again he returned without a single egg. So I went to the

henhouse myself and, much to my astonishment, found not one egg, which is most

strange, as our hens are fertile and reliable. My husband was as abashed as I.

Later that day, as I was putting clean clothes into drawers, I made a most

astonishing discovery. There, nestled in each of our drawers, was a cluster of

chicken eggs, tucked in the corner and covered lightly with our clothing. Still

later I discovered the hogs' feed in the horses' stalls, and the horses' oats

in the henhouse.<p>



When I asked Albert if he knew anything about this strange confusion, he

quickly admitted to all of it. He said he was "putting things at home" (his

exact words), and claimed that the animals should share their food. Other

occurrences have continued this theme. I found my hairbrush in the hayloft, for

example, and my husband's favorite hat in the hogs' trough.<p>



Still other objects remain missing: my best linen handkerchief, for one;

Patrick's dress collar and cloth umbrella; and my husband's Missal. Albert

makes no attempt to deny responsibility, and my husband believes that corporal

punishment is the only means of breaking such potentially illegal habits. So

now, each time an object disappears, Thomas gets out his belt and strikes

Albert several times across the behind.<p>



I myself do not agree with such methods, but my husband is a strong man, having

marched to the sea with General William T. Sherman's Union Army some thirty

years ago. Although I did not know him then, I believe his participation in the

burning of Atlanta, Georgia, and the rude destruction of property and livestock

along the way hardened his heart and stilled the gentler aspects of his

nature.<p>



And yet another strange occurrence requires your clarification. Yesterday

morning my husband and I were in the barn feeding the horses. Albert had

accompanied us, as he seems to take particular delight in watching the animals

eat. At some point in the conversation occurring between us, my husband

commented on our prize horse, Sassy, calling her a "grand mare." With that

Albert began to laugh uncontrollably and insisted that Sassy was not a grand

mare, but that I was. He repeated this sentiment with great conviction,

pointing at me and insisting that I was a grand mare. As he speaks rarely, this

outburst was so out of character as to be shocking. I cannot understand the

import of this puzzling incident, and I wonder about Albert's mental stability

if he could, as he did, maintain in the face of all logic and common sense that

I was a horse.<p>



In response to your questions, Albert is adamant in his refusal to eat meat.

His stubbornness is annoying, and I am fearful that his growth will be stunted

permanently. Further, he grew quite beside himself recently when he witnessed

my husband killing a chicken for supper. The chicken ran around the yard for

some few moments after its head was removed, as is natural for chickens.

Albert, however, screaming piteously, grabbed the decapitated head from off the

tree stump and scurried after the chicken like a banshee, begging the dead

animal to stop so that he could "fix" it. The event was so unexpected that all

we could do was laugh. Later that night I watched Albert sneak out to the

rabbit hutch, open the door, lift one of the rabbits to the ground, and stomp

his feet, as if to frighten the rabbit away. The rabbit, however, accustomed to

people, simply stood there until I arrived and put it back into the hutch. My

husband and I feel Albert's behavior is unnatural. We will try to correct it.<p>



Albert asks for you frequently and I explain that you are far away. Please

write soon with any comments or observations that will help us better

understand Albert's unique personality.<p>

<p>



My Dear Constance,<p>



Your most interesting letter of June 9th is received. May the Lord reward you a

thousandfold for the kindness and patience you are showing dear Albert. Your

letters are of great value to me, as I feel that despite the many miles that

separate us, Albert still holds a part of my being in his. I am glad that he

asks for me, but am sure that in your loving care he will soon forget me.<p>



Unfortunately, I cannot solve all the mysteries you pose in your letter. For

one, Albert never revealed any tendency toward theft while in my care, and I

cannot begin to explain his behavior regarding the eggs &amp; feed, etc. We do

teach the children to share their meager belongings with others here at the

Hospital, and Albert was always quick to do so. Perhaps he is simply mistaking

that lesson and applying it to the animals on your farm.<p>



Upon the incident concerning your horse I am happy to shed some light. I

believe that Albert simply misunderstood what your husband was saying when he

referred to the horse as a grand mare and heard, instead, the French word

<i>grand-m&egrave;re</i>, which means "grandmother." I am certain that he meant

this as a compliment to you, as we teach our children to honor and respect all

aspects of family, even though few of these unfortunate outcasts will ever be

part of one.<p>



I hesitate to say so, and I hope you will pardon what might be construed as

impudent, but I do hope you can persuade your good husband to desist from

corporal punishment. During my many years of working with children like Albert,

I have found that physical punishment rarely corrects undesirable behavior,

especially if the child has not yet reached the age of reason. I have read that

the mind is connected to the brain, and that the brain responds to physical

sensation in surprising ways. Pain teaches children not respect but fear, and

fear leads to numbness of mind, not to acuity, thereby rendering the mind

incapable of grasping the lesson being taught. Human nature seeks to escape

pain and to find pleasure. My belief, then, is that when physical pain is used

as a means of instruction, with each blow of the belt--with each second that

the child suffers--we lose the child's mind to the haphazard pleasures of the

imagination. The child learns the art of fancy and fantasy, not the hard lesson

of obedience, for the body is the most sordid and least reliable avenue to the

soul. The body controls the lower functions only, and the boy who attempts to

be good through fear is just as crude as the person who attempts to dance by

rote.<p>



My poor father, like your husband, was misguided in this regard, and thus I can

assure you from my own hurtful personal experience that physical punishment

leads not to comprehension but rather to a befuddled and nervous disposition.

Indeed, when I entered the convent, at age eleven, I did so not only to answer

Christ's Call and to alleviate the burden on my desperately poor family but

also because physical punishment had led me to the grotesque delusion that I

was Saint Joan of Arc, destined for martyrdom and glory. Thanks to the kindness

of the good Sisters of Charity, I slowly returned to my true self, and in that

journey learned that those who are temperate act not from fear but from habit,

and that good habits are created gradually, diligently, and lovingly. I believe

with Saint Paul, who wrote to the Corinthians, "Charity suffereth long, and is

kind." I cannot think of a higher ideal than that, nor a more efficient means

to touch a young boy's heart and alter the disorderly habits of his mind.<p>



Please forgive my remarks if you find them meddlesome.<p>



<p>

Postscript: Seeing that Albert is of such a sensitive nature, perhaps you can

protect him from the natural slaughter of animals that is a good and necessary

part of life on your farm.<p>

<p>



Dear Sister Jeanne-Marie,<p>



I am sorry if my silence caused you worry. We have suffered a trying few weeks,

and I simply could not find time to put pen to paper. Our cares seem most

weighty this summer. First, Highland is in tumult, having been invaded by

tramps whose brazenness and brutality quickly dispel whatever grain of pity one

might feel for them. They number in the scores and seem to multiply daily,

often congregating in front of taverns and other places of questionable

reputation. Countless burglaries have been attributed to them, along with

wanton destruction of property. We, thank God, have been spared, but Sam

Peterson, an acquaintance, recently suffered a dreadful loss. Tramps lured his

favorite hunting dog, a fine beagle named Lucius, into a shack, where they

skinned and gutted him, as one would dress a deer. They placed the remains,

hide intact, at Mr. Peterson's door, with a note saying "We Mean Business."

Mrs. Peterson is said to have rebuffed their demands for food and drink the

previous day. <p>



I've heard that many of these men are Germans who worked at the iron mines.

When the ore gave out some years ago, they moved to timbering. Now the trees

are gone, and they have no means of making a livelihood. So they wander from

town to town, stealing and begging. Further, three banks have closed during the

past several months, leaving many farmers penniless. Some have turned to acts

of arson to collect insurance on barns and livestock. And I understand that an

outbreak of black diphtheria has taken fifteen lives, mainly children, in the

town of Mount Horeb, just east of here. I also heard that two women--wives

deserted by the tramps in Germantown--were driven mad by want and desperation

and so took their own lives. They were found next to each other, hanging from

the same tree, and a dead infant girl was discovered in a soapbox under their

feet.<p>



These tragedies reduce our troubles to almost nothing, and yet I cannot say

that this summer is easy for us. Margaret has moved to Prairie du Chien, where

she works in the kitchen of a prosperous family. Her absence has meant more

work for me. Then our hogs developed a blight, and twelve had to be killed for

no profit. And the very next week Albert and Patrick did something quite

remarkable. According to Patrick, Albert told him to dig a large hole behind

the barn to give the horses air. Those are Albert's words exactly, as he admits

to having spoken them. Patrick complied, digging a pit some ten feet wide and

two feet deep. As this was on the south side of the barn, where we seldom have

cause to go, we did not discover the pit until it had been completed. My

husband worked hard for two days to fill the hole again, even with Patrick's

help. <p>



Naturally, both Patrick and Albert were punished for this nonsense, which

brings to mind the comments in your letter of June 16th regarding corporal

punishment. My husband and I discussed these ideas and concluded that our

experience in family matters justifies whatever course of discipline we might

pursue for Albert. Be assured, however, that any and all punishment is

administered with the correct intent. Indeed, we thought that Albert was

responding in kind, until the incident described above.<p>



Still, he is now more talkative and curious than ever. He has also gained

weight and grown noticeably and begun to take part in family activities, like

saying Grace before meals. He still refuses to eat meat, but we have accepted

this in him. His objection to meat does not appear to be a whim or an act of

contrariness on his part, but rather a manifestation of something deep in his

unfathomable character. I hope, however, that he will outgrow it. He now tends

to several of the animals on the farm, most often the cows. But we do not allow

him to witness the slaughtering.<p>



He seems content here, and I have come to appreciate even his eccentricities,

and feel healthier now than I have since before my illness. Perhaps the doctors

are wrong and the cancer will not return, and I will live to see Albert grown

and happy.<p>

Dear Constance,<p>



It is Sunday night and the children are asleep. They sleep on cots lined up

like soldiers, one close upon the other, in a large room on the fourth floor of

our Hospital. These are young children, infants to age five, so they are mixed,

boys and girls together. The night beyond the windows is hot and quiet. I sit

at a desk near the door, keeping watch. I write by candlelight. The children

often speak in their sleep, like saints speaking in tongues. One child just

spoke of a crocodile. Another talks about her dolly being lame. Two children

whisper to each other, although both appear to be sleeping soundly. And Martin

just wet the bed again. He is beginning to squirm in a miserable attempt to

make himself comfortable. I will tend to him in a moment.<p>



The bed immediately to my right is Albert's. Another child, a two-year-old

Negro girl named Pearl, sleeps there now. I should never have allowed myself to

love Albert as much as I did. I know that now. The other Sisters warned me, but

I was arrogant and ignored them. I recognize this now as a sin of pride, and I

confess it to you, Constance, rather than to a priest, for no priest could know

how serious a sin it really is. No absolution, no Act of Contrition, will ever

put it to rest.<p>



I knew Albert better than I have known any other male being on this Earth. I

took his head in my hands and felt its weight and shape. I bathed his small

body and dressed him. I cut his hair. I kissed him. I have many children here,

and still none. I am seized by melancholy, for I sense a change in your most

recent letter, and I realize that Albert's life is becoming yours, as it once

was mine.<p>



I must tend to Martin now, before his restlessness awakens the others.<p>



<p>



May You Sleep in Christ's Loving Arms Always,<br>

does not seem to mind. I will always pray for you.<p>

	<font size=5>A</font>MONG writers of the younger--which these days means

under forty--generation, David Foster Wallace has a reputation as a

wild-card savant. A fictioneer and former Harvard philosophy student, Wallace

is the author of <i>The Broom of the System</i>, a novel; <i>Girl With Curious

Hair</i>, an envelope-stretching book of stories; and, with Mark Costello, a

nonfiction work, <i>Signifying Rappers: Rap and Race in the Urban Present</i>.

He has also done some hard schooling in halfway houses and recovery programs (a

fact not irrelevant to the novel under review). His latest offering,

<i>Infinite Jest</i>, has been moving toward us like an ocean disturbance,

pushing increasingly hyperbolic rumors before it: that the author could not

stop writing; that the publisher was begging for cuts of hundreds of pages;

that it was, qua novel, a very strange piece of business altogether. Now it's

here and, yes, it <i>is</i> strange, not just in its radically cantilevered

plot conception but also in its size (more than a thousand pages, one tenth of

that bulk taking the form of endnotes): this, mind you, in an era when

publishers express very real doubts about whether the younger

generation--presumably a good part of Wallace's target audience--reads at 

all.<p>







<A HREF="./jesterb.htm"><img src="./jester.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="" border=0></A>







<i>Infinite Jest</i>. What is it, and where has it come from?Let me try the

second question first. About four years ago Wallace published a vividly

idiosyncratic autobiographical essay in <i>Harper's</i>. "Tennis, Trigonometry,

Tornadoes" gave an account of the author's youthful obsession with tennis and

also conjured an intriguing metaphysics, bringing together the grid of the

court, the larger grid of the Illinois farm country where Wallace grew up, and

the vagaries of the mighty weather systems that move like free will through

those precincts of determinism. "Between the ages of twelve and fifteen,"

Wallace wrote, "I was a near great junior tennis player. . . . At fourteen I

was ranked seventeenth in the United States Tennis Association's Western

Section&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." Later he recalled his intensely rivalrous

friendship with one Gil Antitoi, the son of a professor of Qu&eacute;becois

history. Details, details--but it is sometimes by way of details and their

transformation that we understand a bit more about the alchemist's retort that

is the writer's imagination. How else to get a purchase on this work? It is as

thick with narrative stuff as any novel in recent memory, but it has axial

strands involving Enfield, a tennis academy outside Boston; Ennet House, a

residence for recovering substance abusers; and a fantastical conspiracy tale

featuring Qu&eacute;becois-separatist terrorists and, not insignificantly, a

Cambridge storefront owned by the brothers Antitoi.<p>



Get it? I'm not sure "get it" is the point here, really. I could lay out a full

half dozen other major plot elements and the big picture would still not begin

to come clear. You see, in this young writer's vision the big picture, if we

can even speak of such a thing, does not have a "clear" to come to: that is

part of what the whole, the sum of the parts, is saying about the world, about

reality. Wallace is scrabbling along the high-terrain paths earlier explored by

<A HREF="http://www.pomona.edu/pynchon/index.html">Thomas Pynchon</A> and 

<A HREF="http://arachnid.colgate.edu/maroon/ArchiveS95/Text2.3.95/milley.html">William Gaddis</A>. Indeed, not only does he share with both a

mordantly black view of modern and late-modern experience, but he also has a

penchant for weaving long braids from enticingly antiphonal plots, each of

which is differently absorbing, if not for its characterizations or imaginative

brio then for the sharp snap of its thought, the obsessiveness of its

informational reference (hence the notes), or--and--the incandescence of the

writing.<p>



Wallace's particular conceit in <i>Infinite Jest</i> is that the events

described are taking place in the indeterminate future, possibly several

decades hence. Some features are familiar, while others have an ominous or

spoofy futuristic cast. Wallace is not afraid to commingle various tonal and

thematic registers. Against the more credible psychological travails of the

central characters he sets past-tense references to the Limbaugh presidency and

descriptions of the "Great Concavity," a large area of New England that has

been ceded to Canada and yet is used as a dumping ground (gigantic catapults

near Boston send canisters of trash and toxins arcing thither).<p>



<font size=5>B</font>UT these more outr&eacute; materials combine to form what is finally a

thematic second tier. The foreground of <i>Infinite Jest</i> features three

basic plot systems. At the center of one is Hal Incandenza, an adolescent

tennis star attending Enfield Tennis Academy (ETA), which his family founded,

and which has been administered by his mother and uncle since his father,

James, who was also an experimental filmmaker, ended things by putting his head

in a specially rigged microwave oven. Hal, who is compulsive and brilliant,

shows his damage obliquely: he cannot walk the orthogonal paths of ETA with an

unaltered mind. "Hal likes to get high in secret," we read, "but a bigger

secret is that he's as attached to the secrecy as he is to getting high." An

intriguing filtering presence, and a fine departure point for Wallace's various

divagations into Incandenza family lore, Hal does not himself do much besides

play tennis and, late in the book, try to stop smoking pot.<p>



Then there is the world of Don Gately. Gately is a former drug abuser and

breaking-and-entering artist who made the bad mistake of going after an

assistant D.A. who once caused him to do some time. After invading the man's

home, Gately sent him 

<blockquote>two high-pixel Polaroid snapshots, one of big Don Gately and one of his

associate, each in a Halloween mask denoting a clown's great good professional

cheer, each with his pants down and bent over and each with the enhanced-focus

handle of one of the couple's toothbrushes protruding from his bottom. 

</blockquote>

The photos came, of course, after husband and wife had had ample time to carry

out their hygienic rituals; the A.D.A.'s wife became, alas, unhinged. Now,

hiding out at Ennet House, trying to go straight (indeed, finding in himself a

reservoir of saintly impulses), Gately lives in daily dread of being found by

the vengeful A.D.A. He performs his menial tasks, goes to meetings, interacts

with the other Ennet denizens. Again, little happens in the way of conventional

plot.<p>



<i>Infinite Jest</i> comes, in time, to seem like some great clattering vehicle

that is powered by a rudimentary three-stroke engine, the narrative passing in

steady sequence from Enfield to Ennet to a plateau lookout in the Southwest

where two Qu&eacute;becois-separatist agents are having a secret rendezvous,

trying to determine how their people might get hold of a particular

"cartridge," or film cassette. The film, the eponymous <i>Infinite Jest</i>,

was made by James Incandenza and has the terrifying capacity to send anyone who

views it into a crazed state of fixation that quickly leads to death. Why or

how this should be is never made clear, nor do we expect it to be.<p>



Each of the narrative sections has its own compelling dynamic, often against

the odds. Why read countless pages detailing the Byzantine logistics of daily

tennis drills? Because, for one thing, Wallace's writing is edgy, accurate, and

darkly witty. 

<blockquote>Here is how to don red and gray E.T.A. sweats and squad-jog a weekly 40 km. up

and down urban Commonwealth Avenue even though you would rather set your hair

on fire than jog in a pack. Jogging is painful and pointless, but you are not

in charge. Your brother gets to ride shotgun while a senile German blows BBs at

your legs both of them laughing and screaming <i>Schnell</i>.</blockquote>

Though nothing much happens at Enfield, our prolonged exposure to the academy

system reveals the terrible repressions that keep everything in its place. This

is a game world, a closed system, but the idea of play has been pumped out of

it, and the remaining husk is but a slight barrier against the maniacal forces

at large in the world. These are conjured for us through countless vignettes:

of the awful unraveling of Hal's father; of the brittle poise and warped lusts

of his mother, Avril; of the desperado backgrounds of the Ennet residents, not

least the self-immolating habits of the younger Don Gately.<p>



Gately, like his housemates, is at once sick and arrestingly vulnerable--and

more human than the competitive automatons being groomed at nearby ETA. When

tenderness and conscience announce themselves in the soul of a thug, we cannot

but be moved. So, too, we have to smile at the fumbling steps he takes on his

way to true self-reconstruction.

<blockquote>He had nothing in the way of a like God-concept, and at that point maybe even

less than nothing in terms of interest in the whole thing; he treated prayer

like setting an oven-temp according to a box's direction. Thinking of it as

talking to the ceiling was somehow preferable to imagining talking to Nothing.

And he found it embarrassing to get down on his knees in his underwear, and

like the other guys in the room he always pretended his sneakers were like way

under the bed and he had to stay down there a while to find them and get them

out, when he prayed, but he did it . . . .

</blockquote>



<font size=5>S</font>TROKE, stroke, stroke--over a distance of hundreds of pages. Readers either

drop out (some will) or push on, lured by the interest of the idiosyncratic

prose itself, but also by curiosity and some fundamental incredulity. The

denizens of these worlds are so far removed from one another--tennis brats,

recovering druggies, Qu&eacute;becois separatists--that the author will

<i>have</i> to turn magician. Surely the hankies he has tucked into various

pockets will cascade forth in a riotous splurge of color. But no. Even though

signs of linkage start to proliferate, and even though a fascinating bridge

between worlds is created through the trajectory of one Joelle van Dyne (a

former girlfriend of Hal's older brother, and perhaps of his father, too; the

star of the film <i>Infinite Jest</i>; a suicidal cokehead who comes to Ennet

and takes a shine to Gately), the plot lines do not come to apocalyptic or even

transfiguring intersection. Whatever aesthetics we espouse, we are all closet

traditionalists in our expectations--and these must be shelved. Wallace rebuts

the prime-time formula. Think Beckett, think Pynchon, think Gaddis. Think.

Wallace has, in interviews, scourged himself, admitting to "devoting a lot of

energy to creating expectations and then taking pleasure in disappointing them"

(as noted). But the artistic intent in <i>Infinite Jest</i> overrides such

considerations, or at least places them in perspective. Wallace is, clearly,

bent on taking the next step in fiction. He is carrying on the Pynchonian

celebration of the renegade spirit in a world gone as flat as a circuit board;

he is tailoring that richly comic idiom for its new-millennial uses. To say

that the novel does not obey traditional norms is to miss the point. Wallace's

narrative structure should be seen instead as a response to an altered cultural

sensibility. The book mimes, in its movements as well as in its dense loads of

referential data, the distributed systems that are the new paradigm in

communications. The book is not <i>about</i> electronic culture, but it has

internalized some of the decentering energies that computer technologies have

released into our midst. The plot is webbed, branched, rife with linkages. This

could be a liability. If Hal were effectively the protagonist (as we first

imagine he will be), he would not generate binding energy sufficient to

counteract the diffusion. But the emergent figure of Gately--wounded,

desperate, but able to find and give love--allows <i>Infinite Jest</i> to work

as a postmodern saga of damnation and salvation. The novel is confusing, yes,

and maddening in myriad ways. It is also resourceful, hilarious, intelligent,

and unique. Those who stay with it will find the whole world lit up as though

by black light.

Indeed,so concerned are we that there now are voices in the land calling for"compulsory sterilization" and "compulsory birth control," for the withholdingof public support for illegitimate children in excess of a certain number, forconditioning welfare monies or parole or whatever on coerced sterilization, andso on. Yet little is done to make sterilization easily available on a voluntarybasis, particularly to the poor and underprivileged. Despite the lack of legalstrictures against it, it is often withheld by doctors and hospitals from thosewho need it and want it most. At the same time, there begins to appear on thepart of some an alarming readiness to subordinate rights of freedom of choicein the area of human reproduction to governmental coercion.<p><p><p>Notwithstanding all this, we continue to maintain strict antiabortion laws onthe books of at least four fifths of our states, denying freedom of choice towomen and physicians and compelling the "unwilling to bear the unwanted." Yet,as Doctor Christopher Tietze and Sarah Lewit point out in the ScientificAmerican for January, 1969: "Abortion is still the most widespread...method offertility control in the modern world." According to experts who participatedin a United Nations Conference on World Population in Belgrade in 1965,abortion is indeed the chief method of birth control in the world today, andthey estimated that about 30 million pregnancies are purposely terminated byabortion each year. Of these, studies indicate that almost one million are inthe United States. Since, however, abortions are still so difficult to obtain,we force the birth of millions more unwanted children every year. If we reallywant to cut our population growth rate on a voluntary basis, we should makeabortion available on a voluntary basis, at least in the early stages ofpregnancy. When Japan liberalized its abortion laws some years back, it halvedits rate of population growth in a decade.<p><p><p><p><br><p><br><b>Population dilemma</b><p><p><p>I do not recommend abortion as a birth-control method of choice. I merely statethat it is in fact the most important single method of birth control in theworld today, and to cut down on population growth we should make abortion easyand safe while we continue to develop other and more satisfactory methods offamily limitation. In addition to the 5 million women in the United Stateswithout access to birth control for whom abortion would seem a matter of rightwhen they want it, there are the uncounted thousands who after conceptionsuffer some disease (like German measles) or discover some defect which makesthe birth of a live and healthy baby unlikely, and the many, too, whosecontraceptive methods occasionally don't work. As the New York chapter of theNational Organization for Women notes in a pamphlet:<p><p><p>"There is no perfect contraceptive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administrationreports that the intrauterine devices, one of the most effective contraceptivesavailable today, have a failure rate of 1.5 to 3%. This means that if allmarried women in the United States could and did use these contraceptives,there would still be about 350,000 to 700,000 unwanted pregnancies a year amongmarried women alone. Even sterilization is not a 100% effective method ofcontraception; some operations fail. Therefore, in order to insure a completeand thorough birth control program, abortion must be made available as a legalright to all women who request it."<p><p><p>Starting in the mid-1960s, some erosion of the anti-abortion laws began to takeplace. But these efforts have not been supported by many of the more vocalgroups who are trying to do something about excess population growth; to them,compulsory birth control and compulsory sterilization are apparently morepalatable than voluntary abortion.<p><p><p>The result is legal chaos--which has been the situation with reference toabortion since it was first made illegal in this country. Contrary to popularbelief, the legal strictures against abortion are of comparatively recentorigin. Until the early nineteenth century--at common law both in England andin the United States--abortion before quickening was not illegal at all. Itbecame so only in the early 1800s. And according to Professor Cyril Means andothers who have studied the problem, the reason for the enactment of the lawswas not protection of morals or of the "soul" of the fetus, but rather areflection of the fact that at the time all surgical procedures were highlyrisky because of the probability of infection (this was before Lister).Abortions were made illegal for this reason except where they were necessary tosave the life of the mother; that is, where the great risk of infection whichevery operation involved was outweighed by the risk of carrying that particularpregnancy to term. The situation is today reversed; abortion under modernhospital conditions is safer than childbirth.<p><p><p>Nor is there any evidence that abortion involves psychological health hazards.A poll of the American Psychiatric Association in the mid-1960s revealedoverwhelming support for more easily available abortions and a conviction thatadverse psychological sequelae from abortion are negligible both on an absolutestandard and as compared with such sequelae from childbirth and unwantedchildren.<p><p><p>Though the population experts have not yet aligned themselves on the side ofabortion-law reform, something is beginning to happen. Seven states--Arkansas,California, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--haveamended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protectthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,and to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced theomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been andare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without thesupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of populationcontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts andare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds.<p><p><p><p><br><p><br><b>Who gets help?</b><p><p><p>The relevant statistics have been widely circulated: for example, oftherapeutic--that is, in-hospital--abortions in New York City in the earlysixties, the majority of them for "psychiatric" reasons, 93 percent wereperformed on white patients, 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio ofin-hospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipalhospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated withabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percentPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white.<p><p><p>The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with theestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not muchmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the "kindlyneighbor," the "close friend," or the woman herself. Generally speaking, thelaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors andnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors areobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospitalabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundredsor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these arethe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of theIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically costsomething between $10 and $25.<p><p><p>But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. Ina few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion maybe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,although no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows whatthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in anumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either"imminent" or "certain." But how "imminent" or "certain"? Is it enough that thepregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Orwill result in the birth of defective offspring?<p><p><p>Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, sinceabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely andopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecutingauthorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these, the meaning of whichpeople must guess at, are open to constitutional attack on this ground, as theUnited States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other "vague"prohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:the rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of thelaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on thegrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do theirprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical sciencetoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in theConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurringopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally"totalitarian" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of "cruel and unusualpunishment"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with theunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort toconstitutional grounds, will "interpret" the laws out of existence eventually,as has happened to the federal birth-control laws.<p><p><p><p><br><p><br><b>Absolutely excluded</b><p><p><p>So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparentinability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to seethe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,which in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortionlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.)<p><p><p>By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except theRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.The American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came outfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority ofpeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored atleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the CatholicChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is"ensouled" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, PopePaul said, "We must once again declare that the direct interruption of thegenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procuredabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded aslicit means of regulating birth."<p><p><p>To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any Americanstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of themother--the Pope adds an "Appeal to Public Authorities." He says, "To Rulers,who are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do somuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of yourpeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary tothe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, theFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing solaudably--generously revive their efforts." I submit that insofar as this is anappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,because it is inconsistent with the laws of the land.<p><p><p>By issuing such an "Appeal to Public Authorities," the Pope has placed in avery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this orin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally orotherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes toabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the womanbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.This leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors andCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicingsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing theAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice ofsectarian medicine:<p><p><p>"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exaltthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness."<p><p><p>"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or asectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldomis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian orcultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practicefollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgatorto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience."<p><p><p>Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their ownreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral viewson other members of society." Perhaps it is because of their awareness of theimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics whoare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholiclegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, havecalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of allstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, thestate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that someabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed tofollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest ofus.<p><p><p>To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclicalare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendmentguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. Andfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any givensituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problempresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they atleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding thetreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses.<p><p><p>It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whosetime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who wantto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion orcompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies haverepeatedly said, "The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of childrenis a basic human right." Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptiveuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should beinfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,and that may well be the choice.<p></blockquote><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><p><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1969 by Harriet Pilpel.

The author ofthis article, whose credentials are trusted by the ATLANTIC, is a collegegraduate in her forty-sixth year, the mother of three children, living with herhusband and family in one of the many commuter communities in the East.</i></font><p><p><p><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" vspace=10><p><font size=5>N</font><font size=3>EARLY everywhere in the world families now have the right to limit the numberof children they will conceive, according to their ability to love and cherish,feed, house, clothe, and educate them. The need for similar adult freedom ofaction to terminate accidental and unwanted pregnancies, for personal andsocial reasons as well as therapeutic ones, is being discussed covertly andsometimes openly by church, lay, and medical groups.<p><p><p>What are the facts about abortion in the United States today? How widely is itresorted to and by whom? What percentage is legal (therapeutic) and whatillegal? Are its illegal practitioners sinister moneygrubbers without skill,knowledge, or proper instruments, or are they licensed physicians? Is theoperation as potentially dangerous as generations of women have been led tobelieve?<p><p><p>Reliable statistics are, naturally enough, hard to get in the United States,though they are readily available from such countries as Sweden, Denmark,Russia, and Japan, where abortion is, in varying cases, legal. Nobody whoplaces a bet with a bookmaker has any particular hesitation about admitting it,but few women, gossips or not, discuss their abortions at the bridge table.Lack of discussion probably has nothing to do with shame or reticence but issimply a loyal conspiracy of silence on the part of women to protectabortionists. Any woman of childbearing age who knows a reliable man in thisfield has a stake in keeping him in business. She may need him herself, or havea close friend who will.<p><p><p>I set out recently to find an abortionist in the large Eastern city where Ilive. My husband and I are in our mid-forties and have three children. When Idiscovered that I was pregnant for the fourth time, my husband and I consideredthe situation as honestly as we could. We both admitted that we lacked thephysical resources to face 2 A.M. feedings, diapers, and the seemingly endlesscycle of measles, mumps, and concussions of another child. Years of keeping awary eye on expenditures (a new suit for my husband every two years and one forme every five) had allowed us to set up a fund which we felt would enable thechildren to attend reasonably good colleges away from home if some financialassistance in the form of grants or scholarships could be obtained. Since myhusband's income has reached its zenith, it was plain that one of the fourwould have to forgo all or part of a chance at higher education. The part-timesecretarial work which I had been doing for some years to augment our incomewould have to stop since the revenue it produces would not cover baby-sittingfees. We have no rich uncles likely to make our children their beneficiaries.We have also had sufficient experience living to acknowledge that while theLord will sometimes provide, He may be busy looking after somebody else whenyou need Him most.<p><p><p>A brief foray for information in medical circles indicated that in the statewhere we live, legal grounds for abortion are limited to patients known to havecancer, ectopic (tubal or peritoneal) pregnancies, and in some rare instances,acute heart conditions or advanced psychoses.<p><p><p>I spent a brief moment of reflective gratitude for a clean bill of health onthese counts, and then pushed my glasses up on my nose to read a book calledPregnancy, Birth and Abortion, written by four members of the Institute for SexResearch, founded by the late renowned Dr. Kinsey. It turned out to be mostreassuring, though it probably wasn't intended to be. I discovered thatabortion is an operation that all med students learn, even if they don't getmuch chance to perfect techniques; that of the institute's sample, only aminute percentage of women had suffered either physical or psychicaftereffects; and that while the authors made no attempt to estimate the numberof abortions performed every year in the United States, it was plain that evenwithout the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, I had lots of company.<p><p><p>Calmed by authoritative word and two tranquilizers, I settled down to see whatcould be done. First step was a visit to my obstetrician. (The boys from theinstitute indicated that probably every doctor in the country had been asked atleast once to perform an abortion, and there was some evidence that out ofcompassion many had obliged.) Mine had run out of compassion by the time I sawhim at 6 P M or else was too worried about getting his snowbound car out of theparking lot to pay much attention to me. He verified by pelvic examination thepositive rabbit-test result which had previously very nearly guaranteed that Iwas pregnant, and refused to interfere with nature. When I asked him whether hewould perform an abortion on me, he said, "No, thanks," in an absent way, as ifI had offered him a cigarette he didn't want, and I left.<p><p><p><p><p>With the only legal avenue I knew closed, I began my search for illegal ones. Istarted out by going through my personal address and telephone book andselecting from it five close friends who had the following in common: all wereintelligent, well educated, sympathetic, and discreet. Otherwise, they were amixed lot. Some were married, some divorced or widowed; some were young, somemlddle-aged; two were Protestant, one was Jewish, one Catholic, and the fifth ascoffer. Of the five, one had, to my knowledge, herself had an abortion, butthat was too long ago to lead me to suppose her operator was still at the sameold stand.<p><p><p>I called each and stated bluntly that I needed an abortion and asked whethershe knew anybody reasonably reliable who might do the job. Two (in addition tothe one I have already mentioned) said that they themselves had obtainedabortions within the last two years. Each gave me without hesitation the name,address, and telephone number of her physician. The fourth friend did a littledetective work and in twenty-four hours came up with another physician, chieflyremarkable for the fact that his office was directly across the street from oneof the city's police precinct stations. Fees, I was told, ranged from $300 to$750. My fifth contact got A for effort but was able to glean information onlyon a sort of disassembly-line procedure in a neighboring state, reputed to besupervised by a doctor. I discarded this as too shady for a middle-aged womanwith obligations to a family and sat down to call the physicians.<p><p><p>My first call was made to the doctor whose credentials seemed to me best. WhenI asked for an appointment at his early convenience, he replied--somewhatnervously, I thought--that he was considering taking a trip and asked that Icall back next week. Number two on my list proved able to see me the followingday. My visit did a good deal to quell the panic which had been buildingsteadily in spite of my efforts at self-control. The office seemed orderly, thetools of the trade were neatly arrayed in the glass cases dear to the hearts ofthe medical fraternity; the doctor's examination was brief and businesslike,and as far as I could tell identical with those performed on me over the yearsby obstetricians and gynecologists under different circumstances. He explainedin simple and understandable terms exactly how he would perform the operation,how long it would take, that it would be painful, but not intolerably so, for afew minutes. (I gather that except for abortions done in hospitals, anestheticsare almost never used. For obvious reasons, these physicians work withoutassistance of any kind. They are thus not equipped to deal with the possibleill effects of anesthesia; nor can they keep patients in their offices for anygreat length of time without arousing suspicion about their practices.) Thedoctor I was consulting described precisely the minimal aftereffects I mightexpect. We fixed a date at mutual convenience a couple of days off for theoperation.<p><p><p>This particular M.D. was able to strike a nice balance between willingness tohelp and lack of overeagerness to collect his $500, payable in advance. Hestated frankly that he felt the element of physical risk was negligible butthat the myths and exaggerations about abortion and the hard fact that it wasan illegal procedure created prior apprehensions of sometimes damagingproportions. He urged me to call him and cancel the appointment if my husbandand I felt there was any reason to reconsider our decision. Short of physicaland fiscal miracles we had no right to expect, I didn't see what could alterour circumstances and told him so, but I agreed wholeheartedly about theapprehensions.<p><p><p><p><p>The operation was successfully concluded as scheduled. Forty-five minutes afterI entered the doctor's office for the second time, I walked out, flagged apassing cab, and went home. Admirably relaxed for the first time in two weeks,I dozed over dinner, left the children to wash the dishes, and dove into bed tosleep for twelve hours. The operation and its aftereffects were exactly asdescribed by the physician. For some five minutes I suffered "discomfort"closely approximating the contractions of advanced labor. Within ten minutesthis pain subsided, and returned in the next four or five days only as the sortof mild twinge which sometimes accompanies a normal menstrual period. Bleedingwas minimal.<p><p><p>Post hoc, my conclusions are these:<p><p><p>     1. If five people, of my limited acquaintance, knew five differentabortionists in active practice within a few square miles of each other, I findmyself wondering if the abortion rate must not parallel the live birth rate inthe United States.<p><p><p>     2. Four of the five abortionists recommended to me were duly licensedphysicians. Is this extraordinary, or are the dark tales about all abortionsbeing performed in filthy surroundings by unskilled practitioners usingknitting needles exaggerated?<p><p><p>     3. My operation at least was performed with what seemed to me incredibleproficiency, speed, and deftness, with sterile instruments designed for thepurpose for which they were used. The Kinsey Institute is welcome to add me toits conclusions, which are that though they have been able to interview fewabortionists, they are much impressed with the skill, humanity, andunderstanding these few showed for their patients.<p><p><p>I am sure that my experience is not unique. There must be hundreds like me fromcoast to coast who for sober and considered reasons daily undergo the samefears, search for the same kinds of operative sources, and find the moneynecessary to terminate unwanted pregnancy.<p><p><p>Some states are less rigid in enforcing antiabortion statutes than others. Thelow nationwide rate of convictions obtained against abortionists perhaps pointsnot only to the difficulty of obtaining evidence against them but also to theacknowledgment by law enforcement agencies of the real necessity of suchpractices. As the Kinsey group says, "In our own sample we find that the greatpercentage of the women who had an illegal abortion stated that it had been thebest solution to their immediate problem. This widespread difference betweenour overt culture as expressed in our laws and public pronouncements and ourcovert culture as expressed in what people actually do and secretly think is astrue with abortion as with most types of sexual behavior."<p><p><p>Is the time coming when we can rid ourselves of one more hypocrisy, closing thegap between what we do and what we say we do? Therapeutic abortion practiceswill have to lead the way. There is some evidence that the first steps havebeen taken. Grounds for therapeutic abortion vary widely from state to stateand from city to city. Unfavorable Rh factors, for instance, are consideredreason to terminate pregnancy by some physicians in some areas, as is a case ofGerman measles suffered in the early stages of pregnancy. Social grounds forabortion could follow, under the surveillance of abortion boards composed ofM.D.'s and psychiatrists. (Such boards exist in many areas but are generallyrubber-stamp groups who are notified by a physician that he will be performinga therapeutic abortion on date fixed by him in the hospital of his choice.)<p><p><p>I believe that dilation and curettage is the only method of abortion used,legally or illegally by most physicians in this country. Though the operationis a relatively simple one, it remains an operative procedure with someattendant risk of infection, however small, whether performed withoutanesthesia, in a hospital or in a doctor's office. Again citing the Kinseygroup: "It is already evident that it would not be difficult to developeffective and safe abortifacients, including some to be taken orally. The factthat such a development has not been made is largely a moral matter."<p><p><p>The italics are mine. Is it moral anguish, fear of fine or imprisonment, andterror about illicit practices on families who have sound social reasons forterminating an unwanted pregnancy? If it is moral to prevent conception, is itimmoral to interrupt an ill-advised one?<p></blockquote><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

		MAY be old, but I'm not dead.<p>
		
	Perhaps you are surprised to hear this. You may be surprised to learn that
people like me are still capable of original ideas, intelligent insights, and
intense feelings. Passionate love affairs, for example, are not uncommon here.
Pacemakers cannot regulate the wild, unbridled yearnings of the heart. You do
not wish to know this, I imagine. This knowledge is probably upsetting to you,
as it is upsetting to my sons, who do not want to hear, for instance, about my
relationship with Dr. Solomon Marx, the historian. "Please, Mom," my son Alex
said, rolling his eyes. "Come on, Mama," my son Johnny said. "Can't you
maintain a little dignity here?" <i>Dignity</i>, said Johnny, who runs a chain
of miniature-golf courses! "I have had enough dignity to last me for the rest
of my life, thank you," I told Johnny. <p>

	

I've always done exactly what I was supposed to do--now I intend to do what I
want.<p>

"Besides, Dr. Solomon Marx is the joy of my life," I told them. This remained
true even when my second surgery was less than successful, obliging me to take
to this chair. It remained true until Solomon's most recent stroke, five weeks
ago, which has paralyzed him below the waist and caused his thoughts to become
disordered, so that he cannot always remember things, or the words for things.
A survivor himself, Solomon is an expert on the Holocaust. He has numbers
tattooed on his arm. He used to travel the world, speaking about the Holocaust.
Now he can't remember what to call it.<p>

"Well, I think it's a blessing," said one of the nurses--that young Miss
Rogers. "The Holocaust was just awful."<p>

"It is not a blessing, you ignorant bitch," I told her. "It is the end; our
memories are all we've got." I put myself in reverse and sped off before she
could reply. I could feel her staring at me as I motored down the hall. I am
sure she wrote something in her ever-present
notebook. "Inappropriate" and "unmanageable" are among the words they use,
unpleasant and inaccurate adjectives all.<p>

The words Solomon can't recall are always nouns.<p>

"My dear," he said to me one day recently, when they had wheeled him out into
the Residence Center lobby, "what did you say your name was?" He knew it, of
course, deep in his heart's core, as well as he knew his own.<p>

"Alice Scully," I said.<p>

"Ah. Alice Scully," he said. "And what is it that we used to do together, Alice
Scully, which brought me such intense--oh, so big--" His eyes were like bright
little beads in his pinched face. "It was of the greatest, ah--"<p>

"Sex," I told him. "You loved it."<p>

He grinned at me. "Oh, yes," he said. "Sex. It was sex, indeed."<p>

"Mrs. Scully!" his nurse snapped.<p>

Now I have devised a little game to help Solomon remember nouns. It works like
this. Whenever they bring him out, I go over to him and clasp my hands together
as if I were hiding something in them. "If you can guess what I've got here," I
say, "I'll give you a kiss."<p>

He squints in concentration, fishing for nouns. If he gets one, I give him a
kiss.<p>

Some days are better than others.<p>

This is true for us all, of course. We can't be expected to remember everything
we know.<pre>

</pre>


<font size=5>I</font>N my life I was a teacher, and a good one. I taught English in the days
when it was English, not "language arts." I taught for forty years at the Sandy
Point School, in Sandy Point, Virginia, where I lived with my husband, Harold
Scully, and raised four sons, three of them Harold's. Harold owned and ran the
Trent Riverside Pharmacy until the day he dropped dead in his drugstore
counting out antibiotics for a Methodist preacher. His mouth and his eyes were
wide open, as if whatever he found on the other side surprised him mightily. <p>

			<img src="./castle.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="">


I was sorry to see this, since Harold was not a man who liked surprises.
I must say I gave him none. I was a good wife to Harold, though I was at first
dismayed to learn that this role entailed taking care of his parents from the
day of our marriage until their deaths. They both lived long lives, and his
mother went blind at the end. But we lived in their house, the largest house in
Sandy Point, right on the old tidal river, and their wealth enabled us to send
our own sons off to the finest schools and even, in Robert's case, to medical
school.<p>

Harold's parents never got over Harold's failure to get into medical school
himself. In fact, he barely made it through pharmacy school. As far as I know,
however, he was a good pharmacist, never poisoning anybody or mixing up
prescriptions. He loved to look at the orderly rows of bottles on his shelves.
He loved labeling. Often he dispensed medical advice to his customers: which
cough medicine worked best, what to put on a boil. People trusted him. Harold
got a great deal of pleasure from his job and from his standing in the
community.<p>

I taught school at first because I was trained to do it and because I wanted to.
I was never one to plan a menu or clip a recipe out of a magazine. I left all
that to Harold's mother and to the family housekeeper, Lucille.<p>

Anyway, I loved teaching. I loved to diagram sentences on the board, precisely
separating the subject from the predicate with a vertical line, the linking
verb from the predicate adjective with a slanted line, and so forth. The
children used to try to stump me by making up long sentences they thought I
couldn't diagram, sentences so complex that my final diagram on the board
looked like a blueprint for a cathedral, with flying buttresses everywhere, all
the lines connecting. <p>

I loved geography, as well--tracing roads, tracing rivers. I loved to trace the
route of the pony express, of the Underground Railroad, of De Soto's search for
gold. I told them the story of that bumbling fool Zebulon Pike, who set out in
1805 to find the source of the Mississippi River and ended up a year later at
the glorious peak they named for him, Pike's Peak, which my sister, Rose, and I
visited in 1926 on our cross-country
odyssey with my brother John and his wife. In the photograph taken at Pike's
Peak, I am seated astride a donkey, wearing a polka-dot
dress and a floppy hat, while the western sky goes on and on endlessly behind
me.<p>

I taught my students these things: the first flight in a power-driven
airplane was made by Wilbur and Orville Wright at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina,
on December 17, 1903; Wisconsin is the "Badger State"; the Dutch bought
Manhattan Island from the Indians for twenty-four
dollars in 1626; you can't sink in the Great Salt Lake. Now these facts
ricochet in my head like pinballs, and I do not intend, thank you very much, to
enter the Health Center for "better care."<p>

I never tired of telling my students the story of the Mississippi River--how a
scarlet oak leaf falling into Lake Itasca, in Minnesota, travels first north
and then east through a wild, lonely landscape of lakes and rapids as if it
were heading for Lake Superior, over the Falls of St. Anthony, down through
Minneapolis and St. Paul, past bluffs and prairies and islands, to be joined by
the Missouri River just above St. Louis, and then by the Ohio, where the water
grows more than a mile wide--you can't see across it. My scarlet leaf meanders
with eccentric loops and horseshoe curves down, down, down the great continent,
through the delta, to New Orleans and beyond, past the great fertile mud plain
shaped like a giant goose's foot, and into the Gulf of Mexico.<p>

"And what happens to the leaf <i>then</i>, Mrs. Scully?" some student would
never fail to ask.<p>

"Ah," I would say, "then our little leaf becomes a part of the
universe"--leaving them to ponder <i>that</i>!<p>

I was known as a hard teacher but a fair one, and many of my students came back
in later years to tell me how much they had learned.<pre>

</pre>



<font size=5>H</font>ERE at Marshwood, a "total"retirement community, 	they want us to become
children again, forgoing intelligence. This is why I was so pleased when the
announcement went up on the bulletin board about a month ago:<p>
<center>
WRITING GROUP TO MEET<br>
WEDNESDAY, 3:00 P.M.<p>
</center>

Ah, I thought, that promising infinitive "to meet." For, like many former
English teachers, I had thought that someday I might like "to write."<p>


			<img src="./rider.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="">


At the appointed day and hour I motored over to the library (a euphemism, since
the room contains mostly well-worn
paperbacks by Jacqueline Susann and Louis L'Amour). I was dismayed to find
Martha Louise Clapton already in charge. The idea had been hers, I learned; I
should have known. She's the type who tries to run everything. Martha Louise
Clapton has never liked me, having had her eye on Solomon, to no avail, for
years before my arrival. She inclined her frizzy blue head ever so slightly to
acknowledge my entrance.<p>

"As I was just saying, Alice, several of us have discovered in mealtime
conversation that in fact we've been writing for years, in our journals and
letters and whatnot, and so I said to myself, 'Martha Louise, why not form a
writing group?' and <i>voil&agrave;</i>."<p>

"<i>Voil&agrave;</i>," I said, edging into the circle.<p>

So it began.<p>

<p>
<font size=5>B</font>ESIDES Martha Louise and myself, the writing group included Joy Richter,
a minister's widow with a preference for poetry; Miss Elena Grier, who taught
Shakespeare for years and years at a girls' preparatory school in Nashville,
Tennessee; Frances Mason, whose husband lay in a coma over at the Health Center
(another euphemism--you never leave the Health Center); Shirley Lassiter, who
had buried three husbands and still thought of herself as a belle; and Sam
Hofstetter, a retired lawyer, deaf as a post. We agreed to meet again in the
library one week later. Each of us should bring some writing to share with the
others.<p>

"What's that?" Sam Hofstetter said. We wrote the time and place down on a
little piece of paper and gave it to him. He folded the paper carefully,
placing it in his pocket. "Could you make copies of the writing, please?" he
asked. He inclined his silver head and tapped his ear significantly. We all
agreed. Of course we agreed--we outnumber the men four to one, poor old things.
In a place like this they get more attention than you would believe.<p>

Then Joy Richter said that she probably couldn't afford to make copies. She
said she was on a limited budget.<p>

I said I felt sure we could use the Xerox machine in the manager's office,
especially since we needed it for the writing group.<p>

"Oh, I don't know." Frances Mason started wringing her hands. "They might not
let us."<p>

"I'll take care of it," Martha Louise said majestically. "Thank you, Alice, for
your suggestion. Thank you, everyone, for joining the group."<pre>

</pre>
<font size=5>I</font> HAD wondered if I might suffer initially from writer's block, but nothing
of that sort occurred. In fact I was flooded by memories--overwhelmed,
engulfed, as I sat in my chair by the picture window, writing on my lap board.
I was not even aware of the world outside, my head was so full of the people
and places of the past, rising up in my mind as they were then, in all the
fullness of life, and myself as I was then, that headstrong girl longing to
leave her home in east Virginia and walk in the world at large. <p>

I wrote and wrote. I wrote for three days. I wrote until I felt satisfied, and
then I stopped. I felt better than I had in years, full of new life and freedom
(a paradox, since I am more and more confined to this chair).<p>

During that week Solomon guessed "candy," "ring," and "Anacin." He was getting
better. I was not. I ignored certain symptoms in order to attend the Wednesday
meeting of the writing group.<p>

Martha Louise led off. Her blue eyes looked huge, like lakes, behind her
glasses. "They just don't make families like they used to," she began, and
continued with an account of growing up on a farm in Ohio, how her parents
struggled to make ends meet, how the children strung popcorn and cut out paper
ornaments to trim the tree when they had no money for Christmas, how they
pulled taffy and laid it out on a marble slab, and how each older child had a
little one to take care of. "We were poor but we were happy," Martha Louise
concluded. "It was an ideal childhood."<p>

"Oh, Martha Louise," Frances Mason said tremulously, "that was just
beautiful."<p>

Everyone agreed.<p>

Too many adjectives, I thought, but I held my tongue.<p>

Next Joy Richter read a poem about seeing God in everything: "the stuff of day"
was a phrase I rather liked. Joy Richter apparently saw God in a shiny red
apple, in a dewy rose, in her husband's kind blue eyes, in photographs of her
grandchildren. The poem was pretty good, but it would have been better if she
hadn't tried so hard to rhyme it.<p>

Miss Elena then presented a sonnet comparing life to a merry-go-round.
The final couplet went
<blockquote>Lost children, though you're old, remember well<br>

The joy and music of life's carousel.</blockquote>
<p>
This was not bad, and I said
so. Frances Mason read a reminiscence about her husband's return from the
Second World War, which featured the young Frances "hovering upon the future"
in a porch swing as she "listened for the tread of his beloved boot." The
military theme was continued by Sam Hofstetter, who read (loudly) an account of
Army life titled "Somewhere in France." Shirley Lassiter was the only one whose
story was not about herself. Instead it was fiction evidently modeled on a
romance novel, for it involved a voluptuous debutante who had to choose between
two men. Both of them were rich, and both of them loved her, but one had a
fatal disease, and for some reason this young woman didn't know which one.<p>

"Why not?" boomed the literal Sam.<p>

"It's a mystery, silly," Shirley Lassiter said. "That's the plot." Shirley
Lassiter had a way of resting her jeweled hands on her enormous bosom as if it
were a shelf. "I don't want to give the plot away," she said. Clearly, she did
not have a brain in her head.<p>

Then came my turn.<p>

I began to read the story of my childhood. I had grown up in the tiny coastal
town of Waterville, Maryland. I was the fourth child in a family of five, with
three older brothers and a baby sister. My father, who was in the oyster
business, killed himself when I was six and Rose was only three. He went out
into the Chesapeake Bay in an old rowboat, chopped a hole in the bottom of it
with an ax, and then shot himself in the head with a revolver. He meant to
finish the job. He did not sink as planned, however, because a fisherman
witnessed the act, and hauled his body to shore.<p>

This left Mama with five children to raise and no means of support. She was
forced to turn our home into a boardinghouse, keeping mostly teachers from
Goucher College and salesmen passing through, although two old widows, Mrs.
Flora Lewis and Mrs. Virginia Prince, stayed with us for years. Miss Flora, as
we called her, had to have a cup of warm milk every night at bedtime; I will
never forget it. It could be neither too hot nor too cold. I was the one who
took it up to her, stepping so carefully up the dark back stair. <p>

Nor will I forget young Miss Day from Richmond, a teacher, who played the piano
beautifully. She used to play "Clair de Lune" and "F&uuml;r Elise" on the old
upright in the parlor. I would already have been sent to bed, and so I'd lie
there trembling in the dark, seized by feelings I couldn't name, as the notes
floated up to me and Rose in our little room, in our white iron bed wrought
with roses and figures of nymphs. Miss Day was jilted some years later, we
heard, her virtue lost and her reputation ruined.<p>

Every Sunday, Mama presided over the big tureen at breakfast, when we'd have
boiled fish and crisp little johnnycakes. To this day I have never tasted
anything as good as those johnnycakes. Mama's face was flushed, and her hair
escaped its bun to curl in damp tendrils as she dished up the breakfast plates.
I thought she was beautiful. I'm sure she could have married again had she
chosen to do so, but her heart was full of bitterness at the way her life had
turned out, and she never forgave our father, or looked at another man.<p>

Daddy had been a charmer, by all accounts. He carried a silver-handled
cane and allowed me to play with his gold pocket watch when I was especially
good. He took me to harness races, where we cheered for a horse he owned, a big
roan named Joe Cord. On these excursions I wore a white dress and stockings and
patent-leather
shoes. And how Daddy could sing! He had a lovely baritone voice. I remember him
on bended knee singing "Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do" to Mama, who
pretended to be embarrassed but was not. I remember his bouncing Rose up and
down on his lap and singing, "This is the way the lady rides."<p>

After his death the boys went off to sea as soon as they could, and I was
obliged to work in the kitchen and take care of Rose. Kitchen work in a
boardinghouse is never finished. This is why I have never liked to cook since,
though I know how to do it, I can assure you.<p>

We had a summer kitchen outside, so that it wouldn't heat up the whole house
when we were cooking or canning. It had a kerosene stove. I remember one time
when we were putting up blackberry jam, and one of those jars simply blew up.
We had blackberry jam all over the place. Glass cut the Negro girl, Ocie, who
was helping out, and I was surprised to see that her blood was as red as
mine.<p>

As time went on, Mama grew sadder and withdrew from us, sometimes barely
speaking for days on end. My great joy was Rose, a lively child with golden
curls and skin so fair you could see the blue veins beneath it. I slept with
Rose every night and played with her every day. Since Mama was indisposed, we
could do whatever we wanted, and we had the run of the town, just like boys.
We'd go clamming in the bay with an inner tube floating out behind us, tied to
my waist by a rope. We'd feel the clams with our feet and rake them up,
flipping them into a net attached to the inner tube. Once, we went on a sailing
trip with a cousin of ours, Bud Ned Black, up the Chickahominy River for a load
of brick. But the wind failed and we got stuck there. We just <i>sat </i>on
that river, for what seemed like days and days. Rose fussed and fumed while
Cap'n Bud Ned drank whiskey and chewed tobacco and did not appear to mind the
situation, so long as his supplies held out. But Rose was impatient--always,
always so impatient.<p>

"Alice," she said dramatically, as we sat staring out at the shining water, the
green trees at its edge, the wheeling gulls, "I will <i>die </i>if we don't
move. I will die here," Rose said, though Bud Ned and I laughed at her.<p>

But Rose meant it. As she grew older, she had to go here, go there, do this, do
that, have this, have that--she hated being poor and living in the
boardinghouse, and could not wait to grow up and go away.<p>

We both developed a serious taste for distance when our brother John and his
wife took us motoring across the country. I was sixteen. I loved that trip,
from the first stage of planning our route on the map to finally viewing the
great mountains, which sprang straight up from the desert like apparitions. Of
course, we had never seen such mountains; they took my breath away. I remember
how Rose flung her arms out wide to the world as we stood in the cold wind on
Pike's Peak. I believe we could have gone on driving and driving forever. But
we had to return, and I had to resume my duties, letting go the girl John had
hired so that Mama would permit my absence. John was our sweetest brother, but
they are all dead now, all my brothers, and Rose, too.<p>

I have outlived everyone.<p>

Only yesterday Rose and I were little girls, playing a game we loved so well, a
game that strikes me now as terribly dangerous. This memory is more vivid than
any other in my life.<p>

It is late night, summertime. Rose and I have sneaked out of the boardinghouse,
down the tiny back stair past the gently sighing widows' rooms; past Mama's
room, door open, moonlight ghostly on the mosquito netting draped from the
canopy over her bed; past the snoring salesmen's rooms, stepping tiptoe across
the wide-plank
kitchen floor, wincing at each squeak; and out the kitchen door into moonlight
so bright that it leaves shadows. Darting from tree to tree, we cross the yard
and attain the sidewalk, moving rapidly past the big sleeping houses with their
shutters yawning open to the cool night air, down the sidewalk to the edge of
town where the sidewalk ends and the road goes on forever through miles and
miles of peanut fields and other towns and other fields, toward Baltimore.<p>

Rose and I lie down flat in the middle of the road, which still retains the
heat of the day, and let it warm us head to toe as we dream aloud of what the
future holds. At different times Rose planned to be an aviator, a doctor, and a
film actress living in California, with an orange tree in her yard. Even her
most domestic dreams were grand. "I'll have a big house and lots of servants
and a husband who loves me <i>so much</i>," Rose would say, "and a yellow
convertible touring car, and six children, and we will be rich and they will
never have to work, and I will put a silk scarf on my head and we will all go
out riding on Sunday."<p>

Even then I said I would be a teacher, because I was always good in school, but
I would be a missionary teacher, enlightening natives in some far-off
corner of the world. Even as I said it, though, I believe I knew it would not
come to pass, for I was bound to stay at home, as Rose was bound to go.<p>

But we'd lie there looking up at the sky, and dream our dreams, and wait for
the thrill of an oncoming vehicle, which we could hear coming a long time away,
and could feel throughout the length of our bodies as it neared us. We would
roll off the pavement and into the peanut field just as the car approached, our
hearts pounding. Sometimes we nearly dozed on that warm road--and once we were
almost killed by a potato truck.<p>

Gradually, as Mama retreated to her room, I took over the running of the
boardinghouse, and Mama's care as well. At eighteen Rose ran away with a fast-talking
furniture salesman who had been boarding with us. They settled finally in Ohio,
and had three children, and her life was not glamorous in the least, though
better than some, and we wrote to each other every week until her death, of
ovarian cancer, at thirty-nine.<p>

This was as far as I'd gotten.<p>

I quit reading aloud and looked around the room. Joy Richter was ashen, Miss
Elena Grier was mumbling to herself, and Shirley Lassiter was breathing heavily
and fluttering her fingers at her throat. Sam Hofstetter stared fixedly at me
with the oddest expression on his face, and Frances Mason wept openly, shaking
with sobs.<p>

"Alice! Now just look at what you've done!" Martha Louise said to me severely.
"Meeting adjourned!"<pre>

</pre>



<font size=5>I</font> HAD to miss the third meeting of the writing group, because Dr. Culbertson
sent me to the Health Center for treatment and further tests (euphemisms both).
Dr. Culbertson then went so far as to consult with my son Robert, also a
doctor, about what to do with me next. Dr. Culbertson believed that I ought to
move to the Health Center, for "better care." Of course I called Robert
immediately and gave him a piece of my mind.<p>

That was yesterday.<p>

I know they are discussing me by telephone--Robert, Alex, Johnny, and Carl.
Lines are buzzing up and down the East Coast.<p>

I came here when I had to, because I did not want any of their wives to get
stuck with me, as I had gotten stuck with Harold's mother and father. Now I
expect some common decency and respect. At times like this I wish for
daughters, who often, I feel, have more compassion and understanding than
sons.<p>

Even Carl, the child of my heart, says I had "better listen to the doctor."<p>

Instead I have been listening to this voice too long silent inside me, the
voice of myself, as I write page after page propped up in bed in the Health
Center.<p>

Today is Wednesday. I have skipped certain of my afternoon medications. At 2:15
I buzz for Sheila, my favorite, a tall young nurse's aide with the grace of a
gazelle. "Sheila," I say, "I need for you to help me dress, dear, and then roll
my chair over here, if you will. My own chair, I mean. I have to go to a
meeting."<p>

Sheila looks at my chart and then back at me, her eyes wide. "It doesn't say .
. ." she begins.<p>

"Dr. Culbertson said it would be perfectly all right," I assure her. I pull a
$20.00 bill from my purse, which I keep right beside me in bed, and hand it to
her. "I know it's a lot of trouble, but it's very important," I say. "I think
I'll just slip on the red sweater and the black wraparound skirt--that's so
easy to get on. They're both in the drawer, dear."<p>

"Okay, honey," Sheila says, and she gets me dressed and sets me in my chair. I
put on lipstick and have Sheila fluff up my hair in the back where it's gotten
so flat from lying in bed. Sheila hands me my purse and my notebook, and then
I'm off, waving to the girls at the nurses' station as I purr past them. They
wave back. I feel fine now. I take the elevator down to the first floor and
then motor through the lobby, speaking to acquaintances. I pass the gift shop,
the newspaper stand, and all the waiting rooms.<p>

It's chilly outside. I head up the walkway past the par-three golf course,
where I spy Parker Howard, ludicrous in those bright-green
pants they sell to old men, putting on the third hole. "Hi, Parker!" I cry.<p>

"Hello, Alice," he calls. "Nice to see you out!" He sinks the putt.<p>

I enter the Multipurpose Building and head for the library, where the writers'
group is already in progress. Driving over from the Health Center took longer
than I'd expected.<p>

Miss Elena is reading, but she stops and looks up when I come in, her mouth a
perfect O. Everybody looks at Martha Louise.<p>

"Why, Alice," Martha Louise says. She clears her throat. "We didn't expect that
you would be joining us today. We heard that you were in the Health Center."<p>

"I was," I say. "But I'm out now."<p>

"Evidently," Martha Louise says.<p>

I ride up to the circular table, set my brake, get out my notebook, and ask
Miss Elena for a copy of whatever she's reading. Wordless, she slides one over.
But she still does not resume. They're all looking at me.<p>

"What is it?" I ask.<p>

"Well, Alice, last week, when you were absent, we laid out some ground rules
for this writing group." Martha Louise gains composure as she goes along. "We
are all in agreement here, Alice, that if this is to be a pleasant and
meaningful club for all of us, we need to restrict our subject matter to what
everyone enjoys."<p>
"So?" I don't get it.<p>
"We've also adopted an official name for the group." Now Martha Louise is as
cheerful as a robin.<p>

"What is it?"<p>

"It's the Happy Memories Club," she announces, and they all nod.<p>

I am beginning to get it.<p>

"You mean to tell me--" I start.<p>

"I mean to tell you that if you wish to be a part of this group, Alice Scully,
you will have to calm yourself down, and keep your subject matter in check. We
don't come here to be upset," Martha Louise says serenely.<p>

They are all watching me closely now, Sam Hofstetter in particular. I think
they expect an outburst.<p>

But I won't give them the satisfaction.<p>

"Fine," I say. This is a lie. "That sounds just fine to me. Good idea!" I smile
at everybody.<p>

There is a perceptible relaxation then, an audible settling back into chairs,
as Miss Elena resumes her reading. It's a travelogue named "Shakespeare and His
Haunts," about a tour she made to England several years ago. But I find myself
unable to listen. I simply can't hear Elena, or Joy, who reads next, or even
Sam.<p>

"Well, is that it for today? Anybody else?" Martha Louise raps her knuckles
against the table.<p>

"I brought something," I say, "but I don't have copies."<p>

I look at Sam, who shrugs and smiles and says I should go ahead anyway.
Everybody else looks at Martha Louise.<p>

"Well, go on, then," she directs tartly, and I begin.<p>

After Rose's disappearance, my mother took to her bed and turned her face to
the wall, leaving me in charge of everything. Oh, how I worked! I worked like a
dog, long hours, a cruelly unnatural life for a spirited young woman. Yet I
persevered. People in the town, including our minister, complimented me; I was
discussed and admired. Our boardinghouse stayed full, and somehow I managed,
with Ocie's help, to get the meals on the table. I smiled and chattered at
mealtime. Yet inside I was starving, starving for love and life.<p>

Thus it was not surprising, I suppose, that I should fall for the first man who
showed any interest in me. He was a schoolteacher who had been educated at the
university, in Charlottesville, a thin, dreamy young man from one of the finest
families in Virginia. His grandfather had been the governor. He used to sit out
by the sound every evening after supper, reading, and one day I joined him
there. It was a lovely June evening; the sound was full of sailboats, and the
sky above us was as round and blue as a bowl.<p>

"I was reading a poem about a girl with beautiful yellow hair," he said, "and
then I look up and what do I see? A real girl with beautiful yellow hair."<p>

For some reason I started to cry, not even caring what my other boarders
thought as they sat up on the porch looking out over this landscape in which we
figured.<p>

"Come here," he said, and he took my hand and led me behind the old rose-covered
boathouse, where he pulled me to him and kissed me curiously, as if it were an
experiment.<p>

His name was Carl Redding Armistead III. He had the reedy look of a poet, but
all the assurance of the privileged class. I was older than he, but he was more
experienced. He was well educated, and had been to Europe several times.<p>

"You pretty thing," he said, and kissed me again. The scent of the roses was
everywhere.<p>

I went that night to his room, and before the summer was out, we had lain
together in nearly every room of the boardinghouse. We were crazy for each
other by then, and I didn't care what might happen, or who knew. On Saturday
evenings I'd leave a cold supper for the rest, and Carl and I would take the
skiff and row out to Sand Island, where the wild ponies were, and take off all
our clothes and make love. Sometimes my back would be red and bleeding from the
rough black sand and the broken shells on the beach.<p>

"Just a minute! Just a minute here!" Martha Louise is pounding on the table,
and Frances Mason is crying, as usual. Sam Hofstetter is staring at me in a
manner that indicates that he has heard every word I've said.<p>

"Well, I think that's terrific!" Shirley Lassiter giggles and bats her painted
blue eyelids at us all.<p>

Of course this romance did not last. Nothing that intense can be sustained,
though the loss of such intensity can scarcely be borne. Quite simply, Carl and
I foundered upon the prospect of the future. He had to go on to the world that
awaited him; I could not leave Mama. Our final parting was bitter--we were
spent, exhausted by the force of what had passed between us. He did not even
look back as he sped away in his little red sports car, nor did I cry.<p>

Nor did I ever tell him about the existence of Carl, my son, whom I bore
defiantly out of wedlock nine months later, telling no one who the father was.
Oh, those were hard, black days! I was ostracized by the very people who had
formerly praised me, and ogled by the men in my boardinghouse, who now
considered me a fallen woman. I wore myself to a frazzle taking care of Mama
and the baby at the same time.<p>

One night, I remember, I was so tired that I felt that I would actually die,
yet little Carl would not stop crying. Nothing would quiet him--not rocking,
not the breast, not walking the room. He had an oddly unpleasant cry, like a
cat mewing. I remember looking out my window at the quiet town where everyone
slept--everyone on this earth, I felt, except me. I held Carl out at arm's
length and looked hard at him in the streetlight, at his red, twisted little
face. I had an awful urge to throw him out the window--<p>

"That's enough!" several of them say at once. Martha Louise is standing.<p>

But it is Miss Elena who speaks. "I cannot believe," she says severely, "that
out of your entire life, Alice Scully, this is all you can find to write about.
What of your long marriage to Mr. Scully? Your seven grandchildren? Those of us
who have not been blessed with grandchildren would give--"<p>

Of course I loved Harold Scully. Of course I love my grandchildren. I love
Solomon, too. I love them all. Miss Elena is like my sons, too terrified to
admit to herself how many people we can love, how various we are. She does not
want to hear it any more than they do, any more than you do. You all want us to
<i>never change, never change</i>.<p>

I did not throw my baby out the window after all, and my mother finally died,
and I sold the boardinghouse then and was able, at last, to go to school.<p>

Out of the corner of my eye I see Dr. Culbertson appear at the library door,
accompanied by a man I do not know. Martha Louise says, "I simply cannot
believe that a former <i>English teacher</i>--"<p>

This strikes me as very funny. My mind is filled with enormous sentences as I
back up my chair and then start forward, out the other door and down the hall
and outside into the sweet spring day, where the sunshine falls on my face as
it did in those days on the beach, my whole body hot and aching and sticky with
sweat and salt and blood, the wild ponies paying us no mind as they ate the
tall grass that grew at the edge of the dunes. Sometimes the ponies came so
close that we could reach out and touch them. Their coats were shaggy and rough
and full of burrs, I remember. <p>

Oh, I remember everything as I cruise forward on the sidewalk that neatly
separates the rock garden from the golf course. I turn right at the corner,
instead of left toward the Health Center. "Fore!" Parker Howard shouts, waving
at me. <i>A former English teacher</i>, Martha Louise said. These sidewalks are
like diagrams, parallel lines and dividers: oh, I could diagram anything. The
semicolon, I used to say, is like a little scale; it must have items of equal
rank, I'd warn them. Do not use a semicolon between a clause and a phrase, or a
main clause and a subordinate clause. Do not write <i>I loved Carl Redding
Armistead; a rich man's son</i>. Do not write <i>If I had really loved Carl
Armistead; I would have left with him despite all obstacles</i>. Do not write
<i>I still feel his touch; which has thrilled me throughout my life</i>.<p>

I turn at the top of the hill and motor along the sidewalk toward the Residence
Center, hoping to see Solomon. The sun is in my eyes. Do not carelessly link
two sentences with a comma. Do not write <i>I want to see Solomon again, he has
meant so much to me</i>. To correct this problem, subordinate one of the parts.
<i>I want to see Solomon, because he has meant so much to me</i>. Because he
has meant. So much. To me. Fragments. Fragments all. I push the button to open
the door into the Residence Center, and sure enough, they've brought him out.
They've dressed him in his Madras plaid shirt and wheeled him in front of the
television, which he hates. I cruise right over.<p>

"Solomon," I say, but at first he doesn't respond when he looks at me. I come
even closer. "Solomon!" I say sharply, bumping his wheelchair. He notices me
then, and a little light comes into his eyes.<p>

I cup my hands. "Solomon," I say, "I'll give you a kiss if you can guess what
I've got in my hands."<p>

He looks at me for a while longer.<p>

"Now, Mrs. Scully," his nurse starts.<p>

"Come on," I say. "What have I got in here?"<p>

"An elephant," Solomon finally says.<p>

"Close enough!" I cry, and lean right over to kiss his sweet old cheek, being
unable to reach his mouth.<p>

"Mrs. Scully," his nurse starts again, but I'm gone, I'm history, I'm out the
front door and around the parking circle and up the long entrance drive to the
highway. It all connects. Everything connects. The sun is bright, the dogwoods
are blooming, the state flower of Virginia is the dogwood, I can still see the
sun on the Chickahominy River and my own little sons as they sail their own
little boats in a tidal pool by the Chesapeake Bay, they were all blond boys
once, though their hair would darken later, Annapolis is the capital of
Maryland, the first historic words ever transmitted by telegraph came to
Maryland: "What hath God wrought?" The sun is still shining. It glares off the
snow on Pike's Peak, it gleams through the milky blue glass of the old
apothecary jar in the window of Harold Scully's shop, it warms the asphalt on
that road where Rose and I lie waiting, waiting, waiting.

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>"I</font> WANT to build a great raincoat," Joseph Abboud says to his design team. The
setting is Abboud's twenty-seventh-floor office-studio on Fifth Avenue, and
none of the floating company of four or five young men and women--bright,
energetic, alive to the shades of Abboud's mood--who flit in and out of the
meeting seem to find the statement remarkable. It's what they expect from
Abboud, forty-four, an internationally known men's (and lately women's) fashion
designer. He uses an argot of ambition rarely seen in interviews with artists
or writers or filmmakers, who shrink from using the <i>G</i>-word about the
products of their hands or hearts or eyes. Earlier, in an interview in his
small, sample-strewn office, Abboud boasted proudly if mixaphorically, "We
changed the face of neckwear," speaking of the earth-toned, intricately
patterned ties whose designs he sketches insatiably--in doodles while he talks
on the phone, in notebooks on long flights, and on the dissolving surfaces of
his dreams. "Let's stay on the silk issue," Abboud says, as the raincoat
meeting threatens to stray into wool. At another juncture: "Let's save that for
the trouser discussion." In Joseph Abboud's world silk is an issue and trousers
achieve the dignity of discussion. <p>

		<A HREF="./abboudbg.htm"><img src="./abboudsm.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="(Joseph 
		Abboud at work)" border=0></A>


Coming soon to a select group of stores across the country--"Fifty or sixty
doors," Abboud says, in retail-speak--will be Abboud's "American Soft"
collection of men's wear, a new look that he predicts will define "the way men
will want to dress five or ten years down the road." Abboud is not alone on
that road. Italian designers like Zegna and Armani pioneered the soft look, and
the Americans Donna Karan and Calvin Klein are also going soft. This trend and
Abboud's track record in the market argue that he may be right about what men
will be wearing in the early 2000s. He has had his own label for nearly ten
years; before that he designed for Ralph Lauren; before that he sold and bought
clothes for Louis, Boston, the Tiffany of clothiers. The psychosexual
reverberations of the rubric are unfortunate, though, for men's wear. Will
future historians of this <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> seize on "American Soft"
as a text for our time? Abboud might have been wiser to run that one by the
boys on Madison Avenue.<p>

The clothes themselves, to quote from <i>DNR</i>, a men's fashion magazine, are
a wearer-friendly mixture of "crepey" and "drapey" wools and blends "devoid of
any drop-dead bold patterns." They have to a marked degree what one of Abboud's
fellow Bostonians, the art historian and collector Bernard Berenson, called
"tactile values"--they want to be held, felt, <i>touched</i>. They are meant to
be worn mixed and matched--suit coats as sport jackets, suit trousers as
slacks--in a way that is familiar to women but not to men. Traditionally men
have had two wardrobes, one for the workweek, the other for the weekend,
although most men, of course, don't regard the mistakes cluttering their
closets as anything so grand as a wardrobe. Like the great Italians, Abboud
designs for the narrow band of customers--one percent of all buyers--who are
willing to spend $500 or more for a suit, and who make up the new world market
in designer-label men's clothes. Abboud may be the sole graduate of Roslindale
High School in that one percent. <pre>
</pre>

<font size=5>B</font>ORN in Boston's polyglot South End to first-generation Lebanese-American
parents, Abboud had an all-Boston boyhood, pedaling a swan boat in the Public
Garden as his summer job and working for a clothier as firmly identified with
the city as the sacred cod. At Roslindale High, where he played football and
ran track, he was voted best-dressed in his senior class ("I always loved
clothes"). His first after-school job was as a salesman with Anderson-Little,
where today you can still buy a suit for $100--about the price of an Abboud
shirt. Brainy and hardworking, he won a scholarship to the newly established
University of Massachusetts at Boston, whose downtown campus was a short walk
from his South End home and was even closer to the smart clothing shops of the
Back Bay, where Abboud would window-shop and indulge the dream of his destiny.
<p> 
One day, on a vagrant impulse, and not answering an ad, he walked into Louis,
Boston, the city's poshest clothing store, and asked for a job. For a freshman
of limited means, a kid who worked to help support his family, this took guts.
To most locals, Louis, Boston was an intimidating place, a citadel of swank in
a city whose dress code owed more to Cotton Mather than to Yves Saint Laurent.
Yet Abboud's classmates at Roslindale High had not voted him best-dressed for
nothing. Slim, with rugged and vaguely Continental good looks, he wore clothes
well and was well-spoken and personable enough to seem a plausible salesman.
Courtesy of Louis's layaway plan, Abboud was now the best-dressed student at U
Mass-Boston.<p>

In truth, that was no strenuous distinction. This was, after all, the late
1960s, the era of tie-dyed shirts, patched jeans, fashion by Army surplus.
Attending the same university a few years earlier, I went to classes with my
employer's name, "W. T. Byrns Motor Express," stitched in white across the
pocket of my blue work shirt, and no one thought me odd--at least not on that
account. Abboud, who went directly to work from school, wore a coat and tie.
"Half the kids thought I was a professor," he says. In fact he sold clothes to
one of his professors. He had the salesman's gift for filling but not drowning
silences, and in working at Louis, a mecca for the discriminating and
well-heeled buyer, he had the perfect job for someone mad about clothes. On one
of his first Saturdays at Louis he sold a customer $2,600 worth of shirts and
ties. "And this was in 1969!" he exclaims.<p>

"I was very proud to be around beautiful things," he says of his days at Louis.
Explaining just why this tie went well with that sport coat, he was refining
the taste, honing the eye, creating the vocabulary of style, that would one day
win him unprecedented back-to-back (1990 and 1991) Designer of the Year awards
for men's wear from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.<p>

Encouraged by one of his professors (he majored in English and French
literature), Abboud applied for and won a fellowship to study at the Sorbonne.
He was to cross the Atlantic on the SS <i>France</i>, which sailed from New
York; to get to the ship he had to take a plane. "I had never been on a plane
before," he remembers, the wonder of his rise still fresh to him. In Paris his
education in style gained dimension. Living in the Latin Quarter for a year and
a half, he feasted on a rich diet of sartorial possibility. A scarf worn just
so. The insouciant gesture of a cravat. The second skin of a tailored suit
nipped at the waist. And surely it was in haughty Paris that Abboud learned to
say things like "A red tie is contrary to the dignity of the tie and of male
dress in general."<pre>
</pre>

<font size=5>R</font>ETURNED from France, graduated from U Mass-Boston, Abboud faced three choices:
he could pursue a graduate degree in French literature at Yale, he could begin
a career as a high school teacher, or he could take a full-time job in
management at Louis, with a chance to visit the posher precincts of the world
looking for beautiful clothes. Not many of us get such choices, and Abboud,
attractively, knows it. He stayed at Louis for eight years, from 1972 to 1980,
becoming a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Louis's president, Murray Pearlstein. A
famed retailer with an eye for quality in people as well as clothes, Pearlstein
inherited his family's business from his father, who got it from his father,
who emigrated from Russia and opened a pawnshop that took suits as well as
other valuables in pawn. Abboud's parents had both died when he was twenty-one,
and Murray and Dorothy Pearlstein filled a hole in his heart. "I owe the world
to that family," he says. <p>

But eventually we all leave our families, and so with Abboud, who accepted a
job at Ralph Lauren's New York headquarters and soon was made an associate
director of design. At first Abboud could not quite get with the Lauren
aesthetic. "It all seemed a little too traditional--too preppy--to me," he
says. "I could take the distinction of designing one of the worst seasons he
ever had." Abboud laughs at the memory. "I was off-message for what Ralph
wanted to do," he says, adding, "I knew that I had to do something different.
After all those years in the business, I asked myself, 'Am I really any good?
Or am I only good because I'm with good people--a Murray Pearlstein, a Ralph
Lauren?'"<p>

"It came to the point where I had the opportunity to start my own company," he
says, indicating by that studiedly vague formulation that he will say no more
about how he managed to finance the launching of his own line. Cash may often
be the stuff of conversation ("I got the car with what Aunt Mary left me in her
will"); but money, the one remaining taboo in American discourse, is still too
awkward for words. <p>

Picture Abboud as anxious in the months leading up to his first season, in the
fall of 1986, obsessively asking himself, "Does anybody really need another
label?" The market answered--decisively. "I sold every important store in
America. Bergdorf, Saks, Neiman Marcus, Louis." Two years later he went into
partnership with GFT, a major Italian apparel conglomerate. Now he could scale
up his fledgling business to the measure of the world and design not only
clothes but "environments" and--sweet smell of success!--a fragrance. Fame and
fortune lay before him. He needed only the kind of break that Ralph Lauren got
with the 1974 Robert Redford movie <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, or that Giorgio
Armani got with the 1980 Richard Gere movie <i>American Gigolo</i>--a chance to
dress a star. Enter Bryant Gumbel, who started wearing Abboud clothes while
broadcasting the 1988 Olympic Games for CBS and still wears them on NBC's
<i>Today</i> show. "I couldn't ask for a better friend," Abboud says,
unsurprisingly, of Gumbel, the first and best-dressed man millions see five
days a week. <pre>
</pre>

<font size=5>G</font>UMBEL was one of several celebrity customers I saw at Abboud's fall show of
men's wear, held at the Sony Music Studio, an antiseptic hall on Fifty-fourth
Street in New York. Faux scruffy, streaky-blond models with noms de mode like
Troy, Nikitas, Atesh, Hansel, and (my favorite) Rib paraded down a runway to
thought-obliterating music wearing a hundred outfits made up of several times a
hundred parts. The twenty-minute show takes eight months to prepare. "It is
pandemonium backstage," Abboud says. "I straighten ties, see if their shoes are
laced--and I always have to remember to check their flies just before they walk
out." <p>

The results? A collection of clothes with great eye appeal--relaxed, undressy,
and wearer-friendly, in keeping with Abboud's vision of versatile clothing.
Grays, taupes, charcoals, chocolates, maples, tobaccos, camels, olives,
lichens, sages, ferns, mosses, mushrooms, black gabardines, and oatmeal
Donegals predominated; there were no reds. <p>

I especially coveted the "Eucalyptus Chevron Wool Velour Overcoat With
Removable Sheared Beaver Collar," as it is listed in the show catalogue, and
the "Barley Wool Velour Sportcoat"--the kind of garment you could wear only if
you had the nerve (not to mention the cash) to live out your least plausible
fantasies. To wear a barley-velour sport coat, after all, is to send social
signals most men would be hard-pressed to live up to. This is a problem for
men's designers. The words that came to mind when looking at the runway models
in not all but some of these clothes were "gigolo" and "playboy," not
"investment banker" and certainly not "family man." Yet Abboud manages to sell
more than 100,000 suits a year in a world market big enough for barley-velour
sport coats.<p>

Asked to sum up the evolved Joseph Abboud "look," the man who created it
obliges. "If you put Giorgio Armani over here and Ralph Lauren over there," he
says, indicating the range in men's clothes from the mod to the traditional,
"we are right in the middle. Think of it as a 'transatlantic look.'" <p>

How right that Abboud should find his niche spanning the ocean his parents
crossed long ago, drawn by hopes for their family and America that he and it
have vindicated.

<font size=5>E</font><font size=3>arly last spring, Hastings Keith tried to return some money to the federal

government. For fourteen years Keith was a Republican congressman from the

Massachusetts district that includes Cape Cod. After leaving the Congress in

1972, he worked for a few months in the Nixon Administration and then went into

business. Together with the five years and ten months he had spent in the

military before, during, and after World War II, Keith had put in twenty years

on the federal payroll; and so, in 1973, at the age of fifty-eight, he was

eligible for the early retirement benefits the government provides.<p>



<p>



<p>



His combined congressional/civil-service pension provided him initially with

$1,560 a month, or $18,720 a year. He also received retirement pay, $55l a

month, for service on active military duty and in the reserves, which he began

getting in 1975. And in 1980, when he turned sixty-five, Keith drew a third

government benefit, his monthly Social Security check.<p>



<p>



<p>



Like other federal benefits, Keith's were fully "indexed" against inflation,

which meant that they were increased once, and in some cases twice, a year, in

step with changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Because of these

increases, Keith, whose highest salary as a congressman had been $42,500, found

himself by 1982 taking in nearly $61,000 a year in federal pensions. His

congressional pension had more than doubled since 1973, to $3,419 a month. His

military pension had risen to $903 a month, and his Social Security payment was

$691 a month. Another round of cost-of-living adjustments made this summer

raised Keith's federal pensions yet again, to a total of more than $65,000.<p>



<p>



<p>



And that was not the end of federal benefits for the Keith household. Keith's

wife had retired from the federal government during a "reduction in force " or

RIF, when she was forty-six years old. Since she had put in twenty-five years

of federal service, she was, as a victim of a RIF, entitled to a pension, which

started at $550 a month in 1976. By this year, it had nearly doubled, to some

$1,000 a month. All told, then, the Keith family's federal pensions came to

more than $77,000 as of last summer--and all of it was fully indexed to future

increases in inflation.<p>



<p>



<p>



To Hastings Keith, this seemed excessive. He wrote a letter to the secretary of

the Treasury, Donald Regan, explaining why he wanted to turn over three checks,

totalling $3,107, each representing a portion of his monthly allotments that he

considered unwarranted.<p>



<p>



<p>



Keith's hope had been to present his checks in a public ceremony, where he

would register his complaint about the system that depleted the Treasury to

finance windfalls such as his. The government shared little of his enthusiasm

for the plan. Instead, he was granted an audience with an assistant secretary

of the Treasury, who listened politely to his case, but did nothing.<p>



<p>



<p>



His rebuff at the Treasury did not stop Hastings Keith, who has been telling

his story to congressional committees and devoting his extra money to the

effort to change the federal retirement system. But the government's lack of

interest in his cause helps explain some of the current agonies over the

federal budget and federal deficits.<p>



<p>



<p>



Although the generosity of congressional pensions makes the sums in this

example extreme, they illustrate a basic fact of modern government. Benefits

that are indiscriminately awarded, and then ceaselessly increased, add more to

the federal budget than do those more familiar evils "cost overrun" and

"welfare fraud." Yet politicians of every camp have found it perilous to

tackle, or even to acknowledge, this problem.<p>



<p>



<p>



Since early this year, both friends and foes of the Reagan Administration have

understood that the next four years might well produce the largest sustained

budget deficits in American history. When the administration released its

budget proposals for fiscal year 1983 last spring, it did what no other

administration had ever done: for the years ahead it predicted a smooth, robust

return to national prosperity yet it still foresaw budget deficits that would

hover in the vicinity of $100 billion a year.<p>



<p>



<p>



Last year's reductions in tax rates are part of the reason for the deficits, as

are the administration's plans for a sustained military buildup. But while

these two policies have been debated to death, neither the administration nor

its critics have yet wrestled with the largest single force behind the

deficits. Neither liberals nor conservatives have yet devised a confident

approach to that portion of federal spending known as "entitlements."<p>



<p>



<p>



Entitlements, sometimes called "payments to individuals," are technically

defined as benefits for which people qualify automatically, by virtue of their

age or income or occupation. Social Security is such an entitlement, by far the

largest. So are medical programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, civil-service

and military pensions, unemployment insurance and price-support payments for

farmers, and (with certain technical quibbles over definitions) subsidized

housing and food stamps.<p>



<p>



<p>



From a budgetary point of view, the significance of such programs is that, at

least in the short run their costs cannot be controlled. If the Congress

appropriates $2 billion to build a dam or a highway, it can be confident that

no more than $2 billion may legally be spent. But when it authorizes extended

unemployment benefits, or a different reimbursement formula under Medicare, it

can set no limit on the money that will ultimately flow from the Treasury,

since the government is legally obligated to provide benefits to anyone who can

prove that he is eligible.<p>



<p>



<p>



The Reagan Administration took office committed to a fundamental redefinition

of federal responsibilities, but it will almost certainly depart having made no

dent in entitlements. From less than one third of federal spending in 1970,

entitlements rose to represent nearly half (of a much larger total) in 1980.

Even if the Reagan Administration should continue to be granted its every wish

for more military spending, and even if Congress were to concur in all its

proposed cuts in the rest of the budget, entitlements would still make up

nearly half of the budget in 1983 and 1984.<p>



<p>



<p>



The two national parties have virtually raced each other to distance themselves

from this dangerous issue. Old-style liberals to "neo-liberals," the Democrats

have attacked almost every other part of the administration's economic plan,

without volunteering their ideas about this half of the budget. In its

top-to-bottom re-examination of government spending, the administration

exempted from Budget Director David Stockman's scrutiny not only the military

but also the largest and fastest-growing entitlements.<p>



<p>



<p>



The "entitlement problem" is often thought of as a "welfare problem." To a

trivial extent, it is: most federal programs for the needy, including the

classic welfare program, AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children), do

fall within the entitlement budget. But they make up a small part of the whole.

Only a sixth of all the money spent on entitlements is for programs that are

"means-tested," or aimed at the poor, and those programs are the

slowest-growing part of the entitlements budget. For example, AFDC at $7

billion, costs one third as much as civil-service pensions, and it shrinks

while the pensions grow. Rather than a "welfare problem," the growth of the

entitlements is actually a "retirement problem."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



October 1 marks the beginning of the government's fiscal year, and in fiscal

year 1983, just begun, the federal government will, according to the latest

congressional budget resolutions, spend some $770 billion for all its varied

activities. Of that total, $362 billion will go toward entitlements; of the

$362 billion, $264 billion will be for retirement programs. In other words, one

out of every three dollars the federal government spends this year will be

spent on pensions or on medical care for those over the age of sixty-five.<p>



<p>



<p>



Social Security, of course, heads the list of retirement programs; it will cost

about $170 billion in 1983. Medicare, the medical-care program for people over

the age of sixty-five, is second largest, at $49 billion. Together, these two

programs account for more than half of the entitlement budget and more than a

quarter of all federal spending. Two other major retirement items are

civil-service pensions, $21.2 billion in 1983, and military retirement pay,

$16.2 billion. By way of comparison, the largest means-tested program, Medicaid

(Medicare's counterpart for the needy) is expected to cost $18.5 billion in

1983, and food stamps will be about $12 billion.<p>



<p>



<p>



Retirement programs not only dominate the federal budget, they also represent

its largest area of growth. The basic reason for this growth is demographic:

over the past generation, more people have been surviving to retirement age,

and the birthrate has declined. In 1950, roughly one American out of every

forty-three drew benefits from the main Social Security account, known as Old

Age and Survivors Insurance. Now about one in seven receives payments

(including those who draw from the newer Disability Insurance account). In

1950, every 100 working Americans had to provide, through their Social Security

taxes, the support for six retired people. Now each worker's obligation is five

times as great (thirty-one retirees per 100 workers). That ratio should remain

steady for the next twenty-five years, while the children of the postwar baby

boom remain in the workforce. But early in the next century, the ratio should

shift again. Fifty years from now, each person in the office or on the assembly

line may be responsible not only for his own livelihood but also for half the

support of a retired countryman.<p>



<p>



<p>



The average single man who retired in 1960 received six and a half times as

much money in benefits as he ever paid in. (These comparisons are adjusted for

inflation, and for the interest that the taxpayer could have been earning on

his contributions.) The man who retired in 1970 got back more than three times

as much as he contributed, and the man who retired in 1980 should eventually

receive two and a quarter times as much money as he paid in. But by the time

one of today's teenagers retires, in the year 2030, he will have paid more into

the system than he will ever get back.<p>



<p>



<p>



Moreover, while life-spans were increasing, the retirement age was being

lowered. The average man who turned twenty in 1940 could expect to live six

months past his sixty-eighth birthday. Since the retirement age was then

sixty-five, he could expect to spend three and a half years receiving the

retirement benefits toward which he had contributed during his forty-five years

of work. In 1956, the Social Security retirement age for women was lowered to

sixty-two; it was lowered for men in 1961. (Retiring at sixty-two instead of

sixty-five means a maximum reduction of 20 percent in Social Security benefits,

but most of those eligible choose to take their benefits as soon as possible.<p>



<p>



<p>



The average man who turned twenty in 1977, could expect to live to the age of

seventy-five, or thirteen years past his retirement age. Consider how this

young man's expectations would differ from his older counterparts. The thirteen

years he would spend in retirement would be nearly one third as long as his

forty-two-year working career. Forty years ago, the average retirement was only

one twelfth as long as the average working career.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Demographic trends, powerful as they are, do not fully explain the growth of

the retirement programs; political maneuvering deserves much of the credit. The

explosion in retirement benefits derives in large part from a reform gone

awry.<p>



<p>



<p>



The reform in question was an attempt to take the "politics" out of federal

benefits. In 1962, Congress undertook a reform of civil-service pensions. Until

that time, Congress had to approve each pension increase, in rituals very much

like its regular votes to raise the ceiling on the national debt.

Good-government spokesmen argued that this sapped the Congress's energies and

debased its deliberations, by enticing congressmen to play politics with

pension adjustments. It would be far better, they said, to delegate adjustments

to the automatic workings of a formula.<p>



<p>



<p>



The reformers also recommended an improvement over the military's system of

raising pensions whenever active-duty pay went up. In those days when federal

salaries were considered to be "low," it was argued that the government might

need to increase its pay selectively to attract the right talent; there was no

logical reason to pass this on as a windfall to retirees. Pensions should rise

only in accordance with the cost of living.<p>



<p>



<p>



Starting in 1962, therefore, pensions for civil servants were to be adjusted

once a year, in proportion to the rise in the CPI. Indeed, starting in 1969,

the adjustment was one percent more than the CPI increase. This one percent

"kicker" was supposed to make up for the lag between the rise in prices and the

annual adjustment in the checks.<p>



<p>



<p>



The other major step came in 1972, when Congress voted to index Social Security

benefits to the CPI (but with no "kicker"). Until then, Social Security benefit

levels had also been adjusted by the Congress. Switching to the index plan was,

once again, supposed to shield the system from political demagoguery. The logic

seemed so compelling that by the end of the 1970s, 30 percent of all federal

spending was directly indexed to the CPI, and another 14 percent was indexed to

other measures.<p>



<p>



The architects of indexing failed to foresee what would happen next, and

understandably so: through most of the fifties and sixties, inflation had

averaged less than 2 percent a year. But at just the moment when so large a

share of federal spending was being tied to the CPI, the historic American

inflation of the 1970s began. As prices increased by 8, 10, 12 percent each

year, exactly in pace rose federal payments.<p>



<p>



<p>



No, not exactly in pace. In fact, the payments rose faster, because of

peculiarities in the design of the indexing formulas. The kicker for federal

pensions, for one thing, put federal retirees far ahead of the game, until it

was removed in 1976. Civil-service retirement pay cost $2.8 billion in 1970;

after ten years of sustained inflation, it reached $14.7 billion in 1980, an

increase of 525 percent. Perversely, indexing meant that it could be more

profitable to retire than to work. Eric Heimel wrote in the Journal of

Contemporary Studies that a four star general who retired in 1971 would have

seen his retirement pay increase, through indexing, to $64,000 in 1981, while a

four-star general still on active duty in 1981 would be earning $54,000.<p>



<p>



<p>



In principle, indexed increases did nothing more radical than enable federal

pensioners to keep even with inflation. But in practice, their effect was quite

different. During the inflation of the 1970s, few prices rose faster than those

of energy and housing; but the increases in those prices, dramatic enough in

reality, were exaggerated by the formulas used to calculate the Consumer Price

Index. The costs of home ownership, which made up one quarter of the "market

basket" of goods whose prices determined the CPI, were calculated in a way that

made the index extremely sensitive to changes in the mortgage rate. For

example, if the mortgage rate were to rise by one point in a month, from 10

percent to 11, that change would, all by itself, raise the CPI for that month

by almost one full point, which could be "annualized" into an inflation rate of

12 percent. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this and other

quirks in the CPI's treatment of housing costs exaggerated the real rise in

consumer prices by as much as 6.1 points between 1978 and 1980, with each of

those points triggering an extra $2 billion in federal spending each year. As

for the cost of energy, the CPI market basket assumed that families would keep

buying the same amounts of gas and oil and electricity, no matter how much

prices might rise or fall. The real market basket of American consumers has of

course changed markedly from that of 1972. The era of cheap fuel ended, and

consumers cut back, but the CPI ignores such adjustments totally.<p>



<p>



<p>



Beyond these technical defects in the index was a larger question of fairness,

for "full indexation" led to very different fates for different segments of the

American public. It created a class that had nothing to fear from the inflation

that was the scourge of the rest of the populace. Those who retired from

private companies were, if anything, more vulnerable to inflation than their

working counterparts, since more than 90 percent of private pension plans offer

no cost-of-living protection. (Hastings Keith's pension from the private firm

where he spent twenty years started out at $160 a month and dropped to $100

when he began receiving Social Security) But because of the technical oddities

of the CPI, those who received federal pensions and Social Security could come

out ahead when prices rose. For one class of beneficiaries, indexation all but

shattered the connection between the nation's productivity and their economic

welfare.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



There is one further engine of growth at work within the retirement accounts:

medical insurance. In financial terms, the medical programs are potentially the

most explosive of all; they also present the most intractable of the

entitlement dilemmas.<p>



<p>



<p>



Through the past decade, no major program run by the federal government has

grown more quickly than medical care for the aged. Between 1970 and 1980,

federal payments for medical entitlements, of which Medicare makes up three

quarters (Medicaid accounts for nearly all of the rest), rose by 133 percent in

real dollars (i.e., adjusted to remove the effects of inflation). Medicare now

costs less than one third as much as Social Security, but it is increasing at a

much faster rate. According to projections based on the 1981 Social Security

Trustees' report, Medicare could, by the year 2006, surpass Social Security to

become the largest single item in the federal budget.<p>



<p>



<p>



That Medicare should be outstripping Social Security suggests that it is

subject to pressures other than demographics, since the clientele of the two

programs is almost the same. The pressures driving Medicare costs ever higher

are built into the medical system.<p>



<p>



<p>



American doctors, researchers, and hospitals have proven far more brilliant in

combating the ravages of age than in figuring out how to do so at a

controllable cost. This imbalance presents choices that are inescapably cruel:

who shall be denied kidney dialysis if the cost of serving everyone is too

high? Who shall pay the cost if no one is to be denied? These are precisely the

sorts of choices that democratic governments find most awkward to make, and

medical-entitlement plans reflect that uneasiness. Under Medicare and Medicaid,

the choices finally do get made, but only in a backhanded fashion that does not

pretend to be rational and does not succeed in being economical.<p>



<p>



<p>



The choices fall to the doctors: if your physician authorizes a trip to the

hospital and elaborate tests, Medicare will pick up the costs of the next sixty

days (after you pay the first $260). In principle, the brake on expenditures is

the cumulative effect of half-a-million doctors' prudent decisions. In

practice, the limit is often set by local availability of hospital beds, of

specialists, and of machines.<p>



<p>



<p>



After years of bitter struggle, Congress enacted the Medicare program in 1966.

Organized medicine, led by the American Medical Association, represented the

principal opposition; as part of the political bargaining that ensured

congressional passage, Medicare took on features that guaranteed that doctors

and hospitals would not suffer financially under the plan. Doctors would be

reimbursed according to a schedule of permissible fees--but the schedule would

be based on rates set by the doctors themselves. Moreover, the doctors were

free to bill their patients for supplements on top of the charge to Medicare.

Hospitals, unlike doctors, agreed to accept Medicare's reimbursement as payment

in full for a patient's bill. But that reimbursement would be based on the

hospital's rendering of "reasonable costs" of care. Hospitalization insurance

was automatic under Medicare. To get the extra coverage for doctors' bills,

each person had to pay a premium, now $12.20 a month. Nearly everyone chooses

the additional coverage, and so is effectively shielded from rising medical

costs--which was, of course, one of the fundamental purposes of the plan.<p>



<p>



<p>



The result of these arrangements was another of the "cost-plus" schemes so

common in government contracting. No party to the transaction had both the

incentive and the ability to economize on care. A hospital-building boom left

new beds waiting to be filled. Filled they soon were, and the charges were

passed on to Medicare or to private insurers. These "third-party reimbursers"

watched their payments shoot through the roof--hospital charges have typically

risen by 15 to 20 percent each year.<p>



<p>



<p>



This general quandary for American medicine has created a particular challenge

for Medicare, because expensive new medical techniques are most often used to

treat older patients. Nearly a quarter of all Medicare payments are made in the

last year of a recipient's life. While Medicare has been a resounding success

in enabling retired Americans to meet their routine medical needs without

financial terror, its budget is tremendously skewed by the costly last efforts

to fend off death.<p>



<p>



<p>



Political arguments about medical care have simmered down in the past

half-dozen years, because of the near-universal assumption that the time has

not been right to create another expensive new entitlement, in the form of a

national health system. Yet the very difficulty of balancing our public

accounts may soon refocus political attention on the basic questions of who

gets what kind of medical care, and how we can pay for it.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



As it drew up its proposals for the 1983 budget, the administration decided not

to recommend any reductions in Social Security, and only minor adjustments in

Medicare and federal pension plans. In so doing, it started out by declaring

one third of the budget off-limits for spending cuts. Another quarter of the

budget belonged to the military, and its share was supposed to increase to one

third over the next few years. A further 15 percent of the 1983 budget was

committed to repaying interest on the national debt.<p>



<p>



<p>



Together, these three areas account for nearly three fourths of all federal

spending without even counting the other entitlements. If they could not be

cut, an administration pledged to frugality and embarrassed by mammoth deficits

had little choice but to slash everything else. The administration proposed

"zeroing out" most job-training programs cutting research-and-development

funds, and taking other difficult steps. There was one final possibility for

savings: the "other" entitlements, those aimed at the poor. This possibility

the administration seized.<p>



<p>



<p>



Between Jimmy Carter's budget for fiscal year 1981 and Ronald Reagan's

proposals for 1983, the major pension programs increased by 20 percent and

Medicare increased by 30 percent. But in that same period. AFDC was cut by 20

percent, the low-income energy-assistance program by 30 percent and a variety

of nutrition programs, including food stamps, by 15 percent.<p>



<p>



<p>



The unequal sharing of the sacrifice became one of the administration's central

political problems: it led even conservative pillars such as Senator Robert

Dole to complain about shoving the burden onto the poor. Even so, the cuts were

not enough to solve the budget problems. No matter how deeply it might probe

elsewhere, an administration that chose not to confront the biggest

entitlements (to say nothing of the military) was left with the prospect of

deficits so stupendous that they could double the national debt within five

years.<p>



<p>



<p>



In the middle sixties, it took the simultaneous pursuit of a war on poverty and

a war in Vietnam to throw the federal budget into chronic deficit. Now it might

require nothing more ambitious than meeting our routine obligations.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Can the entitlements explosion be contained? The ultimate answer demands a

reconsideration of basic political premises that we have found comforting since

the New Deal. Yet certain technical changes, primarily involving pensions for

public employees, provide a place to start.<p>



<p>



<p>



The single most important technical change is to begin dismantling preferential

federal pensions and bring new federal employees into the Social Security

system.<p>



<p>



<p>



Federal employees now enjoy the nation's most generous pension plan. Most

private pensions aim at replacing 20 to 25 percent of a worker's previous

earnings. Social Security, reduced living expenses, and, yes, savings are

supposed to make up the rest. A federal employee with thirty years service will

typically receive 56 percent of the average salary for his last three years on

the job, congressmen 80 percent. All of it is fully indexed, of course

(although the Congress did, this summer, limit, indexing for retirees under the

age of sixty-two, on the theory that most of them were holding other jobs).

Federal retirees receive more in pensions than retirees from all private

businesses combined.<p>



<p>



<p>



The pension plans of private businesses usually require the worker and his firm

to invest, in varying proportions, the resources that will pay dividends during

retirement. Federal pension plans don't come close to doing so. The largest

contributions come neither from the workers nor from the agencies that employ

them but from general federal funds. Patrick Owens reported in Newsday that in

1980, federal workers and their agencies contributed a total of $3.6 billion

toward their retirement funds. The Treasury contributed an extra $11.9 billion.

The unfunded liabilities of the federal retirement systems--the commitments

made to workers but backed by no investment or trust fund--now amount to some

$1 trillion, roughly as much as the entire national debt. According to Hastings

Keith, unfunded liabilities average $149,000 <i>per person</i> in the military,

$173,000 in the civil service, and $530,000 in the foreign service.<p>



<p>



<p>



The generosity of federal pensions is a legacy of the 1920s, when federal pay

was poor. For the past twenty years, the federal government has embraced the

principle of "comparability," offering salaries comparable to those in

business. Why should the principle not extend to pensions as well?<p>



<p>



<p>



"Integrating" federal employees into Social Security would ultimately mean more

generous benefits for low-paid federal employees, especially those who do not

work for the government long enough to earn pension rights, since they would be

able to count their years in government service toward their Social Security

benefits. At the other end of the scale, it would mean an end to the windfalls

now available to "double-dippers": government employees who, having qualified

for pensions while still in their late forties or fifties, take private jobs

and become eligible for Social Security as well. Robert Myers, a former chief

actuary for Social Security who now directs a presidential commission on Social

Security, which will recommend reforms for the system this winter, contends

that <i>three quarters</i> of all retired government workers are either receiving a

second pension or are working in a job that will qualify them to do so.<p>



<p>



<p>



A few groups of federal employees have already set an example that might be

widely emulated. The retirement plan for the Tennessee Valley Authority has

since the 1950s been integrated with Social Security. Like most private pension

plans, it does not count military service toward its pensions; it applies its

disability standards more strictly than does the civil-service retirement

system; and it discourages early retirement. Except for the provisions for

early retirement, it offers benefits comparable to those of other civil

servants; yet, unlike most other systems, it is actuarially sound. The Federal

Reserve pension plan and a few others operate on similar principles.<p>



<p>



<p>



The logic of comparability also suggests a change in military pensions. Career

soldiers can now retire on half pay after twenty years of service, or

three-quarters pay if they serve for thirty years. (Members of the military are

also eligible for Social Security.)<p>



<p>



The demands of military duty obviously differ from those of any other work. But

the twenty-year career costs a great deal while adding very little to our

national defense. Gradually converting the military to a thirty-year career

might mean increasing active-duty pay, especially for the sergeants and petty

officers who are now the services' scarcest resource. In the long run, this

would probably cost less than adding to the mountain of unfunded pension

liabilities; and by reducing many officers' sense that their military duty can

be only a "first career," it might well enhance the services' integrity.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet all such reforms take us only so far. No matter how we might crack down on

the retired colonels and GS-15s, it will not make much more difference in the

entitlements budget than cracking down on welfare mothers would. Our national

accounts will remain out of balance until we wrestle with the IOUs that

middle-class America has issued to itself, through Social Security and

Medicare. The two awesome challenges of the entitlements are to control medical

costs and to re-examine our notion of who "needs" public help.<p>



<p>



<p>



The budgets for Medicare and Medicaid, in their leaps to the sky, reflect the

same pressures that are driving Blue Cross premiums and personal medical bills

up and up. Tinkering with the government programs is the minor solution to this

problem: the major one is changing incentives in the medical system. In forcing

this issue to the Center of political attention, the entitlements mess may

indirectly do some good.<p>



<p>



<p>



One political camp, exemplified by Senator Edward Kennedy, contends that the

government can never contain medical costs unless it controls the medical

system. To that end, Kennedy has tirelessly pushed for a nationwide, largely

publicly financed, centrally planned approach to health care. The opposite

view, espoused by David Stockman in his days in the Congress, holds that rising

medical costs reflect imperfections in the medical market. The answer,

therefore, is to unleash market forces through more competition.<p>



<p>



<p>



Of the two views, Stockman's seems more in harmony with the politics of the

time. The Reagan Administration plans to unveil a new medical-reform scheme,

emphasizing "market forces," about the time of the President's State of the

Union address next January.<p>



<p>



<p>



The logic of the market means encouraging the pre-paid medical plans known as

health-maintenance organizations. It also means--though this may or may not be

a feature of the President's plan--removing some of the padding that now

protects the typical patient from his medical bills. Economists lament "third

party" payment schemes, whether run by Blue Cross or by the U.S. government,

because they blunt the instinct for frugality that is so powerful when one's

own money is at stake. When the patient can pass the bill to someone else, why

should he worry about unnecessary tests? Why should he wait two weeks for an

appointment at the doctor's office when he can use the hospital emergency room

as a clinic? He will ultimately pay the bill, of course, through higher taxes

or insurance premiums; but the market functions poorly when its messages are so

long delayed and so weak.<p>



<p>



<p>



One government economist, who chooses to remain unnamed, has taken reliance on

the market a radical step further. Medicare's biggest economic problem, the

economist argues, is the last-resort measures taken before an elderly patient's

death, which dwarf the costs of previous care. When patients and their families

decide how hard the doctors should fight, and with what machines, finances do

not color the deliberations, because Medicare covers nearly all hospital fees.

The economist argues that when such a patient dies, his estate should be tithed

to recover a share of his "Medicare profit"--the difference between the

premiums he has put into the system and the benefits paid on his behalf. This,

the argument continues, would repair the social contract between the

generations. It would also build into individual decisions the same realities

that the nation faces, as high-priced medical possibilities grow more rapidly

than resources.<p>



<p>



<p>



This may seem a ghoulish suggestion, as its author is aware, but when public

leaders dismiss out of hand the possibility of questioning the rules, even

though those rules lead straight to bankruptcy, are a few ghoulish thoughts so

much more dangerous than the conventional wisdom? Whether or not this specific

proposal is workable, the spirit behind it is constructive, because it

demonstrates a willingness to think of new ways out of a predicament.<p>



<p>



<p>



The main idea waiting to be spoken is that people have different claims on

public support. Yes, there are cases in which the state bestows its benefits

equally on all. The Children of rich and poor alike should be entitled to

schooling at public expense. But to extend that logic to pensions and subsidies

leads to commitments beyond our national means. The people who really <i>need</i> help

need more than they are now getting. If they are to have it, other people must

have less.<p>



<p>



<p>



In the case of medical care, there are certain obligations that the state

should assume on everyone's behalf. Any burn victim, to choose one example,

should be entitled to the best care that is available, regardless of the cost.

But there are other obligations that the nation cannot assume, simply because

there would never be enough money to pay for them. Medical technology now

offers answers to many of mankind's universal complaints. Corneal surgery can

eliminate much of the need for eyeglasses. Joints can be rebuilt, arteries

reamed, gums surgically lifted and the underlying bone scraped to remove

plaque. We all "need" such services, but if all these innumerable repairs to

all parts of all bodies were carried out, the cost would rival the gross

national product.<p>



<p>



<p>



How, then, can we decide where to draw the line? One way is to ask each patient

to share more of the cost, giving him a stake in the decision about costly

care. But if that is done without recognizing the differences in economic need,

it will deny some people a more basic level of medical care.<p>



<p>



<p>



A twenty-dollar physician's fee, or a $500 deductible for hospitalization,

would mean quite different things to a retired couple with pensions and

dividends of $30,000 and a widow surviving on $4,000 from Social Security. For

the one, it would mean some sacrifice; for the other, denial of care. Yet our

retirement plans, in their magnificent evenhandedness, treat the poor widow and

the well-off couple the same. When we provide for some, we must provide for

all. If we change the rules so as to balance the budget, we revoke the widow's

right to treatment. But if we do not, we lose control of our financial

future.<p>



<p>



<p>



The original genius of Social Security was precisely that it did treat everyone

the same. No one need feel humiliated by accepting its benefits, because it was

not welfare. Everyone was included in the plan. As a political ideal, this is

most attractive; but, in Social Security as in Medicare, it may simply have

become too costly to sustain.<p>



<p>



<p>



Consider two of the major proposals for bringing Social Security's commitments

into line with its resources. One is to raise the retirement age, in

recognition of medical improvements and demographic shifts. Raising the

retirement age to sixty-eight by the end of this century would keep the average

time in retirement one quarter as long as the average adult life-span--the same

balance that has prevailed for the past few years. Another proposal is to hold

down the automatic increases in Social Security and other benefits, perhaps by

gearing them to the Consumer Price Index or the average increase in wages,

whichever was less in a given year. If wages rose faster than prices, the

buying power of the pension would be fully protected. If the reverse, people of

all ages would share in the sacrifice of a less productive economy. (The CPI

will, in any case, soon be revised to eliminate the housing-cost bias.)<p>



<p>



<p>



But if changes like these were applied "fairly," with equal effect on all, the

results would be unfair. Some people need the payments; others do not.<p>



<p>



<p>



To speak of "the aged," or "Social Security recipients," as one homogeneous

group no longer makes sense. As recently as twenty years ago, it did. Those

above sixty-five were then an economically distinct group. Like black Americans

or single women heading households, they were on the whole poorer than other

people. The economic differences within the group were less important than the

gap between them and the American norm. To aim a program at all retired people

not only made political sense, in avoiding the taint of welfare; it also made

economic sense, for it transferred money to people in need.<p>



<p>



<p>



That has changed. Older Americans are now economically very much like their

children's generation, and their grandchildrens'. Michael Hurd and John B.

Shoven, of the National Bureau of Economic Research, have reported that the per

capita income of people over sixty-five is now higher than for the population

as a whole. In 1978, it was 121 percent of the national norm. Two thirds of all

people over sixty-five own at least one home.<p>



<p>



<p>



As the differences between the generations have diminished, the differences

among older people have grown more acute. On average, those above sixty-five

enjoy parity with those below; but the average conceals many retired people who

are desperately poor. About a fifth of all retired couples have incomes above

$24,000; but of the 5.8 million single women sixty-five or older, fully half

have incomes below $5,000. As the world works, the wealthiest couples generally

receive the highest Social Security benefits (because they earned more when

working) but depend on them least. For the couples making more than $24,000,

the comparatively large Social Security check represents about one sixth of

their income. For the poorest elderly women, their smaller check is more than

80 percent of their total support.<p>



<p>



<p>



Can it be fair to treat these people "equally," to hold the widow's $300 a

month and the couple's $900 a month to an "even" 5 percent increase? Only a

perverted sense of fairness is thereby honored; yet it is this kind of equity

that our evenhanded entitlement policy now serves.<p>



<p>



<p>



In practical terms, the solution might be to provide a full cost-of-living

adjustment for only a certain portion of Social Security benefits--say, the

first $500 a month. A more significant step might be to make Social Security

benefits subject to federal income tax. The automatic workings of the IRS are

administratively far simpler than any other means for concentrating scarce

resources on people in need. Social Security is already subject to a tax of

sorts--the "earnings test," which reduces benefits by $1 for each $2 a

recipient earns above $6,000 per year. (The limit is $4,400 for those under the

age of sixty-five.) But the test does not apply to people above the age of

seventy-two, and next year the age will fall to seventy. More important, it

applies only to <i>earnings</i>, from jobs, and not to investment income or other

pensions, which are the major source of income for the most affluent older

people.<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet to tax Social Security would be heresy: that attitude is nearly universal,

its emotional and political power a legacy of the era when we could

effortlessly afford to treat everyone "equally." As I have tried to suggest,

that era has ended, but adjusting our assumptions takes time. The only

political proposition more challenging than taxing Social Security would be

carrying the logic to its next step, and asking why there should be extra

exemptions on Form 1040 for everyone over the age of sixty-five. Since older

Americans are, on the whole, economically even with everyone else, why are the

exemptions necessary? And since they transfer money to the wealthiest members

of the group (those who pay taxes) and do little or nothing for the poorer 50

percent, how can they be defended?<p>



<p>



<p>



We are understandably reluctant to face seemingly mean-spirited questions such

as these. Yet our reluctance helps explain why the entitlements have grown so

large, and why we seem so powerless to control them. We are also hindered by a

widespread misunderstanding of where most people stand on the economic pyramid,

and who should therefore be entitled to help. A family whose income is in the

mid-$30,000s is part of the richest 20 percent of all Americans. A family in

the mid-$50,000s is in the upper 5 percent. Yet most such people would be

horrified to think that they were anything but "middle class," entitled to

public help in financing their homes or sending their children to school and to

the rewards of a lifetime of work in the form of monthly Social Security

checks. As individuals, they undoubtedly deserve help; but if all of us are

entitled, where will the money come from?<p>



<p>



<p>



The entitlements problem has forced such questions upon us. The cost of

ignoring them is not simply the obvious--the automatic growth of federal

spending--but also the subtle destruction of other public goals. This effect

transcends ideology. It matters little whether you want to improve education

for all children, or build more aircraft carriers, or lift the burden of

taxation from the shoulders of America's entrepreneurs--all causes are in

jeopardy as long as more and more of us are "entitled" to support from everyone

else.<p>

	<B>corporate anorexia</B> <i>noun </i>, a company's loss of effectiveness due to

excessive shrinkage through various cost-cutting measures: "'I don't know who

first coined the term "<i>corporate anorexia </i>," but it is a danger,' says

Jim Stanford, president of . . . a Calgary-based oil and gas giant that has

gone through numerous downsizings and restructurings" (<i>Wall Street

Journal </i>).<p>

	

	Background: <i>Corporate anorexia </i>joins numerous other diet-related

business idioms, such as <i>Slimfast budgeting </i>, <i>trimming the fat </i>,

<i>corporate bloat </i>, and <i>lean and mean </i>. Associated with it are the

terms <i>survivor syndrome </i>and <i>ghost worker </i>. Sufferers of

<i>survivor syndrome </i>are overworked staff members remaining after a layoff,

who simply become time-servers. <i>Ghost workers </i>are previously fired

employees with critical insights into usually technical operations, who are

rehired by their former companies as consultants to perform specialized tasks

and solve complex problems.<p><br>

	

	<B>dwell time</B> <i>noun</i>, the period spent by airline passengers in airports

during flight delays: "[A] growing national problem . . . [is] time to kill at

the airport. Congestion has lengthened <i>'dwell time' </i> about 5% a year in

the 1990s. That leaves the typical domestic traveler warming an airport seat

for 59 minutes because of flight delays, the usual connection problems and

regular layover time" (<i>Wall Street Journal </i>).<p>

	

	Background: <i>Dwell time </i>has generated another problem: <i>gate-lock </i>,

the tendency of many passengers to <i>homestead </i>in departure lounges during

flight delays, unwilling to leave the area for fear of missing their flight. To

alleviate the burden of <i>dwell time </i>and to reduce <i>gate-lock </i>, some

airports have installed putting greens, meditation rooms, and massage-therapy

facilities near departure areas. The sense of <i>dwell </i>in this compound can

be traced retrogressively through the word's etymology. The current meaning of

<i>dwell </i>, "to make one's home in a place," derives from the word's

13th-century meaning, "to linger." This in turn developed from meanings in Old

English: "to lead astray; to confuse" and "to hinder; to delay."<p><br>

	

	<B>restorative justice </B> <i>noun </i>, an alternative concept in corrections

according to which only violent career criminals would be imprisoned, while

nonviolent offenders would work in closely monitored community projects,

earning money with which to make financial restitution to their victims and

their victims' families, to repay court and corrections costs, and to support

their own families: "'With <i>restorative justice </i>, we hold offenders

accountable and make the victim the center of the criminal justice process'"

(Joseph Lehman, Maine's commissioner of corrections, in <i>The New York

Times </i>).<p>

	

	Background:  Proponents of <i>restorative justice </i>estimate that 25 percent

of the nation's criminal offenders could be repaying their debts to their

victims and society by working, under electronic supervision, in a variety of

settings--in emergency rooms, for example, or driving senior citizens to

meals--and also receiving job training. Proponents make up an unlikely

alliance, including wardens, academics, prison chaplains, lawmakers, and even

some victims. The emergence of the concept and the term ("'I've been talking

<i>restorative justice </i>in Maine for years,'" Lehman says) is an anomaly in

an era of harsher sentencing guidelines and a push toward building more

prisons. <p><br>

	

	<B>sitting volleyball </B> <i>noun </i>, volleyball played by people with serious leg

injuries or leg amputations, usually on an indoor court smaller than regulation

size and with a net lower than standard height: "[In] Sarajevo . . . the game .

. . is the sport of the future. It is <i>sitting volleyball </i>--played by men

with damaged legs" (<i>Washington Post </i>).<p>

	

	Background: Also called <i>legless volleyball </i>, the sport can be traced back

at least as far as the aftermath of the Vietnam War, when an American team

composed chiefly of Vietnam veterans came into existence. <i>Sitting volleyball 

</i>has grown in popularity since 1992, when the latest Balkan strife began.

Another term arising from this war is <i>turbo folk </i>, denoting a discordant

blend of disco and traditional Serbian melodies with brooding, fatalistic

lyrics expressive of Serbia's isolation and the emotional turbulence that

attends civil war. <i>Turbo-folk </i>nightclubs are typically peopled by

garishly dressed women and men toting guns. Serbia, one observer has written,

is "a nation on the verge of a nervous breakdown. . . . And <i>turbo-folk

 </i>culture, something between gangsterism and a bad imitation of Madonna's

Hollywood, is the most pronounced expression of this psychosis" (<i>Wall Street

Journal </i>).<p>

	<font size=5>A</font>S an editor of Basic Books in the 1970s and 1980s,

	 Martin Kessler, a

political economist by training, who died earlier this year, published the two

most influential public-policy books of that era: Lester Thurow's seminal

analysis of the stagflation economy, <i>The Zero-Sum Society </i>(1981), the

most resonantly titled book since <i>Catch-22</i>, and George Gilder's

<i>Wealth and Poverty</i> (1981), which became the bible of supply-side

economics. How fitting that one of Kessler's last books should be David

Gordon's <i>Fat and Mean</i>, which analyzes the overriding economic problem of

the 1990s--falling wages and living standards--with Thurowlike brilliance and

scholarship and Gilderlike vigor, originality, and optimism. Yes, optimism, for

notwithstanding all the bad news it purveys, <i>Fat and Mean</i> shows how the

American Dream can be recovered.<p>



	<A HREF="gordidx.htm"><img src="../../../images/shorsera.gif" align=left vspace=10 hspace=10 border=0 alt="(Related Articles)">

	

	</A> 

The Dorothy H. Hirshon Professor of Economics at Manhattan's New School for

Social Research, David Gordon (a valued contributor to <i>The Atlantic</i> who,

sadly, died in March, at the age of fifty-one) was conceived in economics. His

parents were both economists: Robert Aaron Gordon served as president of the

American Economic Association, and Margaret Gordon was an expert on trade and

migration. With Samuel Bowles, of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst,

and Thomas E. Weisskopf, of the University of Michigan, David Gordon was a

co-author of <i>Beyond the Waste Land: A Democratic Alternative to Economic

Decline </i>(1983) and <i>After the Waste Land: A Democratic Economics for the

Year 2000</i> (1990), and of a number of highly influential technical papers in

professional journals. On this reader, at any rate, <i>After the Waste Land</i>

made algebraic demands; its complexity got in the way of its prescient theme

(the wasteful reality of the vauntedly efficient private sector). <i>Fat and

Mean</i> is no less indebted to the newest and most sophisticated research in

economics, but it assumes its debts much more lightly. The book is a model not

just of social-science research but of economic thinking. Testing hypotheses

logically and empirically, setting arguments against counterarguments, Gordon

vindicated his discipline.<p>



"The American economy has been failing most of its people. Why?" Gordon's

answer is the crux of his book, but for those who still doubt the truth of his

assertion, <A HREF="graph.htm">one chart is worth a thousand words.</A> It shows what has happened to

real spendable hourly earnings for "production/nonsupervisory employees in the

private nonfarm sector"--average workers.<p>



"The bottom line is clear," Gordon wrote.

<blockquote>. . . over the past twenty years, real hourly take-home pay for production and

nonsupervisory workers--representing more than 80 percent of all

wage-and-salary employees--has declined by more than 10 percent. <i>The economy

has grown massively since the mid-1960s, but workers' real spendable wages are

no higher now than they were almost thirty years ago</i> [emphasis 

added].</blockquote><p>

Since 1979 only two categories of workers have seen their real hourly earnings

increase: college graduates, who make up just 20 percent of the work force, by

3.5 percent; and those with postgraduate degrees, by 8.8 percent. People with

only "some college education" lost 15.9 percent of their hourly earnings, while

high school dropouts lost 20.6 percent. Of production and nonsupervisory

workers in major industry sectors, construction workers lost 20.7 percent,

manufacturing workers 10.1 percent, transportation and public utilities workers

15.2 percent, and retail workers 17.4 percent. Only workers in finance,

insurance, real estate, and other services (with or without college degrees)

saw any increase in their real hourly wages. <p>



It is often said that wages are falling in all the industrial countries, 

not just in the United States.  That is a counsel of pernicious 

complacency.  Besides, it's not true, and this <A 

HREF="http://stats.bls.gov:80">Bureau of Labor Statistics</A> chart proves 

it.<p>



<A HREF="barchart.htm">The chart</A>--which, because it includes supervisory employees in manufacturing

and not just ordinary workers, shows an anemic gain in wages--returns us to

Gordon's question: Why?<p>



There are two standard answers. One is globalization. U.S. wages are falling

because the new world market for goods and labor is forcing them down. But to

judge by the chart, the same new world market has not kept wages as flat in the

other industrial countries. So, while globalization may have made its

contribution, it can hardly be the major cause of the collapse in American

wages. Moreover, the "trade-and-wages argument"--imports from low-wage

countries caused U.S. wages, especially in manufacturing, to fall--has an

elementary flaw. Gordon wrote that "the bulk of our trade deficit in

merchandise exports and imports, which consists almost entirely of manufactured

goods" is with countries whose manufacturing wages are higher than ours. <p>



The second standard answer is what Gordon called the "skills-mismatch" or

"technology" argument. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich is the leading proponent

of this argument, which according to Gordon is the only serious explanation

other than global trade which economics offers for the wage crisis. To quote

Reich: "[There is a] mismatch between the skills Americans have and the skills

the economy requires." This certainly fits with the fact that Americans with

college or postgraduate degrees are doing much better than those without them.

Thus the answer to the wage crisis is to raise the skill level of the

nonsupervisory work force.<p>



That's logical enough--and a good idea in any case. But, Gordon's critical

review of the literature demonstrates, the technology argument has only

circumstantial evidence to support it--as its more candid proponents concede.

Grant, for example, that computerization brought about the relative increase in

the earnings of computer-literate college grads. Computerization caught on in

the mid-1980s. "But the real earnings of male college graduates actually began

to fall in absolute terms after 1987," Gordon wrote, as the wage crisis crept

up the income scale. In fact, from 1983 to 1993 real hourly wages fell or

stagnated for those workers the Bureau of Labor Statistics identified as

"computer operators" and "engineering technicians," while they climbed 31.2

percent for doctors and 29.7 percent for lawyers and judges--hardly high-tech

professionals. After raising a cluster of similarly persuasive objections to

the skills-mismatch explanation for the wage crisis, Gordon asked, "Have we

found a modern version of the story about the emperor with no clothes?" <p>



But if "trade" and "technology" at best only begin to explain the wage crisis,

then what really explains it?<p>

	<font size=5>T</font>HE title of Gordon's first chapter gives the game away:

	 his villain is

"corporate bloat." Thus <i>Fat</i>, which was created to implement a corporate

strategy--namely, <i>Mean</i>. Since the early 1970s, when wages started their

long dip down, American corporations have been following a "Big Stick" strategy

toward their production and nonsupervisory employees. Corporate America's

response to global competition has been to get tough on unions; to lobby hard

and successfully against meaningful increases in the minimum wage; to invent

new categories of workers--contingent, part-time, temporary--who typically get

no health insurance or other benefits and can be hired and fired as needed. At

the same time, it has bulked up with managers and supervisors to monitor

employees whose morale has fallen apace with their wages. Gordon explained the

logic of the Big Stick this way:

<blockquote>Can't trust your workers when left to their own devices? Peer over their

shoulders. Watch behind their backs. Record their movements. Monitor them.

Supervise them. Boss them. Above all else, don't leave them alone. As one

recent study observed, "American companies tend, fundamentally, to mistrust

workers, whether they are salaried employees or blue-collar 

workers."</blockquote><p>

There are about 17 million monitors and supervisors, not including their

secretaries and assistants. They cost the economy $1.3 trillion in compensation

in 1994, or four times the cost of Social Security, and almost exactly what the

federal government collected in all taxes in 1994. This "bureaucratic burden"

is equivalent to $1.00 of a $5.00 six-pack, or $4,000 of a $20,000 car. Of the

industrial economies in Gordon's sample, none, except tragically propinquant

Canada's, carries anything like as heavy a burden. Whereas 13 percent of U.S.

nonfarm workers are managerial and administrative employees, according to the

<i>Yearbook of Labour Statistics</i>, only 4.2 percent of Japanese workers, 3.9

percent of German workers, and 2.6 percent of Swedish workers are in that

category. Had we held our bureaucratic burden to the Japanese percentage,

Gordon calculated, about 10 million workers would have been freed--none dare

call it "downsized"--to do something more valuable in the economy (which almost

anything other than implementing a wasteful strategy would be), realizing a

possible "corporate bureaucratic dividend" of some half a trillion dollars. <p>



The bureaucratic burden mirrors the decline in wages for the 80 percent of the

work force--as it rises, they fall--that is not in the Fat. (To quote Gordon,

"Men who worked at least eight out of ten years as managers during the 1980s

earned 68 percent more than the average earnings for all male workers.") Since

1947 the number of managers and supervisors has exploded by 360 percent, but it

was only in the early 1970s, with the arrival of the Big Stick, that the burden

began to get really heavy. "And for this strategy to work, the power of the

stick-wielders had to be enhanced," Gordon wrote, noting "a massive income

shift, within the total category of wage-and-salary employee compensation, from

production and nonsupervisory earnings to nonproduction and supervisory

salaries." This income shift, all but ignored in the media, was about seven

times as large as the defense buildup of the Carter-Reagan years. Gordon cited

observations from Malcolm Baldridge, who was a Secretary of Commerce in the

Reagan Administration, and Peter Drucker on what the latter called the "gross

overweight around the midriff" of U.S. corporations. On becoming the chief

executive officer of General Electric in the early 1980s John Welch said, "We

were hiring people [just] to read reports of people who had been hired to write

reports."<p>



Hasn't the "downsizing" scythe of the nineties cut this Fat away? Not yet.

Whereas a total of 2.5 million Americans have lost their jobs owing to

corporate restructuring since 1991, the percentage of managers among nonfarm

employees rose from 12.6 in 1989 to 13.6 in 1995. Although many middle managers

have been let go, even more production workers have too, allowing the

percentage of managers to grow. Gordon, complementing the view that James

Fallows expresses about the out-of-touch media in his new book, <i>Breaking the

News</i>, wrote, "The media appear to pay disproportionate attention to

downsizing toward the top rungs of the occupational hierarchy because these

workers are disproportionately their friends and relatives and readers and

listeners." Inconveniently for Gordon's thesis (and for a small city's worth of

families), 1996 began with news of AT&amp;T's plans to lay off thousands of

mostly managerial employees. <p>



It is as if the downsizing revolution were now devouring its perpetrators.

Gordon's thesis made him less sympathetic to their quandary than common

humanity warrants. Managers are people too. A capitalism without workers:is

that where this destructive madness will end? Better Fat and Mean, say I, than

Lean and Mean.<p>



	<font size=5>W</font>HY

did stockholders and boards of directors of corporate America permit the

bureaucratic burden to grow? Is productivity growth higher among our

management-light, non-Big-Stick-wielding industrial competitors? (Hint: yes.)

Why has computerization fed instead of cut the Fat? How have U.S. corporations

that have not used the Big Stick fared relative to their meaner competitors?

Haven't quality-of-work-life programs blunted the stick? (Hint: no.) For the

answers to questions like these, see Gordon's book.

<p>

It ends, as I will, with a list of negative and positive incentives for

corporate America to drop the Big Stick and stop the wage squeeze affecting 80

percent of U.S. workers before it triggers bread riots--and causes goods to

pile up in stores because wage-challenged consumers are unable to buy them. In

a sign that consumer demand is in fact contracting, at least eight major

retailers filed for bankruptcy last year, and analysts were predicting more

filings this year in the wake of the miserable Christmas shopping season, which

saw mainly upscale retailers, who cater to the top 20 percent of the work

force, enjoy good sales. <p>



The biggest negative incentive would be to change the law so that unions can

fight back against the Big Stick. Union membership tracks the decline in wages.

Unions got clobbered in the eighties, when corporate America implemented the

Big Stick and the Reagan Administration staffed the National Labor Relations

Board with conservatives who rejected unfair-labor-practice complaints against

corporations at a record rate. The saddest chart in Gordon's book shows a

straight line running down the page--the decline in union membership from 35

percent of the work force forty years ago to less than 15 percent in 1994. The

union wage, as a study by David Card and Alan B. Krueger, of Princeton

University, has shown, puts upward pressure on all wages, and so all workers

have a stake in union expansion. Gordon recommended simple changes in the law

that would make it easier for unions to organize and would allow all but the

top managerial employees to join. <p>



Among his other recommendations: <p>



<ul><li> Finance Social Security out of general revenues, as most other advanced

countries do, instead of from a separate tax on payrolls, so that employers

would not be able to avoid the tax by hiring temps.<p>



<li> Raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to $6.50 an hour over four years, and index

it to increases in the cost of living. This would give a fillip to wages and

especially to the wages of women, since 58.8 percent of employed women work at

or below the minimum wage. In a numerically surprising analysis, Gordon showed

how the wages of more than 20 million workers have been negatively affected by

the fall in the real value of the minimum wage.<p>



<li> Extend a variety of direct subsidies to firms that drop the Big Stick. How

would a company demonstrate its reform? Perhaps by sharing the fruits of

productivity increases with workers instead of lavishing them on executive pay

raises and corporate dividends.<p>



<li> Mandate vacations of at least three weeks, which, Gordon wrote, would

"contribute to breaking down the artificial distinctions . . . between

full-time and part-time employees," and make other changes in the Fair Labor

Standards Act to enhance the benefits and job security of disposable or

contingent workers, who number upwards of nine million and the growth of whose

presence in the work force since the 1970s dolefully has coincided with the

decline in real wages. <p>

</ul>

These steps make economic sense. The Big Stick <i>is</i> killing the economy.

But corporate America will vigorously fight any such reforms through its

well-funded political arm, the Republican congressional majority. Dick Armey,

the Republican majority leader in the House, says <i>eliminating</i> the

minimum wage is his idea of a moral issue. As for the Democrats, they, too,

depend on corporate campaign contributions. President Clinton won the election

in part by promising to raise the minimum wage, but he reneged to win corporate

support for NAFTA, a kick in the teeth to the low-wage workers who voted for

him in 1992. In a statement indicative of the attitude of the Administration,

Vice President Herbert Hoover Gore, speaking before a New Hampshire chamber of

commerce, benignly depicted AT&amp;T's huge layoffs as a "natural impulse . . .

to change and to become as efficient as possible." <p>



Pat Buchanan doesn't talk this way about corporate downsizing, nor does

Massachusetts Governor William Weld, at the other end of Republican politics.

Word from inside the Clinton Administration is that Dick Morris, the

consultant-guru of Clinton's re-election campaign, who has peddled his

versatile counsel to Republicans like Jesse Helms and Trent Lott, is telling

Cabinet members to stop talking about economic insecurity. The economy is

great, and it's our economy--that's the Morris message that Gore was parroting

in New Hampshire. Under Clinton the Democrats have lost any claim to economic

populism just when circumstances are giving it a new lease on emotion and

plausibility.<p>



We are at a paradoxical moment in economic history, when what is in the broad

interest of all U.S. corporations--well-paid worker-customers--may not be in

the narrow interest of any one corporation. And government, which should assert

the national interest in resolving this paradox, is throwing up its hands. The

relative optimism in Gordon's book springs from the economic facts. The

political facts warrant despair.

<blockquote>

	
	<font size=5>J</font>ohn Maynard Keynes recalled in 1933 that, like most Englishmen, he had been
brought up "to respect free trade not only as an economic doctrine...but almost
as a part of the moral law. I regarded ordinary departures from it as being at
the same time an imbecility and an outrage." And yet, Keynes went on, he was
now firmly of another opinion on the matter. He had come to sympathize "with
those who would minimize, rather than with those who would maximize, economic
entanglement among nations." Britain should aim to be its own master. A policy
of increased national self-sufficiency, he wrote, "is to be considered, not as
an ideal in itself, but as directed to the creation of an environment in which
other ideals can be safely and conveniently pursued."<p>



In the United States of the 1980s, with the foreign-trade issue moving to
center stage, Keynes's words are worth bearing in mind. Political attention to
foreign economic policy is warranted and probably overdue, because the global
economy has been casting longer and more-threatening shadows across the United
States for several years. The terms of the current debate, however, are
fundamentally misleading. The political airwaves reverberate with the conflict
between free trade and protectionism, but that is a false and outmoded choice.
Another, more basic choice about foreign economic policy has been overlooked:
Should the United States sponsor foreign-trade policies designed to restore
U.S. global dominance? Or should we reduce our dependence on a capricious
global economy, concentrating on putting our own house in order without seeking
to be number one in world trade?<p>



I shall argue that we should not seek and do not need to be number one.
Strategies that pursue international primacy not only are economically
unreliable but also pose a political threat to democracy at home and peace
abroad. We should begin instead to work toward greater independence from the
world economy, seeking self-sufficiency not so much for its own sake but, as
Keynes concluded, in order to provide wider domestic room for political
maneuver--opening the space for efforts to forge greater security, democracy,
and equality at home.<p>



But first, why are the current terms of debate--free trade versus
protectionism--so wide of the mark?<p>



Free trade remains the standard by which many policy proposals are judged, even
though they often include interventionist elements. The rhetoric of free trade
still appeals powerfully to President Reagan, despite his Administration's
recent policy shifts from a strong free-trade emphasis to modest policy
intervention seeking export promotion and dollar devaluation. Witness some
representative presidential hyperbole from late 1985:<p>



     "Our trade policy rests firmly on the foundation of free and open markets,
free trade. I, like you, recognize the inescapable conclusion that all of
history has taught: the freer the flow of world trade, the stronger the tides
for human progress and peace among nations."<p>



The logic of the free-trade argument is straightforward: market exchange works
best when markets are most open and competitive. Any barriers impeding the
international movement of goods, services, capital, and workers--whether
tariffs or quotas--will only undermine the effective discipline of market
competition, reducing productive efficiency or raising prices or both. It is in
everyone's interest, both domestically and internationally, to let the
invisible hand of the market pull the strings no matter what the
results--whether a Youngstown or a Singapore.<p>



To generations schooled in neoclassical economics free trade sounds like an
irresistible and probably irrefutable idea. (Who could possibly be against
access to less expensive shoes?) But pure free-trade policies, which are still
used as the intellectual benchmark of the debate, suffer from two critical
flaws.<p>



First, free trade is an idea whose time comes primarily whenever a single
nation dominates the global political economy. As one expression of
laissez-faire economics, free trade reached its first ideological apogee during
the decades of Pax Britannica--the peak period of British dominance of the
world economy, in the mid-nineteenth century. Britain, because no other nations
could yet contest with it economically, richly benefited from the free
circulation of goods within the Empire and beyond. In his magisterial survey of
economic thought and ideology Joseph Schumpeter wrote:<p>



     "The superiority of England's industry in 1840 was unchallengeable for the
calculable future. And this superiority had everything to gain from cheaper raw
materials and foodstuffs. These were no delusions: so satisfied was the nation
with what it took to be the results of this policy that criticism was almost
silenced until the depression of the eighties."<p>



Given the historical parallels between the respective periods of British and
U.S. global dominance, it is little wonder that the rhetoric of free trade
gained such a strong foothold in the United States following the Second World
War. "Like Aequilibrium Britannicum before it," Michael Moffitt concluded in
The World's Money, "Aequilibrium Americanum depended upon the political,
economic and military power of the United States." Indeed, the U.S. share of
global industrial production in 1950, according to the best available data, was
higher than the British share in 1850. Whether under British or under American
auspices, free-trade policies exploited the pliancy and economic subordination
of colonies and junior trading partners, which were effectively forced to
tolerate the open circulation of advantaged and highly attractive imperial
goods.<p>



That kind of international domination is now all but irretrievably lost. The
modern world has nearly 200 nation-states. A number of countries, particularly
those in northern Europe, now rival the United States in per capita income and
are fast gaining on it in worker productivity. Several countries or blocs of
nations, including Japan, the Soviet Union, and the Common Market, have begun
to compete with the United States in absolute economic size and muscle. In the
modern international political economy, barring a miraculous restoration of
U.S. global hegemony (more on this possibility later) it is unrealistic to
expect other nations to tolerate free circulation of U.S. exports if that does
not advance their own economic interests.<p>



Those seem, for better or worse, to be the prevailing political realities. The
second flaw in pure free-trade policies is an economic one. The U.S. economy
has been losing its advantaged position for decades, not just over the past
several years of soaring dollar values. From 1950 to 1979, for example, the
U.S. economy's share of total world trade declined from 17 percent to 11
percent, while the combined Japanese and Common Market shares doubled, rising
from 17 to 34 percent. One of the most important reasons for this declining
advantage has been lagging U.S. productivity growth. From 1960 to 1979, to
focus on the period immediately preceding the rapid rise of the dollar, the
ratio of U.S. manufacturing productivity to that of our leading competitors
fell by 40 percent; in contrast, the same ratio for Japanese manufacturing
increased by 150 percent. Pure free-trade policies would do nothing to reverse
this erosion of comparative advantage--except foster the hope that the
pressures of competition will somehow induce U.S. firms to try harder.<p>



But there is little reason to believe that increasing market competition, by
itself, will reverse the relative productivity decline of the U.S. economy. For
example, the erosion of relative U.S. manufacturing productivity was just as
rapid in the years from 1973 to 1979, when the institution of free exchange
rates intensified international competitive pressures, as it had been in the
previous period of fixed exchange rates, in the 1960s and early 1970s.
Unfettered competition leads to great uncertainty about the future, leaving
many firms reluctant to make long-term investments in their future
productivity--as long as the future looks so unpredictable.<p>



Furthermore, as exports continue to slump and the trade deficit widens, total
demand for U.S. products lags. This leads to lower levels of exploitation of
existing plants and equipment and, other things being equal, to even feebler
productivity growth--since firms use less effectively what they already have in
place. (This effect has been particularly sharp since 1979, as soaring dollar
values have compounded our trade deficits.) Our productivity problems are
amplified, not resolved.<p>


In the meantime, while free-traders wait for the pressures of competition to
spur U.S. business initiative, other governments are providing investment
subsidies, aid in market promotion, selective protection from international
competition, and support for research and development, and their industries are
exploring new products and technologies. "As a result," a recent Business Week
editorial observed, "many businessmen and members of Congress feel strongly
that the U.S. is increasingly a free-trade patsy in a world of protectionist
pickpockets."<p>


In short, if government policy promotes nothing more than free trade and open
markets, the U.S. economy is likely to experience continuing trade deficits, a
loss of employment, and cyclical instability. If it responds simply with
intermittent dollar devaluation, that will add substantially to inflationary
pressures and make financing the federal deficit increasingly difficult. These
arguments do not close the book on the free-trade approach, since it needs to
be compared with its alternatives. But they do suggest that it has serious
political and economic weaknesses. "Market principles and forces have to be
used," Lester C. Thurow concluded in his recent book, The Zero-Sum Solution,
"but 'leaving it to the market' is a recipe for failure." And while we wait,
many voters will, not surprisingly, rebel against the harsh side-effects of
free-trade medicine.<p>



This likelihood, of course, makes the protectionist response politically
salient. The strongest advocates of protectionism are those most politically
sensitive to the plight of U.S. workers displaced by intensifying foreign
competition. Whether through higher trade tariffs or actual quotas on foreign
imports, pure protectionist policies are short-term efforts to cushion the
blows of international economic combat.<p>



The fundamental problem with protectionism, as many free-traders repeatedly
insist, is that the harsh realities will not go away. If anything, they are
likely to grow harsher as a result of protectionist initiatives.<p>



This short-sightedness seems fairly obvious along the economic front. If U.S.
industries are disabled because of increasing competitive disadvantage,
protecting them from international competition without establishing other
policy supports will very probably compound the disadvantages over time.
Afflicted U.S. industries are likely to stand still while their foreign
competitors race ahead. "In short," the Brookings economist Charles Schultze
argues "we will be strongly encouraging these protected industries to become
even more uncompetitive than they are now."<p>



The political problems seem likewise self-evident. If we move toward
more-restrictive trade policies, what is to prevent our chief competitors from
copying us? What is to guarantee that our temporary trade-balance gains in
reduced imports will not be swamped by our subsequent losses in exports? What
is to prevent an increasingly generalized trade war from leading to sharp
contractions in international trade and to an increasingly general economic
slump?<p>


<font size=5>T</font>he choice between free trade and protectionism is hardly inviting. (This may
explain why the critical arguments on both sides of the debate sound more
persuasive than the constructive proposals.) In the end, both positions have an
intrinsic flaw: they treat only the symptoms of America's troubles in the
global economy. Both play a waiting game: free-traders ask us to wait for that
promised moment when open markets and perfect international competition will
finally whip us into competitive shape; protectionists ask us to wait,
period.<p>



Fortunately, these are not our only choices. Their superficiality has driven
many people to consider more-basic solutions to our international economic
problems. Two schools of thought have emerged that share a determination to
change the nature of our economy's links to the global economy. One seeks to
deepen our international involvement through aggressive efforts to restore U.S.
power in the global economy, the other to reduce that involvement through
increasing domestic independence and increasingly cooperative international
economic relations. Each asks not how we can transform our needs to suit
international economic pressures but rather how we can transform those
international economic pressures to suit our needs.<p>



The first of these two alternatives, which I shall call the Staying on Top
strategy, after the book of that title by the conservative analyst Kevin
Phillips, has begun to occupy a position at the center of the political
spectrum. It proposes what Phillips calls a "strategy of industrial
competitiveness."<p>

The Staying on Top strategy relies heavily on export promotion and the promise
of America's growing high-tech industries. (President Reagan, despite his
disavowals, is moving toward this strategy and away from pure free-trade
policies, with his recent promises of selective export supports.) Domestically
the strategy would mean active government intervention to promote public
planning and coordination which would foster large-scale capital investments,
research and development, marketing, and export expansion. Internationally it
would mean aggressive responses to other governments' protectionism and export
subsidies, and attempts to out-hustle and outbid them for markets and favors.
Preoccupied with Japanese success in world markets, the Staying on Top
strategists would have us emulate Japan through intensive business-government
cooperation. "In fact," Kevin Phillips observed, "fierce debate over and
reaction to the Japanese challenge are probably a precondition of our economic
mobilization." Whether expressed in old phrases or in the language of "new
ideas," this general approach is attractive to younger politicians in both
parties--the Gary Harts, Bill Bradleys, and Richard Gephardts among the
Democrats, and proponents of the Conservative Opportunity Society among House
Republicans.<p>


There is a considerable range of emphases within this general approach--from
sophisticated trade planning to pugnacious jingoism. But a common thread runs
through almost all recent discussions within this camp: a determination to
restore the United States as the dominant power in the global economy. The
strategy presupposes that the interests of U.S. citizens are tied to the
relative international strength of the U.S. economy. It takes for granted what
the Business Week Team, writing in The Reindustrialization of America, termed a
"fundamental correlation between the nation's strength as a trader in an
increasingly interdependent world economy, its domestic prosperity, and the
augmented political influence that a competitive economy will enable the United
States to exert around the world." Aggressive images of competition permeate
the discussion. Even an egalitarian like Lester Thurow can lapse into the
language of the high school locker room or the war-room council table: "To be
successful in the world market a country must organize itself to win," Thurow
argued in The Zero-Sum Solution. "From now on Americans will have to learn how
to invade foreign markets with exports from America." And Phillips called for
the "emotional equivalent of war." He wrote:<p>


     "A genuine confrontation...may now be in the offing for the United States:
the challenge of re-establishing our global economic primacy, and doing so in a
world very greatly changed from the era of comfortable American trade and
industrial leadership that obtained before Vietnam."<p>


<font size=5>A</font> second possible strategy would promote a transition away from domestic
dependence on the global economy and toward international cooperation with our
friends and allies abroad. Rather than aiming to beggar our neighbors, it would
concentrate on tending our own front yard--so I call it the Front Yard
strategy. To many readers the very idea may seem archaic, a relic of
nineteenth-century visions of isolation and insulation from an unknown and
threatening world, but that is not an accurate view. The Front Yard strategy
does not propose mindless protectionism. It would pursue more-effective
domestic production of necessities--such as energy clothing, and
transportation--not indulgent succor of backward industries. And it would take
full account of the technical achievements of the modern age. For, indeed,
modern developments make economic self-sufficiency more plausible and
attractive, not less so.<p>



 The initial, short-term steps dictated by the Front Yard strategy are these:<p>


* Chart the sectors of the economy that are experiencing the most rapid
increases in foreign imports, and explore concrete domestic alternatives to
those imports--for example, federal subsidies for developing conservation and
renewable-energy alternatives to imported oil.<p>


* Negotiate trade agreements that not only aim at reductions in tariffs but
also seek multilateral treaties allocating imports and exports for each nation
participating. At the moment we have few such agreements, and those we have are
largely obsolete. We need, in effect, to update the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), first negotiated nearly forty years ago, through
either a new general treaty or a set of bilateral or multilateral agreements.<p>


* Establish programs during the transition to a Front Yard economy which are
aimed at cushioning the costs of adjustment for U.S. workers in affected
industries, emulating (for example) the Japanese program for "structurally
depressed industries."<p>


* Adopt specific proposals such as recently debated legislation for a
domestic-content requirement for automobiles. Such measures are less
protectionist than quotas, because they both encourage production in the United
States--under domestic-content legislation foreign firms would be mandated to
invest and produce in the United States--and expose U.S. enterprises to the
best of foreign technical and managerial practice. (This proposal, despite
widespread sponsorship in the House, has effectively been stalled by opposition
in the Senate and by diffuse free-trade skepticism.)<p>


* Institute plant-closing legislation that could to some degree protect workers
against the sudden flight of capital abroad, by making advance notification and
indemnification provisions for plant shutdowns and sudden shifts of investment
abroad, and by removing current tax incentives for domestic firms to invest
abroad.<p>


These are only short-term steps. The Staying on Top and Front Yard strategies
differ most profoundly in their long-term objectives for foreign economic
policy.<p>



<font size=5>T</font>he first difference concerns productivity growth. The two strategies agree
that faster growth of domestic productivity is the best possible response to
the international economic challenge, and both criticize free-traders and
protectionists alike for failing to address the underlying sources of slow
productivity growth in the U.S. economy. But the two strategies sharply diverge
over how to speed up productivity growth.<p>



The Front Yard strategy builds upon what my colleagues and I call "wage-led
productivity growth," which would strengthen the whole economy by promoting
fuller employment, wage growth, and wage equalization. This strategy would
speed up productivity growth by creating more customers for business, by
pressuring corporations to make more-efficient use of their increasingly costly
labor force, and by giving workers more of a stake in the way their companies
and the broader economy perform. These objectives could be pursued through the
medium term by policies aimed at, for example, faster economic growth, the
creation of a public-jobs program, labor-law reform to reduce barriers to
unionization, a substantial increase in the minimum wage, and legislation to
require equal pay for jobs of comparable worth.<p>



Staying on Top strategists, in sharp contrast, can hardly be accused of
advocating higher wages. When confronted with the prospect of U.S. workers'
having to accept lower-wage employment, they respond with analytic diffidence,
arguing that lower, more-flexible wages are good for the economy--if not for
the workers who earn them. High-tech entrepreneurs are now some of the most
passionate opponents of labor unions in the United States. A Business Week
feature on the "new corporate elite" noted, "With the exception of corporate
rejuvenators who have inherited unions, virtually everyone else in the service
and high-tech areas will do anything to keep organized labor out."<p>



This important difference between the strategies is not simply over the justice
of higher or lower wages; much more critically, it is over the most effective
strategy for increasing economic efficiency. Improving international
competitiveness depends on changes in unit labor costs--which are a product of
both wage costs and labor productivity--and not just on changes in relative
wage levels. One can therefore seek to improve the competitive position of U.S.
industries through efforts to reduce wage growth or to increase productivity
growth. My colleagues Samuel Bowles and Thomas E. Weisskopf and I have argued
not only that rapid productivity growth helps create room for continuing wage
growth but also, more important, that rapid wage growth and wage equalization
can help foster productivity growth and actually improve the competitive
position of the United States. Since rapid wage growth and wage equalization
would benefit the vast majority of Americans, wage-led productivity growth has
great potential political appeal. But where would the money to finance both
wage growth and more rapid investment come from? In our book, Beyond the Waste
Land, we argue that both investment and wage growth could be financed by the
dividends provided by a more stable high-growth economy.<p>



In the current anti-union political climate these arguments may seem
counterintuitive. But historical experience suggests that they are plausible.
The example of a number of European countries in the postwar period, it can be
argued, indicates that rapid wage growth can help stimulate rapid productivity
growth, and therefore that rapid wage growth accompanied by rapid productivity
growth is consistent with significant increases in an economy's shares of world
production and trade. Even in the postwar United States there have been short
periods when rapid wage growth has been consistent with improving international
competitiveness. From 1960 to 1966, for example, real hourly earnings in U.S.
manufacturing rose at an average annual rate of 3.1 percent a
year--fructiferous growth compared with the actual decline in real hourly
earnings from 1978 to 1984. Those rapid wage gains did not keep the relative
competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing firms, measured by their relative unit
labor costs, from improving over those same six years-- at an average annual
rate of 2.6 percent. How was that possible? Productivity growth was more rapid
than wage growth, AND the difference was greater for us than for our
competitors.<p>



There is more than a simple coincidence of numbers in these experiences. When
workers are faced with demands for wage concessions and threats of job loss,
they commonly resist efforts at improving productivity through either
technological change or work reorganization. But when offered job security and
promises of stable wage growth in the proper management climate, they can
actually take the initiative in spurring productivity growth. At the huge,
reorganized auto-assembly plant in Fremont, California, for example, the new
(joint) Toyota-General Motors management team has provided contractual
guarantees of job security which are the strongest in the U.S. auto industry,
substantial increases in fringe benefits, and advance consultation with workers
on layoffs, production-schedule changes, and major investments (wages
themselves are protected at prevailing U.S. industry-wide union scales).
Workers have responded enthusiastically to the changes in the work climate,
cooperating through work teams to try to improve the quality and the speed of
output. The key is the workers' stake in the future of the enterprise. Bruce
Lee, the union regional director, concludes, "We've ensured that the positive
attitude and commitment [management] expects from our members is matched by
respect for and attention to the needs and desires of the workers."<p>



But aren't U.S. workers' wages too high in any case? Critics often point their
fingers at the U.S. auto and steel industries, in which production workers'
wages are arguably the highest in the world. Don't these two examples
demonstrate the risks of rapid wage growth? In fact it appears that poor
management strategy not excessive workers' wages, was the principal long-term
cause of the erosion of those industries' international positions. Ira C.
Magaziner and Robert B. Reich concluded in Minding America's Business that "the
U.S. steel industry's underlying assumptions about the steel business prevented
it from making the aggressive investments in modernization that were needed to
match the pace of Japanese investment." Especially in recent years, lagging
relative productivity, not rising relative wages, has been the chief problem in
both industries. For example, U.S. auto workers' real average hourly wages
declined by more than five percent from 1978 to 1984, while real earnings for
their Japanese counterparts increased by nearly nine percent. Why did the cost
advantages of Japanese cars improve so dramatically over this period? Japanese
productivity continued to increase while U.S. productivity stagnated. And the
rising value of the dollar relative to the yen added another 14 percent to the
cost advantages of imported cars.<p>



<font size=5>A</font> second difference between the Staying on Top and Front Yard strategies
involves plotting our trade targets. Staying on Top strategists argue in favor
of accepting increasing international economic interdependence as a fact of
modern life and of expanding exports to the rest of the world, while Front Yard
strategists propose that we begin a slow transition toward greater economic
self-sufficiency in those goods and services we need most.<p>



Some statistics can help clarify how the strategies differ. In 1966 imports
totaled 4.9 percent of the gross national product, exports 5.5 percent. By 1984
the import share had doubled to 9.8 percent while the export share was lagging
at 8.9 percent, resulting in a net goods-and-services trade deficit, in 1984
dollars, of $64.2 billion. The Staying on Top strategy would have us close the
widening gap between imports and exports through aggressive efforts to increase
the rate of growth of exports while tolerating the continuing growth in
imports. The Front Yard strategy in contrast, calls for reducing both the
export and the import share over the long term, while reducing the import share
by a somewhat wider margin. The former strategy would reinforce the trend
toward increasing trade dependence; the latter would reverse it.<p>



In one sense, the difference between the two approaches reflects little more
than a difference in time horizon and orientation. Take the case of imported
oil and the aftermath of the OPEC price hikes of 1973 and 1979. One response to
the immediately higher costs of imports was to seek compensating increases in
our exports--searching vigorously for commodities such as grain, arms, and
computers for which we could find new markets abroad. Another approach could
have placed a higher priority than the government did during the 1970s on
reducing our dependence on imported oil--through invigorated
energy-conservation programs and an emphasis on locally available and renewable
sources of energy like solar and geothermal power. The former strategy might
work over the short term but is likely to lose effectiveness over the longer
term, because international markets and prices periodically shift. The latter
strategy has clear promise for both the short and the long term, because it
would more or less permanently lessen our demand for a substance that is a
significant component of our import bill. The former would require that we
continually adjust to unexpected shocks from beyond our borders. The latter
would gradually reduce our exposure to such shocks.<p>



More generally, the two strategies reflect quite different evaluations of the
characteristics of world trade and world markets. Staying on Top strategists
tout the benefits of international trade and often, though they are hardly pure
free-traders, argue the comparative advantages of adjusting to world prices and
supplies. But we should not necessarily allow our lives to be dictated by
prices and supplies elsewhere--as if they were some magic measure of productive
efficiency. The unit labor costs of imported goods may sometimes be lower
because of more efficient production practices (as is now true of some Japanese
goods) or because of lower standards of living. But they may also be lower
because those goods are produced or extracted under authoritarian regimes where
workers have few or no rights. Should U.S. citizens unequivocally embrace the
lower-cost goods produced in South Korea, where trade unions are reduced to
chattel organizations? We need to discriminate carefully among the sources of
low-cost imports. When imported goods are less expensive because of more
effective production techniques, as with many Japanese goods, we should respond
by improving our domestic production. But when imported goods are less
expensive because of limits on workers' wages and bargaining rights, we should
think carefully about the appropriate response.<p>



Trade decisions are intrinsically political. If we practice free trade by
allowing perfect access to goods produced anywhere, then we run the risk of
corroding our own democratic institutions by exposing U.S. workers to the
lowest common denominator of foreign competition. Pressures can grow to reduce
workers' access to trade unions, to narrow unions' and workers' rights to
influence workplace conditions, to expose workers to hazardous working
conditions. U.S. workers already have fewer rights than unionized workers in
northern Europe (which has outcompeted us for years). Indiscriminate responses
to import competition, such as blanket reductions in wages and benefits, can
only make matters worse.<p>



The proper response is not to exclude every commodity produced under
distasteful conditions but to plan foreign-trade needs and opportunities. We
must constantly weigh the trade-offs between access to inexpensive commodities
and the political and social implications of that access. Where the trade-off
is most unfavorable to our democratic institutions and our standard of living,
we should seek to reduce our dependence on those foreign commodities--not
simply by excluding them but by improving the quality or reducing the costs of
substitutes produced at home. We should not allow politics or poverty abroad to
dictate our politics at home.<p>



But doesn't economic logic require that each country specialize in the
production of commodities in which it has a special comparative advantage? Up
to this point I have argued that such advantages are contingent, subject to
continual re-evaluation and, if necessary for political reasons, alteration.
But an additional point is pertinent here: One of the chief implications of
rapid technological change is that it continually narrows the "rooted"
geographic variations among nations in their potential productivity. Climatic
differences can often be transcended. The increasing potential of renewable
energy sources reduces the importance of fixed deposits of minerals. Computer
technology can help to diffuse the potential for advanced technological
production. More and more of what matters in labor productivity can be
reproduced almost anywhere.<p>



What counts, again, is unit labor cost. If we apply our vast economic wealth to
continual productive investments, providing our workers with the most advanced
equipment possible, we can improve the relative productivity of American
manufacturing without increasing the costs of our goods to U.S. consumers. And
through careful strategic planning we can gradually increase the percentage of
consumed goods and services that we produce domestically, reducing our exposure
to insidious political and economic pressures, transmitted through
international markets, from oppressive regimes and poor countries. A staff
report of the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the U.S. House of
Representatives recently concluded,<p>


     "The final major goal of international economic policy involves the
question of national sovereignty....While realism requires flexibility in the
face of international competition, the U.S. cannot agree to abandon its
standard of living or its traditional commitment to restrain exploitation of
child labor, preserve the health of its work-force, protect its environment,
provide retired, unemployed, or handicapped citizens with an adequate level
income....If we permit ourselves to become locked into the competitive "race to
the bottom" we will inevitably lose control over the most basic social and
political aspects of our national life."<p>



<font size=5>T</font>he third principal difference between the Staying on Top and Front Yard
strategies involves our priorities in relationships with other nations and
people abroad. History should have taught us by now that the aggressive pursuit
of foreign economic advantage can easily compromise the pursuit of
international peace. Keynes put it delicately when he wrote, in the 1930s,<p>



     "It does not now seem obvious that a great concentration of national
effort on the capture of foreign trade, that the penetration of a country's
economic structure by the resources and the influence of foreign capitalists
and that a close dependence of our own economic life on the fluctuating
economic policies of foreign countries are safeguards and assurances of
international peace. It is easier, in the light of experience and foresight, to
argue quite the contrary."<p>



The imperatives of neither experience nor foresight have changed since the
1930s. The neo-conservative thinker Irving Kristol was candid about the
connections between economic and military policy in a 1979 article:<p>



     "The 1980s will see a disintegrating international order in which economic
growth is going to be extraordinarily difficult to achieve....It will therefore
have to be an overriding goal of American foreign policy to help shape this
world....What will be relevant is an American foreign policy in which power,
and the readiness to use it boldly, will play a far more central role than has
ever before been the case in our history...Our economic growth will henceforth
be as dependent on our foreign policy as on our economic policy....Today it is
military rearmament that is the first priority, economic as well as
political."<p>


Obviously, considering the historical experience of the twentieth century,
reduced dependence on foreign trade would promote peaceful international
relations better than would an aggressive pursuit of foreign markets and
favored trading relations. These conclusions will remain mere pieties, however,
unless they are coupled with policies that will alter the calculus of
foreign-trade advantage. If we value the quest for peace, then we should also
reduce the economic interests--yours and mine and our neighbors'--that are
vested in taking advantage of lower costs and attractive resources around the
globe. Do some Americans lust for the restoration of privileged access to
bounteous Middle Eastern oil fields? Then we should intensify our efforts to
conserve domestic energy and develop renewable-energy alternatives. Without
such efforts international peace remains vulnerable to potential conflicts in
the oil-rich Persian Gulf, which the Carter Doctrine commits us to defend.<p>


<font size=5>T</font>he staying on top and front yard strategies can both be distinguished from
free-trade strategies, because both favor government intervention to shape our
links to international markets. Neither is purely protectionist, because each
would improve the relative economic attractiveness of U.S.-manufactured goods
and not merely protect endangered species. Neither is more ambitious or more
practical than the other, for both propose major transformations in the shape
of our foreign economic policy. Of the two, the Front Yard strategy seems
preferable, for the three reasons I have argued.<p>

<p>

And yet many people have become so accustomed to the language if not the logic
of free trade or export promotion that the arguments in favor of the Front Yard
strategy may seem beside the point. What about the U.S. consumer? Won't any
interference with the market raise the costs to the U.S. consumer? Won't
reduced trade dependence ruin him? Won't somebody have to pay the price of
transition to the Front Yard economy?<p>



First, the Front Yard strategy, like the Staying on Top strategy but unlike
simple protectionism, aims primarily to reduce the cost attractiveness of
foreign imports by improving the competitiveness of domestically produced
goods, not to prevent U.S. consumers from buying them. Unless one believes that
there is no way public policy can help improve the productivity of U.S.
enterprise--a notion that would amuse the Japanese--the most important choice
we face is not between consumers' costs and workers' jobs or wages, since
more-rapid productivity growth would help both, but how best to strengthen our
domestic economic foundations.<p>



Second, free-traders' repeated alarms about consumer choice often suggest that
U.S. workers and consumers are somehow two entirely different groups, with
sharply conflicting interests. But mostly they are the same people. Suppose
that import competition lowers the average cost of living to consumers by two
percent. But suppose further that we respond to it by forcing or tolerating a
decline in the average worker's earnings by two percent. The average worker is
no better off than before. (From 1979 to 1984, while the shift to imports
helped bring down the rate of inflation, private nonfarm nonsupervisory
employees, who make up five sixths of all U.S. private nonfarm employees,
witnessed a DECLINE in the real purchasing power of their earnings of 2.7
percent.) The only people who are better off are those consumers whose earnings
are not sensitive to import competition.<p>



But--and this raises a third point--how long can even the most insulated
earners and consumers continue to prosper while other workers join the
unemployment lines? It is worth recalling a legendary exchange between a Ford
Motor Company plant manager and Walter Reuther, the longtime president of the
United Auto Workers. The manager was boasting about his newly automated plant:
"Well, Reuther, how are you going to collect dues from these machines?"
Reminding the manager of his firm's dependence on consumer purchasing power,
Reuther retorted, "How are you going to sell your cars to these machines?"<p>



The story's moral still applies. In what economists call a closed
economy--neglecting the impact of foreign trade for a moment--firms benefit
from both lower prevailing wages, through lower costs, and higher prevailing
wages, through expanding consumer demand. Some balance between the two is
needed. Rising productivity growth can help create wider margins within which
to find the proper balance.<p>



In an open economy--taking international effects into account--the need for
balance remains. If domestic workers suffer real declines in their purchasing
power, protected earners must assume that foreign buyers will make up the
difference in total demand for U.S. goods and services, buying enough of them
to support those who benefit from lower import prices. But that depends, in
turn, on U.S. buyers' having the purchasing power to buy foreign goods--which
depends in the end on the levels of U.S. workers' earnings. Other countries
cannot tolerate continuing trade deficits any more than we can.<p>



The point, then, is that free-traders' repeated reminders about "consumers" are
one-sided: they fail to heed some basic economic principles about balance at
home and in the world economy. Both the Staying on Top and the Front Yard
strategy are concerned with improving the terms of that balance over time.<p>

<p>

But there the similarities end. The Staying on Top strategy could lead toward
increasing pressure on workers' rights in the United States and greater
international tension. The Front Yard strategy would concentrate instead on
nurturing our economic welfare and democratic rights at home and would eschew
the temptation to take advantage of others' vulnerability or weakness. The
choice is not easy, but it is ours. <p>

<blockquote>
	<i><font size=4>With most jobs being created at the top and the bottom of the ladder, America may have difficulty remaining a middle-class society
</i></font><p>
	
	
	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	
	<font size=5>T</font>here is a good deal of evidence that job opportunities in the United States are polarizing, and that, as a result, the country's future as a middle-class society is in jeopardy. What the decline of the middle class would mean to the country can only be guessed at, but it presumably would be unwelcome to the millions of parents who hope that their children can move up the economic ladder; to American business, which needs a middle class to consume its products; and to everyone who is concerned about fairness and social harmony.<P>
As the economy shifts away from its traditional manufacturing base to high-technology and service industries, the share of jobs providing a middle-class standard of living is shrinking. An industrial economy employs large numbers of relatively well-paid production workers. A service economy, however, employs legions of keypunchers, salesclerks, waiters, secretaries, and cashiers, and the wages for these jobs tend to be comparatively low.<P>
This increasing concentration of jobs at the extremes of the country's range of earnings is an issue quite distinct from high unemployment--the most visible threat facing the work force today. It is also an issue distinct from the country's poor rate of economic growth. Restoring growth may make "everyone" better off, statistically, but growth by itself has little bearing on the distribution of wages. Moreover, the government's existing income-support programs simply are not designed to address this new problem. The fact is that statistically, most dollars of government transfer income go to the elderly, through Social Security and Medicare. Thus, even counting all the welfare checks and food stamps for the poor, and all the dividend coupons, interest payments, and capital gains for the rich, the working-age population still depends on jobs for fully 85 percent of its income.<P>
During the three decades after World War II, real income grew steadily, along with the number of good jobs. Between 1958 and 1968, manufacturing added 4 million jobs; state and local government added another 3.5 million. The child of a working-class family who graduated from high school in the 1950s and 1960s could choose among a number of relatively well-paid jobs--precisely the jobs that are disappearing now. Manufacturing, which pays on average almost three times the minimum wage, added fewer than a million jobs between 1968 and 1978, and has lost nearly 3 million jobs over the past four years. Construction and production work, taken together, account for about one job in eight today, compared with one in four in 1950. According to Barry Bluestone, a professor of economics at Boston College and co-author of the book The Deindustrialization of America, "The pattern of wages in the old, mill
based economy looked just like a normal bell curve. It had a few highly paid jobs at the top, a few low-wage jobs at the bottom, and plenty of jobs in the middle. But in the new services economy, the middle is missing."<P>
The erosion of the middle of the labor market is easy to misinterpret, because its roots are multiple. During the 1970s, the entry into the work force of an unprecedented number of women and of young adults born during the baby boom resulted in too many workers for the jobs available, and depressed wages. The decline of the middle also has something to do with the explosive growth in world trade since 1960. As manufacturing technologies have become more mobile, and multinational firms more footloose, production jobs have migrated from the U.S. to countries where wages are low. In addition, technology itself has helped to provoke the shifts in the job market. For example, fewer American workers would have been needed to make steel in 1980 than in 1960 even if the pressures of global competition had not been a factor, because new machines have made many of their tasks redundant. Finally, the high rate of unemployment caused by these trends has tended to drive wages down further, especially at the low end, since it forces unskilled workers to compete for their jobs with unemployed people who are willing to do the work for less.<P>
Although demographic shifts, stepped-up world trade, unemployment, and especially the advance of technology all have had an effect on the shape of the job market, middle-level jobs have been disappearing ultimately as a result of the ways in which technological gains are being distributed. When a machine replaces a production worker, both the firm and consumers as a group benefit. The loss falls mainly on the worker who is displaced. If that loss is generalized to millions of high-paid workers, they suffer as a group, and the economy as a whole suffers a loss of worker purchasing power. Thus the lack of a mechanism to distribute some of the financial gains from technology to the work force comes back to haunt the entire economy.<P>
As it happens, production work is becoming heavily automated at a time when the most powerful agents of distribution--the trade-union movement and the public sector--are in decline. There is nothing intrinsic in assembling cars, mining coal, or pouring molten steel that requires high wages. These jobs do pay well mainly because of the efforts of strong unions. Just as high wages are not a necessary characteristic of factory work, low wages are not a necessary characteristic of a service economy. But because unions have organized few fast-food workers, typists, bank clerks, or even computer assemblers, most of the new service jobs that are replacing factory work pay far lower wages. And the chief realm of a service economy in which wages are good--public service (teaching, social work, nursing, and so forth)--can no longer be relied on to take up the slack. Although the number of jobs funded by state and local government grew substantially throughout the 1960s and 1970s, it peaked in 1980, and had fallen by 200,000 at the end of 1981--the most recent year for which figures are available. Whether or not one favors strong unions or the pervasive presence of government in society, unions and government undeniably have operated as instruments of a relatively egalitarian distribution of wages. As their influence declines, so does their impact on the national pattern of earnings.<P>
<BR>

Labor statistics show that wage and salary income is becoming more unequally distributed in the economy as a whole, and in service industries in particular. It also turns out that the fastest-growing industries are those with the most extreme wage spread.<P>
The Bureau of Labor Statistics ranks earnings in ascending order by percentile. Thus, a worker at the eightieth percentile makes more money than 79.9 percent of the rest of the population. A study conducted in 1980 by two economists at the department of Labor, Peter Henle and Paul Ryscavage, found that between 1958 and 1977, the earnings of men at the twentieth percentile increased by 130.6 percent (with no adjustment for inflation), but the earnings of men at the eightieth percentile increased by 206.7 percent. The book Services: The New Economy, by Thomas M. Stanback, Jr., and three colleagues, published in 1981, concludes, "For services as a whole, the most important observation is that there tends to be a heavy concentration of employment in better-than-average and in poorer-than-average jobs. In contrast, in manufacturing and construction, the distributions are more heavily weighted toward medium and above
average jobs."<P>
Statisticians at the Department of Labor have been comparing the salaries paid in the twenty fastest-growing occupations with those in the twenty that are in the sharpest decline. Although their results will not be released in full until later this year, Ronald Kutscher, an assistant commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, says that workers in the fastest-growing industries are earning, on average, $5,000 a year LESS than workers in industries that are declining or that are growing most slowly.<P>
There is, of course, independent evidence of widening inequality in America, apart from changes in the distribution of jobs. The number of Americans living in poverty, which dropped to about 23 million in 1974, is greater than 30 million today. The 20 percent of households in the country's highest tax brackets take 41.9 percent of all income paid in the U.S.--the highest share in two decades. Paradoxically, the entry of more women into the labor force has exaggerated the inequality of family incomes. On average, the working wife of a man who makes $50,000 earns $5,000 more than the working wife of a man who makes $10,000. Homeownership, for years the badge of membership in the middle class, has become a nearly impossible feat for those who do not have a house already. A new house of average price is beyond the budgets of more than 75 percent of all households.<P>
One might fault the Reagan Administration for cutting taxes at the top and social programs at the bottom, but the widening polarization of the labor force remains a phenomenon distinct from these policies and largely ignored in the national debate. Long after the Reagan Administration ends, this problem will plague the American economy.<P>
In 1982, the Department of Labor ranked the number of actual job openings in 1980 by category. These openings reflect turnover as well as net job growth. The top fifteen job categories, with a single exception, are ones that middle-class parents hope their children will avoid:<P>

Of the top fifteen, only one, the grab-bag category "Managers and administrators (not elsewhere classified)," suggests a well-paid line of work. The first profession to appear on the department's roster is job number thirty-six, accountants, with 140,108 openings. Far down on the list come computer programmers (30,963) and electrical engineers (23,089). According to the most recent comprehensive forecast of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, released in 1982, the economy will generate some 19 million new jobs between 1980 and 1990, about 3.5 million of which will be "professional and technical." Low-wage service and clerical work will account for almost 7 million new jobs.<P>
Within the manufacturing sector, the job structure of the one major growth industry--microelectronics--is highly stratified. Computer scientists and engineers typically have more than a college degree and earn $30,000 a year and more. The workers who assemble computers, however, earn about $12,000 a year. The number of skilled technicians whose wages fall between these two extremes is surprisingly small. The rate of productivity of the electronics industry is accelerating so fast, in fact, that electronics is not expected to be an important source of new production jobs, good or bad. The more significant effect of the computer on work is being realized not in the computer's manufacture but in its application. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the U.S. will require about 120,000 more computer programmers and 125,000 more electrical engineers during the next decade, but it will require some 3 million more secretaries and office clerks.<P>
By 1990, 600,000 more janitors, 500,000 more salesclerks, and 400,000 more fast-food workers will also be needed. To be sure, the economy has always included low-wage service jobs, but in the past it also included a larger middle range of relatively well-paid production jobs. These were the jobs that created the postwar, blue-collar middle class. Today, a welding job in an automobile plant is performed more cheaply by a robot or a foreigner; that job once paid somebody $12 an hour, and there are few openings at $12 an hour in restaurants, hotels, or computer-assembly plants.<P>
Given the 10 percent unemployment rate, it is tempting to conclude that lots of low-wage, "entry-level" service jobs are just what the economy needs. Unfortunately, although these jobs do provide an entry into the work force, few offer opportunities for advancement. The fast-food industry, for example, employs a small number of executives, and hundreds of thousands of cashiers and kitchen help who make about $3.50 an hour. With some variation, keypunchers, chambermaids, and retail sales personnel confront the same short job ladder.<P>
<BR>

Statistics do not do justice to the story. A look at actual offices, stores, and factories is even more revealing. The Boston area, with its heavy concentration of financial services (banking, credit reporting, real estate, and so forth) and high-technology firms, can serve as a model of where the economy as a whole is headed. To get a practical glimpse of the emerging labor market, I interviewed personnel executives at several companies there.<P>
The work force of financial-service industries grew 32 percent, to 5.4 million, between 1973 and 1982--a period when durable manufacturing lost workers. At Blue Cross Blue Shield, which falls within this sector of the economy, the work force grew 46 percent, to 88,000, between 1970 and 1982. As in most insurance companies, the main activity of Blue Cross Blue Shield is collecting premiums and paying claims. Computerization and remote data transmission have made these tasks more routine and have allowed them to be performed almost anywhere.<P>
The company's offices in Massachusetts employ about 4,000 people, of whom some 400 are rated managers, another 1,000 are rated professionals (attorneys, actuaries, programmers, doctors, nurses), and some 2,600 are rated clericals. According to Theron R. Bradley, who oversees employee training for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, computerization has not had the same effect on everyone who works for the company. For professionals like him, it has provided new possibilities. Bradley says, "As the manager of training, if I wonder who in the company has taken which courses, I can have the computer research that at the touch of a button. If I need to analyze the results of testing, I can have the computer produce research that I could not have imagined allocating the resources for a short time ago. Our accountants can now spend their time doing what they were trained to do--setting up accounting systems and interpreting the results. In the past, a lot of their work was glorified bookkeeping." At the same time, however, the computer has had a different effect on Blue Cross Blue Shield's large clerical force. Bradley says, "In the past, the lowest six levels of our clerical structure looked like an inverted pyramid. At the very bottom were jobs like filing, sorting, mail delivery, and basic data-entry jobs. You'd almost have to try not to be promoted in order to avoid rising through the clerical ranks. Most people did get promoted. With good oral and written communication skills, you could move fairly easily into a supervisory or junior management job. Those senior clerical jobs are disappearing, because the computer is taking over so much of the decision-making. We have a lot more routine jobs at the bottom, and a few more complex jobs at the top, where you need someone to analyze hundreds of pages of data."<P>
Blue Cross Blue Shield's largest job category is that of claims examiner. The company recently opened "outreach" offices in the towns of Plymouth and Rockland, outside Boston, to house the newly organized Blue Shield claims department. The work is part-time, in order to attract mothers of young children, students, and others who will accept reduced hours. As it turns out, all of the claims examiners on the day shift at Plymouth are women. The day shift runs from eight until two. "You can drop Junior off at school, and drop down to our office at the local shopping mall," Bradley explains. Each clerk sits at a computer screen with a pile of claims, and types in the subscriber's name or number, the code number of the medical procedure claimed, the fee, and the identification number of the doctor. The computer verifies that the subscriber is covered. A different department handles more complicated claims, and still another mails out reimbursement checks.<P>
A claim takes about a minute to process, and a good clerk can dispatch 300 a day; the computer keeps track of productivity. On average, the clerks are paid between $4.50 and $5.75 an hour, but wages are adjusted every two months to reflect each clerk's output. Blue Shield provides a fifteen-minute paid lunch break and a week of vacation after one year. It provides no health insurance.<P>
When the company announced its plans to move to Plymouth, a Blue Shield Day was held at a local vocational high school to recruit applicants. Bradley says. "We locate these offices in areas of high labor demand so that we don't have to outbid everybody else's wages. We have no trouble finding people. Every time we open one, we are swamped with applications."<P>
According to one of the clerks at Plymouth, who requested anonymity, few of the women who began work with her at the office when it opened, in March of 1982, are there today. The most demoralizing thing about the job, she says, is the isolation. Virtually all communication is between the clerk and the machine. Since pay is based on output and the job itself requires no human interaction, there is every incentive to keep social conversation to a minimum. "Last Christmas," my informant says, "they organized a little office party. They had a 'Christmas Grab,' where everybody picks a name out of a hat. You bring in a little gift for somebody and they bring one in for you. We realized that nobody knew anyone else's name."<P>
The new system has indeed improved the productivity of the company's claims department, but more intensive use of technology and higher output have not translated into better jobs. Despite the space-age technology, each clerk can be trained in only four weeks. The work is more routine, and the company's labor costs are lower.<P>
<BR>

It is intriguing to consider whether the loss of middle-income jobs reflects technological imperatives or merely management preferences. Much has been written on the tendency of technology to degrade work, but there are enough instances to the contrary to suggest that managers have substantial latitude in how they choose to reorganize work.<P>
Banks provide examples of technology both making work more tedious and making work more challenging. Like armies, banks divide their troops into officers and enlisted personnel. Behind every officer is a cadre of back
room clerks. Although in theory the lowliest teller can aspire to be an officer, in practice there is little opportunity to move up from the clerical force into the officer ranks. For example, First National Bank of Boston, the nation's seventeenth largest bank, hires about a hundred people a year for its loan-officer-development program. As many as ten may be promoted from within. Most new loan officers, however, are recent graduates of colleges or business schools. The competition is keen, and the bank will pay more than $30,000 to attract a promising MBA holder. Clerical workers at First National outnumber officers by more than two to one. The 621 tellers earn an average salary of $6.69 an hour, or about $263 a week, and below that rank there are thousands of other, lower-paid clerical jobs.<P>
One job that has become more routine as a result of technology is that of money-transfer clerk. Like most banks, First National has automated its money-transfer operation, plugging into a computer-connected network. When a customer requests that money be transferred from one bank to another, the clerk punches up a standard format on the computer terminal, checks whether funds are available, enters the number of the bank to receive the funds, and electronically consummates the transaction. According to Steven Bavaria, the bank's vice president in charge of personnel, "We are able to use more junior people for transfers since that was automated. We even use some part-time high school students. Because we build more safeguards into the system, the people operating it can concentrate all their attention on five or six variables: the account number, the amount of money being transferred, the name of the bank, and so on, rather than having to type and proofread an entire Telex message."<P>
In contrast, the computerization of First National's letter-of-credit department has upgraded the status of several dozen employees. A letter of credit is a document from the bank to a foreign supplier's bank, guaranteeing payment for goods that are about to be shipped. Formerly, processing a letter of credit involved assembling pieces of paper, with a chain of clerks verifying shipping and credit documents and typing forms. Now the bank's letter-of-credit department is mostly what Bavaria terms "junior professionals," each with a computer terminal. "The same person can review the documents. create the file, send the letter, and, when we have verification that the order has been shipped, authorize payment." Bavaria says. Most letter-of-credit employees earn between $300 and $400 a week, and the position is sometimes a way station in the officer
training program.<P>
Gross statistics on the earnings of clerical workers nationwide suggest that this kind of upgrading is unusual. The vast majority of clerks, men and women, earn less than $300 a week. For full-time female clerical workers, the average weekly salary in 1980 was about $220. Of the total 17 million female clerical workers, fewer than 500,000 earned as much as $400 a week. Fewer than a million earned more than $335. The study by Henle and Ryscavage indicates that clerical wages are becoming increasingly skewed to the low end of pay scales.<P>
Retail sales is another growth industry in which wages are clustering more and more at the extremes. The number of people working in the Department of Labor's "wholesale and retail trade" category has grown from 8.7 million in 1950 to more than 18 million today. In 1981, nonsupervisory workers in trade and retailing earned an average of about $150 a week. The 2.4 million salesclerks earned an average of $178 a week, and the 410,000 manufacturers' sales representatives earned an average of $434.<P>
In theory, the shift to an economy based on services and information ought to be compatible with the equitable distribution of income and jobs. Substituting technology for human labor makes the country as a whole richer. Some economists argue that as the economy grows more productive, technology will gradually eliminate many routine, dead-end jobs, replacing them with high-skill positions and more leisure time for all. The market does not necessarily convert rising productivity into an acceptable distribution of income and leisure, however. The pattern of development in much of the Third World demonstrates that it is quite possible for an economy to attain a high rate of growth based on rapid technological progress, and still function as a society in which one half of the work force waits on the other half, and makes a good deal less. Low wages tend to foster more low wages. If you have to pay a welder $12 an hour, it may make economic sense to substitute capital for labor and build an automated welding machine. But if fast-food workers cost only $3.50 an hour, automation may be a long time coming. It is often the high-paying jobs that are replaced by machines, not the low-paying ones.<P>
<BR>

Few economists expect the booming high-technology field to be an important source of new jobs: its productivity is too high. According to projections by Data Resources, Inc., a corporate consulting firm, the entire high-tech industry, broadly defined, will provide fewer than a million new jobs over the next decade. The American Electronics Association projects that the number of jobs for skilled electronics technicians will grow by only about 15,000 a year. Moreover, the relatively low-skill assembly jobs in microelectronics plants, which do not pay well to begin with, are rapidly being automated or shifted to countries in which wage scales are even lower.<P>
The Hewlett-Packard Company--a California-based manufacturer of computers, computer software, scientific instruments, and testing devices, with assets totaling about $4.3 billion--offers a good example of technology's effect on the high-tech labor force. The company prides itself on "the Hewlett-Packard way"--an informal style of management with few barriers between the executive suite and the shop floor.<P>
The medical-products group, one of five major corporate divisions, makes an array of sophisticated electronic monitoring devices used by hospitals to analyze blood chemistry, to monitor fetal functions, and to check heartbeat, blood pressure, and oxygen intake. It employs some 2,700 people in two plants near Boston. During the past two years, the number of engineers and computer scientists at the company has grown by about 1,250 nationwide, but few technicians or assembly workers have been hired. Despite the group's steady growth in sales, averaging between 15 and 20 percent a year, productivity has also been rising so rapidly that the company has barely avoided layoffs.<P>
Hewlett-Packard's large plant in the suburban town of Waltham occupies a long, low, brick building. The shop floor is quiet, clean, and well lit. There is no assembly line. In the main section of the floor, employees sit at benches attaching the final few components to printed circuit boards that have been produced mainly by machines elsewhere in the plant. James Phelps, the group personnel manager, says, "For years, loading circuit boards was like building the pyramids. You needed armies of human labor. All the components were hand-inserted. Today you can design a circuit board by computer, and the same computer program will load the machine that produces the board, put the components into the right sequence, and produce most of the board."<P>
At the end of the long shop floor is the sequencing machine--about fifteen feet long and five feet high. In bins above the machine are supplies of dozens of different components. Following a computer tape, the machine loads the components in proper sequence onto what look like ammunition belts for a Gatling gun. The belts then feed the circuit-board-inserting machine, and out come nearly finished circuit boards, with capacitors, resistors, and diodes all in place. Only a few parts remain to be inserted by hand. One worker tends the sequencing machine. She was trained for the job in a few days. A second semi-skilled worker tends the inserter.<P>
Automation is evident, and equally impressive, elsewhere in the plant. A printed circuit board begins with a layer of inert fiberglass sandwiched between two sheets of copper plate. Holes are punched into the blank board to receive the components. In the "printing" of circuits onto the board, an ink screening process is used to indicate the tracks that will eventually be etched into the board. In the past few years, machines have been introduced that plate the copper, punch the holes, and even do the screening. In every case, a few machine tenders now do the work of several production workers, and they need not be highly skilled technicians. Workers were trained to use the automatic screening machine in a single day; there was no upgrading of status, job description, or pay.<P>
According to James Phelps, "We've peaked in terms of our need for the classical technician. The machinery is more and more self-diagnosing. There's less of a judgment factor. The computer spits out an instruction to change such-and-such a component, and you do it. We can upgrade a $5-an
hour assembler to a $6- or $7-an-hour junior technician with little advanced training. A few years ago, we were recruiting skilled technicians as aggressively as we're recruiting engineers today. We're not doing it now. Organizations that train technicians should realize that they're preparing people for a smaller and smaller marketplace."<P>
<BR>

A few miles away from Hewlett-Packard, the Gen-Rad Corporation makes electronic testing instruments, which are used in quality-control operations throughout the electronics industry. According to Richard Cambria, Gen-Rad's vice president for personnel, the instruments are having the same effect on Gen-Rad's production force that they are having on Gen-Rad's customers. There is a reduced need for the traditional job of "test technician," because most testing has become integral to production. Cambria says, "It used to be that the assemblers would assemble, and the inspectors would occasionally throw the work back at them. With the quality control built right into the manufacturing process, we've been able to get rid of an entire layer of inspectors,"<P>
In principle, the proliferation of computers will require skilled repair people to maintain them. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects about 130,000 new repair jobs for all types of office machinery over the course of this decade. But according to Michael Odom, a human-resources executive with Digital Equipment Corporation, the nation's second-largest computer maker, computer repair is likely to be a field of short-lived growth. Many of the new minicomputers on the market are self-diagnosing. If a circuit malfunctions, the screen will literally tell the user which panel to pull out. The circuit boards slide out like trays in a baker's rack. Digital gives its customers a supply of yellow mailing envelopes, with instructions to send the defective board back to the company for a replacement.<P>
"Things that break are usually things that move," Odom says. "The circuit board is being condensed into a chip. You don't repair a chip. The old personal computers had 100 chips; the new ones have nine. Pretty soon, computers will have no moving parts other than an on-off button. When the whole operation is on a few chips, the greatest likelihood of malfunction is probably random failure cause when a circuit is struck by an extraterrestrial gamma ray. <P>
"When the systems were more complex, we needed more sophisticated technicians to maintain them," Odom adds. "As the computer becomes a mass-market commodity--like a stereo--sales, distribution, and repair are all becoming routinized and simplified."<P>
Odom believes passionately in educating people to work with computers. He is currently on loan from Digital to the Boston city school system to help develop a computer curriculum. But he scoffs at those who expect high technology to fill the gaps in the middle of the labor market. "It's just wrong to hold out hope for high-tech as a mass provider of jobs," he says. "Increasingly, it's an elite industry of professionals. The job growth is in the industries that use our technology, and I worry about what kind of jobs those will be and who will get them."<P>
Within manufacturing generally, automation will affect the middle of the labor market in ways that are not always easy to predict. One important innovation just beginning to be applied is "computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing," or CAD/CAM. Using a computer to make and modify designs, based on an engineer's specifications, increases the productivity of a draftsman many times. The same computer that produces the blueprint can instruct the machinery to build the part. A number of junior colleges have introduced CAD/CAM programs to retrain and upgrade a whole generation of draftsmen. But, according to Lon Bonczek, a corporate vice president of Computervision, a leading CAD/CAM manufacturer, just over the horizon is something called CIM, or "computer-integrated manufacturing." The job of CAD/CAM technician, which is regarded as a hot new opportunity, will diminish, because the engineer himself will sit at the computer terminal and transform his specifications directly into a product.<P>
The economy, of course, will still require technicians to perform traditional jobs. During the 1980s, about 200,000 more auto mechanics will be needed. But contrary to expectations of a smaller but more highly skilled blue-collar work force serving high technology, there is little evidence on the shop floors or in federal statistics of a boom in demand for skilled technicians. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by 1990 about 1.5 million new technical jobs will be created, accounting for 8 percent of the total job growth. But these "new technical jobs" include dental hygienists and surveyors as well as electronics technicians.<P>
<BR>

If the changing shape of the nation's economy indeed signals a change for the worse in the distribution of jobs, there has been surprisingly little fruitful discussion of what is to be done. Public-policy debate focuses primarily on the gross unemployment rate, and on the need for government to create jobs or to subsidize job training. The quality of work, aside from industrial health-and-safety hazards, and the distribution of job opportunities are not visible public issues.<P>
Some economists believe that demographic shifts are responsible for the polarization of the work force, and that demographic shifts will eventually restore equilibrium. In this view, the explanation for both the depression of average wages and the widening gap between high and low wages is the disproportionate number of young people and of women who entered the work force during the 1970s. Young workers characteristically earn less than older ones, because of their inexperience, and women earn less than men, because of discrimination, and because of the poor salary histories that past discrimination has engendered. So it is often argued that as the work force ages and discrimination recedes, wages will fall closer to the center. Also, some economists say that as the baby-boom generation is absorbed into the work force, labor supply and demand will again balance out and employers will have to pay more to attract workers.<P>
The trouble with this theory is that it fails to acknowledge the changing range of occupations, as well as the opportunity to rise within them. The demand for workers is increasingly skewed to the extremes as a result of technology--a pressure independent of supply. And as the youthful work force ages and more women seek to rise from clerical status, the competition will become even more intense for the scarce good jobs. Demographic shifts are likely to aggravate the competition for at least a generation. In 1975, about 16.7 million workers were between thirty-five and forty-five years old--the prime earning period. In 1995, almost 34 million people will fall into this age group. Twice as many middle-aged people will be competing in 1995 for the limited supply of bread winning jobs. A recent study by the economists Martin Dooley and Peter Gottschalk, who teach at McMaster University and Bowdoin College, respectively, considered whether or not demographics alone could account for the inequality in wages during the 1970s. Even after correcting for the age, sex, size, and education of the work force, Dooley and Gottschalk found that wages remained unaccountably skewed.<P>
Others argue that as the productivity of the economy continues to rise, wages must logically rise as well. Isabel Sawhill, the former director of the National Commission for Employment Policy, says, "In the long run, the cure for low wages is increasing productivity."<P>
This cure does not treat the distributional malady, however. It is entirely possible for the economy as a whole to grow more productive while wages and occupations continue to concentrate at the extremes. At the Gen-Rad Corporation, company revenues per worker rose from $59,000 in 1981 to $72,000 in 1982 to an estimated $83,000 in 1983. Nevertheless, the wages of assembly workers have not grown nearly that fast, and the company is having no trouble filling those jobs.<P>
The fragmentation of the economy into dissimilar realms has been debated for years by economists. John Stuart Mill, in his work Principles of Political Economy, published in 1848, noted the fact that a common laborer could not reasonably aspire to be an artisan, and analyzed the barriers to free competition among workers for available jobs. Several generations of American students of trade unionism, beginning with the institutional economist John R. Commons in the 1920s, have pursued this line of inquiry. In the early 1970s, the labor economists Peter Doeringer and Michael Piore began to write about dual labor markets. The "primary" labor market, they found, is typically union-organized or professional, with relatively good wages and benefits, fairly predictable careers, and job security. The "secondary" labor market, in contrast, is made up of less desirable, low-wage jobs. Its defining characteristic is instability, with high turnover and a large proportion of part-time or seasonal work. Piore, Doeringer, and other labor-market theorists also point out the predominance of white males in "primary" jobs, and argue that the dual system both reflects and reinforces discrimination. A surprisingly large number of primary jobs, they note, do not have high formal entry requirements; skills are learned instead on the job. Through informal referral networks, white men are steered into the better jobs while blacks and women end up with the inferior ones.<P>
Economists of the rival "human-capital" school have responded to dual
labor-market theorists by arguing that if such a schism exists at all, it reflects mainly differences of skill and education. They say that undoubtedly some racial and sexual discrimination persists, and is to be deplored, but if workers are only marginally literate, with little training and sloppy work habits, it is hardly surprising that they should find only marginal jobs. Indeed, they say, it is fortunate that society provides jobs for such workers at all. According to the human-capital theorists, the obvious way to upgrade jobs is to upgrade the qualifications of the work force. This approach has informed most federal job-training efforts, including the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962, CETA, and, more recently, President Reagan's retraining initiative.<P>
A favorite counter-example by the dual-labor school is the mobilization of factories during World War II. All kinds of people who had never seen the inside of a plant learned a variety of skills on the job. But jobs were available then. If a demand for workers today is increasingly shifting toward professional jobs at one extreme, and low-wage, routine jobs at the other, it is no solution to upgrade the qualifications of workers. Although nobody should oppose the movement of basic education for its own sake, education will have little impact on the kinds of jobs available.<P>
Ronald Kutscher, of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, reports that true shortages of qualified workers exist only in a few engineering specialties and in the highest-skilled blue-collar occupations, such as journeyman tool-and-die maker. Since the real problem is the supply of good jobs rather than the supply of good workers, an emphasis on education and training will make the work force even more frustrated than it is now. According to Isabel Sawhill, during the 1970s one college graduate in five was forced to take a job that did not require a college degree.<P>
<BR>

If retraining and better basic education are not by themselves solutions to the polarization of the supply of jobs, society is not entirely without remedies. It can intervene in several ways to influence the mix of jobs, to maximize career possibilities within the workplace, and, if nothing else, to assure that routine jobs at least pay decently. Most such measures, however, are either unpopular or relatively untested.<P>
The simplest way to promote relatively equal wage scales is to encourage trade unionism. According to James Medoff, a professor of economics at Harvard who specials in labor markets, unionism by itself tends to increase wages by between 10 and 20 percent. In retail trade, for example, workers in unionized stores earn an average of $179 a week, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Non-union retail workers earn only $111 a week. Unionism is a force for wage equality for several distinct reasons. First, unions understandably seek to organize workers from the bottom up, both for reasons of solidarity and to assure that workers whose wages are low do not underbid on members. Second, unions tend to negotiate standard wage rates across firms and regions. Unions are also the principal lobby for a minimum wage, which tends to improve the distribution of wages generally. It is interesting to note that the minimum wage, which was once 54 percent of the average wage, has fallen to a record low of 39 percent--another reflection of widening inequality, and of the declining power of unions.<P>
When unions represent most workers, they undoubtedly improve the overall distribution of wages. When they represent only about one worker in five--as in the United States today, where union membership is at a forty-seven-year low--they tend to reinforce the trend toward a dual labor market, because their members enjoy a degree of market power to bargain for cost-of-living and productivity adjustments that other workers lack. In countries with strong unions the labor movement acts as a prime force for what is sometimes called a solidarity wage policy--the deliberate narrowing of the range in wage and salary income. In Sweden, where both the trade-union federation and the Social Democratic Party have recognized the limits of taxation and income transfer as instruments of redistribution, wage equalization is seen as a more efficient version of the welfare state. If wages are more nearly equal to begin with, there is less need for social programs and high taxes.<P>
Unions can be a force for egalitarian labor markets insofar as they are the principal constituency for clear career ladders, apprenticeship programs, and on-the-job retraining. Although some unions, notably those for the building trades, have acted to restrict opportunities for apprenticeship, others have sought to expand them. In the tool-and-die industry, for example, where it takes as long as four years to train a skilled journeyman, many small shops are reluctant to invest that much effort in a worker who is free to leave for a better-paid job. The International Association of Machinists has long lobbied--unsuccessfully--for publicly subsidized apprenticeship training. The United Auto Workers recently bargained for a joint program with Ford, which allows both active and laid-off workers to train for new jobs, partly at company expense. In health care, which is fragmenting into a number of paraprofessional specialties, the Service Employees International Union has fought a rearguard action to allow orderlies and practical nurses to train on the job for better positions, rather than letting hospitals recruit all their technicians from technical schools and their registered nurses from four
year colleges.<P>
Unions can also influence the way technology is applied. Officials of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) report that the new optical scanners are popular among unionized check-out clerks. A clerk has more time to chat with customers, while the scanner rings up the groceries. The scanners obviously help management improve inventory control. In bargaining over the introduction of the new technology, however, the union made sure that it would not be used to tie wages or promotions to output. This contrasts sharply with the policy of Massachusetts Blue Cross Blue Shield, whose claims examiners are not represented by a union and whose automated equipment accomplishes precisely what the UFCW sought to avoid.<P>
Although American unions are in decline, and therefore lack a pervasive influence on how management makes use of technology, management's own interests are sometimes served by the upgrading of jobs as a result of technology. While many Marxist economists, notably the late Harry Braverman, have contended that the "de-skilling" of the labor force is an inevitable consequence of advanced capitalism, the contrast between the status of the Blue Cross Blue Shield claims clerks and that of First National Bank's letter-of-credit clerks suggests that management has some latitude in the way it applies technology to the tasks at hand. William Spring, a White House adviser to President Jimmy Carter on employment policy, believes that few managers pay close attention to internal labor markets. While most corporations are nominally committed to a policy of promotion from within, maintaining a broad middle sector of the work force is rarely a corporate goal for its own sake. And the wish to cut short-run costs seems to encourage just the sort of de-skilling that the Marxists denounce.<P>

The other unfashionable remedy for the polarization of work is the public sector itself. Tom Wolfe, in his essay "Mau-Mauing the Flak-Catchers," which described an anti-poverty office in San Francisco, noted a truth about public-service agencies that poor people themselves had perceived immediately. The real value of the war on poverty lay not in the programs offered by the poverty agencies but in the opportunity of holding jobs in the poverty agencies. The public sector has been the main avenue of upward mobility for blacks and women. In 1970, according to the economist Martin Carnoy, of Stanford University, 57 percent of all black male college graduates, 79 percent of all black female college graduates, and 62 percent of all white female college graduates held public-sector jobs.<P>
As more and more of society's material goods are produced by fewer and fewer workers, the kind of society that results is ultimately a political choice. We can permit the owners of wealth to spend most of their earnings privately--and the service jobs will include salesclerks, waiters, and open-heart surgeons--or we can tax away some of those earnings and let the service jobs include more teachers and social workers. The choice exists within a realm of public policy that is the least charted of all: the means for redistributing the fruits of productivity and automation.<P>
Harry Bridges, who was the president of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union from 1937 to 1977, was among the first labor leaders to bargain explicitly with management on the consequences of automation. Beginning in 1960, as the West Coast docks were automated, Bridges negotiated the following arrangement: The shipping companies would be free to automate, but his members would not be laid off. The wages of longshoremen holding "A" union cards would rise with productivity, and the number of longshoremen would gradually be reduced by attrition. Bridges liked to say, "At this rate, by the year 2000 there will be one longshoreman left on the docks. But he's going to be the best
paid son of a bitch in the United States." As Bridges recognized, the deal was fine for union members holding "A" cards, but not so good for the work force as a whole. To generalize from Bridges's quip to an only slightly more absurd extreme, what would happen if all physical goods were produced by robots? The one worker who flipped the switch would boast astronomically high productivity. What should he be paid? And what would everyone else do for a living?<P>
Twenty years ago, many futurists predicted that society would soon become so productive that the main problem would be what to do with leisure time. It hasn't quite worked out that way. The productivity of manufacturing is rising, but since 1973, average household income, adjusted for inflation, has declined about 11 percent, and average wages have dropped 16 percent. In more than 50 percent of families with children, both parents work. Almost half of all mothers of children under six years of age work. Far from the ideal of part-time jobs, shared child
rearing, and increased leisure, most parents in two-income families are instead working full-time, juggling babysitters, and wondering why they have no time even to watch television.<P>
Among the various possible remedies, the Luddite answer is surely the wrong one. It makes no sense to preserve manual jobs doing hot, dirty work, when machines would liberate workers to do something else. But, still, the question is what? Other countries, notably in Western Europe, have made an effort to redistribute productivity by lowering the retirement age, shortening the work week, increasing vacation time, and promoting part-time work. Although none of these experiments has yet had impressive results--the European economy continues to generate more products with fewer workers, and to create more low- than high-wage jobs--the obstacles to a radical redistribution of technology's benefits seem to be as much political as they are economic.<P>
The industrial West as a whole is coming under heavy pressure, both from technology and from trade, to lower its wages. If machines are available to replace most human production jobs, and if unemployed women in the Orient are eager to take the remaining jobs producing for Western markets at ninety cents an hour, then the postwar social contract that developed in Western Europe and North America is in severe jeopardy. That social contract included high wages, job security, and a costly welfare state. It enabled the West to defy Karl Marx's prediction that under capitalism the labor force could only become worse off. Now, paradoxically, one hears that in order to maintain our standard of living we must first lower it: to remain competitive, the West must jettison the very social baggage that has assured a comfortable passage. This conclusion somehow defies common sense. From the viewpoint of the entrepreneur, wages are an unfortunate cost of production. From the perspective of the entire economy, however, they are the stuff of social stability.<P>
A distinguished company of essentially conservative political economists--Charles E. Lindblom, Karl Polanyi, Joseph Schumpeter, and even Adam Smith--have recognized what Lindblom was eventually to call "the limited competence of markets." Free markets are superb at energizing human creativity and innovation. They incur painful costs of transition, however, which are often imposed unfairly. Through no fault of their own, textile workers in North Carolina bear the costs of a new technology invented in Tokyo. The market is a marvelous engine of growth, but it is not very good at providing a socially defensible distribution of income. Over the course of this century, governments big and small have intervened to smooth out business cycles and distribute income more equitably; in this country, the devices have included minimum-wage laws, legal recognition of trade unions, Social Security, and a progressive income tax, among others. Perhaps we should add to the list of things that the market does imperfectly the distribution of work opportunity, and find ways to intervene here, as well.<P>
Wassily Leontief, the Nobel laureate in economics, argues that the loss of purchasing power from the decline in wages brought about by automation could doom the economy to a paradoxical state of rising productivity and rising destitution. Leontief proposes an ever-shorter work week, in order to assure a fair distribution of jobs and leisure, and a greater reliance on government transfer payments to distribute income and maintain consumer purchasing power. Although millions of workers are unemployed, millions more are working longer at their jobs than they might wish: the two obvious categories are people near retirement age and working parents. Following Leontief's approach, the government might supplement the pay of workers who voluntarily cut back to a three-day work week at the age of sixty. It could also supplement the income of working parents so that they could work half-time for, say, five years at a full-time rate of pay. Millions of new jobs would thereby be opened up, and at the same time, those who chose to work fewer hours for a while would suffer no loss of purchasing power. This system would be expensive in tax dollars over the short run, but as the unemployment rate dropped, it would also generate economic growth, and hence more tax revenue. Unions could then welcome automation without fear that society as a whole would benefit at the expense of the livelihood of production workers.<P>
Automation may be the ultimate solution to the inroads of foreign 
competition on American markets, and to the loss of American plants
 to poorer countries. As more efficient machines replace human workers,
  smarter capital equipment matters more than cheaper labor. But for 
  automation truly to serve as a remedy of this country's economic ailments, 
  society must become far more explicit about how the benefits of automation
   are distributed. Leontief's idea--automation combined with
    redistribution--would require an even greater role for trade unions
     and for the state than they now play. Although the government as 
     the redistributor of income and trade unions as the defenders of
      wages have been declared all but extinct lately, they may be the
       best instruments we have to resolve an explosive dilemma. The 
       debate about the distribution of wages and the content of work 
       has scarcely started, but it is certain to become more urgent.

Casey on June 29. That was a littlesurprising, considering that a majority on the Court had just voted to upholdRoe v. Wade, the 1973 decision giving constitutional status to abortion rights.The same day, Bill Clinton called a press conference to assert that "theconstitutional right to choose is hanging by a thread."<p><p><p>Both sides in the abortion controversy rushed to declare defeat. KateMichelman, the president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said,"George Bush's Court has left Roe v. Wade an empty shell." Abortion-rightsleaders called the Court's formal endorsement of Roe meaningless. The Courtaccepted restrictions on abortion rights which it had struck down asunconstitutional in 1983 and 1986, such as a twenty-four-hour waiting periodand an informed-consent requirement.<p><p><p>That did not mollify anti-abortion leaders, however. One of them, RandallTerry, complained that "three Reagan-Bush appointees stabbed the pro-lifemovement in the back." He was referring to Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,Anthony M. Kennedy, and David H. Souter, who voted to reaffirm Roe. Two otherReagan-Bush appointees, Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, arguedthat the Court should have overturned Roe.<p><p><p>What we have here is a muddle. As long as the issue remains muddled, it willnot have much impact on the presidential election. Which is exactly what theRepublicans want.<p><p><p>That is not what pro-choice and prolife leaders want. For them, the 1992campaign is a battle for saliency. They want to heighten their supporters'concern so that the abortion issue will determine a substantial number ofvotes. Their constituencies have to feel threatened--which is why both sidesclaimed defeat in the Pennsylvania case.<p><p><p>The problem is that most Americans have a muddled view of abortion: they aregenerally pro-choice, but willing to accept the kinds of restrictions imposedby the Pennsylvania law. That is more or less the Supreme Court's position. ThePennsylvania decision was an invitation to voters not to think about abortion,which is exactly what most voters want to do. The battle for saliency meansforcing people to think about it, and to vote the issue; it means turning the1992 election into a referendum on abortion. That has never yet happened to apresidential election.<p><p><p>A lot of Democrats want it to happen this year. As much as the Republicans areplaying down the abortion issue, the Democrats are playing it up: they knowthere are more potential pro-choice voters than pro-life voters. But thecampaign has to activate the pro-choice vote. That's why the Democratsshowcased their pro-choice platform at the convention in July. They invitedKate Michelman to join the nominees on the podium. "This is one of the thingsthe presidential election is about," Clinton has said.<p><p><p>Republicans don't want the election to be about abortion, and the polls showwhy. In May of this year, according to a Times Mirror survey, the Americanpublic opposed "changing the laws to make it more difficult for a woman to getan abortion" by two to one. People believed that Bill Clinton was opposed to itas well. By a nearly two-to-one majority, however, they knew that George Bushfavored restricting abortion. Bush's position is out of line with publicopinion, and the voters know it.<p><p><p>But they have known it for some time. In fact, they knew it about RonaldReagan, too. What has saved the Republicans from disaster for twelve years isone simple fact: abortion has not been a salient issue to most voters. InJanuary, when the Gallup Poll asked voters to rate the importance of sixteenissues, abortion ended up at the bottom of the list, tied for last place withforeign affairs. As long as voters felt that way, Republicans could expect thesame thing to happen this year that happened in 1984 and 1988. Only a smallnumber of votes would be determined by the abortion issue, and those would bemostly on the antiabortion side. In the two most recent presidential elections,according to the exit polls, voters who said that abortion was a major issuevoted disproportionately for Reagan and Bush. The majority of people voting inthose elections may have been pro-choice, but abortion didn't determine theirvotes. Abortion-rights advocates want pro-choice voters to feel threatened in1992--threatened enough to vote pro-choice.<p><p><p>The sense of threat was very powerful in 1989, after the decision in Webster v.Reproductive Health Services. Pro-choice voters got angry--and they gotorganized. They were a powerful force at the polls in November of that year.Pro-choice votes were critical in electing a Democratic governor of New Jersey,the first black mayor of New York, and, in Virginia, the first elected blackgovernor in the nation's history.<p><p><p>By 1990, however, the threat to abortion rights no longer seemed imminent. Fewstates had moved to criminalize abortions. (To date, only two states, Utah andLouisiana, and one territory, Guam, have done so.) The pro-choice impact at thepolls seemed to diminish with the threat.<p><p><p>Abortion-rights leaders want 1999 to be another 1989, not another 1988, and forthat to happen, pro-choice voters have to feel threatened again. ThePennsylvania case, like the Webster case, has to make them angry. But how doyou demonstrate to voters that a right just reaffirmed by the Supreme Court is"hanging by a thread"?<p><p><p>You have to remind them that four justices said they were ready to overturnRoe. One more vote and Roe is history. Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the author ofthe 1973 Roe decision, warned of just that possibility when he wrote, "I fearfor the darkness as four Justices anxiously await the single vote necessary toextinguish the light." They may not have to wait long: as Justice Blackmunreminded the country, "I am 83 years old. I cannot remain on this Courtforever." And yet the justices appointed by Reagan and Bush voted 3-2 to upholdRoe. If Bush is re-elected, will his next Court appointee be another Souter oranother Thomas?<p><p><p>The critical electoral consideration is not how many voters are on each sidebut how many voters on each side care deeply about the issue. Anti-abortionvoters have been dissatisfied with the status quo since 1973--and they havevoted the issue. Politicians knew it was risky to come out in favor of abortionrights, even if most of their constituents were pro-choice. They knew theywould lose more votes from the anti-abortion minority, most of whom would voteagainst them simply because of their position on abortion, than they would gainfrom the pro-choice majority, few of whom would vote for them simply because oftheir position on abortion.<p><p><p>The same rule applies to other divisive issues--gun control, for example. Let'ssay you take a poll and show a politician that his constituents divide 75-25percent in favor of gun control. The politician knows what will happen if hevotes to support a gun-control law: maybe five percent of the 75 percentmajority care enough about the issue to vote for him for that reason alone, buthe may lose 20 out of the 25 percent on the other side.<p><p><p>Politicians respond to intensity, not to poll numbers. They want to know whatissues matter to the voters, not just how many people are on each side. Onepro-choice activist put it this way: "Why are gun owners so politicallypowerful? There are more uterus owners than gun owners. When uterus ownersbegin to vote this issue, we will win."<p><p><p>To turn the Pennsylvania decision into a voting issue, abortion-rights leaderswill have to provide more "spin," which is what they are trying to do. Theyhave sponsored television commercials that dramatize the threat to abortionrights. They are pressuring Congress to pass the Freedom of Choice Act, whichwould put abortion rights on a statutory basis, and would likely be vetoed byBush, creating the issue they want.<p><p><p>Abortion-rights leaders can also argue that Roe is already dead. They believeRoe died with the Webster decision, in 1989, when the Supreme Court indicated awillingness to change the standard according to which it scrutinized abortionlegislation. In the Pennsylvania case the restrictions that six years ago hadbeen held incompatible with Roe were judged acceptable. That is why pro-choiceleaders call Roe an empty shell.<p><p><p>Chief Justice William Rehnquist calls it that too. Speaking for the fouranti-Roe justices, Rehnquist said the Court "retains the outer shell of Roe v.Wade, but beats a wholesale retreat from the substance of that case." He wrotethat the Pennsylvania decision leaves Roe standing "as a sort of judicialPotemkin Village, which may be pointed out to passers by as a monument to theimportance of adhering to precedent."<p><p><p>Nevertheless, it will be difficult to persuade voters that Roe is dead whenfive justices voted to reaffirm it, and especially difficult because mostvoters do not disagree with the Court' s ruling in the Pennsylvania case. Pollsshowed majorities of 70 percent or more endorsing the restrictions upheld bythe Court.<p><p><p><p><p>Opinions on abortion have remained fairly stable for the past twenty years.Almost every year since 1972 the National Opinion Research Center of theUniversity of Chicago has been asking people whether it should be possible fora pregnant woman to have a legal abortion under various circumstances. Largemajorities have consistently supported legal abortion if the woman's health isseriously endangered, if she has been raped, or if there is a strong chancethat the baby will have a serious birth defect.<p><p><p>In most years the public has been opposed to legal abortion if the family ispoor or doesn't want any more children, if the woman doesn't want to getmarried, or if the woman wants the abortion "for any reason." Those are alldiscretionary circumstances: what people have been saying in these polls isthat they do not approve of abortion as a form of birth control.<p><p><p>That may explain why Americans have been uneasy about the status quo underRoe--they feel that far too many of the 1.5 million legal abortions performedin this country every year are being done for the purpose of birth control. Thepublic clearly has moral qualms about abortion, believing that it should beallowed only when there is a more compelling moral argument on the other side.To most people, a threat to the life or health of the mother, rape, or aserious deformity in the child are more compelling moral arguments. Birthcontrol is not.<p><p><p>The debate over abortion seems to have no middle ground--except in publicopinion. In a Gallup poll taken after the Pennsylvania ruling, one third of thepeople responding thought abortion should be legal "under any circumstances."That figure is up from one quarter before the Webster decision, in 1989.Thirteen percent said abortion should be "illegal in all circumstances"--downfrom 18 percent before Webster. Support for abortion rights has edged upwardover the past three years. But almost half the public (48 percent) continues tosay that abortion should be legal only "under certain circumstances."<p><p><p>Politicians have one thing in common with voters: they don't want to thinkabout the abortion issue. They want to demobilize the debate and get the issueoff the agenda. That is especially true for Republicans. President Bush hassaid, "We have room in our party for people that feel...pro-life or pro-choice.The Democratic Party is the same way." Even though Democrats intend to run onthe issue this year, they don't want to get too far from the muddle of publicopinion. Bill Clinton told the delegates at Madison Square Garden, "I am notpro-abortion. I am pro-choice." Politicians are doing the same thing theSupreme Court is doing on this issue. They are muddling through.<p></blockquote><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><br><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1992 by William Schneider.

<blockquote>

	

<font size=5>B</font>Y the benighted standards of East Africa the spectacle 

in this crowded, squalid refugee camp is all too grimly familiar: tents and 

shacks, children in rags, adults hanging their heads in endless solemn 

discussion.  The talk is of ethnic cleansing, private militias, the 

prospect of war.  "We don't want any revenge," one of them is saying.  "We 

are not harboring any hatred.  But as a human being, if you are pushed to 

the wall, you can be provoked." The scene could be anywhere in a vast arc 

of despair that has blighted this part of the world for a generation: 

Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi.  But it takes place 

in none of those exhausted battlegrounds.  This is <A 

HREF="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/African_Studies/Country_Specific/Kenya.html">Kenya</A>. 

 <p>



East Africa's richest country by far, familiar to safari lovers and <A 

HREF="http://www.dis.dk/dis/kultur/karenb/baggrund.e.html">Isak Dinesen</A> 

readers, Kenya is supposed to be an exception to the regional rule of 

interminable wars and economic ruin.  Its game parks lure nearly a million 

tourists each year.  Telephones work, electricity flows, children go to 

school in shorts and knee socks.  Kenya has long been a haven for other 

countries' refugees.  The sight of Kenyan refugees is cause for alarm.  <p>



It is a brilliant Saturday morning in the lush green hills of 

the Rift Valley, Kenya's most fertile farming region.  In the days of 

British colonial rule these hills were called the White Highlands, and 

formed a gorgeous and exotic backdrop for the khaki-clad protagonists of 

Dinesen, Elspeth Huxley, and Beryl Markham.  But the story unfolding today 

is of a different kind.  <p> 



"Twelve members of my family were displaced," a man I'll call James tells 

me.  He is forty-four years old, a bewildered-looking man with tired eyes 

and a beard of white stubble.  The interview is conducted furtively in a 

shack--a friend minds the door, wary of informers.  This is an officially 

declared "security zone," barred to journalists.  <p>



James says that a band of perhaps 200 arsonists attacked his farm, wielding 

bows and arrows.  They looted and torched his house, and drove its panicked 

occupants into the bush.  "We don't return home because we fear we will be 

beaten again," he explains.  "The attackers are still there." He adds, 

"They were organized." By whom?  "We don't want to say, really." <p>



What James won't say is by now well documented: the mob that attacked his 

home was organized by agents of the Kenyan government.  James is Kikuyu--a 

member of one of Kenya's largest ethnic groups.  The attackers were 

Kalenjin--members of the small pastoral group to which Kenya's longtime 

President, Daniel arap Moi, belongs.  Since 1991 more than 1,500 Kenyans 

have been killed--mostly Kikuyus like James, but also Luos and Luhyas--and 

300,000 have been displaced in ethnic clashes, mostly with Kalenjin, that 

have shaken Kenya's precarious unity.<p>



President Moi and members of his ruling clique have sought to deflect 

responsibility for the violence by blaming age-old hatreds--stirred up, 

they claim, by the advent of multi-party democracy.  But the evidence of 

state complicity is strong, and it fits a pattern that has become striking 

in post-Cold War Africa.  Daniel arap Moi, who is seventy-one years old and 

widely loathed, presided for years over a predatory single-party regime 

that was made possible by the patronage of the West.  No longer a Cold War 

asset, and pressured to democratize, Moi has clung to power by playing 

dirty.  Skillfully manipulating the levers of coercion and bribery, he has 

sabotaged Kenya's monetary system, emasculated the rule of law, and stoked 

the destructive fires of ethnicity.<p>



Is Kenya to become yet another African nightmare?  Many fear so.  The 

miracle is that it has not already done so.  For years Kenya has been 

viewed as the proverbial powder keg.  There were epochal assassinations in 

the 1960s and 1970s.  A failed coup in 1982 exposed sharp divisions of 

group and class.  Now the clashes have inflamed those divisions.  Yet 

somehow Kenya confounds perennial predictions of an imminent inferno.  

Though tensions remain high, thousands remain homeless, and almost no one 

has been held accountable, the Rift Valley clashes appear to have subsided 

for now; the lust for revenge has been held in check.  Kenyans who look at 

their broken neighbors and ask, "Could it happen here?" now also ask, "Why 

<i>hasn't </i>it happened here?" <p>



I lived in Kenya for eight months recently, and traveled to all its 

battered neighbors in turn.  I came to appreciate why Kenya is not just 

another African horror story:it has strengths that its neighbors never had.  

The country is both tearing itself apart and struggling mightily to hold 

itself together.  Kenya is an all too typical study in the use of ethnicity 

as an instrument of tyranny.  But it may also demonstrate the limits of 

ethnicity in the face of countervailing forces.  The country is in the 

midst of a powerful emancipation drama.  The United States was once a key 

player in that drama.  No longer.  Having spurred the movement toward 

multi-party democracy, it has, as one Kenyan says, gone "under the 

carpet."<p>



<font size=5>"I</font>T is a miracle that we have come this far without 

disintegrating," says Gitobu Imanyara, a lawyer in Nairobi who has been at 

the forefront of Kenya's fitful years-long struggle to break free of 

corrupt and oppressive single-party rule.  Like many others, Imanyara has 

paid a price.  The magazine he published, the <i>Nairobi Law Monthly</i>, 

was repeatedly raided and ransacked, and harassed out of business for a 

time.  Imanyara has been detained four times, including once for two months 

in a psychiatric ward after he accused President Moi of filling government 

jobs according to ethnic affiliation rather than competence.<p>



"We have a President who is determined to fulfill his prophesy that the 

country is not cohesive enough for multi-party democracy," Imanyara says.  

"His desire is to prove he was right, even if it means destroying Kenya as 

a country." Kenya includes more than forty ethnic groups, Imanyara 

explains.  "The President has consistently pursued policies that encourage 

the various ethnic groups to think of themselves as different, not as one 

nation."<p>



Imanyara's office overlooks Moi Avenue, the bustling main thoroughfare in 

downtown Nairobi.  The Kenyan capital boasts glass office towers, luxurious 

safari hotels, art galleries, and first-class restaurants.  But beyond this 

cosmopolitan core is a teeming, crumbling Third World city.  A handful of 

Kenyan fat cats and tourists with their cameras and tony safari outfits are 

stared at with palpable envy by the impoverished hordes of 

"<i>wananchi</i>"--"the masses." Most <i>wananchi </i>live in huge, foul, 

densely packed shantytowns where glue-sniffing street kids prowl for 

garbage, and illegally distilled "<i>chang'aa</i>" is the primary source of 

income.<p>



Unemployment approaches 50 percent in Nairobi, and crime is rampant.  The 

Kenyan papers are filled with hair-raising tales of gangsterism, and of the 

crude, largely futile police war to suppress it.  While I was there, the 

Nairobi police shot dead twenty criminal suspects in just ten days.  

Meanwhile, after a gang armed with Uzis and AK-47 assault rifles robbed a 

downtown bank in broad daylight, the fourth major bank robbery in a month, 

a witness told the <i>Daily Nation</i>, "When you see seven armed policemen 

running away, then things are hot."<p> 



Kenya's politics is every bit as volatile.  During the time I was based in 

Kenya, not only were thousands of clash victims living as "internally 

displaced" refugees, but two journalists were arrested, beaten, and jailed 

for months after questioning the independence of the judiciary; a prominent 

former member of Parliament was put on trial for his life on charges widely 

condemned as fraudulent; the nation's doctors and university lecturers went 

on strike; opposition rallies were regularly banned; an opposition 

candidate died in a mysterious automobile accident; an opposition MP was 

attacked in his home with a petrol bomb; and the President's closest 

political confidant--"total man" Nicholas Biwott, a former Minister of 

Energy--remained a principal suspect in the 1990 murder of the Foreign 

Minister.  <p>



<font size=5>F</font>ROM behind every counter and every desk in every store 

and office the dour image of "His Excellency Daniel T.  arap Moi, C.G.H., 

M.P., President of the Republic of Kenya and Commander-in-Chief of the 

Armed Forces," stares impassively into the middle distance.  The portrait 

is a mandatory totem of loyalty.  President Moi, who succeeded Kenya's 

first President, Jomo Kenyatta, in 1978, personifies the rottenness of the 

Kenyan state.  Surrounded by parasites and sycophants, Moi long ago proved 

himself a shrewd master of Big Man politics: tough enough to crack heads 

when necessary, he more often adroitly manipulates the flow of cash as the 

conduit of power.  <p>



Politics in Kenya has always been a means of securing "access to the 

meat." Rampant corruption has sapped the economy and widened the gap between 

a rapacious few and the sullen <i>wananchi</i>.  Companies with links to 

Moi have skimmed monumental sums off government contracts in wheat, oil, 

and land, and particularly off foreign aid.  Budget allocations are sold to 

the highest bidder.  One series of scams in the early 1990s cost Kenya the 

equivalent of 10 percent of its annual gross domestic product.  <p> 



In the 1992 election campaign Moi's cronies established a network of 

"political banks" that siphoned money out of the Central Bank and pumped it 

into the ruling party's campaign.  This brazen abuse of the monetary system 

to finance the bribes and blandishments of an election campaign almost 

doubled the money supply in six months, creating 100 percent inflation.  

<p>



The idea of the state as a cash cow did not originate with Moi.  The 

British milked Kenya for the benefit of their empire and a handful of white 

settlers.  The British also perfected in Kenya the administrative apparatus 

of "indirect rule," whereby a network of appointed tribal chiefs exercised 

unaccountable power on behalf of an unelected sovereign.  The system 

survived independence in 1963 and remains the basis for virtually unlimited 

executive power at the local level to declare emergencies, arrest and 

punish, and issue licenses.  Elected members of Parliament cannot even 

address their constituents without the permission of chiefs who are 

accountable only to the President.<P>



Jomo Kenyatta and members of his family amassed a huge fortune in land, 

precious stones, ivory, and casinos during his fifteen-year rule after 

independence.  Kenyatta's crimes were small compared with the systematic 

looting of Moi's gang, but they sowed the seeds of the current malaise.  

Kenyatta also established the Kenyan tradition of ethnic chauvinism, 

bestowing the fruits of power primarily on his own people, the Kikuyu, who 

enjoyed privileged access to land, jobs, and education.  <p> 



To no one's surprise, the Kikuyu emerged as leading opponents of Moi's 

regime, and they predominate in the movement toward multi-party democracy.  

Moi and his ruling party were returned to power in 1992 with barely a third 

of the total vote, their victory owing largely to ethnic and personal 

divisions among the opposition parties.  There was also substantial 

evidence of fraud and intimidation, not least in the Rift Valley, where 

elaborate gerrymandering left a hugely disproportionate number of 

parliamentary seats in a province from which nearly all non-Kalenjins had 

been violently expelled.  <p> 



<font size=5>T</font>HE clashes have roots in genuine competition over 

land--always a sensitive issue in a largely rural country with one of the 

highest population-growth rates in the world.  The Rift Valley was 

traditionally the home of pastoral groups, including the Kalenjin and the 

Masai.  During the colonial period white settlers expropriated this fertile 

land.  They staked out vast farms and recruited native cultivators, notably 

Kikuyus, Luos, and Luhyas, to work their fields.  After independence, in 

1963, British settlers began to sell off their lands.  President Kenyatta 

ensured that his own people, the Kikuyu, were the primary beneficiaries.<p> 



So there has long been a reservoir of resentment and mistrust of the 

Kikuyu.  The challenge for a beleaguered despot like Moi is to exploit that 

resentment--stoke it, harness it, even arm it, in order to destabilize 

opponents and discredit multi-partyism.  <p> 



Moi and his associates have repeatedly portrayed calls for political 

pluralism as anti-Kalenjin.  Officials refer to the Kikuyu as "aliens" and 

"foreigners," and to the Kalenjin and other pastoral groups as "natives" 

and "original inhabitants." At rallies and on the state radio they warn 

that the opposition is arming itself to eliminate indigenous residents from 

the Rift Valley.  <p> 



Moi's government sought to bolster these accusations at a 

nineteen-month-long show trial in which a former MP, <A 

HREF="http://www.spidergraphics.com/khr/khrld.html">Koigi wa Wamwere</A>, a 

militant Kikuyu, was convicted of raiding a police station to acquire arms.  

The state's case was repeatedly discredited in court, and trial observers 

unanimously decried what <A 

HREF="http://www.traveller.com/~hrweb/ai/ai.html">Amnesty International</A> 

called the "abusive use of the law" in Koigi's trial.  Clearly, the 

government's aim was to cultivate a fear that Kikuyus were arming 

themselves.  Koigi was sentenced to four years in prison and six lashes 

with a cane.<p>



The Rift Valley violence coincided with calls from officials in Moi's inner 

circle for "<i>majimboism</i>," a federal system based on ethnicity.  

Proponents of <i>majimboism</i> have urged the routing of all other ethnic 

groups from lands occupied before the colonial era by the Kalenjin and 

other pastoral groups.  They use the term "<i>madoadoa</i>"--"black spots," 

a chilling echo of South African terminology in the era of forced 

removals--to refer to land occupied by non-Kalenjins.  Many Kenyans regard 

<i>majimboism</i> as nothing less than ethnic cleansing.  <p> 



To be sure, some opposition parties are identified with ethnic groups, and 

they, too, engage in exclusivity.  The difference is that Moi suffocates 

and divides his countrymen using the institutions of the state: the police, 

the courts, the powers of arrest and detention.  <p> 



A Luhya farmer I'll call Charles, sixty-four, whose family was driven off 

their land by a marauding gang of Kalenjin warriors, expresses little doubt 

about who is responsible for his predicament.  Huddled with a half dozen 

other embittered Luhyas in a refugee settlement near the Uganda border, 

Charles snorts "<i>Bubeyi!</i>" --"Lies!"--when I float Moi's argument that 

multi-partyism leads to tribalism.  "The Kalenjin who pierce their 

ears--these are the people who did this to us.  But it's their leaders who 

began this violence.  If it were just a question of tribes fighting each 

other, then the government would have intervened."<p> 



The Kenyan government has hardly intervened.  For the most part it has 

turned a blind eye on the attackers and has shown outright hostility toward 

those who have sought to investigate incidents or help the victims.  The 

government declared clash areas "security zones" and barred journalists 

from entering them.  Kenya's Attorney General, Amos Wako, told me that 

murder charges had been brought only seventeen times in connection with the 

clashes (roughly one charge for every 100 murders) and had resulted in only 

eight convictions.  "The problem is evidence," he said.  <p> 



More likely, the problem is the steady erosion of the rule of law which has 

been one of Moi's most destructive--and ominous--legacies.  Kenya has never 

been a full-fledged police state, but Moi has systematically eviscerated 

the system of law and accountability.  <p> 



<font size=5>O</font>NE of the most prominent political bruisers in Moi's 

"Rift Valley mafia" is William ole Ntimama, a flamboyant demagogue who, as 

Minister of Local Government, is the country's most outspoken advocate of 

<i>majimboism</i>.  Ntimama is renowned for his fiery speeches.  At the 

height of the clashes he warned Kikuyus that they would be "cut down to 

size like the Ibo" of Nigeria, who perished by the hundreds of thousands in 

the disastrous Biafran war.  Ntimama is widely accused of inciting members 

of his own tiny pastoral group, the Masai, who have formed an alliance with 

the Kalenjin to drive thousands of Kikuyus off their land.  <p> 



Ntimama, sixty-five, is a gregarious man with an affable laugh and a huge 

gap-toothed smile.  He greeted me warmly in his gigantic office at the 

Ministry of Local Government.  "The British have messed up our people," he 

declared.  "They have actually made us part of a zoo, part of the animal 

kingdom.  So there is a lot of bitterness."<p> 



The Masai were, in fact, marginalized by British and Kikuyu alike.  They 

are one of Africa's last truly traditional groups, the subject of countless 

Western picture books that romanticize these tall, thin, nomadic cattle 

herders in their distinctive red blankets and bead necklaces, their 

earlobes pierced and stretched and their hair caked with ocher.  Anyone who 

has been on safari in Kenya will have seen vans full of gawking tourists 

aiming their cameras at the Masai as if they were creatures from the 

wild.<p> 



"For all the marginalized people, when there is a flare or some uprising, 

or certain ethnic differences, it is very easy to write it off and say it 

is ethnic cleansing, or stirring ethnic conflict," Ntimama told me.  Fair 

enough.  But of course Ntimama is not himself among Kenya's marginalized.  

During three decades in politics he has proved to be a shrewd and ruthless 

operator.  Mostly self-educated, he was born and raised in the town of 

Narok, on the majestic savanna that runs across much of southern Kenya.  In 

1974 Ntimama became the chairman of the Narok County Council, responsible 

for managing the Masai Mara, Kenya's most famous--and lucrative--game 

reserve.  Thousands of tourists bearing huge quantities of hard currency 

visit the Mara each year to observe its breathtaking array of wildlife.  

Ntimama and his fellow council members have skimmed off the bulk of the 

Mara's gate receipts.  They have granted concessions to safari-lodge 

builders in exchange for generous kickbacks.  Ntimama has a substantial 

stake in Governor's Camp, one of the most expensive lodges in the 

reserve.<p> 



I asked Ntimama about the rule of law in the Rift Valley.  If 

the Masai have a just cause, is there no legal remedy?  "The law applied is 

a discriminatory law," he replied.  Should the Masai then just take the law 

into their own hands?  "I have never told anybody to fight," Ntimama 

protested.  Laughing, he added, "We never really cleansed anywhere other 

than Enoosupukia"--a village from which 10,000 Kikuyus were displaced.  So, 

then, they did cleanse in Enoosupukia?  Ntimama roared with laughter.  "I 

deny ethnic cleansing," he declared.  Did he have any idea what would 

happen to the refugees from Enoosupukia?  "I can't say," he replied, 

shrugging.  "Maybe the United Nations is trying to find a solution."<p> 



Later I asked Attorney General Wako why he didn't arrest Ntimama for 

incitement.  "If you arrest Ntimama, there would be riots," Wako replied.  

So much for the rule of law.<p> 



<font size=5>W</font>HY, then, has Kenya not disintegrated? What 

happened in Rwanda scared Kenya.  The fact that civil war has not already 

occurred is an indication of how dreaded the prospect of war is.  Kenyans 

are no strangers to war.  They fought the Mau Mau insurgency against the 

British in the 1950s.  More than 11,000 guerrillas were killed in that war, 

and thousands more were detained and tortured, or displaced to horrific 

concentration camps, where many died.  (The Mau Mau, for their part, killed 

only ninety-five whites, including thirty-two civilians.) Nearly all those 

involved in the Mau Mau struggle were Kikuyu, and Kikuyu elders have been 

counseling restraint.<p> 



"The memories of Mau Mau are still with us," says a man I'll call Peter, 

fifty-eight, another embittered Kikuyu who was driven from his farm by 

Kalenjin warriors.  In 1953, when Peter was sixteen, his family was 

displaced from the Equator Ranch of the settler leader Lord Delamere.  

Three of his cousins, suspected Mau Mau guerrillas, were killed by Kikuyu 

"home guards"--natives employed by the British.  "We do not favor any war 

or conflict, because they only bring misery," Peter says.  "The most 

important thing we want is peace."<p> 



Kenyans generally are much better educated and better informed than their 

neighbors.  A generation of Kenyans has grown up with the benefits of 

relative stability, which have resulted in a substantial middle class.  

Elsewhere in Africa the vertical ties of ethnicity represent both the only 

source of identity and the only channel for economic and political power.  

Kenya's middle class cuts horizontally across ethnic lines.  Urban Kenyans 

have as much in common with other urbanites as with the rural members of 

their groups.  And the Kenyans who have been most provoked by the 

clashes--the Kikuyu and the Luo --are also among the best educated. <p> 



Gibson Kamau Kuria, a Kikuyu lawyer who is the dean of <A 

HREF="http://www.spidergraphics.com/khr/khrdef.html">Kenya's human-rights 

movement</A>, and who once spent ten months in prison for his advocacy, 

puts it this way:"The Kikuyus and the Luos are most involved in the market 

economy, and they were in the forefront of the struggle for independence, 

as well as in the move toward democracy.  They understand that the problem 

is one of bad government and corrupt economics, not bad tribes.  Once you 

conceptualize the problem as dealing with bad governance, then you know the 

solution lies in good government, human rights, and sound economic 

management, not tribal warfare." <p>



Rural Kenyans tend to follow the lead of their better-educated brethren.  

Even among the Kalenjin, many recognize that their interests don't 

necessarily coincide with those of Moi's tiny clique.  "The Kalenjin are 

not a united front," says Bethwell Kipligat, a diplomat from the Nandi clan 

of the Kalenjin.  "The Nandi leadership was aggrieved by the clashes and 

helped the victims.  And they spoke out.  This is a sign of hope."<p> 



Kenya has developed a vigorous civil society that likewise cuts across 

ethnic lines.  This is an essential point.  The Catholic and Protestant 

churches, the Law Society, human-rights groups, the independent press--all 

have proved remarkably resilient despite years of harassment.  After the 

Cold War the institutions of civil society blossomed with newfound support 

from Western donor countries.  They have been prodigiously exposing, 

documenting, analyzing, protesting, mediating--and reducing the capacity of 

the state to manipulate truth.  "Before, the West had supported the 

regime," Kipligat says.  "Now the West was echoing what the civil society 

was saying.  The civil society became stronger than the regime.  There was 

no choice but for the President to change course." <p> 



Finally, President Moi is a shrewd survivor.  He seems to realize that he 

cannot simply crack heads on a huge scale without paying a price.  He 

harasses but does not crush.  "Moi makes tactical retreats when he thinks 

he is pushing people too far," explains Kiruri Kamau, the managing editor 

of the embattled independent weekly <i>The People</i>.  "Moi is very 

cunning.  He is calculating." When asked why the clashes haven't escalated, 

Kamau replies, "Moi realized these things had gone too far.  If there is a 

war, Moi would stand to lose so much."<p> 



<font size=5>D</font>URING the Cold War the United States poured billions 

of dollars into Kenya, helping to sustain Moi's patronage-based government 

and enrich his clique.  In 1990, however, the United States suspended its 

aid and played a key role in inducing Moi to lift his ten-year ban on 

opposition parties.  The U.S.  ambassador at the time was Smith Hempstone, 

a flamboyant, outspoken right-wing newspaperman who had been appointed to 

this diplomatic post, his first, by his friend George Bush.  Hempstone was 

a vociferous critic of Moi's regime.  He denounced the arrests of 

dissidents and the shutting down of newspapers, assailed election 

irregularities, and went out of his way to be seen with opposition leaders.  

Hempstone was embraced as a hero by Kenya's fledgling democracy movement.  

That a major world power shared the goals of this small circle of idealists 

altered the psychology of all the players.<p> 



Hempstone returned home in 1993 and was replaced by Aurelia Brazeal, a 

career diplomat who, in contrast, projects an image of studied ambiguity.  

"Quiet diplomacy" is the term favored by those who believe that the 

differences between Brazeal and Hempstone are more of style than of 

substance.  Kenyans call Brazeal's approach "appeasement," and they make no 

secret of their disappointment.  Brazeal, for her part, has evidently grown 

tired of being compared with her predecessor.  She granted me an 

off-the-record interview on the condition that there be no questions about 

Hempstone.  <p> 



Brazeal has been particularly elusive on the core issue of the rule of law.  

At a time when the President is deploying state power to harass and 

intimidate opposition voices almost daily, the U.S.  response has been 

notably muted.  Publicly, at least, Brazeal has espoused a "pox on all your 

houses" view.  In a speech she made while I was there, which was covered as 

the lead story in the <i>Sunday Nation</i>, she bemoaned what she called a 

"lack of understanding" between government and opposition.  "There are not 

many people seeking to build a middle ground," Brazeal said.  "Kenya's 

political atmosphere sometimes resembles the siege of a medieval European 

castle, with the government refusing the opposition entry and the 

opposition armies catapulting missiles over the walls.  What Kenya needs is 

the flag of truce, a ceasefire in this incessant conflict."<p> 



A nice metaphor, but in fact there is no organized violent resistance to 

Moi.  Opposition figures, however, have been clubbed, firebombed, jailed, 

and tortured, and nearly all have repeatedly been barred from addressing 

their constituencies.  In such an atmosphere the ambassador's evenhanded 

appeal for a "middle ground" understandably grates on Kenyan ears.  <p> 



It may just be that Ambassador Brazeal lacks political intuition.  The 

United States has pressed for economic reforms the purpose of which is to 

close off conduits for corruption.  Evidently pleased with the results, 

Western donors last January pledged $800 million in renewed assistance to 

Kenya.  They thereby sent a signal that economic reforms need not be 

matched by political reforms--and repression has escalated ever since.  <p> 



The question is not just whether Kenya will self-destruct but whether it 

will be blocked from achieving its enormous potential.  Like South Africa, 

Kenya could be an economic locomotive for its long-suffering region--and a 

much-needed symbol of success.  Its emancipation process needs support.  An 

election looms in 1997.  The West need not take sides in the struggle for 

political power, but Kenyans deserve a clear stand in favor of the 

institutions without which their country cannot hope to be genuinely 

stable: a free press, free assembly, above all the rule of law.  The United 

States has too often operated in Africa on the assumption that lawlessness 

and ethnic turmoil simply go with the territory.  But Africans themselves 

have always objected strenuously to this view.<p> 



"In Kenya we have internal refugees," says Martha Karua, a bright young 

lawyer in Nairobi and an opposition MP.  "Just because they are small 

numbers compared with Rwanda or Somalia or Sudan--if you compare us with 

those countries, of course we are better.  The international community is 

judging us as an African country.  They look around us and say, `Kenya is a 

shining light'--and that is where they are wrong." Her advice to the West: 

"Hold us up to the same standard, not an African standard." <p>

<blockquote>
	


<p>


<b>Could you fill us in on what you've done since you wrote "The Warlords of
Natal" for <i>The Atlantic </i>in March, 1994?</b><p>

<p>

I had an Alicia Patterson fellowship all last year. I spent a year reporting on
ethnic conflict in Africa. I spent a year in east and southern Africa. I made a
number of trips to Rwanda, during and after the genocide there. I reported from
Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa. I am writing a book about
ethnic conflict in Africa.<p>

<p>

<b>How did you develop your interest in Africa?</b><p>

<p>

Twelve years ago I got interested primarily in South Africa, for obvious
reasons: big story, big drama, big racial melodrama. From a logistical point of
view, I had trouble getting into South Africa. I ended up in black Africa
instead and got hooked, got addicted. You know what they say about Sudan: once
you've drunk from the waters of the White Nile, you're infected for life. I
found that what was going on in Africa was extremely compelling and
fascinating. Also, as a journalist I've tended to be at my best and most
comfortable off the beaten track. I like being in border towns. Black Africa is
sort of like powder skiing in that regard: you're the only one there, it's all
virgin territory. These are huge issues--issues of war and peace, good and
evil. There are great historical dramas unfolding with all different eras of
history taking place simultaneously. Biblical famines, feudal politics, cold
war intrigue, communism, capitalism, Stalinism, Islam--all going on at once.
I've also had a particular interest in history and Africa is the part of the
world where history is unfolding. I like telling people about stuff they don't
know anything about.<p>

<p>

<b>Have you had close calls in Africa?</b><p>

<p>

From time to time. I wouldn't want to exaggerate them though. Nothing that's
happened to me compares to what happens to Africans all the time. But there
have been some problematical episodes. I've been arrested a couple of times.
I've received death threats. Ironically and unfairly, white people have
protections in Africa that Africans themselves don't have--mainly because even
the most thuggish official or police officer can make the elementary
calculation that if something happens to a foreigner he might be held
accountable for it, whereas if something happens to a fellow African no one
will ever hear about it. But, yes, my wife and I were arrested in Zaire a
couple of years ago when I was working on a piece for <i>The Atlantic</i>. I
was arrested in Liberia once. <p>

<p>

<b>How do you get out of those situations?</b><p>

<p>

In both cases the key was getting a message to the American embassy.
Once it becomes a diplomatic issue they can make that calculation that I've
just described for you. Again it's something that a white American can benefit
from where Africans don't. There was a moment in Zaire when we were
incommunicado and things started looking bad. It was not clear how things were
going to work out. I was scared; my wife was scared too. But most of the time
if you do your homework and are with the right people, and you always move
around with guides and escorts, then there's a way of doing this that will keep
you out of trouble.<p>

<p>

<b>What do you think about the Masai people in Kenya?</b><p>

<p>

The Masai are being exploited by well-meaning foreigners and by tourists
who are fascinated by their exotic attire and lifestyle. They are being
exploited by their political leaders in Kenya, including this guy William ole
Ntimama, who is their leader and spokesman but who is milking their resources
for his own personal benefit. That's the kind of thing that goes on in an
imperfect political system, where there is very little accountability. He's
both exploiting them financially and using them as cannon fodder. If there were
a more enlightened political culture in Kenya, which is what a great many
Kenyans are working, struggling, and dying for, then the Masai would benefit
too. But for the moment they're getting the short end of the stick. If you go
on one of these tours of the Masai lands looking at wildlife, it's a very
powerful experience to check all this out. But white people from abroad come
and treat the Masai like zoo animals. To most foreigners they're another form
of wildlife.<p>

<p>

<b>What do you hope readers will get from your article?</b><p>

<p>

Two things. One, a greater appreciation that ethnic conflict flows from
the top down, that it's not this spontaneous, primitive impulse among Africans,
but rather a consequence of political calculation by tyrannical leaders.
Secondly, that not all African countries are the same. Some have strengths that
others don't have. I hope that some of the things that have prevented Kenya
from sliding down into the abyss will help to illuminate for readers why other
countries <i>have</i> slipped down into the abyss. I hope to give readers a
sense that Africa is complicated like everywhere else. There are reasons why
these things happen or don't happen. I hope also to convey a sense, which I
think is often lacking in American press coverage of Africa, that there are
articulate African voices out there. Too often they are quoted just as victims
or as objects. White people and diplomats and aid workers are quoted explaining
what's going on. I tried to include as many intelligent African voices as I
could. There are a lot of very intelligent, very wise, astute, and
well-informed Kenyans. I also hope to explain that the U.S. has a role in
Kenya. It was, until not long ago, a positive constructive role.<p>

<p>

<b>What caused the great shift in U.S. involvement in Kenya?</b><p>

<p>

Mainly the change in ambassadors. There was a guy named Smith Hempstone, who
was, ironically, a right-wing Republican buddy of George Bush but who
nevertheless was an inspired diplomat in Kenya. He's been replaced by a woman
who has not been an inspired diplomat in my judgment. I think sometimes we make
apologies for Africans and hold Africa to a lower standard, which is
patronizing and counterproductive. I think we fail to make the distinction
between good Africans and bad Africans. We tend to think that the reasons for
Africa's problems are cultural or exotic, and they're not in my opinion.
They're the same reasons that have created conflict in all parts of the world.
The solutions, in my judgment, are the same as they are in all parts of the
world: democracy, human rights, free press, free association, rule of law. I
think we should be throwing our lot in with those institutions instead of being
understanding of the cultural sensibilities of gangsters and despots. I think
that is what the ambassador hasn't realized. Ethnic conflict flows from the top
down. It's a by-product of tyranny. I think most Americans still think that
when they see Africans killing each other there's some exotic explanation for
it, that there's some primitive, inherent savagery that is impelling people to
kill each other. One would think that the tribe of Bach, Beethoven, and Goethe
had long since proven that we're all capable of doing bad things to each
other.<p>

<b><i><font size=5>O</font>f late I have been meeting up with the use of</i></b> thanks to <b><i> in 
contexts like these: "A three-stall car wash was missing one wall</i></b> 
thanks to <b><i> the rushing waters of the Delaware" and "We will continue to 
have . . . escalating crime </i></b>thanks to <b><i> children who grow up in 
combat zones." These may not be grammatical errors but they strike me as 
illogical uses of the phrase. Whatever happened to</i></b> due 
to<b><i>? </I></b> <p>


<B>J. Nina Lieberman<br>
<i>Woodstock, N.Y.</i></b>
	
<p> <!--BARBARA"S RESPONSE TEXT--> Where blame is more to the point than 
gratitude, <b>thanks to</b> is indeed out of place.  However, there 
are traditional limits on the use of <B>due to</B> that keep it from 
being an all-purpose solution to the problem.  A noun is allowed to be 
<B>due to</B> a noun ("The <B>need</B> to repair the car wash 
is <B>due to</B> the storm"), but a clause may not be <B>due 
to</B> a noun ("<B>The car wash needs repairs due to</B> the 
<B>storm</B>").  It's usually possible to revise one's sentence to 
conform to the rule.  But changing <B>due to</B>--or <B>thanks 
to</B>--to <B>owing to</B> or <B>because of</B> is almost 
always the simplest solution.<p>

Why is <B>owing to</B> allowed where <B>due to</B> is not?  
It has been in use much longer in such prepositional contexts, 
<B>due</B> having been nothing more than an ordinary adjective 
("Repairs are certainly <B>due</B>") a century ago.  Those 
precisians who fifty or thirty years ago denounced the preposition <B>due 
to</B> as an arriviste have tainted its reputation.<p>

	<b><i><font size=5>A</font>fter a waiter sets a plate of food before me at a restaurant, the 
last word to leave his mouth before he walks away is </i></b>"Enjoy!"<b><i> This 
seems to be catching on everywhere. I went to the doctor for a pulled 
tendon. Handing me a prescription and my bill, he said, 
</i></b>"Enjoy!"<b><i> 
Isn't </i></b>enjoy<b><i>, when used in the imperative, a reflexive verb 
requiring a pronoun or noun, as in</i></b> Enjoy 
yourself<b><i>?</i></b><p>

<b>Steve Saunders<br>
<i>Oxford, Conn.</i></b><p>
	
									<!--BARBARA"S RESPONSE TEXT-->
What if the waiter said "<B>Enjoy</B> your meal"? This perfectly correct 
sentence establishes that <B>enjoy</B> can be used transitively (with a 
direct object), as well as in the reflexive way (with a direct object that 
is the same as the subject) that you note. The <I>Oxford English 
Dictionary</I> gives several citations for intransitive uses as well, 
including an evocative one from 1549 that reads, "Yet he neuer 
<B>enioied</B> after, but in conclusyon pitifully wasted his painful 
lyfe."<p>

Grammar, then, isn't the problem.  Could the problem be that the waiter is 
telling you what to do?  And that you consider it the restaurant's job to 
provide an enjoyable experience and your prerogative to decide whether the 
restaurant has succeeded?  And that it therefore seems presumptuous for an 
employee to be commanding you, "<B>Enjoy!</B>"?  As for your doctor, 
could the problem be that you really would have been interested to know 
which he expected you to enjoy: the pulled tendon or paying the bill?  But 
now we have strayed into the realm of psychology, and that's not my 
department.<p> <br> <p> <br>

<b><i><font size=5>M</font>y boss and I have a recurring battle over the 
use of</i></b> try and,<b><i> which she insists should be</i></b> try 
to<b><i>.  She contends that to</i></b> try and<b><i> do something means to 
achieve the goal, and is therefore incorrect; but to </i></b>try to<b><i> 
do something doesn't predict success and is therefore proper.  I argue that 
to </i></b> try and <b><i> do something clearly indicates one's hope for 
success, and is therefore proper.  Who is right?</i></b><p>

<b>Steve Bone<br>
<i>Halifax, N.S.</i></b>

<p>
</I>You are--and won't the boss be surprised when you casually remark, one day 
soon, that <B>try and do better</B> and the like are examples of 
hendiadys, a device that was not infrequently used as a poetic ornament in 
Greek and Latin. Hendiadys, as H. W. Fowler explains it, is "the 
expressing of a compound notion by giving its two constituents as though 
they were independent and connecting them with a conjunction instead of 
subordinating one to the other." <B>Nice and warm</B> (as against 
<B>nicely warm</B>) is another example Fowler gives of the device as it 
crops up in English.
<p>
<br>
<p>
<br>
<b><i><font size=5>I</font> have assembled quite a stack of newspaper and magazine clippings 
that employ the phrase "high school</i></b> degree."<b><i> It annoys me very much 
when I see this instead of "high school diploma." I didn't know that high 
schools were</i></b> degree<b><i>-granting institutions.</i></b><p>

<b>Betty D. Krueger<br>
<i>Sarasota, Fla.</i></b><p>

</I>Good point.  I suspect this is one of the many things that aren't being 
taught in high school anymore.  And while we're at it: another reader, 
Irene Slaughter, of Asheville, North Carolina, has written to object to 
"She <B>graduated</B> high school"--also a good point.  
<B>Graduate</B> may be transitive ("The school 
<B>graduated</B> her with honors") but the graduating institution 
isn't allowed to be the object of the verb.  <p> <hr>

	<h4>Arts &amp; Letters</h4>
	
	July <b>4</b>, "Rings: Five Passions in World Art"--an exhibit that forms the
cornerstone of the Cultural Olympiad, held in conjunction with this summer's
Olympic Games--opens today in Atlanta. It will contain 129 works from around
the world, including Rodin's <i>The Kiss</i> and Munch's <i>The Scream</i>,
which are related to five emotions common to art and athletics: love, anguish,
triumph, awe, and joy. Previous Cultural Olympiads have been plagued by
logistical problems and criticized as awkward add-ons; this year, in response,
most of the activities (music and dance concerts, for example) will occur
within a mile or two of the Olympic Stadium, and visitors can buy packages
including tickets for both athletic and cultural events.
	
	<br clear=all>
	
	<h4>Health &amp; Safety</h4>
	
<img src="rocket.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

	If past trends hold, nearly 10,000 people will be treated in emergency rooms
this month for fireworks-related injuries--80 percent of the year's total.
However, several efforts in progress could cut the number in coming years. The
U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is in the midst of the first
comprehensive review of fireworks safety in more than 20 years. Last spring it
mandated new tests for multiple-tube mine and shell fireworks, which can tip
over and fire horizontally, and which caused the two fireworks-related deaths
of the past five years. It is reviewing standards for bottle rockets, which
account for more than half of all eye injuries from fireworks. Two years ago
the American Fireworks Standards Lab began a quality-improvement and testing
program in China, which supplies 90 percent of the fireworks used in the United
States. And representatives of more than a dozen nations have begun drafting an
international standard for fireworks.
	
	
	<br clear=all>
	
	<h4>Food</h4>
	

	July <b>1</b>, after today beef, pork, and frozen foods exported to South Korea
will carry expiration dates set by American manufacturers rather than by the
South Korean authorities, whose protectionist-motivated conservatism in this
matter has long made it impossible for some products to clear customs before
<img src="pig.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>
"expiring." The change is the result of a settlement mediated by the World
Trade Organization last year, after Korean officials confiscated a shipment of
American sausages. Beef and pork sales to South Korea--already the
third-largest overseas market for U.S. beef--are expected to jump by hundreds
of millions of dollars a year. Also this month thousands of tons of surplus
onions from the early summer harvest will be fed to sheep. Ranchers have until
now feared "onion poisoning," which can cause anemia and death. A recent USDA
study, however, indicates that mild onions--which are far cheaper than
grain--can safely make up as much as half of a sheep's diet.
	
	<br clear=all>
	
	<h4>Enivronment</h4>
	

	July <b>1</b>, some Californians may find buying an electric vehicle more
attractive financially after today, when state funds become available for
discounts of $5,000 on EVs costing less than $32,000 in the southern portion of
the state. The discounts are part of a $25 million two-year program designed to
promote alternative-fuel vehicles in California, whose Air Resources Board has
<img src="car.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>
mandated that by 2003, ten percent of the passenger vehicles sold in the state
must have zero emissions. In addition, California recently approved $1.6
million for the development of EV-charging stations in the Los Angeles area.
Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont have also set goals for zero-emission
vehicles, and Arizona will offer $2,000 tax credits to those buying EVs, along
with license plates that will allow alternative-fuel vehicles to use
high-occupancy-vehicle lanes. EVs are a federal priority as well: the
Department of Energy is paying roughly half of the EV-development costs
incurred by Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. 

	
	<br clear=all>
	<h4>The Skies</h4>

<img src="women.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>
	
	July <b>4</b>, Jupiter reaches opposition: it is on the opposite side of Earth
from the Sun. It lies overhead at midnight tonight, and will be in the sky all
night long during most of the month, near the teapot-shaped constellation
Sagittarius. <b>7</b>, the waning Moon passes close to Saturn. <b>30</b>, Full
Moon, also known this month as the Thunder, Hay, or Giant Cactus Moon. This
event falls a few hours after perigee (the time of the month when the Moon is
closest to Earth), and the combination is expected to produce the highest and
lowest tides of the year.
	
	<br clear=all>
	
	<h4>Government</h4>
	
<img src="sew.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

	July <b>1</b>, clothing imports from Southeast Asia are likely to drop after
today, when new U.S. rules for determining a garment's country of origin for
quota purposes go into effect. For the past 12 years the country of origin has
been considered to be that in which the fabric is cut. It will now be
considered to be that in which the garment is assembled--a change that will
especially affect imports from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other countries that send
cut fabric to China, where labor is less expensive, for assembly. (China's
quota is usually filled.) Domestic apparel manufacturers may benefit (although
consumers may see higher prices); also, assembly may increase in Latin American
and Caribbean countries, many of which have inexpensive labor and high or
nonexistent quotas. 
	
	<br clear=all>
	
	<h4>50 Years Ago</h4>
	
<img src="music.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

	Sir Richard Livingstone, writing in the July, 1946, issue of <i>The Atlantic
Monthly</i>: "Any attempt to train character is dangerous and must be
undertaken with full perception of its danger. Many notes must be harmonized if
the full music of the human instrument is to sound: gentleness and courage,
boldness and prudence, inquisitiveness and reverence, tolerance and firmness,
confidence and humility, stability and freedom. It is a difficult and risky
attempt to make a man, and it is tempting to turn aside from the task. But we
have only to look round to see the disastrous results of declining it, as, for
the most part, we have hitherto done."

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>I</font>N a small but rapidly growing number of American towns designers and
developers are rejecting the dominant modern methods of creating new
residential areas. They are coming to view the community-development practices
of the past few decades as a terrible blunder and returning to the
town-planning traditions of the early twentieth century and before. A new
traditionalism is on the rise, and it is affecting not only suburbs but also
big cities, where the ideal of harmoniously organized streets and public spaces
is being pursued by government agencies and private planning firms. This is not
to say that public-oriented traditionalism will quickly or easily triumph.
Suburbs increasingly are laid out as strictly private enclaves, inaccessible to
outsiders, and many urban housing complexes today are becoming amenity-filled
private refuges, divorced from their surroundings. But the revival and
reinterpretation of traditional planning ideas are winning close attention from
those who shape American housing patterns. With renewed vigor architects and
planners are asking, What constitutes a good place to live?<p>

<p>

One of the most influential new developments is a little place called <A 
HREF="http://www.lawrence.edu/dept/anthropology/new_urbanism/sside.html">Seaside</A>, which sits along a stretch of white sandy 
beachfront in the Florida Panhandle, about a hundred miles west of 
Tallahassee.  Started seven years ago, Seaside has become the most 
celebrated new American town of the decade--the subject of slide lectures 
in architectural schools and reports in housing-industry magazines, and the 
object of visits from design professionals throughout the United States.<p>

<p>

At first glance, what seems to make Seaside special is the old-fashioned
down-home style of its houses. You won't see picture windows, sliding glass
doors, or vinyl or aluminum siding. Those and other emblems of modern
homebuilding are largely prohibited in this eighty-acre community where 100
houses have been built and about 300 houses and 200 apartments eventually will
be. Seaside, an unincorporated part of Walton County, is, by regulation, a
place of wood-shingled, clapboard, and board-and-batten houses with deep front
porches and shiny tin roofs like those on old houses in rural America. Cupolas
and towers rise from some roofs, giving the skyline a picturesque, almost
whimsical air. The houses' windows follow the proportions of eighty to a
hundred years ago--predominantly tall and narrow.<p>

<p>

For at least two decades there has been a growing interest in "vernacular
architecture"--commonplace buildings of the past, embodying folk wisdom about
design and construction--and Seaside's houses tap into this even while
delivering in their interiors the light, openness, and mechanical convenience
expected in houses today. Many of Seaside's houses have living areas that are
two stories high, and in most the kitchens are easily accessible, thanks to
open interior planning. The windows may be old-fashioned in their tall, narrow
proportions, but they're used in such abundance that at night, when the lights
are turned on, the houses glow. Ceilings and interior walls are typically
covered with tongue-in-groove pine, more handsome and durable than gypsum
wallboard.<p>

<p>

The goal at Seaside has to do with more than designing pleasant individual
houses; Seaside addresses the larger issue of how to create a place where
people can live differently from the way they do in the usual suburb or resort
area. How can a new community foster a friendly, stimulating social atmosphere?
How can it make its streets and public areas inviting enough that people will
want to spend time in them? How can it achieve a pleasing visual order and
treat the natural environment intelligently while also conveniently supplying
its inhabitants' daily needs? In these matters town-planning traditions that
have been ignored for half a century are serving as a generally trustworthy
guide.<p>

<p>

Those who have learned of Seaside in the refined milieu of architectural
lecture halls are sometimes shocked to discover what this new resort town sits
next to. From the development's eastern boundary to Panama City, some thirty
miles away, the seashore is as crass and chaotic as any in America. Lining the
highway on the Gulf of Mexico are economy-grade motels, concrete-block
convenience stores, mansard-roofed refreshment stands, shops selling airbrushed
T-shirts, and a profusion of cramped housing developments, each built according
to a different pat formula--Tudor townhouses, weathered-cedar-shake apartments,
stucco-and-tile condominiums, gray clapboard row houses, rustic log cabins, and
many others. The state highway department, with unintended irony, has put up
signs designating this a "scenic route."<p>

<p>

I drove the scenic route one Thursday evening, arriving at Seaside at dusk.
Even in the fading light, Seaside was mesmerizing. It looks like a fanciful
turn-of-the-century town that has been cleaned, painted, and planted to
perfection. Every house built in Seaside is different, but within the variety
is a fundamental orderliness, established by the unifying wooden walls and
metal roofs, the substantial porches, the proportions of the windows, and a
number of other elements, among them the harmonious colors--a rainbow of
pastels. As I picked up a key left for me on the porch of the rental office and
walked to the pink cottage that would be my home for the next four days, I
noticed a number of couples strolling the streets--engaged in the common
pastime of looking at the neighbors' houses.<p>

<p>

Early the next morning I unexpectedly encountered Seaside's developer, Robert
S. Davis, attired in a Powdermilk Biscuits T-shirt, shorts, and sandals, as he
pedaled his fat-tired bike to a meeting with a builder. Davis, forty-four, a
soft-spoken man with black hair beginning to turn gray, is atypical of
developers in almost every respect. Brought up in Birmingham, Alabama, Davis
belonged to the Socialist Workers' Party during his undergraduate years at
Antioch College, in Ohio, and after graduation he recruited black and
poverty-stricken students to that reform-minded college. He later worked for a
couple of Miami developers active in the Federal Housing Authority's Section
236 program, which he sums up as "subsidizing the very rich to provide housing
for the poor."<p>

<p>


Davis had visited the Gulf since boyhood days and had acquired a dislike 
for conventional Florida resort development, with its uniformly stamped-out 
housing units close to the water and recreation facilities but far from 
shopping and other services.  About nine years ago he "did the <I>Blue 
Highways</I> number," traveling the Southeast in a red Pontiac Bonneville 
convertible with his wife, Daryl, to examine the region's old small towns, 
which he liked much better.  Davis wanted to figure out what it was that 
made the houses in those towns visually appealing and socially engaging.  
<A HREF="http://nethomes.com/Periferia/publicaciones/Quotes.HTML">Andres 
Duany</A> and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, a husband-and-wife architectural 
team educated at Princeton and Yale and now based in Miami, sometimes 
traveled along, and eventually developed a building code and a town plan 
enabling Davis to reproduce much of the old communities' physical 
character.<p>

<p>

The eighty-acre Gulf site came under Davis's control in 1979, when he inherited
it from his grandfather, who had founded a Birmingham department store. Free of
the debt pressures that impel most developers to stick to ideas so routine that
they won't startle a banker, Davis built a yellow clapboard house of his own
design on a small lot about 500 feet from the water, and began overseeing the
gradual construction of what he hoped would become an alternative model for
development.<p>

<p>

Seaside adopted a requirement that each house have a front porch, because Davis
had concluded that front porches encourage neighborly chatting and cooperation.
Unlike the strictly ornamental porches tacked on to some new suburban houses, a
front porch at Seaside must be at least eight feet deep--spacious enough that
people can use it--and must extend at least half the length of the house's
front wall.<p>

<p>

At the edge of the front yard there must be a picket fence, giving the street
an intimate scale and shielding porch-sitters somewhat from passersby. The
picket fence must be individually designed, in keeping with the Seaside
philosophy of harmonious diversity, and the distance from porch to fence
usually must be sixteen feet; pedestrians and porch-sitters consequently can
strike up a conversation without raising their voices.<p>

<p>

In walking around Seaside, I came to the conclusion that the hopes of
reestablishing a front-porch society had largely failed. Few people occupied
the porches during the hot afternoons, and after sunset the shimmering light
from TV sets and the hum of air-conditioners testified to the irresistible
appeal of climate-controlled, electronically equipped interiors, even in a town
where most of the porches are screened to provide protection from insects. Of
the people I did see sitting on porches, half were occupying side rather than
front porches, a little farther removed from the public domain. "Lately people
have been requesting of me that I give them <I>rear</I> porches," Tom Christ, who has
designed more houses at Seaside than any other architect, told me. Bushy native
plant life--mostly scrub oak--has been extensively preserved at Seaside, Christ
said, and it offers some privacy, especially at the backs of the houses.
American family life has looked toward the back yard for several decades now,
and Seaside lacks the power to shift its gaze.<p>

<p>

But the limited activity on front porches hasn't greatly damaged Davis's ideal
of a community that has an active public life. People walk the streets,
exchanging greetings and looking at what's being built. The building code, with
its clear, systematic guidelines for proportions, dimensions, and materials,
has enabled schoolteachers, grocers, and housewives to design their own
dwellings with not much more professional assistance than can be supplied by a
drafting service for $1,200. At the same time, it has forced architects in
their designs to pick up the general themes of neighboring houses.<p>

<p>

The streets themselves are inviting. "We started with dirt streets, with oyster
shell at the edges," Davis told me, "but the people who moved in decided they
wanted brick streets and were willing to pay extra for them." Drivers, seeing
the unusual pavement and hearing the rumble of bricks under their tires,
instinctively slow down. Children bike freely on the streets, people saunter
along them on the way to the beach, and nobody seems concerned about being run
over.<p>

<p>

Davis, rejecting the traffic-engineering standards of most municipalities, kept
the streets narrow. The pavement is usually eighteen feet wide--"just enough
for two cars to pass comfortably." Also, he encouraged on-street parking,
further slowing traffic. Many homeowners build garages, but they have to be
separate structures near the back of the lot, exerting as little influence as
possible on the atmosphere of the street. So well-liked are the streets that
they have siphoned off nearly all the pedestrian traffic from one of Seaside's
other innovations--a network of sandy footpaths lined by picket fences and
cutting through the middle of most blocks.<p>

<p>

Another appealing aspect of Seaside's streets is that they run straight, rather
than in the loose curves that for years have been fashionable in upper-income
suburban neighborhoods. This orderly alignment, with the fences and houses set
back from the pavement at short, regular distances, turns the street into what
Andres Duany likes to call a "public room"--a semi-enclosed outdoor area that
feels properly delineated and seems to be a place in its own right, not just a
void between buildings. The sense that the street forms an agreeable outdoor
room is an integral part of the appeal of great cities like Paris and London
and of many sought-after urban neighborhoods. In the Georgetown section of
Washington, D.C., Duany told me, "people will pay four to five hundred thousand
dollars for a house with small rooms, bad plumbing, and parking two blocks
away; it has to do with the beautiful street in front of it."<p>

<p>

"The problem with the straight street is when it stretches out forever into the
prairie," Duany said. Thus Seaside's streets, after running straight for a few
blocks, focus on a visual termination--a gazebo in the center of a traffic
circle, a bathhouse and community pool at the end of a boulevard, a
distinctively designed pavilion at the end of a street leading to the beach.
Some of the streets bend. The preference for straight streets that frame a view
does not imply that curves must always be avoided. One of Seaside's streets is
a crescent--a disciplined, well-defined curve. The emphasis is on making the
street sufficiently orderly that the buildings, fences, and trees along it can
form the public room.<p>

<p>

Public rooms like these are more lively when they lead to useful places;
someone can get a meal or mail a package or buy something by walking or biking
only a short way on Seaside's streets. Overlooking the beach is a "market area"
containing a tiny Greek Revival-style post office designed by Davis, a
bookstore, an excellent seafood restaurant and bar, a refreshment stand where
fresh lemons are squeezed for every lemonade, and a little complex of booths
around a brick plaza, selling mainly women's clothing and accessories. On the
Saturday night that I spent at Seaside, a screen was put up in the plaza and
people gathered to watch the movie <I>Agatha</I> in the open air.<p>

<p>

A larger commercial area, with a hotel, apartments, offices, a grocery store,
and other shops, is soon to be built near the center of the development; this
will turn Seaside into more of a full-fledged community. But even now Davis's
town functions fairly independently, and somewhat differently from a typical
development along the Gulf which is dependent on automobiles. Whenever I was
about to meet someone for dinner during my stay at Seaside, I instinctively
listened for the other person's car -- and then had to remind myself that there
wouldn't be any car driving up, because at Seaside people routinely walk to one
another's houses and walk from there to restaurants and other attractions.<p>

<p>

The opportunity to do without a daily commute seems to be an important lure for
some of the people who move in. Although most homeowners are part-time
residents who use Seaside as a vacation and weekend spot, I met a few people
who had moved to Seaside because they anticipated being able to start small
businesses there, within easy walking distance of home. The majority of these
people were in their fifties and sixties, and perhaps beginning to husband
their energies rather than expend them on daily transportation.<p>



<p><br>


<font size=5>B</font>UILD a better town and the world will pay plenty to live in it. "When we
started, houses were being sold for seventy-five to a hundred thousand
dollars," Davis told me. "But land prices have gone up. Fifty-by-a-hundred-foot
lots that sold for twenty-five thousand in 1982-1983 would sell for
seventy-five thousand today. And the place has become more chic and
fashionable, so people are building bigger and more complicated houses. It's
become more affluent. Today most houses sell at from a hundred and thirty to
two hundred thousand dollars. We have some houses being built that would sell
for four to five hundred thousand. The fact that it has strayed from the
original idea doesn't bother me greatly. People are investing a lot of
themselves in it. There's a pride of place."<p>

<p>

Perhaps the greatest testament to Seaside's sales appeal is the fact that the
value of property in the development has surged at the same time that
condominiums on the coast nearby have had a hard time attracting buyers. Its
success as a real-estate proposition means that Seaside is certain to have
imitators. Davis has been lecturing at architectural schools for quite a while,
but now he also gets frequent requests to speak to groups of developers and
planners. Duany, too, is in demand at real-estate gatherings, where he spreads
the message that a more compact, urbane, walkable community, with shopping and
employment close to housing, not only encourages sociability and a less harried
way of living but also makes financial sense. "The newest idea in planning is
the nineteenth-century town," Duany told a conference of Florida apartment
developers last year. "That's what is really selling."<p>

<p>

And why not? For twenty years there has been a surge of affection for old
precincts of American cities and towns. Historic preservation, once considered
a hobby of the elite, has become an industry. The interest in old houses has
led many developers to incorporate in new houses some of the features that made
the old houses appealing. If learning from the past has been valuable at the
scale of the individual house, why not try it at the scale of a small town?
Many things need to be relearned if this is to happen widely, but the
pioneering has taken place, and conditions appear auspicious for the number of
revival towns to grow.<p>

<p>

A promising neo-traditional development now under construction is the Harbor
Center business district in Grand Harbor, a project of Schaub Communities in
Vero Beach, Florida. The waterfront business area has been designed by one of
Duany's former employers, the New York architect Robert A. M. Stern. "It's
meant to be a Mediterranean village," Stern says of a succession of three-story
buildings that he has formed into a 1,200-foot-long crescent. The buildings
will hug the sidewalks along the main street and form a rhythmic, consistent
backdrop to the Intracoastal Waterway, across the street. When visiting
ground-level stores and offices, pedestrians will have the choice of walking in
the open or under a continuous arcade embellished with small courts. The roof
of the arcade will provide terraces and visual privacy for 116 apartments
directly above the businesses. In another section of Grand Harbor, Stern has
designed sixty-seven townhouses arranged around a series of paved courts with
plantings in the center. All of Stern's work at Grand Harbor will be carried
out in stucco and tile, making it reminiscent of one of his heroes, Addison
Mizner, who early in this century designed the beautiful shopping district of
Palm Beach.<p>

<p>

Another neo-traditional development, Mashpee Commons, whose design principles
are derived from those of old New England towns, is being built on Cape Cod
eleven miles west of Hyannis, Massachusetts. The Fields Point Partnership,
which owns a twelve-acre shopping center and 163 surrounding acres in the town
of Mashpee, devised a plan for converting the mansard-roofed shopping center
into something much like a small-town business district, with a new town green
to be built nearby. Since 1985 new two-story brick and clapboard buildings,
with their storefronts opening onto brick-edged sidewalks, have gone up. Across
narrow, newly built streets the stores face the shopping-center buildings,
which were put up in the 1960s and now have new windows and doors and sidewalks
along their perimeter to create an environment oriented to pedestrians. Fields
Point wanted to create residential neighborhoods that would be closely tied to
the downtown, so in 1986, after learning about Seaside, the company
commissioned Duany and Plater-Zyberk to plan a development of homes on small
lots within walking distance of the business center.<p>

<p>

There are many traditions for the designers of neo-traditional towns to draw
on, and the choice of which heritage to use is influenced heavily by geography,
climate, and other characteristics of the location. For Riverfront, a 100-acre
development of houses, offices, and shops that Duany and Plater-Zyberk are
planning south of Manchester, New Hampshire, "our model is the New England town
at its most cranky and idiosyncratic," Duany says. A landscape architect has
walked the site and is laying out straight streets that will connect important
points, resulting in a network more distinctive than a grid. For Friday
Mountain, a 550-acre town that Duany and Plater-Zyberk are laying out southwest
of Austin, Texas, the dimensions are distinctively Texan, with streets and
squares much broader than those in the East. Trees planted in rows, not in the
irregular clumps that most landscapers favor, will break up the big open spaces
and generate a sense of enclosure for the community, which is intended
primarily for retirement-age people.<p>

<p>

The 3,500-acre site of Duany and Plater-Zyberk's biggest project, Blount
Springs, north of Birmingham, Alabama, is hilly. Consequently, dispersed
houses--in a more suburban pattern than those of many other neo-traditional
towns--will sit along curving streets that fit the irregular terrain. On the
hilltops will be focal points--greens surrounded by a denser perimeter of
houses and one or two shops. The most tightly built part of the site will be a
downtown containing a railroad station. The designers hope to have passenger
service restored on what is now a freight line, to encourage the onetime
mineral-springs resort to function like a railroad suburb. This seems an iffy
proposition, but in any event light industry is to be present in the community,
which is expected to attract a wide range of income groups, from working class
on up.<p>

<p>

Without question, Duany and Plater-Zyberk have emerged as the masters and the
most prolific practitioners of this new-old form of design. Still other
projects their fourteen-member firm is currently working on are developments
near Annapolis, Maryland, and Savannah, Georgia. The architects were stimulated
by Robert Stern's historical studies of British and American suburbs and by the
European urban theorist Leon Krier, who advocates a return to small cities on a
human scale. Duany and Plater-Zyberk immersed themselves in American town plans
from the 1600s to the period of John Nolen, a nearly forgotten planner who
between 1907 and 1937 drew up plans for more than seventy-five cities and
towns. "We are really concentrating on American conditions and American
prototypes," Duany says. "American street space is a lot bigger than European
street space, and it depends on trees, planted in steady rows, to obtain its
spatial definition."<p>

<p>

Duany and Plater-Zyberk have seen to it that the emerging generation of
designers is exposed to their thinking. Plater-Zyberk can be coldly academic in
lectures, but Duany, who grew up on Long Island and in Spain after his parents
fled the Cuban revolution, frequently brings passion to his presentations. He
has likened his firm's tactics to some of Fidel Castro's. Castro bought radio
transmitters to "broadcast the myth of the revolution" while the dictator
Batista still held power, "and the revolution happened," Duany told graduate
students at Yale last year. "What we are proposing is to get hold of the radio
transmitters of America, of the architectural radio transmitters, and do it
that way"--bringing about a neo-traditional revolution in town design. One kind
of transmitter is a high-profile architectural school; Duany, thirty-eight, and
Plater-Zyberk, thirty-seven, have trained students at Yale, Harvard, and the
University of Miami. Other transmitters are the building and urban-design codes
adopted by developments and local governments. Duany and Plater-Zyberk seek,
and often get, the job of writing the codes; they are well aware that the
person who draws up the codes usually wields more power than the architect who
actually designs the buildings.<p>

<CENTER><font size=4>
<B>Design Principles</B></font>
</CENTER>

<p>

<font size=5>Y</font>OUNG designers and independent-minded developers are drawn to this
neo-traditional revolution out of disenchantment with the mess that Americans
have made of their communities. Even communities that were supposed to
represent an escape from dull subdivisions and roadside commercial clutter have
been spoiled. Cape Cod, for example, has seen its resident population double in
two decades, and the growth has been badly managed. This was the underlying
reason why Arnold B. Chace, forty, who became the president of Fields Point
Partnership in 1979, decided that Mashpee Commons should be planned on
traditional principles, breaking the modern pattern of dispersing population
and services in a way that lacks a symbolic and functional center. The shopping
center surrounded by asphalt parking lot that Fields Point had built in Mashpee
in the 1960s needed to be transformed.<p>

<p>

"We both hate shopping centers," says Douglas S. Storrs, a longtime friend of
Chace's who is Fields Point's vice-president of planning and development. "We
don't think shopping centers are enjoyable places to shop. We like places that
meet the full needs of residents and visitors."<p>

<p>

To generate the "sense of place" that neo-traditional towns strive for, civic
and religious buildings are usually needed, and the developer often must donate
land in order to get them. Beyond simply attracting such buildings, the
developer must position them where they will make an impact. In Mashpee the
civic and religious buildings cluster around a new town green with a bandstand
at its center. A town library has been built on one side of the green. On
another side will be a Catholic church, and on a third side a row of shops. The
final building facing the green will be either a town hall, built by the town
of Mashpee on land provided by Fields Point, or an inn. In the business
district, Fields Point sought, and got, a post office--an important generator
of activity. The post office is recessed behind a small plaza bordered by
shops. An arcade that runs through one of the 1960s buildings focuses on the
plaza, helping to tie the downtown together and give it dignity.<p>

<p>

Getting chain-operated businesses to cooperate can be difficult. Most of
America is designed according to economic and engineering formulas that have
nothing to do with urbanity and social interaction. When plans were made for a
six-screen movie complex in Mashpee Commons, the theater operator at first
wanted to do things in a standard way, placing the theater's entrance where it
would face a parking lot rather than the center of town. However, Orr &amp;
Taylor, of New Haven, Connecticut, the architectural firm that was hired by
Fields Point to design the theater, was able to persuade the theater operator
that the entrance to the complex should be on a public plaza and that instead
of having typically long, blank exterior walls there should be shops lining
part of the theater's perimeter. "Because of the amenity and street life, we
believe this will attract people," Robert Orr says.<p>

<p>

One of the hardest challenges for any development that is intended to offer a
compact, stimulating, and walkable environment is how to provide sufficient
parking. "To make retail viable, you must attract more than the people who can
walk to it," Robert Stern points out. "The struggle is to get all those cars
there and yet retain the quality that you want." Mashpee Commons employs a
typical multi-faceted solution. Some parking is allowed on the newly built
streets, which have sidewalks. The bulk of the parking is provided in lots that
are broken into segments by rows of plantings and by sidewalks, reducing the
conflict between pedestrian and automobile. The goal is to get people walking
past storefronts, rather than through undifferentiated stretches of asphalt, as
soon as possible.<p>

<p>

Many of the neo-traditional towns that have been built or planned so far are in
resort areas, but the same design principles can be applied anywhere, including
places where people live full time. "The nineteenth-century towns," Duany says,
"are completely viable prototypes."<p>

<p>

"It's not enough just to look like a town," he adds. "It has to function like a
town"--which means that it should be able to govern itself flexibly and
democratically. To that end Duany and Plater-Zyberk have worked with Doris
Goldstein, a Jacksonville attorney, to develop town charters that encourage
popular decision-making after the developer's work is mostly completed. Instead
of lawyerly homeowners'-association documents, which usually make it hard for a
suburban or resort development to do anything other than maintain the status
quo, the documents drawn up by Goldstein allow people to face one another in
town meetings and vote on whether to alter the community. If the residents want
to knock down a building to put in a community pool, they can do so without
becoming entangled in documents that only an attorney can readily understand.
"That's the last brick in the arch," Duany says. "I think it's very
important."<p>

<p>

Most current municipal codes make it impossible to develop neo-traditional
communities that mix offices, shopping, and housing and provide compact,
tightly defined open spaces. But this can be expected to change as people
evaluate the advantages of revival towns. The prevailing "clean" zoning, which
tries to separate different activities and contrasting kinds of buildings into
widely scattered areas, is due for reconsideration now that the advantages of
more-unified towns are being demonstrated. The neo-traditionalists may not have
banished all problems, but they are making a strong case: through their designs
we can again have a less fragmented community and public areas that are a
pleasure to inhabit.<p>

<p>

<font size=5>W</font>HAT the designers of neo-traditional small towns would really like to
reorganize is the American suburb. The suburbs are where about 40 percent of
Americans live, and the neo-traditionalists see the prevailing suburban layouts
as causing daily frustration. Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, among
other designers, find fault particularly with master-planned suburban
communities, which since the 1960s, when they began to flourish, have often
been depicted as a thoughtful alternative to the more prosaic American pattern
of houses plunked down on treeless land and sharing few amenities.<p>

<p>

Master-planned communities--usually called planned-unit developments--provide
an organized, comprehensively designed environment with a character that people
will pay extra to get. Since the late 1960s, according to <I>Builder</I>, the magazine
of the National Association of Home Builders, approximately 100,000
planned-unit developments have been built in the United States. They range from
one to 53,000 acres and have three traits in common: shared amenities, building
and design restrictions, and a flexible zoning plan that provides common open
space, often in compensation for clusters of higher-density housing in part of
the development.<p>

<p>

Today planned-unit developments are home to one tenth of America's population.
Some of the newer ones are lavish indeed. "The evolution of planned communities
has gotten to the point where people are looking for higher-quality amenities,"
says Henry Skokowski, the president of Urban Design Studio, a firm in West Palm
Beach, Florida, which lays out developments in several counties on Florida's
Atlantic coast. Probably the most extreme example of amenity-upgrading is the
recent trend toward building "equestrian communities," developments with
horseback-riding facilities. These have been built or planned in such places as
Scottsdale, Arizona; St. George, Utah; Lake County, Illinois; and the outskirts
of San Diego. The nation's premier equestrian community is the Palm Beach Polo
and Country Club, which sprawls across 2,200 acres of flat Florida terrain, a
dozen miles inland from the Palm Beach International Airport. Palm Beach Polo,
as it's known, is a tract on which homes ranging from $200,000 townhouses to
individually designed houses that sell for over $1 million are augmented by
extensive recreational amenities, most notably ten polo fields, two practice
fields, and a yellow-striped polo stadium. To avoid missing affluent homebuyers
who are not entranced with polo, the development offers forty-five holes of
golf, two croquet lawns, and other elements of the leisure landscape as well.<p>

<p>

At Boca Pointe, a less expensive, 1,019-acre development in Boca Raton,
Florida, 40 percent of the site consists of parks, greenbelts, lakes, and
fairways, many of which have been stretched out so that they are on display
through the glassy rear walls of the houses. "First choice is a water view,
second is a golf-course view," says Rhoda Charles, the marketing director of
the development where prices start at slightly above $100,000 for a
two-bedroom, two-bath garden apartment and mount in many steps to more than
$900,000 for the most expensive custom houses. Clubhouses and recreation
centers for racquet sports, swimming, aerobics, and other forms of exercise
contribute importantly to the marketing of Boca Pointe and of many other
planned-unit developments across the country.<p>

<p>

The builders of master-planned developments, like the builders of
neo-traditional towns, are fond of saying that they are creating "communities."
The method by which they are doing this, however, often involves setting the
master-planned community physically apart from its neighbors. Unlike Seaside,
which has purposely connected its streets to those of an adjoining older
development, suburban planned-unit developments take pride in being
self-contained. Nearly every section of Boca Pointe sits behind gates
supervised by guards. Throughout the United States gates are rapidly gaining
acceptance, especially in upper-income and retirement developments, where they
are usually supervised around the clock by guards or operated by security
codes. In less expensive housing the developer more frequently builds an
elaborate entrance, with or without a gate house and lets the residents decide
whether to pay to staff it.<p>

<p>

So widespread is the trend toward impressive entrances and security checkpoints
that <I>Builder</I> last year published recommendations on how to design them. "A
project entry will have greater visual impact and feel more inviting to
prospects if it's set back from the street," the magazine's "Design Workshop"
advised. Embodying this sales-winning principle, the entrances at Boca Pointe
sweep back from the street, often in the form of long, curving stucco walls
embellished with fountains, waterfalls, flowers, and palm trees. The lavish
landscape features punctuate the transition from public world to private
enclave, and promise a community within. Whether a genuine functioning
community actually exists behind the checkpoints is another matter.<p>

<p>

Certainly the landscape on view within the enclave is meant to project an image
of community. Often the outdoor environment avoids the anonymity of standard
municipal-grade street furnishings. It's not uncommon to find the stop signs
and street signs made of sandblasted wood instead of metal. Streetlights are
ornamental and close to the ground, on a human scale, like many of the
beautiful streetlights used in American cities in the early years of the
century. Mailboxes are sometimes treated as an important design element; in
parts of Boca Pointe clusters of mailboxes sit under green canvas awnings in
the center of landscaped cul-de-sacs. The sidewalks and driveways may be
concrete that has been shaped to resemble stone and stained to complement the
colors of the houses, whose walls and roofs have been given a consistent,
coordinated appearance. Plantings are designed to weave the front yards into a
seamless, meandering garden, maintained by the homeowners' association. All of
this, Rhoda Charles says, "contributes to a very secure and charming enclave
versus a more accessible, open kind of community."<p>

<p>

But what is immediately apparent is the scarcity of informal socializing within
many of the enclaves. On a mild evening I drove through one section after
another of Boca Pointe, where some 2,000 houses and apartments have been sold,
and saw hardly anyone out walking or in conversation with neighbors. The
landscape's beauty felt embalmed. From Boca Pointe, I drove to Charleston
Place, a nearby neo-traditional development that Duany and Plater-Zyberk,
extrapolating from the development patterns of old sections of Charleston,
South Carolina, had laid out with orderly rows of townhouses closely facing
narrow, straight streets. In this suburban development people were out walking
in twos, threes, and fours, many of them chatting with their neighbors. Some
were strolling along narrow linear walkways of brick, which run behind the
walled back yards and have rose trellises above them.<p>

<p>

The well-defined, pedestrian-oriented outdoor space helps Charleston Place
generate informal community activity, not simply a community image. A major
defect of the shared outdoor space in planned-unit developments is that it is
rarely defined tightly enough to invite people. The buildings, even when
beautiful, are not arranged to create places that feel semi-enclosed and
therefore special.<p>

<p>

The streets and walkways in suburban planned-unit developments suffer from
another deficiency as well: they connect to few of the things that people need
in their everyday lives. Recreational features may be abundant, but they are
not necessarily within walking distance. For example, in Boca Pointe where
there are twenty-two separate residential areas, a brochure for one of them
boasts, "El Dorado is the only community within Boca Pointe to have direct,
permanent walking access to the Tennis and Aquatic Center and the Country
Club."<p>

<p>

This lack of connection except by automobile stems partly from a procedure by
which the developments are commonly laid out. Often the land planner first
fixes the location of major components, such as the curvy spine road, the
recreational amenities, and separate residential areas. Then each residential
area is assigned a builder, who lays out the streets and walkways in virtual
isolation from the residential areas nearby. Early in the construction process
a residential area, often ten to twenty acres, is called a building pod. When
the builder's model homes are ready for the public, the terminology suddenly
changes, like a frog turning into a prince: the pod becomes a "village" with a
kiss from the marketing staff. The size of the village frequently reflects the
developer's desire for a certain housing density and the builder's desire for a
tract that can comfortably be brought to market in two years or so. But the
result is often a village too small to have services within its boundaries and
too isolated to provide easy pedestrian access to services outside.<p>

<p>

<p>
<br>
<p>

<p>

<font size=5>A</font> PLANNED-UNIT development would not necessarily have to emulate a
neo-traditional town to avoid this problem. Master-planned communities could
simply learn from the most admired "new towns" begun in the 1960s, such as
Columbia, Maryland, and Miami Lakes, northwest of Miami, Florida. In Columbia
the size of residential areas was determined primarily by the number of
households needed to support an elementary school. The Rouse Company, as
developer, insisted that within a block of the school there be a swimming pool,
a community building, and a convenience store, and that people be able to walk
or bike to these facilities without crossing any major streets. Three to five
neighborhoods made up a village, which offered more facilities, including a
supermarket, a bank branch, and other businesses--also accessible by the
community's forty-seven miles of walking and biking paths, as well as by car.<p>

<p>

Lester Collins, the landscape architect who laid out the 3,000-acre Miami Lakes
development, says that communities like these are able to offer a more
satisfying daily living pattern than most planned-unit developments provide,
because they are not afraid to mix housing of different densities and places to
work and shop. Miami Lakes has at its core a Main Street town center with
stores at ground level and offices and apartments on the second and third
floors. Twenty-two thousand people now live in Miami Lakes, and 8,000 work in
offices and light industry there.<p>

<p>

In contrast, many planned-unit developments limit opportunities for working or
shopping or finding child care within the development, and thus force their
residents onto the highways, exacerbating congestion. The penchant of
developers of planned-unit developments for connecting them to outside roads at
only a few points makes matters worse. James Minuto, of the Southern California
Association of Governments, says that the notorious traffic jams in southern
Orange County are partly attributable to the scarcity of streets running
through the area's many large planned-unit developments. "You have a real
problem when there are no cross streets and you don't have a grid. There's a
lack of alternative paths."<p>

<p>

The circulation systems that do exist in master-planned communities often
meander so capriciously that they sow confusion. "Getting directions to
somebody's 'villa' in a typical Hilton Head development is an exercise in
futility," says Robert Davis, of Seaside. By the same token, it can be almost
impossible to find an address in a suburban planned-unit development if you
have the misfortune to be invited there at night. I mentioned the problem of
bafflingly arbitrary street organization to Roy Rogers, the vice-president of
planning for Arvida/JMV Partners' 10,000-acre Weston project, west of Fort
Lauderdale, which exhibits the usual preference for an abundance of curves and
an infrequency of through streets. He replied that Weston provides a string of
"mental bread crumbs" to mark the way. "We give you visual landmarks--a
windmill, windows of water, unique groupings of landscape material, a school
and park, different architectural styles." After leaving his office I drove
past an unstaffed gatehouse into one of Weston's neighborhoods and within three
minutes was lost in the unpredictably meandering streets. How odd that in a
country based on mobility, where the average person moves once every five
years, the streets in so many places are guaranteed to make all but
stay-at-homes lose their way. One of the reforms advocated by the planners of
neotraditional towns is a comprehensible street system, with landmarks that
truly do help people orient themselves.<p>

<p>

There are signs, here and there, of growing suburban interest in re-creating
the order and charm of well-designed traditional towns. Some of these signs are
superficial, like the trend toward naming shopping centers "town centers" or
dressing them up in old-fashioned architectural ornament. Some are more
serious, like the movement toward integrating stores with offices in complexes
that are more public-oriented than the usual suburban shopping mall. Sasaki
Associates, of Watertown, Massachusetts, one of the biggest firms involved in
large-scale land planning, recently collaborated with Bower Lewis
Thrower/Architects to create Princeton Forrestal Village, a suburban shopping
and office complex modeled after early-twentieth-century small-town business
districts. The development, in Plainsboro Township, New Jersey, is organized
around a two-block Main Street, with a hotel facing a square. The project
includes a day-care center "The forms are very traditional," says Richard F.
Galehouse, a planner at Sasaki. "It's considered very much of a new wave in
retailing. It's meant to deal with the lack of amenities for people near their
work during the business day."<p>

<p>

Princeton Forrestal Village provides outdoor areas that are much more
pedestrian-oriented than the vast parking lots surrounding suburban malls.
Nonetheless, Duany refers to the project as an example of the "town style"
applied to shopping and office complexes that remain dismally dependent on
access by motor vehicles. A genuine town, Duany says, has housing integrated
into the shopping and office area or close enough to it that residents can
reach the commercial center without driving. One example of this, now being
planned by Sasaki and RTKL Associates, is the town center in Reston, Virginia,
one of the 1960s "new towns." After several years of construction, the town
center will contain almost two million square feet of offices, two 500-room
hotels, and 600 housing units.<p>

<p>

"The model for the Reston town center is the traditional American street with
cars and sidewalks," says Alan Ward, an urban designer for Sasaki. The initial
buildings will focus on a plaza with a grand fountain. The second phase, to be
built several years from now, will have a town green or an urban park with
buildings at every edge. The original expectation for Reston was that the town
center would be designed like a suburban shopping center. Ward says that the
shift at Reston points up two factors that are beginning to alter the notion of
how to plan suburban developments. One is suburban land prices, which in many
places are so high that "you can no longer use the suburban model of the
building standing alone." The other is the perception of "just how bad those
buildings are," especially for the pedestrian. "Planners and designers have
looked at earlier models," Ward says, "like Country Club Plaza, in Kansas City,
that offer a humane walking environment and also let you 'shop the street' in
your car."<p>

<p>

It seems to me inevitable that a growing number of suburban developments will
break away from the prevailing practices and begin to place housing closer to
offices and shops and other services, in some cases with the more tightly
defined outdoor spaces that give places like Seaside, Mashpee Commons, and
Charleston Place their magic. In suburbs where child care and other services
are close by, parents don't have to spend so many of their free moments
driving. The growing number of people who work at home are nearer to the things
they need. The isolating planned-unit development will continue to be built,
but in a country where traffic seems to be getting worse and where the amount
of time available to two-worker families is tightly limited, there will be more
demand for something more efficient. America has been rich enough for some time
to build the kind of planned-unit developments that suit its fears and
vanities. It can also build towns that deal with the need for human contact and
for conveniently placed services, and offer the joy of well-formed open
spaces.<p>

<B>Public Pleasure Versus Private Refuge</B></font>
</CENTER>

<p>

<p>

<font size=5>S</font>OME of the most interesting work in community design is taking place not in
the nation's suburbs but in its cities. There are two strongly differing
viewpoints on how to design large urban housing developments today. One focuses
on celebrating the public environment. The other tries to pull away from it, to
a private, secure domain. Each of these attitudes is wielding considerable
influence over the character of urban areas. On the one hand, some of the
country's most respected designers are attempting to inject dignity, order, and
human activity into cities by organizing new buildings around public streets
and public parks, squares, and waterfront esplanades. On the other hand, much
of the development that goes on around the country is predicated on the more
reclusive attitude of wishing to retreat to private sanctuaries.<p>

<p>

The emphasis on establishing an orderly, formal public environment is in part a
strong reaction against the modern planning patterns of the 1950s and 1960s,
which increasingly fragmented American cities with arbitrarily placed plazas
and towers that pulled away from one another and from the street. It became
obvious that more constancy and order were needed. A prime example of the
change in thinking is the residential portion of Battery Park City, a
ninety-two-acre office and residential development along the Hudson River next
to New York City's financial district.<p>

<p>

The Battery Park City Authority adopted its original development plan in 1969,
but only one group of residential structures was built in accordance with these
guidelines--a 1,712-unit apartment complex called Gateway Plaza. This cluster
of concrete apartment towers, with lower buildings on its perimeter, stands
aloof from the traffic of South End Avenue, one of the larger new streets built
on the landfill site. To reach the towers' lobbies, you have to pass through
Gateway Park, an irregularly shaped park area that has curving walkways and
evergreens growing on little mounds--a bit of pastoralism in the city. The
greenery is not meant for everyone: a sign announces FOR RESIDENTS' USE ONLY.
The Authority envisioned many clusters of residential towers like this, but
retreating from the street produced poor results. What faces the sidewalk and
street on South End Avenue is a dull row of ground-floor stores with two
stories of drab-looking parking ramp above. Something different was needed.<p>

<p>

In 1979 the Battery Park City Authority adopted a revised master plan,
developed by the design partnership of Alexander Cooper and Stanton Eckstut,
who have since established separate New York firms. The new plan puts
landscaped areas largely in the public realm and invests them with formality. A
side street named Rector Place has in its center a public park something like
the lovely old Gramercy Park, without the locked gates. Semicircular where it
meets South End Avenue, the park is dignified and orderly, with small shrubs
above a granite base, three-foot-high hedges, beds of
raspberry-and-ivory-colored tulips, and a flowering crab-apple tree in the
center.<p>

<p>

On the next street to the north a fascinating sculpture, Ned Smyth's <I>Upper
Room</I>, which has columns around its perimeter and a table at one edge suggestive
of the Last Supper, holds people's attention. The sculpture connects Albany
Street to a magnificent esplanade that the Authority has constructed along the
Hudson. Sitting on benches from the 1939 World's Fair, people look off toward
the Statue of Liberty and a not entirely dull vista of Jersey City.<p>

<p>

The new buildings at Battery Park City seem in accord with their setting--a
consequence of the design code, which requires architects to form the apartment
buildings' exteriors into a consistent "street wall" with stone on the bottom
two stories, orange brick on the walls above, prominent cornice lines, and
non-rectangular peaks. The elements that have made traditional New York
apartment-building exteriors gracious and neighborly--part of an ensemble that
confers elegance on boulevards and parks--have been turned into a set of
guidelines, within which the designers and developers are still free to
exercise a moderate amount of imagination.<p>

<p>

"Making public places is what New York is really about," Eckstut says. "How
many projects do you know that are as successful as Park Avenue or Riverside
Drive?" The positioning of harmonious buildings against open space--at Battery
Park City, as on Park Avenue--creates the grandeur associated with cities at
their best. The public spaces at Battery Park City are more than attractive
decoration; they invite use. When I visited, people were sitting on the green
benches along Rector Park's herringbone brick walks, turning <I>Upper Room</I> into a
noon-hour lunchroom, and walking, jogging, and relaxing along the esplanade.<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HROUGHOUT the United States, municipalities are revising their zoning codes to
encourage uniform street walls and dignified, orderly public places. "Cities
are rejecting piecemeal towers in parks," says Jonathan Barnett, of New York,
an urban-design consultant to cities across the country. "We've gone back and
said the original zoning codes [from prior to the 1950s] were not that far
wrong." Public agencies and private developers are commissioning urban-design
firms to organize neglected sites--such as old rail yards and waterfronts--and
to give them a traditional urban character. Ehrenkrantz Group &amp; Eckstut
Architects has revised plans for Newport, a development along the Hudson in
Jersey City which by 1993 is expected to be one of the East Coast's major new
communities, with 10,000 housing units, 1.4 million square feet of shops, and
4.3 million square feet of office space on about 300 acres near the Holland
Tunnel. The new plan puts more emphasis on an appealing urban streetscape with
well-defined streets, squares, and parks. Along the East River in the Borough
of Queens, the New York design firms of The Gruzen Partnership and Beyer
Blinder Belle are laying out a seventy-acre project, which includes housing,
offices, shops, and recreation facilities, on a regular street grid. "The grid
streets will make the waterfront more visible and accessible and bring people
from inner Queens to the public riverfront promenade," I. P. Torrey, Beyer
Blinder Belle's director of planning and development, says.<p>

<p>

In the Cityfront Center project, in Chicago, Alexander Cooper + Partners, of
New York, has organized sixty acres of mostly vacant industrial land, at the
edge of downtown near Lake Michigan and the Chicago River, into conventionally
sized blocks with public streets, instead of creating monolithic "superblocks"
with interior or elevated walkways, as was once the fashion in big urban
developments. The buildings, containing 22 million square feet of offices,
shops, housing, and other space, focus primarily on streets and public open
areas--including two parks, a plaza, a court, and an esplanade. These, the
designers say, "break a large project into distinctive 'places.'"<p>

<p>

"We try to link with or reinforce the existing place, to complement what's
already there," Brian Shea, who designed the project along with Cooper, says.
"It's a return to the notion of connection. Battery Park City has been very
influential. People are looking at making parts of cities that will become
extensions of what is familiar." Eckstut contrasts this with the "private"
orientation that still pervades much American zoning. Too often "all the
buildings are trying to pull away," he says, "trying to protect themselves from
their neighbors."<p>

<p>

<p>
<br>
<p>

<p>

<font size=5>I</font>N fact, while the neo-traditional public orientation championed by urban
designers like Cooper, Eckstut, and the partners in Beyer Blinder Belle is one
major direction in current urban design, the movement in the opposite
direction, toward emphasizing secluded internal landscapes, is also widespread.
Many urban housing developments are being planned and promoted as a refuge from
everything beyond their boundaries. The more discordant the surrounding area,
the greater the tendency to establish a private world containing outdoor space
and shared amenities from which nonresidents are excluded. In the Studio City
section of Los Angeles, I visited one such complex--Studio Colony, a seven-acre
apartment development bordered by aging apartment buildings, a heavily traveled
commercial street, a freeway, and a flood-control basin. Studio Colony's 450
apartments, in a series of three- and four-story buildings with parking
underneath, are reached by passing through a gate where a guard screens out
unauthorized visitors.<p>

<p>

The apartments, which range from 426-square-foot, $535-a-month studios to
$1,200 two-bedroom units, feature varied ceiling heights and entrances placed
diagonally for dramatic effect. The main attraction, though, is the assortment
of gathering places, such as irregularly shaped courtyards that serve forty to
sixty apartments each. The major common area, accessible to all the residents,
has an outdoor swimming pool and terrace next to a meeting room, a gymnasium,
racquetball courts, and other indoor facilities. Above this area rises an
abstractly patterned clock tower--the designers' attempt to give Studio Colony
a strong focal point.<p>

<p>

What Studio Colony does not do is shape the outdoor areas into coherent,
genuinely inviting spaces; it is hard to imagine that anyone would want to walk
from one end of Studio Colony to the other, even once. Each of Studio Colony's
buildings sits back from the private street at a different angle, making it
impossible for the open space to feel well defined. Berkus Group Architects,
working for Forest City Dillon &amp; Bluffside Development Company, designed a
single building and then stamped it out several times without regard to how
unharmoniously the group of buildings stood on the awkward, dog's-leg-shaped
site. This happens all the time. Architects design a building when they ought
to be designing the open space that will give the development its overall
character.<p>

<p>

When designers do pay attention to the shapes of the open space, unfortunately
they often employ the predominant California style--now a national style--of
twisting and turning large complexes and their grounds, as if to promise the
viewer a delightful surprise around every bend, whereas what the viewer finds
is just more of the same at a different angle. The assumption seems to be that
irregular configurations of buildings and open space make large developments
seem less monolithic and oppressive. Sometimes this is true. But often the lack
of a convincing order makes the outdoor environment simply not worth
exploring.<p>

<p>

If urban housing developments are going to be designed as refuges, a 112-unit
townhouse complex called Bridgepoint, in southwest Miami, represents a better
model of how to organize the shared internal landscape. At the entrance to this
grayish-pink stucco complex, designed by Rafael Portuondo, Rolando Llanes, and
Lariano Forero for a local developer, Interdevco, stands a classical-inspired
gatehouse. From there you can see down a straight street lined with trees to
the center of the development, where two gazebos sit beside a small
watercourse, and then on to the swimming pool and bathhouse at the far end of
the complex. The townhouses, which sold for $98,000 to $120,000, are a series
of straightforward forty-foot-wide buildings, which get their variety not from
any nervous twisting and turning but from a series of projections on their
facades--balconies, walled courtyards, and various rooms extending in a
rhythmic sequence. Walking through the complex, you get a sense of being in a
pleasant public room--at some points wider than others, and opening up to views
of narrow waterways in the center, but always calmly composed. The fifteen-acre
complex exudes the rare quality of stateliness. In American cities obviously
anxious about crime, such dignity and tranquillity should be worth striving
for. Pink walls, in which an arch at one corner frames a view into the complex,
extend around much of Bridgepoint's perimeter.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE critical question for American cities is whether they can somehow both
present an engaging personality that attracts the public and enlivens street
life, and provide quieter, restricted outdoor areas that afford relief from
noise and commotion. Cornerstone Development Company, of Seattle, has come to
find that the challenge can be met--but only if the division between public
territory and restricted open spaces is understood and enforced.<p>

<p>

In 1982, in Seattle, Cornerstone built Hillclimb Court, a roughly U-shaped
complex, designed by Olson/Walker Architects, containing offices and shops and
thirty-five condominiums along Western Avenue, and a terraced courtyard in the
center of the U. which offers views northward to the comings and goings at the
city's busy Pike Place Market. More recently Cornerstone developed the initial
phase of a ten-acre housing, shopping, entertainment, and marina complex called
RiverPlace, along the Willamette River at the edge of downtown Portland,
Oregon. At Hillclimb Court the weak security of the courtyard--which is
protected only by thick, bushy plantings--hindered sales. At RiverPlace some
prospective townhouse buyers were troubled when on tours they noticed that some
private patios open directly onto a courtyard street, which the public can walk
through during the day.<p>

<p>

"We learned some things," says Virginia Anderson, a vice-president of
Cornerstone. "If you're doing an urban project that has landscaped private
areas, if you're not able to secure them they're a deficit. People's initial
joy at seeing a private landscape is quickly lost if the landscape is not
secure." Cornerstone has since installed security fencing, in an unobtrusive
design, along the border of Hillclimb Court's courtyard. At RiverPlace, where
158 clapboard-sided condominiums have been built, and are selling for $85,000
to $190,000, the company has ensured security by putting fences and plantings
between patios and the public courtyard. The other courtyards offer access
solely to residents, and the condos that face the strictly private courtyards
sell better.<p>

<p>

Nonetheless, RiverPlace provides an inviting public setting. A restaurant, a
grocery store, a bookseller, and other shops occupy its ground floor, facing a
public riverfront esplanade, while three stories of condominiums rise from the
shops' concrete roof. As Alan Grainger, a Seattle architect in charge of
RiverPlace, puts it, "You don't feel left out because you couldn't get into the
courtyard. There are other attractions."<p>

<p>

Urban developments surrender much of their potential, the Cornerstone team
believes, if they attempt only to be secure private environments and do not
create a walkable public environment. In line with the urban-design critique
that Jane Jacobs set forth in her still influential 1961 book, <I>The Death and
Life of Great American Cities</I>, Virginia Anderson says that everyone feels safer
if a mixture of activities is going on close by and there are plenty of "eyes
on the street." She says, "You need more activity than just residential to
create interest and to create a sense of security."<p>

<p>

If traditional, public-oriented ways of designing American communities are to
be revived, what is required is a skillful balancing act. The things that
provoked the decline of traditional methods of community design--among them
cars and a desire to escape the disturbances and sometimes cramped living of
compact, multi-purpose neighborhoods--are with us as much as ever. The
designers and developers who work in a traditional vein must take these into
account while at the same time delivering the satisfactions that were abundant
in cities and towns several decades ago.<p>

<p>

The neo-traditionalists stand to make an impact, because the frustrations of
modern, scattered, cluttered development are all too evident today and because
their holistic approach attempts to meet many different needs--for convenience,
efficiency, beauty, and connection to a broader swath of humanity. The
neotraditionalists sense an emptiness in American life and seek to fill the
void through community design. Theirs is a potent idea, and one not likely to
pass out of fashion soon. After all, it is the stuff of which great
civilizations have for centuries been made.<p>

<blockquote>

	<font size=5>F</font>INALLY, after nearly ten years of getting in touch with their inner children

and recovering from abuse, millions of consumers of personal-development ideas

have found the perfect parents. Guardian angels watch over all of us,

<img src="Books.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

best-selling books about angels proclaim. Like Superman, they swoop down and

save us from sudden death--lifting us out of the way of oncoming cars or

catching us when we fall off cliffs. Like Mr. Chips, they nurture and inspire

us: "We were given an angel to help us in the creation and writing of this

book," Alma Daniel, Timothy Wyllie, and Andrew Ramer, the authors of <i>Ask

Your Angels</i>, confide, describing angels as the "social workers of the

universe." They give us unsolicited, unconditional love.<p>



Descending from heaven, or wherever, not bound by the mere material world,

angels also give us proof of immortality and the comforting belief that there

is no death, only some sort of energy transformation, which is confirmed by

other best-selling spirituality books. <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/

obidos/ISBN=044651862X/theatlanticmonthA/"><i>The Celestine Prophecy</i></a>, by

 <A HREF="http://www.bookwire.com/BookInfo.Author$55">James

Redfield</A>, assures us that what we imagine as death is a happy transition to a

higher spiritual plane: a new Eden awaits us in the next millennium. Books

about near-death experiences describe the brief sojourns in heaven of people

who died but were sent back to earth by God, or God's minions, to complete

their missions or simply to spread the word: there is no death. Books about

reincarnation promise us many lives before we achieve spiritual perfection and

ascend in the end to--whatever. For Americans who are depressed about the

future of this material world and anxious about violent crime, income

inequality, inadequate health care, war, global warming, or the decline of the

nuclear family, there is incredibly good news about the cosmos.<p>



Publishers of popular spirituality books have already died and gone to heaven.

<i>The Celestine Prophecy</i> recently passed its hundredth week on the <i>New

York Times</i> best-seller list. <i>Embraced by the Light</i>, Betty J. Eadie's

report on her near-death experience, held the No. 1 slot on the <i>New York

Times</i> list for more than thirty weeks. Sales of Sophy Burnham's <i>A</i>

<i>Book of Angels</i> have reached about 750,000. Angel books have sold

millions of copies, as have books about alien abductions. <i>Abduction</i>,

John E. Mack's 1994 account of his interviews with "abductees," and Whitley

Strieber's <i>Communion</i>, a firsthand account of abduction, have been

best-sellers as well. <p>



The abduction stories are not simple anodynes; aliens are a lot scarier and

more aggressive than angels. In some ways they are like the bad parents of

recovery books. Indeed, aliens engage in the worst form of abuse--sexual

molestation. (And abduction stories rely on the reader's belief in

"recovered-memory syndrome," popularized by the recovery movement.) But

extraterrestrial abuse often turns out to be a form of tough love, or at least

a necessity: the aliens are mating with us, creating a hybrid, higher life

form. Although tales of alien abduction generally begin in terror, they end in

enlightenment--the revelation that we are not alone in an indifferent universe.

Usually the aliens want to save us from an impending apocalypse. <p>



Like established religions, mass-market spirituality books often differ

ideologically--some tell us we only live once, while others preach

reincarnation--but they share a general belief in immortality and the presence

of extraterrestrial or celestial beings devoted to our welfare. They share as

well a general disdain for reason, enshrined by the therapeutic culture.

Drawing on popular psychology even more than on religion, experts on angels,

aliens, and life after death traffic in "feeling realities." <A HREF="http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/nova/aliens/johnmack.html">John Mack</A>, a

psychiatrist, writes that he took seriously an alien-abduction story if "what

was being reported was felt to be real by the experiencer . . . and

communicated sincerely" (as if sincerity in these cases might not be simply a

measure of the intensity of delusion). The truth lies in what you feel,

personal-development experts assert, not what you "know in your head," much

less what you can prove. People who have talked to their guardian angels, ET,

or God can only agree. <p>



Spirituality authors, who are generally forgiving of most human foibles (people

aren't bad, only good or less evolved), take a hard line on intellectualism.

Murder they can rationalize: murder victims are spirits who volunteered to be

"part of some other soul's enlightenment test," Marlo Morgan reports in

<i><A HREF="http://www.harpercollins.com/shelves/mutanh.htm">Mutant Message Down Under</A></i>, a best-selling story of spiritual encounters

with aborigines. Skepticism they view with contempt, as the refuge of the

unenlightened. <i>The Celestine Prophecy </i>workbook, a guide to using <i>The

Celestine Prophecy</i>, begins by reminding us that "those who take a strictly

intellectual approach to this subject will be the last to 'get it.'" To change

the world we must "break through the habits of skepticism and denial." <p>



Like virtually all books of its genre, <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i> can

confidently demand that readers suspend their disbelief because it tells so

many people precisely what they want to hear. Its message is that there is no

such thing as a coincidence; there are no chance encounters, no arbitrary

events, no reasons for existential angst. There is only cosmic synchronicity,

to which we become attuned as we evolve spiritually. (The assurance that events

are not random, that we live in a universe ordered by a benign supernatural

being, is repeated in many popular spirituality books.) We have, then, no

reason to worry about the future; it holds the promise of paradise. According

to <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i>, in the future humankind will evolve into a

spiritually enlightened culture of peace and harmony. <p>



In this new Eden critical thinking will be unnecessary. Truth will be

self-evident and accessible to all. People will simply "intuit" the answers to

global problems like pollution, and to individual problems as well. "Guided by

their intuitions, everyone will know precisely what to do and when to do it."

Who would choose the hard work of thinking over the serenity of knowledge bred

in the bone? <p>



So reason is reduced to a mere developmental stage for humankind. <i>The

Celestine Prophecy </i>provides a summary history of the past thousand years.

Born out of the secularization of human culture, science was useful in

providing us with a map of the material world; but it cannot help us to

understand the nonmaterial world of interpersonal energy or the spiritual

questions that confront us as we approach the millennium. As one of the

characters in the book explains, a "particular attitude known as scientific

skepticism . . . served us well with the more obvious phenomena in nature, with

objects such as rocks and bodies and trees, objects everyone can perceive no

matter how skeptical they are." But, she continues, thanks to Einstein we now

know that "the basic stuff of the universe" is "a kind of pure energy that is

malleable to human intention and expectation . . . our expectation itself

causes our energy to flow out into the world and affect other energy systems."

Most scientists simply can't take this notion seriously, she laments.<p>



You can hear in this denigration of science an attempt to appropriate its

credibility, which is typically New Age. (Angel books, for example, talk about

doing scientific research on the existence of angels.) Einstein is on the side

of <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i>, we're told. Most scientists are not

sufficiently evolved to carry on his work. After all, they would not take

seriously the assertion that in the future human beings will be raised "to

higher and higher vibrations." (There is much talk about vibrations in pop

spirituality books; highly evolved people usually vibrate more.) <i>The

Celestine Prophecy</i> reports that as we evolve, vibrating at higher levels,

we become invisible to the less evolved among us. As distilled spiritual

energy, we achieve virtual immortality.<p>



All these insights into the meaning of everything are delivered in what the

flap copy for <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i> calls "a parable filled with vital

truths"--a description bound to lead an unsophisticated reader to believe that

this book is fact, not fiction. It is, however, a dime-novel adventure story

about a man who goes on a quest in Peru to discover an ancient Mayan manuscript

containing the Nine Insights that will save humankind. The story is told in the

first person; the style is testimonial and borrows liberally from popular

notions of spirituality and personal development. <i>Mutant Message Down

Under</i> is equally coy about the veracity of the author's reported adventure

with aborigines: the flap copy labels the book fiction, but in her preface

Morgan claims that it was "inspired by actual experience." She writes, "It is

sold as a novel to protect the small tribe of Aborigines from legal

involvement." In other words, it's a docudrama, which some readers are apt to

consider literally true.<p>



For people who believe in angels, to be sure, believing in <i>The Celestine

Prophecy</i> isn't much of a leap--angel books tell similar truths. According

to <i>A</i> <i>Book of Angels</i> (which started a publishing trend), angels

and other supernatural beings are constantly intervening in our lives. Whatever

we consider coincidence is evidence of the divine. And we can facilitate divine

intervention through prayer: "It is the pleasure of the universe to give us

what we need." This means that mind and spirit are stronger than matter. We can

control events, making wishes and dreams come true. <i>The Celestine

Prophecy</i> makes a similar claim: "When you have acquired enough energy, you

are ready to consciously engage evolution . . . to produce the coincidences

that will lead you forward." Angel books, however, require a little less

initiative: you don't "consciously engage" evolution yourself; you simply ask

your angel.<p>

<br>



<font size=5>T</font>HE appeal of these books is clear. They promise 

us bliss--a world of no evil (only spiritual retardation),&nbsp;fear, loneliness, pain, or death. The

failure to deal with evil is striking. In near-death-experience accounts God,

or the "Being of Light" who greets us when we die, is nonjudgmental. Like a

wise but indulgent parent, He, She, or It smiles ruefully upon us when we

review our sins, knowing that we will do better next time. 

It's easy to sell good news like this, and the authors confidently rely on

classic fallacious arguments. They argue by declaration, which is what makes

the books so amusing. In matter-of-fact, authoritative tones, the authors tell

us how plants and human beings exchange energy--or they describe what angels

look like, whether or how they're sexed, how they communicate with human

beings, and how they differ from ghosts. Readers might be expected to wonder,

How do they know? <p>



What makes fantastic declarations believable is, in part, the vehemence with which

they're proffered. Again, in the world of spirituality as well as of pop

psychology, intensity of personal belief is evidence of truth. It is considered

very bad form--even abuse--to challenge the veracity of any personal testimony

that might be offered in a twelve-step group or on a talk show, unless the

testimony itself is equivocal. Once, I landed on a radio show with a woman who

claimed that she and her family had been abducted and sexually molested by

aliens. When I said that it might be difficult for some people to accept her

tale at face value, she angrily offered as evidence of her encounters bodily

markings, memories, and (in a stab at empiricism) "metallurgically flattened

shrubbery" outside her house. I told her that I was sorry for her trouble.

Sometimes I, too, feel as if I'm sleeping with an extraterrestrial.



Ubiquity of belief is also offered as evidence of truth. <i>Ask Your Angels</i>

asserts that the references to angels in popular culture--in songs such as

"Teen Angel" and "Johnny Angel," and in movies such as <i>It's a Wonderful

Life</i> and <i>Heaven Knows</i>,<i> Mr. Allison</i>--constitute evidence that

angels exist, as do the popularity of angel books and the willingness of the

industry to publish them. Whatever sells, whatever many people believe

strongly, must be true. There are, however, exceptions to this reliance on

feelings as evidence of truth: if, for instance, your feelings lead to

disbelief instead of belief, they're apt to be dismissed as some form of

denial. This is not a common problem. Usually intellectualism, not "feeling

reality," is blamed for disbelief. But, some angel experts suggest, there may

be emotional as well as intellectual barriers to belief: unwillingness to

believe in angels can reflect low self-esteem. <p>



These are perfectly closed belief systems; the possibility of error is never

considered. If you don't see angels, or energy fields emanating from your

rhododendron, you simply don't know how to look for them. The possibility that

some people who believe that they commune with angels or ghosts or enjoy

mystical out-of-body experiences may be hallucinating is given little credence.

Like detective stories, spirituality books usually discard the most plausible

explanations and adopt the most implausible ones for the mysteries they

encounter. Rational, alternative explanations for a belief don't, after all,

assume the truth of whatever is believed.<p>



All these styles of argument--arguing by declaration, arguing from intensity

and ubiquity of belief, and arguing from a conclusion--are routinely employed

by personal-development experts, including codependency gurus and a range of

inspirational and motivational speakers. So it is easy for readers to switch

from one belief system to another--to turn from codependency books to books

about angels. <p>



In fact, authors and publishers expect that many of these books will share an

audience, and they offer similar solace. They present solutions to both global

and individual problems: focusing on personal spiritual evolution and the

evolution of humankind, they're not above giving advice about how to get a

better job. Norman Vincent Peale's best seller <i>The Power of Positive

Thinking</i> has the same preoccupation with the metaphysical and the trivial:

it will cure existential anxiety and improve one's golf game. Virtually all

personal-development and spirituality books partake of the positive-thinking

tradition, which pre-dated Peale by at least a hundred years. They also

cross-reference one another. <i>Ask Your Angels</i>, for example, includes a

twelve-step angel program. <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i> talks about

codependency, and <i>The Celestine Prophecy </i>workbook cites the best-selling

alternative-medicine guru Deepak Chopra. <p>



These books offer membership in a spiritual elite. Indeed, the authors tend to

see themselves as messiahs, chosen by aliens, angels, or various "Beings of

Light" to help save the world. (People who claim to have been abducted by

aliens often observe that they have always felt "special" and now know that

their alienation was literal.) But a spiritual encounter isn't necessary to

join the elite; merely reading these books and being open to their messages is

cited as a means to enlightenment. <p>



Belief systems like this demand very little of us. A good attitude substitutes

for good works. Self-absorption may be a spiritual imperative.

Nineteenth-century revivalists, late-twentieth-century recovery-movement

experts, and an expert on spirituality like James Redfield tell us that by

working on our own religious, psychological, or spiritual evolution, we are

working on the world. "Your own willingness to take time to study <i>The

Celestine Prophecy</i> is part of the evolutionary process," Redfield writes.

"<i>The amount of consciousness you bring to the collective mind is part of

your contribution</i>." <p>



Activity is not required; in this world there is no such thing as a sin of

omission. Popular spirituality books involve even less self-help than popular

psychology, with its exaltation of experts; instead of working through the

twelve steps or any other technique, you can now wait for angelic intervention.

But what is perhaps even more troubling than the childlike passivity encouraged

by these books is their denigration of skepticism and their encouragement of

habits of unreason, which carry over into political and work and home life. The

elevation of personal truths and personal testimony over logic and verifiable

fact which links popular psychology and popular spirituality today also infects

other kinds of belief.<p>



Consider the militia movement, which invests the New World Order with demonic

power. Propaganda of the extreme right (like propaganda of the extreme left

twenty-five years ago) employs the same techniques of argument found in popular

spirituality books. Propagandists argue by declaration, relying on intensity

and relative ubiquity of belief. (Genuinely ubiquitous beliefs, however, lose

the power of cultism: if the participation of some people in the belief system

provides a reality test and a source of solidarity, the participation of many

people makes the system less special.) <p>



There are also clear analogies between the denial of coincidence that's central

to popular spirituality literature and the embrace of conspiracy theories. If

angel books reflect the need to believe in omnipotent, absolute good, extremist

political groups reflect the need to believe in omnipotent evil--in the form of

the U.S. government or the New World Order. There are virtually no political

accidents in the view of a conspiracy theorist; whatever happens happens for a

reason, generally the worst. <p>



It's not surprising, then, to find crossovers from New Age beliefs to the

militias. I know a convert to the militia movement who was once deeply enmeshed

in the Church of Scientology and remains an avid believer in the paranormal.

She has always thrived on the presence of enemies, and so, in a way, do popular

spirituality authors. Even if there is no evil in the benevolent universe they

depict, only unenlightenment, there are still enemies: notably science,

rationalism, and established religion, which is almost always distinguished

from spirituality as doctrine rather than feeling. (In <i>The Celestine

Prophecy</i> the primary villains are not scientists but priests.) Despite

their majoritarian appeal, mass-market spirituality books offer the pleasures

of membership in a besieged minority. Like extremist political movements, they

shine with moral vanity.

Edelin kill a person at Boston City Hospital? Can otherdoctors be convicted of manslaughter in the deaths of fetuses they abort, asEdelin was?<p><p><p>There are no commonly accepted medical or legal standards to define a humanbeing. Edelin's manslaughter trial early this year hinged on that definitionand on a cluster of related questions about the limits of human life andmedical responsibility. They are questions that will grow in urgency as doctorsbecome more skilled in sustaining life before an infant can function foritself, or after an old or sick person loses his capacity to function.<p><p><p>"A fetus is not a person and not the subject of an indictment formanslaughter," Boston's Superior Court Judge James P. McGuire told the jury.<p><p><p>Yet twelve men and women found Edelin guilty on February 15 of homicide in thedeath of a twenty- to twenty-four-week-old fetus during the course of a legalabortion.<p><p><p>Their verdict left doctors and lawyers debating over just what it was Edelinhad killed. Under the judge's instructions it had to have been something morethan a fetus. If so, at what point did the fetus become a person protected bylaw? To stay on the safe side of that question, a number of hospitals aroundthe country have now cut back on abortions performed after the third month ofpregnancy.<p><p><p>In reaching their decision, the jurors appear to have ignored many of the legaland medical points raised about the scope of an abortion, the moment of birth,and the ability of a fetus to survive on its own. And they left behind themquestions about whether a jury of laymen can be asked to decide a case whoseoutcome rests on technical questions and disputes over definitions.<p><p><p>"I don't believe it's possible for a jury of people like those who wereselected to really understand the issues, especially some of the scientific andmedical problems encountered at the trial," Edelin said later. "We attempted toeducate them, and I guess we failed. As a jury of my peers...it certainly wasnot."<p><p><p>The jurors themselves said they were most impressed by a photograph of thefetus, which they said "looked like a baby," and by the prosecutor's insistencethat the aborted fetus was due all the attention a baby would receive.<p><p><p>"That baby should have had the chance to prove his own viability," said jurorPaul A. Holland. "There is only one person that can make that decision, andthat is the baby....We did not agree that [Edelin] took the proper precautionsin checking the baby."<p><p><p>Although the verdict may have appeared to run counter to much of the testimony,it did make a statement that doctors and lawyers must now take into account. Itmade a statement about the attitudes of twelve ordinary people toward thepotential person involved in an abortion, and about the duty a doctor owesit.<p><p><p>Edelin, thirty-six, is coordinator of ambulatory services in the obstetricaland gynecological ward of Boston City Hospital, where many of the patients areblack and poor. At the time of the abortion, he was chief resident in thedepartment, one of only two residents who routinely performed abortions.Although he does not like to perform them, he says, he believes strongly thathe has an obligation to provide the best medical care to a woman, whether shewishes to give birth or terminate her pregnancy.<p><p><p>"I will continue to do abortions. They are a woman's right," he said after hisconviction, "Women since they've been on this earth have been making thatchoice, whether they want to carry that baby or not....The only humane thing wecan do is make sure that when they make that choice they have the opportunityto make it under the best conditions possible."<p><p><p>On October 3, 1973, Edelin performed a legal abortion at the request of apregnant seventeen year-old, completing the operation by hysterotomy ormini-Cesarean, after three attempts at saline infusion failed. In thehysterotomy, he removed the fetus through an incision in its mother's abdomenpeeling it from the wall of the womb and scooping it out along with theafterbirth.<p><p><p>Two months later, investigators from the Suffolk County district attorney'soffice found the fetus in the hospital's morgue as they gathered evidence foranother indictment against four physicians performing research on the tissuesof aborted fetuses. That prosecution, based on an 1814 grave-robbing statute,is next on Assistant District Attorney Flanagan's docket.<p><p><p>When Edelin's case came to trial in January, Flanagan argued that although theabortion was legal, the death of the fetus was not; that the abortion wascompleted the moment the fetus was separated from the wall of the womb, andthat at that moment a baby was born "with all the rights that you have underthe Constitution of the United States."<p><p><p>Defense Attorney Homans called this reasoning "metaphysical." He argued thatthe entire operation, including the death of the fetus, was protected by theU.S. Supreme Court's decision legalizing most abortions. In any event, he said,the fetus never was born and never legally became a person.<p><p><p>The conviction of Dr. Edelin, despite that defense, opens the possibility thatany doctor maybe convicted of homicide in the death of a legally abortedfetus--particularly in late abortions and those performed by hysterotomy, whichrun the risk of producing a fetus that shows at least fleeting signs of life.<p><p><p>The trial raised sensitive questions skirted by the companion Supreme Courtrulings of January 1973, known as "Roe and Doe." In those rulings, the courtbarred states from interfering with a woman's right to an abortion before afetus became viable--but left the moment and definition of viability unclear.And the trial reopened debate about the status of persons on the fringes oflife, either side of the moment of birth or death.<p><p><p>"If the obstetrician has the right to destroy the live-born infant in anabortion procedure, would he not have the same right to extinguish the life ofa newborn infant with a congenital defect whose mother may not want him?" askedDr. Matthew J. Bulfin of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, president of the AmericanAssociation of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists "The acceptance of thisprinciple surely would in fact be providing legal endorsement for euthanasia.<p><p><p>As this debate was brought into the courtroom, with separate sets of medicalexperts testifying for the prosecution and defense, the jurors found themselvesconfronted with at least two conflicting opinions on almost every pointraised.<p><p><p>In Roe and Doe, the court said a fetus is generally considered viable at abouttwenty-eight weeks' gestational age, but that viability sometimes comes asearly as twenty-four weeks. It drew its estimates from generally acceptedmedical practice. But the authors of two basic obstetrical textbooks, on whichmuch of this practice is based, testified at the trial to their own uncertaintyabout the age at which a fetus can survive. They and other doctors also pointedout that "survival" itself is a disputed concept: does it mean life for aminute, for twenty-eight days, or for a lifetime of contribution to society?<p><p><p>Flanagan capitalized on their uncertainty, asking each one whether thedetermination of viability should not be left up to the fetus itself, no matterhow statistically tiny its chance. The doctor's role, he said, is simply togive it the best medical care as it struggles for life.<p><p><p>Roe and Doe also did not specifically define abortion, leaving another openquestion whose answer could affect Edelin's fate. If abortions presuppose thedeath of the fetus, as Edelin claimed, then his entire procedure was legal andimmune from prosecution. But Flanagan's medical experts insisted that anabortion was nothing more than the termination of pregnancy, which couldsometimes result in a live birth.<p><p><p>The definition of birth itself became pivotal as witnesses raised questions offact about the procedure Edelin used and the exact moment the fetus died,Doctors testifying against him agreed that birth means the separation of theplacenta from the wall of the womb, the moment at which the fetus "goes on itsown systems" for nourishment and oxygen. Defense witnesses repeated the morecommonly understood definition of the word as involving expulsion or removalfrom the mother's body. And Judge McGuire supported that understanding of theword in his charge to the jury.<p><p><p>The distinction was crucial, for Edelin was accused of killing the abortedfetus before removing it from inside its mother. Flanagan charged that he heldit motionless inside the womb and watched a wall clock for three minutes as itstruggled for air and died. Edelin, supported by testimony from two nurses anda medical student, denied the three-minute wait, and claimed that in fact therewas no working wall clock for him to watch. But he did not deny that he had nointention of delivering a live baby: "It would have been contrary to the wishesof the mother."<p><p><p>Although Flanagan's only eyewitness had testified emphatically that "the babywas dead" when Edelin finally removed it, the prosecutor brought otherwitnesses who claimed it had breathed outside its mother. On the basis of theirexamination of its lungs, a medical examiner and a pathologist testified thatthe fetus could have drawn breath outside its mother.<p><p><p>But witnesses for the defense looked at the same slides of lung tissue andinsisted that no air had been breathed, that the lungs showed signs of gaspswithin the uterus but not outside it. One of these witnesses even suggestedthat the gasps had come during the earlier attempts at saline infusion, andthat the fetus had died at that time--before the hysterotomy began.<p><p><p>In the face of the series of contradictory testimony throughout the trial, thejury's verdict appeared to fall short of the "moral certainty beyond areasonable doubt" that Judge McGuire said was called for. The verdict appearedto be based on a series of possibilities: that the fetus might have been aperson, might have been viable, might have been born, might have breathedoutside its mother.<p><p><p>But it did appear to reflect a certainty that neither the legal rights of thesurgeon nor the wishes of the mother were enough to deny the fetus a chance forlife. The jury's decision, based on a photograph that "looked like a baby,"appeared to state that as long as there was a reasonable doubt that this wasnot a person, it must be treated with every care a person would receive.<p><p><p>Edelin talked later about the hard decisions every doctor must make, thebalancing he must do between the needs of the mother and the aborted fetus,between those of the fetus and a premature infant who may need attention.<p><p><p>There is likely to be an increasing number of these hard decisions asartificial placentas, or test tube babies, are developed, and as doctors learnto keep alive the old and sick.<p><p><p>The decisions are currently being made in a legal vacuum, and the trial ofKenneth Edelin served to point out some of the questions that need to beanswered.<p></blockquote><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1975 by Seth Mydans.

<blockquote>


<font size=5>A</font><font size=3>t some stage every
major museum of twentieth-century art has had to reconcile its duty
to the past with its need to be of the moment. New York's Whitney Museum of
American Art has always seemed more troubled by this task than most. It was
originally founded by the heiress Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, in 1914, as a
studio club with an admirably populist mandate: to promote American art and
provide a gathering place for American artists, at a time when both were pretty
much regarded as Europe's embarrassingly tatty country cousins--that is, when
anyone bothered to look. The museum proper opened in 1931, to house Whitney's
own collection of American art after the Metropolitan Museum summarily rejected
it. Today the Whitney's holdings make up the world's pre-eminent collection of
twentieth-century American art. The museum also remains actively caught up in
New York's downtown gallery world--by now a fashion-conscious, moneyed,
internationally influential scene that helps keep the museum controversial.<p>

<A HREF="./musind.htm"><img src="../../../images/shorsera.gif" align=left

</A>


In the 1980s the Whitney raised critical eyebrows by leaving off regular
displays of the permanent collection for large mid-career retrospectives of
such art stars as Cindy Sherman and David Salle, whose work its trustees were
also acquiring--arguably the art-world equivalent of insider trading. Under a
new director, David Ross, in the 1990s, the museum has often seemed bedeviled
by a current bugaboo--the ceaseless search for a relevant spin. Who can forget
the museum's politically correct 1993 biennial, whose artists alerted
gallery-goers to the evils of sexism, racism, capitalism, traditional
aesthetics, and child abuse? Who wants to remember the mind-numbing wall texts
and hipper-than-thou video displays that have so often attended historical
work, the better to recontextualize it? The museum's latest tack has been a
kind of sexy globality: parts of the permanent collection will soon travel to
Prague, where Eastern bloc creative types can commune with them; and <A HREF="http://www.echonyc.com/~whitney/">the
museum's site on the World Wide Web</A> allows anyone anywhere with a jazzy enough
computer to access Edward Hopper and Georgia O'Keeffe.<p>
Unfortunately, this relentless trend-mongering undercuts the fact that many of
the Whitney's ideas are good ones--precisely the sort that the behemoth it has
become must try if it is to remain anywhere near the cutting edge. Yet the
museum's mission is also to talk about America to America, a task that is
increasingly fraught with danger for anyone who tries it. And it's doubly tough
to sound convincing about Peoria when one speaks with the forked tongue of
today's academe--in other words, when one's vocabulary is restricted to
artspeak.<p>
Strangely enough, learning to communicate with Peoria--or a West Coast
facsimile--is precisely what the Whitney has done. In 1992 it entered into an
agreement with the San Jose Museum of Art, in California's Silicon Valley, to
provide enough work--about four percent of its collection, all told--to fill
four eighteen-month-long shows in exchange for about $4.4 million.<p>
The idea of collection-sharing, as the art world calls it, on a long-term basis
between two independent museums is new, and therefore controversial. Those who
are against it say that collections shouldn't be farmed out at all, and
certainly not for profit; those who are in favor point out that museums make
short-term exchanges of art and exact touring fees all the time--and usually
keep nearly all of their holdings in storage. As Stephen Weil, the deputy
director of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, in Washington, D.C., has
pointed out, much of the country's art is held east of the Mississippi whereas
population centers are moving west, and thus collection-sharing seems like an
idea whose time has come. For New Yorkers, that may not ease the pain of seeing
works so closely associated with the city shipped off to what might as well be
Podunk. (It must have rubbed salt in the wound when Josi Callan, the director
of the San Jose museum, ballyhooed the deal as a "world-class collection"
coming to a "world-class building.")<p>
None of this had much to do with why I wanted to see the Whitney art in its
temporary home, however. I grew up twenty minutes from San Jose. From the
perspective of the Stanford campus, where I was raised, San Jose is an area
looming at the other end of Silicon Valley--an endless cheesy vista of shopping
malls, multiplexes, housing developments, and mirror-eyed convention centers.
San Jose's local reputation is so glum, in fact, that for years I prided myself
on never having been there. But I knew the area to be pragmatic, progressive,
and creative--high tech flourished there--and I was curious to see how those
characteristics might be applied to presenting American art. The experiment I
found seems oddly in keeping with the Whitney's populist roots.<p>

<font size=5>T</font><font size=3>he first show, which opened in May of last year, was surprisingly
straightforward. "A History Reconsidered," it was called: a few more than a
hundred works, mostly on canvas and paper, marshaled in a survey of <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/wm/paint/tl/20th/pre-war.html">artistic
movements from 1900 to 1940</A>. In terms of the Whitney's collection, that meant
works by artists who were striving to define a visual vernacular--a look that
would cry "America" loud and clear at a time when it appeared that there was
only Europe to react to. The artists included coteries like the Ashcan School,
painters devoted to realism and the depiction of urban life; the Regionalists,
who settled on the beau ideal of the midwestern rural scene; and the
Precisionists, whose geometric aesthetic was inspired by American architecture
and machinery. The show was chockablock with paintings that, however
outr&eacute; they may have looked in their time, are today familiar, and in
some places worn, icons: Georgia O'Keeffe's <i>The White Calico Flower</i>,
Charles Sheeler's <i>River Rouge Plant</i>, <A HREF="http://mosaic.echonyc.com/~whitney/WMAA/HOPPER/tophop.html">Edward Hopper's <i>Railroad
Sunset</i></A>. Yet the viewers seemed to be regarding everything with equal
attention, from lithographs to pencil sketches, holding companions back to look
at things they might have missed, and commenting on wall texts to strangers.
Even the guards seemed excited to have the art there. One of them planted
himself in front of George Bellows's <i>Dempsey and Firpo</i> and held forth,
at some length, about the original fight.<p>
What made this show work so well? Thinking back, and revisiting the show, as I
have done often, I came up with several answers. First, it was simply a joy to
see the Whitney art itself, which has not appeared so representatively in
years. (The Whitney plans to return a similarly extensive portion of the
collection to permanent display.) Second, because San Jose's galleries are
relatively small, it was easy to grasp the back and forth between realism and
abstraction, regionalism and urbanism, and to observe the ceaseless tussle
between Europe and whatever other influences presented themselves. Third, it
was enlightening to see work so closely associated with the East and the
Midwest somewhere else. As I looked at Charles Demuth's <i>My Egypt</i>, which
makes of a geometrically rendered set of grain elevators a looming cultural
icon, my mind leaped naturally to Silicon Valley's own recent transformation
from orchard to office park. Regarding a pencil sketch of a New York scene
complete with crowds and straphangers, I realized that the valley's main
industry--high tech--is on its way to rendering such familiar sights obsolete.
A work like Max Weber's <i>Chinese Restaurant</i>--a Cubist rendition of a New
York eatery painted by a Russian Jew who had studied painting in Paris--looked
different in a museum where a stand by the exhibition entrance offers brochures
in English, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese.<p>
<font size=5>F</font><font size=3>inally, there were the wall texts. This being <A HREF="http://mosaic.echonyc.com/~whitney/WMAA/LIBRARY/WHIS.html">the Whitney collection</A>, I
expected them to be something I'd have to ignore: long-winded recitations about
my need to revise my notions of the aspects of America I was being shown, or
else dispiriting reminders that the collection itself is suspect, founded as it
was in part upon the grossly capitalistic excrescence of Cornelius Vanderbilt's
nineteenth-century shipping fortune--Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney's inheritance.
Instead the curators simply posed the following questions at the show's start:
What is a masterpiece? What is American about American art? Why have some media
(namely, oil paintings and sculpture) been more highly valued than others--and
why did that hierarchy have to change in order for art to develop in this
country? The usual revisionist stance had somehow been refined to its most
intelligent essence, so that it was actually useful. How had this happened?<p>
The answer was something I didn't begin to figure out until, on my first visit,
I left the museum and started wandering around the huge park beside it. It was
Christmastime. The grass of the plaza was thick with plastic snow. On it sat a
garish display of decorated trees and animated dioramas of the
Santa-in-his-teddy-bear-factory variety. Each tree bore the name of a
sponsoring community group --everything from a Buddhist Scout troop and a
university frat house to the DAR, a gay and lesbian center, a Vietnam veterans'
society, and a Filipino community club. Anglo and Latino couples strolled among
the trees. There were plenty of toddlers and babies. There were even a couple
of leather-clad bikers, cruising their hogs slowly around the edge. At one end,
right by the museum, a huge mechanical Christmas tree creaked  up and down, out
of and into a gargantuan gift box. It was a glorious and awful sight. It was
also the postmodern, "post-colonial" world that the Whitney, in its wall texts
and catalogues, often seems to be maundering on about. Except here it just
looked like real life.<p>
<font size=5><A HREF="http://www.sj-sharks.com/community/community.html">S</font><font size=3>an Jose</A> is that wonder in these times--an American city that sees its civic
future as bound to the growth of its arts and cultural institutions. Over the
past thirteen years its redevelopment agency has devotedly funneled more than a
billion property-tax dollars into the museum, the symphony, and the city's
repertory theater, along with such other quality-of-life and infrastructure
projects as a hockey-and-performance arena and a streetcar system. The aim is
to rejuvenate the downtown and boost the city's national profile, so that San
Jose will look more like what it is: the eleventh largest city in the United
States (far ahead of Boston and Seattle) and the third largest in California
(behind Los Angeles and San Diego).<p>
The fledgling art scene is considered so important, in fact, that Susan Hammer,
the mayor, attends benefits and press conferences for the museum, and she
readily cleared time to talk to me. "My dream is to have this be the cultural
center of northern California," Hammer told me, and because she entered public
life in 1969 by helping to found the community art museum about which I was
interviewing her now, I was tempted to believe her. (Another reason was her
straight-shooting, no-nonsense, tennis-tanned manner, which put me in mind of
the terrifyingly efficient moms who used to shove us kids into the back of a
wood-paneled Country Squire and haul us around to improving activities.) "When
you look at history down through the ages, the societies that have survived
have been the ones that have had a real commitment to arts and culture. And on
less philosophical terms, the arts are an economic power."<p>
One more thing. Hammer said, "We understand each other better through the arts
if we learn about each other's culture and holidays and celebrations and
paintings. And I like to think that through that understanding we're better
able to live in harmony with each other." San Jose, with its dwindling Anglo
population and rapidly growing Hispanic and Asian segments, is fast becoming a
smaller-scale version of the minority-ruled California that has for so long
been predicted. It also remains, like the rest of the Bay Area, staunchly
liberal. Local arts organizations see the words "Engage thy community" writ
large. <p>
So when Josi Callan, the director of the museum, hears visitors say, "I don't
get it," or "My kid could do that," or even "I don't like it," she can't shrug
off these people as philistines. (Nor can she, in this predominantly Democratic
part of the world, dismiss them as "neoconservatives"--as so many people are
wont to do, now that the arts have become a political football.) She has what
amounts to a civic mandate to pay attention.<p>
Her genius for paying attention is the reason that Callan, who has no
curatorial background, ended up as the museum's director. A previous head had
decamped precipitately, leaving the museum with a beautiful new wing but a
reputation for being a hangout for art groupies. When Callan, then the museum's
associate director, was drafted for the job, she refocused the museum's mission
toward serving a broader arts community. Concert and lecture series were
organized. In collaboration with The Mexican Museum, in San Francisco, she
commissioned the Los Angeles artist Gronk to create a temporary installation,
and waived admission so that any passerby could come in and watch him paint on
the gallery walls. The curatorial staff began testing wall texts and brochures
on schoolchildren, journalists, and many other people, and then had the results
printed in different languages. Callan set up a committee to brainstorm on how
to attract members of different ethnic groups and also, the committee head told
me, teachers, bankers, and all those engineers and entrepreneurs in their
far-flung R&amp;D buildings. (The museum provides most of the area's public
school art education, but some of the engineers are still proving tough nuts to
crack.) <p>
Important as this work was, none of it solved what Callan saw as the basic
problem: much of the prospective audience had never set foot in a museum. And
contemporary art--all that the museum is ever likely to be able to show or
collect--has a reputation for being intimidating, even to regular museumgoers.
Callan's response was to say, "We haven't done a good job of educating our
community." How to do it? The museum's own collection, like that of many
community museums, was relatively negligible at the time. In the end there
seemed to be only one solution: go out and bring in someone else's, and use it
to teach the history of modern art.<p>
<font size=5>N</font><font size=3>aturally, the Whitney-San Jose agreement didn't fall together quite as simply
as that. The deal was hammered out with the help of the San Jose Redevelopment
Agency, which wanted a large impact and was willing to contribute $3 million of
the fee to make one, and David Resnicow, a New York museum consultant who had
conducted a brief test run of a similar project in Miami. Resnicow had
originally spoken on behalf of the redevelopment agency to four major U.S.
museums, including the Whitney. It was David Ross, at the Whitney, who got the
idea right away and was flexible enough to see the deal through, working with
Callan. Of the roughly 11,000 pieces in the Whitney collection, more than 98
percent were in storage, and Ross was disturbed at being unable to show more.
What made the experiment work so well is that Callan and Ross both felt that it
made sense for the two museums to collaborate on presentation, rather than
having the San Jose show be run as a Whitney franchise.<p>
 
Although both Ross and Callan assured me that they had forged "a real
partnership," Callan was quick to acknowledge that, as in any close
collaboration, there had been plenty of bumps along the way. What these might
have been is perhaps best imagined by looking at the two directors. In one
corner sits Ross, with his brushed-back gray hair, his chic little clear-framed
glasses, and a Laurie Anderson CD-ROM on his desk; in the other is Callan, with
a perky blonde bob and a needlepoint sign above her office door: "UNTIL 
MORALE IMPROVES / FLOGGING WILL CONTINUE." They're both charming, intense, and
voluble, but where Ross tends toward futuristic riffs (Silicon Valley is "the
new economic engine for this nation!" "By the year 2025 you've got one city
that essentially goes from Los Angeles to San Francisco!" "Do you have access
to the World Wide Web?"), Callan is likely to wave a fist in the air and
proclaim, "The kind of product we were delivering was not addressing changing
museum demographics!" <p>
Each of them represents one side of a coin that is often regarded as
counterfeit in the larger art world: Callan is fund-raiser and administrator
become museum head; Ross is museum head turned hypemeister. It seems
astonishing that their two institutions should have finally settled on a
relatively traditional art exhibit that nonetheless manages to explain its
subject to the public from the creators' points of view, rather than the
curators'. <p>
"One of our basic philosophies is to do art history on the wall," says Peter
Gordon, San Jose's chief curator. "It's kind of like a freshman course in
American art but using the real stuff instead of slides. If people take
advantage of it and come and look at the work and read the labels, they start
to know the basic building blocks of looking at art in this century. At least
in this country."<p>
The second collaborative show, opening next month, will cover 1940 to 1965, the
period during which American abstraction took off, culminating in such works as
the all-black canvases that have left so many feeling they've admired the
Emperor's new clothes. "Typically what you hear is that people generally don't
like abstract shows, or they just don't feel comfortable with them," says
Dianne Hoover, the San Jose museum's assistant curator. "So we've been keeping
that in mind as we think about how to organize this next show and really try to
make the work accessible." Together with Beth Venn, the associate curator for
the Whitney's permanent collection, Hoover is working on a display that will,
like the first show, move chronologically through its period, suggesting how
three traditions--the landscape, the portrait, and the still life--were being
continued, adapted, or overthrown. "It's really a new way of approaching the
work," she told me with enthusiasm.<p>
<font size=5>S</font><font size=3>ince the Whitney art arrived, the San Jose museum's attendance has increased
by about a third. The museum has received a substantial boost on the funding
front--with major grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the
Knight Foundation, and an upsurge of interest from local companies--and also
several strong donations of art to its own permanent collection. Interestingly,
the museum's adjunct shows are now pulling almost as strongly. Many of these
have a local angle. "The View From Within" displayed art made during the Second
World War in Japanese-American internment camps, many survivors of which still
live in the area. A stunning retrospective of Andy Goldsworthy, a British
artist, revealed the use of Bay Area manzanita wood, clay, and slate in the
artist's "nature collaborations." Upcoming shows will present work from the
high-tech visionary Nam June Paik, and from Vietnamese and Vietnamese-American
artists. And "La Frontera/The Border," which presented several aspects of the
U.S.-Mexico "border experience," went up at around the same time that the
referendum on Proposition 187, California's 1994 anti-illegal-alien initiative,
took place, allowing the museum to combine the exhibition with a bilingual
writing contest and a highly charged political debate.<p>
I hated this last show; I thought that much of it should have been packed
straight off to whatever dumping bin holds that ghastly 1993 Whitney biennial.
But that's also why I liked it. By gearing its own shows so patently to local
passions, the museum can speak directly to visitors about the response to a
political situation, a painting, a face, a rock, an electron, or an idea which
may lead someone to create art. And then these visitors, by walking through the
Whitney show, can experience a range of creative, aesthetic, and technical
decisions that others used to resolve such impulses. When the present moment is
considered in the context of the past, rather than vice versa, it starts to
look like what it truly is: another blip on the ever-flickering screen of
artistic exploration. <p>
The Whitney, meanwhile, seems to have been refreshed by the need to rethink its
past for a new audience--an audience that has been encouraged to view the
collection appreciatively rather than revisionistically. One of its own shows
this past summer was drawn from the permanent collection, and two others in
particular managed to sidestep the sort of critical issues that often obsess
the professional art world and tap straight into the lust for creativity that
still draws artists and art lovers to New York. A delectable retrospective of
the work of Florine Stettheimer, who was active when the Whitney was a club,
put her fey, idiosyncratic depictions of turn-of-the-century personalities on
public view together for the first time in fifty years. A Hopper show presented
a small selection of the painter's work rather than an exhaustive array, and
the paintings were accompanied, somewhat astonishingly, by lines of poetry on
the walls rather than by reams of Marxist critique. Though many critics caviled
at the show's video display and the lack of scholarly apparatus, some
appreciated its modest scale--and none could really argue with the crowds that
ceaselessly thronged it. The Whitney, whose instinct for the moment is helping
to make the San Jose experiment work so well, may also be bringing some of that
younger museum's grassroots savvy home as it reintroduces its past to New York.
