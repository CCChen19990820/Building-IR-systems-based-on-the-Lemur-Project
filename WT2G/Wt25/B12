<P>Nearly every community offers scholarship help to its young citizens. The
grants can vary in size  from one hundred dollars to several thousand. Community
awards are usually circumscribed in their  geographic coverage and you must
learn about them yourself. There is no central registry. Read the  local
newspaper carefully, especially the page devoted to club and community affairs.
Visit the  Chamber of Commerce. It might keep track of business and corporate
scholarships offered in your  area. Also visit the American Legion Post. The
legionnaires take a special interest in helping people  with their education.
And finally, ask your high school counselor! Here are some examples:</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Your City</STRONG><BR> Examples: Students who graduate from the
Cleveland Public Schools can earn $1000 for their first  year of college if they
meet the following benchmarks: Pass a set of proficiency exams in 8th grade; 
enroll in core curriculum courses throughout their four years of high school;
maintain at least a 2.5  GPA; earn at least a 16 on the ACT (or a combined
math/verbal SAT score of 740); and  matriculate into a Pell Grant eligible
school. To learn more about starting this program in your city  (or high
school), write, <EM>Gateway to Excellence</EM>, Cleveland Initiative for
Education, 2000 E. 9th  Street., #808, Cleveland, OH 44115.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Your Community</STRONG><BR> Look for scholarship bulletins from civic
associations, businesses, PTA chapters, social and  professional clubs,
fraternal organizations, patriotic and veterans organizations. Some communities 
do very well by their students. For example, journalist Carl Rowan founded &quot;Project
Excellence,&quot; a  program that gives scholarships to some of the Washington
DC area's brightest African-American  students. This year Mr. Rowan raised
nearly $4 million and awarded 108 scholarships (ranging  from $4,000 to
$60,000). In addition to private donors in your community, you should look
toward  larger local foundations. There are nearly 400 community funds
nationwide which award nearly  $100 million to education projects annually!</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Your High School</STRONG><BR> Many high schools have established
information clearing houses to work in conjunction with the  guidance office.
Students (and their parents) may attend workshops on college financing; they 
receive individual assistance on filing aid applications; they have access to
current financial aid  literature; and in some instances, they can tap into
computerized scholarship data bases. ALL FOR  FREE! Some schools have even
created foundations to provide &quot;last dollar scholarships&quot; for 
students with exceptional financial need. Examples: The Scholarship Fund of
Alexandria (VA), I  Know I Can, Columbus (OH), and California Community
Foundation, Los Angeles (CA). </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>I Have A Dream</STRONG><BR> Over a decade ago, the very wealthy Eugene
Lang promised college scholarships (and extra  counseling) to an entire 6th
grade class at his former elementary school in East Harlem. In 1986, he  created
the I Have A Dream Foundation to help other people start similar projects.
Reviews have  been mixed. Many sponsors have had great success getting at-risk
students through HS and into  college. Others have found that money alone isn't
enough to compensate for missing parents,  missing discipline, missing
expectations and missing hope. They've learned that a successful program  also
requires a significant number of volunteers to keep the Dreamers on track.
Today, about  10,000 students benefit from over 140 &quot;I Have A Dream&quot;
projects in 41 cities across the country.  Unfortunately, needy students can't
apply directly for this assistance; they can only hope someone  will adopt their
class (and at a minimum investment of $300,000/class, benefactors are hard to
find). </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Corporate Generosity</STRONG><BR> It's still too early to tell whether
&quot;I Have a Dream&quot; has been effective, but corporate America is  jumping
on the bandwagon...witness &quot;The Pepsi Challenge&quot; in which the
soft-drink company  provided college scholarship money for &quot;at-risk&quot;
students at selected high schools in Detroit and  Dallas who met certain GPA and
attendance requirements. Similarly, <EM>The Washington Post</EM> gives 
students at Eastern High School in Washington DC $500 for college for each
semester they get all  A's and B's. More than 100 Post staffers now serve as
mentors and more than 30 colleges and  universities now offer matching grants.
For more information on establishing student incentive  programs like The
Eastern High School 500 Club, please call Dr. Vincent Reed at (202)  334-6834.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Dollars for Scholars</STRONG><BR> Dollars for Scholars chapters are
community-based, volunteer-operated scholarship foundations  affiliated with the
<EM>Citizen's Scholarship Foundation of America, Inc</EM>. (CSFA) Dollars for 
Scholars chapters provide financial assistance, academic support programs, and
community support  for students seeking postsecondary education. CSFA provides
nonprofit status, guidelines and  materials for chapter operations. All funds
raised locally are distributed by a local awards committee  to students of the
community. Ask your counselor if your community has a Dollars for Scholars 
chapter. If not, and you'd like to start one, contact: Dollars for Scholars, PO
Box 297, St. Peter,  MN 56082, 800-248-8080.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Community Service Programs</STRONG><BR> The Corporation for National
Service wants to continue funding about 20,000 AmeriCorps  positions this year,
but even if Congressional critics succeed in eliminating this highly and widely 
praised public service program (see <A HREF="ch10.html">Chapter 10</A>), there
will still be opportunities available via your  home state or a local agency.
These 80+ state and local organizations spend over $131 million  annually on
conservation and youth-service corps and enable 30,000 additional volunteers to
be  rewarded for work on education, environmental and public safety programs.
While each community  is free to run its own program, there are several common
threads. In general, corps members work  on projects in teams made up of 5-10
people from a wide variety of backgrounds (this racial,  ethnic, and economic
diversity is at the heart of most programs-everyone benefits from the 
experiences and perspectives of their fellow participants). In exchange for
service, they receive a  living allowance (ranging from $100 to $170 per week)
and a bonus upon completion of their  service commitment. Bonuses range up to
$5000 per year of full-time service to a maximum of  $10,000. Some programs
don't require you to use the bonus for education expenses; others give  smaller
bonuses to the non-college bound. In general, the higher the stipend, the lower
the education  bonus. Also, in most programs, workers wear easily identifiable
uniforms (e.g., fashionable red  t-shirts). <BR>
</P>
<P>To learn more about your state's community service programs, request a list
of State Commission  Contacts from the Corporation for National Service (see
resources, below). Here are some sample  programs:<BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>City Volunteer Corps ( New York City)</STRONG>. Founded in 1984,
this was one of the country's first  community-based service programs. Around
750 volunteers each year log countless hours helping  the elderly, tutoring
children and cleaning up parks. In addition, volunteers who have dropped out of 
school must complete work for their GED.<BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>City Year (Boston, Chicago, other cities nationwide)</STRONG>. City
Year is frequently mentioned as a  model for a national plan. Boston alone has
nearly 500 participants (ages 17-24) who clean parks,  organize summer camps,
lead day trips, etc. Workers earn $100 per week with a $5,000 bonus at  the end
of 9-months (the money need not be used for college). Workers are docked for
missed  days. Before the year is over, workers must register to vote, obtain a
library card, produce a  resume, learn to prepare their taxes, and get their GED
(if not already a graduate). 617/927-2500<BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Georgia Peach Corps</STRONG>. The Peach Corps employs about 100
youths, ages 17-25. They work at  minimum wage on selected human service and
public works projects in rural communities. At the  end of one year, they
receive $5,000 in credit toward tuition costs at any college nationwide.<BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Delta Service Corps</STRONG>. The Delta Service Corps places
workers age 17+ in existing community  organizations across some of the poorest
regions of our country (142 counties in Arkansas,  Louisiana and Mississippi).
Corps members receive a $5,000 education voucher for each of two  years of
full-time service; $2,000 for each of three years if they're only serving
part-time. In  January, 1993, the Corps began training its first 270 workers (it
soon plans to expand to 1,000). <BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>New Orleans Youth Action Corps</STRONG> volunteers focus on
recycling projects, using trash and  recyclable materials to create public
sculptures and murals. They're also planting trees and plants on  city river
banks.<BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Teach for America</STRONG>. Recruits recent college grads to spend
two years teaching in understaffed  public schools nationwide 212/425-9039.<BR>
</P>
<P><STRONG>Public Allies (Chicago, Washington, DC, other cities nationwide)</STRONG>.
Interns (Allies) between the  ages of 18 and 30 receive a stipend ($18,000) plus
an education bonus ($5,000). In Chicago, the  focus is on housing issues, health
care and special needs of at-risk youth. Other cities may differ.  Highly
competitive program with as many as 35 applicants per position.<BR>

<P><BR> You may be eligible for financial assistance because your parents were
in the military service or  presently work for a particular company or belong to
a union. A trade group or association can  become a source of aid; so can
parental membership in patriotic, civic or fraternal associations.  Locating
these opportunities will require a systematic approach and considerable parental
 cooperation. The questions below can help organize your search strategy.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Where Do Your Parents Work?</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Loans</STRONG><BR> A growing number of large companies help make it
easier for employee children to participate in the  Stafford Loan program. The
companies put up a reserve against loan defaults, then hire firms like  United
Student Aid Funds to administer the program and find banks to act as lenders.
Ford,  General Electric, Texaco, and Time, are among the 150 that provide this
service. To find out if your  company has such a plan, ask the employee benefits
coordinator or call United Student Aid Funds,  1-800-LOAN-USA.<BR>
</P>
<P>RJR Nabisco goes one better and pays the guarantee fee and subsidizes the
interest rate for PLUS  loan borrowers.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Scholarships</STRONG></FONT><BR> Many companies
sponsor scholarships for employee children as part of their fringe benefit 
programs.<BR>
<STRONG>Merit scholarships</STRONG>. Approximately 2,500 renewable, need-based
awards (ranging from $500 to  $4,000) sponsored by over 400 corporations for
employee children who are Merit Program  Finalists.<BR>
<STRONG>General scholarships</STRONG> for employee children. Sometimes these
scholarship programs are designed  and managed by non-profit services. The
Citizen's Scholarship Fund of America (CSFA), for  example, handles programs for
about 500 companies, distributing in excess of 20,000 scholarships  per year
worth about $33 million. <BR>
<STRONG>FEEA Fund Scholarships</STRONG> for civilian federal employees and
their dependent family members. The  300+ awards (out of 4,700 applications)
range from $300 to $1,500. By May 31. Essay required.  For an application, send
a SASE to the Federal Employee Education and Assistance Fund  Scholarship Award,
8441 W. Bowles Ave., Suite 200, Littleton, CO 80123. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Savings Plans</STRONG><BR> Ask your company's employee benefits
coordinator about any special savings programs. More and  more employers support
and encourage their employees efforts to save for college. Here are some 
examples:<BR>
<STRONG>Contributory Accounts</STRONG>. These work much like retirement
accounts with companies matching their  employee's contributions. RJR Nabisco,
for example, matches employee contributions of up to  $4,000 per child.<BR>
<STRONG>Educational Savings Plans</STRONG>. Using payroll deductions, employees
stash money into a  company-managed educational fund. These may be matched, or
not, depending on the generosity  of the employer. NIKE, for example, matches
employee deposits at a ratio of 25 cents for each $1  to a maximum of $1,000.
<BR>
<STRONG>Free Advice</STRONG>. Some companies don't provide you any extra money,
but they will include free or  discounted college advice as part of your
benefits package. And sometimes good advice is worth  more than an extra $500.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Are Your Parents Members of...</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>A Trade Group or Association?</STRONG><BR> Employees of member firms
may be eligible. Examples: <EM>National Continental Association of  Resolute
Employers; National Office Products Association; National Association of Tobacco
 Distributors. Addresses in Gale's Encyclopedia of Associations</EM>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>A Patriotic/Civic/Fraternal Association?</STRONG><BR> Among many
organizations making awards to members and members' children: <EM>Knights of 
Columbus; International Order of Job's Daughters; United Daughters of the
Confederacy</EM>;  Yes-even the <EM>Society for the Preservation of Barber Shop
Quartets</EM> has sixteen scholarships.  Addresses in <EM>Gale's Encyclopedia
of Associations</EM>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>A Union?</STRONG><BR> Examples: AFSCME, American Federation of
Teachers, Communications Workers of America,  Fire Fighters, Food and Commercial
Workers, Teamsters, Letter Carriers, Chemical Workers,  Postal Workers, Garment
Workers, Hospital &amp; Health Care Employees, Seafarers, Machinists,  Mine
Workers, Transport Workers, etc. For a list of over $4 million in scholarships,
request the 
<EM>AFL-CIO Guide to Union Sponsored Scholarships, Awards, and Student
Financial Aid</EM>. Free  to union members. All others should send $3.00 to
AFL-CIO Publications and Materials Office,  815 16th Street, NW, Rm. 209,

<P>Your background, employment record, religion, and nationality as well as
your membership in clubs  and associations may be the key to financial
opportunity. Here, as in the previous chapter, you will  have to develop a
systematic search strategy. The questions below will get you started.<BR>
<STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Question</STRONG>. Does any job I ever held lead to a financial aid
award? (Rule out baby-sitting for  grouchy Mrs. Grumpelstein). <STRONG>Answer</STRONG>.
Check with the personnel office of your present or former  employers.<BR>
<STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Question</STRONG>. What about my future career ? Any hope for a
scholarship if I become an engineer? 
<STRONG>Answer</STRONG>. See Chapters 20 and 21 for some ideas of what you'll
find. Also, search the Web and  Gale's <EM>Encyclopedia of Associations</EM>
for addresses of professional associations that match your  interests.<BR>
<STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Question</STRONG>. How about my clubs? <STRONG>Answer</STRONG>.
Check with chapter/club president or faculty adviser.<BR>
<STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Question</STRONG>. What about my religious affiliation? Does my
denomination sponsor aid awards? 
<STRONG>Answer</STRONG>. See your minister, priest, or rabbi or write to the
national organizations sponsored by the  denomination. Addresses in Gale's<EM>Encyclopedia
of Associations</EM> in the reference room of the  public library.<BR>
<STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Question</STRONG>. How about my ancestry or my nationality?
<STRONG>Answer</STRONG>. Write to the organizations serving  your ancestry or
your nationality. Addresses in Gale's <EM>Encyclopedia of Associations</EM>.<BR>
What will you find? You can strike pay dirt or you can strike out. But even if
you find nothing, there  is a reward. You will develop good research skills and
become reacquainted with the public library  which had greatly missed your
patronage.</P>

<P>The SAT has become a national industry. The money spent designing tests,
administering tests,  scoring tests, taking tests, teaching test skills,
coaching test takers, disseminating test results, selling  the names and scores
of test takers to eager college recruiters, interpreting scores, analyzing
scores,  publicizing scores, and writing about the test, pro and con, places the
SAT somewhat behind the  automobile industry but far ahead of the horseradish
trade as a contributor to our gross national  product.<BR>
</P>
<P>The result of all this energy resulted in the Scholastic Aptitude Test
adopting a slightly new  name-The Scholastic Assessment Test-and a slightly new
format. The evil antonyms are gone and  students have to generate answers to a
few math problems on their own (as opposed to guessing  via multiple choice).
The initial reaction has been a nationwide panic among little Fermat wanabees 
(and their parents), causing test prep enrollments to double, and our GNP to
soar!<BR>
</P>
<P>Despite the prevailing attitude, this testmania still has no rational
underpinnings. It is a modern  addendum to the classic treatise &quot;Popular
Delusions and the Madness of Crowd.&quot; For the SAT is  not an intelligence
measure. It is not an aptitude measure. Despite its name change, it doesn't
really  assess anything. It is not a predictor of academic success. And getting
high scores on it isn't always  important for gaining college admission. It's
only verifiable characteristics are that, one, test scores  corresponds quite
closely to family income. The higher the income, the higher the scores. And two,
 it thrives on criticism. The more it is attacked and exposed, the more it gains
in universality and  acceptance.<BR>
</P>
<P>But this outburst should not turn you away. High test scores have a direct
monetary application.  They can cost you money or they can make money for you.<BR>
</P>
<P>Cost you money? you ask. How? Suppose you live in a school district which
emphasizes test  teaching. That emphasis will raise scores. And higher scores
cause property values to soar because  parents from everywhere now want to move
to your district so the smarts rub off on junior. Your  $50,000 home with a
swampy basement, shaky foundation, and a indigenous population of  overweight
termites is suddenly worth $100,000, a nice increase that adds $2,500 to your
family  contribution. Frankly, we think enterprising real estate firms should
underwrite SAT preparation  courses. It could be their smartest investment.<BR>
</P>
<P>Now that we have learned how the SAT can cost you money, let's see how it
can make you  money. Here is what good scores can do:<BR>
</P>
<P>1. Qualify you for a National Merit or Regent Scholarship.<BR> 2. Push you
over the eligibility cutoff for collegiate academic scholarships.<BR> 3.	Give
you bargaining power when negotiating the content of a financial aid package.
Your higher  scores make you more valuable to the school because they help raise
the average for the entire  entering freshman class.<BR>
</P>
<P>The hard way to raise SAT scores is to find an error in the test and appeal
it. An easier way is to  wait for the College Board to recenter everyone's
scores (the Class of 1996 was the first to benefit  from these new, higher,
averages). The easiest way is to take a good SAT prep course-but take it  for
the practical reasons listed above and not for any mythological reasons. If a
$500 investment in  a SAT prep course yields a $2,000 no-need scholarship,
renewed each year for four years, you  have done far better with your money than
the shrewdest Wall Street stockbroker.<BR>
</P>
<P>Two national organizations are Stanley Kaplan, Ltd. (800-KAP-TEST,
<A HREF="http://www.Kaplan.com">http://www.Kaplan.com</A>)  and The Princeton
Review (800-2-REVIEW, <A HREF="http://www.review.com">http://www.review.com</A>).
Their &quot;teaching&quot; styles are  very different and they have no great
love for each other, but they both have great track records for  raising scores.
Call the above numbers for the nearest test center. You might also ask about any
 school-sponsored test prep courses, or local test prep services. The fees will
be lower, and, usually,  the results just as good. Of course, if you're really
disciplined, Stanley Kaplan and The Princeton  Review also publish test prep
books and CD Roms for &quot;self-study.&quot; Or you might visit Stanford 
Testing Program's free on-line service (WebWare for the SAT) at

scholarships are not limited to those with prowess in the big sports-football,
baseball,  basketball, hockey, soccer, tennis, and track. There is scholarship
money for sailing, badminton,  gymnastics, lacrosse, bowling, archery, fencing,
rowing, synchronized swimming, skiing and  volleyball.<BR>
</P>
<P>All-star athletes don't need this book. They need an (unofficial) agent who
can sort through all the  offers, enticements, contracts and gifts that come
their way. They might need a mechanic, too, to  advise them on the relative
merits of a Porsche or a Mercedes.<BR>
</P>
<P>This chapter is for the better-than-average athlete with varsity potential
in major and minor sports.  What's available for this athlete? How can you link
up? Here is the situation in a nutshell: There is  considerable financial aid at
most colleges for students who are good, but not necessarily great,  athletes.
This aid is either &quot;reserved&quot; for athletes (through designated
scholarships) or awarded on a  preferential basis as part of the financial aid
packaging process.<BR>
</P>
<P>The key to receiving consideration for this kind of aid lies in the student
athlete's determination to  market his or her talents. This marketing procedure
is based on contacting the appropriate coach at  the desired college and getting
that coach to shepherd the student's request for admission and  financial aid
through the bureaucracy of the various admission and financial aid offices. All
college  coaches, if convinced of the student athlete's potential contribution
to their team, will take an active  role in facilitating the student's admission
and financial requests. For example, some schools have  admission
representatives whose main responsibility is to coordinate referrals from the
athletic  department.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Here is a step-by-step outline to follow in marketing your athletic
talents:</STRONG><BR> 1. Start early. Discuss with your HS counselor the range
of colleges for which you are academically  qualified. In selecting suitable
schools, keep in mind that approximately 20% of all colleges will  reconsider
their admission standards to &quot;land&quot; an athlete.<BR> 2. Talk to your
HS coach about the quality of collegiate athletic programs for which you might 
qualify. Don't sell yourself short. Coaches need backup players as well as
starters.<BR> 3. Narrow your college selection list to a manageable size,
taking into consideration the quality of  athletic and academic programs and
your &quot;fit&quot; with them. In other words, you <EM>don't</EM> want to be a
 four-year bench-warmer; you <EM>do</EM> want to be challenged by the school's
academic program (but not  over- or underwhelmed).<BR> 4. Research the name of
the coach in your sport at each college on your list. Best source: your high 
school athletic director's copy of <EM>The National Directory of College
Athletics </EM>(there are separate  editions of this book for men and women).
You should probably do a follow up call to the athletic  department to verify
this name, and make certain that coach is still at the school and coaching your 
sport.<BR> 5. Draft a personal letter to each coach. This letter should include
a profile of your academic  interests and achievements. The letter's main part,
however, should be a thorough and detailed  discussion of your athletic
accomplishments and be supported by statistics, clippings, letters earned, 
records, and honors. Include mention of any camps or clinics you've attended,
and if appropriate, a  videotape of yourself in action (keep it to 10 minutes,
look enthusiastic, start with skills, move on to  &quot;game&quot; highlights
and make certain you're easily identifiable)! If your real value to the team is
as a  leader and motivator rather than a top scorer, make that clear. (Have you
won any awards for  sportsmanship?) Lastly, indicate you will need financial
aid.<BR> 6. If your approach elicits interest from the colleges, ask the high
school coach to follow up with a  letter of recommendation or a phone call. You
should also send the college a schedule of your  games in case recruiters are
nearby!<BR> 7. Now you must decide where to apply. Few coaches will take an
interest in you unless your initial  letter is followed by a formal application.
And remember, here, as with any other application, apply  as early as possible.<BR>
8. After applying, remain in touch with the college coaches. Inquire about the
status of your  application and request for financial aid. If possible, visit
the college and sell yourself as a person  and as an athlete. Get to know the
coach, and make certain his or her coaching philosophy is  compatible with your
style!</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Certification</STRONG></FONT><BR> All students who
intend to practice and play their sport at a Division I or II school during
their  freshman year must have their eligibility certified by a central
clearinghouse. Essentially, the NCAA  wants to make certain all student-athletes
are exactly that, and has instituted minimum academic  requirements for
athletes. <BR>
</P>
<P>Beginning in August, 1996, &quot;qualifiers&quot; must have a GPA of at
least 2.0 in a core curriculum of 13  academic courses (a combination of
English, math, social science, and natural or physical science)  and have a
combined SAT score (after recentering) of 820 (or an ACT score of 17). To be a 
Division I qualifier, you must meet slightly higher standards. The NCAA has
developed a sliding  scale of acceptable GPA/SAT/ACT scores. If you squeak in
with an 820 SAT (or 17 ACT), you  must have a 2.5 GPA to qualify. If your SATs
(or ACTs) are higher than 820, you can get away  with a slightly lower GPA (but
never lower than a 2.0). <BR>
</P>
<P>To register for the Clearinghouse, first read the NCAA brochure called <EM>Making
Sure You Are  Eligible to Participate in College Sports</EM>, then complete the
accompanying student release form  and send one copy of it (along with a check
for $18) to the Clearinghouse. Give the other two  copies of the form to your
counselor; one to put in your HS files, the other to send to the  Clearinghouse,
along with a copy of your HS transcript (listing core courses). Students who
qualify  for a fee waiver for the SAT/ACT may also receive a fee waiver for the
Clearinghouse. <BR> Your counselors can obtain all these registration materials
(which are free) by calling the  Clearinghouse at (319) 337-1492. Note:
Eligibility certification has no bearing on your admission to  a particular
Division I or II institution. </P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Recruiting Violations</STRONG></FONT><BR> The NCAA
publishes a 512-page book full of rules and regulations. Violating one of these
rules or  regulations can quickly turn you into an &quot;ineligible&quot;
athlete. For a brief overview of recruiting  guidelines, ask your counselor for
a copy of the NCAA <EM>Guide for the College-Bound  Student-Athlete</EM>. While
this 16-page pamphlet is by no means complete, it does touch on the major 
issues, and warn you about what kinds of behavior can cause you trouble. <BR>
</P>
<P>When should you start worrying about these do's and don'ts? As soon as you
become a  &quot;Prospective Student Athlete&quot; (which happens when you start
ninth-grade), although there's no need  to become obsessive until you become a &quot;Recruited
Prospective Student Athlete.&quot; This occurs the  moment a college coach (or
representative of the school's &quot;athletic interests&quot;) approaches you or
a  member of your family about participating in athletics at that college. &quot;Contact&quot;
means providing you  (or a member of your family) with an official visit,
calling you more than once, or visiting you  anywhere other than the college
campus.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Commercial Scouting Services and Agents </STRONG><BR> Colleges often
pay services to help them find top notch athletes. These services go around the 
country evaluating talent and selling this data to colleges, usually in the form
of ratings booklets.  Scouting services might also sell videotapes of HS games.
You, however, are not likely to have any  contact with these services. Why? In
an effort to stem the growing perception that college sports  are little more
than feeders for professional teams, the NCAA keeps tightening the rules
regarding  recruiting and limiting the type of contact a coach may have with
prospects.<BR> As for agents, be careful. You can jeopardize your college
eligibility by speaking to an unauthorized  rep, by speaking to an authorized
rep outside the approved contact period, or by agreeing to  professional
representation while still in HS or college (even if &quot;the deal&quot;
doesn't become effective  until after you finish college).</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>The Pros and Cons of Exposure Services</STRONG><BR> Exposure services,
or placement services, represent the student in the search for athletic 
scholarships. These services can cost you from $500-$800 and they generally just
follow the eight  steps outlined previously! In other words, many people feel
they're a waste of money since there is  no reason why you can't &quot;sell&quot;
yourself and save the services' fee. Also, some college coaches say  they're a
bit skeptical of organizations that claim they can do more for a high school
student than his  or her high school coach (after all, your HS coach is the
person who should be most familiar with  your abilities). Furthermore, you
shouldn't base your choice of college on its athletic opportunities  alone!
<BR>
</P>
<P>On the flip side, some exposure services are good and many students and
schools are pleased with  their results. From the students' perspective, it's an
easy way to get their athletic profile sent to as  many as 600 colleges.
Students can then just sit back and wait for nibbles. From the school's 
perspective, since the athletes pay the fee, the school is getting perfectly
good, free information on  hundreds of potential student-athletes. These
services are most useful for students who participate in  &quot;minor sports&quot;
(regardless of the school) or who are interested in smaller, less athletically
prominent  schools (regardless of the sport). <BR>
</P>
<P>If you decide to use a placement service, make certain you choose a
reputable one. Here are two  suggestions: One, find a service that specializes
in your sport, for example, the Collegiate Softball  Connection in San
Francisco; two, go with one of the biggies, College Prospects of America  (<A
HREF="http://www.jette.com/cpoa">http://www.jette.com/cpoa</A>) or College
Bound Student Athletes (<A HREF="http://www.in.net/cbsa">http://www.in.net/cbsa</A>).
Both of  these organizations have agents (salesmen?) scattered across the 50
states and serve thousands of  students per year. Both of these organizations
also recognize the need to match a student's level of  athletic and academic
ability with appropriate colleges and say they reject students without real 
athletic potential. Why? Because overselling students would cause them to lose
credibility with the  colleges and in a word-of-mouth type of business, you
can't put a price tag on credibility. <BR> If you have internet access, you
might also look into a free service from Allsport, 
<A HREF="http://www.irc-coordinator.com">http://www.irc-coordinator.com</A>.
<BR>
</P>
<P>Again, most students can do as well on their own, however, if you have
questions about placement  services, call the NCAA. While the NCAA doesn't make
any endorsements, it can steer you clear  of shady businesses. If you use a
service, be careful about how it determines your fee. The NCAA  prohibits them
from receiving money based on the value of your scholarship. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Preferential Packaging vs. Athletic Scholarships</STRONG><BR>
Preferential aid packaging can be a better deal than an athletic scholarship. If
you have a personality  conflict with the coach or run into a physical problem
that keeps you from competing, you can lose  your scholarship. The financial aid
package, once it is wrapped up, will hold for a year.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Graduation Rates </STRONG><BR> Don't let headlines scare you. Most of
the abuses you read about are restricted to big name  (Division I) men's
football and basketball programs. The fact is, most students who compete in 
collegiate athletic programs have a higher graduation rate than other students
and fare better  economically in the job market.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Locating Scholarships in Your Sport</STRONG><BR> Check your HS
guidance office for a copy of Peterson's <EM>Sports Scholarships and Athletic 
Programs</EM> ($21.95). It lists colleges that offer sports scholarships (broken
down by sport). Women  should also get <EM>The Women's Collegiate Sports
Scholarship Guide</EM> $3.00 from the Women's  Sports Foundation, Eisenhower
Park, East Meadow, NY, 11554, 1-800-227-3988.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Sports Careers</STRONG><BR> The NCAA awards more than $1 million to
student-athletes (at Division I, II and III schools) who  are pursuing an
athletics-related career or post-graduate program. Four programs are for 
postgraduates; one is for undergraduates who have completed eligibility for
athletically-related aid  (i.e., they entered college at least five years ago).

have to foot the bill alone. To do this, they  would have to raise tuition so
high, no student could afford to enroll). Your challenge is to look for  funded
schools and negotiate with the Dean for some of the spoils. Or at least to take
advantage of  any extra student aid dollars. When writing to the addresses

<P>The best way to capitalize on your career interest is through cooperative
education. The next best  way is to enroll in a school with a strong reputation
in your career field (e.g., Agriculture-<EM>Iowa  State</EM>; Hotel Management-<EM>Cornell</EM>).
Strong departments usually attract scholarship funds. These  funds, however, do
not start flowing until you declare your major. The third-and hardest method-is 
to look for portable scholarships that will fund your major at any accredited
school. The list that  follows is illustrative, rather than complete. To dig for
additional awards, contact the organizations  that provide career information in
your field of interest (you'll find them in <EM>Need a Lift?</EM>) and the 
professional associations which serve these careers (locate these using a search
engine on the  World Wide Web or Gale's <EM>Encyclopedia of Associations</EM>).

disabled students frequently incur special expenses while attending college.
Make sure  these expenses are reflected in your student budget (see
<A HREF="ch06.html">Chapter 6</A>). This, in turn, will increase your  need and
you'll qualify for more aid. <BR>
</P>
<P>Your best source of information on special student aid is the Office of

<BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>PART-TIMERS</STRONG></FONT><BR> Most financial aid is
based on being at least a half-time student. But take heart. Uncle's definition
of  &quot;half-time&quot; is more generous than at most schools, therefore, we
urge you to apply for federal  student aid even if you aren't sure what your
status will be (see <A HREF="ch10.html">Chapter 10</A>). Also, under current 
law, colleges must set aside some of their SEOG and Federal Work-study fund for
assistance to  less than half-time (i.e., part-time) students. Several states
also help part-timers, so check with them  as well (addresses in
<A HREF="ch11.html">Chapter 11</A>).<BR>
<STRONG>Our Suggestion</STRONG>: Take another course, and boost your status to
half-time.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>ARE YOU 50, 60 OR OLDER?</STRONG><BR> If you plan to study at least
half-time, most financial aid is awarded on the basis of need and not  age.
Hence, you can freely compete with those who are just out of high school and
anybody else for  all available financial aid.<BR>
</P>
<P>If you plan to take just a few courses, many schools will offer you reduced
tuition. Many will even  let you attend courses for free or on a space available
basis. <BR>
</P>
<P>Similarly, many states also reduce tuition for older citizens, for example,
Alabama, Arkansas,  Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Guam, Illinois, Iowa,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota,  Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New
Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Rhode Island,  South Carolina, Tennessee,
Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.  Some states waive
tuition entirely. Eligibility varies from state to state, but generally,
students must  be state residents age 60+ and attend state schools. Sometimes
the discount is given to students  only on a space available basis. Check your
local college or state higher education agency  (addresses in
<A HREF="ch11.html">Chapter 11</A>).<BR>

<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>Are You Only 25? 30?</STRONG></FONT><BR> Over 44% of
all college students are 25 or older. Your best bet for financial aid (assuming
you  aren't a multi-millionaire) is that you will be filing your FAFSA as an
independent student, thus only  your own income and assets are assessed in
calculating expected family contribution. <BR>

<P>Graduate student aid falls into three main categories: Fellowships,
assistantships and loans. Neither  fellowships nor assistantships need to be
repaid, however both usually require some sort of service  (e.g., conducting
research, working with faculty or teaching undergraduates). Most students rely
on  a combination of these three aid sources, however, Doctoral candidates are
most likely to receive  fellowships and assistantships, Master's students are
most likely to receive a balance of  assistantships and loans, and professional
students are most likely to receive loans. <BR>
</P>
<P>Further analysis of graduate student aid shows that of non-doctoral
students, those in law, medicine  and business have the largest loans. Those in
engineering and the natural sciences receive the largest  assistantships, and
those in the natural sciences, medicine and the social sciences receive the
largest  fellowships. Similarly, of Doctoral students, those in medicine have
the largest loans, those in  engineering and the natural sciences receive the
largest assistantships, and those in the natural  sciences and the humanities
receive the largest fellowships.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>70% of All Graduate Aid</STRONG></FONT><BR> To learn
where 70% of all graduate aid is, go back to the beginning of this book. First,
you must  enhance your eligibility for aid. The lessons in <A HREF="ch04.html">Chapters
4</A>, <A HREF="ch05.html">5</A>, <A HREF="ch06.html">6</A>, and
<A HREF="ch07.html">7</A> are as applicable to graduate  students as they are
to undergrads. Second, review <A HREF="ch10.html">Chapter 10</A> and become
familiar with federal  sources of aid: Stafford Loans, Perkins Loans and
Work-Study. If your future is in a medical field,  add <A HREF="ch20.html">Chapter
20</A> to your reading. And, if all else fails, investigate the commercial loan
sources listed  in <A HREF="ch07.html">Chapter 7</A>. <STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>:
Graduate students are not eligible for Pell Grants or SEOGs.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>3% of All Graduate Aid</STRONG></FONT><BR> For 3% of
all graduate aid, check with your home state. Alabama, Alaska, Arizona,
Arkansas,  California, Colorado, Delaware, DC, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas,
Louisiana, Maine, Maryland,  Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, New
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma,  Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont,
Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin offer $28  million in
need-based aid and $36 million in non need-based aid. This money is not evenly 
distributed among the states. For example, New York alone awards $12.7 million
to graduate  students! <BR>
</P>
<P>Also, many of these opportunities are sharply restricted in terms of major
field of study (e.g.,  medicine, law, dentistry) or population group which
benefits (e.g., minority). Furthermore students  must usually enroll at an
in-state school.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>10% of All Graduate Aid</STRONG></FONT><BR> About 10%
of all graduate aid is dispersed throughout this book. For instance, if you get
a  commission in the military and are willing to extend your period of service,
you may qualify for  graduate training. Employer-paid tuition and cooperative
education (<A HREF="ch12.html">Chapter 12</A>) are also rich in  graduate
opportunities. And you'll find more in <A HREF="ch21.html">Chapters 21</A> and
<A HREF="ch22.html">22</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>12% of All Graduate Aid</STRONG></FONT><BR> For 12% of
all graduate aid you must talk to your department chair. Here is how these
people can  help you:<BR>
</P>
<P>With departmental fellowships and grants. These are the most prestigious
forms of aid and require  very little from you in return. <BR>
</P>
<P>With graduate assistantships. Consider this an apprenticeship. While you
have to work (quite a bit)  for your money, the experience will look wonderful
on your Curriculum Vitae (the academic version  of a resume).<BR>
</P>
<P>With internships and summer jobs. With any luck, you may even find work you
can turn into your  thesis or dissertation.<BR>
</P>
<P>With employment funded by a grant. In most instances, the professor gets the
grant, but will need  grad students to help count chromosomes, wash test tubes,
show slides, or lead discussion groups.<BR>
</P>
<P>In graduate school, the committee that decides on admission also decides on
these departmental  awards. To better your chances for both, get to know the
faculty. After you apply for admission,  make appointments to meet professors in
your area of interest. If it's relevant, send them a copy of  your undergraduate
thesis (or a research paper). Visit their classrooms. Observe their teaching 
styles. Be humble. And remember, unless you're applying to professional schools
(law, medicine,  business, engineering), your most important consideration
should be to find a professor with whom  you want to work. The reputation of the
university is secondary to the reputation of the individual  departments.<BR>
</P>
<P>You might also consider going to work for a university. Many schools
discount tuition for full-time  employees, and while it may take you a few extra
years to get through the program, you won't have  a huge debt burden when you're
through.</P>
<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4"><STRONG>1% of All Graduate Aid</STRONG></FONT><BR> That you

<BR> In an ideal world, the sound of the budget ax one year would be replaced
by the burble of flowing  federal funds the next. Unfortunately, that's not
likely. Students today must cope with aid funding  that doesn't keep pace with
rising tuition costs. For these students, the slogan is &quot;know more about 
every aspect of financial aid or dig deeper.&quot; To save you the purchase of a
new shovel, here is a  summary of the skills you, as a student today, must
master.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Selecting a College (I) </STRONG><BR> When picking a college, go
beyond the normal search criteria, such as majors offered, academic  reputation,
and distance from home, and inquire about innovative tuition aid features. These
may  include matching scholarships, sibling scholarships, guaranteed cost plans,
installment plans, special  middle income assistance programs, tuition remission
for high grades, etc. <BR> See <A HREF="ch09.html">Chapter 9</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Selecting a College (II) </STRONG><BR> All factors being equal, pick
colleges most likely to offer you a financial aid package rich in grants  you
don't have to repay. Such a package is a lot better than one made up of loans
which will saddle  you with a repayment burden for many years after graduation.
Best bet: Any school in which your  academic record places you in the upper 25%
of the profile of the incoming freshman class. <BR> See <A HREF="ch07.html">Chapters
7</A> and <A HREF="ch09.html">9</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Selecting a College (III) </STRONG><BR> Send applications to two
colleges of equal merit. If you get accepted by both, you might be able to  play
one against the other in securing a more favorable package. <BR> See
<A HREF="ch07.html">Chapters 7</A> and <A HREF="ch09.html">9</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Try the External Degree Route </STRONG><BR> Win a sheepskin without
ever leaving home or job. Such a diploma will cost less in money and time  than
if it had been earned through campus attendance. External degrees offer academic
credit for  documented learning and experience you have already acquired, and
couples these with formal  assessments. <BR> See <A HREF="ch07.html">Chapter 7</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Do Four Years Work in Three</STRONG><BR> You must attend summer
school, but the compressed time will save you the &quot;inflationary increase&quot;
of  the fourth year. On a similar note, try to avoid taking extra years to get
through college. Fewer and  fewer students are graduating in four
years...costing them a whole extra year's tuition.<BR> See <A HREF="ch07.html">Chapter
7</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Start at a Community College</STRONG><BR> Work hard. Get good grades.
Transfer to a solid four-year institution. This way, you pick up the  halo of a
prestige diploma at half the cost.<BR> See <A HREF="ch07.html">Chapter 7</A>.
</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Understand How Need Analysis Works</STRONG><BR> By knowing the
formulas, the shrewd family can present its financial picture in such a way as
to  obtain a more favorable need analysis. This isn't unlike the method used for
presenting one's  financial picture to the IRS so as to qualify for the smallest
possible tax liability. <BR> See <A HREF="ch06.html">Chapters 6</A> and
<A HREF="ch07.html">7</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Try Some &quot;What If?&quot; Calculations</STRONG><BR> But first,
learn how need analysis works. A typical &quot;what if&quot;: Is this a good
time for mom or dad to  finish their college work, along with son and daughter?
Or will it be more advantageous, financially,  for your parent to go back to
work and help with expenses? You'll be surprised at the dollar figures 
generated by &quot;what if&quot; drills. <BR> See <A HREF="ch07.html">Chapter
7</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Don't Pass Up the Entitlement Programs</STRONG><BR> Billions in
low-interest, subsidized federal student loans go unused each year simply
because  students think they are ineligible, don't bother to go through the
paper work hassle, or just don't  know about the program. <BR> See
<A HREF="ch10.html">Chapter 10</A>. </P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Cash Flow (I)</STRONG><BR> Search for a low-interest, private loan.
Numerous states have set up loan authorities which float  tax-exempt bonds to
raise student loan money. And colleges themselves have received permission  to
issue such bonds. At the same time, private banks are becoming more innovative
in sponsoring  combination savings/lending plans. Keep an eye out for these
developments. They can help  middle-income families with the cash flow problem
of paying for college. <BR> See <A HREF="ch06.html">Chapters 6</A>,
<A HREF="ch07.html">7</A>, and <A HREF="ch09.html">9</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Cash Flow (II)</STRONG><BR> Go to college on the house. Many home
owners have accumulated large amounts of equity in their  houses and they want
to put it to work. Your strategy: Releasing this equity either through a line of
 credit or through refinancing the first mortgage. <BR> See
<A HREF="ch07.html">Chapters 7</A> and <A HREF="ch09.html">9</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Negotiate With the Financial Aid Administrator</STRONG><BR> The FAA
will present you with a package of assistance that should, in theory, cover the
difference  between what college costs and what your family can contribute. If
you feel the college really wants  you, because you are a brain or an athlete or
the child of an alum or can help it meet a geographic  or minority quota, you
may want to ask the FAA about improving the package. Your objective: To 
increase the grant component (money that doesn't have to be repaid) and reduce
the loan  component (money you must repay). <BR> See <A HREF="ch06.html">Chapters
6</A>, <A HREF="ch07.html">7</A>, and <A HREF="ch09.html">9</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Try for an Academic Scholarship</STRONG><BR> Over 1200 colleges offer
academic scholarships to students with a B average and SAT scores of  900 or
more. Middle income folks take notice: Most of these scholarships are not based
on  financial need. If you are just outside the SAT eligibility range for one of
these awards, take a good  SAT preparation course. It may raise your scores
enough to enter the winner's circle.<BR> See <A HREF="ch18.html">Chapter 18</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Go the Cooperative Education Route</STRONG><BR> Over 900 colleges
offer co-op education programs. Alternate formal study with periods of 
career-related work. Earn up to $7,000 per year during the work phase. It may
take an extra year  to win the degree, but it will be easier on the pocketbook.
<BR> See <A HREF="ch12.html">Chapter 12</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Athletic Student Aid</STRONG><BR> We aren't talking about the &quot;Body
by Nautilus, Mind by Mattel&quot; tackle who can do 40 yards in 4  seconds.
Husky U. will find that person. We're talking about students who are better than
average  in a variety of sports, ranging from tennis to golf to lacrosse. A
great many colleges seek people  who can be developed into varsity material. The
rewards come in two forms: outright scholarships  or &quot;improved&quot;
financial aid packages. <BR> See <A HREF="ch19.html">Chapter 19</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Acceleration</STRONG><BR> Can you get credit for a semester or a year
of college work? You can through the Advanced  Placement Program or by enrolling
in college courses in high school. When credits can cost as much  as $300 each,
receiving tuition credit for academic credit leaves money in the bank.<BR> See
<A HREF="ch07.html">Chapter 7</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Be An Accurate, Early Bird</STRONG><BR> Be as accurate as possible in
filling out financial aid forms. Submit them as early as you can. When 
resources are tight, it's first-come, first-served. Those who must resubmit
their forms and those who  are slow in applying come in at the end of the line.
By then, all the money is gone. <BR> See <A HREF="ch06.html">Chapters 6</A>
and <A HREF="ch07.html">7</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Check the Military Offerings</STRONG><BR> Reserve enlistments are
especially attractive. For a hitch in the National Guard you can pick up a 
state benefit, a federal bonus, partial loan forgiveness, drill pay, sergeant
stripes (if you also  participate in ROTC), and in some cases, tuition remission
at the state university. And these are not  &quot;either/or&quot; opportunities.
You can have most of them, or all of them. <BR> See <A HREF="ch13.html">Chapter
13</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Take Advantage of Teacher Mania</STRONG><BR> Individual colleges, most
states, and Uncle Sam all have loan forgiveness programs for prospective 
teachers. Go this route and your education will cost you very little. You teach
Ohm's law for four  years to pay off the obligation. You pick up a little
maturity, a lot of patience. You contribute to the  well-being of hundreds of
scholars-to-be. And you're still young enough to begin a different career if 
teaching is not for you. <BR> See <A HREF="ch09.html">Chapters 9</A> and
<A HREF="ch11.html">11</A>.</P>
<P><BR>
<STRONG>Sacrifice</STRONG><BR> You may have to give up a few luxuries:
Canceling your pet's Beverly Hills grooming sessions can  save you $3,200 per
dog per year; using a Volkswagen instead of your Lear jet can save you $540  per
tank of gas.</P>

<P>

Consider these factors carefully before you make an educational loan commitment.</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

<B>Eligibility.</B>  Some loan programs are based on financial need, i.e. the

Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan, while others require creditworthiness, i.e., 

Federal PLUS and other alternative loan programs.</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

<B>Capitalization.</B>  Some loan programs, such as the Federal Unsubsidized

Stafford, allow borrowers to defer interest payments while in school, during

grace, and/or deferment periods.  In such instances,  the interest accrues and

will be added onto the principal balance of the loan.</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

<B>Amount.</B>  You may need to borrow more money as educational expenses

increase, however, never borrow more than you will need.</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

<B>Loan Limits.</B>  Most loan programs specify minimum and maximum amounts,

(annual and aggregate) that you can borrow.</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

<B>Different Lenders and Loan Programs.</B>  You can reduce the potential for

multiple monthly payments and simplify your records by staying with one lender

and one loan program whenever possible.</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

<B>Length of Repayment Period.</B>  You will save interest costs if you make

larger and/or additional payments.  Most loans must be repaid within ten years,

although in some cases, federal loans may be consolidated and the repayment

period extended.<U></U></P>

<P>

<U></U></P>

<P>

<B>Interest Rates.</B>  Interest rates on <A></A><A HREF="#student.html">Federal</A>

 loan programs are subject to change and they vary with each program. </P>

<P>

<B>Monthly Repayment Requirements.</B>  Some loan programs require minimum

monthly loan payments.</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

<B>Total Indebtedness.</B>  Monthly payments increase as the total debt

increases.  (Refer to repayment chart on the opposite page.)</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

<B>Satisfactory Academic Progress.</B>  You must maintain satisfactory academic

progress, as defined by your institution, in order to remain eligible for

educational loans.</P>

<P>

<B>Special Plans.</B>  Internships, deferments, and foreign study may lengthen

the time before repayment begins.</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

When borrowing a student loan, think carefully about four key points:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Loans are obligations that must be repaid.

</LI>

<LI>Loans must be repaid even if, for whatever reason, you do not complete your

program of study or are not satisfied with your education.

</LI>

<LI>The amount of money you decide to borrow now can affect your lifestyle

after you leave school.

</LI>

<LI>Your ability or inability to repay will affect your credit worthiness for

other credit-based purchases such as a car or a home.

</LI> 

</OL>

and make sure to <A HREF="budget.html"><B>budget</B></A> wisely.</B></CENTER>

need them.</I>

<P>

Budgeting your educational costs is the first step towards college financing.

Begin by totaling the cost of your education and then investigate all financing

options.  You will want to keep in mind that the amount of educational debt you

incur will impact your career choice and future lifestyle.  Planning ahead makes

the difference.  You may want to print out this budgeting guide for your

records.

</P>

<P>

 As you begin the budgeting process, remember these important points:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>Be realistic. Don't slash any basic necessities, but don't  be extravagant

either.  Allow a little extra for emergencies or unanticipated expenses.

</LI>

<LI>Be flexible.  Adjust your budget when changes occur.  A budget won't work

if it feels too tight (or too loose).

</LI>

<LI>Keep it simple. Don't itemize in such minute detail that budgeting becomes

a chore.

</LI>

<LI>Give it time.  Allow yourself time to get accustomed to using a budget.

You'll find that in time you will have a better understanding of your expenses

and your ability to control them.

</LI>

</UL>

<HR>

<H2>You May Want To Print This Out for Your Records</H2>

<P><B>Step One:  Estimate your total resources.</B>

</P>

<P>

The first step in budgeting your educational costs is to estimate your total

resources.  Savings, jobs, parents' contribution, financial aid and outside

scholarships are all important sources of educational funding.  The amount of

financial aid you will receive can be found on the award letter from your

school.  When in doubt on any of the amounts enter your lowest estimate.

</P>

<H4>YOUR CONTRIBUTION</H4>

COLSTART="1"><B>Total</B></TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR></TABLE>

<HR>

<H4>Step Two:  Determine your educational expenses.</H4>

<P>Now you need to determine what your educational expenses will be for the

full year.  The bill from your school will show what your tuition and fee

charges will be.  Make your best estimate of what you'll need to cover other

related costs such as books and supplies

</P>

<TABLE><TR><TD COLSTART="1">Tuition</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR><TR

><TD COLSTART="1">Fees</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR><TR><TD

COLSTART="1"><B>Total</B></TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR></TABLE>

<HR>

<H4>Step Three:  Determine your remaining funds.</H4>

<P>By subtracting your educational expenses from your total resources, you'll

find out your remaining funds for the school year.  Before you start to feel

rich, remember there are many more expenses to consider

</P>

<TABLE><TR><TD COLSTART="1">Funds</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR><TR>

<TD COLSTART="1">Less Expenses</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR><TR><TD

COLSTART="1">Remaining Funds</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR></TABLE>

<HR>

<P>

<B>Step Four:  Determine Your Additional Expenses.</B></P>

<P>There are many expenses not directly related to educational costs which you

must take into consideration.  Some of these expenses are unavoidable, others

represent your personal lifestyle.  Enter amounts for the ones which apply to

you.</P>

<TABLE><TR><TD COLSTART="1">Housing</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR><TR

><TD COLSTART="1">Food</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR><TR><TD

COLSTART="1">Car/Transportation</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR><TR><TD

 COLSTART="1">Clothing</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR><TR><TD

COLSTART="1">Insurance</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR><TR><TD

COLSTART="1">Medical</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR><TR><TD

COLSTART="1">Personal</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR><TR><TD

COLSTART="1">Entertainment</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR><TR><TD

COLSTART="1">Miscellaneous</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR><TR><TD

COLSTART="1">Savings</TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR><TR><TD

COLSTART="1"><B>TOTAL</B></TD><TD COLSTART="2">$__________</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>Now the moment of truth . . . Do your expenses amount to more than your

remaining funds?  If so, you need to make some adjustments.  Are there any

expenses you can reduce? Are there any additional ways of making or saving

<P>

 </P><IMG SRC="images/banr_bar.jpg">

<P>

	When you apply for an educational loan, you are taking your first step toward

establishing credit.  Credit is simply a promise to pay later for goods,

services or money that you receive now.  You can control both your use of credit

and your credit record by budgeting and planning ahead. Consider your

eligibility under various loan programs and how this debt will affect your

future lifestyle.  Keep your debt level manageable.</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

	Simply stated, if you borrow student loans, you are purchasing a portion of

your education on credit.  It is a promise to pay later for goods, services, or

money that you receive now.  Remember, credit is not free; you are charged

interest on the money that you borrow.</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

	Your use of credit and your bill paying habits are collected and distributed by

credit bureaus.  When you apply for any type of credit (credit cards, car loan,

mortgage, etc.), a copy of your credit history is released to the lender or

retailer.  This report is utilized to determine whether or not you properly

handle credit.  Maintaining a good credit history may not seem important to you

now, but you will rely on credit for many future purchases.  The necessity of

good credit cannot be stressed enough.  An unfavorable credit rating will remain

on your record for seven years, affecting your ability to take out a loan,

obtain credit cards, buy a car, or obtain a mortgage.</P>

<P>

	</P>

<P>

What if unforeseen circumstances arise and you find yourself unable to pay your

bills?  Don't just ignore the situation.  The first thing to do is contact the

creditor before your bills are overdue to see what arrangements can be made. 

Most creditors, if they are aware of your circumstances and are convinced that

you intend to pay, are understanding and willing to help.  If you should find

yourself in a serious situation, you should seek assistance from your financial

aid administrator.</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

Most students enter repayment within six months after graduation or their last

day of attendance at school.  Your lender and/or servicer will send letters

regarding your student loans and arrange a repayment plan.  If your lender does

not contact you, you are required to contact your lender.</P>

<P>

	</P>

<P>

If you can make payments on your loan while in school and/or during the grace

period, do so.  All payments made during the grace period may reduce the total

amount you owe.  Contact your lender for more information on prepayment.

Remember, there is no penalty for prepaying your student loan. </P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

	Promptly paying your student loan each month will help you establish a good

credit record.  Good credit is an asset when applying for other credit, such as

a car loan or home mortgage.  Frequent late payments constitute   delinquency

and may harm your credit rating.  Here are some tips on avoiding delinquency:</P>

<P>

</P>

<UL>

<LI>Notify your lender(s)/servicer(s) whenever your name or address changes.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>Send the payment due each month, even if you have not received a bill. When

you are in repayment, send large or additional payments to reduce the amount of

interest you will pay on the loan.  Make sure you specify that it should be

applied to the principal or balance of the loan, not to interest.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>Call your lender immediately if you realize you are unable to make a

payment on time or face financial hardship.  The lender may be able to offer a

forbearance or a deferment if you qualify.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>Know your deferment rights and request and complete all necessary forms. 

Follow up to be sure that your lender has received your forms and that your

loans have been deferred.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>Make sure you understand your rights and responsibilities under each loan

program.  Keep all paperwork such as promissory notes, lender correspondence,

canceled checks, etc.

<P>

</P></LI>

</UL>

<UL><LI>Always call to resolve a discrepancy.  Never ignore correspondence or

requests for payment from your lender(s).  </LI>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>&#191;Necesita dinero para sus estudios? </B></FONT>

</P>

<P>

Existen varias fuentes para ayudarle con sus gastos educacionales, desde becas y

donaciones hasta pr&eacute;stamos educacionales y programmas de trabajo y de

estudio.

</P>

<P>

Este folleto analiza tres tipos de pr&eacute;stamos auspiciados por el gobierno

disponibles a trav&eacute;s de Signet Bank.  Estos pr&eacute;stamos deben

utilizarse para pagar gastos relacionados con el estudio, como por ejemplo, la

matr&iacute;cula, los libros, el alojamiento, comidas y otros gastos de

mantenimiento.  Todos los pr&eacute;stamos ofrecen una atractiva tasa de int&eacute;res

y convenientes plazos de amortizaci&oacute;n.

<LI><B><A HREF="#stafford">Pr&eacute;stamo Federal Stafford (subsidiado)</A></B>

(anteriormente conocido como Pr&eacute;stamo Garantizado para Estudiantes) - Pr&eacute;stamo

basado en la necesidad, determinado de acuerdo en el ingreso familiar, activos y

n&uacute;mero de hijos en la escuela.  El pr&eacute;stamo se otorga directamente

al estudiante a una tasa de inter&eacute;s variable y convenientes t&eacute;rminos

de amortizaci&oacute;n.  Los pagos pueden diferirse mientras el estudiante

permanezca matriculado por lo menos a medio tiempo.

<P>



</P></LI>

<LI><B><A HREF="#staffordu">Pr&eacute;stamo Federal Stafford (no subsidiado)</A></B>

- Este pr&eacute;stamo no est&aacute; basado en  la necesidad, y permite a los

estudiantes de todos los niveles de ingresos  activos ser elegibles para un pr&eacute;stamo

a costo reducido.  El inter&eacute;s comienza a acumularse inmediatamente despu&eacute;s

de desembolsarse los fondos, pero el principal puede diferirse mientras el

estudiante permanezca matriculado por lo menos a medio tiempo. Los estudiantes

que prefieren pagar el inter&eacute;s, lo hacen mensualmente. La amortizaci&oacute;n

del principal y el inter&eacute;s no comienza hasta seis meses despu&eacute;s de

la graduaci&oacute;n.

<P>



</P></LI>

<LI><B><A HREF="#fedplus">Pr&eacute;stamo Federal PLUS</A></B> - Pr&eacute;stamo

que no est&aacute; restringido por el ingreso o los activos familiares.  El pr&eacute;stamo

se otorga a los padres o al tutor legal de un estudiante dependiente.  Los pr&eacute;stamos

PLUS ofrecen convenientes t&eacute;rminos de amortizaci&oacute;n y tienen una

tasa de inter&eacute;s variable que se fija annualmente y que nunca superar&aacute;

el 9%.  El inter&eacute;s comienza a acumularse desde el desembolso.

</LI>

<P>

Para ayudarle a seleccionar el mejor pr&eacute;stamo para usted, examine el

siguiente cuadro, luego lea el resumen del proceso de solicitud incluido al

final de este folleto para saber qu&eacute; debe esperarse cuando se sol&iacute;cita

un pr&eacute;stamo para estudiantes.

</P>

<P>



<B>C&oacute;mo y cu&aacute;ndo solicitar un pr&eacute;stamo</B>

</P>

<P>

Comun&iacute;quese con la oficina de ayuda financiera de su escuela o llame a

Signet at 1-800-434-1988 y pida una solicitud gratis para un pr&eacute;stamo

educacional.  NOTA: siempre averig&uuml;e primero los procedimientos de su

escuela - algunas escuelas ofrecen un proceso de solicitud autom&aacute;tico. 

Signet y las oficinas de ayuda financiera de las escuelas aceptan solicitudes

durante todo el a&ntilde;o.  El tiempo de procesamiento var&iacute;a durante los

per&iacute;odos de m&aacute;xima actividad, as&iacute; que conviene presentar la

solicitud a tiempo para asegurar que contar&aacute; con los fondos cuando los

necesite.  Para m&aacute;s detalles v&eacute;ase el proceso de solicitud para

ayuda financiera.

<P>



<B>Otras opciones para pr&eacute;stamos educacionales	</B>

</P>

<P>

Si usted necesita financiamiento educacional adicional, considere una l&iacute;nea

de cr&eacute;dito.  Los propietarios pueden aprovechar los posibles beneficios

impositivos de un pr&eacute;stamo o l&iacute;nea de cr&eacute;dito para

vivienda.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Advantage #1. Experience. <BR></B><BR></FONT> We've been

aiding students and their parents for more than 25 years.  Our combination of

expertise, outstanding service and hard work have made us a major player in the

national student loan field.</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>



<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Advantage #2. We're A National Lender. <BR></B><BR></FONT>

Signet Bank has helped students and parents all across the country get the

student loans they need.  This means you or your child can live or attend school

anywhere in the country.</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>



<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Advantage # 3. No Additional Restrictions. <BR></B><BR></FONT>

Unlike some other lenders, Signet does not place any additional restrictions on

our student loans besides those placed by the U.S. Government. So you don't have

to have a Signet checking or savings account to apply for one of our student

loans.

</P>

<P>



<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Advantage #4. Deferred Repayment. <BR></B><BR></FONT>

Many options are available to help you defer repayment on your student loan.

Most of our loans only require that the student be enrolled at least half-time. 

And depending on the loan amount, you may have up to 10 years to repay.  Student

aid <I>is</I> available.  And at Signet, we can help you find it.  To get your

free student loan kit, call us toll-free at <B>1-800-434-1988 </B>(in

Baltimore, call, 410-332-5709).

</P>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Advantage #5. Repayment Options. <BR></B><BR></FONT>

Signet provides the <B> Federal <A HREF="consol.html"> Consolidation </A> Loan

Program </B> in addition to the <B> <A HREF="repayinf.html">Standard</A>

Repayment Options</B> for each of the loans offered.  This program can make

repaying your loans easier by combining your eligible loans into one monthly

payment.  And depending on the amount you need to consolidate, you may be able

to reduce your monthly payment by repaying your student loans over a longer

period of time.

</P>

<P>

</P>

<HR>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Important Note...</B></FONT> If you already have a

student loan application, you can select Signet as your lender by noting <B>Signet

Bank, lender code #805595</B> on your application.

<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Successful Repayment.<BR></FONT></B></P>

<P>

 Repaying your student loan creates a good credit record that will allow you to

make future purchases like a car or a home.  Know your rights and

responsibilities as a student borrower, and what to do if you run into a

situation that makes repayment difficult.  If you still have questions after

you've read this, contact your lender.

</P>

<P>

</P>

<HR>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>How Much Do I Owe?</B></FONT><BR></P>

<P>

 If you have a Federal Stafford Student Loan (formerly known as Guaranteed

Student Loan), the financial aid representative at your school will reconfirm

the total amount of your loan and will provide you with an estimate of what your

monthly payment will be at an exit interview you'll have shortly before you

leave school.

</P>

<P>

About three months after you've left school, your lender will send you a

repayment schedule listing the total amount you owe, your monthly payment

amount, and the date your first payment is due.  If you've borrowed from several

lenders, you will get a repayment schedule from each of them.

</P>

<P>

If you have a Federal Supplemental Loan for Students (SLS), it may not be

possible to tell in advance exactly how much you'll owe.

</P>

<P>

This is because Federal SLS loans have a &quot;floating&quot; interest rate that

moves up or down with interest rates in the economy.  Therefore, your payment

term or monthly payment amount may change.  For example, if the interest rate

rises, you will repay more; if it falls, you will repay less because you are

paying less in interest.  If you're not clear about what a floating rate means,

please contact your lender.

</P>

<P>

If your parent or guardian obtained a Federal PLUS loan for your education, they

should contact their lender for repayment information.

</P>

<P>

</P>

<HR>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>When Do I Start Repaying My Loan?</B></FONT><BR></P>

<P>

 That depends on what kind of loan you have.  The payment schedule from your

lender will give you the date your first monthly payment is due.  You can expect

all of your payments to be due on the same date each month.

<P>

</P>

<P></P>

<HR>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">How Do I Make My Payments?</FONT></B><BR></P>

<P>

Lenders use different methods.  The most common are coupon booklets and monthly

statements.  Some lenders can also automatically deduct your payment

electronically each month, provided you have a checking or savings account at a

qualifying institution.  Choose the one that's most convenient for you.  Signet

Bank can provide any of these repayment services for you.

</P>

<P>

</P>

<HR>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Will I Always Make My Payments to the Same Bank?</FONT></B><BR></P>

<P>

 Not necessarily.  Sometimes lenders sell a portion of their student loans to

other financial institutions.  They do this so that they can have money

available to make more student loans and for other reasons.  It is not Signet

Bank policy to sell your loans.

</P>

<P>

If  your loan is sold, you will receive a letter giving you full information on

the transaction, including directions for making payments in the future. Selling

your loan does not affect the amount you owe or the terms of repayment. The

institution that buys the loan is always required to honor the original

agreement -- and so, of course, are you.

</P>

<P>

</P>

<HR>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">What If I Want To Make Extra Payments?</FONT></B><BR></P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

With any monthly payment, you can add extra money--in whatever amount you

choose--to reduce the principal of the loan.  Early repayment is smart because

it gets you out of debt faster and means you'll pay less in interest.

</P>

<P>

</P>

<HR>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Can I Combine My Payments?</FONT></B><BR></P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

Yes, even if your loans are with different banks.  There are two methods that

can be used, <B><A HREF="serial.html">serialization</A></B> and 

<B><A HREF="consol.html">consolidation</A></B>.

</P>

<P>

<B><A HREF="serial.html">Serialization</A></B> occurs when you have only <B>one</B>

type of loan (Federal Stafford, Federal SLS etc.) and you find a lender that is

willing to purchase all other loans of that same type and combine them together

into one repayment amount.

</P>

<P>

<B><A HREF="consol.html">Consolidation</A></B> involves loans of different

types (including Federal Stafford, Federal SLS, Federal PLUS, Perkins, Health

Professions, FISL loans and Nursing Student Loans) being purchased and combined,

with the added advantage of lowered monthly payments and extended repayment

periods of up to 30 years.  Talk to your lender and think carefully before

deciding if either option is right for you.

</P>

<P></P>

<HR>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">What Happens If I Can't Make A Payment?</FONT></B><BR></P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

Contact your lender as soon as the problem arises.  Lenders realize that

everyone has financial problems from time to time.  You may be eligible for a

<A HREF="defer.html"><B>deferment or a forbearance</B></A> of your loan.  The

worst thing you can do is simply fail to make a payment without any explanation.

 The lender may then assume you're running out on your obligation and could take

action against you which could ruin your credit record.  You should do

everything you can to <A HREF="default.html"><B>Avoid Default</B></A>.

 Are Your Student Loan Payments Too High?

</P>

<P>

Would You Like One Low <B>Fixed</B> Interest Rate?</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

Would You Like to Write Just One Student Loan Check a Month?</P>

<P>

 </P>

<P>

Is Student Loan Repayment Becoming Unmanageable? 

</P>

<P>

</P>

<HR>

<P>

Signet's Federal  Consolidation Loan Program is designed specifically to ease

the burden of student loan repayment for borrowers with multiple student loans.

Just look at all the benefits of loan consolidation.

</P>

<P>



<B>LOWER MONTHLY PAYMENTS</B><BR>  Depending on the payment plan you select, a

consolidation loan from Signet can save you hundreds of dollars every year

compared to your current student loans.

</P>

<UL>

<LI>The <B>Level Payment Plan</B> lowers your payments, locking in your

interest rate.  Your monthly payment will never change.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>The <B>Graduated Payment Plan </B>locks in your interest rate, lowering

your payments even more.  Your payment will gradually increase over the life of

the loan.

</LI>

</UL>

<P>



<B>ONE CHECK TO WRITE</B><BR>  No matter how many student loans or lenders you

have, when you consolidate them into a Federal Consolidation loan, you only have

one monthly payment -- only one check to write each month.

</P>

<P>

<B>FIXED INTEREST RATE</B><BR>  You'll never have to worry about your interest

rate changing.  Once your rate is determined (we base it on  your current

interest rates and your outstanding balances), it will stay fixed for the entire

term of your loan, even if some of the loans included are variable.

</P>

<P>

<B>NO APPLICATION FEES</B><BR>  Because Signet charges absolutely no

application fees, you can start enjoying the benefits of loan consolidation

immediately.

</P>

<P>

<B>APPLY BY PHONE</B><BR>  Now there are two great ways to take advantage of

this opportunity.  Just <B><A HREF="psorder.html">request </A></B> an

application, or call us at

<B>1-800-434-1988</B> (332-5709 in Baltimore).  A Signet Consolidation Loan

Specialist will be able to answer any questions you may have and can take your

application over the phone.  Then we'll send you a Consolidation Program

Application Kit -- simply complete and sign the forms and we'll do the rest! And

remember, anytime you need us, we're just a phone call away.

</P>

<P>



<B>EASY TO QUALIFY</B><BR>  You are eligible for student loan consolidation if

you meet all of the following criteria:   

</P>

<UL>

<LI>The total outstanding balance you plan to consolidate is at least $7,500.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>The current status of all your student loans is either in the six-month

grace period or in repayment.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>None of your loans are overdue by 90 days or more.  (If so, you may correct

this by bringing these loans up to date.)

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>The loans you are planning to consolidate are of the following types:

<P>

</P><OL>

<LI>Federal Stafford Student Loan (formerly called Guaranteed Student Loan)

</LI>

<LI>Federal SLS (Supplemental Loans for Students; formerly called ALAS;

Auxiliary Loan to Assist Students)

</LI>

<LI>Federal PLUS (Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students)

</LI>

<LI>Federal Perkins Loan (formerly called NDSL Loan; National Direct/Defense

Student Loan)

</LI>

<LI>HPSL (Health Professions Student Loan)

</LI>

<LI>FISL (Federal Insured Student Loan)

</LI>

<LI>NSLP (Nurses Student Loan Program)

</LI>

</OL></LI>

</UL>

<P>



<B>A NOTE FOR MARRIED COUPLES</B>	<BR>  You can combine your student loans

into one single <B>Signet Consolidation Loan</B>.  As long as your combined

student loans meet the $7,500 minimum, you can qualify to combine your separate

payments into one single monthly payment. A married couple may also consolidate

two outstanding federal consolidation loans into a new consolidation loan.

</P>

<P>

<B>A NOTE FOR PARENTS ABOUT PLUS LOANS</B><BR>  You may consolidate multiple

PLUS Loans made for one or more children, as long as the $7,500 minimum is met. 

A parent may also consolidate PLUS Loans made for one or more children with

other eligible federally guaranteed loans for their own educational pursuits.

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+2">What is Loan Serialization?</FONT></I></B><BR></P>

<P> Loan Serialization is the process by which you can combine all your

eligible student loans into one single account, with one monthly payment.

Because it is not a new loan, only a merging of exiting loans, there is <B>no

new promissory note </B> to sign.  The original terms and conditions of your

loans (interest rate, length of payment, eligibility for deferments and

forbearance) will remain in force.

<P></P><IMG SRC="images/banr_bar.jpg">

<P><I><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Why Should I Serialize?</FONT></B></I><BR></P>

<P>

<B>FLEXIBILITY.</B><BR>  The Signet Serialization Program gives you more

flexibility to repay your student loans.  By combining all of your similar

education loans into one convenient, manageable loan, you will increase your

financial control by eliminating the need for multiple checks and multiple

lenders.  And since you will only have to write <I>one </I> check a month, you

can spend less time thinking about your loans and more time doing the things you

want to do.

</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

<B>IT'S  EASY.</B><BR>  The terms and conditions of your loans will not change

and there is no charge to serialize your loans.  If you decide to take advantage

of increased financial flexibility, just complete the simple Request Form and

you will be on your way to <I>one</I> manageable monthly payment.

<B>WE'LL DO THE REST.</B><BR>  Once we receive your Serialization Request

  A default on an educational loan occurs when you fail to repay within the

federal repayment guidelines.  Some consequences of defaulting on your

educational loan(s) are listed here:

</P>

<P>

</P>

<UL>

<LI>Defaulted loans are reported to local and national credit agencies.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>The defaulted loan will remain on your credit rating for as long as seven

years.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>A poor payment record may delay or prevent you from obtaining other types

of credit such as credit cards, mortgages, automobile loans, etc.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>You will be unable to obtain future educational loans and all other federal

student financial aid from any institution.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>You will be ineligible for other types of government loans that may assist

you in the future, such small business loans or federally-subsidized mortgages.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>You will be taken to court or your assets may be attached by the guarantee

agency.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>Involuntary deductions from your salary to repay your educational loans are

authorized if you work for a federal agency.<P>

</P><P>

</P></LI>

<LI>Professional licenses may not be granted or renewed if you are in default

on your student loans, etc.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>Federal and some state income tax refunds will be attached and applied to

the balance of the defaulted loan.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>Increased interest and late charges, court and attorney fees will be added

to the amount you must repay.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>You will be ineligible for deferments once your loan is in default.

<P>

</P></LI>

<LI>Default is avoidable.  It requires careful planning when you make the

decision to borrow, when you make choices about your lifestyle and throughout

the entire repayment period.  Your choices about student loan debt will enable

you to make an educational investment in yourself.  It's your choice.

<P>

<I>Make sure to keep a record of each time you contact your lender or servicer.</I>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/banr_bar.jpg"></CENTER>

<P>

 

<B>What Is Forbearance?</B><BR>

</P>

<P>

It is a general term that covers a number of possibilities:  stopping payments

temporarily, allowing an extension of time for making payments, and decreasing

the amount of each payment.

</P>

<P>

Unlike a deferment, <B>forbearance is not a right.  </B>It is something that

your lender may decide to do for you if you sincerely want to repay your loan,

but have a financial hardship that makes it impossible for you to keep up with

your payments right now.

</P>

<P>

You should also be aware that the government will not pay the interest on your

loan during a period of forbearance.  Interest will continue to be charged and

it will be added to the principal and interest you must repay at the end of the

forbearance period.

</P>

<P>

If you want to request a forbearance, you must contact your lender directly. 

Lenders decide each case individually.  You may be asked to supply financial

records or other materials that prove you have a hardship.

</P>

<P>

</P>

<HR>

<P><B>What Is A Deferment?</B><BR>

</P>

<P>

It is a temporary postponement of your loan payments, lasting anywhere from six

months to three years.  When a deferment ends, you must again begin making your

loan payments.

</P>

<P>

<B>You may be entitled to a deferment if any of the following pertains to you:</B></P>

<P>

<B></B></P>

<P>

<B>First-time borrowers after 7/1/93:</B>

</P>

<P>

</P>

<UL>

<LI>You are enrolled half-time at an eligible school or approved graduate

fellowship program.

</LI>

<LI>You are unemployed.

</LI>

<LI>You are earning below minimum wage or the poverty level, causing economic

hardship.

</LI>

</UL>

<P>

<B>For borrowers who took out loans before 7/1/93, these deferment options are

available:</B>

</P>

<P>

</P>

<P><U></U></P>

<UL><LI>You are enrolled full-time at an eligible school or approved graduate

fellowship program.

</LI>

<LI>You are unemployed.

</LI>

<LI>You are on active duty in the Armed Forces or the National Oceanic and

Atmospheric Administration Corps.

</LI>

<LI>You are participating in an eligible internship program.

</LI>

<LI>You are a full-time volunteer for a tax-exempt organization such as the

Peace Corps, Visa or Action.

</LI>

<LI>You are pregnant, caring for your newborn child or a child you have just

adopted, and have been enrolled at an eligible school during the last six months

for at least half-time.

</LI>

<LI>You are temporarily totally disabled, or you cannot work because you are

caring for a spouse or dependent who is temporarily totally disabled.

</LI>

<LI>You are teaching full-time in a public or private elementary or secondary

school in a teacher shortage area (as determined by the U.S. Department of

Education).

</LI>

<LI>You are an officer in the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health

Service

</LI>

<LI>You are participating in an approved rehabilitation training program.

</LI>

<LI>You took out your first Stafford Student Loan (formerly GSL) after July 1,

1987, you are the mother of a pre-school child, you are entering the work force

after a five-year absence, and you are earning less than $1.00 over the minimum

wage.

</LI>

</UL>

<P>

Being in one of these categories <B> does not </B>mean you must take a

deferment; it only means you <B>might </B> be entitled to one if you want it.

You could certainly choose to continue repaying your student loan, even before

deferment ends--and it is probably better to do that so you can get out of debt

more quickly.

needs. Please also consider taking a look at our cash management products
to give your checking account even more of a custom fit. It may take a little
more time to choose a checking account this way, but the end result will
be one that works best for you. </P>

help a small business maximize cash inflows, control cash outflows, or just

tasks, thus increasing the time you have to spend on the business itself. </P>

<B>THE BUSINESS PLAN - WHAT IT INCLUDES:</B></P>
<P>What goes in a business plan? This is an excellent question to ask. And,
one that many new and potential small business owners should ask, but oftentimes
don't ask. The body of the business plan can be divided into four distinct
sections: 
<DL>
<DD>1) the description of the business
<DD>2) <A HREF="#marketingplan">the marketing plan</A>
<DD>3) <A HREF="#financialplan">the financial management plan</A>
<DD>4) <A HREF="#managementplan">the management plan</A>
</DL>
<P>Addenda to the business plan should include the executive summary, supporting
documents and financial projections. </P>
<P><B>Business Plan Outline</B>- Below is an outline for a business plan. Use this model as a guide when
developing the business plan for your franchise or business. </P>
<P>Elements of a Business Plan 
<OL>
<LI>Cover sheet 
<LI>Statement of purpose 
<LI>Table of contents
</OL>
<P>I. The Business<DL>
<DD>A. Description of business

<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Detail by month first year 
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Detail by quarters, second and third years 
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Assumptions upon which projections were based 
<DD>F. Pro-forma cash flow 
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Follow guidelines for letter E. </DL>
<P>III. Supporting Documents <DL>
<DD>- Tax returns of principals for last three years 
<DD>- Personal financial statement (all banks have these forms) 
<DD>- Copy of franchise contract and all supporting documents provided by the
franchisor 
<DD>- Copy of proposed lease of purchase agreement for building space 
<DD>- Copy of licenses and other legal documents 
<DD>- Copy of resumes of all principals 
<DD>- Copies of letters of intent from suppliers, etc. </DL>
<P><B><A NAME="marketingplan">The Marketing Plan</A>-</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing plays a vital role in successful business ventures. How well you
market your business, along with a few other considerations, will ultimately
determine your degree of success or failure. The key element of a successful
marketing plan is to know your customers -- their likes, dislikes, expectations.
By identifying these factors, you can develop a marketing strategy that
will allow you to arouse and fulfill their needs. Identify your customers
by their age, sex, income/educational level and residence. At first, target
only those customers who are more likely to purchase your product or service.
As your customer base expands, you may need to consider modifying the marketing
plan to include other customers. Develop a marketing plan for your business
venture by answering these questions. Potential franchise owners will have
to use the marketing strategy the franchisor has developed; however, it
should be included in your business plan and contain answers to the questions
outlined below. 
<UL>
<LI>Who are your customers? Define your target market(s). 
<LI>Are your markets growing? steady? declining? 
<LI>Are your markets large enough to expand? 
<LI>How will you attract, hold, increase your market share?  
</UL>
<P><B><A NAME="financialplan">The Financial Management</B> <B>Plan</A>-</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound financial management is one of the best ways for your business to
remain profitable and solvent. How well you manage the finances of your
business is the cornerstone of every successful business venture. Each year
thousands of potentially successful businesses fail because of poor financial
management. As a business owner, you will need to identify and implement
policies that will lead to and ensure that you will meet your financial
obligations. To effectively manage your finances, plan a sound, realistic
budget by determining the actual amount of money needed to open your franchise
(start-up costs) and the amount needed to keep it open (operating costs).</P>
<P>The first step to building a sound financial plan is to devise a start-up
budget. Your start-up budget will usually include such one-time-only costs
as major equipment, utility deposits, down payments, etc. The start-up budget
should allow for these expenses. </P>
<P>Start-up Budget:
<UL>
<LI>personnel (costs prior to opening)
<LI>legal/professional fees 
<LI>occupancy 
<LI>licenses/permits 
<LI>equipment 
<LI>insurance 
<LI>supplies 
<LI>advertising/promotions 
<LI>salaries/wages 
<LI>accounting 
<LI>income 
<LI>utilities
<LI>payroll expenses 
</UL>
<P>An operating budget is prepared when you are actually ready to open for
business. The operating budget will reflect your priorities in terms of
how your spend your money, the expenses you will incur and how you will
meet those expenses (income). Your operating budget also should include
money to cover the first three to six months of operation. It should allow
for the following expenses. </P>
<P>Operating Budget:
<UL>
<LI>personnel 
<LI>insurance 
<LI>rent 
<LI>depreciation 
<LI>loan payments 
<LI>advertising/promotions 
<LI>legal/accounting 
<LI>miscellaneous expenses 
<LI>supplies 
<LI>payroll expenses 
<LI>salaries/wages 
<LI>utilities 
<LI>dues/subscriptions/fees 
<LI>taxes 
<LI>repairs/maintenance 
</UL>
<P>The financial section of your business plan should include:
<UL>
<LI>any loan applications you've filed
<LI>a capital equipment and supply list
<LI>balance sheet
<LI>breakeven analysis
<LI>pro-forma income projections (profit and loss statement)
<LI>pro-forma cash flow. 
</UL>
<P>The income statement and cash flow projections should include a three-year
summary, detail by month for the first year, and detail by quarter for the
second and third years. </P>
<P>The accounting system and the inventory control system that you will be
using is generally addressed in this section of the business plan also.
Whether you develop the accounting and inventory systems yourself, have
an outside financial advisor develop the systems or the franchisor provides
these systems, you will need to acquire a thorough understanding of each
and how it operates. Questions that you will need to consider are:
<UL>
<LI>What type of accounting system will you use? Is it a single entry or dual
entry system? 
<LI>What will your sales goals and profit goals for the coming year be? 
<LI>What financial projections will you need to include in your business plan? 
<LI>What kind of inventory control system will you use? 
</UL>
<P>Your plan should include an explanation of all projections. Unless you are
thoroughly familiar with financial statements, get help in preparing your
cash flow and income statements and your balance sheet. Your aim is not
to become a financial wizard, but to understand the financial tools well
enough to gain their benefits. Your accountant or financial advisor can
help you accomplish this goal. For a detailed explanation of these and other
more complex financial concepts, contact your local SBA Office. Look under
the U.S. Government section of the local telephone directory. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="managementplan">The Management Plan</A>-</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managing a business requires more than just the desire to be your own boss.
It demands dedication, persistence, the ability to make decisions and the
ability to manage both employees and finances. Your management plan, along
with your marketing and financial management plans, sets the foundation
for and facilitates the success of your business. Like plants and equipment,
people are resources -- they are the most valuable asset a business has.
You will soon discover that employees and staff will play an important role
in the total operation of your enterprise. Consequently, it's imperative
that you know what skills you possess and those you lack since you will
have to hire personnel to supply the skills that you lack. Additionally,
it is imperative that you know how to manage and treat your employees. Make
them a part of the team. Keep them informed of, and get their feedback regarding,
changes. Employees oftentimes have excellent ideas that can lead to new
market areas, innovations to existing products or services or new product
lines or services which can improve your overall competitiveness. Your management
plan should answer questions such as: 
<UL>
<LI> How does your background/business experience help you in this business? 
<LI>What are your weaknesses and how can you compensate for them? 
<LI>Who will be on the management team? 
<LI>What are their strengths/weaknesses? 
<LI>What are their duties? 
<LI>Are these duties clearly defined? 
<LI>What are your current personnel needs? 
<LI>What are your plans for hiring and training personnel? 
<LI>What salaries, benefits, vacations, holidays will you offer? 
</UL>

<h2>Signet Banking Corporation Facts, History and Highlights</h2><p><font size=+1>	Signet Banking Corporation is a $11 billion financial services organization that offers a wide array of financial products through its Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking and Capital Markets divisions. The corporation is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SBK."<p>	Signet traces its roots back to 1795 as the Bank of Baltimore in Maryland, making it the 8th oldest bank in the U.S.  The predecessor of the parent company was founded in 1922 as the Morris Plan Bank of Richmond and was one of the first banks to offer installment loan credit to average individuals.
<p><A HREF="1970s.mov"><IMG align=right SRC="images/1970pic3.gif" ALT="1970s Movie File"></A>
Signet (then Bank of Virginia) was the first bank in the country to sign up with a new way to pay for purchases in 1953 -- MasterCharge, now MasterCard International.  Signet has been a leader in technology in the banking industry and was one of the first banks to bring the ATM to Virginia and Maryland.  Signet is also one of a handful of banks in the nation to process checks using image technology.  And Signet was the first U.S. bank to establish a comprehensive site for <A HREF="http://www.signet.com/collegemoney">college financing information</a> on the World Wide Web.
<p> 
	Headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, Signet has a <a href="http://www.signet.com/perfinance/branch.htm">branch</a> and <a href="http://www.signet.com/perfinance/atmlocator.htm">ATM</a> network throughout Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia, and customers nationwide. The company is expanding its offices and market presence across the nation, with a mutual fund marketing group in Vermont and New York, mortgage offices in North Carolina and Tennessee and other extension offices in Georgia, Texas, California, and Pennsylvania. The recent national roll-out of consumer loan products has brought customers to Signet from every state. 
<p>
<A HREF="distirel.mov"><IMG align=left SRC="images/distpic3.gif" ALT="Distance Irrelevant Movie"></A>Signet uses a strategy known as <a href="http://jerome.signet.com/hr/ibdm.html">Information-Based Decision Making (IBDM)</a> to target financial products to people most likely to purchase them.  Products and services are customized and refined for groups based on a series of results from statistical models using credit bureau and other available data.<p>IBDM made possible the rapid growth and ultimate spin-off of most of Signet's credit card business, now known as Capital One Financial Corp.  IBDM is at use throughout Signet, from commercial products and services to deposit and credit products for consumers.<p><p>

<h1 align=left><em>a personal note</em>
<h1 align=center><em>   from the chairman</em></h1>
<p>
<font size =+5>I</font><font size=+1>n 1995, I announced my decision to retire. The 25 years I have spent with Signet have been greatly rewarding. It is time now for me to devote more hours to my family, and to pursue the personal activities that I enjoy.
<p>
When I became chairman, I wanted to ensure that Signet's legacy of creativity and innovation continued to flourish. In May, I will hand the responsibilities of leadership to my colleague and friend, Mac McDonald, who shares that vision and has worked closely with me over the past 16 years guiding the bank.I have never been more confident about the company's ability to prosper. Signet is in excellent shape and Mac is a superb leader surrounded by an experienced, accomplished management team.
<p>
The financial services industry has been exciting and challenging, and my team's ability to grow the business has been a source of great personal satisfaction. I am proud of my years with Signet and look forward to participating as a board member in its continued success. 
<p>
Sincerely<BR>
Bob Freeman

<h1 align=left><em>a company in</em>
<h1 align=center><em>   forward motion</em></h1>
<p>
<font size =+5>S</font><font size=+1>ignet is a financial services company built on a tradition of implementing innovative strategies. Since its inception as a Morris Plan Bank in 1922, our company often has diverged from mainstream banking and led the way in developing new products, exploring new delivery channels and creatively managing the challenges that have faced the industry. Never before has this philosophy been as clearly demonstrated as in 1995, when we totally revitalized our business and spun off our highly successful credit card division as an independent company. 
<p>
Our plan to grow, generate revenue and build premium shareholder value is based on sophisticated information strategies. In our businesses and operations, we gather information, develop hypotheses, test them, re-test them, build models based on the information gathered and then continue to test until we believe we have unearthed an insight that will result in success. Information strategies are not simply concepts here; they permeate the company and are practiced in each of our business areas. 
<p>
Until recently, our market area was considered to be <a href="http://www.signet.com/perfinance/branch.htm">where our branches are located: </a> the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. In 1994, we aggressively began to expand our consumer and commercial businesses nationally through the implementation of new business sites, alternative delivery channels and enhanced technology. Instead of pursuing branch banking acquisitions, we have chosen to focus on companies that complement our business strategies. For example, in 1995, we purchased the Blanchard mutual fund group to gain additional insight in its area of expertise -- national direct-response marketing of investment products. <a href="mgmt.htm">Click here </a> to find a description of how Signet is managed. </font><BR>

<HEAD><TITLE>1995 Signet Annual Report -- Letter to Shareholders</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BACKGROUND="images/yellow_w.gif" TEXT="#400040" LINK="#004000" VLINK="#808080" ALINK="#004000">
<H1 align=center><em>letter to shareholders</h1></em><BR>
<font size=+1>To Our Shareholders:</font>
<p>
<font size=+5>N</font><font size=+1>ineteen ninety-five was a very important year for your company. During the year, we completed the spin-off of our credit card business to shareholders and advanced closer to our goal of transforming Signet into a nationwide marketer of select consumer and middle market business products. Subsequent to year-end, we suffered a difficult setback when, in March, we learned that our commercial business was the target of an elaborate fraud scheme. Based on information currently available regarding recoveries, we have adjusted our 1995 results to reflect a pre-tax charge of $35 million, or $.38 per share.  
<p>
Signet Banking Corporation earned $111.1 million, or $1.86 per share, in 1995, compared with reported earnings of $149.8 million, or $2.59 per share, in 1994. Reported results for 1994 and the first two months of 1995 included restructuring charges as well as the earnings of Capital One Financial Corporation which was spun off to shareholders on February 28, 1995. Signet's pro forma net income, excluding Capital One, rose 71 percent to $95.6 million from $55.8 million in 1994. 
<p>
Earnings per share were $1.60 in 1995, up 65 percent from $.97 in the prior year. On the same basis, fourth quarter net income amounted to $9.0 million, or $.15 per share, in 1995, compared with $17.6 million, or $.31 per share, in 1994. When we embarked on our plans for spinning off Capital One and reshaping Signet, we set aggressive performance objectives for 1995. We are pleased to say that we met or exceeded those benchmarks and look forward to continued improvements in 1996. Excluding Capital One and the commercial fraud loss, the return on equity for the year approached 15 percent compared with a running rate of about 10 percent in 1994, and by the fourth quarter, the efficiency ratio had improved 14 percentage points to 63 percent. Growth in target businesses has been vigorous, and we continue to gain confidence in our information-based strategies.
<p>
In 1995, average managed loans (balance sheet and securitized assets) on a pro forma basis grew at an annual rate of 26 percent. Student, installment and home equity loans fueled the growth in the consumer loan portfolio during the year. Average assets in that portfolio of $2.5 billion rose 42 percent over 1994. Focused marketing in specialty segments and leasing accounted for most of the growth in the commercial loan portfolio, which increased $485 million, or 23 percent, in 1995. We continued to narrow the scope of commercial real estate lending activities and as a result, related average loans declined 16 percent to $677 million from 1994.	
<p>
We are dedicating substantial resources to building the infrastructure to support marketing programs for our products and services. In addition to refining branch delivery, we are exploring innovative ways to meet customer needs through the expertise of a targeted sales force and the use of direct mail, telephone banking and on-line services. We now successfully market many of our products and services nationally. These include mutual funds, leasing products, financing for government contractors and smaller media communications companies, student loans and, most recently, consumer installment loans. After two years of extensive testing, we began a phased roll-out of our Loan-by-Check product late in 1995. We urge you to read this report in its entirety to gain a deeper understanding of our strategy and the many initiatives underway throughout the company.  
<p>
<IMG align=right  SRC="images/bob_mac" ALT="Freeman/McDonald Picture">
We must emphasize our commitment to maintaining strong asset quality as we pursue growth opportunities. At the end of 1995, non-performing assets were $54 million, or 1 percent of loans and foreclosed properties. The financial services industry has been experiencing historically low levels of non-performing assets for the past few years, and it would be imprudent to suppose that we are immune to future credit deterioration. At year-end, the allowance for loan losses was 2.4 times non-performing assets and 2.4 percent of loans.
<p>
On a pro forma basis, total annual revenues (net interest income and non-interest income) were $664 million, an increase of 22 percent from 1994. Managing costs in a time of vigorous growth is very difficult, and we were extremely pleased that the level of expenses remained unchanged during the year. This year, despite significantly increasing our investments in research and development, we expect the rate of growth in revenues will continue to outpace increases in expenses.
<p>
 Recognizing these improvements and citing its confidence in our growth plans, on October 20, 1995, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend by 3 cents from the previous rate of $.17 per share. The investment community also responded favorably to our performance. Shareholders who owned Signet stock throughout 1995 earned a 70 percent annual return on their investment in the form of cash dividends and the price appreciation of Signet shares and the Capital One distribution. <p>
Our future is bright. We have the management team in place to lead Signet into the next century and we are confident that our people have the creativity, energy and skills to ensure Signet's excellent performance in the years to come.
<p>

<p>
<font size =+5>T</font><font size=+1>o sustain high performance, we are creating an environment in which change is a constant, failure is a necessary factor of success, calculated risk is desired and a balance exists between the use of intuition and the use of information to make strategic decisions. We have begun to alter our culture by building an environment that engenders new thought and a fresh approach to producing, delivering and selling financial services." <EM>Bob Freeman, chairman and chief executive officer</EM>
<p>
 Signet always has been forward-thinking, often pursuing unconventional directions that have enabled us to stay one step ahead of the competition. This practice is best exemplified by our heavy investment in 1988 in a concept we refer to as "information-based strategies." Our investment ultimately led to the phenomenal success of the credit card business and our subsequent decision to spin it off to shareholders. As a result of following an unconventional path, both Capital One Financial Corporation, the new, independent credit card company, and Signet are creating premium returns for shareholders. 
<p><align=absmiddle><IMG align=right SRC="images/meek2" ALT="Gary Klein, Leslie Meek, Janet Perlowski">
<STRONG>Using Science in Business</STRONG>
<p>
As the potential for our credit card division became evident, we began to use information strategies in other businesses within Signet. Through a process we refer to as the "information loop," we apply scientific reasoning to business practices and systematically test in order to gain insights that create competitive advantage. We start with an hypothesis, test it, incubate the results, analyze the data and incorporate the findings into our models and processes. 
<p>
We use statistical methods to examine all the variables that ultimately go into developing a product, marketing strategy or business practice. We use tests to build response rate models, enhance product design, determine optimal delivery channels, evaluate risk or reduce operational stress points. In each case, a test consists of varying product offers that lead to insights that form a rich data pool. 
<p>
The principle of continuous testing is crucial for developing competitive advantage. Over time, several iterations around the information loop lead to insights that cannot easily be replicated by competitors who have not gone through each step of the learning cycle.
<p>
While the best and most powerful examples of information strategies are evident in consumer lending, where the law of large numbers applies, we use the same approach throughout Signet. A simple example is the use of information to build staffing models for our branches and support divisions. Credit risk management is a more complex example in which information techniques involve identifying patterns for projecting losses and delinquencies (according to historical trends and current behavior), economic stress testing and monitoring portfolios that enable us to predict customer behavior.

<h1 align=left><em>new ideas and a fresh approach</em></h1>
<p>
<font size=+5>W</font><font size=+1>e were skeptical about information-based strategies when we first started talking seriously about them. We struggled with how to apply them in our business. Now, through highly sophisticated analysis of our trading activity, we can predict the magnitude of our daily risk and return. When the chairman asks, 'What is the overall trading position?' we can say with 98% statistical confidence what our daily fluctuations will be." <EM>Sandy Teu, executive vice president, Capital Markets</EM><BR>|
<p>
<ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE> <IMG align=right SRC="images/gaylon2" ALT="Gaylon Layfield Picture">
In theory, the information loop seems simple to execute. In practice, however, it requires an enormous commitment from the organization and its employees. "We had to start thinking about things differently. Our management committee is now doing a better job of integrating economic scenarios and sociological and geographic trends into our analysis. We're improving our strategic discussions and becoming much more diligent in implementing the details of our plan through a very disciplined project management and evaluation process." <EM>Gaylon Layfield, officer in charge (OIC) Consumer Banking</EM>
<p>
Over the past few years, we have begun to alter our culture to position the company for long-term success. "There is clearly an openness to new ideas and a fresh approach at Signet. We are encouraged to work together to find facts and information, to balance what we've found with intuition and to pursue a course of action that will help us gain additional insight. We clearly operate under a 'try it and see' approach." <EM>Alastair Ironside, vice president, Consumer Banking</EM>
<p>
"This is a time of great discovery at Signet. People at all levels of the organization share a genuine desire to challenge conventional ways of thinking about financial services. When I talk with peers at other companies, I am reminded of how dynamic our culture has become. The courage to experiment makes all the difference." <EM>Mary Vogan, senior vice president, Capital Markets</EM>
<p>
 Information strategies have both breadth and depth at Signet. They permeate our company at every level."Signet has very clearly stated its strategy and that strategy is communicated better than I've seen in other organizations. Everyone here knows about information-based decision making and understands its importance. In fact, I've found that we even use a common dialogue when discussing our strategies with one another. This company is very thoroughly aligned." <EM>Leslie Cohoon, senior vice president, Information Technology & Services</EM>
<p>
"The culture at Signet supports rapid innovation and change. Can you imagine that in little over a year's time this company has spun off a major portion of the business, totally reinvented the core bank, achieved an improved return on equity, erected a $55 million operations center and made significant investments in information-based strategies? I'd call that pretty remarkable, and it speaks to the will of the organization and its strength." <EM>Bob DeAngelis, senior vice president, Information Technology & Services

<h1 align=left><em>investing in intellectual capital and technology</em></h1>
<p>
<font size=+5>T</font><font size=+1>o support the new dynamics at Signet, many organizational changes were made in 1995. Employees were encouraged to consider the company's future direction and to make personal choices about whether they shared the common vision. We took steps to match the right individuals with the right positions with an eye toward diversifying talent throughout the organization. In addition, we invested in intellectual capital through extensive training and hiring the best and brightest from a national pool of candidates. <BR>
<p>
"The future of our company depends on our individual and collective ability to choose to do what we care about, not what others think we should do. We are creating an environment in which people feel engaged in their jobs." <EM>Philip Davidson, OIC Strategic Leadership</EM><BR>
<p>
<ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE> <IMG align=right SRC="images/taylor2" ALT="Taylor, Cohoon, DeAngelis Picture">
"We are attracting and promoting extremely talented people who get to play an integral role in Signet's future. People stay at Signet because of the excitement and the promise of creating something big." <EM>Nat Taylor, OIC Human Resources</EM><BR>
<p>
 Innovative thinking combined with the best use of technology helps us gain insights from the information we gather. In addition to investing in intellectual capital, we will continue to invest significantly in technology to support our primary goals: promoting quality customer service, developing and refining the most intelligent vehicles for marketing, managing risk and delivering products and services. Technology has eliminated many cumbersome processes and procedures that used to alienate customers and frustrate our employees. By working smarter, automating processes and using advanced technology, we increased capacity with fewer employees. This has resulted in cost savings and efficiencies throughout the company. <BR>
<p>
<STRONG><em>Competing on a Different Level</STRONG></em>
<p>
"Our view of the future for our industry clearly indicates that to compete we can no longer measure our success against traditional banks. We must measure our success against the many companies now offering financial products -- the AT&Ts, USAAs and T. Rowe Prices of the world -- that are fast becoming the best in the business."<EM> Mac McDonald, president and chief operating officer</EM><BR>
<p>
Non-banks have attracted financial services customers through convenient delivery channels, top-quality service, outstanding marketing programs and improved products. Our competitive analysis now centers on understanding and analyzing best practices of all competitors. This is a dramatic change in the way we measure the success of our businesses.

<h1 align=left><em>capturing profitable business</em></h1>
<p>
<font size=+5>"M</font><font size=+1>any of our more traditional competitors are clinging to the past. One analogy I can think of is historical ...when the railroads kept a narrow focus of their business instead of viewing it as the transportation business. We're not afraid to break away from the pack and try new things." <EM>Janet Perlowski, senior vice president, Controller's</EM>
<p>
"Traditional banks think the way to profitability is to create the greatest volume of products and attract the greatest number of customers. We have learned that an increase in volume does not necessarily equate to an increase in profitability. We believe in using information to selectively match products with customers to generate the greatest returns." <EM>Sara Wilson, General Counsel</EM>
<p><ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE> <IMG align=right  SRC="images/millner2" ALT="B. Millner Picture">
One of the most striking differences between Signet and others in the banking industry is our acquisition philosophy. While our existing branch network continues to play a vital role in our sales, servicing and delivery process, we don't think there is tremendous leverage in adding to this network.
<p>
"We think branch network acquisitions, for the most part, are priced so that the value goes to the sellers, not the buyers. While the buyers may realize some short-term gains from cost cutting, in the long run they still need to find new ways to grow revenues."<EM> B. Millner, chief financial officer</EM>
<p>
We believe there is greater value in pursuing alliances that enhance our strategies. For example, we acquired Sheffield Management Company and Sheffield Investments, Inc. (the managers and distributors of Blanchard mutual funds) to gain additional expertise in direct-response marketing of investment products.
<p>
<STRONG><EM>Understanding Profitability</EM></STRONG>
<p>
"Financial services companies have not traditionally been leaders in identifying profit components of products, nor have they been leaders in figuring out which customers are profitable. It's our philosophy that by learning more about profit both at the product and customer levels, we will be better able to allocate resources and to identify which customer segments we should target." <EM>Beth Gibson, senior vice president, Financial Management Information</EM>
<p>
 In 1995, we began the Management Analysis and Reporting System (MARS) project to provide a framework for multiple views of profitability by product, by customer account, by business unit and any combination thereof. MARS will enable us to provide highly accurate forecasts of net interest income and of interest rate risk, so that the potential profitability of different strategies can be explored in-depth.
<p>
"Through integrated information systems, we will be able to capture the economics of our business, to improve our understanding and measurement of risk, and to predict how certain behaviors impact our internal economics -- how delivery costs affect the net present value of a particular project, for instance. We will be able to understand and make decisions about profitability at the customer level."<BR><EM> Gary Klein, executive vice president, Consumer Banking

<h1 align=left><em>pursuing alternative delivery channels</em></h1>
<p>
<font size=+5>"W</font><font size=+1>e believe Signet is well ahead of the pack in advancing the concept of pricing on a customer-by-customer basis. MARS will give us the insights needed to offer customers the right price, at the right risk and profit level for us." <EM>Gene Childs, vice president, Financial Management Information</EM>
<p>
<EM><STRONG>Defining Markets</STRONG></EM>
<p>
The success we have experienced with information strategies has enabled us to think about Signet's future much differently. <p>
"Most banking institutions are trapped, I think, in the whole concept of 'what is a market.' They believe their markets consist of the area just around their branches. The fact is we now think of our market as the whole nation, and potentially even the world. Technology is advancing at such a rate that new possibilities are opening up in terms of who our customers are, where they are and how we can reach them." <EM>Bob Freeman, chairman and chief executive officer</EM>
<p>
"Technology has made distance irrelevant in terms of delivering commercial banking services or even calling on customers." <EM>Jack McKenney, executive vice president, Commercial Banking</EM>
<p>
"Our customers import and export their products all over the world. Using global cash management services and international trade expertise, we help them move funds or handle payments in Indonesia, Brazil, Europe, anywhere. Understanding the importance of convenience in today's marketplace, we use technology to enable our customers to serve their clients." <EM>Leslie Meek, vice president, International Banking</EM>
<p>
 Signet is exploring a variety of alternative delivery channels and marketing practices. Recent examples include:
<ul>
<li>	Allying with Edify, Intuit and Microsoft for future on-line banking. <BR>
<li>	Establishing a relationship with CompuServe to offer mutual funds to its customer base.<BR>
<li>	Installing a new voice response unit and auto call distribution system to improve our telebanking service.<BR>
<li>	Mailing solicitations (over 13 million in 1995 and 34 million expected in 1996) nationwide offering customers products like personal loans, small business loans, checking accounts, home equity accounts and commercial leasing accounts.<BR>
<li>	Creating for business customers new, interactive account management programs using advanced imaging technology.
<li>	Establishing mortgage origination teams in 11 states.
<li>	Offering commercial banking expertise to businesses nationwide through electronic information sharing and a more mobile sales force. 
<li>	Transferring funds world-wide in dollars or foreign currency via on-line banking. 	
</ul>

<p>
<font size =+5>"T</font><font size=+1>raditional banks think about introducing a handful of products into the marketplace each year. They roll out products with a single price, a single positioning and an ad campaign. We try to think about this in a different way. Instead of trying a handful, we try thousands of price, feature, positioning and direct mail copy combinations a year. By increasing the number of times at bat, we increase our likelihood of finding a successful combination that we can broadly roll out in the marketplace." <EM>Chris Oddleifson, executive vice president, Consumer Banking</EM>
<p><align=absmiddle><IMG align=right SRC="images/ironsid3.jpg" ALT="Ironside/Oddleifson Picture">
A good example of this practice is our direct response "Loan-by-Check" program. We began testing this consumer loan product more than two years ago by gathering response and risk data relative to a number of different pricing and packaging offers. By late 1995, we had built the first generation proprietary model that we used for sending targeted mailings nationally. We are very enthused with the insights gathered about this product, and believe we will be able to increase the "Loan-by-Check" portfolio significantly in 1996. 
<p>
<EM><STRONG>Choosing Businesses to Pursue</STRONG></EM><BR>
Bricks and mortar are no longer a constraint. Regions are no longer a constraint. Our goal is to leverage product offerings into lucrative market segments we have identified on a national scale. We have solutions that provide enough value for a company in Oregon to desire to do business with Signet." <EM>Ken Trout, OIC Commercial Banking</EM>
<p>
"We're unique in the market. Our competition is very much mass-market oriented with a philosophy of  'build it and they will come.' We identify segments we think we can support best, and ask the customers in those segments what they want. Then we build the products and services and deliver them to our customers." <EM>Anne O'Toole, vice president, Commercial Banking</EM> 
<p>
The businesses we emphasize share certain traits: they have high risk-adjusted returns over the life of the asset, relatively low fixed costs and are in markets that are growing or highly fragmented. Of course, everyone looks for businesses with these characteristics. We, however, are making sizable investments in a strategy that can selectively exploit these attributes for sustained profitability. Identifying the business is just the first step. We then consider the relative opportunities the business presents: Does it have the potential for nationwide marketing? What are the possible delivery channels? What are the product characteristics? Can we act upon customer behaviors that affect profitability? What are the risk components? These questions define areas where information strategies add leverage to generate premium returns for shareholders.

<p>
<font size =+5>"I</font><font size=+1>n our Fixed Income Sales and Trading area, we are using information to analyze industries, identify and qualify prospects, and manage accounts. Everyone in our division has access to information needed for making reasonable, well-informed decisions. It's not a situation where management has it and no one else does." <EM>Sandy Teu, executive vice president, Capital Markets</EM>
<p><alogn=absmiddle><IMG align=right SRC="images/teuvogn2.jpg" ALT="Sandy Teu and Mary Vogan Picture">
Intellectual capital, technology, profitability, multiple delivery channels and new product development all come together for the benefit of customers. For example, our Commercial Banking and Information Technology & Services divisions are working together to deliver customized products and services that support the day-to-day management of our clients' businesses. In the commercial middle market area, we are focusing on lease financing and specialty segments like media communications companies (publishers, newspapers, television stations) and government contract lending. 
<p>
We use information strategies to provide select customers with value-added expertise. For example, we use information to find the most attractive leasing prospects from a national universe of more than 200,000 companies. We overlay a variety of data sources and build models to determine which companies our officers should contact to improve the success rate of their calls. In our media specialty business, we've built very sophisticated models to predict cash flows from intangible media assets. In government contract lending, we are building financial models that will complement the intuitive expertise gained through 25 years of working with customers in this field. Since we have come to understand more about profitability in all of our businesses, we are able to price our products to earn healthy returns on high quality assets. 
<p>
<EM><STRONG>Competitive Flexibility</STRONG></EM><BR>
We are moving away from businesses and products that don't meet our risk and return criteria, or where we don't think we can develop sustainable competitive advantage. For instance, the boom and bust cycle, typical of the banking industry and most recently illustrated by the real estate collapse in the late '80s and early '90s, is one we don't care to repeat.
<p>
"Throughout 1995, we continued to de-emphasize our participation in more speculative, high risk real estate transactions. We are concerned with the volatility of returns over the business cycle, and we don't think these transactions offer the best use of our capital." <EM>Mac McDonald, president and chief operating officer </EM>

<p>
<font size =+5>"W</font><font size=+1>e are working toward an alignment of our credit culture with our growth goals. We won't lend just to grow market share." <EM>Bob Merrick, OIC Credit Management</EM>
<p>
Competition in the commercial lending industry can lead to pricing practices and risk that often conflict with Signet's profitability standards. We are not concerned, therefore, with becoming the biggest lender in our markets. Instead, our lending goals are tied to maintaining good customer relationships and identifying new opportunities that present the best match of our business expertise with our clients' needs at acceptable returns.
<p><align=absmiddle><IMG align=right SRC="images/otoole2" ALT="Anne O'Toole and Jack McKenney Picture">
"We no longer are in the game of garnering the largest market share. We would suggest this strategy dilutes profitability over time because being all things to all people brings you back to an average. Instead, we have defined markets in which we want to be very important players. We don't want to be average, we want to be excellent." <EM>Jack McKenney, executive vice president, Commercial Banking</EM>
<p>
Small business and middle market lending are examples of areas in which we are generating profitable growth. We have established a centralized loan center that uses many of the techniques commonly employed by credit card companies to originate, score, process and manage accounts. As a result, we can make decisions quickly while adhering to prudent credit risk principles. 
<p>
<EM><STRONG>Moving Forward</STRONG></EM><BR>
We are pleased with the advances Signet made in 1995, and we are very optimistic about what the future holds. We emphasize capital strength, liquidity and soundness so that we can venture into new opportunities with minimum risk. We closely analyze Signet's businesses to ensure they meet our vision for the future and explore ways to make our operations more efficient.Instead of simply reacting to the changes that are shaping the financial services industry, we are creating our own future by discovering new and varied ways to produce premium value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. We are moving forward.

<p>
<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>
<p>
<font size=+5>S</font><font size=+1>ignet Banking Corporation ("Signet" or "the Company"), with headquarters in Richmond, Virginia, is a registered multi-bank, multi-state holding company whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SBK. At December 31, 1995, Signet had assets of approximately $11.0 billion and provided interstate financial services through two principal subsidiaries: Signet Bank (which resulted from the merger of Signet Bank/Virginia and Signet Bank/Maryland in 1995) headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and Signet Bank N.A., headquartered in Washington, D.C. The Company is in the process of merging Signet Bank N. A. into Signet Bank and expects to complete the combination of the two banks during 1996.
<p>
Signet engages in general commercial and consumer banking businesses and provides a full range of financial services to individuals, businesses and organizations through 244 banking offices, 253 automated teller machines and a 24-hour full-service Telephone Banking Center. Signet offers investment services including municipal bond, government, federal agency and money market sales and trading, foreign exchange trading, mutual funds and discount brokerage. In addition, specialized services for trust, leasing, asset based lending, cash management, real estate, insurance, consumer financing and trade finance are offered. Signet's primary market area extends from Baltimore to Washington, south to Richmond, and on to Hampton Roads/Tidewater, Virginia. The Company also markets several of its products nationally.
<p>
On November 22, 1994, Signet transferred certain designated assets and liabilities of Signet Bank's credit card division to Capital One Bank, a newly chartered limited purpose credit card bank. Capital One Bank became, in conjunction with the transfer, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Capital One Financial Corporation ("Capital One"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Signet (the "Separation"). As part of the Separation, Signet Bank retained a small portfolio of in-market credit card loans. At the same time 7,125,000 shares of common stock of Capital One were sold in an initial public offering. Signet distributed all of the remaining Capital One common stock it held to Signet stockholders in a tax-free distribution on February 28, 1995 (the "spin-off"). Related assets of $3.6 billion and equity of $0.4 billion were spun off at this time. The spin-off enhanced shareholder value by creating two independent financial institutions, each possessing substantial financial and managerial strength and each pursuing separate and attractive long-term business strategies.
<p>
In 1994, Signet also announced a comprehensive program to improve the performance of its core banking businesses through initiatives to reduce costs and enhance revenues. In connection with the spin-off and the cost reduction measures, Signet recorded special pre-tax charges of $92.2 million for restructuring ($43.2 million) and for terminating certain data processing contracts ($49.0 million).
<p>
During the third quarter of 1994, the Company acquired Pioneer Financial Corporation ("Pioneer"), the parent company of Pioneer Federal Savings Bank, a $400 million financial institution located in Chester, Virginia. The transaction involved a tax-free exchange of stock and was accounted for as a purchase acquisition. Pioneer's shareholders received .6232 shares of Signet common stock for each Pioneer share held. This resulted in Signet issuing approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock. The transaction had an immaterial dilutive effect on Signet's earnings per share. 
<p>
In 1995, Signet began construction on a new operations center located close to Richmond, Virginia, which will be completed in 1996 at a total cost of approximately $55 million.
<p>
In the second quarter of 1995, Signet acquired the assets of Sheffield Management Company and Sheffield Investments, Inc., managers and distributors of the Blanchard family of mutual funds. These funds are marketed nationally through direct mail.
<p>
In the third quarter of 1995, Signet adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 122, 
"Accounting For Mortgage Servicing Rights." SFAS No. 122 requires that a mortgage banking enterprise recognize internally originated rights to service mortgage loans sold to others as separate assets. Upon adoption, Signet recognized pre-tax income of approximately $3.7 million. The impact of adoption on 1995 pre-tax income was $7.2 million.
<p>
On October 20, 1995, reflecting its confidence in the Company's growth plans and improving profitability, Signet's Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend by 3 cents to $0.20 per common share. Also in the fourth quarter of 1995, Signet recognized a $9.6 million gain on securitizing home equity loans.
<p>
On March 19, 1996, subsequent to the announcement of 1995 earnings, management discovered the Company was one of several major financial institutions that were victims of fraudulent commercial loan transactions which occurred prior to 1996. The Company had loan outstandings related to these transactions of approximately $81 million. Federal authorities informed the Company that they believe there will be substantial recoveries of assets related to these transactions. Based on information currently available, management recorded a $35 million commercial fraud loss in non-interest expense at December 31, 1995 ("the fraud loss") and recorded the estimated probable recovery amount of $46 million in other assets as a receivable. The receivable represents an amount management believes is likely to be recovered based on current facts and circumstances. The amount of the recovery is based on the Company's pro rata share of known claims to the total amount currently restrained and held by federal authorities less associated costs. The recovery amount is subject to change, even in the near term, as additional assets are recovered, additional claims are asserted or the market value of the restrained assets fluctuates. Management believes the $35 million charge to 1995 earnings is adequate to cover estimated losses related to these fraudulent transactions based on currently available information, but is unable to predict the timing of the recovery. The Company will vigorously pursue other sources of recovery, but currently is unable to determine the probability or amount of additional recoveries.
<p>
A detailed discussion of the 1995 operating results and financial condition at December 31, 1995 follows and is intended to help readers analyze the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. Certain consolidated financial information is located in Tables 27 through 33. In addition to the discussion of consolidated information, pro forma data is provided where it is meaningful to discuss the Company's results excluding Capital One. Consolidated and pro forma results are the same for time periods subsequent to February 28, 1995, the date of the spin-off.</font>
<p>

<A NAME="perfsum"><H2><EM>Summary of Performance</EM></H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>S</font><font size=+1>ignet reported consolidated net income for 1995 of $111.1 million, or $1.86 per share, compared with $149.8 million, or $2.59 per share, in 1994. Consolidated earnings for the year ended December 31, 1995 included the results of Capital One for the two months prior to the spin-off on February 28, 1995 and the $35.0 million fraud loss. The 1994 consolidated net income reflected a full year of Capital One's operations as well as special pre-tax charges of $92.2 million for restructuring and for terminating certain data processing contracts. Included in the restructuring charges were costs related to an early retirement plan, employee severance and facilities consolidation. On a pro forma basis, 1995 net income increased 71% from $55.8 million to $95.6 million. Pro forma earnings per share rose 65% from $0.97 in 1994 to $1.60. The pro forma 1995 performance reflected a substantial increase in net interest income, primarily resulting from strong growth in the Company's consumer and commercial loan portfolios. The return on assets ("ROA") and the return on common stockholders' equity ("ROE") for the year ended December 31, 1995 were 1.00% and 12.79%, respectively, compared with 1.31% and 14.33% for the same respective ratios in 1994. The pro forma profitability measures reflected the rise in earnings in 1995, resulting in an ROA of 0.90% and an ROE of 11.83%. These ratios compare favorably with the 0.63% ROA and 6.83% ROE achieved in 1994, on a pro forma basis.
<p>
Taxable equivalent net interest income totaled $503.8 million for 1995, a 4% decline from the $523.7 million recorded in 1994. Pro forma taxable equivalent net interest income of $478.7 million was a principal component of earnings and reflected a rise of $119.9 million from the 1994 level. The pro forma net yield margin for 1995 was 5.07%, a 48 basis point increase from the 4.59% for the prior year. This increase in the net yield margin was primarily due to an improvement in the net interest spread. The provision for loan losses of $38.7 million represented a significant rise from the 1994 level of $14.5 million as growth in the consumer loan portfolio warranted this action. Non-interest operating income totaled $277.5 million for 1995, a 51% decline from the $564.6 million for the prior year. The drop resulted from a sharp decline in credit card servicing and service charge income due to the spin-off. On a pro forma basis, non-interest operating income was lower in 1995 than in 1994, also due to a decline in credit card servicing and service charge income as the retained credit card portfolio was off-balance sheet for the majority of 1994. During 1995, Signet recognized net securities gains of $1.8 million, down from $3.5 million in 1994. Non-interest expense decreased $282.4 million from the previous year due in large part to the restructuring and data processing contract termination charges of $92.2 million and the spin-off. On a pro forma basis, non-interest expense also fell, primarily due to the restructuring charges in 1994, offset in part by the fraud loss in 1995. Declines in staff-related expenses were more than offset by increases in costs associated with expanded marketing and testing initiatives throughout the Company.

<H2>Net Interest Income</H2>
<p>
<font size=+5>T</font><font size=+1>axable equivalent net interest income, a primary contributor to earnings, was $503.8 million for 1995, a decline of $19.9 million, or 4%, from the $523.7 million for 1994 as shown in Table 28. The decline in net interest income reflected the impact of the spin-off. On a pro forma basis, taxable equivalent net interest income rose $119.9 million in 1995 to $478.7 million primarily due to an improved mix and a higher level of on-balance sheet average earning assets. The discussion of net interest income should be read in conjunction with Table 2--Net Interest Income Analysis and Table 8--Average Balance Sheet, both of which were prepared on a pro forma basis.
<p>
Average earning assets totaled $9.9 billion for 1995, down 2% from the previous year. On a pro forma basis, average earning assets amounted to $9.4 billion compared with $7.8 billion for 1994, a 21% increase. Loan securitizations reduced earning assets by transferring assets off the balance sheet. Adding average securitized loans to both years' pro forma average earning assets and adjusting for loans that may be sold to Capital One, in accordance with previously agreed upon terms of the spin-off, results in a 15% increase in managed earning assets year-over-year. The consumer, commercial, and real estate mortgage-residential loan categories experienced increases in average balances in 1995. Decreases occurred in the real estate-construction and real estate-commercial mortgage categories of the loan portfolio, reflecting the continued successful efforts of the Company to reduce its commercial real estate exposure. Investment securities rose $62.1 million on average over 1994 reflecting the purchase of U. S. Government and agency obligations in the fourth quarter of 1994. In December, 1995, as allowed by implementation guidance for SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," the Company reclassified all of its investment securities to securities available for sale. See a more detailed discussion of Earning Assets elsewhere in this Report.
<p>
Average interest bearing liabilities rose 28% to $8.1 billion for 1995, on a pro forma basis. Declines in savings certificates, money market savings, large denomination certificates, other short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings were more than offset by growth in savings accounts, money market and interest-checking, and foreign deposit categories and federal funds and repurchase agreements. Included in savings accounts were deposits held on behalf of Capital One. Approximately $500 million of these deposits are expected to transfer to Capital One in the first quarter of 1996. In 1995, average core deposits of $7.1 billion declined less than 2% from the prior year and represented 75% of average earning assets and 123% of average loans. The mix in core deposits changed as depositors responded to volatile interest rates by shortening maturities and transferring from savings certificates into money market and demand products. Pro forma non-interest bearing demand deposits declined less than 1%, on average, during 1995. See a more comprehensive discussion of Funding elsewhere in this Report.
<p>
The pro forma net interest spread of 4.44% for 1995 rose significantly from the 3.96% reported for the previous year. The increase resulted from funding rates rising less than the increase in yields on earning assets. The overall yield on earning assets for 1995 was 8.68%, up 147 basis points from 1994, while the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities amounted to 4.24%, up 99 basis points from the previous year.
<p>
The pro forma net yield margin rose by 48 basis points in 1995 to 5.07% from 4.59% for 1994. The increase in the net yield margin was the net result of several factors, as analyzed in Table 3. An approximate basis point impact was calculated for each item noted. Higher yields and growth in commercial and consumer loans more than offset the rise in funding rates to raise the net yield margin.
<p>
Signet uses various off-balance sheet interest rate derivatives as an integral part of its asset and liability management and trading activities. For Signet's core business, variable rate assets generally exceed variable rate liabilities. To manage the resulting interest rate risk, Signet enters into derivative transactions. On a consolidated basis, derivative contracts, used for interest rate risk management purposes, (decreased)/increased interest on earning assets by ($14.0) million, $13.4 million and $14.3 million and decreased borrowing costs by $20.3 million, $39.0 million and $82.4 million for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The overall increase in the net yield margin as a result of these instruments amounted to 5, 52 and 92 basis points for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. For a more detailed description and discussion of derivative income and expense impact on net income, refer to the Derivatives and Other Off-Balance Sheet Risk section elsewhere in this Report.
<p>
Loan securitizations also have an effect on net interest income and the net yield margin. For a detailed analysis of this effect, see the discussion of Consumer Loan Growth and Table 12 elsewhere in this Report.
<p>

<A NAME="provloanloss"><H2>Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses 
(on a pro forma basis)</H2></A>
<p>
The provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance to absorb anticipated future losses, net of recoveries, in the existing loan portfolio. In evaluating the adequacy of the provision and the allowance for loan losses, management takes into consideration several factors including national and local economic trends and conditions; weighted average historical losses; trends in delinquencies, bankruptcies and non-performing loans; trends in watch list growth/reduction; off-balance sheet credit risk; known deterioration and concentrations of credit; effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures; credit evaluations; and the experience and ability of lending management and staff. Commercial and real estate loan charge-offs are recorded when any loan or portions of loans are determined to be uncollectible. Credit card loans typically are charged off when they are six months past due and a minimum payment has not been received for 60 days, while other consumer loans are typically charged off when they are six months past due. Credit card and other consumer loans are also charged off when the customer declares bankruptcy. Once a loan has been charged off, Signet continues to pursue the collection of principal and interest. Table 4 provides a three-year comparison of activity in the pro forma allowance for loan losses along with details by loan category of the charge-offs and recoveries.
<p>
The provision for loan losses totaled $34.8 million for 1995 compared with provision reversals of $16.2 million in 1994. The increase resulted primarily from growth and increased losses in the consumer loan portfolio.
<p>
Net charge-offs doubled to $50.0 million for 1995, compared with $24.9 million for the prior year. In 1995, $13.9 million of the charge-offs resulted from the bulk sale of commercial real estate related loans for which there was sufficient allowance. Of the $30.1 million in real estate gross charge-offs in 1994, approximately $21.0 million were the result of the sale of $102 million of commercial real estate related loans. These sales were part of Signet's strategy to reduce its overall commercial real estate exposure. 
<p>
Commercial loan net charge-offs declined when comparing 1995 with 1994 due to improved credit quality and the generally favorable economic climate. Commercial net charge-offs for the Company totaled $1.2 million, a $2.6 million decrease from the previous year. The 1995 commercial loan charge-offs included $1.3 million related to the loan sale in the second quarter. One large commercial credit, for which there was sufficient allowance, was sold early in 1994 and accounted for approximately $3.3 million of the 1994 commercial loan charge-offs. Consumer loan net charge-offs rose in 1995 as Signet experienced higher charge-offs related to certain risk tests conducted for its "loan-by-check" product. These charge-offs were on loans generated from direct mail solicitations in late 1994 as Signet ran controlled tests to determine the criteria to be used when Signet expands loan-by-check solicitations. Information gathered from these risk tests was used to improve the credit quality of loans generated by subsequent solicitations. See footnote 2 to Table 4 for more detailed information on the loan-by-check charge-offs. Management expects the consumer loan charge-off ratio to decline to more moderate levels once the loans from these solicitations have seasoned.
<p>
The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 1995 was $129.7 million, or 2.39% of year-end loans, compared with the pro forma 1994 year-end allowance of $152.0 million, or 2.67% of loans. The 1995 year-end allowance for loan losses equated to 3.4 times year-end non-performing loans and 2.4 times year-end non-performing assets, down from December 31, 1994 when the pro forma allowance for loan losses amounted to 5.8 times non-performing loans and 3.1 times non-performing assets. The decline in the level of the allowance primarily reflected the higher consumer loan charge-offs and charge-offs taken on real estate related loans, the majority of which resulted from the second quarter 1995 real estate loan sale mentioned previously.
<p>
Signet's allocated allowance for loan losses for all loan categories is detailed in Table 5. Management allocates a specific amount to classified commercial and real estate loans which are individually reviewed. Classified loans represent those loans in which normal repayment of principal and interest is questionable. The credit worthiness of the borrower, the adequacy of the underlying collateral and the impact of business and economic conditions upon the borrower are all evaluated monthly. These factors lead to the risk ratings applied to these loans which assist in the related allowance allocation.
<p>
The consumer portfolio receives an overall allocation based on such factors as current and anticipated economic conditions, historical charge-off and recovery rates and trends in delinquencies. The remaining loan portfolios (unclassified commercial and real estate loans) are attributed allowance by applying historical loss information to the loan portfolios and taking into consideration other factors listed above. The overall allocation is not a prediction of future charge-off trends. Furthermore, the portion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount available for future losses that might occur since the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the entire loan portfolio. Management continuously refines this process and believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in the loan portfolio under current economic conditions.
<p>
Beginning in 1995, Signet adopted SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," and SFAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - Income Recognition and Disclosures." In accordance with SFAS No. 114, impaired loans are measured and reported based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or at the fair value of the loan's collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Impaired loans are specifically reviewed loans for which it is probable that the creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the loan agreement and represent a subset of the classified loans noted above. A valuation allowance is required to the extent that the measure of impaired loans is less than the recorded investment.
<p>
SFAS No. 114 does not apply to large groups of homogeneous loans such as consumer installment and credit card loans, which are collectively evaluated for impairment. Smaller balance commercial loans are also excluded from the application of SFAS No. 114. At December 31, 1995, Signet's loans that were considered to be impaired under SFAS No. 114 were comprised of $32.6 million of non-accrual loans for which the related allowance for loan losses was $10.6 million. The average recorded investment in impaired loans during the year ended December 31, 1995 was approximately $28.8 million. Collateral dependent loans, which were measured at the fair value of the loan's collateral made up the majority of impaired loans at December 31, 1995.
<p>
SFAS No. 118 allows a creditor to use existing methods for recognizing interest income on impaired loans. Interest receipts on impaired loans are applied in a manner consistent with Signet's policy for non-accrual loans. For the year ended December 31, 1995, no interest income was recorded on loans once placed on non-accrual status. All interest receipts on impaired loans were applied to the principal.</font>
<p>

<A NAME="nonintincome"><H2>Non-Interest Income (on a pro forma basis)</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>A</font><font size=+1> significant portion of Signet's revenue is derived from non-interest related sources including consumer loan servicing income, service charges, trust and investment management fees and other income. Signet's business strategies continued to emphasize non-interest operating income sources.
<p>
Table 6 details the various components of non-interest income for the past three years on a pro forma basis. Non-interest income for 1995 was $195.6 million, down 2% from $198.7 million for 1994 and included $0.5 million ($0.3 million after-tax) and $3.4 million ($2.2 million after-tax), for 1995 and 1994, respectively, of securities available for sale gains. Signet recognized nominal gains on investment securities during 1995 and 1994, as certain securities were called for redemption.
<p>
Pro forma non-interest operating income amounted to $193.8 million for 1995, a decline of $1.4 million, or less than 1%, versus 1994. Two primary reasons for this drop were: 1) prior to the Separation the entire credit card portfolio retained by Signet was securitized causing the pro forma consumer loan servicing and service charge income to be $13.7 million higher in 1994; and 2) intercompany reimbursements from Capital One for various fixed non-interest expenses prior to the Separation totaled $26.4 million.
<p>
Service charges on deposit accounts rose $2.1 million, or 3%, over 1994 to $68.2 million. Trust and investment management income, which totaled $23.5 million, was up 21% from last year primarily due to fees for managing the recently acquired Blanchard funds, growth in the number of customers served by Signet and revised trust fee schedules. Consumer loan servicing income and service charge income fell 51% from 1994 primarily related to the fact that prior to the Separation, the entire credit card portfolio retained by Signet was securitized. Signet recognized a $9.6 million gain on the securitization of home equity loans during the fourth quarter of 1995. Mortgage servicing and origination income totaled $22.4 million for 1995 compared with $18.7 million in 1994, an increase of 20%, as a result of the rise in mortgage loan servicing income more than compensating for a decline in the volume of mortgage loans originated. During 1995, residential mortgage production totaled $751 million, which was 13% lower than the 1994 level. However, towards the end of 1995, Signet experienced an increase in volume as mortgage rates declined. The Company's mortgage servicing portfolio grew to $6.6 billion at year-end 1995, up from $4.8 billion at December 31, 1994. Other service charges and fees, which consisted primarily of discount brokerage ($5.1 million), fees related to commercial and standby letters of credit ($3.9 million) and checkbooks ($3.4 million) totaled $15.1 million, level with 1994. Trading profits derived from services performed as a dealer bank for customers and from profits and losses earned on securities trading and arbitrage positions improved to $12.0 million for 1995 compared with trading losses of $268 thousand in 1994. Results from sales of mortgage loans also experienced a turnaround from losses of $3.3 million in 1994 to gains of $7.2 million in 1995. The adoption of SFAS No. 122 mentioned earlier and the sale of approximately $179 million adjustable rate mortgage loans in December 1995 were major factors in the improvement. Gains on sales of mortgage servicing rights amounted to $977 thousand in 1995, which was down from $6.0 million in 1994. The remaining portion of non-interest operating income, which included safe deposit box rentals, income from various insurance products, venture capital income and miscellaneous income from other sources, amounted to $21.7 million for 1995, an increase of $1.3 million, or 7%, over the prior year. </font>
<p>
<A NAME="nonintexp"><H2>Non-Interest Expense (on a pro forma basis)</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>P</font><font size=+1>ro forma non-interest expense for 1995 totaled $484.5 million, a decline of $3.8 million, or 1%, from 1994. Excluding the 1995 fraud loss and the 1994 restructuring charges, non-interest expenses were up $4.4 million, or just 1%, from the prior year as lower staff expenses were more than offset by higher expenses related to the growth of the consumer loan portfolio. Table 7 details the various categories of non-interest expense for the past three years on a pro forma basis.
<p>
Signet's pro forma efficiency ratio (the ratio of non-interest expense to taxable equivalent operating income) was 72.05% for 1995, compared with 88.15% for 1994. Excluding the fraud loss, the restructuring charges, other one-time spin-off related expenses and foreclosed property expense from non-interest expense changes the ratio to 66.88% and 80.30% for the two respective years.
<p>
On March 19, 1996, subsequent to the announcement of 1995 earnings, management discovered the Company was one of several major financial institutions that were victims of fraudulent commercial loan transactions which occurred prior to 1996. The Company had loan outstandings related to these transactions of approximately $81 million. Federal authorities informed the Company that they believe there will be substantial recoveries of assets related to these transactions. Based on information currently available, management recorded a $35 million commercial fraud loss in non-interest expense at December 31, 1995 and recorded the estimated probable recovery amount of $46 million in other assets as a receivable. The receivable represents an amount management believes is likely to be recovered based on current facts and circumstances. The amount of the recovery is based on the Company's pro rata share of known claims to the total amount currently restrained and held by federal authorities less associated costs. The recovery amount is subject to change, even in the near term, as additional assets are recovered, additional claims are asserted or the market value of the restrained assets fluctuates. Management believes the $35 million charge to 1995 earnings is adequate to cover estimated losses related to these fraudulent transactions based on currently available information, but is unable to predict the timing of the recovery. The Company will vigorously pursue other sources of recovery, but currently is unable to determine the probability or amount of additional recoveries.
<p>
In the third quarter of 1994, Signet's <a href="bod.htm">Board of Directors</a>approved a comprehensive core bank improvement plan to reduce the efficiency ratio through cost reductions and revenue initiatives. In conjunction with the plan, Signet recorded a restructuring charge of $43.2 million ($28.1 million after-tax, or $0.48 per share). The charge included approximately $15.6 million for increased retiree medical and pension benefits related to an early retirement program in which 225 employees participated; about $13.0 million of accelerated retiree medical and pension obligations and anticipated severance benefits for approximately 750 employees; and about $14.6 million related to the writedown of bank-owned properties and lease terminations due to the expected facilities abandonment related to the reduction in employees.
<p>
 As of December 31, 1995, the amounts actually paid and charged against the restructuring liability were approximately $7.0 million for severance payments to approximately 700 employees, $2.5 million for payments made under the early retirement program and approximately $7.0 for lease termination and other facilities related costs. All cash outflows related to the restructuring charge were funded by cash provided by operations. In addition, $19.5 million was transferred from the restructuring liability to Signet's pension benefit liability and postretirement liability and $0.4 million was reallocated within the restructuring liability from accrued facilities related costs to accrued benefits as a result of a change in the estimated costs. The remaining liability of $7.2 million is primarily comprised of accrued facilities related costs. As a result of implementing the cost reduction measures, the number of full-time equivalent employees excluding Capital One fell 7% from December 31, 1993. The plan, as it relates to the early retirement and severance programs, was fully implemented by the end of 1995. All other components of the plan should be completed by the end of 1996. Savings of approximately $40 million per year, primarily related to reduced salary and benefits expense, should be realized once the plan is fully implemented. As noted earlier, the decline in staff related costs in 1995 has been more than offset by an increase in expenses associated with expanded marketing and testing initiatives throughout the Company.
<p>
Staff expense (salaries and employee benefits), the largest component of non-interest expense, totaled $225.0 million, a 5% decline from 1994. Salaries dropped 3% and benefits expense fell 12% year-over-year primarily due to the decline in the number of employees mentioned above and favorable experience in benefits expense during 1995.
<p>
Certain of the non-interest expense categories reflected the costs associated with increased business volume. Travel and communications expense rose $1.8 million, or 8%, year-over-year, primarily due to higher postage and telephone charges related to managing a larger consumer loan portfolio. The $2.1 million increase in supplies and equipment expense was attributable to servicing the expanded consumer loan base.
<p>
 Public relations, sales and advertising expense rose $2.5 million, or 18%, to $15.9 million as Signet expanded its consumer loan solicitation program. This strategy was implemented to increase account growth and outstandings and has required significant out-of-pocket expenses to launch large scale but carefully planned national solicitations. The Company's solicitation strategy, which uses extensive testing, is designed to improve the efficiency of the solicitation process, thereby improving opportunities to create value by controlling credit exposure and creating higher probabilities for successful growth. The success of this strategy is witnessed by the growth in the total managed consumer loan portfolio from $1.6 billion at December 31, 1993 to $2.8 billion at December 31, 1995.
<p>
Occupancy expense decreased $3.4 million, or 8%, from year-to-year, due to the restructuring mentioned earlier. External data processing services totaled $27.1 million, a slight improvement from 1994. Professional services also experienced a moderate decline year-to-year. The $8.0 million, or 47%, drop in deposit insurance assessment from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") reflects the decline in the rates charged by the FDIC effective June 1, 1995. The two Signet banks are "well capitalized" under FDIC regulations and, as a result, pay the lowest FDIC insurance premium rate.
<p>
Other non-interest expense rose 64% from 1994 to 1995 primarily due to various servicing agreements with Capital One. These agreements cover servicing for Signet's credit card portfolio, solicitation expense paid by Capital One on Signet's behalf and payment of the difference between the secured card deposits' stated and agreed upon rates.</font>

<A NAME="inctax"><H2>Income Taxes (on a pro forma basis)</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>P</font><font size=+1>ro forma income tax expense for 1995 was $48.8 million as compared with $15.8 million for 1994. This represented an effective tax rate of 33.8% for 1995 and 22.0% for 1994. The significant increase in the effective tax rate was attributable to a decline in the ratio of tax exempt income as a percentage of pre-tax income. Pre-tax income grew dramatically and total tax exempt income dropped from year-to-year as a majority of the municipal bonds have been called. <a href="notel.htm">Note L</a> to the Consolidated Financial Statements reconciles reported income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the federal statutory rate to income before income taxes.</font>

<H2>Earning Assets</H2>
<p>
<font size=+5>P</font><font size=+1>ro forma average earning assets totaled $9.4 billion for 1995, (as shown in Table 8--Average Balance Sheet), an increase of 21% from the 1994 level. The portfolios experiencing the largest declines were federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell ($333 million) and interest bearing deposits with other banks ($218 million), while the securities available for sale and the loan portfolios increased by $378 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. A more detailed discussion of the various earning asset categories follows.</font>
<p>
<A NAME="loans"><H2>Loans</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>P</font><font size=+1>ro forma loans (net of unearned income) for 1995, averaged $5.8 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 27%, from the 1994 level. Average balances increased in the consumer, commercial and real estate-residential mortgage loan categories, while the real estate-construction and real estate-commercial mortgage loan average balances declined. The composition of the loan portfolio has been significantly altered over the past three years by strong growth in commercial and consumer loans reflecting positive response to Signet's innovative product offerings. In addition, Signet reduced its overall average commercial real estate loan exposure by $133 million during 1995. At year-end, Signet had no commercial loans outstanding to borrowers in the same or related industries which, in total, exceeded ten percent of total loans. Approximately half of the loan portfolio is secured, including all real estate related loans, leases, and a portion of the consumer and commercial loan portfolios. The unsecured portion includes mostly student, loan-by-check and credit card loans. Signet reviews each prospective credit in order to determine an adequate level of security or collateral prior to making the loan. The type of collateral will vary and range from liquid assets to real estate.
<p>
Consumer loans averaged $2.2 billion for 1995, a 48% increase from 1994, and represented 38% of the total loan portfolio. This category consists of student, home equity, installment, credit card and other consumer loan types. The increase in consumer loans was concentrated in student loans and installment loans generated by Signet's information-based strategy. The growth was achieved through a variety of attractive products offered to carefully targeted customer segments. Table 13 illustrates the effectiveness of Signet's ability to implement growth strategies in the consumer and student loan markets in 1995. Risks faced by the Company include the possibility of (i) future economic downturns causing an increase in credit losses and (ii) an increasing number of consumers defaulting on payments or seeking protection under bankruptcy laws, resulting in accounts being charged off as uncollectible.
<p>
Commercial loans, which represented 46% of the total average loan portfolio, averaged $2.6 billion for 1995, an increase of 23% from last year. Signet's commercial loan portfolio is strongly oriented toward a diverse group of middle market borrowers. These loans are predominately in the manufacturing, wholesaling, services and real estate industries. Signet also markets to certain specialized industries, such as media and health care. The specialized industries are targeted based on certain in-house expertise along with projected prospects for profitability. The credit risk associated with middle market and specialized industry borrowers is principally influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on the borrower's operations. In addition, the Company faces the risk of diminishing collateral values. Collateralization for commercial loans primarily consists of liquid assets, trading assets and capital assets, and is determined on a case-by-case basis.
<p>
Real estate-construction loans averaged $225 million, a decrease of 10%, or $25 million, from the 1994 average. This category represented less than 4% of the average loan portfolio for 1995. During 1995 and 1994, the Company sold portfolios of real estate related loans totaling $55 million and $102 million, respectively, at a discount for which there was sufficient allowance. The sale of these loans accounted for approximately $13.9 million and $21.0 million of the 1995 and 1994, respectively, net charge-offs. The real estate loan sale impacted the real estate-construction loan ($6 million-1995 and $73 million-1994) and real estate-commercial mortgage loan ($49 million-1995 and $29 million-1994) categories. The credit risk associated with real estate lending is principally influenced by real property markets and the resulting impact on the borrower's operations. A primary risk associated with the real estate business involves the possibility of future economic downturns in the real property market causing an increase in credit losses. Signet maintains loan-to-value maximums of 80% for construction and commercial mortgage loans. The maximum loan-to-value collateral limits have been established to meet the Company's goals in targeting percentages based on diversification strategy, market conditions and economic conditions.
<p>
Real estate-commercial mortgage loans represented less than 8% of the average loan portfolio in 1995. This category averaged $452 million, a 19% decrease from 1994. The portfolio consisted of $254 million of commercial mortgage loans and $198 million of mini-permanent (interim) mortgage loans compared with $276 million and $285 million for the respective loan types in 1994. Construction loans typically are converted to mini-permanent mortgage loans when the related project is generating sufficient cash to cover debt service, and permanent financing, for various reasons, is not desired or obtainable at the present time. Real estate-commercial mortgage loans decreased partially as a result of the sale of approximately $49 million in 1995 and $29 million in 1994 of these loans for which there was sufficient allowance.
<p>
Real estate-residential mortgage loans increased $143 million, or 146%, from 1994 to average $241 million as a the result of growth in mortgages originated by Signet and loans acquired in the Pioneer acquisition. This category consisted of conventional home mortgages which experienced a decline in refinancings during 1994. Refinancing activity rose substantially toward the end of 1995 as interest rates fell. In December, 1995, Signet sold approximately $179 million of adjustable rate mortgage loans at a $3.1 million gain as management anticipated a rise in prepayments on this portfolio as rates declined. It is the Company's policy to maintain average loan-to-value maximums of 85% for real estate-residential mortgages. Loans above 80% have mortgage insurance.
<p>
The various on-balance sheet loan categories for the past three year-ends are detailed in Table 9. Table 10 shows the maturities of selected loan categories at year-end 1995. Loans, as a result of maturities, monthly payments, sales and securitizations provide an important source of liquidity. See discussion on Liquidity elsewhere in this Report. Unused loan commitments related primarily to commercial loans and excluding credit card loans were approximately $2.7 billion at year-end 1995 down from $2.9 billion at year-end 1994.</font>
<p>
<H2><A NAME="securities">Securities</A></H2>
<p>
<font size=+5>T</font><font size=+1>he securities portfolio consists of trading account securities, securities available for sale and investment securities. If the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold securities until maturity, they are classified as investment securities and carried at amortized historical cost. Otherwise, securities are classified either as available for sale, which are carried at market with unrealized gains and losses recorded through adjustments to stockholders' equity, or as trading account securities and carried at market with unrealized gains and losses recorded through earnings, depending on management's asset/liability strategy, liquidity needs or objectives. The accounting policy for investment securities is described in Note A to Consolidated Financial Statements. As noted earlier, Signet implemented SFAS No. 115 in 1994. In December, 1995, Signet reclassified the entire investment securities portfolio to the available for sale category. Investment securities for 1995 averaged $324 million, a $61 million increase over the 1994 level.
<p>
At December 31, 1995, trading account securities consisted of $403 million of government securities, $73 million of asset-backed securities and $3 million of other securities. Trading account securities averaged $476 million in 1995, up 66% from the $287 million level in 1994.
<p>
Securities available for sale are used as part of management's asset/liability strategy and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, resultant prepayment risk and other factors dictated by the strategy. These securities consist principally of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. All mortgage-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk since the mortgages related to these securities can prepay at any time without penalty. This risk occurs when interest rates decline, causing the securities to lose value since the term and, therefore, the interest stream of the securities has shortened due to prepayments. The fixed rate mortgage-backed and treasury securities are subject to interest rate risk. Therefore, when interest rates fall, these fixed rate securities gain value. At December 31, 1995, the net unrealized gains, net of tax, related to securities available for sale, totaled $45.2 million primarily from an increase in the value of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury obligations due to declining interest rates.
<p>
Pro forma securities available for sale for 1995 averaged $1.7 billion, an increase of $378 million over the 1994 level. 
Approximately $233 million of securities were reclassified from investment securities to securities available for sale in December, 1995, as noted above. The U.S. Treasury securities portfolio totaled $574 million at year-end 1995, up from $408 million at the end of 1994. At December 31, 1995, the securities available for sale portfolio (excluding securities having no maturity) had a remaining average maturity of approximately four years and unrealized gains of $78.8 million and unrealized losses of $12.3 million. Table 11 shows the maturities of the securities available for sale portfolio and the weighted average yields to maturity of such securities.
<p>
At December 31, 1995, all CMOs and mortgage-backed pass-through securities held by Signet were issued or backed by federal agencies. At the end of the past two years, Signet did not have any investments with a single issuer (except for U.S. Government and agency obligations which are separately disclosed in this Report) which aggregated greater than ten percent of stockholders' equity.</font>
<p>
<A NAME="earnasset"><H2>Other Earning Assets</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>O<.font><font size=+1>ther earning assets are comprised of interest bearing deposits with other banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, loans held for securitization and loans held for sale. Included in the loans held for sale category are loans held by Signet on behalf of Capital One under previously agreed upon terms of the spin-off. 
<p>
Pro forma other earning assets averaged $1.2 billion in 1995, down $195 million, or 14%, from $1.4 billion in 1994. These earning assets reflect the normal process of balancing the subsidiary banks' reserve position; dealer activities, in which money market instruments are bought and then sold to customers; and, for a short period of time, holding loans and/or securities to be sold in the secondary market. These investments are generally short-term, high quality and very liquid (see Liquidity discussion) and consequently, have yields generally lower than loans or investment securities. The level of these investments can vary from year-to-year as they are used to manage interest rate risk, to take advantage of short-term interest rate opportunities and provide liquidity.</font>
<p>
<A NAME="consloan"><H2>Consumer Loan Growth</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>I</font><font size=+1>n 1994, Signet expanded its use of information-based strategies to all types of consumer loans, which significantly increased growth in this portfolio. This technique involved generating a data base of potentially creditworthy customers for particular products and then following up with direct mail solicitations. Much of the growth was in a new loan product, "loan-by-check," whereby customers received a direct-mail solicitation and were offered installment loans in the form of a check. To activate the loan, the customer endorsed and deposited the check. Signet is also applying information-based strategies to home equity, student and small business loans. Solicitations in these areas are mostly in the preliminary testing stages. These tests are designed to help Signet develop products that are both appealing to customers and economically feasible for the Company. As a result of these solicitations, loans grew at a strong pace. From December 31, 1994 to December 31, 1995, the student loan portfolio (including $300 million in student loans held for securitization) increased $161 million; the installment loan portfolio (excluding loans that may be sold to Capital One) grew $290 million; and the home equity loan portfolio (including $481 million of securitized loans) was up $56 million. 
<p>
In order to facilitate the growth in the consumer loan portfolio, the Company has securitized portions of the portfolio. Securitization is an off-balance sheet funding technique which transforms a pool of loans into marketable securities. The loans are generally transferred to a trust and interests in the trust are sold to public or private investors for cash. In a securitization, the gain on the sale of the loans is limited to the loans existing at the date of sale and should not include amounts related to future loans to be sold according to the terms of the securitization agreements. For loans with a relatively short life (such as credit card receivables), no gain is recorded at the time of sale. Rather, the net of interest income, fee income, charge-offs and the investors' coupon payments becomes servicing income for Signet and is recorded monthly as earned. Therefore, amounts that would previously have been reported as interest income, loan service charges and provision for loan losses are instead reported in non-interest income as consumer loan servicing income. The change in the method of income recognition has a minimal impact on the Company's earnings.
<p>
 Because loan losses are absorbed against these cash flows, the Company's consumer loan servicing income over the term of the transaction may vary depending upon the credit performance of the securitized loans. However, the Company's exposure is generally contractually limited to these cash flows. For loans with a longer average life (such as equity lines of credit), a gain is recorded at the time of sale equal to the present value of the anticipated future net cash flows. Table 12 indicates the impact of securitizations on income, average assets, return on assets and net yield margin for the past three years. 
<p>
The managed consumer loan portfolio is comprised of consumer loans, consumer loans held for sale, consumer loans held for securitization and securitized consumer loans, less loans that may be sold to Capital One in accordance with previously agreed upon terms of the spin-off. Securitized consumer loans are not assets of the Company and, therefore, are not shown on the balance sheet. Signet's managed consumer loan portfolio increased by $511 million, or 22%, from December 31, 1994 to December 31, 1995 as indicated in Table 13.</font>
<p>
<A NAME="risk"><H2><EM>Risk Elements (on a pro forma basis)</EM></H2></A>
<p>
<H2>Non-Performing Assets</H2>
<p>
<font size=+5>N</font><font size=+1>on-performing assets include non-accrual loans, restructured loans and foreclosed properties. Non-accrual loans 
are loans on which interest accruals have been suspended. Signet discontinues interest accruals on commercial and real estate loans when they become contractually past due 90 days as to principal or interest payments or when other internal or external factors indicate that collection of principal or interest is doubtful. Occasionally, exceptions are made to this policy if supporting collateral is adequate and the loan is in the process of collection. Credit card loans typically are charged off when they are six months past due and a minimum payment has not been received for 60 days, while other consumer loans typically are charged off when the loan is six months past due; therefore, these loans are not usually placed in non-accruing status. Restructured loans are loans on which a concession (such as a reduction in interest rate below the current market rate for new debt with similar risks) is granted to a borrower. Foreclosed properties are generated when Signet physically takes possession of the collateral.
<p>
Non-performing assets at year-end 1995 totaled $54.3 million, or 1.00% of loans and foreclosed properties. This compares with $48.5 million, or 0.85%, respectively, at the end of 1994. Overall non-performing real estate assets increased $8.4 million although foreclosed properties dropped $6.7 million. Table 14 provides details on the various components of non-performing assets for the last three year-ends.
<p>
Foreclosed properties totaled $15.8 million at the end of 1995, and were equal to 29% of total non-performing assets and 36% of non-performing real estate assets. Signet sold $9.2 million of foreclosed properties during 1995. The reserve for foreclosed properties was eliminated at December 31, 1994 since management deemed foreclosed properties to be fairly valued on the balance sheet.
Accruing loans past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments totaled $66.4 million and $40.6 million at the end of 1995 and 1994, respectively. The details of these past due loans are displayed in Table 15. The past due commercial and real estate loans were in the process of collection and were adequately collateralized. Also, of the 1995 past due student loans, $30.7 million, or 95%, were indirectly government guaranteed and do not represent material loss exposure to Signet.
<p>
At year-end 1995, management was monitoring $17.1 million of loans for which the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms was uncertain. These loans were not included in the Table 15 disclosure. They are followed closely, and management at present believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses that may be attributable to these loans.
<p>
Interest recorded as income on year-end non-accrual and restructured loans was $0.9 million, $0.5 million and $2.5 million for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, compared with interest income of $4.1 million, $3.4 million and $7.5 million for the same respective periods which would have been recorded had these loans performed in accordance with their original terms. The pre-tax costs of carrying (funding) an average of $15.0 million of foreclosed properties in 1995, $34.1 million in 1994 and $61.6 million in 1993 were approximately $0.6 million, $1.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively, when calculated by applying an average annual cost of funds to the outstanding balance. These amounts have been calculated using historical rates, and may not necessarily reflect improved earnings on a prospective basis, as these funds may be reemployed at different rates.</font>
<p>
<H2><EM>Funding (on a pro forma basis)</EM></H2>
<p>
<A NAME="deposits"><H2>Deposits</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>S</font><font size=+1>ignet offers a diverse range of products including interest bearing and non-interest bearing demand, savings and 
certificates of deposits, both domestic and foreign. The Company competes for deposits with other commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, the bond and stock market and other providers of non-bank financial services, including money market funds, credit unions, mutual funds and other deposit gathering institutions. Average deposits totaled $7.3 billion for 1995, down 2% from 1994. Core deposits averaged $7.1 billion for 1995, virtually unchanged from 1994. These deposits represent Signets largest and most important funding source due to their relatively low cost and reasonably stable nature. This source of funding also enhances the Company's overall liquidity position. The core deposit categories which experienced the greatest decline were money market savings and savings certificates which fell $257 million and $129 million, respectively, from 1994. The increase in savings accounts was due to growth in the Capital One deposits held by Signet under previously agreed upon terms of the spin-off. Approximately $500 million of these deposits will transfer to Capital One in the first quarter of 1996. The competition among financial institutions for these deposits and increased consumer awareness have effectively increased the relative cost of and reduced the overall benefits received from these deposits.
<p>
Purchased deposits (large denomination certificates and foreign deposits) averaged $211 million for 1995, a decline of $34 million, or 14%, from the prior year. Large denomination certificates are principally sold to existing corporate customers. The demand for such funds depends upon the Company's varying financing needs. As a result, the interest rates are based on market competition for these funds. Table 16 shows the maturity composition of large denomination certificates at year-end 1995.</font>
<p>
<A NAME="borrowings"><H2>Short-Term and Long-Term Borrowings</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>S</font><font size=+1>hort-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper, Treasury tax and loan deposits, Federal Reserve borrowings and short-term borrowings from other banks. This category of borrowings is an accessible source of generally moderately priced funds and has become an important financing vehicle for Signet's balance sheet management. Signet supplements its funding sources in the short-term money market and through securitizations. Short-term borrowings have an original maturity of less than one year. This category rose $1.9 billion from 1994 to average $2.1 billion in order to fund the growth in loans. See <a href="noteg.htm">Note G </a>to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on this source of funds.
<p>
Long-term borrowings represent a very stable, although relatively expensive, source of funds and have been used to provide Tier II capital to Signet's subsidiaries, for acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. This category averaged $253 million for 1995, a decline of only $1.6 million from 1994. <a href="noteh.htm">Note H</a> to Consolidated Financial Statements provides a detailed analysis of long-term borrowings at December 31, 1995 and 1994.</font>
<p>
<A NAME="stkequity"><H2>Stockholders' Equity</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>S</font><font size=+1>tockholders' equity provides a source of permanent funding, allows for future growth and assists the Company in withstanding unforeseen adverse developments. At December 31, 1995, stockholders' equity totaled $864 million, an increase of $120 million, or 16%, from the previous year-end pro forma level of $744 million. The increase reflects net retained income for 1995 of $49 million, net unrealized gains on securities available for sale of $67 million and the issuance of common stock through investor, employee stock purchase and stock option plans, which, in total, added an additional $13 million in net proceeds to equity.
<p>
At the time of the spin-off, Signet's stockholders' equity was reduced by $383 million, the amount of Capital One's stockholders' equity less minority interest (see <a href="notet.htm">Note T </a> to the Consolidated Financial Statements). This generally reduced Signet's capital ratios; however, the ratios remained strong and both of Signet's banks are within "well-capitalized" regulatory guidelines (see <a href=#capital> Capital Analysis</a>). Effective January 1, 1994, Signet adopted SFAS No. 115, which requires that securities classified as available for sale be reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of retained earnings, net of tax. 
<p>
At December 31, 1995, the net unrealized gains, net of tax, related to securities available for sale, totaled $45.2 million, primarily from a rise in the value of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury obligations. Signet has no plans at present to sell these securities.
<p>
The dividends declared during 1995 of $46.5 million represented an annual rate of $0.79 per share. On October 20, 1995, reflecting its confidence in the Company's growth plans and improving profitability, Signet's Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend by 3 cents to $0.20 per common share. The principal sources of dividends to be paid to shareholders are dividends and interest from the subsidiary banks. Various state and federal laws and policies limit the ability to pay dividends to shareholders and the ability of Signet's subsidiary banks to pay dividends to the Company. Under applicable regulatory restrictions, each of the Company's banking subsidiaries was able to pay dividends 
to the Company in 1995.</font>
<p>
<A NAME="capital"><H2>Capital Analysis</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>A </font><font size=+1>primary management objective is to sustain its strong capital position to merit the confidence of customers, the investing public, banking regulators and stockholders. A strong capital position has helped the Company withstand unforeseen adverse developments and take advantage of profitable investment opportunities. Table 17 details certain risk-based and other capital data.
<p>
Capital adequacy is defined as the amount of capital needed to maintain future asset growth and to absorb losses. Regulators consider a range of factors when determining capital adequacy, such as the organization's size, quality and stability of earnings, risk diversification, management expertise, asset quality, liquidity and internal controls. Management reviews the various capital measures monthly and takes appropriate action to ensure they are within established internal and external guidelines. Management believes Signet's current capital and liquidity positions are strong and its capital position is adequate to support its business areas.
<p>
The Federal Reserve Board has issued capital guidelines which are sensitive to credit risk factors (including off-balance sheet exposure). Emphasis is placed on common stockholders' equity in relationship to total assets adjusted for risk. The focus is principally on credit risk, but does include certain interest rate and market risks when assigning risk categories. The risk-based capital guidelines define capital as either core capital (Tier I) or supplementary capital (Tier II). These guidelines require banking organizations to meet a minimum total capital ratio of 8%, with at least 4% Tier I Capital. 
<p>

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") requires federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA established five capital tiers: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. A depository institution's capital tier depends upon the relationship of its capital levels to various relevant capital measures, which include a risk-based capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure, and certain other factors. As of December 31, 1995, both of Signet's banking subsidiaries met the well-capitalized criteria.
<p>
As detailed in Table 17, the Company's consolidated risk-based capital ratios at December 31, 1995 were 12.56% and 9.82% for Total Capital and Tier I Capital, respectively. The Federal Reserve Board also requires a minimum leverage ratio of 3%. For most corporations, including Signet, the minimum leverage ratio is 3% plus an additional cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points depending upon risk profiles and other factors. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier I Capital by the current quarter's total average assets less goodwill and other disallowed intangibles. Signet's leverage ratio at December 31, 1995 was 6.93%. The decline in these capital ratios from December 31, 1994 reflects the impact of the spin-off. However, on a pro forma basis, the Company's total stockholders' equity to assets ratio improved from 7.54% at December 31, 1994 to 7.87% at year-end 1995. For informational purposes, Table 18 details the components of Signet's intangible assets for the past three years and the estimated amortization for the next five years. The increase in goodwill during 1995 was due to the acquisition of Sheffield Management Company and Sheffield Investments, Inc.</font>
<p>

<A NAME="derivatives"><H2>Derivatives and Other Off-Balance Sheet Risk</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>S</font><font size=+1>ignet has used financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers, to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to participate in trading activities. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby and commercial letters of credit, mortgages sold with recourse and interest rate contracts, including forwards, futures, options and interest rate swaps, caps and floors. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit or interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. Signet uses the same credit policies for off-balance sheet items as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.
<p>
Interest rate swaps, where the Company generally makes variable rate payments and receives fixed rate payments, were entered into to manage the interest rate risk in the existing balance sheet mix. During 1995, the Company's interest rate swaps decreased income on earning assets by $14.0 million and reduced borrowing costs by $20.3 million for a net pre-tax impact of $6.3 million. Of the existing interest rate swaps, the majority will mature by 1998. Interest rate floors, with average strike prices of approximately 5% tied to the three-month LIBOR decreased income on earning assets by $1.9 million in 1995. Interest rate floors were purchased to hedge variable rate assets against decreases in interest rates. Maturity dates on the interest rate floors range from 1997-2003. Interest rate caps, with average strike prices of approximately 7.5% tied to the three-month LIBOR, increased borrowing costs by $0.5 million in 1995. Interest rate caps were purchased to hedge variable rate liabilities against increases in interest rates. All interest rate caps mature by the end of 1996.
<p> 
Futures contracts were purchased to hedge interest rate changes on securities available for sale and savings certificates. During 1995, gains and losses on closed contracts had an immaterial impact on income on securities available for sale and expense on savings certificates. As the derivative contracts mature, management will determine the necessity to enter into additional contracts at that time. Refer to Table 19 for a roll forward schedule of interest rate swap activity. The impact of derivative activity on liquidity is discussed in the Liquidity discussion. Refer to <a href="noteo.htm">Note O</a> and Note U to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of off-balance sheet risk. Discussion of the impact of derivative income on operations is included in <a href="notea.htm">Note A</a> to Consolidated Financial Statements and the Interest Rate Sensitivity discussion.</font>
<p>
<A NAME="intrate"><H2>Interest Rate Sensitivity</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>S</font><font size=+1>ignet's interest rate sensitivity position is managed by the Asset and Liability Committee ("ALCO") and monitored through the use of simulations on rate sensitive pre-tax income. Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and changes in rate sensitive income due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. For example, in periods of rising rates, the core banking businesses will experience wider spreads as consumer deposit costs lag increases in market interest rates. Improved spreads due to the lag in pricing on consumer deposits will be partially offset to the extent that the funding cost on the investment portfolio increases. ALCO routinely uses derivatives such as interest rate swaps to insulate the Company against the possibility of sudden changes in interest rates. 
<p>
ALCO, in managing interest rate sensitivity, also uses simulations to better measure the impact that market changes and alternative strategies might have on net interest income. Current period maturity, repricing information and projected balance sheet strategies are used to simulate rate sensitivity. The lag effect of consumer deposit rates, determined through historical analysis and forecasting techniques, is also modeled. These simulations show that an immediate and sustained 100 basis point change in interest rates would have less than a 2% impact on rate sensitive income over the next twelve months, reflecting Signet's conservative balance sheet strategy. ALCO operates under a policy designed to limit the impact of a sudden 100 basis point change in interest rates to no more than a 5% change in rate sensitive income over a twelve month period.
<p>
During the latter half of 1995, as well as at year-end, Signet positioned itself for a declining rate environment. While Table 20 shows a basic 180-day net asset position of $485 million at December 31, 1995, the Company has taken steps to limit its exposure to declining interest rates through the use of derivative products. Execution of these off-balance sheet interest rate and hedging instruments resulted in a 180-day net liability position of $2.1 billion, or 19% of total assets.
<p>
At December 31, 1995, the notional values of derivative products for the purpose of managing interest rate risk were $2.8 billion of interest rate swaps, $650 million of interest rate floors and $300 million of interest rate caps.</font>
<p>
<A NAME="liquidity"><H2>Liquidity (on a pro forma basis</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>L</font><font size=+1>iquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through liability management. Both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective liability management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. Stable core deposits and other interest bearing funds, accessibility to local, regional and national funding sources and readily marketable assets are all important determinants of liquidity. Table 21 reflects certain liquidity ratios for the past three year-ends, on a pro forma basis.
<p>
Asset liquidity is generally provided by interest bearing deposits with other banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities available for sale, loans held for sale and trading account securities. Liability liquidity is measured by the Company's ability to obtain deposits and purchased funds at favorable rates and in adequate amounts and by the length of maturities. Since core deposits are the most stable source of liquidity a bank can have because they are government insured, the high level of average core deposits during 1995 maintained the Company's strong liquidity position. Signet's 1995 pro forma average loan balances were entirely funded with core deposits. 
<p>
However, as noted previously, approximately $500 million of core deposits will transfer to Capital One in the first quarter 
of 1996. Signet's equity base, as noted earlier, also provides a stable source of funding. The parent company has not 
recently relied on the capital markets for funding. The parent company does not have any significant long-term debt issues maturing until 1997; however, on February 1, 1994, Signet called for redemption at par the remaining $11.9 million of 7 3/4% Senior Debentures due in 1997.
<p>
For 1995, cash and cash equivalents declined $961 million primarily due to a sharp decline in interest bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. Cash used by operations was $70 million for this time period resulting mainly from purchases and originations exceeding proceeds from sales of loans held for sale and purchases exceeding proceeds from sales of trading account securities. Cash used by investing activities amounted to $2.3 billion principally due to purchases of securities available for sale and an increase in loans. Cash provided by financing activities amounted to $1.4 billion due primarily to financing Capital One prior to the spin-off.
<p>
The Company's future liquidity may be affected by derivative activities. Potential losses are limited to counterparty risk in situations where Signet is owed money; that is, when Signet holds contracts with positive fair values. The Company's net unrealized gain as of December 31, 1995 was $58.0 million. The Company does not expect any losses from counterparties failing to meet their obligations. Also, at December 31, 1995, the Company had unrealized losses on derivative transactions totaling $21.8 million, which if terminated would require a cash outlay. Signet presently has no intention to terminate these contracts. There are no credit concerns related to the Company's obligations and it expects to meet those obligations without default.
<p>
<A NAME="inflation"><H2>Inflation</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+5>S</font><font size=+1>ince interest rates and inflation rates do not always move in concert, the effect of inflation on banks may not necessarily be the same as on other businesses. A bank's asset and liability structure differs significantly from that of manufacturing and other concerns in that virtually all assets and liabilities are of a monetary nature. Inflation affects a banks lending activities. Since inflation tends to drive the costs of goods and services higher, the level of customers' financing needs usually rises to keep pace. As loan demand increases, competition for variable funds may raise the base rate charged for these funds. Banks then are faced with increased credit risk as borrowers experience greater exposure to financial risk from the higher rates. In such cases, banks place more emphasis on the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. As a result, continued inflation increases the overall cost of doing business, both directly and indirectly.</font>
<p>
<A NAME="fairvalue"><H2>Fair Value</H2></A>
<p>
<font size=+6>T</font><font size=+1>he requirements of SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments," are included in Note R to Consolidated Financial Statements. Since interest rates, credit risks and other dimensions of fair value of the Company's assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments change rapidly and, since this disclosure excludes some aspects of the Company's overall fair value, Note R should not be viewed as an indication of the Company's overall market value. Furthermore, certain valuation techniques used in developing Note R require assumptions and forecasts of cash flows. While Note R complies with SFAS No. 107, these assumptions and other subjective determinations should be considered when interpreting the data.</font>
<p>
<A NAME="acctng"><H2>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</H2></A>
<p>
SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of," was 
issued in March 1995. The statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Signet will adopt the statement beginning January 1, 1996. The effect of adopting SFAS No. 121 is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company.

<BODY><H1>Signet Completes Management Transition</H1>
<p>
<font size=+1>
RICHMOND, Va --(Jan. 2, 1997)--Signet Banking Corporation's Board of Directors elected 
Malcolm S. McDonald chairman and chief executive officer and T. Gaylon Layfield III president 
and chief operating officer effective at year-end 1996. Earlier last year, Wallace B. Millner was 
named vice chairman in addition to his role as chief financial officer. These promotions complete 
the management transition resulting from former Chairman Robert M. Freeman's retirement.
<p>
"Bob announced his decision to retire in early 1995 so that we would have ample time to adjust
 to our new roles,"  said Malcolm McDonald.  "Our management team has worked together for 
many years which enabled the transition to occur very smoothly.  We are delighted that we have 
the added benefit of continuing to work with Bob as an ongoing member of our Board."  
McDonald, Layfield and Millner have 25, 21 and 24 years with Signet respectively and each 
has functioned in numerous capacities within the bank, the industry and the communities 
Signet serves.

<p>
<font size=+1>
RICHMOND, Va. - (Oct. 17, 1996) - Signet Banking Corporation today reported earnings of $29.6 million, or $.49 per share, for the third quarter of 1996.  Earnings were down modestly from both the previous quarter and the 1995 third quarter as a result of increased loan loss provisions for consumer loan growth, and a one-time charge for the recapitalization of the Savings Association Insurance Fund.  The company reported earnings of $30.5 million, or $.50 per share, and $30.1 million, or $.50 per share, respectively, for the second quarter of 1996 and the third quarter of 1995.
<p>

	Discussing the results, President and Chief Executive Officer Malcolm S. McDonald said that he was especially pleased with the nature of the loan growth during the quarter.  "Asset quality remains very strong and our disciplined marketing is rewarding us with healthy growth in both the consumer and commercial arenas.  Our confidence in an information-based strategy continues to grow.  Additionally, we are now embarking on a project to create an entirely new infrastructure to support our strategy more efficiently."
<p>

	Managed loans (balance sheet and securitized assets) grew 3 percent from the previous quarter to $7.2 billion.  Direct marketing of installment and home equity loans, coupled with seasonal growth in educational lending, fueled a 6 percent increase in the managed consumer portfolio during the quarter.  Specialized lending and Signets leasing business contributed to 4 percent growth in the commercial loan portfolio.  In keeping with Signets de-emphasis of commercial real estate lending, the company sold $43 million of performing loans in July.  Commercial real estate loans declined 11 percent  to $526 million.
<p>

	Non-performing assets at September 30, 1996 totaled $43.9 million or .71 percent of loans and foreclosed properties, down 15 percent from $51.5 million a year earlier, and down 20 percent from $54.9 million at June 30, 1996.  Net charge-offs for the quarter were $17.0 million, or 1.15 percent of average loans.  Charge-offs included $3.7 million related to one commercial construction loan.  At quarter end, the allowance for loan losses totaled $128.5 million and was equal to 441 percent of non-performing loans and 2.08 percent of loans outstanding.
<p>

	Total revenues (net interest income and non-interest income) for the quarter were $186.6 million, up 3 percent from $181.2 million in the second quarter.  Despite higher interest expense, net interest income increased modestly during the third quarter. Signets net interest margin was 4.70 percent, down 5 basis points from the previous quarter.  The net interest margin is projected to improve somewhat as consumer loans become a greater proportion of the earning asset mix.  Non-interest income benefited from strong trading profits and revenues earned by Signets specialty commercial groups.
<p>

	Non-interest expense for the third quarter was $122.9 million compared with $121.5 million in the second quarter of 1996.  Public relations, sales and advertising expense rose $1.7 million in the third quarter as higher solicitation expense generated loan growth.  Non-interest expense also included a one-time charge of $1.6 million for the Savings Association Insurance Fund recapitalization and a charge of $.6 million taken in conjunction with the sale of commercial real estate loans.  The efficiency ratio was 65 percent.
<p>

	The third quarter return on equity was 13.6 percent and the return on average assets was 1.03 percent. The equity-to-assets ratio increased to 7.74 percent.

<BODY><H1>Signet Initiates Redesign Project</H1>
<p>
<font size=+1>
RICHMOND, Va. - (Oct. 17, 1996) - Signet Banking Corporation announced today that it is initiating a wide-ranging business redesign project to accelerate the companys transformation from a traditional regional bank to a national, information-based, financial company.  Known for its increasing use of direct response marketing for loan, deposit and investment products, Signet will transform its distribution channels and operating processes to achieve its new intermediary role.
<p>

	Malcolm S. McDonald, president and chief executive officer, said the companys current traditional bank infrastructure does not support Signets vision for the future.  "Its time we realigned our processes and delivery structures with our strategies," McDonald said.  He noted that one of the principal goals of the project would be to enhance revenue by shifting focus from products to customers. "We intend to become a customer-centered marketing organization.  Our success will depend on understanding exactly what the customer wants and delivering it through the most effective and efficient channels at a fair price."
<p>

	The project, led by T. Gaylon Layfield, III, vice chairman and chief operating officer, will begin with a comprehensive seven-month review followed by a twelve-to-eighteen month implementation period.  Layfield indicated that while outside consultants will be involved, the review will be driven by Signet employees.  "We are going to pull twenty of our key people out of their regular jobs full-time for seven months, and we will ask another forty or fifty of our managers to devote most of their time to the review effort.  In fact, all of our employees will be encouraged and given ways to participate in redesigning our company," Layfield said.  He added that specific cost and revenue targets will be announced only after the review has been completed.
<p>

	McDonald added, "While we expect this project to result in significant cost savings, its focus is not on arbitrary cuts.  We will eliminate positions only where we can discard redundant processes or improve them so that we enhance both productivity and customer service."  Signet has imposed an immediate hiring freeze to minimize layoffs.
<p>

	The company has engaged Aston Associates, a financial services consulting firm specializing in process redesign, to assist in the program.  Aston recently has completed highly successful redesign engagements at CoreStates Financial Corporation, a $43 billion banking organization head-quartered in Philadelphia, and First Security Corporation, a $13 billion company based in Salt Lake City.

<p>
<font size=+1>RICHMOND, Va. -- (July 18, 1996) -- Signet Banking Corporation today reported net income of $30.5 million for the second quarter of 1996, compared with $29.7 million for the second quarter of 1995.  Earnings per share equaled $.50 for both periods.   
<p>
	President and Chief Executive Officer Malcolm S. McDonald said that earnings reflect slower loan growth, in part a result of managements response to signs of potential market deterioration.  "In April, we expressed concern over uncertainty about the economy and an apparent shift in consumer behavior.  As a precaution, we delayed some of our more aggressive marketing programs while we reassessed market conditions and calibrated our models.   We have focused our efforts on improving product design and delivery and developing new customer management techniques.  We expect to resume more active marketing in the second half of the year."
<p>
	The managed loan portfolio, which includes loans and securitized assets, increased modestly in the second quarter.  The portfolio totaled $6.9 billion at June 30, 1996, compared with $6.8 billion at the end of the first quarter.  Growth in leasing and other specialty commercial segments offset the decreases in managed consumer loans.  
<p>
	Non-performing assets at June 30, 1996, totaled $54.9 million, or .92 percent of loans and foreclosed properties, down from $57.4 million a year earlier, but up from  $47.2 million at March 31, 1996.  During the quarter, Signet placed a real estate construction loan amounting to $8.4 million on non-accrual.
<p>
	Net charge-offs for the quarter were $13.8 million, or .95 percent of average loans.  Net charge-offs were $14.5 million, or 1.04 percent, in the previous quarter and $18.6 million, or 1.27 percent, in the 1995 second quarter.  At June 30, 1996, the allowance for loan losses totaled $126.4 million and was equal to 230 percent of non-performing assets and 2.1 percent of loans outstanding.
<p>
	Total revenues (net interest income and non-interest income) for the quarter were $181.2 million, compared with $160.4 million for the second quarter of 1995, and $174.3 million for the previous quarter.  During the quarter, a change in the earning asset mix narrowed Signets net interest margin by 16 basis points to 4.75 percent.  
<p>
	Non-interest expense for the second quarter was $121.5 million, compared with $111.4 million and $115.6 million, for the 1995 second quarter and the 1996 first quarter, respectively.  Signet continued to invest heavily in people and systems to build the infrastructure for information-based delivery.  
The return on equity was 14.5 percent and the efficiency ratio was 66.2 percent.  The return on average assets was 1.1 percent for the quarter.  At June 30, 1996,  Signets equity-to-asset ratio was 7.5 percent.

<CENTER><EM><H1>1996 Signet Shareholder Meeting Held; Highlights from 1995 Showcased
</H1></EM></CENTER>
<font size=+1>Richmond, Va.  (May 28, 1996)  Today, Signet Banking Corporation held its annual meeting. Shareholders of record as of April 15, 1996 voted to re-elect the companys 12 directors, approve a stock option plan for non-employee directors and ratify the selection of Ernst & Young as the companys independent auditors.
<p>
Signets president and chief operating officer, Malcolm S. McDonald, spoke briefly about the commercial loan fraud that was discovered in March of 1996, referring to it as a "severe disappointment, but not a roadblock" to the companys success. "It will not cause us to veer from out strategic course," McDonald said.  "In 1995, we accomplished a great deal of which we are very proud."
<p>
Among the highlights of Signets 1995 performance was the spin-off of its credit card division into Capital One Financial Corporation and the restructuring of the remainder of the company. McDonalds performance report focused on operating earnings which adjust for Capital One and the special charges for restructuring and fraud loss. "Accounting treatments for these events make it difficult to see the real changes that have taken place at Signet," McDonald said.  "Adjusting for these special charges provides a better indication of how our strategies for improving profitability are beginning to take hold."  He cited the following comparisons of 1995 and 1994 data as evidence of the companys success:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>strong growth in total revenues, up 22 percent from 1994 while expenses rose a modest 4 percent;
<LI>earnings per share of $1.98, a 37 percent increase;
<LI>an improvement in return on equity to 14.7 percent, up from 10 percent;
<LI>a decrease in the efficiency ratio of 13 points to 66 percent;
<LI>a robust, 26 percent loan growth in the average managed loan portfolio including securitized assets.
</UL>
<p>

"Our progress in expanding the use of information-based strategies throughout the company is most pleasing to me," McDonald said. "We built the first generation of proprietary models for marketing installment loans nationally through direct response channels, and our commercial group developed enhanced analytical tools for projecting the financial needs of customers in specialized businesses."
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Signet also used information-based strategies to:
<LI>introduce the nations first "wrap" account for smaller investors;
<LI>develop a state-of-the-art proprietary marketing system;
<LI>test pre-approved home equity line offers;
<LI>create interactive cash management using advanced imaging technology;
<LI>balance risk and opportunity in terms of loan growth by creating a credit culture based on quality, not quantity;
<LI>research and develop new paths for expanding customer relationships and future revenue growth.
</UL>
<p>
Signet conducted more than 750 information-based tests in 1995 and expects to see that number rise to 900 in 1996. The company spent $26 million in 1995 to build the infrastructure for this strategy and intends to spend $45 million in people, test offers and enhanced systems this year.
<p>
"Testing is the key to our information-based strategies," McDonald said. "Currently, there are about 90 analysts at Signet  trained in applied sciences, mathematics or statistics  who are developing our capability. We hope to double that number this year."
<p>
In 1996, the company expects to continue to concentrate efforts on selectively targeting new customers and developing account management programs to ensure that its customer relationships are profitable and characterized by service quality. "Although each of our businesses are small compared to the national marketplace, there is enormous potential for profitable growth as we develop greater expertise in target marketing," McDonald said.<BR>

   RICHMOND, Va. --  Signet Banking Corporation today reported earnings of $31.2 million, or $.52 per share, for the first quarter of 1996.  Net income rose 17 percent and earnings per share increased 16 percent over pro forma results for the first quarter of 1995.  Pro forma results of $26.7 million, or $.45 per share, for the first quarter of 1995 exclude Signets ownership of Capital One Financial Corporation, which was spun off to shareholders on February 28, 1995.<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert M. Freeman said, "We continue to grow and improve performance using information-based marketing strategies.  Stepped-up marketing of our consumer loan-by-check product contributed to substantial growth in the loan portfolio during the quarter." Including securitized assets, managed loans grew $352 million during the quarter and totaled $7 billion at March 31, 1996.  Freeman cautioned that growth in the loan-by-check product will slow somewhat in the coming months as the company tracks the new assets and assesses general economic conditions. <p>Non-performing assets at March 31, 1996, amounted to $47.2 million.  Non-performing assets decreased $7 million during the quarter and equaled .81 percent of balance sheet loans and foreclosed properties. Net charge-offs for the quarter were $14.5 million, or 1.04 percent of average loans.  The provision for loan losses totaled $11.3 million for the first quarter.  At March 31, 1996, the loan loss allowance of $126.4 million equaled 268 percent of non-performing assets and 2.18 percent of  loans outstanding.<p>Total revenues (net interest income and non-interest income) for the quarter were $174.3 million, up 12 percent from pro forma results in the 1995 first quarter. The net interest margin was 4.91 percent for balance sheet assets and 5.07 percent for managed assets.  On a pro forma basis, non-interest expense rose 4 percent to $115.6 million from $111.4 million in the first quarter of 1995. <p>	Focused marketing and re-engineering programs to enhance product offerings and delivery improved the efficiency ratio 4 percentage points from the first quarter of 1995 to 66 percent. The return on equity was 14.60 percent and the return on assets was 1.13 percent. At March 31, 1996, common equity equaled 7.19 percent of assets.<p>Signet is a $12 billion financial institution with headquarters in Richmond, Virginia.  The company offers a wide array of financial services through its Capital Markets, Commercial and Consumer Banking businesses. Signet has offices in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia, and markets several of its products nationally.</font><p>

	<font size=+1>RICHMOND, Va. -- (April 9, 1996) --  Signet Banking Corporation announced
today that its 1995 consolidated net income was $111 million, or $1.86 per
share, after adjusting for a pre-tax charge of $35 million in connection
with previously announced fraudulent loan transactions.  <p>

	Signet announced on March 19 that it was one of several major financial
institutions that were victims of fraudulent commercial loan transactions. 
Signet had loan outstandings related to these transactions of approximately
$81 million. The $35 million charge is an estimate based on federal
authority reports about assets restrained to date. The recoveries are
subject to a number of contingencies and may change in the near-term as
additional assets are recovered, additional claims are asserted, or the
market value of the restrained assets fluctuates.<p>

	The adjusted results are contained in Signet's annual report on Form 10-K,
which will be filed by Monday, April 15 and will be available upon request. 
The company's annual report to shareholders and proxy materials will be
mailed the week of April 22.  Signet's annual shareholder's meeting will be
held on Tuesday, May 28, at the Jefferson Hotel in Richmond, Virginia.<p>

	Signet is an $11 billion financial institution headquartered in Richmond. 
The company offers a wide array of financial services through its Capital
Markets, Commercial and Consumer Banking businesses.  Signet has offices in
Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia, and markets several of its
products nationally.</font><p><p><p><a href="newsrel.htm"><b>Other Signet News</b></a><p><em>Contact:			Teri Schrettenbrunner, Public Relations Director; (v) 804.771.7210;      (f) 804.771.7311<br>Teresa Jones, Investor Relations Director (v) 804.771.7650<br>e-mail <a href="mailto:signetpr@richmond.infi.net"> signetpr@richmond.infi.net </em> </a><br><p><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/banr_bar.jpg"></CENTER>

	RICHMOND, Va. -- Signet Banking Corporation announced today that it is the apparent victim of fraudulent commercial loan transactions amounting to $81 million.  The transactions are structured as loans to finance computer equipment leases in which the purported lessee is a Fortune 100 corporation, well known to Signet.  <BR><P>	Payments under the leases were assigned to Signet.  It is now believed that the documents obligating the lessee were forged.  Individuals claiming to be employees of the lessee were arrested today by Federal authorities.  At this time, all payments are current, but Signet is assessing the potential for loss under its $81 million exposure. 	Signet has sold or assigned without recourse to other financial institutions participations in similar transactions with the same parties, totaling approximately $173 million. The purported lessee is conducting its own independent investigation, and Signet is cooperating with Federal authorities in their investigation.<BR><P>

<BODY><H2>Signet Banking Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Up 15%</H2><I></I><P><P><a href="sig95q3.htm"> <b> Financial Highlights</b></a> | <a href="cis95q3.htm"><b> Consolidated Income Statement</b></a> | <a href="cbsq395.htm"><b>Consolidated Balance Sheet</b></a> <br><p>	<font size=+1>   RICHMOND, Va. -- (Oct. 19, 1995) -- Signet Banking Corporation today reported earnings of $30.1 million, or $.50 per share, for the third quarter of 1995.  The company reported earnings of $3.5 million, or $.05 per share, for the same period in 1994 and $29.7 million, or $.50 per share, for the second quarter of 1995.  Results for 1994 include special charges as well as the earnings of Capital One Financial Corporation which was spun off to shareholders on February 28, 1995.  Excluding both the special charges and Capital One, Signet's third quarter net income rose 15 percent from $26.3 million in the 1994 third quarter and earnings per share were up 11 percent from $.45.<p>   	Discussing the results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert M. Freeman said that the quarter reflects Signet's commitment to implementing an information-based strategy.  "We continued to invest our resources in building the infrastructure to carry out the marketing programs for our products and services and, in particular, worked to prepare for the expanded roll-out of our installment loan product which is scheduled to begin in November.  We completed the acquisition of the Sheffield companies, nationwide direct mail marketers of the Blanchard mutual funds and continue to test alternative ways of financing the needs of consumers and businesses."<p>   	Managed loans (balance sheet and securitized assets) grew 3 percent from the previous quarter.  Specialized lending accounted for most of the growth in the commercial loan portfolio, which grew $162 million, or 6 percent.  Net additions of $114 million of student, installment and home equity loans fueled a 4 percent increase in the consumer portfolio during the three months.   Signet continued to de-emphasize commercial real estate lending, and that portfolio declined 3 percent to $643 million from June 30, 1995.<p>   	Non-performing assets at September 30, 1995 totaled $51.5 million or .93 percent of loans and foreclosed properties, down 22 percent from $65.9 million a year earlier, and 10 percent from $57.4 million at June 30, 1995.   Net charge-offs for the quarter were $13.0 million, or .89 percent of average loans.  Charge-offs included $4.7 million related to commercial real estate loans, and $9.0 million for consumer loans.  At quarter-end, the loan loss reserve totaled $129.7 million and was equal to 251.77 percent of non-performing assets and 2.35 percent of loans outstanding.<br><p>   	Total revenues (net interest income and non-interest income) for the quarter were $164.0 million.  Adjusting for Capital One, total revenues were up 14 percent from the 1994 third quarter and 2 percent from the 1995 second quarter.  Signet's net interest margin was 4.96 percent, down from 5.14 percent in the previous quarter.  A shift in the earning asset mix during the third quarter accounted for 13 basis points of the reduction in margin.<br><p>	Non-interest expense for the third quarter was $109.5 million, down slightly from $111.4 million in the previous quarter.  Non-interest expense was reduced by a rebate of approximately $4.1 million on the company's FDIC premiums and increased by higher levels of expense associated with the testing of new products and services.  The efficiency ratio of 66 percent improved 10 points from the 1994 third quarter and 3 points from the previous quarter.  Re-engineering programs initiated in the second half of 1994 continue to benefit Signet's cost structure. <p>   	The third quarter return on equity was 14.5 percent and the return on average assets was 1.11 percent.  The equity-to-asset ratio was 7.59 percent.<p>	Signet is an $11 billion financial institution with headquarters in Richmond, Virginia.  The company offers a wide array of financial services through its Capital Markets, Commercial and Consumer Banking businesses.

<BODY><h2>Signet Banking Corporation Reports Strong Quarter<br><a href="finhigh.htm">Earnings Up 88% After Spin-Off</h2></a><p><font size=+1>	RICHMOND, Va. -- (July 19, 1995)Signet Banking Corporation reported earnings of $29.7 million, or $.50 per share, for the second quarter of 1995.  Excluding the contribution of Capital One Financial Corporation, which was spun off to shareholders on February 28, 1995, Signet's second-quarter net income rose 88 percent from $15.8 million in the 1994 second quarter and 11 percent from $26.7 million earned in the first three months of 1995.  On the same basis, earnings per share were up 79 percent from last year's second quarter and 11 percent from the first quarter of 1995.<p>	Including Capital One's contribution, Signet Banking Corporation reported earnings of $50.4 million, or $.88 per share, for the second quarter of 1994 and $42.2 million, or $.71 per share, for the first quarter of 1995. <p>	Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert M. Freeman was particularly gratified by the company's strong performance ratios.  "Last July we embarked on a plan to revitalize Signet.  We set interim targets--to bring our return on equity from a lackluster 10 percent to the 15 to 16 percent range and to reduce our efficiency ratio by 10 points by the fourth quarter of 1995.  We met both of these benchmarks in the second quarter and we experienced strong revenue growth as a result of innovative marketing.  Although we still have much work to do, we are increasingly confident that our information-based strategies will transform the company into a highly profitable marketer of financial services."<p>	The return on equity for the second quarter was 15.0 percent and the efficiency ratio improved 11 percentage points to 68.67 percent.  The return on average assets was 1.14 percent for the quarter.  Signet's equity-to-asset ratio increased to 7.70 percent from 7.36 percent at March 31, 1995.<p>	Non-performing assets at June 30, 1995 totaled $57.4 million or 1.01 percent of loans and foreclosed properties, down from $77.7 million a year earlier, but up from $41.6 million at March 31, 1995.  During the quarter, Signet placed two commercial real estate loans totaling $22 million on non-accrual.<p>	Net charge-offs for the quarter were $18.6 million, or 1.27 percent of average loans.  Charge-offs included $13.9 million related to the sale of $55 million of real-estate-related loans, for which Signet had previously accrued sufficient reserves.  At quarter-end, the loan loss reserve totaled $136.5 million and was equal to 238 percent of non-performing assets and 2.40 percent of loans outstanding.<p>	Total revenues (net interest income and non-interest income) for the quarter were $160.4 million.  Adjusting for Capital One, total revenues were up 23 percent from the 1994 second quarter and 3 percent from the first quarter.  Signet's net interest margin was5.14 percent, down from 5.40 percent in the previous quarter.  The first quarter margin benefited 21 basis points from an interest rate swap that expired at the end of March and 10 basis points from consumer loans booked on Signet's balance sheet and transferred to Capital One at the end of the first quarter.<p>	Non-interest expense for the second quarter was $111.4 million.  Excluding Capital One from historical data, non-interest expense was unchanged from the first quarter of 1995 and $3.1 million lower than the 1994 second quarter.  Staff reductions and re-engineering programs initiated after the second quarter of 1994 were responsible for improving Signet's cost structure. <p>	Loans grew at a healthy pace despite the continuing de-emphasis of commercial real estate lending.  During the quarter, the loan portfolio (loans and assets held for securitization) increased $337.1 million, or 6 percent, to $6.1 billion. Installment loans marketed through direct mail fueled consumer loan growth and focused marketing of leasing products accounted for increased commercial loans.<p>	Signet is a $10.5 billion financial institution with headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. The company offers a wide array of financial services through its Capital Markets, Commercial and Consumer Banking businesses. Signet has offices in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia, and markets several of its products nationally.</font><p><p><P><em>Contact:			Teri Schrettenbrunner, Public Relations Director; (v) 804.771.7210;      (f) 804.771.7311<br>Teresa Jones, Investor Relations Director (v) 804.771.7650<br>e-mail <a href="mailto:signetpr@richmond.infi.net"> signetpr@richmond.infi.net </em> </a><br><p><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/banr_bar.jpg"></center>

<p>

<font size=+1>RICHMOND, Va. - (April 19, 1995) -- Signet Banking Corporation today

reported earnings of $42.2 million, or $.71 per share, for the first quarter of

1995 compared with $53.1 million, or $.93 per share, for the same period last

year.  Reported current results include Signet's interest in Capital One

Financial Corporation for the two months prior to the spin-off on February 28,

1995; historical results include the operations of Capital One as a division of

Signet Banking Corporation.

<p>

Excluding the contributions of Capital One from both periods, Signet's net

income grew 48 percent in the 1995 first quarter to $26.7 million compared with

$18.0 million for the first quarter in 1994.  On the same basis, earnings for

the three months were $.45 per share compared with $.31 per share in 1994, a

gain of 45 percent.

<p>

Commenting on the quarter, Robert M. Freeman, chairman and chief executive

officer, cited Signet's focus on its consumer and commercial banking businesses

in the wake of the spin-off of its very successful credit card business.

"Signet's results are indicative of the progress of the re-engineering program

we instituted last summer as well as early success from our innovative

approaches to business development.  During the quarter, we added about $190

million in consumer and commercial loan outstandings, improved our efficiency

ratio seven and one-half points, and maintained Signet's excellent credit

quality."

<p>

The reported return on assets (ROA) was 1.39 percent and the reported return

on equity (ROE) was 17.09 percent.  Excluding Capital One, the ROA and ROE for

the first quarter of 1995 were 1.06 percent and 14.34 percent, respectively,

compared with .82 percent and 8.85 percent in 1994.  Signet's equity-to-asset

ratio was 7.36 percent at March 31, 1995.

<p>

Non-performing assets totaled $41.6 million, or .74 percent of loans and

foreclosed properties, at March 31, 1995.  Non-performing assets declined $46.8

million from the first quarter of 1994 and $6.9 million since December 31,

1994.  Net charge-offs for the first three months totaled $6.0 million, or .33

percent of average loans.  Excluding Capital One, net charge-offs for the first

three months totaled $2.8 million, or .19 percent of average loans.  The

allowance for loan losses at quarter-end of $151.7 million, or 2.69 percent of

net loans, equaled 575 percent of non-performing loans and 365 percent of

non-performing assets.

<p>

Total revenues (net interest income and non-interest income) for the quarter

were up 3 percent from the first quarter of 1994 on a reported basis.

Adjusting for Capital One, Signet's total revenues increased 18 percent as a

result of healthy loan growth and an improved balance sheet mix.  Total loans,

including loans held for sale and for securitization, amounted to $6.0 billion

at March 31, 1995, compared with $5.8 billion at December 31, 1994, and $4.6

billion at March 31, 1994.

<p>

The reported net interest margin for the quarter was 5.40 percent.  Signet's

net interest margin excluding Capital One, was 5.42 percent compared with 4.73

percent for the fourth quarter of 1994.  Higher average consumer loans boosted

Signet's margin by 40 basis points.  The margin included 21 basis points from

an interest rate hedge which expired in March 1995, and 10 basis points from

certain credit card loans booked on Signet's balance sheet and participated to

Capital One during the quarter and transferred to Capital One at March 31.

<p>

Reported non-interest expense for the first quarter amounted to $190.9

million.  Excluding Capital One, Signet's non-interest expense for the three

months ended March 31, 1995 was $111.4 million compared with $110.0 million and

$117.5 million, respectively, for the first quarter and fourth quarters of

1994.  Signet's non-interest expense increased 1 percent from the first quarter

of 1994, and decreased 5 percent from the fourth quarter of 1994 as a result of

the company's program to redesign business processes. 

<p>

Signet Banking Corporation is a $10 billion multi-bank holding company that

offers a wide variety of financial services through its Capital Markets,

Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking businesses.  Headquartered in Richmond,

Va., the company's primary market area is the District of Columbia, Maryland

and Virginia.  Several of Signet's products also are marketed nationally.

<H1><EM>Meeting Community Needs Through Products and Services</em></h1>
<p>
<font size=+2>Small Business</font><BR>
<font size=+1>Signet's Small Business Unit takes a proactive approach in dealing with customers. Rather than solely lending money, the group helps small businesses solve financial problems and reach their goals through consultation and education.
<p>
<font size=+2>Government Loan Center</font><BR>
Our Government Loan Center assists entrepreneurs, small business owners, and key managers to identify, understand and apply for the best government loan program that meets their needs. The program recognizes the pressures faced by small businesses, particularly those owned by minorities and women. Through the Government Loan Center, we have successfully funneled more capital to these companies.
<p>
In addition, we hired a Spanish-speaking business development officer in 1995. She is conducting an extensive calling program with Hispanic small business communities and other minority businesses.
<p>
<font size=+2>Small Business Administration</font><BR>
We also participate in government loan program such as the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 7(a), SBA's Low Doc Quick and Easy Loan Program, SBA's 504 Loan Program, SBA's Contract Financing Program, and U.S. Department of Agriculture, FHA business and Industrial Loan Programs. In Maryland, we participate in the SBA's Preferred Lender Program. In 1996, we hope to achieve a preferred status in Virginia as well as in the Metro Washington area.
<p>
<font size=+2>Small Business Checking Account</font><BR>
For smaller and less capitalized businesses, we offer a Small Business Checking Account with a flat monthly service charge, instead of per-check charges. Since the monthly service charge does not vary, this product helps small businesses manager their costs.
<p>
<font size=+2>Small Business Education</font><BR>
We offer seminars and workshops on financing and entrepreneurship across our communities. For instance, we have continued our work with women business owners through sponsorship of forums such as The Women's Business Conference Plus, a government contracting workshop presented in partnership with the Richmond Small Business Development Center. We also have worked with the Richmond Council for Minority Business Development in sponsoring a program to celebrate and recognize the achievements of minority businesses.
<p>
Signet also has created partnerships with several Schools of Business --Virginia State University, Virginia Union University and J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College -- in which our officers provide workshops on entrepreneurship and marketing. Finally, we have worked with groups such as the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development in creating its Microenterprise Loan Program and conducting Virginia Enterprise Initiative workshop session.
<p>
<font size=+2>Minority Suppliers</font><BR>
<font size=+1>Signet has a long-standing relationship with both the Virginia and MD/DC Regional Minority Supplier Development Councils. Through the years, our officers have served in many elected capacities in these organizations. We also continue to fund annual scholarships for minority entrepreneurs to Dartmouth College's Minority Business Executive Institute, and to participate in the National Business Consortium Fund program.
<p>
<font size=+2>Commercial Lending</font><BR>
For those companies that generally do not have the financial strength to obtain traditional unsecured financing, Signet's Commercial Finance Division is able to help. These smaller, less capitalized firms usually have specific credit needs that traditionally cannot be addressed by conventional financing.
<p>
Signet offers special loans that are secured by a company's accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment. By providing financing to companies that otherwise may not be able to obtain loans, we help these businesses to survive and even to expand.
<P>
<font size=+2>Real Estate</font><BR>
During 1995, Signet made resources available for real estate loans to finance the construction of multi-family housing. Recognizing that safe and affordable units are an important component of urban housing, we have developed specialized lenders who work with for-profit and nonprofit partners in bringing these complex deals to fruition.
<p>
<font size=+2>Signet Mortgage</font><BR>
Signet Mortgage Corporation (SMC) is dedicated to providing specialized product that meet the needs of all prospective home buyers. In addition to offering conventional financing, SMC participates in cooperative lending programs with other financial institutions and works with nonprofit organizations and financial intermediaries to extend financing for the production and retention of affordable housing units.
<P>
Our mortgage company also participating in various federal government programs, including Veterans Administration and Federal Housing Administration programs in all regions, as well as state and local government programs such as the Community Development Administration in Maryland, the Virginia Housing Development Authority, and the District of Columbia's Home Purchase Assistance Program.
<P>
<font size=+2>UpFront Loan</font><sup>SM</sup><BR>
Signet offers the UpFront Loan, in conjunction with a number of mortgage programs, to assist qualified first-time and low- to moderate-income home buyers with down payment and closing cost obligations. The UpFront Loan eases the cash requirements for home buyers by providing an unsecured loan for down payment and closing costs over and above the buyer's ability to pay. Repayment can be extended to five years to increase affordability for borrowers.
<p>
<font size=+2>Community Home Buyers Program</font><BR>
The Community Home Buyer's Program provides a package of benefits to assist first-time and low- to moderate home buyers. Only three percent (3%) of the sale price as a down payment must be from the borrower's own funds, versus a typical conventional loan which requires a five percent (5%) down payment. The program also waives the two-month payment reserve requirement and provides home ownership counseling through qualified sources. Thus, the potential buyer benefits from more flexible underwriting criteria. Signet participates in this program with General Electric Mortgage Insurance Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae).
<P>
<font size=+2>Energy Efficient Mortgage</font><BR>
Signet participates in the FHA/HUD pilot program to provide an Energy Efficient Mortgage. The product allows home buyers to make energy-efficient upgrades to older homes and helps the owner to manager utility costs. The program rewards buyers of new homes by adding the dollar amount of energy-efficient upgrades to the mortgage loan balance, although the borrower needs to qualify only for the purchase price of the home.
<p>
<font size=+2>Approved HomeBuyer</font><sup>SM</sup><BR>
Signet's Approved HomeBuyer program enables prospective buyers to get a pre-approved mortgage. With a formal loan approval and the commitment for mortgage funds, the prospective buyer has the negotiating power of a cash buyer. It's a great way for first-time and low- to moderate-income buyers to determine how much they can afford before they shop for a home. Plus, an option for extended rate protection also is available.
<p>
<font size=+2>SlamDunk Mortgage</font><sup>SM</sup><BR>
In 1995, Signet introduced an exciting new mortgage product targeted to first-time and low- to moderate-income home buyers in Washington, D.C. The SlamDunk Mortgage provides prospective buyers with a lower down payment option, a below market interest rate, and flexible underwriting guidelines. It also removes some of the obstacles to home buying such as cash reserves and minimum loan amounts.
<p>
<font size=+2>Settlement Expense Loan Program (SELP)</font><BR>
In Maryland, Signet participate in the Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and State of Maryland Settlement Expense Loan Programs. These programs are designed to assist first-time and low- to moderate-income home buyers with the high cost of a home purchase. 
<p>
<font size=+2>Housing Acquisition Rehabilitation Program (HARP)</font><BR>
In Maryland, Signet's Housing Acquisition Rehabilitation Program is an innovative product the enables a buyer to get a mortgage loan and at the same time get the financing needed to complete necessary repairs. HARP makes older home more attractive and affordable to prospective home buyers, while also helping to improve our urban communities.
<p>
<font size=+2>Home Purchase Assistance Program (HPAP)</font><BR>
Signet has been approved to provide mortgage loans in combination with the District of Columbia's Home Purchase Assistance Program. HPAP loans require a minimum down payment and provide subsidized secondary financing to help reduce monthly mortgage payments. Signet also is a participating lender in the City's Fannie Mae Approved Employee-Assisted Housing Program
<p>
<font size=+2>HomeSTART</font><BR>
Signet is a participating lender in Virginia's Home START program which provides second mortgages to finance down payment and closing costs for lower-income first-time home buyers. The program is administered through nonprofits, housing authorities and local governments throughout Virginia. Signet combines primary mortgages to financing down payments and closing costs for lower-income first-time home buyers. The program is administered through nonprofits, housing authorities and local governments throughout Virginia. Signet combines primary mortgages with the HomeSTART loan to create affordable financing for first-item and low- to moderate-income home buyers.
<p>
<font size=+2>NeighborWorks</font><BR>
Signet has established and expanded important relationships with NeighborWorks affiliate organizations in Baltimore and Salisbury, Maryland and Richmond, Virginia. Through these partnerships, we have provided local communities with special affordable housing programs sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Neighborhood Housing Services of America.
<p>
<font size=+2>Housing Intermediaries and Tax Credits</font><BR>
Perhaps one of the greatest obstacles for many affordable housing developers is access to sufficient equity for a project. We recognized our role in providing equity financing, and we are a consistent partner with national nonprofit housing intermediaries like the Local Initiative Support Corporation and Enterprise Foundation. Our continuing investments in the National Equity Fund and the Maryland Housing Equity Fund II are combined with investments from corporations across the country to fill funding gaps for a variety of lower-income projects throughout Maryland and Virginia. Likewise, Signet investments, such as those in the Virginia Housing Equity Fund, continue to stretch beneficial project financing to the point where the numbers "work" and affordable housing units are completed.
<p>
<font size=+2>Housing Consortia</font><BR>
In all of our major markets, we participate in a variety of multibank and private consortia designed to benefit lower-income individuals. Each of these groups strives to provide affordable housing and neighborhood development in local jurisdictions. Of particular note are community development corporations found in markets including Baltimore, the Eastern Shore, the District of Columbia, Danville, Northern Virginia, Southwest Virginia, Richmond, Hampton Roads and Roanoke.
<p>
<font size=+2>Consumer Lending</font><BR>
We provide secured and unsecured installment lending for a variety of purposes, including home improvement, home equity and automobile purchases.
<p>
<font size=+2>Loan-By-Check</font><BR>
We recognize that members of our community need a quick, convenient way to borrow money.  In 1994, we introduced the pre-approved Signet Instant Loan-By-Check product. With Loan-By-Check, qualified candidates can get a loan with the same convenience as making a deposit.
<p>
Pre-approved candidates receive a direct mail solicitation that includes a check for the full loan amount and a note that describes all the terms and conditions of the loan.  By endorsing and depositing the check to any checking or savings account, the customer agrees to the provisions in the note. Once the check clears, the customer receives a coupon book printed with the payment due date. In three easy steps, the customer has obtained an unsecured personal loan at a competitive interest rate.
<p>
<font size=+2>Agricultural Lending</font><BR>
We offer farm loans to creditworthy borrowers to support a variety of agricultural purposes. These loans are available in our rural markets, specifically in Southern, Southwest and Northern Neck Virginia and on the Eastern Shore or Maryland and Virginia.
<p>
Crop production loans, small equipment financing and agricultural warehouse loans are available to assist area farmers.
<p>
In addition, we work to identify rural needs through activities such as our long-term relationship with the Virginia Water Project, a nationally acclaimed organization that addresses rural water and waste water needs throughout Virginia and the Southeast United States.</font>

<font size=+1>Sometimes it just makes good sense to join forces with other financial institutions and community grops to make a neighborhood vision come true.  By combining resources and expertise, groups can tackle projects that are large or complex.  One suce project is Nehemiah Estate Cooperative - a limited-equity cooperative in the Columbia Heights section of Washington, D.C.
<p>
Developed by Project LEND (Lenders Efforts for Non-profit Development) and WISH (Washington Innercity Self Help), the Nehemiah Estate Cooperative offers 32 one- or two- bedroom units for families with income of less than $40,000. Nehemiash Estate Cooperative adds much-needed affordable housing in this working-class neighborhood of Northwest D.C.  Signet participated in the $1.2 million financing of the complex as a part of Project LEND, a consortium of Washington lenders that has added over 300 affordable housing units to the D.C. market since 1990. Project LEND works with nonprofit sponsors as a "one stop" vehicle to facilitate acquisition, construction, and permanent financing for qualified projects.  Signet is a founding member.
<p>
Project LEND's partner in Nehemiah Estate Cooperative is WISH, a Washington non-profit group that develops cooperatives, subsidized housing, and rental buildings in D.C. downtown neighborhoods with diverse ethnic populations.  A group with strong community roots, WISH helps tenants organize to secure building maintenance or convert the property to a cooperative purchase.
<p>
"And in the case of Nehemiah," says Paul Battle, Director of WISH, "over 50% of the Nehemiah Cooperative units are being occupied by local residents of Columbia Heights."
<p>
"Project LEND is committed to projects that are integral to neighborhood revitalization and preserving quality housing," said Jean Liss, Signet's representative for Project LEND.  "Each new addition to a neighborhood takes the residents one step closer to a stronger, more viable community."
<p>
Signet, Project LEND, and WISH represent a partnership that is making a visible difference in the Columbia Heights neighborhood and Washington, D.C.

<font size=+1>Large homes, tree-lined streets and spacious front porches welcome you to Barton Heights, a Northside neighborhood in Richmond, Virginia.  Founded long ago as one of the city's early suburbs, the area has fallen into decline over the years, but remains a neighborhood with a strong identity.  Today, a rebirth of Barton Heights is underway through the efforts of Richmond Neighborhood Housing Services, Signet, and other community partners.
<p>
Coming to Barton Heights over 10 years ago, RNHS embarked with mixed success on many community projects, including emergency home repair and rehabilitation.  With the motto "Changing community liabilities into neighborhood assets," the group worked with both elderly residents and newcomers to create a safe and viable living environment.
<p>
"The ultimate beneficiaries were the families who had access to a better quality of life," says Signet's Pat Hickman.  "But results were mixed and resources were limited."
<p>
Enter Greta Harris - current RNHS Executive Director - who came with a new vision and enormous enthusiasm.  Striving to put the organization on a "fast track" to success, Harris asked Signet to join Richmond Neighborhood Housing Services in launching a fundraising drive and developing a new loan product.
<p>
"The RNHS Board came to the realization that resource development and new loan production were critical to long-term success," explains Hickman.
<p>
The results have been impressive.  Since 1993, emergency repair grants have been issued and home improvement loans and down payment assistance have been awarded.  More than $900,000 in real estate development projects have been completed; $1.7 million of permanent financing has been leveraged.  Over 300 residents have been included in community outreach endeavors.  RNHS also has launched NOW - Neighborhood Ownership Works - a first mortgage program that already is approaching $1 million in commitments.
<p>
To help RNHS remain viable, the organization has launched a corporate campaign to raise $500,000 in three years.  Signet stepped to the plate with a $50,000 contribution and our CEO Robert Freeman introduced the organization to an array of corporate leaders who also were concerned about the health and stability of Richmond communities.<BR>

<p>
<font size=+1>"I learned how to repair a leaky faucet today," exclaimed Julie Seward, Signet's Corporate Community Reinvestment Officer, as she walked between "how-to" classes at Northumberland High School.  Plumbing repair was only one of numerous courses at the Northern Neck Housing Conference held last March in Heathsville, Virginia.
<p>
Nestled among the rural localities near the Chesapeake Bay, the Northern Neck area has many neighborhoods in its five counties where affordable housing and home ownership are important issues.  In response to local interest, Signet, other local banks, Virginia Extension Service, and Virginia Housing Development Authority sponsored this first regional conference to showcase housing opportunities and promote home ownership.
<p>
"The response was tremendous - more than we ever would have dreamed," said Michelle Faulkner, Signet coordinator for the event.
<p>
More than 100 people spent the day learning about home buying and understanding credit, do-it-yourself home maintenance, mortgage loan products, and housing rehabilitation.  Children were treated to planned activities as adults learned from a variety of local bankers and tradespeople.  Special emphasis was placed on discussion about home mortgage products for people with limited income.
<p>
With <a href="http://www.signet.com/perfinance/branch.htm">branches </a>throughout the Northern Neck, Signet was an active participant on the planning committee. "Community and business people who helped on this wanted to present practical information that would be of value to the many working people in the area," says Gail Haynie, Conference Chair.
<p>
An evaluation of the day gave high marks to the effort. the partnership between Signet, local businesses, and community agencies produced positive results. People already are talking about making the Northern Neck Housing Conference an annual event.</font>

<p>
<font size=+1> For 18 students who formed the first class of the Back to Basics Inc. (BTB) program, it was a day of dreams realized.  After completing a rigorous nine-month curriculum in preparation for a career in medical transcription, these residents of West Baltimore were well on their way to self-sufficiency.For Signet, the closing ceremony of the BTB program signified the culmination of a partnership that began almost five years ago.
<p>
  It was a wonderful opportunity for us to witness a dream come true for so many people, said Kenneth H. Trout, President of Signets Maryland region. It was proof positive that the public and private sectors can work together in a real collaborative effort toward the common goal of a healthier, stronger community.
<p>
Founded by Reverend Althinia Hunt and Reverend Vera C. Waters, BTB works to break the cycle of dependence on public assistance by providing students with marketable job skills in the growing field of medical transcription. In addition to technical skills training, the program also provides life planning education and counseling as well as career placement assistance.  
<p>
Signet was the first corporation to step forward, providing the initial 30 computers and start-up funding for the project.  Since that time, we have provided additional financial support and have assisted BTB with numerous hours of business and technical guidance and planning. In addition, we have helped the programs founders to find and solicit other sources of funding from new project partners.Signet hopes that the program will serve as a model for similar programs in other Baltimore communities and throughout the country. 
<p>
 We believe that skills training  which leads to jobs  can only strengthen the quality of life for our citizens.  And productive citizens become our best banking customers, said Trout of the BTB program benefits. 
<p>
Since Signets initial sponsorship, additional partners have joined BTBs vision of self-sufficiency and employment for residents of Baltimores public housing.  Recently, BTB received word that it will be allocated funding by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide additional financial support for its programs over the next five years.
<p>
Were proud that we saw the power of Reverend Hunts and Reverend Waters vision and believed in their knowledge of the needs of the community, said Trout of Signets community reinvestment involvement. By doing so weve been able to serve as a grassroots participant in an effort to find an innovative, workable solution that prepares our citizens for the workplace.

<img src="images/logobchr.jpg" align=right><IMG SRC="images/banr_bar.jpg"><P><h1>Signet Banking Corporation</h1><h2 align=center>Introduction 1994 Annual Report</h2><FONT SIZE=+3>S</FONT><font size=+1>ignet Banking Corporation (Signet) is a $10.5 billion multi-bank holding company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under thesymbol "SBK." Headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, Signet offers a wide varietyof financial services through our Capital Markets, Commercial and Consumer Banking businesses. Our primary market area is the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia, although several of our business units market their products nationally. <p>Since 1988, Signet has been investing in information-based strategies and developing databases that are used to target customers. Our strategy is simple--based on each customer profile we offer the best priced product possible with the least amount of risk to the bank. We tested this concept in our credit card business, and in 1993 it began to pay off substantially. We became the fastest growing credit card issuer in the nation. At the end of 1992, we had $2.2 billion in managed credit card loans, at the end of 1993,$5.1 billion and at the end of 1994, $7.7 billion. <p>The success of this strategy led to Signet's metamorphosis in 1994. As our credit card business grew to be among the top 15 in the nation, we had to make some tough decisions about how best to manage this growth to maximize shareholder value. <p>On July 27, 1994, we announced our intention to establish our credit card division as an independent company--Capital One Financial Corporation--and eventually spin it off to our shareholders. In mid-November, we offered shares of the new company through an initial public offering (IPO) designed to raise equity. On February 28, 1995, we completed the spin-off when we transferred Signet's ownership in Capital One Financial Corporation directly to Signet shareholders.The companies now operate independently.<p>When reading financial reports, use the following as a guide:<ul><li>Until mid-November, the credit card business was 100% owned by Signet Banking Corporation and operated as a division of Signet Bank/Virginia.<p><li>For the remainder of 1994 (after the IPO) and until February 28, 1995, 88.5% of the credit card business was owned by Signet Banking Corporation and 11.5% was owned by the new shareholders of Capital One Financial Corporation.</ul><p>Our <a href="letter.htm"><b>Letter to Shareholders</b></a> will give you an overview of 1994, and <a href="spinqa.htm"><b>Spin-Off Questions and Answers</b></a> will discuss the separation process in more depth.

<h2>A New Bank Chartered in 1795 becomes Signet</h2>
<p>
<font size=+1>"An Act to establish a bank, and incorporate the subscribers 
thereto" passed 24th December, 1795	"And be it enacted, That all 
such persons as shall become subscribers to the said bank, their 
successors and assigns, shall be and are hereby created and made a 
corporation and body politic, by the name and style of The President, 
Directors and Company of the Bank of Baltimore."	
<p>
That institution, the Bank of Baltimore, is the direct ancestor of 
Signet Bank/Maryland, the oldest bank in Maryland, the eighth oldest 
in America.<p>	What sort of world did the fledgling bank enter?  
What was going on along the shores of the Patapsco?  First of all, 
there wasn't even a Baltimore City then; the city wasn't officially 
incorporated until December 1796.  Instead, today's Inner Harbor was 
dotted with several competing communities.  Yes, there was Baltimore 
Town, founded in 1729.  But there was also Jones Town, a settlement 
established in 1732.  And, of course, there was Fells Point, founded 
by Edward Fell in 1763 on a 1000-acre point of land his father William 
had acquired back in 1731.  The Fells were shipbuilders and saw that 
their water-lapped peninsula and 16-foot deep harbor would be ideal for 
launching ships and ideal for trade.
<p>	
Recall that this was the era of the famed Baltimore clipper, a ship one 
maritime historian has called "the most spectacular event in the history 
of naval architecture."  No wonder, then, that John Adams, future 
president but then delegate to the Continental Congress meeting in 
Baltimore, with good Boston pithiness, noted in his diary, 
"This afternoon I walked to Fells Point, the place where the ships lie."
	Ships and trade helped Baltimore Town --and Jones Town and Fells 
Point and eventually Baltimore City--become a boom town in the late 
18th century, and by 1771 a Philadelphia merchant was complaining that 
Baltimore's aggressive businessmen had "within a few years past carried 
off from this city almost the whole trade of Frederick, York, Bedford, 
and Cumberland counties."<p>	Wheat was replacing tobacco as the cash 
crop for Maryland farmers, and Baltimore's location on the Fall Line--
and the attendant swift-flowing streams--made it an ideal spot for grist 
mills.  Moreover, local landowners took advantage of several large iron 
ore deposits and helped Baltimore become one of America's earliest 
industrial centers.<p>	Ship building, wheat milling, and iron smelting 
made Baltimore's citizens rich, so rich that in 1789 the merchant Robert 
Long was able to boast with confidence that "from its peculiar local 
advantages [Baltimore] promises soon to arrive at a degree of opulence 
unrivaled on this side of the Atlantic."  The 1790 census put the city's 
population at 13,509, building was rampant, and land speculation founded 
several local fortunes.  The great French writer La Rouchefoucald 
commented in 1796 that Baltimore contained "four to five thousand 
houses and has been almost entirely built since the peace of 1763...
the town spreads every day towards the harbour, and in the west side 
upon the grounds belonging to Col. Howard, their value from this 
circumstance increases continually."	<p>Clearly all this prosperity 
created a demand for a bank capable of handling the finances of this 
growing city, and recall that 1796 was the year after the Bank of
 Baltimore was founded.  George Salmon was the bank's first president; 
its first cashier was James Cox.  The centennial history of the bank 
described Cox as "highly esteemed for his official integrity and 
personal merit" which sounds like standard puffery but is later given 
the ring of truth for the writer went on to humanize the cashier, 
calling him "of a nervous temperament, quick in action, with marked 
peculiarity of character."	<p>The names of the gentlemen who served 
as the first board of directors suggest the cosmopolitan nature of 
Baltimore: there are the predictable English families like Ridgely, 
but there is a Scot (Stewart), a Jew (Etting), and a brace of Frenchmen 
(Pascault and Ghequiere).	These men made their office in a 
3-1/2 story brick building on the northeast corner of Market 
(now Baltimore) Street and what was pastorally called St. Paul's Lane.
  Their new bank had a capital of $1,200,000 divided into 400 
shares of $300 each.<p>	Coincidentally--or maybe not--1795 not only 
saw the birth of the Bank of Baltimore, but it also saw the birth of 
George Peabody (of Institute fame) and of someone called Johns Hopkins.

<p><font SIZE=+2><EM><STRONG>History of Signet -- 1815</STRONG></EM></font>
</p>
<p>
<font size=+1>"Oh! Say can you see ..."	Those words and the war that 
sparked them dominated this period of Maryland's history.  And of the Bank 
of Baltimore's history, too.
<p>
But there was more to the federal period, 1795-1815, than bombs bursting 
in air.  There was trade in the air as well, and Baltimore's prosperous 
port drew thousands of ambitious young men and women, eager to share in the
 city's continuous growth.  And grow Baltimore did: at this time it was, 
in fact, the fastest growing city in America, doubling its population 
(to 26,514) in the decade 1790-1800 and nearly doubling it again (to 46,000)
 by 1815.  Capitalists were quick to see profit here, and by 1810 
Baltimore boasted eight banks -- twice as many as any other city in the 
country!
<p>
	Baltimore, however, was more than just a place to make money.  
The years after the Revolution saw it pass Annapolis as the cultural 
capital of Maryland, attracting American's finest painters, architects, 
silversmiths, and cabinet makers.	
<p>
Nor did Marylanders live for wealth and display alone: the state was 
then home to Elizabeth Ann Seton (1774-1821) who came to Baltimore 
in 1808, founded an American branch of the French order of St. Vincent 
de Paul, and started St. Joseph's College in Emmitsburg.  Since her death 
three miracles of healing have been attributed to her intervention, and 
she was canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1975 -- America's only saint.
<p>
	A return to commerce finds that these were the years when 
Johns Hopkins was getting started making his millions.  Hopkins, a 
customer and stockholder of the Bank of Baltimore, often remarked that 
<EM><STRONG>
"but for the assistance rendered by the Bank of Baltimore"
</STRONG></EM> 
he would have been wiped out more than once.  For this era was subject to 
financial panics more virulent, fortunately, than we know today: between 
1814 and 1820 nine out of Maryland's 21 banks failed; nationwide, half 
the banks founded between 1810 and 1820 went bust by 1825.  But  the Bank 
of Baltimore weathered it all and kept on regularly paying its 
stockholders dividends that ranged between 10 and 12%.	
<p>
The Bank of Baltimore's continued success can in part be explained by its 
second president, William Wilson, who served from 1807 to 1824.  
Historian George Howard wrote, 
<EM><STRONG>
"William Wilson was one of the noblest and best of men.  He was 
distinguished for his urbanity, his uprightness and beneficence ... 
He has left a record of which his family is legitimately proud, and to 
which Baltimore may point as an honorable chapter in the history of her 
commercial men."</STRONG></EM>	Wilson had journeyed to Baltimore 
from Ireland in 1770 and established the firm William Wilson and Sons, 
a shipping firm which carried on an extensive trade with Calcutta and 
other East India ports, Holland, England, Brazil, the West Coast of 
South America, and China.	<p>Wilson's integrity is still legendary: 
the Bank of Baltimore's board met on September 6, 1813, in part to discuss 
Wilson's salary.  That salary had been fixed at $3,000 a year back in 1801, 
but Wilson drew only $1,200 a year, saying he didn't need any more!
<p>
	War, however, is what this era is best remembered for, and when the 
War of 1812 did come, the Bank of Baltimore and its officers did their 
part.  On May 8, 1813, the bank allocated $100,000 for the defense of the 
city.  The citizens then sat tight to wait.  They didn't have to wait 
long, for British admiral Sir George Cockburn soon sailed into the 
Chesapeake with orders 
<EM><STRONG>
"to destroy and lay waste such towns and districts on the coasts as might 
be assailable."
</STRONG></EM>
  Taking no chances, the city's bankers met on September 1, 1814, and 
passed a resolution that began <EM><STRONG>"Whereas, The banks of this 
city have deemed it prudent at the present juncture to remove their 
specie into the interior ..."
</STRONG></EM>
<p>
Baltimoreans were able to stop the British advance twice -- on land at 
the Battle of North Point and on water at Fort McHenry.  Francis 
Scott Key gained immortality at the latter as did General John Stricker
 at the former, where he served as commander of the City Brigade.  
General Stricker would later serve with equal distinction as third 
president of the Bank of Baltimore.  In 1815, his name was inscribed 
at the base of the new Battle Monument at Calvert and Fayette 
streets -- just one block from the where Signet's headquarters in 
Maryland would be.

The Story of Signet -- Constructing a Bank Headquarters During the 
Depression</EM>
</H1>
</CENTER>
<font size=+1>	It's easy to forget that building projects, now 
virtually a matter of course, were not always standard procedure. 
The construction of Signet's first headquarters building, the branch on 
the corner of Richmond's Eighth and Main Streets, could hardly have been 
more controversial.
<p>
	When founded in 1922, the Morris Plan Bank of Richmond's main 
building was on the Northwest corner of Eight and Main Streets, in the 
former lobby of the old Stumpf Hotel. However, by 1928 the Morris Plan 
Bank of Richmond had become the Morris Plan Bank of Virginia, the state's 
only branch banking enterprise. The bank was now occupying a full four 
floors of space in the old hotel building. There was still some room 
left for expansion, but Thomas Boushall, president and founder of 
Signet's predecessor, had decided that the bank was worthy of its own 
headquarters building. Few suspected that the 1929 Wall Street crash 
was in the offing as Boushall began his search for a construction site.
<p>
	In 1931, just as the Depression began to take hold in Virginia, the 
bank completed the purchase of the Northeast corner of Eighth and Main, 
just one block west from Virginia's financial crossroads. Boushall bought 
103 feet of space on Main Street and 108 feet on Eighth Street, at three 
thousand dollars per front foot.	Once the land was in Signet's 
possession, Boushall, physically drained from one of many operations that 
were required throughout his life, prepared to do battle with his newest 
adversaries: bank architects. The president had already determined that 
the headquarters building needed to be large and impressive enough to 
dominate the Eighth and Main corner. Local architects produced sketches 
of the traditional columned entrance and arched lobby fronting familiar 
on Richmond Main Street banks, but Boushall wasn't satisfied. The last 
thing the Morris Plan Bank of Virginia wanted was to look like every 
other bank on the block. Besides, he insisted on having a corner entrance.
<p>
	The architects were adamant, but Boushall wouldn't give in either. 
Writing off the $6,000 architect's fee, he fired them and drew the design 
himself. He then hired another set of esteemed architects, this time from 
New York, and showed them his sketch, drawn on the back of an envelope. 
When they told him his corner entrance was impractical, Boushall threatened
 to send them back to New York. Faced with the infamous Boushall will, the 
architects backed down.
<p>
	The design issue was only the beginning of the headquarters 
controversy. Arthur Morris, originator of the Morris Plan and board 
member of the Richmond bank, opposed building the branch in the midst 
of a national economic crisis. Another of the Morris Plan Bank of 
Virginia board members resigned in protest over the building. In 
October 1931, Morris ordered Boushall to halt all construction.
<p>
	However, Boushall convinced Morris to rescind his order. The 
Depression, while disastrous for business as a whole, made building the 
branch less expensive than thought possible. The branch became one 
of the first buildings in Richmond with air conditioning -- for half price.
 And because the Indiana limestone supplier went bankrupt right after 
delivering the stone for the building facade, the Morris Plan Bank of 
Virginia didn't have to pay the bill. All told, the building was a 
bargain at $360,000, especially given that the bank had paid $303,000 
for the land alone.
<p>
	June 28, 1932 marked the completion of the new building. While 
customers gathered at a reception in the lobby to admire the design -- 
and the air conditioning, the bank's Board of Directors was gathered in 
Boushall's office, dourly predicting that the expensive building was 
the beginning of the end for the Morris Plan Bank of Virginia. However, 
time and Tom Boushall were to prove them wrong. Just as the bank 
flourished for the next sixty-plus years, Boushall's unique corner 
entrance design was to become the trademark look that distinguished 
Signet branches everywhere for the next several decades.

W</font>e believe analysts must possess three critical abilities to succeed in an opportunity-rich environment such as Signet's.  Our analysts have these qualities in common, and we search for them in candidates: </center>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Analytical Thinking</b><br>
Do you process information in a structured, logical fashion?  This is not necessarily about numerical orientation.  Whether the subject matter is verbal, numeric or conceptual, an analytical thinker is able to understand complex issues and their implications then synthesize and reduce these to actionable elements.
<p>
<li><b>Creative Problem Solving</b><br>
Business situations are seldom straightforward.  Most problems involve obstacles or "road blocks" to overcome.  Creative solutions address underlying issues.  They promote and preserve the integrity of the original business objectives.  Just having new ideas is not enough - ideas need to be translated into effective approaches and applied to the problems at hand.
<p>
<li><b>Communication Skills</b><br>
In a project and team-oriented environment, the clear articulation of ideas, issues and conclusions is crucial.  From informal conversation to verbal presentation and written reports, skillful communication is how ideas are best shared.

<h2>(Information-Based Decision-Making)</h2>
</center>

<IMG align=right src="images/ibdm3.gif"><font size=+2><font size=+4>
T</font>he principal strategy that differentiates Signet and gives us a competitive advantage is our competence in IBDM. <a href="ba2.html">Business Analysts</a> apply the scientific method of establishing a hypothesis, testing it to learn more about how customers make buying decisions, and measuring how those decisions affect our costs. The diagram depicts this process.<p>
<font size=+4>
W</font>e test our hypotheses using structured data collection and then conduct careful analyses to enhance knowledge about customer demand, costs and economic and financial results. Based on these analyses, marketing programs are designed to target selected customers with specialized product offers and pricing.<p>

<font size=+4>
A</font>n important result that naturally flows from the IBDM process is the creation of new products, the addition of new customers and the potential development of new businesses. This creative dimension ensures Signet will continue to evolve and not become dependent on yesterday's products, customers or markets.

<li>Marketing Analysts discern and articulate the consumer needs of individuals and businesses, then identify and develop the products, services, delivery channels and communciations vehicles to meet those needs.
<p>
<li>Marketing analysts gather and interpret information about consumer behavior, develop offers, identify delivery channels for those offers, create and produce communications, manage and coordinate the many components and phases of a project to ensure its objectives are met.
<p>
<li>Unlike most financial services companies, Signet seldom takes just one idea to market at a time.  To ensure our understanding of consumer choices, we often test a variety of offers in a variety of ways.  Marketing analysts work with branches, the Telephone Center, Operations, Legal, and Compliance as well as suppliers, vendors, and, of course, consumers and businesses.
<p>
<li>Marketing analysts are characterized by their inquiring minds, eager interest in what's really going on in the world, and passion for converting information and hypotheses about consumer behavior into workable marketing propositions, materials and  projects.

<ul>
<li>MIS analysts deal with a broad range of business-driven information technology issues.  Their contribution to projects includes the collection and management of large quantities of data and the development of applications systems to support business operations.  MIS analysts strive to do things better, faster and in a less-costly manner.  Technology ranges from the mainframe to desktop.  Clients have varying levels of technical expertise and exist throughout all areas of Signet.
<p>
<li>MIS analysts may work in a variety of programming languages such as SAS, Business Objects, Powerbuilder, Excel, Access, Oracle, and SQL.  They are expected to learn, use and contribute to the improvement of a variety of data sources and business processes.
<p>
<li>MIS analysts may find themselves designing database alternatives, creating data transport and reporting capabilities, or developing business-driven applications.  They may assist individuals or assume responsibility for large-scale projects.  Also included under the MIS umbrella is responsibility for the integrity and availability of information used to make marketing and other business decisions.
<p>
<li>While a degree in Information Systems or Technology is not required, a breadth of systems knowledge is expected.  Signet is committed to establishing itself as a leader in the use of Information Technology.  The MIS analyst plays a key role in achieving that vision.

<ul>

<li>Performance analysts evaluate Signet's current businesses, delivery channels and expansion opportunities using internally and externally available information.  They define problems, structure approaches to developing and implementing solutions, identify issues, form hypotheses and synthesize conclusions.  Their focus is to identify, measure and optimize the drivers or leverage points of profit generation and shareholder value creation.
<p>
<li>Performance analysts use spreadsheets, databases, statistics, process flow charts, econometrics, and financial and behavioral models to evaluate product offerings, customer behavior, potential acquisitions, re-engineered processes and other business enterprises.  Measuring our performance is key to Signet's commitment to Information-Based Decision-Making.
<p>
<li>Projects for performance analysts are wide-ranging.  They may work on determining the potential impact of introducing a new product, evaluating product pricing alternatives, or estimating the cost of servicing customers.  They may also determine prospects likely to respond to a direct mail solicitation or examine the long-term potential of entering, expanding or exiting business opportunities.
<p>
<li>Performance analysts may have quantitative backgrounds, with majors in finance, engineering, or the sciences, among others.  They do not arrive with mastery of all necessary tools.  Our goal is to attract "thinkers and doers" who are capable of dealing with complex and varied problems; people who can master the tools they require on the job.

<p><b><a name="pin1">What if I lose or forget my Password?</b></a> </p>
<ul>
<li>If you lose or forget your password, contact Signet OnLine<sup><font size="1">sm</font></sup> Customer Service at 1-800-461-2945. We can either issue you a new password
or reset your last issued password if you remember it. Access to your accounts
after a password reset takes about 3-4 minutes. If a new password must be
issued it will take 7-10 days for you to receive the new one in the U.S. Mail.
It's important to protect your password. A Signet employee will never ask you for your password.

<LI>The information you receive from your Web Banking account is the closing
information from the previous business day. Signet OnLine<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">sm</FONT> </SUP> Banking Services' cut-off time for funds transfers is 10 p.m. ET. All transactions
after that time will be processed the following business day, as with any
other transaction you conduct with Signet after business hours. 
<LI>Balances in your Web Banking account may not reflect outstanding checks
or recent ATM or MasterMoney transactions. In addition, funds shown in the
online balance may be subject to a hold, notification of which is given
by a Holds on Deposit slip, and may not be available for transfers or withdrawals.

<UL>
<LI>Ledger balance is a customer's account balance as it appears on a bank statement.
The sole purpose of ledger balances, or total credits less debits during
an accounting period, is to facilitate the reconciliation of book balances. 
<LI>Available balance represents total funds available for use at that time.
The available balance is simply the current balance less funds placed on
hold or authorized through ATMs or debit card purchases. Refer to your Holds
on Deposit information provided with your deposit accounts for more information.

<UL>
<LI>Your Web Banking account will be available 24 hours a day except Sunday
mornings between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. ET due to routine maintenance performed
by Signet. Daily backups are also performed around 9 p.m. ET, but only prevent access
to the Web Banking System for 5 minutes each night. We apologize for any inconvenience this delay may cause, but it allows us to
maintain the integrity of our servers and information.

</center><p>See our <a href="security.htm">security page</a> for a detailed explanation of the many ways Signet OnLine<sup><font size="1">sm</font></sup> Banking Services keep your Web Banking transactions and communications
secure.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><a name="pin1">What if I lose or forget my Password?</b></a> </p>
<ul>
<li>If you lose or forget your password, contact Signet OnLine<sup><font size="1">sm</font></sup> Customer Service at 1-800-461-2945. We can either issue you a new password
or reset your last issued password if you remember it. Access to your accounts
after a password reset takes about 3-4 minutes. If a new password must be
issued it will take 7-10 days for you to receive the new one in the U.S. Mail.
It's important to protect your password. A Signet employee will never ask you for your password.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Your bank account information remains with Signet and is only accessible
by you when you enter your correct User ID and Password. This is why it
is important to protect this information and not share it with anyone. A Signet employee will never ask you for your password.

<li>We use encryption and firewall technologies to provide extensive protection
for our web server and your accounts. To learn more about Internet security
features and encryption use, visit our <a href="security.htm">security page</a>. 
<li>In addition, we monitor failed attempts to log onto the Web Banking system
and have security flags in place for your protection.

a transaction is allowed to access the account.</P>
<P>When you sign up for Signet OnLine<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">sm</FONT></SUP> Banking Services, we will send a letter containing your PIN number. The
first time you use Signet OnLine<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">sm</FONT></SUP> Banking Services, you will need to enter this PIN and then change it to
a new PIN of your choice. Whenever you use Signet OnLine<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">sm</FONT></SUP> Banking Services in the future, you will be prompted to enter this secret
PIN before any information is transmitted to the Intuit server for processing.
When you enter the PIN, it is sent to Intuit (our OnLine service provider)
where it must first be verified before access to your account information
is permitted. </P>
<P>Only you know your PIN; no one at Signet or Intuit knows this number. </P>

 </P>
</CENTER><P><B><A NAME="Encryption">ENCRYPTION</B></A> </P>
<P>Encryption protects the privacy of an electronic transmission. It works
by scrambling the electronic transmission into a format which is unreadable.
The electronic transmission can only be unscrambled if it is received by
the person or destination for whom it was intended. If an encrypted message
was captured while it was being transferred, it can not be understood without
decryption. </P>
<P>State of the art RSA Public-Key encryption technology is used for all of
Signet's OnLine Banking and OnLine Payment Services. In addition to its
encryption capabilities, RSA also confirms that the electronic transmission
was not altered while in transit, and validates the identity of the sender
by using digital signature technology. RSA is the industry standard for
secured electronic transmissions. </P>

 </P>
</CENTER><P><B><A NAME="PRIVATE vs. PUBLIC NETWORKS">A PRIVATE NETWORK</B></A> </P>
<P>All of Signet OnLine<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">sm</FONT></SUP> Banking Services use a private network to send electronic transmissions.
Because this is a private network, the only way to intercept an electronic
transmission is to tap into the phone line or private network. Even if this
unlikely task were accomplished, the information captured would still be
in an unreadable encrypted format. While we are confident in the security
of our system, a system cannot be guaranteed as tamper-proof. Caution is
urged anytime you send messages or instructions online to Signet or any
other party. </P>

 </P>
</CENTER><P><B><A NAME="Firewalls">FIREWALLS</B></A> </P>
<P>A firewall is a group of computers which manage and control access to a
network. With Signet OnLine<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">sm</FONT></SUP> Banking Service all electronic transmissions (such as OnLine Payment requests) must be authorized
before the Intuit server accepts the transmission. Any attempt to access
the server without the specifically authorized encryption type and PIN will
be disconnected immediately by the firewall. In addition, at no time do
users have live access to Signet's original customer files -- only copies
of customer information are provided to protect the integrity of Signet's
files and the customer's account activity. </P>

<P>
<p><b>Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM, also called Variable Rate Mortgage):</b>
A mortgage with an interest rate that adjusts periodically to reflect changes
in market conditions. Your mortgage payments are adjusted up or down (usually
on an annual basis) as the interest rate changes. To protect you in a rising
interest market, rate increases are limited (usually 2 percentage points
annually; 6 percentage points over the life of the loan).</p>

<p> <b>Annual Membership/Participation Fee:</b> An amount that is charged
annually for having the line of credit available. It is charged regardless
of whether or not you use the line.</p>

<p> <b>Annual Percentage Rate (APR):</b> The cost of credit on a yearly
basis expressed as a percentage. (In the case of a mortgage this rate also
includes points and other associated costs, therefore it is usually higher
than the advertised simple interest rate. The APR more accurately reflects
what you'll be paying and allows you to compare different mortgages based
on actual costs.)</p>

<p> <b>Application Fee:</b> Fees that are paid upon application for your
loan or credit line. It may include charges for property appraisal and
a credit report.</p>

<p> <b>Appraisal:</b> An estimate of the value of a home, made by a professional
appraiser. The maximum amount of the mortgage is usually based on the appraisal.</p>

<p> <b>Balloon Payment:</b> A lump-sum payment that you may be required
to make under a plan when the plan ends.</p>

<p> <b>Cap:</b> A limit on how much the variable-interest rate can increase
during the life of the plan.</p>

<p> <b>Closing Costs:</b> Fees paid at closing, including attorney's fees,
fees for preparing and filing a mortage, for taxes, title search, and insurance.
While closing costs depend on your state and county, as a rule of thumb,
closing costs usually add up to 3 to 6 percent of the mortgage amount.</p>

<p> <b>Credit Limit:</b> The maximum amount that you can borrow under the
home equity plan.</p>

<p> <b>Equity:</b> The difference between the fair market value (appraised
value) of your home and your outstanding mortgage balance. If you make
a 5 percent down payment, you have 5 percent of the price of your home
in equity. As you make payments toward the principal over time, the equity
in your home grows.</p>

<p> <b>Escrow:</b> A special third-party account set up by the lender in
which a portion of your monthly payment funds are held to pay for taxes,
insurance and other items. &quot;Escrow&quot; can also refer to a third
party who carries out the instructions of both the buyer and seller to
handle the paperwork at the settlement.</p>

<p> <b>Fixed Rate Mortgage:</b> A mortgage with an interest rate that stays
the same (fixed) over the life of the mortgage. Monthly payments for a
fixed rate mortgage are very stable.</p>

<p> <b>Good Faith Estimate:</b> A document provided at application that
provides estimates of all costs associated with obtaining and closing a
mortgage loan.</p>

<p> <b>Index:</b> The base for rate changes that the lender uses to decide
how much the annual percentage rate will change over time.</p>

<p> <b>Interest Rate:</b> The periodic charge, expressed as a percentage
rate to be charged.</p>

<p> <b>Loan-to-Value Ratio:</b> The relationship between the appraised
value of property at closing and the loan amount.</p>

<p> <b>Margin:</b> The number of percentage points the lender adds to the
index rate to determine the annual percentage rate to be charged.</p>

<p> <b>Minimum Payment:</b> The minimum amount that you must pay (usually
monthly) on your account. In some plans, the minimum payment may be &quot;interest
only.&quot; In other plans, the minimum payment may include principal and
interest.</p>

<p> <b>Origination Fee:</b> The fee charged by a lender to prepare all
the documents associated with your mortgage.</p>

<p> <b>Payment Frequency:</b> How often you make a payment on your loan,
thus decreasing your principal and interest due. Typically either bi-weekly,
monthly, quarterly, or annually.</p>

<p> <b>PITI (Principal-Interest-Taxes-Insurances):</b> Abbreviation for
the parts of a typical monthly mortgage payment.</p>

<p> <b>Points:</b> A point is equal to one percent of the amount of your
credit line. Points usually are collected at closing, and are in addition
to monthly interest.</p>

<p> <b>Prepaids:</b> The expenses that are put into escrow at closing,
usually including real estate taxes, insurance, and interest.</p>

<p> <b>Principal:</b> The amount of money that you still owe. This will
decrease with every payment. This is also the amount of money that your
interest is calculated from.</p>

<p> <b>Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI):</b> An insurance policy the borrower
buys to protect the lender from non-payment of the loan. PMI policies are
usually required if you make a down payment that is below 20% of the sales
price of the home.</p>

<p> <b>Security Interest:</b> An interest that a lender takes in the borrower's
property to assure repayment of a debt.</p>

<p> <b>Title Insurance:</b> An insurance policy which insures you and/or
the lender against errors in the title search.</p>

<p> <b>Transaction Fee:</b> A fee charged each time you draw on your credit
line.</p>

<p> <b>Variable Rate:</b> An interest rate that changes periodically in
relation to an index. Payments may increase or decrease accordingly.</p>

<HR>

<P>

If  you own a home, consider a Signet Home Equity Line to fund your educational

borrowing  needs. Our rates are lower than most other loans, plus your

<B>interest may be 100% tax deductible.</B>  Ask your tax advisor.  Home equity

borrowing is one of the smartest, most cost effective way to pay for tuition,

room and board, a new or used car, even text-books and supplies.  Take a look!

</P>

<P>

You get more than just a terrific interest rate with a  Signet Home Equity Line,

<B>you get CONVENIENCE:</B>

</P>

<P>



<B>Your home equity line is just like a credit card -- only better.</B>  You

can use your line of credit over and over again for anything you need. And since

your equity line interest may be tax deductible and credit lines are

substantially higher than credit cards, it's the ideal way to pay annual tuition

, monthly rent or just to have for your peace of mind, should any unexpected

emergencies arise.

</P>

<P>

And as you pay down your balance, the money is available again for other things.

You can put one or more students through college and than tap your equity line

again when they decide they are off to grad school -- or if you decide to go

back to school yourself!

</P>

<P>

<B>Signet Equity Line Checks look just like personal checks, for your freedom

and privacy.</B>   Use them anywhere checks are accepted.  There are no per

check charges and you can order additional checks whenever you wish<I> free of

charge.</I>

</P>

<P>

<B>You choose a repayment plan that fits your budget.</B>  You can pay off your

entire balance each month, the modest, minimum payment or anything in between.

We even offer an interest only payment option to make your monthly obligation

more affordable.

</P>

<P>

<B>Signet can loan up to 100% of your available equity</B>.  Even if you have

very little equity in your property, we may still be able to offer you the many

benefits of a Signet Home Equity Line.

</P>

<P>

Don' t let the high costs of higher education get you down.  Call

<B><FONT SIZE="+1">1-800-693-6693</FONT></B> today for more information about

a Signet Home Equity Line of Credit.</P>

</CENTER><P><BR>
 </P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P><BR>
 <A NAME="question1">1. Do I have what it takes to own/manage a small business?</A></P>
<P>You will be your own most important employee, so an objective appraisal
of your strengths and weaknesses is essential. Some questions to ask yourself
are: Am I a self starter? How well do I get along with a variety of Personalities?
How good am I at making decisions? Do I have the physical and emotional
stamina to run a business? How well do I plan and organize? Are my attitudes
and drive strong enough to maintain motivation? How will the business affect
my family?</P>
<P><A NAME="question2">2. What business should I choose?</A></P>
<P>Usually, the best business for you is the one in which you are most skilled
and interested. As you review your options, you may wish to consult local
experts and businesspersons about the growth potential of various businesses
in your area. Matching your background with the local market will increase
your chance of success. </P>
<P><A NAME="question3">3. What is a business plan and why do I need one?</A></P>
<P>A business plan precisely defines your business, identifies your goals and
serves as your firm's resume. Its basic components include a current and
performance balance sheet, an income statement and a cash flow analysis.
It helps you allocate resources properly, handle unforeseen complications,
and make the right decisions. Because it provides specific and organized
information about your company and how you will repay borrowed money, a
good business plan is a crucial part of any loan package. Additionally,
it can tell your sales personnel, suppliers and others about your operations
and goals.</P>
<P><A NAME="question4">4. Why do I need to define my business in detail?</A></P>
<P>It may seem silly to ask yourself, &quot;What business am I really in,&quot; but some
owner-managers have gone broke because they never answered that question.
One watch store owner realized that most of his time was spent repairing
watches while most of his money was spent selling them. He finally decided
he was in the repair business and discontinued the sales operations. His
profits improved dramatically.</P>
<P><A NAME="question5">5. What legal aspects do I need to consider?</A></P>
<P>Licenses required, zoning laws and other regulations vary from business
to business and from state to state. Your local Small Business Administration
(SBA) office and/or chamber of commerce will provide you with general information,
but you will need to consult your attorney for advice specific to your enterprise
and area. You also must decide about your form of organization (corporation,
partnership or sole proprietorship) or tax status (e.g., should you opt
for a Subchapter S status?).</P>
<P><A NAME="question6">6. What do I need to succeed in a business?</A></P>
<P>There are four basics of success in small business:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sound management practices. 
<LI>Industry experience. 
<LI>Technical support. 
<LI>Planning ability. 
</UL>
<P>Few people start a business with all of these bases covered. Honestly assess
your own experience and skills; then look for partners or key employees
to compensate for your deficiencies.</P>
<P><A NAME="question7">7. Would a partner(s) make it easier to be successful?</A></P>
<P>A business partner does not guarantee success. If you require additional
management skills or start-up capital, engaging a partner may be your best
decision. Personality and character, as well as ability to give technical
or financial assistance, determine the ultimate success of a partnership. </P>
<P><A NAME="question8">8. How can I find qualified employees?</A></P>
<P>Choose your employees carefully. Decide beforehand what you want them to
do. Be specific. You may need flexible employees who can shift from task
to task as required. Interview and screen applicants with care. Remember,
good questions lead to good answers-the more you learn about each applicant's
experience and skills, the better prepared you are to make your decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="question9">9. How do I set wage levels?</A></P>
<P>Wage levels are calculated using position importance and skill required
as criteria. Consult your trade association and accountant to learn the
most current practices, cost ratios and profit margins in your business
field. While there is a minimum wage set by federal law for most jobs, the
actual wage paid is entirely between you and your prospective employee.</P>
<P><A NAME="question10">10. What other financial responsibilities do I have for employees?</A></P>
<P>You must withhold federal and state income taxes, contribute to unemployment
and workers compensation systems, and match Social Security contributions.
You may also wish to inquire about key employee life or disability insurance.
Because laws on these matters vary from state to state, you probably should
consult local information sources and/or SBA offices.</P>
<P><A NAME="question11">11. What kind of security measures must I take?</A></P>
<P>Crimes ranging from armed robbery to embezzlement can destroy even the best
businesses. You should install a good physical security system. Just as
important, you must establish policies and safeguards to ensure awareness
and honesty among your personnel. Because computer systems can be used to
defraud as well as keep records, you should check into a computer security
program. Consider taking seminars on how to spot and deter shoplifting and
how to handle cash and merchandise; it is time and money well spent. Finally,
careful screening when hiring can be your best ally against crime.</P>
<P><A NAME="question12">12. Should I hire family members to work for me?</A> </P>
<P>Frequently, family members of the owner &quot;help out in the business.&quot; For
some small business owners it is a rewarding experience; for others it can
cause irreparable damage. Carefully consider their loyalty and respect for
you as the owner-manager. Can you keep your family and business decisions
separate?</P>
<P><A NAME="question13">13. Do I need a computer?</A></P>
<P>Small business today faces growing inventory requirements, increased customer
expectations, rising costs and intense competition. Computers can provide
information that leads to better returns on investment. At the same time,
they help you cope with the many other pressures of your business. Computers
are not cure-alls, however, and considerable care should be given to:</P>
<P>(1) deciding if you need one, and<BR>
 (2) selecting the best system (or personal computer) foryour business.</P>
<P><A NAME="question14">14. What about telecommunications?</A></P>
<P>All small businesses share some common functions: sales, purchasing, financing,
operations and administration. Depending on your individual business, telecommunications
can support your objectives in any or all of these areas. In its basic form,
the telephone (the terminal) and the network (local or long distance) make
up the basic components of telecommunications. It is an effective tool that
can easily change with seasonality and growth. How you use telecommunications
can affect how efficiently and profitably your company grows in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="question15">15. How much money do I need to get started?</A></P>
<P>Once you have taken care of your building and equipment needs you also must
have enough money on hand to cover operating expenses for at least a year.
These expenses include your salary as the owner and money to repay your
loans. One of the leading causes of business failure is insufficient start-up
capital. Consequently, you should work closely with your accountant to estimate
your cash flow needs.</P>
<P><A NAME="question16">16. What are the alternatives in financing a business?</A></P>
<P>Committing your own funds is often the first financing step. It is certainly
the best indicator of how serious you are about your business. Risking your
own money gives confidence for others to invest in your business. You may
want to consider family members or a partner for additional financing. Banks
are an obvious source of funds. Other loan sources include commercial finance
companies, venture capital firms, local development companies and life insurance
companies. Trade credit, selling stock and equipment leasing offer alternatives
to borrowing. Leasing, for example, can be an advantage because it does
not tie up your cash.</P>
<P><A NAME="question17">17. What do I have to do to get a loan?</A></P>
<P>Initially, the lender will ask three questions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>How will you use the loan? 
<LI>How much do you need to borrow? 
<LI>How will you repay the loan? 
</UL>
<P>When you apply for the loan, you must provide projected financial statements
and a cohesive, clear business plan which supplies the name of the firm,
location, production facilities, legal structure and business goals. A clear
description of your experience and management capabilities, as well as the
expertise of other key personnel, will also be needed.</P>
<P><A NAME="question18">18. What kind of profits can I expect?</A></P>
<P>Not an easy question. However, there are standards of comparison called
&quot;industry ratios&quot; which can help you estimate your profits. Return on Investment
(ROl), for example, estimates the amount of profit gained on a given number
of dollars invested in the business. These ratios are broken down by Standard
Industrial Classification (SlC) code and size, so you can look up your type
of business to see what the industry averages are. These figures are published
by several groups, and can be found at your library. Help is also available
through the SBA and the trade associations that serve your industry.</P>
<P><A NAME="question19">19. What should I know about accounting and bookkeeping?</A></P>
<P>The importance of keeping adequate records cannot be stressed too much.
Without records, you cannot see how well your business is doing and where
it is going. At a minimum, records are needed to substantiate:</P>
<P>1. Your tax returns under Federal and State laws,including income tax and
Social Security laws;<BR>
 2. Your request for credit from vendors or a loan from a bank;<BR>
 3. Your claims about the business, should you wish to sell it.</P>
<P>But most important, you need them to run your business successfully and
to increase your profits.</P>
<P><A NAME="question20">20. How do I set up the right record keeping system for my business?</A></P>
<P>The kind of records and how many you need depend on your particular operation.
The SBA's resources and an accountant can provide you with many options.
When deciding what is and is not necessary, keep in mind the following questions:</P>
<P>1. How will this record be used?<BR>
 2. How important is this information likely to be?<BR>
 3. Is the information available elsewhere in an equally accessible form?</P>
<P><A NAME="question21">21. What financial statements will I need?</A></P>
<P>You should prepare and understand two basic financial statements:</P>
<P>(1) the balance sheet, which is a record of assets, liabilities and capital;
and<BR>
 (2) the income (profit and loss) statement, a summary of your earnings
and expenses over a given period of time.</P>
<P><A NAME="question22">22. What does marketing involve?</A></P>
<P>Marketing is your most important organizing tool. There are four basic aspects
of marketing, often called the &quot;four P's&quot;:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Product: The item or service you sell. 
<LI>Price: The amount you charge for your product or service. 
<LI>Promote: The ways you inform your market as to who, what and where you are. 
<LI>Provide: The channels you use to take the product to thecustomer. 
</UL>
<P>As you can see, marketing encompasses much more than just advertising or
selling. For example, a major part of marketing involves researching your
customers: What do they want? What can they afford? What do they think?
Your understanding and application of the answers to such questions play
a major role in the success or failure of your business.</P>
<P><A NAME="question23">23. What is my market potential?</A></P>
<P>The principles of determining market share and market potential are the
same for all geographic areas. First determine a customer profile (who)
and the geographic size of the market (how many). This is the general market
potential. Knowing the number and strength of your competitors (and then
estimating the share of business you will take from them) will give you
the market potential specific to your enterprise.</P>
<P><A NAME="question24">24. What about advertising?</A></P>
<P>Your business growth will be influenced by how well you plan and execute
an advertising program. Because it is one of the main creators of your business'
image, it must be well planned and well budgeted. Contact local advertising
agencies or a local SBA office to assist you in devising an effective advertising
strategy.</P>
<P><A NAME="question25">25. How do I set price levels?</A></P>
<P>The price of a service or item is based on three basic production costs:
Direct materials, Labor and Overhead. After these costs are determined,
a price is then selected that will be both profitable and competitive. Because
pricing can be a complicated process, you may wish to seek help from an
expert.</P>
<P><A NAME="question26">26. Are some locations better than others?</A></P>
<P>Time and effort devoted to selecting where to locate your business can mean
the difference between success and failure. The kind of business you are
in, the potential market, availability of employees and the number of competitive
establishments all determine where you should put your business.</P>
<P><A NAME="question27">27. Is it better to lease or buy the store (plant) and equipment?</A></P>
<P>This is a good question and needs to be considered carefully. Leasing does
not tie up your cash; a disadvantage is that the item then has no resale
or salvage value since you do not own it. Careful weighing of alternatives
and a cost analysis will help you make the best decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="question28">28. Can I operate a business from my home?</A></P>
<P>Yes. In fact, experts estimate that as many as 20 percent of new small business
enterprises are operated out of the owner's home. Local SBA offices and
state chambers of commerce can provide pertinent information on how to manage
a home-based business.</P>
<P><A NAME="question29">29. How do I find out about suppliers/manufacturers/ distributors?</A></P>
<P>Most suppliers want new accounts. A prime source for finding suppliers is
the Thomas Register, which lists manufacturers by categories and geographic
area. Most libraries have a directory of manufacturers listed by state.
If you know the product line manufacturers, a letter or phone call to the
companies will get you the local distributor-wholesaler. In some lines,
trade shows are good sources of getting suppliers and looking over competing
products.</P>
<P><A NAME="question30">30. Where can I go for help?</A></P>
<P>The U.S. Small Business Administration has offices in nearly every major
city in the country. SBA's Office of Business Initiatives operates the toll-free
&quot;Answer Desk&quot; at 1-800-8-ASK-SBA, to give callers direct referral to appropriate
sources of information. Sponsored by SBA are a variety of counselling, training
and information services including the Service Corps of Retired Executives
(SCORE), Business Information Centers (BICs) and Small Business Development
Centers (SBDC). In addition, procurement center representatives can be found
at each major military installation. More than 2,700 chambers of commerce
are located throughout the country to provide additional assistance.</P>
<P><A NAME="question31">31. What do I do when I'm ready?</A></P>
<P>You have done your homework: you have a complete business plan; you know
where you want to operate; you know how much cash you will need; and you
have specific information on employee, vendor and market possibilities.
You now may want someone to look over your plans objectively. Contact the
business department at a local college for another opinion. A SCORE representative
at the Small Business Administration can also review your work and help
with the fine tuning. Then, when you have made the final decision to go
ahead, it is time to call the bank and get going. Good luck!</P>
<P>All of SBA's programs and services are extended to the public on a nondiscriminatory
basis.</P>

<font size=+1>
RICHMOND, Va. - (Oct. 17, 1996) - Signet Banking Corporation today reported earnings of $29.6 million, or $.49 per share, for the third quarter of 1996.  Earnings were down modestly from both the previous quarter and the 1995 third quarter as a result of increased loan loss provisions for consumer loan growth, and a one-time charge for the recapitalization of the Savings Association Insurance Fund.  The company reported earnings of $30.5 million, or $.50 per share, and $30.1 million, or $.50 per share, respectively, for the second quarter of 1996 and the third quarter of 1995.
<p>

	Discussing the results, President and Chief Executive Officer Malcolm S. McDonald said that he was especially pleased with the nature of the loan growth during the quarter.  "Asset quality remains very strong and our disciplined marketing is rewarding us with healthy growth in both the consumer and commercial arenas.  Our confidence in an information-based strategy continues to grow.  Additionally, we are now embarking on a project to create an entirely new infrastructure to support our strategy more efficiently."
<p>

	Managed loans (balance sheet and securitized assets) grew 3 percent from the previous quarter to $7.2 billion.  Direct marketing of installment and home equity loans, coupled with seasonal growth in educational lending, fueled a 6 percent increase in the managed consumer portfolio during the quarter.  Specialized lending and Signets leasing business contributed to 4 percent growth in the commercial loan portfolio.  In keeping with Signets de-emphasis of commercial real estate lending, the company sold $43 million of performing loans in July.  Commercial real estate loans declined 11 percent  to $526 million.
<p>

	Non-performing assets at September 30, 1996 totaled $43.9 million or .71 percent of loans and foreclosed properties, down 15 percent from $51.5 million a year earlier, and down 20 percent from $54.9 million at June 30, 1996.  Net charge-offs for the quarter were $17.0 million, or 1.15 percent of average loans.  Charge-offs included $3.7 million related to one commercial construction loan.  At quarter end, the allowance for loan losses totaled $128.5 million and was equal to 441 percent of non-performing loans and 2.08 percent of loans outstanding.
<p>

	Total revenues (net interest income and non-interest income) for the quarter were $186.6 million, up 3 percent from $181.2 million in the second quarter.  Despite higher interest expense, net interest income increased modestly during the third quarter. Signets net interest margin was 4.70 percent, down 5 basis points from the previous quarter.  The net interest margin is projected to improve somewhat as consumer loans become a greater proportion of the earning asset mix.  Non-interest income benefited from strong trading profits and revenues earned by Signets specialty commercial groups.
<p>

	Non-interest expense for the third quarter was $122.9 million compared with $121.5 million in the second quarter of 1996.  Public relations, sales and advertising expense rose $1.7 million in the third quarter as higher solicitation expense generated loan growth.  Non-interest expense also included a one-time charge of $1.6 million for the Savings Association Insurance Fund recapitalization and a charge of $.6 million taken in conjunction with the sale of commercial real estate loans.  The efficiency ratio was 65 percent.
<p>

	The third quarter return on equity was 13.6 percent and the return on average assets was 1.03 percent. The equity-to-assets ratio increased to 7.74 percent.
<p>
	Signet <a href="http://www.signet.com">(http://www.signet.com)</a> is an $11 billion financial institution with headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. The company offers a wide array of financial services through its Capital Markets, <a href="http://www.signet.com/comm">Commercial</a> and <a href="http://www.si

<p>
<font size =+5>O</font><font size=+1>n February 28, 1995, Signet completed the spin-off of substantially all of its credit card business. For a more detailed discussion of this transaction, please refer to <a href="md_a.htm">Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- 1995 Compared To 1994. </a>
<p>
In addition to the discussion of consolidated information, pro forma data is provided where it was meaningful to discuss the Company's results excluding Capital One.  <p>
<H2><STRONG>Income Statement Analysis</STRONG></H2><BR>
Signet reported consolidated net income of $149.8 million, or $2.59 per share, for 1994 compared with $174.4 million, or $3.06 per share, in 1993. The 1994 net income reflected special pre-tax charges of $92.2 million for restructuring and for terminating certain data processing contracts. Included in the restructuring charges were costs related to an early retirement plan, employee severance and consolidation of facilities.
<p>
 On a pro forma basis, net income was $55.8 million in 1994, a decrease of $8.1 million, or 12.6%, from $63.9 million in 1993. The 1994 pro forma net income reflected special pre-tax charges of $43.2 million for restructuring. On a pro forma basis and excluding special one-time charges, 1994 net income amounted to $83.9 million resulting in an ROA of 0.95% and an ROE of 10.26%. These ratios compared favorably with the 0.69% ROA and 9.10% ROE achieved in 1993, on a pro forma basis. 
<p>
Taxable equivalent net interest income of $523.7 million was a principal component of earnings and reflected a decline of $21.4 million, or 3.9%, from the 1993 level. The net yield margin for 1994 was 5.16%, a one basis point decline from the prior year. This decrease in the net yield margin was primarily due to higher funding costs associated with interim funding for Capital One. On a pro forma basis, taxable equivalent net interest income increased slightly to $345.0 million. The pro forma net yield margin increased 35 basis points to 4.59% from 4.24% in the previous year. 
<p>
On a pro forma basis, the net interest spread was 3.96%, a 6% increase from the 1993 level of 3.75%. The overall yield on earning assets was 7.21%, up 50 basis points from 1993, while the increase in rates paid for interest bearing liabilities amounted to 3.25%, up 29 basis points from the previous year.  Pro forma non-interest operating income totaled $195.2 million for 1994, relatively level with the prior year.  Most of the change from the previous year resulted from increases in service charges on deposit accounts ($1.7 million) and trust income ($1.8 million) that were offset by a decline in credit card servicing and service charge income ($3.8 million). Pro forma non-interest expense totaled $488.3 million for 1994, an increase of $44.3 million, or 10%. The increase from the previous year is due to the restructuring charge of $43.2 million which included costs related to an early retirement plan, employee severance and consolidation of facilities. Staff expense (salaries and employee benefits), the largest component of non-interest expense, totaled $236.3 million, a $7.1 million, or 3%, increase over 1993. Salaries rose $12.5 million or 7% year-over-year and benefits expense for 1994 decreased $5.5 million, or 10%, because the $6 million cost of implementing SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," was recorded in 1993. Travel and communications expense rose $5.0 million, or 28%, year-over-year, primarily due to higher postage and telephone charges related to managing a larger consumer loan portfolio.
<p>
 The $14.3 million decline in foreclosed property expense was primarily due to the elimination in 1994 of provisions recorded to maintain the reserve for foreclosed properties and lower costs to maintain and operate these properties. During 1993, foreclosed property reserve provisions of $7.4 million were recorded. The reserve was eliminated at year-end 1994 as management deemed foreclosed property to be fairly valued on the balance sheet. The deposit insurance assessment from the FDIC totaled $16.8 million, a $1.5 million decline from 1993.
<p>
Signet's pro forma efficiency ratio (the ratio of non-interest expense to taxable equivalent operating income) was 88.2% for 1994, compared with 81.2% for 1993. Excluding the restructuring charges and foreclosed property expense from non-interest expense lowered the ratio to 80.3% and 78.7% for the same respective years. With the anticipated Capital One spin-off, Signet began a major refocus on its core banking businesses.
<p>
 In the third quarter of 1994, Signet's Board of Directors approved a comprehensive core bank improvement plan aimed at reducing Signet's efficiency ratio through cost reductions and revenue initiatives in order to enhance its competitive position. In conjunction with the plan, Signet recorded a restructuring charge of $43.2 million ($28.1 million after-tax, or $0.48 per share). Included in the charge was approximately $15.6 million primarily for increased retiree medical and pension benefits related to an early retirement program in which 225 employees participated, approximately $13.0 million of accelerated retiree medical and pension obligations and anticipated severance benefits for approximately 750 employees and approximately $14.6 million related to the writedown of bank-owned properties and lease termination costs due to the expected abandonment of facilities resulting from the reduction in employees. As of December 31, 1994, Signet had reduced the restructuring liability by approximately $2.4 million for severance and early retirement benefits and approximately $5.9 million for lease termination and other facilities related costs. As a result of implementing the cost reduction measures, the number of full-time equivalent employees excluding Capital One fell 13% during the year ended December 31, 1994. 
<p>
The provision for loan losses of $14.5 million represented a significant decrease from the 1993 level of $47.3 million as credit quality continued to improve. On a pro forma basis, Signet had net provision reversals of $16.2 million in 1994 due to improved credit quality in the commercial portfolio and improved confidence in the real estate portfolio from successful completion of the Accelerated Real Estate Assets Reduction Program compared with provision expense of $13.3 million in 1993. 
<p>
Net charge-offs decreased 25% to $24.9 million for 1994, compared with $33.0 million for the prior year. Decreases were noted in all loan categories except real estate-mortgage. Of the $30.1 million in real estate charge-offs, approximately $21 million were the result of the sale of $102 million of real estate related loans in the third quarter of 1994. Commercial loan net charge-offs experienced an improvement when comparing 1994 with 1993 due to improved credit quality. Consumer net charge-offs increased to $1.6 million from $0.5 in 1993 partially the result of charge-offs on the loan-by-check product. The allowance for loan losses on a pro forma basis at December 31, 1994 was $152.0 million, or 2.67% of year-end loans, compared with the 1993 year-end allowance of $189.8 million, or 4.27% of loans.
<p>
Pro forma income tax expense for 1994 was $15.8 million as compared with $14.4 million for 1993. This represented an effective tax rate of 22.0% for 1994 and 18.4% for 1993. An increase in the federal tax rate from 34% to 35% in 1993 had minimal impact on the income tax expense. Adoption of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" in 1993 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
<p>
<H2><STRONG><A NAME="blshtrev">Balance Sheet Review</A></STRONG></H2>
<p>
Pro forma average earning assets totaled $7.8 billion for 1994, down $537 million from 1993. The portfolios experiencing the largest declines were investment securities ($1.6 billion) and trading account securities ($203 million), while the securities available for sale and the loan portfolios increased by $1.0 billion and $167 million, respectively. Loans (net of unearned income) for 1994, averaged $4.6 billion, a 4% increase from the 1993 level. Pro forma consumer loans averaged $1.5 billion for 1994, a 30% increase from 1993, and represented 33% of the total loan portfolio. The increase in pro forma consumer loans was concentrated in student loans and loans generated by implementing Signet's information-based strategy. Real estate-construction loans totaled $249 million, a decrease of 44%, or $200 million, from the 1993 average. During 1994, the Company sold a $102 million portfolio of real estate related loans at a discount for which there was sufficient allowance. The real estate loan sale impacted the real estate-construction ($73 million) and real estate-commercial mortgage loan ($29 million) categories. 
<p>
At December 31, 1994, trading account securities consisted of $212 million of government securities, $139 million of asset-backed securities and $2 million of other securities. Trading account securities averaged $287 million in 1994, down 41% from the $484 million level in 1993. Securities available for sale for 1994 averaged $1.3 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion over the 1993 level, when SFAS No. 115 was adopted. At December 31, 1994, the securities available for sale portfolio (excluding securities having no maturity) had a remaining average maturity of less than four years and unrealized gains of $1.6 million and unrealized losses of $39.2 million. Signet's investment securities portfolio totaled $399 million at December 31, 1994. Investment securities for 1994 averaged $264 million, a decrease of $1.6 billion over the 1993 level, as approximately $1.5 billion were reclassified from investment securities to securities available for sale when SFAS No. 115 was adopted. At year-end 1994, the investment securities portfolio had a remaining average maturity of less than four years and unrealized gains of $5.9 million and unrealized losses of $5.0 million. Investment securities portfolio yields increased to 10.71% from the 1993 level of 6.63% as the majority of securities reclassified to available for sale were lower yielding securities.
<p>
<h2><strong> <A NAME="risk">Risk Elements</A></strong></h2>
<p>
Non-performing assets at year-end 1994 totaled $48.5 million. This compared favorably with $116.5 million (net of the $5.7 million foreclosed property reserve) at the end of 1993. Non-performing real estate assets declined $34.1 million, or 48%, including a $20.1 million drop in foreclosed properties (net of reserves). One large commercial credit ($24.7 million) was placed on non-accrual status at the end of 1993. In early 1994, the Company sold this loan, for which there was sufficient allowance. Signet sold $27.5 million of foreclosed properties during 1994.  Signet provided financing on only $388 thousand of the foreclosed properties sold in 1994. The reserve for foreclosed properties was eliminated at December 31, 1994, since management deemed foreclosed properties to be fairly valued on the balance sheet.
<p>
Pro forma accruing loans past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments totaled $40.6 million at the end of 1994 and 1993. Of the 1994 past due student loans, $20.3 million, or 90%, were indirectly government guaranteed and do not represent material loss exposure to Signet. At year-end 1994, management was monitoring $43.2 million of loans for which the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms was uncertain. These loans were not included in the above disclosure.
<p>
By the end of 1993, Signet had successfully completed its Accelerated Real Estate Asset Reduction Program. As a result of the success, Signet terminated the Program effective January 1, 1994, and all remaining assets were assigned to work-out units.
<p>
<h2><strong><A NAME="fundcap">Funding and Capital</A></strong></h2>
<p>
Pro forma average deposits totaled $7.4 billion for 1994, a 4% decrease from 1993. Short-term borrowings declined $235 million, or 62%, from 1993 to average $142 million. Long-term borrowings averaged $255 million for 1994, a decline of 11%, or $32 million, from 1993. This decline resulted primarily from regularly scheduled amortization of principal and on February 1, 1994, Signet called for redemption at par the remaining $11.9 million of 7 3/4% Senior Debentures due in 1997. During the third quarter of 1994, Signet completed the acquisition of Pioneer, a $400 million financial institution located in Chester, Virginia. The transaction was structured as a tax-free exchange of stock and was accounted for as a purchase. Pioneer's shareholders received .6232 shares of Signet common stock for each Pioneer share held. This resulted in Signet issuing approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock. The transaction had little dilutive effect on Signet's earnings per share.
<p>
 Effective January 1, 1994, Signet adopted SFAS No. 115, which requires that securities classified as available for sale be reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of retained earnings, net of tax. At December 31, 1994, the net unrealized losses, net of tax, related to securities available for sale, totaled $21.8 million primarily from a reduction in the value of mortgage backed securities and U.S. Treasury obligations. The risk-based capital ratios for the Company at December 31, 1994 were 15.59% and 12.58% for Total Capital and Tier I Capital, respectively. The leverage ratio at December 31, 1994 was 9.90%.

The initial amount of borrowing under the Bridge Financing Facility was approximately $1.7 billion at 60 basis points over LIBOR before financing costs. In December 1994, Capital One reduced the Bridge Financing Facility by $400 million through new funding sources, primarily large denomination certificates. In early 1995, the Bridge Financing Facility was further reduced by bank notes with longer maturities. In conjunction with the spin-off on February 28, 1995, the Bridge Financing Facility was transferred to Capital One and was no longer a source of funding for Signet.

<h1 align=left>Notes to Management's Discussion and Financial Statements
</h1>
<p>
<h2><strong><em>Note A -- Significant Accounting Policies</em></strong></h2>
<p>
<font size =+5>S</font><font size=+1>ignet Banking Corporation ("Signet" or "the Company") engages in general commercial and consumer banking and provides a full range of financial services to individuals, businesses and organizations. Signet offers investment services including municipal bond, government, federal agency and money market sales and trading, foreign exchange trading, mutual funds and discount brokerage. In addition, specialized services for trust, leasing, asset-based lending, cash management, real estate, insurance, consumer financing and an international operation concentrating on trade finance are offered. Signet's primary market area extends from Baltimore to Washington, south to Richmond, and on to Hampton Roads/Tidewater, Virginia. The Company markets several of its products nationally.
<p>
The consolidated financial statements of Signet and subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles and prevailing practices of the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of the significant accounting and reporting policies used in preparing the financial statements. 
<p>
<EM><STRONG>Consolidation and Reclassifications:</STRONG></EM> <BR>
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Signet, including Signet Bank (formerly Signet Bank/Virginia and Signet Bank/Maryland) and Signet Bank N.A., its principal banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation is included in the financial statements through February 28, 1995, at which time the spin-off to shareholders was completed. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 1995 presentation.
<p>
<strong><EM>Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows:</EM></strong><BR>
Cash and cash equivalents, as presented in the statement of cash flows, includes cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with other banks, and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements.
<p>
<strong><EM>Trading Instruments:</EM></strong><BR>
Financial instruments (including trading account securities and derivatives) used for trading purposes are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value at the reporting date. Realized and unrealized changes in fair values are recognized in other non-interest income (trading profits (losses)) in the period in which the changes occur. Trading instruments included in the consolidated balance sheet are comprised primarily of government securities and asset-backed securities. Interest revenue arising from these trading instruments is included in the statement of consolidated operations as part of total interest income. In 1995, the net gain on all trading activities recorded in trading profits was $11,969; in 1994, the net loss was $268. The increase (decrease) in net unrealized income on all trading activities during 1995 and 1994 was $1,875 and ($4,998), respectively. 
<p>
<strong><EM>Securities Available For Sale:</EM> </strong><BR>
Securities available for sale represent those securities not classified as either investment securities or trading account securities. Securities available for sale includes securities for which the primary objective is to realize a holding gain, and/or securities held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held until maturity. Securities held for indefinite periods of time include securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates and/or significant prepayment risks. Securities available for sale are carried at market value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in retained earnings. When securities are sold, the adjusted costs of the specific securities sold are used to compute gains or losses on the sales.
<p>
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," in 1994. At adoption, securities totaling $1,509,328 were reclassified from investment securities to securities available for sale. An after-tax gain of $29,987 was carried as a component of retained earnings, representing the unrealized gain in securities available for sale at adoption. During 1994, the fair value of these securities declined, resulting in an after-tax unrealized loss of $51,784. In December 1995, the Company reclassified all of its investment securities, with a carrying value of $232,864 and a fair value of $238,918, to securities available for sale as allowed by SFAS No. 115 implementation guidance. The reclassification resulted in an unrealized gain of $6,054 which was recorded in equity, net of tax. During 1995, the fair value of securities available for sale increased by $66,995, net of tax. The net after-tax unrealized gain recorded as a component of retained earnings since the adoption of SFAS No. 115 is $45,198.
<p>
<STRONG><EM>Loans Held For Sale and Securitization:</EM></STRONG><BR>
Loans held for sale and securitization are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value.
<p>
<STRONG><EM>Investment Securities:</EM></STRONG><BR>
When securities are purchased and at each balance sheet date, they are classified as investment securities if it is management's positive intent and ability to hold them until maturity. These securities are carried at cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, both computed using the effective yield method. During December, 1995, the Company reclassified all of its investment securities to securities available for sale, as discussed in the above Securities Available for Sale section. 
<p>
<STRONG><EM>Loans:</EM></STRONG> <BR>
Interest on loans is computed by methods which generally result in level rates of return on principal amounts outstanding. It is management's practice to cease accruing interest on commercial and real estate loans when payments are 90 days delinquent. However, management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the estimated net realizable value of collateral is sufficient to cover the principal balance and accrued interest, and the loan is in the process of collection. Credit card loans typically are charged off when the loan is six months past due and a minimum payment has not been received for 60 days, while other consumer loans typically are charged off when the loan is six months past due. Credit card and other consumer loans are also charged off when the customer declares bankruptcy. Loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and generally amortized as adjustments of the related loans' yields over their contractual lives except for certain loans (e.g., home equity lines), which consider anticipated prepayments in establishing an economic life. Credit card loan annual membership fees and direct origination costs are deferred and amortized over one year on a straight-line basis. Deferred fees (net of deferred costs) on credit card loans were $1,194 and $33,690 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. 
<p>
<EM><STRONG>Allowance for Loan Losses:</STRONG></EM> <BR>
The allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb anticipated future losses, net of recoveries, in the existing loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an adequate allowance. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, management takes into consideration the following factors: the condition of industries and geographic areas experiencing or expected to experience particular economic adversities; historical charge-off and recovery activity (noting any particular trend changes over recent periods); trends in delinquencies, bankruptcies and non-performing loans; trends in loan volume and size of credit risks; any irrevocable commitments to extend funds; the degree of risk in the composition of the loan portfolio; current and anticipated economic conditions; credit evaluations; and underwriting policies. 
<p>
In 1995, Signet adopted SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," and SFAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - Income Recognition and Disclosures." In accordance with SFAS No. 114, impaired loans are measured and reported based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan"s effective interest rate, or at the fair value of the loan's collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Impaired loans are specifically reviewed loans for which it is probable that the creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the loan agreement. 
<p>
A valuation allowance is required to the extent that the measure of impaired loans is less than the recorded investment.
SFAS No. 114 does not apply to large groups of homogeneous loans such as consumer installment and bank card loans, which are collectively evaluated for impairment. Smaller balance commercial loans are also excluded from the application of the statement. At December 31, 1995, Signet's loans that were considered to be impaired under SFAS No. 114 were comprised of $32,617 of non-accrual loans for which the related allowance for credit losses was $10,598. The average recorded investment in impaired loans during the year ended December 31, 1995 was approximately $28,830. Collateral dependent loans, which were measured at the fair value of the loan's collateral, made up the majority of impaired loans at December 31, 1995.
SFAS No. 118 allows a creditor to use existing methods for recognizing interest income on impaired loans. Interest 
receipts on impaired loans are applied in a manner consistent with Signet"s policy for non-accrual loans. For the year ended 
December 31, 1995, no interest income was recorded on loans once placed on non-accrual status. All interest receipts on 
impaired loans were applied to the principal.
<p>
<EM><STRONG>Premises and Equipment:</STRONG></EM><BR>
 Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less allowances for depreciation and amortization of $173,336 and $208,476 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense are generally computed using the straight-line method. Interest costs relating to the construction of major operating facilities are capitalized using a weighted average rate.
<p>
<STRONG><EM>Foreclosed Property:</EM></STRONG> <BR>
Real estate acquired in satisfaction of a loan is included in other assets and stated at the lower of (1) fair value minus estimated costs to sell; or (2) cost, defined as the fair value of the asset on the date of foreclosure. 
<p>
<STRONG><EM>Intangible Assets:</EM> </STRONG><BR>
Goodwill, representing the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, is amortized on a straight-line basis over periods not exceeding fifteen years. Other acquired intangible assets such as deposit base intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected periods of benefit.
<p>
<EM><STRONG>Preferred Stock:</STRONG></EM> The Company is authorized to issue, in series, up to 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with a par value of $20 per share.
<p>
<STRONG><EM>Risk Management Instruments:</EM></STRONG><BR>
 The Company enters into a variety of interest rate contracts, primarily interest rate swaps, to manage its interest rate exposure through the use of synthetic alteration. Synthetic alteration changes the nature of an interest-earning asset or interest-bearing liability from fixed rate to variable rate or vice versa. These instruments are not marked to market. Related income or expense, including amortization of purchase premiums or settlement gains or losses is recorded as an adjustment to the yield of the related interest-earning asset or interest-bearing liability over the periods covered by the contracts. If an existing asset or liability designated for such accounting treatment matures, is sold, extinguished, or terminated, the risk management instrument is either redesignated to another existing or anticipated asset or liability or terminated. If a risk management instrument designated for such accounting treatment is related to an anticipated transaction that is no longer likely to occur, the instrument is either redesignated to another existing or anticipated asset or liability or terminated. If an instrument is terminated because the related assets or liabilities no longer exist or an anticipated transaction will not occur, any gain or loss is recognized into income; otherwise, any gain or loss is deferred and amortized as an adjustment to the yield of the designated asset or liability over the remaining periods originally covered by the contract. 
<p>
The Company also uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with securitizations. Income or 
expense from these swaps is recorded on an accrual basis along with securitization income in non-interest income.
Sales and Servicing of Loans: Signet periodically securitizes and sells loans, primarily consumer loans such as credit card receivables, home equity lines, and residential mortgage loans. Signet's consumer loans are recorded as sales in accordance with SFAS No. 77, "Reporting by Transferors for Transfers of Receivables with Recourse." Gains on the sale of securitized loans are limited to the amounts related to loans existing at the time of sale and do not include amounts related to future loans 
expected to be sold during the reinvestment period. Due to the relatively short average life of credit card loans, no gain or loss is recorded at the time of sale. Rather, loan servicing fees, which represent credit card interest and fees in excess of interest paid to certificate holders, credit losses, and other trust expenses, are recorded over the life of the transaction as earned. Transaction expenses are deferred and amortized over the reinvestment period of the transaction as a reduction of loan servicing fees. For home equity line securitizations, which have a substantially longer average life, a gain or loss is recorded at the time of the sale equal to the present value of the anticipated future net cash flows, net of transaction expenses and any 
unamortized deferred loan origination costs.
<p>
The majority of Signet's mortgage loan sales are in the secondary market with servicing retained. During the third quarter of 1995, the Company elected to adopt SFAS No. 122, "Accounting for Mortgage Servicing Rights." In accordance with SFAS 
No. 122, the cost of mortgage loans purchased or originated with a definitive plan to sell the loans and retain the mortgage servicing rights is allocated between the loans and the servicing rights based on their estimated fair values at the purchase 
or origination date. The estimated fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined based upon quoted market prices for similar assets, if available, or the results of valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows using an 
appropriate discount rate. In determining the estimated fair value of the mortgage servicing rights, Signet utilizes a discounted cash flow model which incorporates assumptions such as prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, default rates, servicing income, servicing costs, and inflation factors. Once capitalized, mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. 
<p>
For the purpose of evaluating and measuring impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights, SFAS No. 122 requires that such rights be stratified based on one or more of the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans. For Signet, these characteristics include loan type and interest rate. The amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the capitalized mortgage servicing rights in each stratum exceed their fair values and is recorded through a valuation allowance. Subsequent to the initial measurement of impairment, the valuation allowance should be adjusted to reflect changes in the measurement of 
impairment. Fair value in excess of the amount capitalized net of amortization is, however, not recognized. The adoption of these impairment provisions did not require Signet to record a valuation allowance at December 31, 1995 for any of its capitalized mortgage servicing rights, including servicing rights that had been purchased prior to the adoption of the statement.
<p>
The effect of adopting SFAS No. 122 on the Company's consolidated financial statements was an increase in pre-tax 
income of approximately $7.2 million (net of amortization) with a corresponding increase in mortgage servicing rights. The 
additional income resulted from a lower adjusted cost basis of originated mortgage loans sold with servicing retained. In addition to the servicing rights capitalized on originated mortgage servicing rights, Signet capitalized $31.6 million of purchased mortgage servicing rights in 1995. Amortization expense related to mortgage servicing rights was $5.6, $2.2 and $1.5 million for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. At December 31, 1995, Signet's portfolio of capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
totaled $58.7 million and had a market value of $66.0 million.
<p>
<strong><em>Income Taxes:</strong></em><BR>
Prepaid and deferred income taxes are provided for timing differences between income and expense for 
financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes.
<p>
<strong><em>Earnings Per Share: </strong></em><BR>
Earnings per share were based on the average number of shares outstanding and applicable equivalents (stock options).
<p>
<strong><em>Recent Accounting Pronouncements:</strong></em><BR>
SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of," was issued in March, 1995. The statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Signet will adopt the statement beginning January 1, 1996. The effect of adopting SFAS No. 121 is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company.

<p>
<font size=+1>The smell of fresh bagels joyously greeted customers during the June opening of Caple and Shirley Green's new Chesapeake Bagel Bakery (CBB) franchise in the Marshall Heights neighborhood of Washington, D.C. As the first full-service restaurant to open east of the Anacostia River in decades, this new business was welcomed in a community which still struggles to survive.
<p>
"This is a classic example of an economic development project that combines upscale development and consumer choice with local job creation and the potential for the creation of wealth," observed Michael Crescenzo, Marshall Heights Community Development Organization's (MHCDO) Vice President of Housing and Economic Development.
<p>
The first African-American owned Chesapeake Bagel Bakery franchise in its 55-unit chain, the Minnesota Avenue bakery is a combined venture of the Greens, East River Park (an MHCDO subsidiary), National Cooperative Bank Development Corporation (NCBDC), the CBB corporation, and Signet.
<p>
"Many partners who are committed to this neighborhood came together to make a challenging business proposition work," said Dave Gatling, Signet's small business officer who provided the SBA-guaranteed loan.  CBB waived its normal franchising fee.  The Greens and East River Park invested money to renovate, stock and furnish the store. NCBDC funded the employee partnership shares.
<p>
The results are encouraging.  Twenty-six people have been employed, some of whom were offered franchise ownership through payroll deduction.  Business at the store is good, which Chesapeake's President, Alan Manstof, hopes will be "a model for underserved communities."  Local merchants also are enjoying increased customer activity.
<p>
Neighborhood residents now savor the taste of fresh bagels and a variety of other foods -- a welcome addition to an area hungry for new investment.

We are very pleased with what we accomplished in an eight-month time period beginning in July of 1994 when we announced our intentions. We separated all the necessary functions for both organizations, established the new credit card company--Capital One Financial Corporation--and raised more than $100 million in new equity to support its ongoing operations.<p>The process was completed on February 28, 1995, when we transferred Signet's ownership of Capital One directly to our shareholders through a special stock dividend. The two corporations are now entirely independent.<p>At the same time we were managing the spin-off, we engaged in a strategic review of Signet's business practices. After an in-depth analysis, we identified numerous opportunities for increasing efficiency and building shareholder value. We singled out the most important and promising projects,and during the third quarter, took the first steps toward implementing our plans. Although we won't complete all of these tasks for several months, we arealready beginning to reap the benefits of our actions.<p>Both the spin-off and the core bank improvement program required changes that resulted in $92.2 million in special charges in the second half of 1994. Even with these non-recurring charges, we reported net income of $149.8 million, or $2.59 per share for the year.  Excluding the charges, net income was up 20 percent over 1993 to $209.8 million, or $3.63 per share. <p><p><p><b>Creating Shareholder Value</b><p><font size=+3>O</font>ur plan to redesign how Signet does business is a natural extension of our commitment to information based strategies. We simply don't believe it is enough to do better tomorrow what we did yesterday. Consequently, we continue to invest in research and development while we reduce costs in other areas. We believe this approach is crucial to achieving the kinds of returns that create value for our shareholders. <p>Signet has an excellent foundation on which to build. We have worked hard to instill a values-driven, quality-versus-quantity credit culture in our organization. At year-end, non-performing assets were $48.5 million, only .6 percent of loans and foreclosed properties. Our coverage ratios were among the industry's best: reserves were 4.5 times non-performing assets and 2.8 percent of loans outstanding.<p>We ranked first in terms of capital strength among the companies in the Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette bank universe. Year-end common equity was $1.1billion, or 8.60 percent of balance sheet assets. Our target level of capital is between 7 and 8 percent. After transferring nearly $360 million of equity to Capital One, Signet's capital stood at 7.5 percent of assets. <p>In 1994, consumers responded very favorably to our product offers and innovative techniques for providing customer service. At December 31, the company's managed credit card receivables totaled $7.7 billion, marking the second year of explosive asset growth in an increasingly competitive environment. At year-end, the company had over 5 million active credit card accounts nationwide.<p>Other accomplishments last year included:<p><ul><li>completing our acquisition of Pioneer Financial Corporation, a $400 million financial institution based in Chester, Virginia;<p><li>reducing our commercial real estate exposure by $155 million; and<p><li>growing total revenues (net interest income and non-interest income) at an annualized rate of 20 percent.<p></ul> <p><b>New Products and Delivery Channels</b><p><font size=+3>W</font>e continue to expand our use of information based strategies throughout thecompany, and we are pleased with the early results. Our test-marketing has yielded important insights and increased our portfolio of student, home equity and installment loans by 58 percent. Many of our tests--which were conducted in our regional market and across the nation--emphasized consumer loan products other than credit cards.<p>Recently, we announced an agreement to acquire the assets of Sheffield Management Company and Sheffield Investments, Inc., the managers and distributors of the Blanchard group of mutual funds. Via direct mail, Blanchard markets its 11 fixed income and equity funds nationally. We pursued this acquisition because their direct mail expertise blends well with our information based strategies. The addition of the Blanchard portfolio doubles our mutual fund assets and increases our total assets under management to morethan $4 billion. <p>We have been featured in many prominent national publications with respect to our use of imaging and the development of innovative solutions to customer needs. We introduced Rapid Image in 1994. This new product provides our business customers with images of all the checks they process daily. The concept for Rapid Image evolved from listening to our customers and responding to their needs. <p>Last year, Unisys Corporation selected Signet as one of three companies world-wide to receive their "Customerize Award" designed to recognize companies for their commitment to innovative, top quality service through the use of advanced technology. Signet was the only company in the United States selected.<p>We continue to research and implement various ways to increase convenience for our customers. Not only can we offer our services via our 250 branch network and ATM system, we have also had success with our 24-hour Telebanking Center and our bill-paying service. <p>Last year, MasterCard selected Signet as its primary east coast bank to market MasterMoney. This new debit card gives customers an alternative form of payment to a check. Signet's MasterMoney card looks like a credit card, but instead of drawing the payment funds from a credit card loan, it draws the funds directly from a checking account.<p><p><b>Outstanding Efforts</b><p><font size=+3>W</font>e are particularly proud of the extraordinary effort our employees put forth in 1994 to achieve numerous changes in our company. We are fortunate to have talented, dedicated and loyal people who work diligently toward our goal of becoming a top quality national financial services company. <p>Over the years, many employees have worked tirelessly to build a solid foundation for our company. We especially want to recognize those employees who elected to take early retirement in 1994. We are grateful for the years ofservice they gave to Signet and wish them the best. <p>After nine years as a Director of Signet Banking Corporation, Stanley I.Westreich has resigned to join the Board of Directors of Capital One. Over theyears, Stanley has played an active role in building and strengthening our company, and now he will use his expertise to help accomplish the same objectives at Capital One. We thank Stanley for his loyal service, thought-provoking commentary and, most of all, his long-lasting friendship with Signet. We will miss him at our table, but we are delighted he has chosen tofurther the mission of a company that we also believe in strongly. <p>We would like to welcome to our board Bruce C. Gottwald  Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of First Colony Corporation. Bruce has been a valuable member of our Central Virginia Area Board, and we are certain his insights will continue to contribute to Signet's success.<p>This year promises to be very exciting for Signet. We are confident that our efforts will continue to create value for our shareholders and quality service for our customers. We hope you are pleased with the changes we have instituted,and that you will continue to invest in our company.<p><p> Sincerely,</font><p><p><p><p><table border=0 cellpadding=1  width=100%><tr><td><font size=+1><strong>Robert M.

<h2 align=center>Capital One Spin-Off Questions and Answers</h2>

<p>

<b>Overview</b>

<p>

<b></b><font size=+3>O</font>n July 27,1994, we announced our intention to spin off our credit card

division as an independent company. To do this, we established the division as

a subsidiary of Signet Banking Corporation and named it Capital One Financial

Corporation. <p>

In November, we raised more than $100 million of equity for the new credit card

company through an initial public offering (IPO) of 7,125,000 shares. At that

point, Capital One began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the

symbol "COF," and Signet owned 88.5% of its stock.<p>

Last month, we completed the spin-off. At the close of business on February 28,

1995, we transferred Signet's ownership of Capital One directly to Signet

shareholders in a tax-free distribution of stock. Signet shareholders of record

on February 10, 1995 received one share of Capital One stock for each share of

Signet stock they owned. At spin-off, the companies began to operate

independently. <p>

This process, which in theory seems very simple, was extremely complicated to

carry out. The intricacies of the spin-off continue to generate a flood of

questions. Some of the most frequently asked are listed below. <p>

<p>

<b>Why spin off the credit card business? Why not just set up the company

as a Signet subsidiary?</b><p>

<b></b><p>
<dl>
<dd>
The short answer is, simply, to increase shareholder value. "Pure play" or

stand-alone credit card companies generally trade at higher price-to-earnings

multiples than do banks. The credit card industry continues to grow at a faster

pace than most other financial services, and Signet's credit card business was

among the fastest growing in a high growth industry. Our shareholders were in

the unusual position of owning one of the nation's foremost credit card

businesses without the ability to trade or realize directly the value of their

investments.<p>

In addition, the rapid growth in the credit card division was straining the

human resources and funding capacity of the core bank. Now, we can devote full

attention to reaching the objectives we believe are attainable in Signet's

Capital Markets, Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking businesses.<p>
</dl>
<br><b>What is the current relationship between the two companies?</b><p>

<b></b><p>
<dl>
<dd>
Signet and Capital One are now two separate, distinct, independent companies.

We do have some temporary contractual arrangements to provide services for each

other while Capital One completes its infrastructure. These agreements have

been set up on an arm's length basis--the same way we deal with all external

vendors. <p>

We may become direct competitors in many arenas. Excluding credit card

products, however, neither Signet nor Capital One is a dominant player in the

national consumer lending market, so we believe ample opportunity exists for

both companies to grow. Our true challenges lie in competing with other

established firms.<p>
</dl>
<p>

<b>Why did Signet sell shares of Capital One through the IPO rather than

distribute all of them to Signet stockholders?</b><p>

<b></b><p>
<dl>
<dd>
It was important for both Signet and Capital One to have a sound capital base

to sustain future growth. Even with Signet's contribution of almost $360

million, Capital One needed additional equity (raised through the IPO) to

accommodate expected growth. 
</dl>
<p>

<b>How does the Capital One spin-off affect the dividends I already receive

on my Signet shares?</b><p>

<b></b><p>
<dl>
<dd>
Initially the combined annual dividends of Signet and Capital One are intended

to be equivalent to the $1.00 per share that Signet paid previously. That is,

Signet intends to pay $.68 per share and Capital One $.32 per share. As always,

the declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of

Signet's Board of Directors. <p>
</dl>
<p>

<b>Has Signet lost its expertise in information based decision making? Does the

spin-off indicate the core bank is no longer interested in this strategy?</b><p>

<b></b><p>
<dl>
<dd>
We believe as strongly today in information based strategies as we did in 1988

when we began to invest in this technology. Expertise in this area continues to

prevail at Signet, and we are more confident every day that it will be the key

to our future prosperity. <p>

Strategically using information to acquire customers and manage relationships

is a fundamental practice that must be customized for each business. There is

no single model that fits all businesses or products. There are, however, some

similarities between businesses that lend themselves to shared data retrieval

and manipulation.<p>

We have been developing competence in information based strategies in our

non-credit card businesses. Through our experience with the credit card

business, we gained confidence that these strategies could be applied to many

different products and markets. Our recent tests are simply underscoring this

belief. This year alone, we expect to spend in excess of $25 million expanding

our use of information strategies.<p>
</dl>
<p>

<b>With the change in interstate banking laws, are the chances now higher that

Signet will be acquired?</b><p>

<b></b><p>
<dl>
<dd>
We have been on potential acquisition lists since the early 1980's. Our

philosophy has always been--and continues to be--that we will remain

independent by implementing innovative practices and programs that enhance

premium shareholder value. <p>

Our Board of Directors and Management Committee unanimously agree that Signet

has the plans in place to create a highly profitable, national financial

services company.

 | <a href=#future>Signet's Future</a>
<p>
<font size=+3>I</font>n making the decision during 1994 to spin off the credit card business, we
conducted a rigorous review of the current and projected performance of the
core bank and each of its component businesses. From this analysis, we drew the
following conclusions:
<p>
<ul>
<li>the core bank's financial performance was in the 8 - 10% return on equity
(ROE) range;
<p>
<li>our efficiency ratio was in the 80% range;
<p>
<li>not all individual business units were performing above their "hurdle"
rates;
<p>
<li>much of the infrastructure of the company, including funding, was designed to
support the credit card business; and 
<p>
<li>ongoing investments in the core businesses had not yet begun to pay off.
</ul>
<p>
Based on these results, we implemented several programs to transform the core
bank businesses into high performers, and to reduce corporate overhead
significantly. While continuing to conduct the ongoing businesses of the
company, our key managers directed the transformation and downsizing activities
in their respective units. During the second half of 1994, the downsizing
process began, which led to the special charges against earnings in the third
and fourth quarters.
<p>
These special charges consisted of three components: 
<ul>
<li>changing our contract with Electronic Data Systems to discontinue servicing
Capital One;
<p>
<li>downsizing our work force through job eliminations and early retirements;
and
<p>
<li>consolidating several of our facilities.
</ul>
<p>
As a result, Signet expects to lower non-interest expense in 1995. More
importantly, we are transforming our businesses to make them more competitive
and re-engineering our staff units to support our businesses more
effectively.
<p>

<p>
<a name=obj><center><h3>Objectives for 1995-2000</h3></center></a>
<p>
<font size=+3>B</font>ased on our 1994 actions, Signet is now positioned to:
<p>
Maximize shareholder return by using Information Based Decision Making (IBDM)
to create and manage individualized financial products and services for
selected customers in local and national markets.
<p>
We will maximize shareholder return by meeting specific financial targets:
<ul>
<li>reaching a 15-16% ROE in the fourth quarter of 1995, and continuing to rise
thereafter; 
<p>
<li>sustaining earnings per share (EPS) growth of between 12-15% after meeting our
fourth quarter 1995 ROE objective; and 
<p>
<li>maintaining our strong capital and reserve positions.
</ul>
<p>
Achieving these targets will provide shareholder returns over time that we
believe will consistently rank Signet among the industry leaders.
<p>

<p>
<b>Achieving the Objectives</b>
<p>
To achieve these objectives, Signet will implement a series of corporate-wide
strategies in all business units that will continually evolve and change in
response to customer preferences, competition, technology, the economy and
regulations. 
<p>
In 1995, we will operate in three business areas: Capital Markets, Commercial
Banking and Consumer Banking. Our former Real Estate business has been blended
with our new Commercial Banking group. We believe this change will create
synergies that are advantageous to our sales efforts. Under the umbrella of
Consumer Banking, Signet also will continue to offer credit cards in our
regional market area.
<p>
Within each business area, there are strategic business units that focus on
different products, customers, markets, uses for technology and cost
structures.
<p>

<p>
<a name=corpstrat><center><h3>Corporate Strategies</h3></center></a>
<p>
<b>Information Based Decision Making</b>
<p>
<font size=+3>T</font>he principal strategy that differentiates Signet and gives us a competitive
advantage is our competence in IBDM. Essentially, we apply the scientific
method of establishing a hypothesis, testing it to learn more about how
customers make buying decisions, and measuring how those decisions affect our
costs. The diagram on page 13 depicts this process.
<p>
We test our hypotheses using structured data collection and then conduct
careful analyses to enhance knowledge about customer demand, costs, and
economic and financial results. Based on these analyses, marketing programs are
designed to target selected customers with specialized product offers and
pricing. 
<p>
An important result that naturally flows from the IBDM process is the creation
of new products, the addition of new customers and the potential development of
new businesses. This creative dimension ensures Signet will continue to evolve
over time and not become dependent on yesterday's products, customers or
markets.
<p>
Several essential characteristics of IBDM create proprietary value. Signet will
build an ever-increasing database of information and insights about customers
and costs that competitors cannot duplicate in the short run, if at all.
Managing and analyzing the data requires statistical models that are highly
customized and not easily replicated. The data and models are shared among our
businesses and insights gained in one division are readily available to
managers and analysts in others. We believe this shared knowledge will
contribute greatly to the creation of new products and potential markets. 
<p>
IBDM is not a casual process. It must be undertaken with rigor, discipline and
consistency. Part of the discipline is having standards to determine whether
tests being conducted are likely to produce desirable results. We subject our
testing to relatively short time constraints so we know quickly whether to move
ahead or shift into other alternatives. Signet invests not only in hardware and
software to support IBDM, but also in talented people, training, development
and practices.
<p>
The IBDM strategy leads to an open and innovative approach to customer
selection and management. Usually customer targeting is based on such variables
as geography, revenue or income levels, demographics or lifestyles. With IBDM,
we are purely interested in establishing first on a test basis, and then on an
actual basis, the variables we can alter to cause the customer to purchase and
then sustain a profitable relationship. Product design and features, pricing,
distribution channels or service levels are the variables typically used.
<p>
Historically, banks have not had the data or systems to measure customer
profitability. IBDM fundamentally changes all that. We believe that only by
making each customer profitable can we be certain overall performance will meet
targeted levels.
<p>

<p>
<b>Risk Management</b>
<p>
The banking industry has not adequately managed risk in the past. IBDM creates
the opportunity to make risk management more empirical and rigorous, especially
for credit risk and interest rate risk.
<p>
In 1992, Signet began implementing a values-based credit culture that
emphasizes credit quality in all phases of the lending business. Extensive
changes in credit policy, practice and training were instituted. The desired
result of the new credit culture is to limit losses and to lessen fluctuations
in the credit cycle. Credit risk is managed differently for large commercial
credits than for small or consumer credits. 
<p>
Commercial credit risk is managed using a risk rating system derived from
Signet's loss experience. The risk ratings have been developed using actual
data for factors that affect the ability of a company to repay ranging from the
specific industry to financial data to loan structure. Loss experience is
carefully documented for each risk rating including the assignment of capital,
loan loss provision and allowance for each loan. These variables then become
part of the customer profitability calculation.
<p>
Each commercial lending business unit develops a business plan with
specifically defined credit parameters that include types of loans, borrowers,
loan size and industry concentrations. By using the risk rating system with
other historical data, our lenders are able to identify customers who meet our
profit and credit standards. This approach greatly reduces adverse selection or
unknowingly lending to poor credit risks. It also allows us to manage
individual customer loan exposure to minimize concentrations of risk in the
loan portfolio. Concentration of risk is one of the major causes of credit
losses significantly affecting earnings.
<p>
Recently, we have made a structural change in the credit process that shifts
credit expertise closer to decision making, and focuses more on responsibility.
Credit officers, who report to Credit Risk Management, now are assigned to
specific individual businesses. Along with the relationship officers, they are
jointly responsible for the long-term performance of the loan.
<p>
Individual or consumer credit risk also is managed to reduce adverse selection.
We lend in relatively small increments to consumers across a wide spectrum of
demographics and geographics to minimize the impact  of changes in local
economies on our portfolio. Even though this greatly reduces credit exposure,
large portfolios acquired without proper credit management also can have
negative effects on earnings. For consumer portfolios, the testing process
allows managers to determine the boundaries of acceptable credit exposure.
Again, because we are selecting customers after extensive testing, adverse
selection is greatly reduced.
<p>
Interest rate risk management is under the guidance of the Asset and Liability
Committee. The principal tool for assessing interest rate exposures is the
simulation of the performance of net interest income under alternative interest
rate conditions. Projected rates are raised or lowered and the relationships
between long- and short-term rates are altered. These tests are conducted to
help determine the optimal asset and liability mix for achieving financial
performance targets without creating excessive rate exposure.
<p>
Managing operating risk (the dynamic of having high fixed costs and variable
revenue) is becoming more important. Signet and other banks are engaging in
many businesses that are fee-based and have a large proportion of fixed costs
in processing hardware, software and facilities. Flexibility to move in and out
of businesses as external conditions change will be key. We will limit our
exposure to operating risk by avoiding businesses with high fixed cost
structures or finding innovative ways to conduct such businesses differently.
<p>

<p>
<b>Technology Management</b>
<p>
We manage technology to provide our business units with the flexibility to
acquire, configure and manage data. This includes the selection and development
of appropriate hardware, software, network capabilities and people. We also
provide centralized expertise and corporate standards for data and systems that
support sharing data and avoid unnecessary duplication of resources.
<p>
The essential ingredients of this approach include principles for data,
software, infrastructure and organization. It also includes the thoughtful
placement of technical resources in both the businesses and the corporate
Information Technology function, which is responsible for managing the
company-wide technology capability.
<p>

<p>
<b>People Management</b>
<p>
Signet is creating an environment for its employees that enables individuals to
achieve their full business potential with the highest ethical standards.
Recruiting and hiring are focused on those individuals who are required to
support both corporate-wide and business unit strategies. Today, that means
more employees with disciplined, strong analytical capabilities. 
<p>
We are creating development programs that align individual goals and business
goals. When people engage in activities they really care about, they have much
higher energy levels. This benefits both our employees and our businesses.
Employee development emphasizes continuous learning and creativity in support
of IBDM.
<p>

<p>
<a name=custserv><h3 align=center>Customer Service</h3></a>
<p>
<font size=+3>T</font>he new horizons we are exploring at Signet have led to interesting
insights about how we can better serve our customers and support the
communities in our regional market area. For instance, through IBDM we have
learned that profitable customers exist in every demographic and geographic
segment. The key is matching the right products with the right individuals, and
developing delivery channels that make banking easier no matter where the
customer is physically located. 
<p>
Our current delivery channels offer a wide variety of choices.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Signet has a 24-hours a day, 7-days a week Telebanking Center (1-800-2-SIGNET)
through which customers can open accounts, apply for loans or get service on
their existing accounts. 
<p>
<li>We are testing product delivery through the Internet by offering comprehensive
information and applications for student loans. 
<p>
<li>We offer no-load mutual funds via direct mail.
<p>
<li>We continue to maintain an active branch network for individuals who prefer to
bank at their local branch. 	
</ul>
 
<p>
<a name=comminv><h3 align=center>Community Investment</h3></a>
<p>
<font size=+3>W</font>e take our responsibility to Signet's communities very seriously. Our
investments through lending, grants and technical assistance continue to expand
in number and yield positive results. By partnering with community
organizations, government agencies, neighborhood groups and multi-bank
consortia, Signet helps provide affordable housing, small business growth,
economic development, neighborhood revitalization and job creation in many
communities where we do business.
<p>
The following examples typify the projects we fund and actively support in each
of our banks:
<ul>
<li>The Northeast Partnership in Maryland--Spearheaded by Signet, this partnership
with Baltimore Gas Electric, the Mayor's office and many neighborhood groups
addresses key community concerns--including affordable housing, small business
revitalization, crime and safety, education and recreation--in the northeast
corridor of Baltimore City. 
<p>
<li>The Washington, D.C. Community Development Support Collaborative--Founded by
Signet and a wide array of foundation, government and private sector support,
the Collaborative provides long-term operating grants, training and technical
assistance to District of Columbia community support organizations engaged in
affordable housing production and other neighborhood revitalization activities.

<p>
<li>Signet Government Loan Center--In October, we began testing a Government Loan
Center in Virginia. This one-stop shop helps small businesses identify,
understand and apply for the best government lending programs available.
Through the Center, Signet helps small businesses grow, which in turn adds jobs
and helps revitalize our local economies.
</ul>
 
<p>
<a name=future><h3 align=center>Signet's Future</h3></a>
<p>
<font size=+3>I</font>n the years ahead, Signet will grow and become more profitable as we expand
selected products into national markets and strengthen other products in our
traditional regional market. Systematic innovation and creativity derived from
the rigorous application of information based decision making will provide the
foundation for creating premium shareholder value. 
<p>
By the turn of the century, Signet will be a financial services company much
different from our traditional counterparts. Although our mix of customers,
products and markets will change, we will continue to emphasize quality and
performance. We will focus on meeting our customers' needs, generating value
for our shareholders, and creating a healthy, prosperous work environment for
our employees.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Heading1">Frequently Asked Questions about Security</A></H2>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading2">Is it safe?</A></H3>
<P>Yes. While it is understandable that you be concerned about the safety of
your financial data, remember that almost everything that you can do with
Signet Online<sup>sm</sup> Web Banking you can also do over the phone, and probably would without
concern. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Add to this our encryption and authentication, and you have a special security
procedure that isn't available over the telephone, the fax, or even by mail.</P>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading3">Do I need special software?</A></H3>
<P>No. All you need is a browser that supports the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
level 2. These include Netscape Navigator 3.x, Netscape Navigator 2.02,
and Microsoft's Internet Explorer version 3.x. Other advanced browsers may
work also; feel free to experiment. If a browser doesn't support the necessary
security features, you will merely receive an error message from the server.</P>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading5">What can I do to improve security?</A></H3>
<P>Open Netscape's Security Preferences, then click the &quot;General&quot; tab. Make
sure all the &quot;Show an Alert before...&quot; boxes are checked. Be certain the
box marked &quot;Enable SSL v3&quot; is checked, then click the Configure button next
to it. If your browser supports 128 bit encryption, make sure it is checked.
If all you see is 40-bit options, get the registered, domestic version of
the browser from your Internet service provider, Netscape, or your local
software store. This version, available only to US residents, supports the
much more secure 128-bit encryption. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Note that any settings you change will affect all secure sessions, not just
your connections to Signet Online<sup>sm</sup> Web Banking.</P>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading6">I'm not worried about security. How can I improve performance?</A></H3>
<P>You can improve performance at the expense of security in Netscape's Security
Preferences. </P>
<P>Open Security Preferences, then click the &quot;General&quot; tab. Make sure all the
&quot;Show an Alert before...&quot; boxes are unchecked. Be certain the box marked
&quot;Enable SSL v3&quot; is checked, then click the Configure button next to it.
Set the encryption options to 40-bit encryption.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Note that any settings you change will affect all secure sessions, not just
your connections to Signet Online<sup>sm</sup> Web Banking.</P>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading7">What's all this about 40-bits and 128-bits?</A></H3>
<P>A properly designed encryption algorithm is only breakable by attacking
it with &quot;brute-force&quot; methods. In other words, the fastest way to break
the cipher is to try every possible key. The number of bits in such an algorithm
represents the number of possible keys, and thus the difficulty of breaking
it. </P>
<P></P>
<P>A 40-bit key has 2<sup>40</sup>, or about a trillion, possible combinations. A fast mainframe computer
capable of 64 million instructions per second could work on nothing else
for a year and still have only a 50-50 chance of breaking a 40-bit key.</P>
<P></P>
<P>A 128-bit key has 2<sup>128</sup>, or about two hundred trillion <B>times</B> more possible combinations than 40-bit. This is rather more secure, as
the same mainframe would have to spend two hundred trillion years before
it had its 50% chance of success! </P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Heading8">A More Detailed Discussion of Security and Encryption</A></H2>
<P>It happens to everyone. As soon as you got on the Internet, some friend
or co-worker came up and asked, &quot;Aren't you afraid? I've heard it's not <B>safe</B>.&quot;</P>
<P></P>
<P>The media, TV in particular, have made a big deal about the risks of the
Internet. The colorful world of hackers and crackers, even the terms: Virus,
Trojan Horse, Public-Key Encryption, all have a ring of espionage that makes
for good, sensational TV. The reality is a more prosaic, but no less important.
Let's discuss how Internet Security relates to you and, specifically, the
Signet Online<sup>sm</sup> service. </P>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading9">What's at risk?</A></H3>
<P>To begin with, let's touch briefly on the real risks: At no time are you,
or anyone else using the Signet Online<sup>sm</sup> service connected directly to the Signet Bank computers where your money
is &quot;kept.&quot; If the worst possible thing happened, and your computer was stolen
with your User ID and Password taped to the monitor, the absolute most any
bad guy could do would be to look at your balances, read your mail, and
move money between <B>your</B> accounts. </P>
<P></P>
<P>So, understand that your money is <B>safe</B>. What is at risk here is your privacy. This is your bank mail, your account,
and no-one is supposed to see it but you. All the extensive protection we
have implemented is there to protect your privacy. </P>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading10">What's beyond our control?</A></H3>
<P>Of course, if you actually leave your User ID and Password taped to your
monitor, there's nothing we can do. You probably know someone who writes
their PIN number on their ATM card and this is just as foolish. Don't do
it.</P>
<P></P>
<P>There's one other thing we can't control, and in this sense the TV is right:
We can't keep someone from seeing anything you send over the Internet. The
structure of the Net itself makes it impossible. It's a public net, and
someone with the appropriate hardware can get a look at just about any chunk
of traffic -- similar to the way anyone can <B>look</B> at your car as you drive it on a public street. What we can do is make
it impossible for them to do anything <B>with</B> it. This is why most Internet security focuses on encryption -- the wired
equivalent of locking your car. As you'll see, though, we have some tricks
you could never use with a car.</P>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading11">What we do to protect you</A></H3>
<P>We're about to get technical here, but bear with us. We have many security
features involved for your protection, but each protects against a different
threat. Our first level of defense is your User ID and Password. We use
these to assure that you are the person on the other end of the line. From
there, things get more complex. Our server is designed to implement the
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, a very advanced form of security which
involves authentication, encryption, and verification. Let's take a look
at a session:</P>
<P></P>
<P>When you first access the Signet Web site, you are communicating normally.
Anything you send over the net, and anything our server sends back, are
&quot;in the clear;&quot; anyone intercepting your communications would be able to
see everything you type, and every page we send. Once you enter the secure
area, however, (by pressing the &quot;Continue&quot; button on the Welcome page) everything
changes.</P>
<P></P>
<P>First, your browser and our server go through a special procedure called
a handshake. </P>
<P>To begin, the server sends you our security certificate. This allows your
browser to satisfy itself that you are actually connected to our server.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Then they each generate two keys: Your browser creates a key for sending
that can only be deciphered by our server, and another key for deciphering
messages sent from our server. Our server also uses one key to send to and
one to receive from your browser. The keys are encrypted and securely exchanged.</P>
<P><!-- <p>
(Note that even our server can't read messages encrypted to be sent to you.
Neither can your browser understand its own messages encrypted for our server.
This is possible through public-key encryption, which provides one-way locks
for data. You can freely give your public key to your friends (or even your
enemies), because it can only be used to encrypt messages to you, never to
decrypt them. Knowing someone's public key provides no clue to help decipher
their messages.)<p> --></P>
<P>Next, they negotiate the security algorithms they will use for encrypting
messages (usually either a 40-bit or a more secure 128-bit algorithm). Your
browser tells our server which algorithms it supports, and our server chooses
the strongest.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Now that the line is secured, the server prompts you for your User ID and
Password. When you have entered these correctly, you pass on into the Web
Banking section itself.</P>
<P></P>
<P>At this point, communication between your browser and our server continues
&quot;normally,&quot; with the additional step that every message continues to be
encrypted with the session's keys. Each set of keys is used only for a single
session; even if the hypothetical mainframe spent its year (or trillion)
cracking today's session, it would have to start from scratch to break tomorrow's.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Finally, to guard against someone sitting down and using your computer when
you leave the room, we have a time-out feature. If you request no new data
from the server in three to 15 minutes (you can set the time in the Options
section), our server disconnects you automatically. If you wish to log in
again, you and your browser will have to go to the Welcome page and go through
the above steps all over again. Though typing your User ID and Password
in again is a bother, your browser certainly has the lion's share of the
work. Of course the hypothetical bad guy has the truly insurmountable task,
which is, after all, the point!</P>

<FONT SIZE=+1>There are numerous benefits to keeping a portion of your funds in savings accounts.  First, should you need ready access to your money, savings accounts are a good option.  In addition to ready access, savings accounts with banks offer insurance through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) on balances up to $100,000 per depositor.  In addition, your balances can serve as one important factor in measuring your suitability for certain credit products. Finally, you can now link a personal savings account to <A HREF="/online/so1.htm">PC Banking with Signet OnLine</FONT><SUP>sm</SUP><FONT SIZE="+1">Banking Services</A>.</P>
<P>

There are many flavors of savings accounts on the market, but most fall into one of three classes:  statement savings accounts, passbook accounts, and money market accounts.  The best choice is a function of your current and future needs.  A general rule to remember is that you should keep at least 3-months of living expenses accessible in one or more of these  account types.<P>

<UL>
<LI>Statement Accounts:  Statement accounts allow you to withdraw and deposit funds, while earning a set rate of interest on your deposits.  Transaction histories are disclosed on a monthly or quarterly statement.  You can also manage this account using an ATM or debit card.<P>
<LI>Money Market Accounts:  Money market savings accounts usually offer the highest interest rates of all savings categories.  Generally, a minimum balance is required to receive the interest credit. In addition to competitive interest rates, you can access your funds by check (limited to a certain number per month).

</CENTER><CENTER><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="5">Security:</FONT></P>
</CENTER><P>See our <A HREF="so_secur.htm">security page</A> for a detailed explanation of the many ways Signet OnLine<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">sm</FONT></SUP> Banking Services keep your PC Banking transactions and communications secure.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B><A NAME="pin1">What if I lose or forget my PIN number?</B></A> </P>
<UL>
<LI>If you lose or forget your PIN number, contact Signet. We can either issue
you a new PIN or reset your last issued OnLine Banking PIN. If you have
your initial online banking PIN, a Signet representative can reset your
PIN for you. If you do not have the initial online banking PIN, a new PIN
will be mailed to you. Access to your accounts after a PIN reset takes about
3-4 minutes. If the PIN is reissued it takes 7-10 days for you to receive
the new PIN number in the U.S. Mail. It's important to protect your PIN. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="pin2">Will there be a guideline in place to change my password or PIN to ensure
that it is secure?</B></A> </P>
<UL>
<LI>A customer has the option with Intuit's system to change their PIN as frequently
as he or she wants. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="pin3">Why am I getting an invalid PIN error message?</B></A> </P>
<UL>
<LI>Microsoft<SUP>&#174;</SUP> Money and Quicken<SUP>&#174;</SUP> software both allow a customer to use Alpha-Numeric PIN numbers (i.e. a
combination of numbers and letters), however the PIN is case sensitive.
This means that if you use lower case letters in your PIN and then try entering
the PIN with upper case letters, you will receive an &quot;Invalid PIN&quot; error
message. Letter case must match. 
<LI>Please check this information prior to requesting a PIN reset. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="system">Will my banking records be lost if my computer has a system failure?</B></A> </P>
<UL>
<LI>If you experience a computer failure during transmission, you may attempt
to receive account information later that day once your system is functioning.
If you are having problems with your PC, we suggest you create back up files
on a regular schedule. If your system fails before you back up your files,
contact us at 1-800-461-2945 and our customer service representatives will
provide you with detailed account information needed to rebuild your files. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="hacker">Can Intuit's server be broken into by a hacker?</B></A> </P>
<UL>
<LI>Signet's service provider, Intuit Inc., uses state of the art components
to build a secure server. Intuit uses encryption and firewall technologies
to provide extensive protection for the server. In addition, Intuit has
several measures in place to maintain a secure on-site location. To learn
more about the security features Intuit and Signet OnLine<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">sm</FONT></SUP><FONT SIZE="1"> </FONT>Banking Services use, visit our <A HREF="so_secur.htm">security page</A>. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="virus">Can Intuit's server give my computer a virus? </B></A></P>
<UL>
<LI>No. Because no software is downloaded to your computer from the Intuit server,
a software virus cannot come in contact with your hardware. In addition,
Intuit has several measures in place to maintain a secure on-site location. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="harddisk">Is any information on my hard disk read by Intuit's server?</B></A></P>
<UL>
<LI>Intuit's server is unable to read your hard disk. The only information Intuit
receives from your computer is what you transmit to Intuit by e-mail, funds
transfer instructions, and bill payment instructions. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>

<UL>
<LI>Your bank account information remains with Signet. No one at Intuit has
access to your bank account. The Intuit server only receives your e-mail
messages, funds transfer instructions, and bill payment instructions in
an encrypted format.

</CENTER><P><B><A NAME="how">How are OnLine Payments made?</B></A></P>
<UL>
<LI>Online payments are easily done using software from the comfort of your
home. Payments can be requested to anyone in the United States as long as
you have a valid name, address, and phone number for them. Intuit Services
Corporation (our service provider) guarantees that payments will reach their
designation within four business days. If, for some reason, your payments
do not reach their destination within the allotted time, and you have entered
all of the payment information accurately and within the specified time
frame needed to process payments, Intuit will reimburse you for any late
fees, penalties, or interest you incur due to the late payment.<BR>
 <BR>
 
<LI>Once your payment order is received at Intuit Services Corporation (ISC),
your payment is initiated as quickly as possible. Payments will be made
one of three ways: <BR>
 <BR>
 
<UL>
<LI>Electronic Funds Transfer between the merchant and ISC 
<LI>Paper draft from your account sent via overnight delivery 
<LI>Paper draft from your account sent via the U.S. Postal Service first class<BR>
 <BR>
 
</UL>
<LI>When payments are being made we prefer to send them through an electronic
funds transfer (EFT). EFT's only take one business day to process and normally
clear your account within two business days. <BR>
 <BR>
 
<LI>If a merchant receives several payments from our customers, we will group
those payments together and overnight them to that merchant. This type of
payment normally clears your account within two to five business days. <BR>
 <BR>
 
<LI>If neither of the above methods can be used, then a paper draft will be
sent through first class mail. These payments customarily clear your account
within three to seven business days. <BR>
 <BR>
 
<LI>Although we ensure that your payments will reach their destination in a
timely manner, once they reach that destination they are in the hands of
the merchant. Normally, it takes between one and four days to credit a customer's
account. Some merchants are aware of their processing time so they post
the payment based on the date it was received rather than the date it was
processed. Although we are using the quickest means possible to send your
payments, please understand that this process may take several days. You
may want to allow for extra processing days when filling in a due date for
an online payment.

<P><B><A NAME="makepay">How Do I Make an OnLine Payment? </B></A></P>
<UL>
<LI>If you are using Quicken<SUP>&#174;</SUP>: 
<UL>
<LI>Go To OnLine Bill Payment 
<LI>The date on the check will appear as ASAP. 
<LI>If you want a later date you must enter it here. 
<LI>Once you have filled in the payee, Quicken will fill in the earliest date
it can make the payment. 
<LI>The first time you enter a payee, you must choose &quot;set up&quot; to enter the
payee's billing information, such as address and phone number. 
<LI>Next, enter the amount of the payment you wish to send. 
<LI>Enter a memo in the memo field, preferably an account number if applicable.

<LI>You now see all the checks you have written 
<LI>Click on &quot;Send&quot; again and follow the prompts from the software. 
<LI>You can send an order for a payment to Signet Bank at any time of the day
or night. 
<LI>Quicken will also remind you that you haven't sent the payment request when
exiting by asking if you would like to send the payment request before closing
the program. <BR>
 <BR>

</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="towhom">To whom can I send electronic payments?</B></A> </P>
<UL>
<LI>Electronic payments may be sent to anyone in the United States who has an
address and phone number. Signet Bank reserves the right to refuse to initiate
transfers or payments to certain payees and will notify you immediately
if such a decision is made. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="payee">How will the payee know how to credit my account correctly?</B></A> </P>
<UL>
<LI>Along with your OnLine Payment you are always sending an account number.
As long as you entered that account number correctly when you initially
set up the payment, the payee will know which account to credit. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="howlong">How long does it take for a payment to reach the payee? </B></A></P>
<UL>
<LI>The amount of time it takes for a payee to receive an OnLine Payment depends
on whether they are able to accept electronic payments. If the payee is
able to accept electronic payments, they will receive the payment within
two business days. Otherwise the payee will receive the payment within four
business days. Using the Payment Details feature on your software, you can
find out how long it takes for a payee to receive the payment. Signet strongly
recommends entering online payments so they are set to arrive a few days
before the payment due date to ensure timely payment is made. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="howlong1">Are all payments electronic? </B></A></P>
<UL>
<LI>All payments are not sent electronically at this time. If the payee is able
to accept electronic payments (usually larger businesses or financial institutions)
they will receive your OnLine Payments electronically. If the payee is not
able to accept OnLine Payments, they will receive the payment in the form
of a check. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="inquiry">How do I conduct a payment inquiry?</B></A> </P>
<UL>
<LI>Before contacting Signet regarding a payment inquiry, please contact the
payee to ascertain the status of the payment. If the payee has not received
the payment or credited your account, verify that the information you supplied
in setting up the payment agrees with the merchant information. Please write
down the correct information and the name of the person who helps you, for
future reference. Next, check to see if the payment has cleared your Signet
deposit account. If the payment has already cleared, obtain a copy of the
check to show the merchant so that you may obtain proper credit. If the
payment has not cleared your Signet account, e-mail Signet to initiate a
payment inquiry. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="inquirywait">How long should I wait to begin a payment inquiry?</B></A> </P>
<UL>
<LI>After a payment is received by a person/merchant, it may take several more
days before the check actually clears your account. We recommend that you
wait 14 days after you sent the transaction before conducting a payment
inquiry. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="stop">How do I stop an OnLine Payment?</B></A> </P>
<P>You can stop an OnLine Payment only if the Payment hasn't been processed
by Intuit. Payments are processed based on the lead time for the payee,
which is show in the Online Payees screen. Usually payments can be stopped
up to three days before a payment is scheduled to be initiated. </P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="when">With OnLine Payment does the money leave my account right away?</B></A> </P>
<UL>
<LI>No. The two ways for a payment to clear your account are as follows: 
<UL>
<LI>The payee you send a payment to receives a paper draft in the mail. When
the draft is deposited or cashed, on or after the payment date, it clears
your account. 
<LI>If a payee accepts electronic funds transfers (EFT) the payment will be
received by the payee within 1 business day, and clear your account two
days after payment has been sent. 
</UL>
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="count">Does a stop payment count as a OnLine Payment transaction?</B></A> </P>
<UL>
<LI>No. Any electronic payments that you stop before they are executed by Intuit
(our OnLine Payment service provider) will not be counted in the number
of electronic payments made that month. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="multiple">Can I sign up for OnLine Payment with more than one financial institution? </B></A></P>
<UL>
<LI>If you use the same data file, you cannot use more than one financial institution
to perform OnLine Payments. If you have separate accounts using separate
data files, you can sign up each account at different financial institutions. 
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="confirm">How do I confirm that an electronic payment has been made?</B></A></P>
<UL>
<LI>You can confirm an electronic payment in two ways: 1) wait for your bank
statement, which will contain the transaction date, check number, and the
payment amount, or 2) if the payment date has passed, check its status online. 
<UL>
<LI>In Quicken<SUP>&#174;</SUP>
<UL>
<LI>Go to the account register against which the payment was drawn 
<LI>Go to the edit menu and select 'Payment Inquiry' 
<LI>The status of the payment will be displayed in the window that appears 
</UL>
<LI>In Microsoft<SUP>&#174;</SUP> Money

<LI>In the bottom portion of the screen is a listing of electronic payments
and their status. 
</UL>

</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="so_pcfaq.htm">Back to Table of Contents</FONT></A></P>
<P><B><A NAME="repeat">What is an online recurring payment?</B></A> </P>
<UL>
<LI>An online recurring payment is a future scheduled payment which occurs at
regular intervals (i.e. rent or mortgage.) When you set up a recurring payment,
your software package will prompt you when the pending transaction needs
to be made. Recurring payments can be set for various time intervals such
as monthly and bi-monthly. Setting up recurring payments is a great way
to help you plan your financial affairs into the future.

<font size=4><em>As you look through this guide, you'll see plenty of hard facts about money: stocks, bonds, investment portfolios. 
But the real subject is YOU. After all, it's your money, working to help you attain your goals. </em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>And what you need is an action plan: a guide to help you make the most of your money and its earning power. </em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>How do you invest the money you have to help make your dreams a reality? There is no one magic answer, no 
&quot;hot tip&quot; that is true for every investor. </em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>Some people are natural &quot;savers.&quot; They don't need a specific reason to put aside some of their income. Others 
need a target, a goal plus a set amount they know they need to invest every month. </em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>In addition, you need to decide where to invest your money in order to pursue your goals. Investing links your 
money to the whirlwind of forces in the active market. While there can be no guarantees, people invest in the hope 
of seeing market forces get behind their money, and help it work more effectively toward their goals. </em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>The real purpose of this guide is to provide some fundamental information on the choices available to you. </em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>Then, as an informed investor, you can formulate a plan that you feel comfortable with, and that you feel will 
help you pursue your financial goals. </em></font></p>

<P>

<dd><font size=+1>S</font>IGNET BANK'S Government Contractor Lending Unit is headquartered

just outside of Washington D.C. in Falls Church, Virginia. We

have a team of experienced professionals dedicated solely to the

government contractor market. This unit currently provides banking

services to more than 160 government contractors and high technology

firms in the Washington, D.C. area and has expanded to include

the national market as well.

<P>

<dd><font size=+1>W</font>e have had a special group for financing government contractors for over 10 years and

have decided that financing a systems integrator in Boulder, Colorado

is not much different from financing a systems integrator in Washington,

D.C. Our industry expertise travels well.

<P>

<dd><font size=+1>W</font>ith years of experience in government contract banking, our managers

have a strong understanding of the Federal procurement market, its

unique language and the demands placed on firms that operate within

it. Suppose that you are about to win a major award which will

double your revenues. SIGNET can help with your credit needs because

we understand that you will need to hire and pay additional staff

long before you receive your first contract payment, and we can structure financing to meet these needs.

<P>

<dd><font size=+1>O</font>ur <A HREF="contract.htm"><B>Contract Financing Program</A></B> was established to help

growing firms obtain cash based on the size and quality of the

Federal government prime or subcontracts, which are assigned or

pledged. This allows borrowing availability to be more a function

of contract type than historical earnings and equity position.

<P>

<dd><font size=+1>O</font>ur clients range from young companies in various SBA programs

to well-established publicly traded corporations. Professional

service firms, systems integrators and manufacturers operating

in both prime and subcontractor roles benefit from our unique

offerings.<BR>

<B><dd>Our Contract Financing Program</B> is designed to help growing firms obtain cash
 based on the size and quality of their qualifying federal government contracts.  Therefore, 
 borrowing availability is a function of the type of contract and not primarily tied to historical
 earnings performance and capital accumulation.

<dl>
<DD><B>Types of companies which may benefit from this program:</B><br>
<dl>
<DD><LI>Emerging firms with newly acquired contracts.
<dd><li>Companies which have recently received 8(a) certification.
<dd><LI>Mature businesses which have experienced a temporary financial setback.</DL><BR>
<DD><B>General benefits of our program:</B><BR>
<dl>
<DD><LI>Immediate cash based on verifiable invoices.
<LI>Emphasis on quality of collateral versus balance sheet.
<LI>Full service banking credit, investment, and cash management.
<LI>Less expensive alternative to factors and commercial finance companies.
<LI>A credit decision within three working days of receipt of a completed application.</DL><BR>
<DD><B>We are committed to finding solutions to various types of financial requests.  Credit
facilities which have been approved under our Contract Financing Program include:</B><BR>
<dl>
<DD><li><i>Start-up Business</i> (no significant financial trends) $150,000 line of credit to 
finance their first government contract.<BR>
<i><li>Replaced High Cost Private Investor:</i> $500,000 line of credit to finance three
contracts with separate federal agencies.<BR>

Fund Profile: Blanchard Flexible Tax-Free Bond Fund</font> </p>
<p align=center><img src="images/4stars.gif" alt="Four Stars" align=absmiddle width=66 height=18></p>
<p align=center><font size=4>Morningstar overall rating out of 1,129 municipal bond funds for 3 years ending 12/31/96.</font></p>
<p align=center>Based on historical risk-adjusted performance and subject to change each month.<br>
(See Performance Update below for a more complete explanation.) </p>
<p align=center><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15> </p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bbirdman2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=50 height=61></font><font size=4><b>Investment Objective:</b> The Blanchard Flexible Tax-Free Bond Fund investment objective is to provide a high level of 
current interest income exempt from Federal income tax consistent with preservation of capital. </font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15></font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bmaze2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=80 height=62></font><font size=4><b>Investment Strategy:</b> The Blanchard Flexible Tax-Free Bond Fund invests entirely in municipal bonds whose yields 
are exempt from Federal income tax, so investors keep more of what they earn. The higher an investor's Federal tax 
bracket, the greater this tax-free advantage may be over a comparable taxable investment. In addition, though taxable, 
any capital gains the Fund earns will contribute to an investor's overall total return. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Unlike some municipal bond funds which focus primarily on securities of a single-length maturity, the Blanchard Flexible Tax-Free 
Bond Fund has the flexibility to adjust its average portfolio maturity in an attempt to adapt to prevailing interest rate risks. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Thus, if interest rates appear likely to fall, the Fund can extend its average portfolio maturity in pursuit of higher yields and potential 
capital gains. If interest rates appear likely to rise, the Fund can reduce average portfolio maturity in an attempt to reduce risk and 
volatility. The Fund's manager has no restrictions imposed that might interfere with the ability to manage the Fund. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>In addition, the Fund invests in only the top three grades of municipal bonds, in an effort to reduce the risk of default and maintain a 
high level of liquidity. As a way of further diversifying risk and potentially expanding opportunities to profit, the fund does not 
restrict its portfolio to a single state or municipality. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Naturally, there can be no guarantee that the Fund will meet its objectives. </font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15></font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bmind2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=50 height=63></font><font size=4><b>Manager's Profile:</b> The Fund's chief portfolio manager is Ken McAlley, an executive vice president with the United States 
Trust Company of New York and a nationally recognized expert in municipal bond investing. He has been favorably 
profiled in such prominent financial publications as Barron's, Forbes, and Financial World. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Normally, the minimum investment required for a privately managed account with U.S. Trust Company is beyond the financial reach 
of most individual investors. However, through the auspices of the Blanchard Flexible Tax-Free Bond Fund, individual investors 
can take advantage of their expertise with a minimum investment as low as $3,000 ($2,000 for IRA's). </font></p>
<p><font size=4>(Please note: Virtus Capital Management, Inc., an affiliate of Signet Financial Services, Inc., is the Fund's investment advisor.) </font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15></font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bbalance2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=55 height=105></font><font size=4><b>Risk Profile:</b> </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Average Portfolio Quality: &quot;AA&quot; (Source: U.S. Trust Company, as of 12/31/96) </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Average Portfolio Maturity: 11.5 years (Source: US. Trust Company, as of 12/31/96) </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Mr. McAlley is a &quot;total return manager.&quot; Based on his years of experience in municipal bond management, he believes in the 
aggressive pursuit of income and capital gains. While at times this approach may result in higher total returns, it may also result in 
greater volatility of share price. Thus his style is appropriate for investors who are willing to accept a higher degree of volatility in 
exchange for a potentially higher total return. </font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>As with any fixed income fund, investment return, yield and principal value of the Blanchard Flexible Tax-Free Bond Fund will 
vary with changing market conditions so that an investor's shares, when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original 
purchase price. </em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>In addition, some of the income earned by the Fund may be subject to a Federal alternative minimum tax, and state and local 
taxes. Investors should consult their tax advisor as to the tax consequence, if any, of this Fund.</em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>The Fund is designed for investors whose investment objective is a tax-advantaged investment seeking current income and 
preservation of capital and who are willing to accept a moderate level of market risk and volatility. </em><i>It is recommended that 
investors in this Fund not need access to their principal for several years. Since diversification lowers the risk of investing 
generally, no one investment should comprise more than 25% of your investment portfolio.</i></font></p>

Fund Profile: Blanchard Growth &amp; Income Fund</font> </p>
<p align=center><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15> </p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bbirdman2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=50 height=61></font><font size=4><b>Investment Objective:</b> The Blanchard Growth &amp; Income Fund Portfolio seeks a combination of long-term capital 
appreciation and to provide dividend income. </font></p>
<p><font size=4><i>Unlike other mutual funds which directly acquire and manage their own portfolio securities, the Blanchard Growth &amp; 
Income Fund seeks to meet its investment objectives by investing 100% of its assets in the institutional Chase Growth &amp; Income 
Portfolio managed by Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. </i></font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15></font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bmaze2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=80 height=62></font><font size=4><b>Investment Strategy:</b> The Fund seeks to achieve its growth objective by focusing on uncovering large, high-quality, 
and under-valued companies which are traditionally less volatile in terms of market price than more-aggressive small 
company stocks (although it can invest in small company stocks if, in the opinion of the management team, potential 
profit opportunities arise). </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Naturally, there can be no guarantee that the Fund's Portfolio will meet its objectives. </font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15></font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bmind2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=50 height=63></font><font size=4><b>Manager's Profile:</b> An independent team of top equity analysts at Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., one of the nation's 
premier financial institutions, makes the stock selections and manages the daily operations of the Institutional Chase Growth 
&amp; Income Portfolio in which the Blanchard Growth &amp; Income Fund invests. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Using the vast worldwide research resources available at Chase, including exclusive proprietary computer models used by Chase for 
their own institutional and trust clients, the managers are able to keep a constant watch on thousands of companies in their quest for 
undiscovered, undervalued opportunities with the potential for significant capital gains over time. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Individuals can put these top analysts to work for them through the auspices of the Blanchard Growth &amp; Income Fund with a 
minimum initial investment as small as $3,000 ($2,000 for an IRA). </font></p>
<p><font size=4>(Please note: Virtus Capital Management, Inc., an affiliate of Signet Financial Services, Inc., is the Fund's investment advisor.) </font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15></font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bbalance2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=55 height=105></font><font size=4><b>Risk Profile:</b> </font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>As with any equity fund, investment return and principal value of the Blanchard Growth &amp; Income Fund will vary with 
changing market conditions so that an investor's shares, when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original 
purchase price. The Fund may invest in foreign securities which involve certain currency, credit, interest rate, political 
and economic risks not present in domestic investments.</em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>The Fund is designed for investors whose primary investment objective is growth of capital with a secondary objective of income, 
and who are willing to accept a moderate level of risk in exchange for the higher return potential of equities. It is recommended 
that investors in this Fund not need access to their principal for several years. Since diversification lowers risk of investing 
generally, no one investment should comprise more than 25% of your investment portfolio.</em></font></p>

Fund Profile: Blanchard Precious Metals Fund, Inc.</font> </p>
<p align=center><img src="images/50_new.jpg" alt="Button" align=absmiddle width=50 height=44><a href="sfsgold.htm"><font size=4>Free Gold Market Update</font></a><img src="images/50_new.jpg" alt="Button" align=absmiddle width=50 height=44> </p>
<p align=center><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15> </p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bbirdman2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=50 height=61></font><font size=4><b>Investment Objective:</b> The Blanchard Precious Metal Fund's primary investment objective is to provide long-term growth, 
as well as preservation of purchasing power, by investing in precious metals bullion and precious metals-related equities. </font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15></font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bmaze2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=80 height=62></font><font size=4><b>Investment Strategy:</b> Unlike many precious metals funds, which concentrate their investments in a single precious 
metals market or region of the world, the Blanchard Precious Metals Fund has the flexibility to invest in gold, silver, 
platinum and palladium -- mining stocks and bullion whichever appear most promising. While gold and gold-related 
equities remain the Fund's primary focus, there are many historical instances of silver , platinum and palladium doing 
better than gold during certain phases of the market cycle. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>In addition, the Fund may invest globally, wherever precious metals opportunities are to be found. This flexibility is in sharp 
contrast to those mutual funds which, for example, invest entirely in higher risk South African mining shares; or those which invest 
entirely in North America. The Fund's portfolio manager believes strongly in not putting all of the Fund's &quot;investment eggs&quot; into a 
single basket. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Also, there can be no guarantee that the Fund will meet its objectives. </font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15></font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bmind2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=50 height=63></font><font size=4><b>Manager's Profile:</b> Peter C. Cavelti of Cavelti Capital Management, Ltd., provides portfolio management for the 
Blanchard Precious Metals Fund. From their headquarters in Toronto, Canada, the mining capital of North America, Mr. 
Cavelti scans the globe for attractive precious metals investment opportunities. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Through the auspices of the Blanchard Precious Metals Fund, individual investors can take advantage of their expertise with a 
minimum investment as low as $3,000 ($2,000 for an IRA). </font></p>
<p><font size=4>(Please note: Virtus Capital Management, Inc., an affiliate of Signet Financial Services, Inc., is the Fund's investment advisor.) </font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15></font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bbalance2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=55 height=105></font><font size=4><b>Risk Profile:</b> </font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>As with any precious metals fund, investment return and principal value of the Blanchard Precious Metals Fund will 
vary with changing market conditions so that an investor's shares, when redeemed may be worth more or less than their 
original purchase price.</em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>Because of the higher risk and volatility associated with precious metals then with other investments, this Fund is designed for 
more sophisticated and aggressive investors whose primary investment objective is growth of capital or hedging against 
inflationary times, and who are willing to accept the high risk associated with precious metals investing in exchange for its high 
potential returns. It is recommended that investors in this Fund not need access to their principal for many years. Since 
diversification lowers the risk of investing generally, no one investment should comprise more than 25% of your investment 
portfolio however it is suggested that precious metals comprise only 5-10% of your portfolio.</em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>Naturally, any foreign securities in which the Fund invests entail special currency, credit, political and interest rate risks. </em></font></p>

<em>Please note: As with any precious metals fund, investment return and principal value of the Blanchard Precious 
Metals Fund will vary with changing market conditions so that an investor's shares, when redeemed may be 
worth more or less than their original purchase price. Because of the higher risk and volatility associated with 
precious metals then with other investments, the Fund is designed for more sophisticated and aggressive investors 
whose primary investment objective is growth of capital or hedging against inflationary times, and who are 
willing to accept the high risk associated with precious metals investing in exchange for its high potential returns. 
It is recommended that investors in this Fund not need access to their principal for many years. Since 
diversification lowers the risk of investing generally, no one investment should comprise more than 25% of your 
investment portfolio however it is suggested that precious metals comprise only 5-10% of your portfolio.</em></font></p>

<p align=center><img src="images/investor.gif" alt="Investor" align=bottom hspace=5 width=60 height=40></p>
<p align=center>&#160;</p>
<p><font size=4>The reasons people invest are as different as the people themselves. That's important, because the goal affects the 
plan: the nature of your goal and the time-frame of your investment helps determine the best way to invest. </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size=4>Are you looking for a high rate of return in order to meet your goal? </font></li>
<li><font size=4>What is the time-frame of your investment? Is it something far-off, or something that will be coming up soon? </font></li>
<li><font size=4>What is your &quot;investment personality&quot;? Do temporary ups and downs make you nervous, or do you 
concentrate on long-term performance? </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size=4>In addition, most people have more than one investment goal: for example, investing for a new home and also 
thinking about far-off retirement. Here are just a few possible investment goals: </font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Retirement.</b></font></font><font size=4> What are you looking for in retirement? A comfortable monthly income, a chance to travel, or the 
ability to help out younger relatives? For many, retirement from the &quot;working&quot; world is the chance to embark on a 
life they've always dreamed of: a future bankrolled by savings accumulated previously. </font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>College.</b></font></font><font size=4> Investing for a child's or a young relative's college education is on the minds of many people. Of course, it 
can also mean going back to college (or university, or another more-specialized training program) yourself. </font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Shorter-term goals.</b></font></font><font size=4> Other people have their dreams set on a new home, vacation hideaway, a boat or RV, or the 
cash to start their own business. When your money is working for you for a shorter period of time, you need an 
investment that offers the potential for a more steady rate of return. </font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Estate.</b></font></font><font size=4> Whether you are planning bequests for specific purposes (church, school, another charity) or to provide for 
relatives or friends, careful investment planning is essential to help accomplish your goals and also to avoid paying 
unnecessary taxes. </font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Income Investing.</b></font></font><font size=4> A monthly check that you can use any way you want: for certain everyday expenses, to 
supplement other income, or to help care for a parent or relative. Income investments can be arranged to help 
provide for retirement, or they can begin right now. </font></p>

<p><font size=4>A truly effective investment plan is one you formulate yourself, and then stick to for the time-frame of your 
investment. A plan is a promise you make to yourself, telling you how much you need to invest and where you need 
to put the funds to potentially attain your goal.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=4>To make an investment plan, you need to collect five pieces of information:<br>
</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size=4>Your goal, such as retirement or child's college education. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>Dollar amount of goal. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>Time frame of your investment: how many years until you would like to attain your goal. Some people aim at a 
certain monthly income, such as, &quot;I'd like to retire in 20 years and receive $500/month for the rest of my life.&quot; </font></li>
<li><font size=4>How much the annual rate of return can vary and still let you feel comfortable. Investors who have longer time 
frames can accept short-term fluctuations in exchange for potentially superior long-term returns. Be sure to 
read the section in this Guide about </font><a href="#Comparing Different Investment Options"><font size=4>&quot;Comparing Different Investment Options&quot;.</font></a><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=4>The amount you can put into the plan every month. </font></li>

<p><font size=4>You probably already have an idea of how you want to spend your retirement: relaxing or working a second job, 
traveling or staying close to your home. You may save money on commuting and some other expenses after you 
retire. Likewise, there are some tax advantages and other discounts of which you'll be able to take advantage. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>On the other hand, you may find yourself spending more on leisure activities. . . and medical expenses are likely to 
increase. Many experts recommend a monthly allowance of 60% to 80% of your final salary, but that figure can 
vary, depending on your needs. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Since taxes can eat up a portion of your potential earnings, your plan may include a tax strategy. Some options, 
including IRAs, Keogh and 401(k) plans take pre-tax earnings and let them accumulate tax-deferred until the funds 
are withdrawn, at which time you may be in a lower tax bracket. </font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/graduate.gif" alt="Graduate" align=right hspace=5 width=100 height=81></font><font size=4>In many ways, investing for a child's college education can be one of the most important investments 
you make. In some cases it may pay to set up a separate account, in the child's name, for tax 
purposes. Some options allow parents to shelter certain investments made in their child's name from 
taxes until the child starts college. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>In particular, you may want to investigate opportunities under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act, UGMA (depending 
on your state of residence, it may be the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act, UTMA). Our Investors' Services 
Department has the forms necessary to set up a UGMA or UTMA account. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Whether you're investing to buy your first home or living off the income of prior achievements, the biggest expense 
to take into consideration is the IRS. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Depending on your tax bracket and the time-frame of your investment, tax-advantaged investing may offer significant 
advantages to you over regular investments. </font></p>

<p><font size=4>Literally, a share of stock is part ownership in a corporation. When you invest in stock, you're tying your financial 
future to the ups and downs of a real company: how well it can sell its products, how it manages its employees, and 
how well-run an organization it can be.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>Who sets the price for a share of stock? The marketplace. Stocks sell for whatever people will pay for them: a figure 
that changes minute-by-minute on fast-paced exchange floors. The real price is determined by the expectations of 
other investors. Will the company have a good year? Is there a new product ready to be introduced? Is another 
company interested in acquiring its stock? </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Anything that makes people anxious to buy your stock back from you later makes that stock a good buy today: and 
it will be priced accordingly. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Similarly, anything (including annual reports, reports of professional stock analysts and brokerage houses, news 
reports, and sometimes rumors) that might make the stock less attractive in the future will hurt its price today. </font></p>
<table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5 width=600 COLSPEC="L20">
<tr><td width=400><font size=4>In fact, these expectations themselves influence the 
price of the stock. When enough investors think a 
stock is a good buy, the sudden rush of investors 
buying the stock will cause the price to rise. (The 
price you will pay for a stock will also be 
influenced by the commission you have to pay: a 
fact worth remembering before you start on an 
investing plan that includes buying and selling 
multiple stocks.) </font><p><font size=4>Unless you're an expert in a particular industry, it's 
best to diversify your portfolio (a portfolio is your 
selection of investments). That might mean having 
an equal investment in both Ford and General 
Motors. That way, even when one stock goes 
down, the other may stay up and work to balance 
out the loss. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Most experts feel you should take diversification a 
step further. That's because, in many cases, whole 
market categories (like all automotives or all health 
care firms) tend to move together. So, your 
selection of stocks should include a broad range of 
companies in many different categories. In that 
way, your portfolio will better track the stock 
market as a whole. </font></p>
</td><td width=200><font size=4><em><strong>Are mutual funds a 
more convenient 
alternative for you? </strong></em></font><p><font size=4><em><strong>If selecting a balanced 
portfolio of promising 
stocks sounds difficult, 
take heart: there's a 
simple answer. Mutual 
funds, described more 
fully in the next 
chapter, let 
professionals pick out 
stocks for you. What's 
more, mutual funds 
offer diversification 
among securities, 
which helps insulate 
you from management 
problems (which you 
might not have 
foreseen) within a 
single company. </strong></em></font></p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p><font size=4>By the way, you've probably heard of different exchanges: the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock 
Exchange (AMEX), and the National Association of Security Dealers, Automated Quotations (NASDAQ). These 
are different trading groups that exist to buy and sell stocks (a given stock is only traded at a single exchange). Your 
portfolio can be made up of stocks from any number of exchanges or it can include stock mutual funds. </font></p>
<table border=5 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5 COLSPEC="L20">
<tr><td><font size=4><em><strong>Blue Chips vs. Growth</strong></em> </font><p><font size=4>Blue chips are common stocks of well known companies with histories of profit growth &amp; dividends. They are 
usually high-priced and low-yielding. Growth stocks are companies that have experienced fast gains in earnings 
over the past few years and are expected to keep showing signs of growth. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Under certain market conditions, blue chips and growth stocks could respond differently to different market 
forces. For example, it may be that growth stocks are rising in value while blue chips are staying at the same 
average price (the opposite could also be true). </font></p>

<p><font size=4>Though not as well-understood, the bond market is many times larger than the stock market in terms of total dollars 
invested. Bonds are IOU's: promises to pay back a certain amount of money, plus interest, on a certain date. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Many bonds pay interest on a regular basis (often quarterly). That means you could get a steady, fixed income for 
as long as you hold the bond: an attractive option for someone who intends to use an investment for living expenses. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>While only corporations can issue stock, both corporations and municipalities, as well as the Federal government 
and its agencies, can issue bonds. You'll find bonds issued by the largest corporations (like Boeing and AT&amp;T), 
public utilities, and municipal governments (states, cities, and local taxing bodies such as airports and tollways). </font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/munbnds.gif" align=right hspace=10 width=60 height=54></font><font size=4>Issuing municipal bonds is one way many public projects are financed. For example, a school district 
can sell bonds to build a new school, then pay it back with taxes. They might increase the tax rate slightly 
to pay for the bonds and the interest, but that's much easier for taxpayers to swallow than paying for the 
entire sum in a single year. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>The Federal government cooperates with this financing in a very special way: they don't tax the interest income 
investors receive from municipal bonds. Interest income on corporate bonds, by comparison, is taxed as regular 
income. That may make municipal bonds an attractive investment for those in the higher tax brackets. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>In addition, individual states don't tax income from bonds issued within that state (eg., Virginia doesn't tax bonds 
issued by municipalities within Virginia). Mutual funds made up of municipal bonds from a single state may help you 
to avoid both Federal and state income taxes! </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Please note: capital gains earned by a municipal bond fund are taxable at the state and Federal level. Income may be 
subject to state and local taxes. In addition, some taxpayers may be subject to a Federal Alternative Minimum Tax. </font></p>
<table border=5 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5 COLSPEC="L20">
<tr><td><font size=4><em><strong>Taxable vs. Tax-Free Investing</strong></em> </font><p><font size=4>Of course, no one wants to pay more taxes than necessary. But a taxable investment may offer a higher interest 
rate (assuming both have the same maturity and similar risk of default). So, which one is better for you? </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Remember, it's the money you keep after taxes that counts! After you pay taxes on the interest income, the net 
amount you earn may not be that much less than that of a tax-free investment. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>The best choice for you depends on how your tax advisor has set up your personal finances, including your 
estate, and what your future tax liabilities might be. Certainly, there is no need to use tax-free investments in an 
account that is tax-sheltered to begin with (such as a retirement account), or if the investor is in a special tax 
category (such as a child's college investment set up under UGMA/UTMA). </font></p>

<p><font size=3><em>Choosing the right investment means noting your own tax bracket, then comparing potential tax-free rates of return with potential 
returns expected from taxable investments.</em></font><font size=5> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>* Rates of return are hypothetical, and are not indicative of the performance of any particular investment. This chart does not assume taxes or 
penalties that would be imposed for early withdrawal from tax-deferred retirement funds. Capital gains (if any) are not included. Yield and 
principal value of mutual funds will fluctuate.</font><font size=4><br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=4>Whether they are tax-free or not, all bonds have three main components: </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Par Value</b></font></font><font size=4>: The amount that will be repaid to the bondholder when the loan is over. Typically, bonds have a 
par value of $1,000. </font></li>
<li><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Coupon (Interest) Rate</b></font></font><font size=4>: The percentage of the par value paid each year in interest to the bondholder. </font></li>
<li><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Maturity</b></font></font><font size=4>: The date on which the loan ends (&quot;is retired&quot;). You can buy bonds that mature anywhere from one 
year to thirty years from now. (A bond that matures in less than one year is called a &quot;bill.&quot;) Some bonds can be 
&quot;called.&quot; That means that the bond issuer can pay the principal plus the interest-to-date, then cancel the rest of 
the interest that would have been paid had the loan not been called before the expected maturity date. Other 
bonds cannot be called; you'll continue to collect interest as scheduled until maturity. </font></li>
</ul>
<table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5 width=600 COLSPEC="L20">
<tr><td width=200><font size=4><b><i>Confused? Consider a 
bond mutual fund. 
You could enjoy a 
steady stream of 
income (and, for some 
funds, the tax-free 
benefits), with the 
simplicity of investing 
common to mutual 
funds. Unlike 
individual bonds, 
mutual funds do not 
pay fixed rates of 
return. </i></b></font></td><td width=400><font size=4>In addition, bonds can be bought or sold before 
the maturity date. What's the selling price for a 
bond that is traded on the market? Like stocks, the 
price is whatever a buyer will pay. The main 
influences on bond prices are the interest rate and 
maturity (is the interest rate the bond is paying 
higher or lower than other bonds for the same time 
period?) and the likelihood of default (default is 
when the bond issuer is financially unable to pay 
the interest or even the par value for a bond). </font></td></tr>
</table>
<p><font size=4>In general, when interest rates rise, the price of existing bonds will fall. That's because investors can find other 
investments that offer a higher rate of return than the coupon rate of the existing bond. On the other hand, when 
interest rates fall, a bond that promises to pay a coupon rate that is higher than the current market rate is an attractive 
investment. Consequently, investors may be willing to pay more than the par value for the bond. </font></p>
<table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5 width=600 COLSPEC="L20">
<tr><td width=400><font size=4>Since bond prices can vary over the life of the 
bond, the price you pay for a bond may be more or 
less than the par value. But, the interest rate that the 
bond pays is still based on the par value. For a 
more accurate picture of their income, investors 
usually refer to current yield: the interest paid as a 
percentage of the price they actually paid for a 
bond. </font></td><td width=200><font size=4><b><i>Purchase Price is not 
Par Value. </i></b></font><p><font size=4><b><i>Interest Rate is not 
Yield. </i></b></font></p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p><font size=4>In addition, you may buy a bond at a low price, then sell it later at a higher price. The amount you earn is the interest 
paid over the time period you held the bond plus the price increase (capital gain). Likewise, if you sell a bond at a 
lower price than what you originally paid, you will realize a loss. The interest plus the capital gain (loss) is the total 
return for the time period. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Finally, brokers who sell bonds have a special fee structure that adds to the price of a bond. </font></p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><font size=4>You can make a life's work of following the stock market and other financial 
markets, or you can let an expert invest your money for you. Many investors 
look to the experts through mutual funds. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>A mutual fund is a large selection of securities purchased by a pool of investors 
and managed for the investors by a professional investment manager. A mutual 
fund may consist of thousands of shares of stock, worth billions of dollars. 
Who actually owns the fund? The investors own shares of the fund, but actual 
buy and sell decisions concerning securities held by the fund are made by the 
investment manager or &quot;advisor.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size=4>The Fund Manager constantly reviews the securities held by the fund, and can 
change the securities as market conditions change. All mutual funds have stated 
investment goals and identify the types of securities that will be used to seek to 
achieve the objective, as well as the things the fund manager will be looking for 
in making investment decisions. These goals are stated in the fund's prospectus, 
an important piece of reading for anyone serious about mutual funds. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>You can participate in mutual funds that invest in, among other things, small 
companies, large companies, bonds, and Treasury bills. Some offer greater risk 
and greater income or growth potential; others are for more conservative 
investors. There are also tax-free funds that invest in municipal bonds, including 
those that invest in tax-free bonds from a single state. You can find a mutual 
fund to match almost any investment objective. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Mutual fund investing offers several advantages over investing in individual 
securities. </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Diversification.</b></font></font><font size=4> Since a mutual fund is made up of a wide variety of 
different securities, it is automatically diversified within a given category. </font></li>
<li><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Commission.</b></font></font><font size=4> Usually when you buy or sell stocks or bonds, you pay a 
broker a commission for completing the transaction for you. For small 
investors, commissions can be substantial. Very large institutional 
investors, such as mutual funds, pay the lowest commission rate, a savings 
that may be passed on to fund investors. (Although you may save on 
commissions, you will pay other fees for mutual fund investing. See 
individual prospectuses for a fee structure. See note on &quot;loads&quot; below.) </font></li>
<li><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Liquidity.</b></font></font><font size=4> Open-end mutual fund shares can be bought or sold at any time 
at their current net asset value (plus commission, sometimes). There is no 
problem of finding a buyer for a security, or waiting until a trade clears or 
a bond matures. Some funds offer limited check access. </font></li>
<li><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Professional management.</b></font></font><font size=4> Mutual funds employ a staff of highly-trained 
analysts to follow industry news, track the creditworthiness of bond 
issuers, and make predictions on interest rate futures. Few individual 
investors can match their expertise. </font></li>
<li><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Recordkeeping.</b></font></font><font size=4> When you have a mutual fund, you receive a regular 
statement (usually quarterly or every month in which you make a 
transaction) that shows the total value of your investment, and recent 
changes. Also, you receive a statement at the end of the year that makes 
tax preparation simpler. </font></li>
</ul>
<table border=5 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5 COLSPEC="L20">
<tr><td><font size=5><em><strong>Load or No-Load</strong></em></font><font size=4> </font><p><font size=4>If you purchase a mutual fund through a broker, you may pay a special 
commission, called a &quot;load.&quot; There are three types of loads: </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Front-end load.</b></font></font><font size=4> The commission is paid at the time you purchase 
shares of the fund; that is, the amount is deducted from the money that 
is actually invested. </font></li>
<li><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Back-end load.</b></font></font><font size=4> In this case, the commission is deducted from the 
money you receive when shares are redeemed. If the shares have 
decreased in value from when you purchased them, the load will be less 
than if you paid it at the time you first invested your money. For funds 
with back-end loads, you pay a back-end load only if you redeem 
shares within a fixed period of time; after that time, you may redeem 
shares without paying a load. </font></li>
<li><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Level load.</b></font></font><font size=4> A percentage of the value of your investment is deducted 
annually. For some mutual funds, the level load is deducted for a fixed 
period of time; after that, there is no load. </font></li>
<li><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>No load.</b></font></font><font size=4> You pay no sales commission when you invest in a no-load 
fund. However, as these funds are generally made available directly to 
investors through the mail, you may pay a special fee to help market and 
promote a no-load fund. This fee, named after an SEC rule, is called a 
12b(1) fee, and you'll find it described in the fund's prospectus. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size=4>In addition, shareholders in all types of mutual funds (load and no-load) pay 
fees for the management and administration of the fund. You'll find these 
management fees and fund expenses described in the prospectus. </font></p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p><font size=4>If you own individual stocks, or if your mutual fund is listed, you'll probably 
want to follow your investment in your daily newspaper. However, TV and 
radio news programs usually don't list individual stocks; instead, they give some 
of the common stock indexes. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Indexes are averages of many stocks, and provide a good indication of the ups 
and downs of the stock market in general. That's because, as noted before, 
stocks frequently move in tandem with one another: when one goes up, many 
go up. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>But over the long term, different kinds of companies will have different price 
changes. For this reason, you should make sure you're following the index that 
most closely tracks your investments. </font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>The Dow Jones Industrial Average.</b></font></font><font size=4> This index is more than 100 years old 
(even older than the newspaper it spawned, The Wall Street Journal). It 
represents the prices of 30 actively-traded blue chip stocks on the New York 
Stock Exchange. The 30 different companies are changed periodically to typify 
products important to the U.S. economy. Current selections (as of November, 
1995) include McDonald's, General Motors and Proctor &amp; Gamble. Since the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average is made up of larger companies, it doesn't 
accurately indicate the trends affecting small company stocks. </font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><font size=4><b>Standard &amp; Poor's Composite Index of 500 Stocks (S&amp;P 500).</b></font></font><font size=4> This index 
uses a complex formula to track 500 stocks traded on the New York and the 
American stock exchanges. It isn't a simple average of the stock prices. Each 
price is weighted depending on how actively it was traded. While this weighting 
gives considerable emphasis to the stocks of larger companies, it also measures 
the performance of many smaller stocks. </font></p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><font size=4>So, which investment vehicle is for you? A mutual fund that invests in stocks, bonds, or Treasury bills, or 
something else? </font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/sfs_ch7.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 width=150 height=143></font><font size=4>The answer depends on your investment goal, and the type of investor you are. That's 
because different investments let you participate in the market at different points on the 
risk/reward line. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Since consideration of risk is an important element in putting together the right portfolio, it's 
worth taking a close look at how the different investment vehicles have performed over time. </font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/sfs_ch6.gif" align=right hspace=10 width=250 height=163></font><font size=4>Although past performance is no guarantee of future 
results, the chart to the right* shows the growth of a dollar invested in different 
investment vehicles over the last 69 years. Average values for each investment 
category were taken. It's the amount you would have earned if you would have 
reinvested all dividends (for stocks) and coupons (for bonds), and does not 
take taxes into consideration. Transaction costs are not included, except in the 
small stock index starting in 1982. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>The first thing to look at is where that single dollar ended up. If you'd invested in stocks from smaller companies, 
you could have ended up with $2,842.77 in 1994. That corresponds to an annualized total return of 12.2%. Of 
course, some years small company stocks showed great gains, and other years they showed small gains and even 
losses. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Long-term government bonds, on the other hand, were much more consistent performers: they didn't wind up as 
high as stocks, but they didn't show the same ups and downs year by year. Treasury bills, considered nearly 
risk-free, were the steadiest of all. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>When you look at charts of indices, it's important to remember that they're an average of ALL securities in a given 
category: not any particular security or any particular mutual fund. Indices are unmanaged, and investments may not 
be made in an index. And past performance does not guarantee future results. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Note: Unlike stocks, Treasury bills and Government bonds are guaranteed as to the timely payment of interest and 
principal by the U.S. Government. Unlike T-bills, stocks and bonds fluctuate in value. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>It's this range of ups and downs that investors are talking about when they say a given investment has &quot;risk.&quot; Here is 
another way of looking at the way different investments performed one year at a time. </font></p>

<table border=5 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5 COLSPEC="L20">
<tr><td><font size=4><strong>Chart 8*:</strong>The bars show the range of one-year total returns (in percent)for the same investments: that's the 
greatest amount an investor could have made (or lost) in a single year. As you can see, stocks showed the 
greatest swings, and Treasury bills the smallest. </font></td></tr>
</table>
<p><font size=4><em>Range of one-year total returns (losses) for different investments. The average annualized return for the 69-year 
period is highlighted.</em> </font></p>
<p><font size=4>But to see what really might happen to your investment, you've got to remember that most investors hold on to their 
money for more than just one year. Look what happens to investors who kept a volatile investment for a short 
period of time*.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size=4>What if an investor had held on to small stocks for five, ten, or twenty years? As the other bars in </font><a href="#Chart 9"><font size=4>Chart 9</font></a><font size=4> indicate, 
volatility goes down the longer a given security is held. In fact, market swings have tended to cancel one another out 
within a fairly short period. As a result, the range of annual returns for longer time periods compares with the 
one-year returns of less volatile investments, such as Treasury bills. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>That's important, because the average annual return (shown by the line in </font><a href="#Chart 8"><font size=4>Chart 8</font></a><font size=4> and the higher end points in </font><a href="#Chart 7"><font size=4>Chart 
7</font></a><font size=4>) for stocks has been much higher than for those that have less year-to-year swings. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Of course, there's no telling what the future may bring. But historical data does suggest that a longer holding period 
can help offset market volatility. </font></p>

<p align=center><a name="Diversification and Asset Allocation"><font color="#000080"><font size=5><b>Diversification and Asset Allocation</b></font></font></a><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Whether your time frame is long or short, you can further limit the effect of risk on your investment by diversifying 
your portfolio. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>To get an idea of diversification, think of the old saying, &quot;Never put all your eggs in one basket.&quot; Diversification 
seeks to limit the potential negative impact of any one part of your portfolio by balancing it with other securities that 
might not be affected by the same market forces. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>As was mentioned earlier, mutual funds are excellent vehicles for diversification because they invest in a variety of 
different securities. When you invest in a stock mutual fund, for example, you get the risk and reward potential of a 
number of different stocks, so a loss in one issue can be offset or be reduced by a gain in another. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>However, market forces may affect many stocks at the same time. In this case, it helps to have taken diversification 
a step further, by dividing your portfolio among different types of mutual funds. By investing in an assortment of 
funds which invest primarily or exclusively in different asset classes: say, bonds or Treasury bills: you get double the 
diversification. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Deciding which classes to invest in, and how much of your portfolio to put in each class, is referred to as asset 
allocation. Many investment analysts and financial planners recommend an asset allocation that matches your 
particular investment goal, the time frame of your investment, and the risk/growth potential you feel comfortable 
with. </font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/sfs_ch10.gif" align=left hspace=10 width=150 height=106></font><font size=4>For example, if you are willing to take on some price fluctuation risk in return for maximum 
capital potential growth, you might choose an asset allocation that emphasizes stocks but 
seeks to balance their volatility with short-term bonds. A portion of your portfolio will be 
reserved for a money-market fund, liquid capital that can be kept for emergencies. </font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/sfs_ch11.gif" align=right hspace=0 width=150 height=106></font><font size=4>At the same time, if you were looking for a more conservative investment 
that offered less risk and supplemented current income, you might require an asset allocation 
that looks like the chart to the right: </font></p>
<p><font size=4><i>* These portfolios are provided as an example only.</i> </font></p>
<p><font size=4><br>
It's important to remember that diversification and asset allocation isn't a one-time exercise, it's an ongoing process. 
As your age and situation change: marriage, children, retirement: so should your mix of investments. </font></p>

<p><font size=4>There's a real threat to your longer-term investing, and it is INFLATION. Think of inflation as the amount that prices 
go up over the term of your investment: so what if you have more dollars, but everything costs more! </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Actually, inflation is a measure of the buying power of the dollar. In Chart 6 (on page 14), inflation was the bottom 
line undermining all the other lines. Because of inflation, it cost $8.35 in 1994 to buy something that cost only $1.00 
in 1926. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>If your investment can't keep pace with inflation, you could find that you've actually lost part of your investment 
because of the decline in purchasing power. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Inflation has been a real threat to investors who have sought the most conservative investments. Again, go back to 
Chart 6 (on page 14). Look how closely the Treasury bills line tracks the inflation line. In fact, for investments held 
five years, Treasury bills outpaced inflation only a little more than half the time. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>If you're likely to keep your money invested for five years or more, it is wise to look at the growth potential of an 
investment as well as its volatility. </font></p>

<center><h2>Signet Banking Corporation 1994 Year-end Earnings<br>(excluding Capital One)</h2>

<b><a href=#finsum>Financial Summary</b></a>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n February 28, 1995, Signet Banking Corporation ("Signet") spun off Capital

One Financial Corporation ("Capital One"). The financial summary below portrays

Signet's financial position and the results of operations for the periods

presented excluding Capital One ("Signet Bank"). Amounts related to Capital One

were subtracted from the Signet totals and were computed as follows: actual

interest income, an allocation for funding (interest expense) when Capital One

operated as a division of Signet Bank/Virginia (prior to November 22, 1994) and

actual interest expense for the period thereafter, and actual non-interest

income and expense. Overhead expenses, allocable to Capital One prior to

November 22, 1994, were not subtracted since the major portion of these

predominantly fixed expenses remain with Signet Bank. These expenses were added

to non-interest income to reflect the intercompany allocation between Signet

Bank and Capital One.<p>

The net income for the year ended December 31, 1994 is not indicative of the

expected results for 1995. Signet Bank's 1994 earnings reflect the impact of

restructuring charges that were taken as a result of a comprehensive

improvement plan aimed at reducing expenses and increasing revenues to enhance

Signet's competitive position. Signet is already beginning to reap the benefits

of these actions. For an in-depth discussion of the comprehensive Signet Bank

improvement plan refer to <a href="newsig.htm"> <b>Creating the New Signet.</b></a><p>

<font size=6>Fund Profile: Blanchard Short-Term Flexible Income Fund</font> </p>
<p align=center><img src="images/morn5star.gif" align=bottom width=104 height=26><br>
<strong>Morningstar overall rating out of 1,104 taxable bond funds for 3 years ending 12/31/96.</strong></p>
<p align=center>Based on historical risk-adjusted performance and subject to change each month.<br>
(See Performance Update below for a more complete explanation.)</p>
<p align=center><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15> </p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bbirdman2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=50 height=61></font><font size=4><b>Investment Objective:</b> The Blanchard Short-Term Flexible Income Fund's primary investment objective is to provide 
investors with a high level of current income, coupled with the historically low volatility of short-term investment grade 
bonds. </font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15></font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bmaze2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=80 height=62></font><font size=4><b>Investment Strategy:</b> Unlike some bond mutual funds which are locked into a single sector of the bond market, the 
Blanchard Short-Term Flexible Income Fund has the common-sense ability to seek promising yields wherever and 
whenever they are to be found. As such, it can invest in -- and switch between -- U.S. Treasuries, high-quality 
corporate, asset backed, high yield/high risk, and even foreign bonds, as dictated by prevailing market conditions. This 
diversification is intended to potentially enhance yield while reducing overall risk and volatility. The Fund is designed for 
conservative investors for whom current income, and not growth of principal, is a primary investment objective. Since 
diversification lowers the risk of investing generally, no one investment should comprise more than 25% of your investment 
portfolio.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>In addition, the Fund seeks a high degree of share price stability by keeping its average portfolio maturity short (generally 3 years or 
less). Historically, short-term securities offer far greater stability and are less likely to be hurt by interest rate increases than 
higher-yielding longer term bonds.Naturally, there can be no guarantee that the Fund will meet its objectives. </font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15></font></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bmind2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=50 height=63></font><font size=4><b>Manager's Profile:</b> The Fund's chief portfolio manager is Jack Burks, managing director of OFFITBANK of New York, 
one of America's most prestigious independent trust banks with over $6 billion in assets under management. OFFITBANK 
specializes in the management of customized fixed income portfolios for a sophisticated clientele made up of wealthy family 
groups, corporations, and non-profit organizations. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>OFFITBANK's minimum account size for individually managed accounts is usually $10 million. However, through the auspices of 
the Blanchard Short-Term Flexible Income Fund, individual investors can take advantage of their expertise with a minimum 
investment as low as $3,000 ($2,000 for an IRA). </font></p>
<p><font size=4>(Please note: Virtus Capital Management, Inc., an affiliate of Signet Financial Services, Inc., is the Fund's investment advisor.) </font></p>

<p><font size=4>Average Portfolio Maturity: 2.13 years (Source: OFFITBANK, as of 12/31/96) </font></p>
<p><font size=4><i>As with any fixed income fund, investment return, yield and principal value of the Blanchard Short-Term Flexible Income Fund 
will vary with changing market conditions so that an investor's shares, when redeemed may be worth more or less than their 
original purchase price. Also, any foreign securities in which the Fund invests entail special currency, credit, political and 
interest rate risks. The Fund may also invest in high yield/higher risk bonds which involve greater price volatility than higher 
rated bonds.</i></font></p>

Morningstar overall rating out of 1,104 fixed income funds for 3 years ending 12/31/96.^            

^Morningstar proprietary ratings reflect historical risk-adjusted performance as
of 12/31/96. The ratings are subject to change every month. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Morningstar ratings are calculated from the Fund's 3-year
average annual returns with appropriate fee adjustments in excess of 90-day Treasury bill
returns,and a risk factor that reflects fund performance below 90-day T-bill returns. The
one-year rating is calculated using the same methodology, but is not a component of the overall
rating. For the 1-year period,the Blanchard Short-Term Flexible Income Fund was rated 4 stars
among 1,670 fixed income funds. 10% of the funds in an investment category receive 5 stars,
the next 22.5% receive 4 stars. </font></pre>

<p align=center>&#160;</p>
<p align=center><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15> </p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bbirdman2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=50 height=61></font><font size=4><b>Investment Objective:</b> The Blanchard Flexible Income Fund's primary investment objective is to provide investors with a 
high current income. A secondary objective is to seek capital appreciation over time. </font></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p align=center><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" align=bottom width=474 height=15></p>
<p><font size=4><img src="images/bmaze2.gif" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 width=80 height=62></font><font size=4><b>Investment Strategy:</b> Unlike many bond funds, which concentrate their investment in a single fixed income market, 
and then are subject to the rise and fall of that single market, the Blanchard Flexible Income Fund has the freedom to 
invest in virtually any and all of the major fixed income markets. The Fund seeks to enhance yield while lowering risk by 
diversifying its portfolio across a variety of fixed income markets, and then adjusting its portfolio blend according to the 
prevailing economic climate. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>This flexibility enables the Fund's manager to invest in those fixed income markets which currently offer the highest yields and the 
greatest potential for capital appreciation -- or which are most effective in reducing the overall risk of the portfolio. Depending on 
the prevailing market conditions, the Fund may invest in U.S. Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, investment grade corporate, 
foreign and high yield/higher risk bonds. As importantly, the Fund also has the ability to shorten or lengthen its portfolio in an 
attempt to reduce risk or enhance yield. Naturally, there can be no guarantee that the Fund will meet its objectives. </font></p>

purchase price. The Fund is designed for investors whose investment objective is current income and growth of capital and who 
are willing to accept a moderate level of market risk and volatility. It is recommended that investors in this Fund not need access 
to their principal for several years. Since diversification lowers the risk of investing generally, no one investment should comprise 
more than 25% of your investment portfolio. Also, any foreign securities in which the Fund invests entail special currency, credit,

The US dollar is stable this morning in quiet dealings. For the first time in
a week, the US dollar is not opening at sharply higher levels than the day
before. There is no major US economic data due out today. Earlier, in Germany,
the German Bundesbank kept key German interest rates unchanged. The
pause in the US dollar's upward momentum may have been caused
by comments from one Bundesbank official to the effect that the US
dollar's ascent may need to slow down. This is the first time that
a Bundesbank official has expressed anything less than full support
for the US dollar's strength.

<IMG SRC="http://www.signet.com/mc/images/fxlogo1.jpg" ALIGN=left><H1><FONT Color=#800040>THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET</FONT></H1>
<BR>
<HR>
<H4>In today's global economy, a company cannot afford to overlook
the importance of foreign exchange. Unpredictable
market movements, unexplained services fees, lengthy processing
times and inattention to service have perpetuated the myth that
foreign exchange is difficult to manage. Signet's foreign exchange
traders work with each customer to develop specific programs to
meet individual needs and make the process as simple as possible.
While Signet's services can help alleviate the unnecessary fees
and delays, it is our understanding of the foreign exchange marketplace
that helps our clientele cope with and prepare for unpredictable
movements.</H4>

<H4>The foreign exchange market is unlike any other market in
the world because of the sheer number of factors that can have
an impact on exchange rates.</H4>

<H4>The chart below shows the long-term decline in the value of
the US dollar versus the Japanese yen. Some analysts suggest that
this decline is the product of the prolonged US budget and trade
deficits, while others suggest that the US currency is the victim
of its own role in the world as a reserve currency. With so many
US dollars circulating, there will always be an abundant supply
of the currency on world markets while other currencies may be
subject to changes in availability.</H4>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="http://www.signet.com/mc/images/chart.gif" WIDTH=434 HEIGHT=214 ALIGN=middle>
</CENTER>
<P>

<H4>The chart also shows that the US dollar does have upward potential
during various periods. These movements are often caused by other
cyclical factors such as the pace of growth in the United States
and world economies, inflation and other political factors.</H4>

<H4>Then there are short-term, day-to-day movements that can fluctuate
several percent per day. These unpredictable movements often completely
surprise market participants and frequently correspond to erratic
investment and speculative flows.</H4>

<H4>A final factor is the variance in rates of exchange charged
by different foreign exchange suppliers. The different rates often
represent the ability or inability to effectively participate
in the foreign exchange market, personal opinions of market levels
or timeliness of market movement and updates.</H4>

<H4>All of these elements combine ot make the foreign exchange
markets volatile. Just as your business cannot ignore the opportunities
in global markets, you cannot ignore the factors affecting global
exchange rates. Let Signet Bank help you manage your foreign exchange
needs and mitigate the risks inherent in currency markets.</H4>

<HR>
<H4>The Signet Bank Foreign Exchange Department recognizes that
by appropriately matching our services and capabilities to your
needs, we can more effectively eliminate foreign exchange risk
from your operations. One simple way to use our expertise is to
inform the traders of your buying patterns, frequency, and desired
levels. We stay alert to the specific issues that apply to the
currencies that interest you and your business. This allows us
to tailor our services to your needs. For example:</H4>

<H4>One of our customers recently received a call from a Signet
foreign exchange trader alerting them that the US dollar had rallied
by nearly 1.5%. The customer took advantage of this unusually
large move and was able to lock in an advantageous rate of exchange.
Signet Bank has invested in the latest technology to keep track
of market activity. In addition to alerting our clients of crucial
market movements, we can help you better understand the forces
at work in the foreign exchange market.</H4>

<IMG SRC="http://www.signet.com/mc/images/flags.gif" WIDTH=276 HEIGHT=185 ALIGN=right>
<H4>Another of our clients recently placed an overnight order
to buy Canadian dollars if it reached a specified level. The level
was reached, the order was completed, and the customer's exposure
to a depreciating US dollar was eliminated. Signet Bank's Foreign
Exchange Department has enhanced the effectiveness of standard
spot, forward and option transactions by allowing its clients
to get 24-hour coverage of their foreign exchange exposure. In
essence, Signet Bank can target specific foreign exchange levels
through its correspondent network by placing stop-loss or take-profit
orders. By placing such orders, a company can set targets that
may be met while the US market is dormant.</H4>

<H4>Finally, according to published reports, in early 1991, the
Japanese government pledged nearly 1.2 trillion yen to the United
States to help defray the cost of the Desert Storm operation.
Several months later, when the funds were actually received by
the Federal Government, the market had moved. Having failed to
lock in a rate of exchange in the foreign exchange market, the
Federal Government was faced with a loss of nearly $400 million.
While this is an extreme example of the dangers of not hedging
foreign exchange exposure, it points out the need to use the tools
available. Had the Federal Government bought a forward contract,
there would not have been a loss. Signet Bank's Foreign Exchange
Department offers these products to its customers, helping them
avoid such unfortunate losses.</H4>

<H4>We encourage our customers to use our services, not just for
their basic utility, but also for enhancing the way they do business.

<H4><FONT Color=#800040>Spot Transactions</FONT> are the purchase or sale of currency
at a fixed rate of exchange for delivery within two business days
following the trade date. Spot transactions help you meet your
immediate foreign exchange requirements.</H4>

<H4><FONT Color=#800040>Forward Transactions</FONT> are the purchase or sale of currency
for delivery in the future, typically three business days to one
year from the trade date. The price is agreed upon on the date
of the trade. This assures the customer of actual cost or profit
involved in a transaction because of the value of the future payable
or receivable is locked in at the trade date. Forward contracts
are the most widely used instrument to eliminate currency risk.
</H4>

<H4><FONT Color=#800040>Maturity Windows</FONT> are the purchase or sale of currency
at a fixed rate of exchange for settlement on an unspecified date
that falls within a predetermined range of days. The window period
usually runs from, but is not limited to, 10 to 20 days, and the
customer decides which day the contract will be exercised within
that period of time. This type of contract can add value when
there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the actual date
of settlement (called the valued date in foreign exchange markets).
</H4>

<H4><FONT Color=#800040>Foreign Currency Option Transactions</FONT> require a payment
of premium and give the buyer the right, but not the obligation,
to buy or sell foreign currency on a future date at a preset
price. This instrument is recommended for hedging currency risk
when there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the actual
need for the currency.</H4>

<H4><FONT Color=#800040>Foreign Currency Suspense Accounts</FONT> can be used to hold
small amounts of funds purchased by clients. Many clients use
this facility to purchase currencies at advantageous rates for
future use. Although the account does not pay interest, it does
allow the client to purchase blocks of currency to be held until
a specific payment needs to be made.</H4>

<H4><FONT Color=#800040>Foreign Currency Certificates of Deposit</FONT> are available
in several currencies. While these funds are not as readily available
as those in a suspense account, they do earn market interest rates
and can be used to meed a client's margin requirements.</H4>

<HR>
<H4>Signet Bank has developed a number of international cash management
services designed to help speed a company's access to its foreign
receivables and ensure proper information flow for updating customer
records. Payments received in a foreign currency check or wire
are converted to US dollars and credited to the customer's Signet
account quickly. Customers are advised of all conversion rates
and fees, if any.</H4>

<H4><FONT Color=#800040>Canadian Lockbox:</FONT> In 1994, Signet introduced the Canadian
Lockbox service for organizations receiving dues or other payments
from Canada. The image-enabled lockbox system in Toronto reduces
mail time by 8-14 days. Payments in US dollars or Canadian dollars
are processed and credited to a corporate account in the customer's
name at The Bank of Montreal. All Canadian funds can be automatically
converted to US dollars and transferred into the customer's main
<IMG SRC="http://www.signet.com/mc/images/check.gif" WIDTH=276 HEIGHT=185 ALIGN=right>
account at Signet Bank the next business day. An electronic transmission
of payment information can be generated each afternoon/evening
to update receivable files. Actual documents will be forwarded
to the company after the information is processed and the monies
deposited.</H4>


<H4><FONT Color=#800040>Foreign Check Processing:</FONT> More than 5,000 foreign checks
are processed through Signet's Foreign Cash Letter Program each
month. Funds on most items are available the next day. After depositing
foreign checks at any Signet branch, customers receive a detailed
statement showing the maker of the check, amount in foreign currency
and US dollars, and any fees associated with the clearing process.
All checks are image archived prior to processing, so customers
can have quick and easy access if an actual copy of the check

<H4>Signet's Foreign Exchange Department offers foreign drafts
drawn on major banks in over 40 currencies and wires in over 75
currencies. In addition, we currently offer US dollar drafts drawn
on banks in 35 countries. Drafts and wires can be handled through
a Signet branch office, through a Signet commercial account officer,
or by faxing directly to Signet's Foreign Exchange Department.
</H4>

<H4>For customers that require a larger number of foreign drafts
or wires each month, Signet's Foreign Exchange Department can
install a PC-based product in the customer's office to facilitate
foreign exchange work.</H4>

<H4><FONT Color=#800040>MicroExchange<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP></FONT>. This highly flexible system is an attractive
option for customers who require a number of foreign remittances
each month. MicroExchange<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP> is a PC-based draft and wire system
that resides in a customer's office. It allows an organization
to download rates from Signet each morning, produce drafts on-site,
and initiate foreign wires. The transmission of end-of-day data
back to Signet authorizes payment of the drafts and wires and
creates a debit to the customer's demand deposit account at Signet.
MicroExchange<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP> maintains a comprehensive historical database of
reports that can be sorted by a variety of criteria. There is
also a feature for repetitive payment information that streamlines
the input process and reduces the potential for errors. The system
has a rigorous yet flexible security system including various
levels of password protection, encrypted files and automatic sign-off.
MicroExchange<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP> is an automated cost effective option for foreign
draft processing that allows an organization to retain control
over its foreign drafts and wire transfers.</H4>

</H1>
<HR>
<H4>Establishing a trading relationship with the Signet Bank Foreign
Exchange Department is easy and straightforward. We offer the
ability to trade under three payment scenarios that allow you
to choose one suitable to your needs.</H4>

<H4>1. A customer can deal on a <FONT Color=#800040>Collected Funds</FONT> basis.
This means that the customer pays Signet either by a wire transfer
or a debit to the customer's Signet demand deposit account on
the same day of the trade. When the customer has foreign currency
to sell to Signet, funds must be wired to our correspondent bank
before a US dollar transfer or credit can be initiated.</H4>

<H4>2. Many of our customers use a <FONT Color=#800040>Margin Account</FONT>. The
customer pledges a portion of the contract amount at the time
of the trade by either depositing or investing funds with Signet
Bank. An internal hold is then placed on these funds. The margin
schedule is based on the volatility in the marketplace and the
time period for which the contract is placed. When the contract
is satisfied, the margin funds can be applied as partial payment
on the contract, remain on deposit/invested to be used for future
contracts, or be returned to the customer.</H4>

<H4>3. Another option is a <FONT Color=#800040>Foreign Exchange Line of Credit
</FONT>extended from Signet Bank to the customer. Approval is based
on a review of the company's most recent financial statements
to determine the ability to honor any contracts at maturity. There
is no actual lending or interest charged under this line, it simply
allows the customer to enter into contracts and make payment in
full on the value date. The line is expressed in two distinct
components; a maximum dollar amount allowed outstanding at any
time and the maximum period allowed for forward contracts.
<HR>

Cash receipts flow through the facility, changing the loan balance daily, thereby minimizing borrowing cost while maximizing loan availability.  The accounts receivable are collateral and the client retains the credit and collection risk.  In most cases, eligible inventory includes finished goods and raw materials owned by and in possession of the client, valued for advance purposes at FIFO net of reserves for obsolescence and for declines in market value.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+4 COLOR="#800000"><B><I>What is Asset Based Lending ?</I></B></FONT></CENTER>

<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> business financing tool that provides solutions to the needs of individual companies during periods of increased risk.  Does increased risk mean a troubled company or high risk loan?  The answer is a resounding <STRONG>NO</STRONG>!  These needs, and the accompanying additional risk, generally result from a combination of leverage and transition.  Periods of transition may include rapid growth, acquisitions, seasonal working capital requirements and DIP financing.  These needs are not always best served by traditional bank financing due to high leverage or a complex business structure.</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>The increased risk associated with a more highly leveraged or complex situation is best managed with collateral coverage and monitoring.  In providing a financing solution to the companys needs, assets (primarily accounts receivables, inventory and fixed assets) are used as collateral to create borrowing availability under the credit facility.  The fundamental strength of the asset-based loans is that they are structured  to be repaid from the proceeds of the collateral securing the loans.  As the level of assets and associated cash needs fluctuate, the borrowing availability also changes. </STRONG>

<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>ignet Business Credit has experience across many lines of business.  This enables us to tailor a product to fit your exact business needs.  Just take a look at some of our recent deals:</STRONG><BR><BR>

<HR WIDTH=95% ALIGN=center SIZE=5><BR>

<STRONG><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="#800000"><B>$20,000,000 Revolving Line of Credit and Term Loan to a National Commercial Printer.</B></FONT></CENTER>  <P>The transaction was referred to Signet Business Credit by a commercial banker who had received the financing request from an investment banker representing the company.  Signet competed with several other lenders on the transaction and was selected, in part, because we could offer a total long term banking relationship.  This relationship included trust and cash management and showed a quick response with a total team effort.  $5,000,000 of the line was sold down to a participant. </STRONG><BR><BR>

<HR WIDTH=95% ALIGN=center SIZE=5><BR>

<STRONG><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="#800000"><B>$2,000,000 Revolving Line of Credit Extended to an Eastern Virginia Food Distributor.</B></FONT></CENTER>  <P>Signet received the referral from a local bank who also participated in several joint calls on the prospect. The calling effort and strong support from an independent consultant resulted in our being able to fund this loan.</STRONG><BR><BR>

<HR WIDTH=95% ALIGN=center SIZE=5><BR>

<STRONG><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="#800000"><B>$5,000,000 Revolving Line of Credit to a Chemical Distributor.</B></FONT></CENTER>   <P>The line was used by this Maryland-based distributor to repay their borrowings from a commercial finance company.  The company was a former bank borrower and wanted to return to Signet.  Due to the leverage of the company, Signet Business Credit is the perfect fit while the company continues its profitable growth and deleveraging.</STRONG><BR><BR>

<HR WIDTH=95% ALIGN=center SIZE=5><BR>

<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="#800000"><B>$10,000,000 Revolving Line of Credit to a Regional Catalog Showroom and Retail Operation.</B></FONT>  <P>After this Maryland-based company filed for bankruptcy, Signet Business Credit provided DIP financing and subsequently assisted the company in a successful liquidation.  Signet is now investing some of the liquidation proceeds through the money center until distribution.</STRONG><BR><BR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+4 COLOR="#800000"><B>What is a REIT?</B></FONT></CENTER><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> REIT is a corporation or trust that combines the capital of many investors to acquire or provide financing for all forms of real estate.  A REIT serves much as a mutual fund for real estate, where smaller investors may pool assets, spread risk and reap the benefits of expert management.<P><STRONG><EM>An organization that qualifies as a REIT does not pay federal income tax.</EM>  The income that is distributed to investors is taxed at the investor level.  This is a unique feature and one of the most attractive aspects of REITs.  Most states honor this federal treatment and do not require REITs to pay state income tax.  REITs are required to distribute at least 95% of net income as dividends in order to maintain this protected status.<P>REITs are playing a major role in the growing shift from private to public ownership of real estate.  There are over 240 REITs operating in the United States today, and most trade on the national stock exchanges.  The market value of these stocks was estimated at over $55 billion at year-end 1995, and is growing rapidly.</STRONG></STRONG><BR><BR><HR WIDTH=95% ALIGN=center SIZE=5><BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="OPUNIT"><FONT SIZE=+4 COLOR="#800000"><B>What is an OP Unit?</B></FONT></CENTER></A><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT>s part of the rebirth of the REIT industry in the early 1990's, Wall Street created a new financing structure known as the UPREIT.   The UPREIT structure allows property owners to contribute their assets to REITs in exchange for partnership units, not stock, which is treated as a tax-free exchange by the IRS.  This enables individuals to sell their properties without triggering a tax liability and lets REITs maintain their cash reserves.  When property owners do wish to realize cash for the sale, they can exchange their Operating Partnership Units for stock which can be sold on the market, and can do so all at once or gradually, depending on their cash needs and tax considerations.<P>In order to satisfy market expectations for growth, REITs have actively pursued property acquisitions through the use of UPREIT units as currency.  The use of OP Units to purchase properties provides both a tax free solution for the seller and a cash free transaction for the REIT.</STRONG><BR><BR><HR WIDTH=95% ALIGN=center SIZE=5><BR><CENTER><STRONG><A HREF="reit.htm"> Home</A> | <A HREF="opliquid.htm"> OP Liquidity Program</A> | <A HREF="resear.htm"> Research </A>|<A HREF="email.htm">  Contact REIT Group</A></STRONG></CENTER><BR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+4 COLOR="#800000"><B>Per Capita Retail Space</B></FONT></CENTER>
<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>uch has been made recently of the idea that the United States is "overstored"- - that the problems in retail can be traced to the fact that there is simply more retail space on hand than anyone actually needs.  Experts note that per capita retail space in the U.S. is about 19 square feet, more than any other developed countries, and some have stated that about 14 square feet is all that is really needed. </STRONG><P><STRONG>A good way to test if space is needed is whether the space is actually selling goods.  This can be determined by calculating sales per square foot.  We've also provided information about historical trends in per capita space, sales/sq.ft, and sales/sq.ft in constant dollars to more easily compare results over long periods.<P>Contrary to popular belief, each square foot of retail space has produced higher and higher sales since 1992.  Yet, despite real sales/sq.ft never recovering to their peaks of the late 1980's, it was not until 1995 that bankruptcies and store closings began to appear in headlines.  The reason is that in the retail scene, it is no longer a question of how much space exists, but what form the space takes.<P>Efficiency has taken hold of retailing in a way never before possible.  Discounters and category killers, with their large boxes, new stores and relentless pursuit of price and cost advantages, are simply outcompeting older, less efficient retailers (e.g. Jamesway and Caldor, who recently declared bankruptcy).  In the past new, speculative construction was at risk in a weak retailing environment.  Now, as pre-leased space is built to house these large tenants, it may be the existing space that is more at risk.<P>The weakness in apparel sales appears now to be a secular trend, while sales of durables continue to be strong.  The aging of the baby boomers and the rise in casual dress are contributing factors.  We are seeing a number of mall clothing stores having trouble (Edison Bros., Fashion Bug).  The significance is that some large malls are dependent on apparel for perhaps 70-80% of their sales.<P>The ramifications of these trends are different than in a typical overbuilding situation.  The ability to build relationships with the stronger store lines is important.  At the same time, a broad tenant mix is important to spread risk.  The ability, both in management and in capital, to reconfigure outmoded centers into new formats is also becoming important.  Owners of malls are especially affected by these trends, since they are vulnerable to both competition from discounters and to weakness in apparel sales.  Mall owners also have less flexibility in reconfiguring their formats. </STRONG><BR><STRONG><CENTER><P>We have included a <A HREF="chart.htm"> chart</A> to accompany the above research.</CENTER></STRONG><BR>

<LI><STRONG>Per capita sf of shopping center space has increased without respite for over two decades.</STRONG><LI><STRONG>The industry added per capita space at a rapid rate during the late 1980s.  This, combined with the 1990-1991 recession, pushed real sales/sf down dramatically from 1987-1991.</STRONG><LI><STRONG>With constrained building and gradually improving incomes, real sales/sf have improved modestly each year since 1992 (although the second half of 1995 may have shown a decline).</STRONG>

<P>
An <FONT COLOR=#000080><STRONG>imprint</STRONG></FONT> account is structured to make mutual fund investing as easy as possible for you.  The <FONT COLOR=#000080><STRONG>imprint</STRONG></FONT> program take the burden of allocating, selecting and then managing a portfolio of mutual funds off your shoulders.  Once we've confirmed your investment objectives, risk tolerance, time frame and financial resources, an appropriate portfolio recommendation is prepared for you.  But it doesn't stop there.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>One decision does it all.</STRONG>  With just one investment decision you acquire a diversified, professionally-selected mutual fund portfolio.  You save hours and hours each year on analyzing, selecting, comparing and investing in a portfolio on your own.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>You enjoy professional portfolio management.</STRONG>  Even if you have the time to manage your own portfolio, chances are you can experience better results by relying on Signet investment professionals who have the advantages of training, experience and extensive research sources and analytical models.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>You're not limited to a single mutual fund family.</STRONG>  Some fund families are known for their equity funds others for their tax-free funds.  We want you to have what we believe are the best possible funds from each category to make up your <FONT COLOR=#000080><STRONG>imprint</STRONG></FONT> portfolio.  Therefore, we include well-known funds from the top families of funds -- including such companies as <STRONG>Fidelity, Janus, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Twentieth Century.</STRONG>  Many other managed portfolio accounts are typically limited to one particular family of funds.  With <FONT COLOR=#000080><STRONG>imprint</STRONG></FONT> you're <EM>not</EM> limited to only one family of funds and returns that may not be optimal for you.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Better than a single "asset allocation" or "balanced" mutual fund</STRONG> -- or any mutual fund that seeks to provide a complete portfolio in one fund -- because <FONT COLOR=#000080><STRONG>imprint</STRONG></FONT> goes one step better.  Your money is diversified across many different <EM>funds</EM> -- offering you far more expertise and research for uncovering promising securities.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>A single toll-free phone call</STRONG> puts you in touch with an <FONT COLOR=#000080><STRONG>imprint</STRONG></FONT> Investment Professional. . . and all the answers you need to open -- and manage -- your account.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>More affordable than most.</STRONG>  The minimum initial investment is surprisingly low ($10,000) and the yearly fees are quite low in comparison to other accounts of this type.<FONT  SIZE=-1><SUP>1, 3</SUP></FONT>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>You're never locked in.</STRONG>  Unlike some brokerage "wrap" accounts where you lose control of your money and there can be a fee to close your account, you're never locked in with <FONT COLOR=#000080><STRONG>imprint</STRONG></FONT>.  You are free to move your money at any time without penalty.<FONT  SIZE=-1><SUP>2</SUP></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Certificates of deposit (CDs) are another savings option.  Certificates of deposit are interest-bearing accounts that pay interest (variable or fixed) for an established period of time (term) during which time your funds are generally not accessible without penalty.  At the end of the term (maturity), you will receive your original investment and the interest that has accumulated. <P>

The advantage of this account type is that you can generally  receive a higher rate of interest than a standard deposit account.  Also, there are no charges for your deposit.  With terms that typically vary from one month to five years or more, you can match a term with a savings goal.  It is comforting to know your investment is shielded from economic changes.  As with other forms of savings, CDs purchased from FDIC member banks, including Signet,  are insured up to $100,000 per depositor.<P>

An important point to remember in choosing a CD is its yield. The yield represents the total amount you earn on the funds in your CD.  Instruments paying compound interest generate the highest yield. Compound interest occurs when interest for a period, quarterly for example, is added to the balance.  The new balance (for the second period) is the sum of the first periods balance plus the interest credit.  Interest for the second period is calculated on the new balance  and the process continues until maturity. <P>

A good strategy to remember with CDs is to stagger the maturity dates of your accounts to ensure you have access to funds when opportunities arise.  Choose CDs with different maturity dates and divide your total contribution among the various accounts.<P>

<CENTER><img src="images/banr_bar.jpg" ></CENTER><P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are retirement vehicles that you can open on your own, in contrast to employer sponsored plans.  The funds in these accounts grow tax deferred and you can contribute a maximum of $2,000 annually to the plan.<P>

These plans afford a number of benefits.  First is the fact that the tax deferment allows your funds to grow at an accelerated rate. Second, if you are not part of another retirement plan, you may be able to deduct your contribution (up to $2,000 yearly) from your taxable income.  Third, with a number of plans you have the option to direct where you want funds in your account to go.  The money can be placed in stocks, CDs, mutual funds, etc.  Finally, IRAs can offer a place to put away funds from qualified retirement plans, such as pension plans, 401ks, or other IRAs in what is called an  IRA rollover.  You might do this if you want to move the money from your qualified plan without having to pay taxes. Consult your tax advisor to determine what is best for you.<P>

Access to your IRA contributions is limited.  In most instances, your money must remain in your account until age 59 1/2 .  Should you withdraw IRA funds early, you will generally owe a penalty, usually no less than 10%, and the withdrawn amount is usually taxable as ordinary income in the year of the withdrawal.

<FONT SIZE=+1>Just a few years ago transacting financial business over the weekend could have been next to impossible.  No longer are you constrained by inconvenient business hours.  With ATMs you can perform many essential transactions 24 hours a day from a number of convenient locations. Within a bank's own ATM network, you can withdraw money, deposit checks, pay a credit card balance, or transfer funds.  Outside this ATM network, your ability to withdraw funds is extended to locations across the country and worldwide.<P>

For ATM access, you are provided with a plastic ATM card after opening your checking account.  To communicate with your automated teller, insert your card and enter a multi-digit code.  Your transaction options are presented in menu form.  After completing your transaction a record of your activity is printed out for you to keep.  Be sure to compare the information with your records, especially when accessing machines outside your institutions network.<P>

If you lose your ATM card or it is stolen, be sure to report it as soon as possible.<P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Direct Deposit is a money management tool that enables you to arrange for certain payments to be made automatically into a specified account.  Once established, your money is electronically deposited into the designated account on the day of payment and is usually available for use the same day.  You can choose to have your paychecks, investment earnings, pensions, and social security payments deposited in your account using this feature.  Business owners can take advantage of this technology and save money and frustration by setting up direct deposit for employee payroll checks.  It is also a convenient way to insure that you don't miss loan payments or other regular payments you need to make.<P>

There are a number of benefits to using direct deposit:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Security:  The possibility of a lost or stolen check is reduced, because the funds are transferred electronically.  
<LI>Convenience: You avoid wasting time depositing your check in person.  Even if you are out of town, your payment will be deposited on the day issued.  A check mailed can take several days to reach you, but with direct deposit, you avoid this delay.
<LI>Flexibility:  You can have your money directed to a number of accounts.

<FONT SIZE=+1>Check cards, or "debit cards" as they are referred to, are cards issued with checking accounts that allow you to use funds from your checking account at a point of sale.  It is simply a payment card that replaces your checkbook.   With a debit card you can pay for items purchased at merchants the same way you would with a <A HREF ="lendcard.htm">credit card</A>, except the funds are taken from the available funds in your checking account.  The card even doubles as an <A HREF ="checkatm.htm">ATM</A> card too, so you can take advantage of its dual functionality.<P>

Debit cards offer many benefits, such as:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Convenience:  Using the card is easy and avoids the bother and time of filling out a check.  Your transaction is recorded on your statement with details of where you made the purchase.  You can also use the card to access an ATM and take advantage of its features.  
<LI>Safety:  You do not have to carry large amounts of cash or checks.  Your card and access code are all you need to get your money.
<LI>Acceptability:  You can use your debit card at stores, restaurants, gas stations and anywhere else major credit cards are accepted.  Because of this acceptability, you can avoid the cost and inconvenience of using travelers checks while on a trip.  You can arrange to have money transferred to your checking account while on vacation.

Wrong Place, Wrong Time: Phoenix cosmetic surgeon Steven Locniker, on the lam for avoiding child-support charges, was arrested in September after he called attention to himself as Cosmopolitan magazine's "Bachelor of the Month." And Thomas Georgevitch, 22, on the lam for impersonating a police officer, was arrested in Bay Shore, N.Y., in October after a detective heard him call in to a radio station to make a song request (Johnny Rivers' "Secret Agent Man"). And Tom Tipton, 63, wanted on two warrants in Minneapolis, was arrested in November when a sheriff's officer recognized his name as the man singing the national anthem before the Vikings-Broncos game.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Dale L. Larson's $41,000 trial-court award was upheld by a Wisconsin appeals court in October, which agreed with the trial court that the Indianhead golf course in Wausau was 51 percent responsible for Larson's needing nine root canals and 23 dental crowns. Larson tripped on his golf spikes and fell hard on his face on a brick path outside the clubhouse, and he argued that he wouldn't have fallen if it had been a smooth concrete sidewalk rather than a brick path. The trial court had found that only 49 percent of the accident was due to Larson's having consumed 13 drinks that evening, which left him with a blood-alcohol level of 0.28 90 minutes after the fall. 
	
<li>
In July, Alex Alzaldua filed a $25,000 lawsuit against Dennis Hickey in Raymondville, Texas, alleging injuries caused by his "suddenly without warning" having tripped over Hickey's dog in the kitchen of Hickey's home. According to the lawsuit, Hickey should have warned Alzaldua that he was walking around in the kitchen "at his own risk" and that Hickey had failed to warn Alzaldua of "the dog's propensity of lying in certain areas."

On Oct. 17 firefighters took two hours to extinguish a fire at the Cal-Compack Foods plant in Las Cruces, N.M., that started when a silo full of red chile powder grew so hot that it began to smolder. 
	
<li>
Jeen Han, 22, was charged with conspiracy to commit murder in Irvine, Calif., in November, against her twin sister, Sunny. According to a police lieutenant, the "evil twin" was angry that the "good twin" had snitched on her regarding stolen credit cards and thus wanted to kill her and assume her identity.

<h2>In the Spotlight: Michael Redlick, <a href=" http://www.cleveland.com/community/volunteer/nba.html">NBA Jam Session</a> volunteer coordinator </h2><BR>
</center>
Kyle is hooping it with the NBA Jam Session volunteer coordinator.
<P>
<i>
<B>Kyle:</B>  Now  I am a worldly man but how exactly does one
get a job coordinating, training, recruiting and scheduling 2,500
volunteers?
<P>
<B>Redlick:</B> KeyCorp volunteered to sponsor the volunteer staff
on behalf of the CAVS Charities.  After agreeing to do this, Key
realized that it needed a dedicated staff member for this job.
 The <a href="http://www.nba.com/cavs/">Cleveland Cavaliers</a>
 recommended me to Kristina Clemo of Key
as I had just received a master's degree in sports administration
and the CAVS front office thought I was capable.  
<P>
<B>Kyle:</B> We now know how you ended up here, can you explain
a little bit about what the NBA Jam Session?
<p>
<img src="../images/spotlight/jamlogo.gif" width=240 height=169 align=left alt="NBA Jam Session Logo">
<P>
<B>Redlick:</B>  Jam Session is the NBA's premiere fan festival
which takes place during All-Star Weekend.  Now in its fifth year,
Jam Session has proven to be extremely popular with fans of all
ages.  We are expecting over 100,000 people to attend this year's
event which runs from Feb. 6-9 in the Cleveland Convention Center.
 The Convention Center will be transformed into a basketball theme
park with over 300,000 square feet of games, skills competitions,
inter-active video challenges, broadcast booths, bungee basketball,
trampoline basketball to name just a few of the activities.  There
really is something for everyone at Jam Session.
<P>
<B>Kyle:</B>  I always love a little one-on-one, do you have any
behind the scenes and need to knows for those attending the BIG
event? 
<P>
<B>Redlick:</B>  This event is huge.  <a href="brandon.htm">NBA Stars</a> and celebrities
from all aspects of show business will be on hand and competing
or signing autographs at various times throughout the event's
four days.  I would decide when I want to attend, buy my tickets
early (because many sessions do sell out) and plan on having a
great time for several hours.  You don't want to miss it.
<P>
<img src="../images/spotlight/jam1.gif" width=216 height=212 align=right hspace=3 alt="NBA Jam Session">
<p>
<B>Kyle:</B>  We all have our claim to fame. What interesting
sports personalities have you had the opportunity to met?
<P>
<B>Redlick:</B>  I've met several of the Cavaliers and Indians.
 Of course some of my friends think it's gone to my head because
Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan keep calling to hang out when
they're in Cleveland.  I'm trying to find the time for them but
I may have to pass this time.
<P>
<B>Kyle:</B> Now is basketball your specialty or do you coordinate
other sporting events.
<P>
<B>Redlick:</B>  Basketball is my specialty and I may continue
to do more of this type of events.  I'm also talking to several
teams in the NBA and Major League Baseball.  I really don't know
what I'm going to do after Jam Session other than collapse and
sleep for 72 hours.
<p>
<img src="../images/spotlight/jam2.gif" width=216 height=212 align=left hspace=3 alt="NBA Jam Session">
<P>
<B>Kyle:</B> Not every kid is athletically inclined, look at me.
What advise would you give a clumsy sports loving kid that wants
to get into sports management?
<P>
<B>Redlick:</B>  Go for it!  I practiced law for years and while
it was satisfying in many ways, I felt it was not what I wanted
to do forever.  I always wanted to run a professional sports franchise,
so two years ago I stopped practicing law, went back to school
and got a master's degree in sports management.  I haven't regretted
it for a second.  I'm sure I'll accomplish my long-term goals.
 And,  I'm having a blast every day!

<blockquote>
<img src="images/kyle/boogie.gif" border=0 align=right hspace=10 ALT="Kyle shakes it">
<P>
In your own words, just who is Kyle Kranium?
<P>

<I>
I am. I thought you knew that.
</I>
<P>

Well, yes I did.  I meant, what are you all about?
<P>

<I>
 I'm about the 'Net. The Web, to be more specific. 
</I>
<P>

What do you mean?
<P>

<I>
I mean that I live here. And there. Pretty much anywhere I want. You see, the Web is a bunch of virtual locations all over this mother ship you folks call earth...held together by cables and computers. Hmmm, I like the way that sounds. Cables and computers, cables and computers - they go together just like peanut butter and jelly.
</I>
<P>

Were you born on the 'Net?
<P>

<I>
I suppose! But I don't really remember my birth. But I'm pretty sure I was born. I mean, do you remember your birth? I think I've made my point.
</I>
<P>

So if you were born on the 'Net, and you live on the 'Net, you're sort of a virtual guy, Right?
<P>

<I>
Bingo! You get to go to the bonus round.
</I>
<P>

I'm not sure I understand what it means to be a virtual guy.
<P>

<I>
That's because you're not. Unfortunately for you, you are un-virtual--plasma, tissue, bones and other icky stuff. Us virtual folks are very clean, no icky stuff. To be virtual is to be here, there and everywhere. All at the same time.
</I>
<P>

Some say you are a "special" person. That you are gifted. What do you say to that?
<P>

<I>
I say, "they're right." I happen to have an IQ measurement in terabytes. I have an incredible amount of information stored in my noggin. You see, I've traveled quite a bit in my time and have seen all kinds of stuff. When you have complete access to the 'Net you can do that.
</I>
<P>

You mentioned that you have stored a large amount of information in your "noggin." Is that why your head is so big?
<P>
<img src="images/animate/skating.gif" align=left border=0 width=300 height=73 al
t="Wild Man Kyle on rollerblades.">

<I>
Yes, my noggin is a-burstin' with information. Some important, some incredibly useless. As for the size of my cranium, I've got one word for you Bippy:  "Evolution." You've heard of Darwin, I hope.
</I>
<P>
How did you get to be the host of KeyNN?<P>

<I>Key was looking for a unique individual. Someone who understood our wired visitors and the 'Net itself. Someone who could guide our Key friends to wherever they need to go. Obviously, I possess these characteristics. But I think my sparkling personality and undeniably good looks probably pushed me over the top.</I>
<P>

Any last thoughts on being the most happening item on the 'Net?
<P>

<I>
Not really. I mean, it's all happened so suddenly. I do want to assure those that have known me from the beginning, however, that this instant fame will not change me. I will not allow it to go to my head. Why are you staring at my forehead?
</I>
<P>
