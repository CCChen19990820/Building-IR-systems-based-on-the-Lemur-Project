 <P><H2>Robertson v. Thomson</H2>
</P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>A HUNDRED MILLION FIGHT - COPYRIGHT ON THE
INFOBAHN<BR>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<I>(Simon Chester is the research partner and a member of the
KNOWlaw Group of the Toronto law firm of McMillan Binch. This
article was prepared with the assistance of Lauralee Bielert.)
<BR>
</I>
<P>
It's time to take copyright seriously. Freelance writers, photographers
and illustrators delivered this message loud and clear with the
launch last month of a $100 million class action suit against
Thomson Corp. Heather Robertson, a prize winning non-fiction author,
launched the suit on behalf of all Canadian freelancers. <BR>
<P>
Robertson, whose book <I>Driving Force</I> won the 1996 Canadian
Business Book Award, has earned a living as a full-time freelance
writer for the last 25 years. The suit claims Thomson placed freelance
materials in electronic databases without payment or authorization.
<BR>
<P>
For producers of films or television programs, the Thomson suit
is a sharp reminder that anytime they have a freelancer do any
piece of work, they should make sure that there is a certain clear
written agreement in place setting out the media in which the
producer can make use of the freelancer's work.<BR>
<P>
Thomson's Troubles<BR>
<P>
The Globe and Mail launched its Infoglobe electronic database
in 1978, but it's only recently that freelance writers have begun
to demand compensation for the electronic publication of their
work. <BR>
<P>
For many years, the freelance/publisher relationship was quite
informal. According to general industry standards, a writer owned
an article and assigned first North American publication rights
to the acquiring newspaper or magazine, retaining the right to
resell the story to other publications. <BR>
<P>
Until recently, newspapers didn't even bother with assignment
letters let alone formal contracts, and electronic rights simply
weren't in issue.<BR>
<P>
But the new technologies have, over the last few years, raised
tough questions about risk - and reward - on the electronic highway.
The issue has been most pointedly raised, not by salaried journalists,
but by freelancers. Freelancers have expressed surprise and outrage
in finding that their work has been loaded on electronic databases
- or even on the Internet - without their permission.<BR>
<P>
What brought the issue to a head, earlier this year, was Thomson's
decision to request formal legal waivers from writers, illustrators
and photographers. Thomson was not alone: Southam, Telemedia,
and Maclean Hunter also asked contributors to sign over the rights
to their works.<BR>
<P>
In some cases, the legal language in the agreements was very broad.
For instance, the Financial Post contract asked for a &quot;non-exclusive,
perpetual, worldwide right to publish, use, sell or resell the
Work in any manner, form or media and by any means or technology
now used or hereafter used&quot;. <BR>
<P>
Other publications asked freelancers to waive their &quot;moral
rights&quot; - that is the right of creators to protect the integrity
of their work. This waiver (standard in the film and television
industries) alarmed many of the freelancers, given the ease with
which text, sound and images can be transmitted and stored in
easily manipulable bits and bytes.<BR>
<P>
What angered creators most, though, was that they were asked to
sign over their rights without any additional compensation. The
Periodical Writers Association of Canada responded to this by
enlisting the help of other writers' organizations. The end result
was the suit launched against Thomson in which the plaintiffs
are seeking damages all the way back to 1979.<BR>
<P>
Who Owns a Writer's Work?<BR>
<P>
Legally, the dispute centres around the provisions of the <I>Copyright
Act</I> which make the individual who creates a work the first
owner of the copyright in that work. This means that freelancers
retain all rights to their works except those expressly assigned
to the publisher. In other words, publishers cannot appropriate
freelance works for use in other contexts. <BR>
<P>
Employees, on the other hand, fall under an exception to the general
rule: the &quot;employer-employee&quot; exception, which provides
that the copyright of any works created by an employee in the
course of employment belongs to the employer. The situation is
further complicated by an &quot;exception to the exception&quot;
- employees who work for newspapers and magazines have the right
to restrain the publication of their works other than as part
of newspapers or periodicals. In other words, newspapers and magazines
may not have the right to use their employees' work in the electronic
media without the employees' permission.<BR>
<P>
There's a lesson here. Producers and broadcasters using freelance
or employed writers should review their practices to make sure
they have all the rights they need or may want in the future.
<BR>
<P>
U.S. Developments<BR>
<P>
While copyright differs between Canada and the U.S., similar battles
are taking place in both countries. <BR>
<P>
The highest profile fight is being led by the President of the
National Writers Union, John Tasini. In 1993, Tasini and eleven
other writers launched a suit against the New York Times and four
other news and database companies. <BR>
<P>
It is estimated that if Tasini wins his case, the liabilities
could go into the millions of dollars. Three writers' unions have
already boycotted The New York Times over its contractual demands
relating to electronic rights. One magazine - Harper's - has already
agreed to split revenues 50/50 from on-line and CD-Rom products.
<BR>
<P>
The Future of Copyright<BR>
<P>
Rethinking old practices is problematic. Even if publishers and
other producers of product for the electronic media were willing
to compensate writers for this use, there are huge practical issues
to consider. <BR>
<P>
One is how to track the use and reproduction of works for the
purposes of enforcement and compensation. Tracking has been a
particular problem in the context of electronic databases. Publishers
argue that it is difficult, if not impossible, to track use and
accurately determine the amount of revenue owing to individual
contributors.<BR>
<P>
Creators have responded with a number of practical solutions to
get around the problems of determining appropriate levels of compensation.
The National Writers Union in the U.S., for example, has set up
a publication rights clearinghouse modelled after long-standing
music organizations such as ASCAP. Photographers in the U.S. have
set up a similar clearinghouse. <BR>
<P>
Other writers' groups are proposing a simple flat fee system.
Computer buffs are looking at a way of electronically tagging
their works so that user access through electronic databases can
be tracked automatically.<BR>
<P>
Robertson's case has moved electronic copyright issues to centre
stage. Whether her case ever gets to court is an open question.
With $100 million at stake, we need a serious debate on how creators,
publishers and other producers should profit from the electronic
highway. <BR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE =4><DD>"Humanity now seems bent on creating a world economy primarily based on goods that take no
material form. In doing so, we may be eliminating any predictable connection between creators and
a fair reward for the utility or pleasure others may find in their works.<P> 

<DD>Without that connection, and without a fundamental change in consciousness to accommodate its
loss, we are building our future on furor, litigation, and institutionalized evasion of payment except
in response to raw force. We may return to the Bad Old Days of property.<P> 

<DD>Throughout the darker parts of human history, the possession and distribution of property was a
largely military matter. "Ownership" was assured those with the nastiest tools, whether fists or
armies, and the most resolute will to use them. Property was the divine right of thugs.<P> 

<DD>By the turn of the First Millennium AD, the emergence of merchant classes and landed gentry
forced the development of ethical understandings for the resolution of property disputes. In the
Middle Ages, enlightened rulers like England's Henry II began to codify this unwritten "common
law" into recorded canons. These laws were local, which didn't matter much as they were
primarily directed at real estate, a form of property that is local by definition. And, as the name
implied, was very real.<P> 

<DD>This continued to be the case as long as the origin of wealth was agricultural, but with that dawning
of the Industrial Revolution, humanity began to focus as much on means as ends. Tools acquired a
new social value and, thanks to their development, it became possible to duplicate and distribute
them in quantity.<P> 

<DD>To encourage their invention, copyright and patent law were developed in most Western countries.
These laws were devoted to the delicate task of getting mental creations into the world where they
could be used - and could enter the minds of others - while assuring their inventors compensation
for the value of their use. And, as previously stated, the systems of both law and practice which
grew up around that task were based on physical expression. <P>

<DD>Since it is now possible to convey ideas from one mind to another without ever making them
physical, we are now claiming to own ideas themselves and not merely their expression. And since
it is likewise now possible to create useful tools that never take physical form, we have taken to
patenting abstractions, sequences of virtual events, and mathematical formulae - the most unreal
estate imaginable.<P> 

<DD>In certain areas, this leaves rights of ownership in such an ambiguous condition that property again
adheres to those who can muster the largest armies. The only difference is that this time the armies
consist of lawyers. <P>

<DD>Threatening their opponents with the endless purgatory of litigation, over which some might prefer
death itself, they assert claim to any thought which might have entered another cranium within the
collective body of the corporations they serve. They act as though these ideas appeared in splendid
detachment from all previous human thought. And they pretend that thinking about a product is
somehow as good as manufacturing, distributing, and selling it.<P> 

<DD>What was previously considered a common human resource, distributed among the minds and
libraries of the world, as well as the phenomena of nature herself, is now being fenced and deeded.
It is as though a new class of enterprise had arisen that claimed to own the air. <P>

<DD>What is to be done? While there is a certain grim fun to be had in it, dancing on the grave of
copyright and patent will solve little, especially when so few are willing to admit that the occupant
of this grave is even deceased, and so many are trying to uphold by force what can no longer be
upheld by popular consent.<P> 

<DD>The legalists, desperate over their slipping grip, are vigorously trying to extend their reach. Indeed,
the United States and other proponents of GATT are making adherence to our moribund systems of
intellectual property protection a condition of membership in the marketplace of nations. For
example, China will be denied Most Favored Nation trading status unless they agree to uphold a set
of culturally alien principles that are no longer even sensibly applicable in their country of origin.<P> 

<DD>In a more perfect world, we'd be wise to declare a moratorium on litigation, legislation, and
international treaties in this area until we had a clearer sense of the terms and conditions of
enterprise in cyberspace. Ideally, laws ratify already developed social consensus. They are less the
Social Contract itself than a series of memoranda expressing a collective intent that has emerged out
of many millions of human interactions.<P> 

<DD>Humans have not inhabited cyberspace long enough or in sufficient diversity to have developed a
Social Contract which conforms to the strange new conditions of that world. Laws developed prior
to consensus usually favor the already established few who can get them passed and not society as
a whole.<P> 

<DD>To the extent that law and established social practice exists in this area, they are already in
dangerous disagreement. The laws regarding unlicensed reproduction of commercial software are
clear and stern...and rarely observed. Software piracy laws are so practically unenforceable and
breaking them has become so socially acceptable that only a thin minority appears compelled, either
by fear or conscience, to obey them. When I give speeches on this subject, I always ask how many
people in the audience can honestly claim to have no unauthorized software on their hard disks.
I've never seen more than 10 percent of the hands go up.<P> 

<DD>Whenever there is such profound divergence between law and social practice, it is not society that
adapts. Against the swift tide of custom, the software publishers' current practice of hanging a few
visible scapegoats is so obviously capricious as to only further diminish respect for the law.<P> 

<DD>Part of the widespread disregard for commercial software copyrights stems from a legislative
failure to understand the conditions into which it was inserted. To assume that systems of law
based in the physical world will serve in an environment as fundamentally different as cyberspace
is a folly for which everyone doing business in the future will pay.<P> 

<DD>As I will soon discuss in detail, unbounded intellectual property is very different from physical
property and can no longer be protected as though these differences did not exist. For example, if
we continue to assume that value is based on scarcity, as it is with regard to physical objects, we
will create laws that are precisely contrary to the nature of information, which may, in many cases,
increase in value with distribution.<P> 

<DD>The large, legally risk-averse institutions most likely to play by the old rules will suffer for their
compliance. As more lawyers, guns, and money are invested in either protecting their rights or
subverting those of their opponents, their ability to produce new technology will simply grind to a
halt as every move they make drives them deeper into a tar pit of courtroom warfare. <P>

<DD>Faith in law will not be an effective strategy for high-tech companies. Law adapts by continuous
increments and at a pace second only to geology. Technology advances in lunging jerks, like the
punctuation of biological evolution grotesquely accelerated. Real-world conditions will continue to
change at a blinding pace, and the law will lag further behind, more profoundly confused. This
mismatch may prove impossible to overcome.<P>

<DD>Promising economies based on purely digital products will either be born in a state of paralysis, as
appears to be the case with multimedia, or continue in a brave and willful refusal by their owners to
play the ownership game at all.<P> 

<DD>In the United States one can already see a parallel economy developing, mostly among small, fast
moving enterprises who protect their ideas by getting into the marketplace quicker then their larger
competitors who base their protection on fear and litigation.<P> 

<DD>Perhaps those who are part of the problem will simply quarantine themselves in court, while those
who are part of the solution will create a new society based, at first, on piracy and freebooting. It
may well be that when the current system of intellectual property law has collapsed, as seems
inevitable, that no new legal structure will arise in its place.<P> 

<DD>But something will happen. After all, people do business. When a currency becomes meaningless,
business is done in barter. When societies develop outside the law, they develop their own
unwritten codes, practices, and ethical systems. While technology may undo law, technology
offers methods for restoring creative rights.<P> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>A Taxonomy of Information</FONT></CENTER><P>

<DD>It seems to me that the most productive thing to do now is to look into the true nature of what we're
trying to protect. How much do we really know about information and its natural behaviors? <P>

<DD>What are the essential characteristics of unbounded creation? How does it differ from previous
forms of property? How many of our assumptions about it have actually been about its containers
rather than their mysterious contents? What are its different species and how does each of them
lend itself to control? What technologies will be useful in creating new virtual bottles to replace the
old physical ones? <P>

<DD>Of course, information is, by nature, intangible and hard to define. Like other such deep
phenomena as light or matter, it is a natural host to paradox. It is most helpful to understand light
as being both a particle and a wave, an understanding of information may emerge in the abstract
congruence of its several different properties which might be described by the following three
statements:<P> 

        <DD>Information is an activity. 
        <DD>Information is a life form. 
        <DD>Information is a relationship.<P> 
In the following section, I will examine each of these..." <P></FONT>

<CENTER>Part 3</CENTER><P>
<HR>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>I. INFORMATION IS AN ACTIVITY</FONT></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=400><TB><TD><P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>"Information Is a Verb, Not a Noun</B></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=4><DD>Freed of its containers, information is obviously not a thing. In fact, it is something that happens in
the field of interaction between minds or objects or other pieces of information.<P> 

<DD>Gregory Bateson, expanding on the information theory of Claude Shannon, said, "Information is a
difference which makes a difference." Thus, information only really exists in the Delta. The
making of that difference is an activity within a relationship. Information is an action which
occupies time rather than a state of being which occupies physical space, as is the case with hard
goods. It is the pitch, not the baseball, the dance, not the dancer.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Information Is Experienced, Not Possessed</FONT><P>

<DD>Even when it has been encapsulated in some static form like a book or a hard disk, information is
still something that happens to you as you mentally decompress it from its storage code. But,
whether it's running at gigabits per second or words per minute, the actual decoding is a process
that must be performed by and upon a mind, a process that must take place in time.<P> 

<DD>There was a cartoon in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists a few years ago that illustrated this point
beautifully. In the drawing, a holdup man trains his gun on the sort of bespectacled fellow you'd
figure might have a lot of information stored in his head. "Quick," orders the bandit, "give me all
your ideas."<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Information Has to Move</FONT><P>
<DD>Sharks are said to die of suffocation if they stop swimming, and the same is nearly true of
information. Information that isn't moving ceases to exist as anything but potential...at least until it
is allowed to move again. For this reason, the practice of information hoarding, common in
bureaucracies, is an especially wrong-headed artifact of physically based value systems.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Information Is Conveyed by Propagation, Not Distribution</FONT><P>

<DD>The way in which information spreads is also very different from the distribution of physical
goods. It moves more like something from nature than from a factory. It can concatenate like
falling dominos or grow in the usual fractal lattice, like frost spreading on a window, but it cannot
be shipped around like widgets, except to the extent that it can be contained in them. It doesn't
simply move on; it leaves a trail everywhere it's been.<P> 

<DD>The central economic distinction between information and physical property is that information can
be transferred without leaving the possession of the original owner. If I sell you my horse, I can't
ride him after that. If I sell you what I know, we both know it.<P> 
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=5><CENTER>II. INFORMATION IS A LIFE FORM</CENTER></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Information Wants to Be Free</FONT><P>

<DD>Stewart Brand is generally credited with this elegant statement of the obvious, which recognizes
both the natural desire of secrets to be told and the fact that they might be capable of possessing
something like a "desire" in the first place.<P> 

<DD>English biologist and philosopher Richard Dawkins proposed the idea of "memes," self-replicating
patterns of information that propagate themselves across the ecologies of mind, a pattern of
reproduction much like that of life forms.<P> 

<DD>I believe they are life forms in every respect but their freedom from the carbon atom. They
self-reproduce, they interact with their surroundings and adapt to them, they mutate, they persist.
They evolve to fill the empty niches of their local environments, which are, in this case the
surrounding belief systems and cultures of their hosts, namely, us.<P> 

<DD>Indeed, sociobiologists like Dawkins make a plausible case that carbon-based life forms are
information as well, that, as the chicken is an egg's way of making another egg, the entire
biological spectacle is just the DNA molecule's means of copying out more information strings
exactly like itself.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Information Replicates into the Cracks of Possibility</FONT><P>

<DD>Like DNA helices, ideas are relentless expansionists, always seeking new opportunities for
Lebensraum. And, as in carbon-based nature, the more robust organisms are extremely adept at
finding new places to live. Thus, just as the common housefly has insinuated itself into practically
every ecosystem on the planet, so has the meme of "life after death" found a niche in most minds,
or psycho-ecologies.<P> 

<DD>The more universally resonant an idea or image or song , the more minds it will enter and remain
within. Trying to stop the spread of a really robust piece of information is about as easy as keeping
killer bees south of the border.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Information Wants to Change</FONT><P>

<DD>If ideas and other interactive patterns of information are indeed life forms, they can be expected to
evolve constantly into forms which will be more perfectly adapted to their surroundings. And, as
we see, they are doing this all the time.<P> 

<DD>But for a long time, our static media, whether carvings in stone, ink on paper, or dye on celluloid,
have strongly resisted the evolutionary impulse, exalting as a consequence the author's ability to
determine the finished product. But, as in an oral tradition, digitized information has no "final cut."<P>

<DD>Digital information, unconstrained by packaging, is a continuing process more like the
metamorphosing tales of prehistory than anything that will fit in shrink-wrap. From the Neolithic to
Gutenberg (monks aside), information was passed on, mouth to ear, changing with every retelling
(or resinging). The stories which once shaped our sense of the world didn't have authoritative
versions. They adapted to each culture in which they found themselves being told.<P> 

<DD>Because there was never a moment when the story was frozen in print, the so-called "moral" right
of storytellers to own the tale was neither protected nor recognized. The story simply passed
through each of them on its way to the next, where it would assume a different form. As we return
to continuous information, we can expect the importance of authorship to diminish. Creative people
may have to renew their acquaintance with humility.<P> 

<DD>But our system of copyright makes no accommodation whatever for expressions which don't
become fixed at some point nor for cultural expressions which lack a specific author or inventor.<P> 

<DD>Jazz improvisations, stand-up comedy routines, mime performances, developing monologues, and
unrecorded broadcast transmissions all lack the Constitutional requirement of fixation as a
"writing." Without being fixed by a point of publication the liquid works of the future will all look
more like these continuously adapting and changing forms and will therefore exist beyond the reach
of copyright.<P> 

<DD>Copyright expert Pamela Samuelson tells of having attended a conference last year convened
around the fact that Western countries may legally appropriate the music, designs, and biomedical
lore of aboriginal people without compensation to their tribes of origin since those tribes are not an
"author" or "inventors."<P> 

<DD>But soon most information will be generated collaboratively by the cyber-tribal hunter-gatherers of
cyberspace. Our arrogant legal dismissal of the rights of "primitives" will be soon return to haunt
us.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Information Is Perishable</FONT><P>

<DD>With the exception of the rare classic, most information is like farm produce. Its quality degrades
rapidly both over time and in distance from the source of production. But even here, value is highly
subjective and conditional. Yesterday's papers are quite valuable to the historian. In fact, the older
they are, the more valuable they become. On the other hand, a commodities broker might consider
news of an event that occurred more than an hour ago to have lost any relevance.<P> 
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=5><CENTER>III. INFORMATION IS A RELATIONSHIP</CENTER></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Meaning Has Value and Is Unique to Each Case</FONT><P>

<DD>In most cases, we assign value to information based on its meaningfulness. The place where
information dwells, the holy moment where transmission becomes reception, is a region which has
many shifting characteristics and flavors depending on the relationship of sender and receiver, the
depth of their interactivity.<P> 

<DD>Each such relationship is unique. Even in cases where the sender is a broadcast medium, and no
response is returned, the receiver is hardly passive. Receiving information is often as creative an
act as generating it.<P> 

<DD>The value of what is sent depends entirely on the extent to which each individual receiver has the
receptors - shared terminology, attention, interest, language, paradigm - necessary to render what
is received meaningful.<P> 

<DD>Understanding is a critical element increasingly overlooked in the effort to turn information into a
commodity. Data may be any set of facts, useful or not, intelligible or inscrutable, germane or
irrelevant. Computers can crank out new data all night long without human help, and the results
may be offered for sale as information. They may or may not actually be so. Only a human being
can recognize the meaning that separates information from data.<P> 

<DD>In fact, information, in the economic sense of the word, consists of data which have been passed
through a particular human mind and found meaningful within that mental context. One fella's
information is all just data to someone else. If you're an anthropologist, my detailed charts of
Tasaday kinship patterns might be critical information to you. If you're a banker from Hong Kong,
they might barely seem to be data.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Familiarity Has More Value than Scarcity</FONT><P>

<DD>With physical goods, there is a direct correlation between scarcity and value. Gold is more valuable
than wheat, even though you can't eat it. While this is not always the case, the situation with
information is often precisely the reverse. Most soft goods increase in value as they become more
common. Familiarity is an important asset in the world of information. It may often be true that the
best way to raise demand for your product is to give it away.<P> 

<DD>While this has not always worked with shareware, it could be argued that there is a connection
between the extent to which commercial software is pirated and the amount which gets sold.
Broadly pirated software, such as Lotus 1-2-3 or WordPerfect, becomes a standard and benefits
from Law of Increasing Returns based on familiarity.<P> 

<DD>In regard to my own soft product, rock 'n' roll songs, there is no question that the band I write
them for, the Grateful Dead, has increased its popularity enormously by giving them away. We
have been letting people tape our concerts since the early seventies, but instead of reducing the
demand for our product, we are now the largest concert draw in America, a fact that is at least in
part attributable to the popularity generated by those tapes.<P> 

<DD>True, I don't get any royalties on the millions of copies of my songs which have been extracted
from concerts, but I see no reason to complain. The fact is, no one but the Grateful Dead can
perform a Grateful Dead song, so if you want the experience and not its thin projection, you have
to buy a ticket from us. In other words, our intellectual property protection derives from our being
the only real-time source of it.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Exclusivity Has Value</FONT><P>

<DD>The problem with a model that turns the physical scarcity/value ratio on its head is that sometimes
the value of information is very much based on its scarcity. Exclusive possession of certain facts
makes them more useful. If everyone knows about conditions which might drive a stock price up,
the information is valueless. <P>

<DD>But again, the critical factor is usually time. It doesn't matter if this kind of information eventually
becomes ubiquitous. What matters is being among the first who possess it and act on it. While
potent secrets usually don't stay secret, they may remain so long enough to advance the cause of
their original holders.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Point of View and Authority Have Value</FONT><P>

<DD>In a world of floating realities and contradictory maps, rewards will accrue to those commentators
whose maps seem to fit their territory snugly, based on their ability to yield predictable results for
those who use them.<P> 

<DD>In aesthetic information, whether poetry or rock 'n' roll, people are willing to buy the new product
of an artist, sight-unseen, based on their having been delivered a pleasurable experience by
previous work.<P> 

<DD>Reality is an edit. People are willing to pay for the authority of those editors whose point of view
seems to fit best. And again, point of view is an asset which cannot be stolen or duplicated. No one
sees the world as Esther Dyson does, and the handsome fee she charges for her newsletter is
actually payment for the privilege of looking at the world through her unique eyes. <P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Time Replaces Space</FONT><P>

<DD>In the physical world, value depends heavily on possession or proximity in space. One owns the
material that falls inside certain dimensional boundaries. The ability to act directly, exclusively, and
as one wishes upon what falls inside those boundaries is the principal right of ownership. The
relationship between value and scarcity is a limitation in space.<P> 

<DD>In the virtual world, proximity in time is a value determinant. An informational product is generally
more valuable the closer purchaser can place themselves to the moment of its expression, a
limitation in time. Many kinds of information degrade rapidly with either time or reproduction.
Relevance fades as the territory they map changes. Noise is introduced and bandwidth lost with
passage away from the point where the information is first produced.<P> 

<DD>Thus, listening to a Grateful Dead tape is hardly the same experience as attending a Grateful Dead
concert. The closer one can get to the headwaters of an informational stream, the better one's
chances of finding an accurate picture of reality in it. In an era of easy reproduction, the
informational abstractions of popular experiences will propagate out from their source moments to
reach anyone who's interested. But it's easy enough to restrict the real experience of the desirable
event, whether knock-out punch or guitar lick, to those willing to pay for being there.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>The Protection of Execution</FONT><P>

<DD>In the hick town I come from, they don't give you much credit for just having ideas. You are
judged by what you can make of them. As things continue to speed up, I think we see that
execution is the best protection for those designs which become physical products. Or, as Steve
Jobs once put it, "Real artists ship." The big winner is usually the one who gets to the market first
(and with enough organizational force to keep the lead).<P> 

<DD>But, as we become fixated upon information commerce, many of us seem to think that originality
alone is sufficient to convey value, deserving, with the right legal assurances, of a steady wage. In
fact, the best way to protect intellectual property is to act on it. It's not enough to invent and patent;
one has to innovate as well. Someone claims to have patented the microprocessor before Intel.
Maybe so. If he'd actually started shipping microprocessors before Intel, his claim would seem far
less spurious.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Information as Its Own Reward</FONT><P>

<DD>It is now a commonplace to say that money is information. With the exception of Krugerrands,
crumpled cab fare, and the contents of those suitcases that drug lords are reputed to carry, most of
the money in the informatized world is in ones and zeros. The global money supply sloshes around
the Net, as fluid as weather. It is also obvious, that information has become as fundamental to the
creation of modern wealth as land and sunlight once were.<P> 

<DD>What is less obvious is the extent to which information is acquiring intrinsic value, not as a means
to acquisition but as the object to be acquired. I suppose this has always been less explicitly the
case. In politics and academia, potency and information have always been closely related.<P> 

<DD>However, as we increasingly buy information with money, we begin to see that buying
information with other information is simple economic exchange without the necessity of
converting the product into and out of currency. This is somewhat challenging for those who like
clean accounting, since, information theory aside, informational exchange rates are too squishy to
quantify to the decimal point.<P> 

<DD>Nevertheless, most of what a middle-class American purchases has little to do with survival. We
buy beauty, prestige, experience, education, and all the obscure pleasures of owning. Many of
these things can not only be expressed in nonmaterial terms, they can be acquired by nonmaterial
means. <P>

<DD>And then there are the inexplicable pleasures of information itself, the joys of learning, knowing,
and teaching; the strange good feeling of information coming into and out of oneself. Playing with
ideas is a recreation which people are willing to pay a lot for, given the market for books and
elective seminars. We'd likely spend even more money for such pleasures if we didn't have so
many opportunities to pay for ideas with other ideas.<P> 

<DD>This explains much of the collective "volunteer" work which fills the archives, newsgroups, and
databases of the Internet. Its denizens are not working for "nothing," as is widely believed. Rather
they are getting paid in something besides money. It is an economy which consists almost entirely
of information.<P> 

<DD>This may become the dominant form of human trade, and if we persist in modeling economics on a
strictly monetary basis, we may be gravely misled..."<P> </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Getting Paid in Cyberspace</B></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=4><DD>"How all the foregoing relates to solutions to the crisis in intellectual property is something I've
barely started to wrap my mind around. It's fairly paradigm warping to look at information through
fresh eyes - to see how very little it is like pig iron or pork bellies, and to imagine the tottering
travesties of case law we will stack up if we go on legally treating it as though it were.<P> 

<DD>As I've said, I believe these towers of outmoded boilerplate will be a smoking heap sometime in
the next decade, and we mind miners will have no choice but to cast our lot with new systems that
work.<P> 

<DD>I'm not really so gloomy about our prospects as readers of this jeremiad so far might conclude.
Solutions will emerge. Nature abhors a vacuum and so does commerce.<P> 

<DD>Indeed, one of the aspects of the electronic frontier which I have always found most appealing -
and the reason Mitch Kapor and I used that phrase in naming our foundation - is the degree to
which it resembles the 19th-century American West in its natural preference for social devices that
emerge from its conditions rather than those that are imposed from the outside. <P>

<DD>Until the West was fully settled and "civilized" in this century, order was established according to
an unwritten Code of the West, which had the fluidity of common law rather than the rigidity of
statutes. Ethics were more important than rules. Understandings were preferred over laws, which
were, in any event, largely unenforceable.<P> 

<DD>I believe that law, as we understand it, was developed to protect the interests which arose in the
two economic "waves" which Alvin Toffler accurately identified in The Third Wave. The First
Wave was agriculturally based and required law to order ownership of the principal source of
production, land. In the Second Wave, manufacturing became the economic mainspring, and the
structure of modern law grew around the centralized institutions that needed protection for their
reserves of capital, labor, and hardware.<P> 

<DD>Both of these economic systems required stability. Their laws were designed to resist change and
to assure some equability of distribution within a fairly static social framework. The empty niches
had to be constrained to preserve the predictability necessary to either land stewardship or capital
formation.<P> 

<DD>In the Third Wave we have now entered, information to a large extent replaces land, capital, and
hardware, and information is most at home in a much more fluid and adaptable environment. The
Third Wave is likely to bring a fundamental shift in the purposes and methods of law which will
affect far more than simply those statutes which govern intellectual property.<P> 

<DD>The "terrain" itself - the architecture of the Net - may come to serve many of the purposes which
could only be maintained in the past by legal imposition. For example, it may be unnecessary to
constitutionally assure freedom of expression in an environment which, in the words of my fellow
EFF co-founder John Gilmore, "treats censorship as a malfunction" and reroutes proscribed ideas
around it.<P> 

<DD>Similar natural balancing mechanisms may arise to smooth over the social discontinuities which
previously required legal intercession to set right. On the Net, these differences are more likely to
be spanned by a continuous spectrum that connects as much as it separates.<P> 

<DD>And, despite their fierce grip on the old legal structure, companies that trade in information are
likely to find that their increasing inability to deal sensibly with technological issues will not be
remedied in the courts, which won't be capable of producing verdicts predictable enough to be
supportive of long-term enterprise. Every litigation will become like a game of Russian roulette,
depending on the depth of the presiding judge's clue-impairment.<P> 

<DD>Uncodified or adaptive "law," while as "fast, loose, and out of control" as other emergent forms, is
probably more likely to yield something like justice at this point. In fact, one can already see in
development new practices to suit the conditions of virtual commerce. The life forms of
information are evolving methods to protect their continued reproduction.<P> 

<DD>For example, while all the tiny print on a commercial diskette envelope punctiliously requires a
great deal of those who would open it, few who read those provisos follow them to the letter. And
yet, the software business remains a very healthy sector of the American economy.<P> 

<DD>Why is this? Because people seem to eventually buy the software they really use. Once a program
becomes central to your work, you want the latest version of it, the best support, the actual
manuals, all privileges attached to ownership. Such practical considerations will, in the absence of
working law, become more and more important in getting paid for what might easily be obtained
for nothing. <P>

<DD>I do think that some software is being purchased in the service of ethics or the abstract awareness
that the failure to buy it will result in its not being produced any longer, but I'm going to leave
those motivators aside. While I believe that the failure of law will almost certainly result in a
compensating re-emergence of ethics as the ordering template of society, this is a belief I don't
have room to support here. <P>

<DD>Instead, I think that, as in the case cited above, compensation for soft products will be driven
primarily by practical considerations, all of them consistent with the true properties of digital
information, where the value lies in it, and how it can be both manipulated and protected by
technology.<P> 

<DD>While the conundrum remains a conundrum, I can begin to see the directions from which solutions
may emerge, based in part on broadening those practical solutions which are already in practice.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Relationship and Its Tools</FONT><P>

<DD>I believe one idea is central to understanding liquid commerce: Information economics, in the
absence of objects, will be based more on relationship than possession.<P> 

<DD>One existing model for the future conveyance of intellectual property is real-time performance, a
medium currently used only in theater, music, lectures, stand-up comedy, and pedagogy. I believe
the concept of performance will expand to include most of the information economy, from
multicasted soap operas to stock analysis. In these instances, commercial exchange will be more
like ticket sales to a continuous show than the purchase of discrete bundles of that which is being
shown.<P> 

<DD>The other existing, model, of course, is service. The entire professional class - doctors, lawyers,
consultants, architects, and so on - are already being paid directly for their intellectual property.
Who needs copyright when you're on a retainer?<P> 

<DD>In fact, until the late 18th century this model was applied to much of what is now copyrighted.
Before the industrialization of creation, writers, composers, artists, and the like produced their
products in the private service of patrons. Without objects to distribute in a mass market, creative
people will return to a condition somewhat like this, except that they will serve many patrons,
rather than one.<P> 

<DD>We can already see the emergence of companies which base their existence on supporting and
enhancing the soft property they create rather than selling it by the shrink-wrapped piece or
embedding it in widgets. <P>

<DD>Trip Hawkins's new company for creating and licensing multimedia tools, 3DO, is an example of
what I'm talking about. 3DO doesn't intend to produce any commercial software or consumer
devices. Instead, it will act as a kind of private standards setting body, mediating among software
and device creators who will be their licensees. It will provide a point of commonality for
relationships between a broad spectrum of entities.<P> 

<DD>In any case, whether you think of yourself as a service provider or a performer, the future
protection of your intellectual property will depend on your ability to control your relationship to
the market - a relationship which will most likely live and grow over a period of time.<P> 

<DD>The value of that relationship will reside in the quality of performance, the uniqueness of your
point of view, the validity of your expertise, its relevance to your market, and, underlying
everything, the ability of that market to access your creative services swiftly, conveniently, and
interactively.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Interaction and Protection</FONT><P>

<DD>Direct interaction will provide a lot of intellectual property protection in the future, and, indeed,
already has. No one knows how many software pirates have bought legitimate copies of a program
after calling its publisher for technical support and offering some proof of purchase, but I would
guess the number is very high.<P> 

<DD>The same kind of controls will be applicable to "question and answer" relationships between
authorities (or artists) and those who seek their expertise. Newsletters, magazines, and books will
be supplemented by the ability of their subscribers to ask direct questions of authors.<P> 

<DD>Interactivity will be a billable commodity even in the absence of authorship. As people move into
the Net and increasingly get their information directly from its point of production, unfiltered by
centralized media, they will attempt to develop the same interactive ability to probe reality that only
experience has provided them in the past. Live access to these distant "eyes and ears" will be much
easier to cordon than access to static bundles of stored but easily reproducible information.<P> 

<DD>In most cases, control will be based on restricting access to the freshest, highest bandwidth
information. It will be a matter of defining the ticket, the venue, the performer, and the identity of
the ticket holder, definitions which I believe will take their forms from technology, not law. In
most cases, the defining technology will be cryptography.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Crypto Bottling</FONT><P>

<DD>Cryptography, as I've said perhaps too many times, is the "material" from which the walls,
boundaries - and bottles - of cyberspace will be fashioned.<P> 

<DD>Of course there are problems with cryptography or any other purely technical method of property
protection. It has always appeared to me that the more security you hide your goods behind, the
more likely you are to turn your sanctuary into a target. Having come from a place where people
leave their keys in their cars and don't even have keys to their houses, I remain convinced that the
best obstacle to crime is a society with its ethics intact. <P>

<DD>While I admit that this is not the kind of society most of us live in, I also believe that a social over
reliance on protection by barricades rather than conscience will eventually wither the latter by
turning intrusion and theft into a sport, rather than a crime. This is already occurring in the digital
domain as is evident in the activities of computer crackers.<P> 

<DD>Furthermore, I would argue that initial efforts to protect digital copyright by copy protection
contributed to the current condition in which most otherwise ethical computer users seem morally
untroubled by their possession of pirated software.<P> 

<DD>Instead of cultivating among the newly computerized a sense of respect for the work of their
fellows, early reliance on copy protection led to the subliminal notion that cracking into a software
package somehow "earned" one the right to use it. Limited not by conscience but by technical skill,
many soon felt free to do whatever they could get away with. This will continue to be a potential
liability of the encryption of digitized commerce.<P> 

<DD>Furthermore, it's cautionary to remember that copy protection was rejected by the market in most
areas. Many of the upcoming efforts to use cryptography-based protection schemes will probably
suffer the same fate. People are not going to tolerate much that makes computers harder to use than
they already are without any benefit to the user.<P> 

<DD>Nevertheless, encryption has already demonstrated a certain blunt utility. New subscriptions to
various commercial satellite TV services skyrocketed recently after their deployment of more robust
encryption of their feeds. This, despite a booming backwoods trade in black decoder chips,
conducted by folks who'd look more at home running moonshine than cracking code. <P>

<DD>Another obvious problem with encryption as a global solution is that once something has been
unscrambled by a legitimate licensee, it may be available to massive reproduction.<P> 

<DD>In some instances, reproduction following decryption may not be a problem. Many soft products
degrade sharply in value with time. It may be that the only real interest in such products will be
among those who have purchased the keys to immediacy.<P> 

<DD>Furthermore, as software becomes more modular and distribution moves online, it will begin to
metamorphose in direct interaction with its user base. Discontinuous upgrades will smooth into a
constant process of incremental improvement and adaptation, some of it manmade and some of it
arising through genetic algorithms. Pirated copies of software may become too static to have much
value to anyone.<P> 

<DD>Even in cases such as images, where the information is expected to remain fixed, the unencrypted
file could still be interwoven with code which could continue to protect it by a wide variety of
means.<P> 

<DD>In most of the schemes I can project, the file would be "alive" with permanently embedded
software that could "sense" the surrounding conditions and interact with them. For example, it
might contain code that could detect the process of duplication and cause it to self-destruct.<P> 

<DD>Other methods might give the file the ability to "phone home" through the Net to its original owner.
The continued integrity of some files might require periodic "feeding" with digital cash from their
host, which they would then relay back to their authors.<P> 

<DD>Of course files that possess the independent ability to communicate upstream sound uncomfortably
like the Morris Internet Worm. "Live" files do have a certain viral quality. And serious privacy
issues would arise if everyone's computer were packed with digital spies.<P> 

<DD>The point is that cryptography will enable protection technologies that will develop rapidly in the
obsessive competition that has always existed between lock-makers and lock-breakers.<P> 

<DD>But cryptography will not be used simply for making locks. It is also at the heart of both digital
signatures and the aforementioned digital cash, both of which I believe will be central to the future
protection of intellectual property.<P> 

<DD>I believe that the generally acknowledged failure of the shareware model in software had less to do
with dishonesty than with the simple inconvenience of paying for shareware. If the payment
process can be automated, as digital cash and signature will make possible, I believe that soft
product creators will reap a much higher return from the bread they cast upon the waters of
cyberspace.<P> 

<DD>Moreover, they will be spared much of the overhead presently attached to the marketing,
manufacture, sales, and distribution of information products, whether those products are computer
programs, books, CDs, or motion pictures. This will reduce prices and further increase the
likelihood of noncompulsory payment.<P> 

<DD>But of course there is a fundamental problem with a system that requires, through technology,
payment for every access to a particular expression. It defeats the original Jeffersonian purpose of
seeing that ideas were available to everyone regardless of their economic station. I am not
comfortable with a model that will restrict inquiry to the wealthy.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>An Economy of Verbs</FONT><P>

<DD>The future forms and protections of intellectual property are densely obscured at this entrance to the
Virtual Age. Nevertheless, I can make (or reiterate) a few flat statements that I earnestly believe
won't look too silly in 50 years.<P> 

       <DD>In the absence of the old containers, almost everything we think we know about
       intellectual property is wrong. We're going to have to unlearn it. We're going to have to
       look at information as though we'd never seen the stuff before. 
       The protections that we will develop will rely far more on ethics and technology than on
       law. 
       Encryption will be the technical basis for most intellectual property protection. (And
       should, for many reasons, be made more widely available.) 
       The economy of the future will be based on relationship rather than possession. It will be
       continuous rather than sequential. 
       And finally, in the years to come, most human exchange will be virtual rather than
       physical, consisting not of stuff but the stuff of which dreams are made. Our future
       business will be conducted in a world made more of verbs than nouns."</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=4><DD>"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive
       property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual
       may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is
       divulged, it forces itself into the possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot
       dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the
       less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from
       me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper
       at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from
       one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and
       improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently
       designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space,
       without lessening their density at any point, and like the air in which we breathe,
       move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive
       appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property." -<BR>
       <DD>Thomas Jefferson <P>

<DD>"Throughout the time I've been groping around cyberspace, an immense, unsolved conundrum has
remained at the root of nearly every legal, ethical, governmental, and social vexation to be found in
the Virtual World. I refer to the problem of digitized property. The enigma is this: If our property
can be infinitely reproduced and instantaneously distributed all over the planet without cost,
without our knowledge, without its even leaving our possession, how can we protect it? How are
we going to get paid for the work we do with our minds? And, if we can't get paid, what will
assure the continued creation and distribution of such work?<P> 

<DD>Since we don't have a solution to what is a profoundly new kind of challenge, and are apparently
unable to delay the galloping digitization of everything not obstinately physical, we are sailing into
the future on a sinking ship.<DD> 

<DD>This vessel, the accumulated canon of copyright and patent law, was developed to convey forms
and methods of expression entirely different from the vaporous cargo it is now being asked to
carry. It is leaking as much from within as from without.<P> 

<DD>Legal efforts to keep the old boat floating are taking three forms: a frenzy of deck chair
rearrangement, stern warnings to the passengers that if she goes down, they will face harsh
criminal penalties, and serene, glassy-eyed denial.<P> 

<DD>Intellectual property law cannot be patched, retrofitted, or expanded to contain digitized expression
any more than real estate law might be revised to cover the allocation of broadcasting spectrum
(which, in fact, rather resembles what is being attempted here). We will need to develop an entirely
new set of methods as befits this entirely new set of circumstances.<P> 

<DD>Most of the people who actually create soft property - the programmers, hackers, and Net surfers -
already know this. Unfortunately, neither the companies they work for nor the lawyers these
companies hire have enough direct experience with nonmaterial goods to understand why they are
so problematic. They are proceeding as though the old laws can somehow be made to work, either
by grotesque expansion or by force. They are wrong.<P> 

<DD>The source of this conundrum is as simple as its solution is complex. Digital technology is
detaching information from the physical plane, where property law of all sorts has always found
definition.<P> 

<DD>Throughout the history of copyrights and patents, the proprietary assertions of thinkers have been
focused not on their ideas but on the expression of those ideas. The ideas themselves, as well as
facts about the phenomena of the world, were considered to be the collective property of humanity.
One could claim franchise, in the case of copyright, on the precise turn of phrase used to convey a
particular idea or the order in which facts were presented.<P> 

<DD>The point at which this franchise was imposed was that moment when the "word became flesh" by
departing the mind of its originator and entering some physical object, whether book or widget.
The subsequent arrival of other commercial media besides books didn't alter the legal importance of
this moment. Law protected expression and, with few (and recent) exceptions, to express was to
make physical.<P> 

<DD>Protecting physical expression had the force of convenience on its side. Copyright worked well
because, Gutenberg notwithstanding, it was hard to make a book. Furthermore, books froze their
contents into a condition which was as challenging to alter as it was to reproduce. Counterfeiting
and distributing counterfeit volumes were obvious and visible activities it was easy enough to catch
somebody in the act of doing. Finally, unlike unbounded words or images, books had material
surfaces to which one could attach copyright notices, publisher's marques, and price tags.<P> 

<DD>Mental-to-physical conversion was even more central to patent. A patent, until recently, was either
a description of the form into which materials were to be rendered in the service of some purpose,
or a description of the process by which rendition occurred. In either case, the conceptual heart of
patent was the material result. If no purposeful object could be rendered because of some material
limitation, the patent was rejected. Neither a Klein bottle nor a shovel made of silk could be
patented. It had to be a thing, and the thing had to work.<P> 

<DD>Thus, the rights of invention and authorship adhered to activities in the physical world. One didn't
get paid for ideas, but for the ability to deliver them into reality. For all practical purposes, the
value was in the conveyance and not in the thought conveyed.<P> 

<DD>In other words, the bottle was protected, not the wine.<P> 

<DD>Now, as information enters cyberspace, the native home of Mind, these bottles are vanishing. With
the advent of digitization, it is now possible to replace all previous information storage forms with
one metabottle: complex and highly liquid patterns of ones and zeros.<P> 

<DD>Even the physical/digital bottles to which we've become accustomed floppy disks, CD-ROMs, and
other discrete, shrink-wrappable bit-packages will disappear as all computers jack-in to the global
Net. While the Internet may never include every CPU on the planet, it is more than doubling every
year and can be expected to become the principal medium of information conveyance, and perhaps
eventually, the only one.<P> 

<DD>Once that has happened, all the goods of the Information Age - all of the expressions once
contained in books or film strips or newsletters - will exist either as pure thought or something very
much like thought: voltage conditions darting around the Net at the speed of light, in conditions that
one might behold in effect, as glowing pixels or transmitted sounds, but never touch or claim to
"own" in the old sense of the word.<P> 

<DD>Some might argue that information will still require some physical manifestation, such as its
magnetic existence on the titanic hard disks of distant servers, but these are bottles which have no
macroscopically discrete or personally meaningful form.<P> 

<DD>Some will also argue that we have been dealing with unbottled expression since the advent of
radio, and they would be right. But for most of the history of broadcast, there was no convenient
way to capture soft goods from the electromagnetic ether and reproduce them with quality available
in commercial packages. Only recently has this changed, and little has been done legally or
technically to address the change.<P> 

<DD>Generally, the issue of consumer payment for broadcast products was irrelevant. The consumers
themselves were the product. Broadcast media were supported either by the sale of the attention of
their audience to advertisers, by government assessing payment through taxes, or by the whining
mendicancy of annual donor drives.<P> 

<DD>All of the broadcast-support models are flawed. Support either by advertisers or government has
almost invariably tainted the purity of the goods delivered. Besides, direct marketing is gradually
killing the advertiser-support model anyway. <P>

<DD>Broadcast media gave us another payment method for a virtual product: the royalties that
broadcasters pay songwriters through such organizations as ASCAP and BMI. But, as a member
of ASCAP, I can assure you this is not a model that we should emulate. The monitoring methods
are wildly approximate. There is no parallel system of accounting in the revenue stream. It doesn't
really work. Honest.<P> 

<DD>In any case, without our old methods, based on physically defining the expression of ideas, and in
the absence of successful new models for nonphysical transaction, we simply don't know how to
assure reliable payment for mental works. To make matters worse, this comes at a time when the
human mind is replacing sunlight and mineral deposits as the principal source of new wealth.<P> 

<DD>Furthermore, the increasing difficulty of enforcing existing copyright and patent laws is already
placing in peril the ultimate source of intellectual property - the free exchange of ideas.<P> 

<DD>That is, when the primary articles of commerce in a society look so much like speech as to be
indistinguishable from it, and when the traditional methods of protecting their ownership have
become ineffectual, attempting to fix the problem with broader and more vigorous enforcement will
inevitably threaten freedom of speech. The greatest constraint on your future liberties may come not
from government but from corporate legal departments laboring to protect by force what can no
longer be protected by practical efficiency or general social consent.<P> 

<DD>Furthermore, when Jefferson and his fellow creatures of the Enlightenment designed the system
that became American copyright law, their primary objective was assuring the widespread
distribution of thought, not profit. Profit was the fuel that would carry ideas into the libraries and
minds of their new republic. Libraries would purchase books, thus rewarding the authors for their
work in assembling ideas; these ideas, otherwise "incapable of confinement," would then become
freely available to the public. But what is the role of libraries in the absence of books? How does
society now pay for the distribution of ideas if not by charging for the ideas themselves?<P> 

<DD>Additionally complicating the matter is the fact that along with the disappearance of the physical
bottles in which intellectual property protection has resided, digital technology is also erasing the
legal jurisdictions of the physical world and replacing them with the unbounded and perhaps
permanently lawless waves of cyberspace.<P> 

<DD>In cyberspace, no national or local boundaries contain the scene of a crime and determine the
method of its prosecution; worse, no clear cultural agreements define what a crime might be.
Unresolved and basic differences between Western and Asian cultural assumptions about
intellectual property can only be exacerbated when many transactions are taking place in both
hemispheres and yet, somehow, in neither.<P> 

<DD>Even in the most local of digital conditions, jurisdiction and responsibility are hard to assess. A
group of music publishers filed suit against CompuServe this fall because it allowed its users to
upload musical compositions into areas where other users might access them. But since
CompuServe cannot practically exercise much control over the flood of bits that passes between its
subscribers, it probably shouldn't be held responsible for unlawfully "publishing" these works.<P> 

<DD>Notions of property, value, ownership, and the nature of wealth itself are changing more
fundamentally than at any time since the Sumerians first poked cuneiform into wet clay and called it
stored grain. Only a very few people are aware of the enormity of this shift, and fewer of them are
lawyers or public officials.<P> 

<DD>Those who do see these changes must prepare responses for the legal and social confusion that will
erupt as efforts to protect new forms of property with old methods become more obviously futile,
and, as a consequence, more adamant..."<P></FONT>

Archive X is a series of Web pages devoted towards Paranormal Phenomena.
It is a portion of
<a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html">The
<b>Virtual Library</b></a>.
Information is gathered from various news groups as well as submissions from
interested parties and case histories from officially documented hauntings
and paranormal activities.
<P>
Archive X was created by
Brandon Gillespie (brandon@paradise.declab.usu.edu), and maintained by him
through 1994 and part of 1995.
<p>
<b>Disclaimer</b>: Because information may exist in this listing does
not mean I personally endorse it nor believe it.  I am simply creating an
archive of other's experiences as they recounted or were recorded.
<p>
Welcome to the new look of Archive X.  The index page was getting very
large, so I decided to change things around.  If you are keyed to receive
changes to Archive X, this will not change.  Check the recent change block

<p>
Stories archived have a header line of <tt>Location:</tt>,
<tt>Subject:</tt> and
<tt>Story-type:</tt> which specify the Location the events took place
(this is an optional field), a Subject name for the story, and what type of
Story it is, using the following guidelines:
<ul>
 <li>If it is folklore specify such in this field.  In this instance
 folklore is considered any Ghost Story which is not a personal
 experience or that which is the personal experience of a close
 friend.  Any further removed (such as a story from a friend
 who had a friend) is considered folklore.

 <li>Specify it further by dividing it between a Haunting (a series
 of encounters or a resident ghost) or single encounters.

 <li>If it is an Angel Story, specify such in this field.

 <li>If it is a Channeling, specify such, and include the overall
      subject of the channeling.

 <li>feel free to embellish this field to explain the story.
</ul>

Only stories including these two headers will be archived.
<p>
I reserve the right to refuse any story for any reason and to edit any
story submitted (although I always contact the author before finalizing
any changes).

<!-- default size --><b>Fern Schair</b> announced last week she will retire in June as executive secretary and chief administrative officer of the City Bar, positions she has held for 15 years. She is only the third person to serve as the association's executive secretary. City Bar President Michael A. Cardozo said ''her dedication to public service and hard work, in combination with an inexhaustible font of creative energy, has played an integral role'' in the association's growth. In her tenure, membership rose to 21,000 from 13,000, committees increased to more than 180 from 118, and there was significant growth in the number of women and minority members.<!-- dont clear default size --></p>

<p><!-- default size --><b>The Supreme Court </b>agreed Friday to review the appeal of an Illinois death row inmate whose murder trial was presided over by a state judge later convicted for taking bribes to fix other cases. The Court said it will decide whether William Bracy, convicted of three 1980 shooting deaths in Chicago, should get another chance to establish that he was denied a trial before an impartial judge,<i> Bracy v. Gramley, </i>96-6133.<i> </i>He contends he was denied a fair trial before former Cook County Judge Thomas Maloney, who was convicted in 1993 of taking bribes to fix cases before him, including two murder trials that ended in acquittals.<!-- dont clear default size --></p>
<p><!-- default size --><b>Drug offenders </b>made up almost one-third of the 872,200 felons convicted in state courts nationwide during 1994, the Justice Department reported over the weekend. Property crimes accounted for another third of the convicted felons, and violent crimes for about a fifth. The number of state convictions in 1994 declined from 1992 (893,600) but was higher than in 1988 (667,400), when the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics first conducted this biennial survey. In 1994, 89 percent of convicted state felons pleaded guilty; 45 percent were sentenced to prison. The average sentence was 6-1/2 years, and the time served was about 2 years.</p>

They argued that it was not a ''motor vehicle'' under &#167;125 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and thus they could not be vicariously liable under &#167;388.

<h1 align=center>The E-Learn Project</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2>Three years ago, Chicago-Kent College of Law (Kent)  undertook to bring technology into the study of  law.  The experiment began with a small group of first year law students.  Each student in the section was  required to have a notebook computer.  The goals of the program were, and still are, to improve the quality of legal education, and to introduce students to the technology that is reshaping legal practice.  The E-Learn project, now in its third year, is an experiment in integration - the integration of technology into the study of law.

<P>Peter Martin, co-director of the <a href=http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu>Legal 
Information Institute</A> at Cornell Law School was a visiting professor 
at Chicago-Kent in the 1995-1996 academic year.  As part of his visit he prepared a paper on the ELEARN section called <a href=http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/papers/kentrptf.htm>What Do Law Students with Laptops and Electronic 
Casebooks Do? - The Chicago-Kent Computer Section 
(1995-96)</A>. 

<h2>The Mechanics of E-Learn</h2>
<p>The students in the E-Learn section are volunteers, and the
number admitted is limited to one section (roughly 100 students). 
At no time are the students compelled to conform to the models we
make use of.  They are required to have a laptop computer, and
the necessary hardware to connect to the school's network,
typically, an Ethernet PCMCIA card.  While the CLC suggests
vendors, there are no purchasing requirements beyond minimum
system requirements (e.g.  a 486 processor with 16 MB of RAM). 
The CLC technical staff configures the laptops and their PCMCIA
cards for connecting to the school's network.  While Kent has not
yet done so, hardware conflicts betwen PCMCIA cards, computers,
and the network argue strongly for limiting the range of
permissible Ethernet cards.
<p>The software students need to participate is relatively
inexpensive.  The centerpieces of the project are Folio VIEWS and
West's PREMISE.  Both packages are free to the students - VIEWS
comes with the Lexis research software (which is also free to
students), and PREMISE comes with the electronic versions of West's texts.  Students, of course, need to have word processing software, and they also all typically purchase the software necessary for dial-in access to Kent's network.  
<p>The students are required to purchase all of their texts in normal hard copy formats.  Some publishers provide an electronic version for an additional charge.  Where the publisher does not do so, the CLC has in some cases obtained permission to construct an electronic version of the text.  In other cases, faculty members have built their own electronic casebooks. 

<h2>Why Take Part?</h2>

<p>The first major benefit of taking part in the program is an immersion in technology. The program offers substantial training in the use of the technology both early on and throughout the year to reduce the time it takes the students to become adept at using the technology.
<p>The other major benefit is that E-Learn exposes students to new
ways of organizing material; and organization is a major part of
the study of law! E-Learn students are trained in using a variety
of computer tools to synthesize their texts, research, notes and
outlines into a manageable source of information.  The ultimate
goal is for the student to find ways to connect, via the software
on her computer, the electronic text to her notes, to her
outlines, to related research instantaneously.  The electronic
student is able to filter information into different schemes at
the touch of a button.  She can cross-reference material in one
source to several other sources without swapping books and
rifling through papers.  By freeing the student from the physical
processes involved in research and writing, and by streamlining
the research and writing processes, the computer can allow the
student to focus more energy on synthesizing and analyzing the
material.
<p>But there are drawbacks inherent to the project.  The first is
that the student must learn the technology to be able to use it. 
This can take time.  Unfortunately, the law student is not
endowed with copious amounts of free time.  Therefore, the E-Learn student must divide her energies between law and technology
until she becomes capable of using the technology.  Despite all
our efforts to minimize this effect, we can't eliminate it. 
Fortunately we have found students quite adept at managing this
task - even the self-proclaimed beginners!
<p>Another drawback is that computer use necessarily involves
computers, and computers break.  The world of hardware and
software problems that arise with any computer are magnified by
the level of use the typical E-Learn student makes of her
computer.  Again though, the program has a highly skilled staff
that devotes much of its energy to assuring that these problems
don't disrupt the student's education.  And it does so with an
admirable level of success.
<p>The other drawback is that students spend a lot of time
reading off their computer screens, and this can put a strain on
the eyes.  It is not uncommon for students to find themselves
reading cases out of their paper texts.  Hopefully, as the
technology improves it will be easier on the eyes to read off the
computer.

<h2>The Students' Role</h2>
<p>The final piece to the puzzle is the students' responsibility
to the program.  Every effort  is made to keep this as low as
possible, but there are times when we need the students to assist
us.  Generally this comes in the form of surveys.  Since the
E-Learn project is experimental, for it to have a lasting value we
need to learn from it.  What we learn we learn from the
thoughtful responses we receive from the E-Learn students to our
surveys.  We are constantly working to generate more feedback
both to improve the program, and to feed the program's education.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Every day that passes brings new technological challenges to
the law student and the attorney.  It is our hope that we can
continue to keep our students informed and prepared for these
challenges.  And that's the ultimate goal of the E-Learn project. 
We think it is an important mission, and hope that the students
who take part agree!
<p>One very important element of the E-Learn program is
communication, so we actively encourage dialog.  If in reading
this you have comments, questions or concerns, please feel free
to contact the CLC - and this goes if you're a student, or just a
visitor!  Thanks!

The International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court, is located in the Hague (Netherlands). It is the supreme judicial body of the United Nations. The Court was founded in 1946 to replace the Permanent Court of International Justice.  Since 1946, the ICJ has presided over 96 Cases, 60 Judgments, 23 Advisory Opinions and 290 Orders. <P>

This site offers the text of the official judgments, advisory opinions, and orders which are received directly from the International Court of Justice. The decisions are published in English and French, the two official languages of the Court. <BR>

<p><h2>A.  United States Advertising Law</h2>
<dl>


<dt><b>1.  Fundamental Advertising Principles</b><dd>At the heart of advertising law 
in the United States are three basic doctrines:  Ad Substantiation,
Deception, and Unfairness.  The full text of the Federal Trade Commission's 1984 <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.webcom.com/~lewrose/adsubpol.html"> Policy Statement on Advertising Substantiation</a>
is the first document that should be reviewed by advertisers and marketers.
The <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.webcom.com/lewrose/deceptionpol.html">Deception Policy Statement</a> was issued
by the FTC to outline the the agency's definition of "deceptive acts or
practices" prohibited by Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15
U.S.C. section 45.  The <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.webcom.com/lewrose/unfairpol.html">Unfairness Policy Statement</a>
was issued by the FTC to define the scope of the FTC's jurisdiction to
prohibit unfair acts or practices.  Congress recently codified the FTC's
unfairness policy statement in the <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.webcom.com/lewrose/article/1994ftc.html">1994 
Amendments to the FTC Act</a>.

<H1><img src="http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/icons/dla.gif" alt=""> Directory of Legal Academia</H1>

Welcome to the Directory of Legal Academia.  The DLA 
is a directory of Law Professors and Law Librarians in
American Law Schools.  It aims to mirror the AALS <I>Directory
of Law Teachers</I>.<P>

<UL>
<LI><a href="gopher://ns.law.cornell.edu:105/2">Search the directory</A> (via the gopher hack)
<LI><a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/dla/csoform.html">Search the directory</A> (via HTML forms gateway)
</UL>

We are interested in making the directory as comprehensive as
possible.  To that end, we are willing to accept third-party
information ("I see you don't have Jane's e-mail address....it's
jane@somewhere.edu"), but we will verify it with the individual before
posting.  We are also interested in receiving batch updates or
additions from postmasters at law school sites.<P>

To further that objective, we have hacked the server so that
a designated user or <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/dla/proxyhero/"><I>"proxyhero"</I></A>,
may make changes/additions/deletions to the directory for a
particular insitution.<P>

<BR CLEAR>&nbsp;
<P>Welcome to <B>Oyez Oyez Oyez: A Supreme Court WWW Resource</B> (or <b>Oyez</b> -- pronounced "oh-yay" --
for short.)  Our objective is to provide information
about major constitutional cases heard and decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. 
In addition to details
about the questions and opinions in these cases, we shall
provide digital recordings of the Court's proceedings. The Court began to record its public sessions in October 1955. 
You can expect to see hundreds of cases on this web site -- and listen to hundreds of hours of digital audio --
as we build our project.
 We are digitizing these recordings
of oral arguments and opinion announcements
from sources in the National Archives. We will serve them to you as <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.realaudio.com/">
RealAudio</A>, including many files in RealAudio 2.0 format. We shall also add files in the latest RealAudio 3.0
format, which should improve playback quality significantly. Be sure you have 
the <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.realaudio.com/products/player/index.html">latest RealAudio software!</A>
<P>
Visit our site often. We will post new materials regularly.  See <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://oyez.at.nwu.edu:80/whats-new.html">"What's New"</A> for
details.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><BIG>Request for help</BIG></FONT>: We are producing a show about "how
things work" for The Learning Channel and are looking for studies done on
artificial lighting, the invention of the light bulb and how it effected human
behavior (ie/sleep vs waking hours). Would you have any reserach on this subject
or would you please lead us in the right direction? We thank you in advance for
your kind assistance.  Our e mail address is <a href="mailto:moviedog@aol.com">moviedog@aol.com</a>.

<P>This booklet, &quot;<a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.livelinks.com:80/sumeria/politics/shadv3.html">SHADOW OF THE SWASTIKA</a>:
The Real Reason the Government Won't Debate Medical Cannabis and Industrial Hemp
Re-legalization&quot;, may be the single most important document in Sumeria.
It is an Open Letter to All Americans By <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.ka.net/randy/"> R.
William Davis</A> which provides <B>Important documented evidence of a Secret
Business and Political Alliance between the U.S. Corporate
&quot;Establishment&quot; and the Nazis</B>. It shows how this alliance was
formed before World War II and, more importantly, how it continued during and
after the War into the Nixon and Bush presidencies and beyond....

<p>The booklet is specially important because it ties together much
of Sumeria's other material - material on such diverse topics as <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.livelinks.com:80/sumeria/politics/hemp.html"> The War on Hemp</a> (aka Marijuana), <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.livelinks.com:80/sumeria/npoi1.html">Aspartame</a>, <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.livelinks.com:80/sumeria/politics/trilat.html">The Tri-Lateral

I am pleased to announce that the U.S. Air Force has agreed to release a 
historic file of Supreme Court decisions from its FLITE ("Federal Legal Information Through Electronics") system. The file consists of over 7000 Supreme Court opinions dating from 1937 through 1975, from volumes 300 through 422 of U.S. Reports.
<P>
This file had previously been determined to be exempt from release under the 
Freedom of Information Act by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  That decision was not appealed.  Nonetheless, the Air Force has agreed as a matter of discretion to release these materials.

<P>
This system contains the full text of 7,407 U.S. Supreme Court Decisions from 1937 to 1975.  Decisions are avialable as ASCII text files that can be read on your browser's screen or saved to your hard drive and accessed by using most word processor programs.  Most Decisions are very large and may take a while to download if you have a slow internet connection.  After conducting a search, the search results screen lists the size of the Decision in bytes so that you can esimate download times.
<P>
Currently available search strategies are simple.  We expect that most users will know the case name of the decision they need and will most likely use the Case Name search option.  Otherwise, you may use the full text search option, but beware that the size of the database and the number of words (14.5 million) may require that conduct a number of searches to find what you are looking for.
<P>
You may currently use two different methods to search and retrieve decisions:

<P>
Welcome to the United States Code, generated from the most recent version
of the Government Printing Office CD-ROM. It contains the laws in force as
of <B>26 January 1994</B>. <I>[For guidance on how to determine if a particular
part of the Code has since been amended <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/lexicon/uscode.html">click
here</A>.]</I>
<P>
Below is a listing of all Titles. There are six ways to access information
in the Code:
<UL>
  <LI>
    via <a href="#HEADINGS">a search of all headings in the Code</A>.  
This can be the fastest way to look for a particular topic or law for 
which you know a keyword.
  <LI>
    via <a href="#TITLES">a listing of all Titles</A>
  <LI>
    via <a href ="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/uscode/topn/">the Table of Popular Names</A>, which contains the
    popular names of many laws (eg. the <I>Mann Act</I>)
  <LI>
    via <a href="#SECTIONS">a form which permits you to look up specific
    sections</A>. This is particularly useful if you have a cite (eg. <I>14 USC
    1225</I>)
  <LI>
    via our new <a href="#fastlook"> fast search feature</A>. This offers faster
    searching than our old waisindex version (still offered).
  <LI>
    via a <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/uscode/waisindex?">full text search</A> of the Code. Note that words
    that appear more than 20,000 times (such as chapter) are filtered out by
    WAIS.
  <LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Note that the United States Code is a VERY large document. &nbsp;It is
much faster -- and kinder to other users of the system -- if you limit your
text searches to a particular area (Title) of the Code. &nbsp;To do so, go
first to the <a href="#TITLES">listing of all Titles</A> and choose the Title
you want; then, use the text-search link on the overview page for that Title
to do your search.</I>
<P>
There are still a few things <a href ="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/uscode/todo.html">to do</A>. Please email
<a href ="mailto:webmaster@www.law.cornell.edu">our webmaster</A> with errors,
problems, or concerns about the Code. 
  <HR>
<a name=SECTIONS></A>
<H2>
  <a name=SECTIONS>Find US Code Materials by Title and Section</A>
</H2>
<P>
If you know the citation for the US Code material you want to find, fill
in the title and section numbers below. (eg. <I>22 USC 1501</I> would be
Title <B>22</B>, Section <B>1501</B>). You need to fill in both title and
section.

<P>
We now offer a search interface to the Code which is based on the Harvest
system, and we strongly encourage you to use it. Not only does it run a little
faster than the older WAIS-based version, it presents search results in a
way which gives you a better idea of what you've found.
<P>
<I>Of course, it is faster still to search only a <a href="#TITLES">particular
title </A>of the Code if you already know roughly where to look</I>

<P>
<I>Some search tips and tricks:</I>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Phrase searches (eg. "income tax") should be entered in quotes.
  <LI>
    You can do boolean searches, but you must capitalize AND and OR, eg. <B>issuer
    AND stock OR securities</B>
  <LI>
    You can search for code sections by popular name. To find the Black Lung
    Benefits Act of 1972 , say<BR>
    <B>popname:"black lung"</B>
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><a name=HEADINGS>Search headings in the Code</A></H2>
You can get more relevant results more quickly by searching only the 
headings of the various sections of the Code.  This is especially true 
when you're searching for laws related to a particular concept or group 
of people, which may be scattered throughout the code.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court, is located in the Hague (Netherlands). It is the supreme judicial body of the United Nations. The Court was founded in 1946 to replace the Permanent Court of International Justice.  Since 1946, the ICJ has presided over 96 Cases, 60 Judgments, 23 Advisory Opinions and 290 Orders. <P>

This site offers the text of the official judgments, advisory opinions, and orders which are received directly from the International Court of Justice. The decisions are published in English and French, the two official languages of the Court. <BR>

<P>
Welcome to the United States Code, generated from the most recent version
of the Government Printing Office CD-ROM. It contains the laws in force as
of <B>26 January 1994</B>. <I>[For guidance on how to determine if a particular
part of the Code has since been amended <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/lexicon/uscode.html">click
here</A>.]</I>
<P>
Below is a listing of all Titles. There are six ways to access information
in the Code:
<UL>
  <LI>
    via <a href="#HEADINGS">a search of all headings in the Code</A>.  
This can be the fastest way to look for a particular topic or law for 
which you know a keyword.
  <LI>
    via <a href="#TITLES">a listing of all Titles</A>
  <LI>
    via <a href ="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/uscode/topn/">the Table of Popular Names</A>, which contains the
    popular names of many laws (eg. the <I>Mann Act</I>)
  <LI>
    via <a href="#SECTIONS">a form which permits you to look up specific
    sections</A>. This is particularly useful if you have a cite (eg. <I>14 USC
    1225</I>)
  <LI>
    via our new <a href="#fastlook"> fast search feature</A>. This offers faster
    searching than our old waisindex version (still offered).
  <LI>
    via a <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/uscode/waisindex?">full text search</A> of the Code. Note that words
    that appear more than 20,000 times (such as chapter) are filtered out by
    WAIS.
  <LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Note that the United States Code is a VERY large document. &nbsp;It is
much faster -- and kinder to other users of the system -- if you limit your
text searches to a particular area (Title) of the Code. &nbsp;To do so, go
first to the <a href="#TITLES">listing of all Titles</A> and choose the Title
you want; then, use the text-search link on the overview page for that Title
to do your search.</I>
<P>
There are still a few things <a href ="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/uscode/todo.html">to do</A>. Please email
<a href ="mailto:webmaster@www.law.cornell.edu">our webmaster</A> with errors,
problems, or concerns about the Code. 
  <HR>
<a name=SECTIONS></A>
<H2>
  <a name=SECTIONS>Find US Code Materials by Title and Section</A>
</H2>
<P>
If you know the citation for the US Code material you want to find, fill
in the title and section numbers below. (eg. <I>22 USC 1501</I> would be
Title <B>22</B>, Section <B>1501</B>). You need to fill in both title and
section.

</H2>
<P>
We now offer a search interface to the Code which is based on the Harvest
system, and we strongly encourage you to use it. Not only does it run a little
faster than the older WAIS-based version, it presents search results in a
way which gives you a better idea of what you've found.
<P>
<I>Of course, it is faster still to search only a <a href="#TITLES">particular
title </A>of the Code if you already know roughly where to look</I>

<P>
<I>Some search tips and tricks:</I>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Phrase searches (eg. "income tax") should be entered in quotes.
  <LI>
    You can do boolean searches, but you must capitalize AND and OR, eg. <B>issuer
    AND stock OR securities</B>
  <LI>
    You can search for code sections by popular name. To find the Black Lung
    Benefits Act of 1972 , say<BR>
    <B>popname:"black lung"</B>
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><a name=HEADINGS>Search headings in the Code</A></H2>
You can get more relevant results more quickly by searching only the 
headings of the various sections of the Code.  This is especially true 
when you're searching for laws related to a particular concept or group 
of people, which may be scattered throughout the code.

These new search tools are easier to use.

Just a quick note to say thanks for this great service!..... 
<P>
Just to let you know, I'm a reporter and stumbled across your press release database for story I'm writing about mineral
exploration. I've bookmarked the page, it's a great place to get a quick
snapshot of what a company has been up to over the past year or two. Very
handy....
<P>
<b>August 13, 1996 - <i> J. Haman</i> - Canada</b>

The service your company provides - in particular the e-mail distribution of

I've been surfing for business reference sites for quite some time now,
and honestly yours has the best interface so far.  As far as content is
concerned, it looks good so far.
<P>
Is this subsidized by the government?  I grew up in BC, and now working
in Asia.  Its nice to see this kind of intelligent service on the net.<br>
Good job guys.
<P>
<b>July 9 1996 - <i>C. Michels</i> - Ontario, Canada</b>
<P>
Hello Folks !<br>
I've been using your service for the last month or so and find it useful
for notifying me on news specific information, especially as the local
media is usually 'delayed' somewhat in Thunder Bay and I don't have
time to read the Globe & Mail at the end of the day. 
<P>
<b>July 4 1996 - <I> A. Becker</i> - British Columbia, Canada</b>
<P>
Hi,  I found CCN YESTERDAY AND AM VERY IMPRESSED, KEEP UP THE GOOD 
WORK.<br>
Your "Hot off the wire " service sounds like the way to go for me
 I look forward to checking in often.
<P>
<b>July 1 1996 - <I>Diarmuid</i> - Ireland</b>

I'm a banking journalist, and I absolutely LOVE the concept.<br>
Keep up the good work
<P>
<b>June 25 1996 - <I> W. Wong</i> - British Columbia, Canada</b>
<P>
This site is extremely well thought out.  Fast and also comprehensive in information.  I
really like the idea of sending news releases to e-mail free of charge.  I used <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.newswire.ca">Canada
NewsWire</a> and was disappointed by its inability to provide timely information.
<P>
<b>June 22 1996 - <I> E. Olaiver</i> - Ontario, Canada</b>
<P>
Greetings CCN-News:
<P>
I have written to you previous e-mails concerning the quality of you home webpage.  Now that I
have logged on since several weeks of miscue, I like what I see.
<P>
Little graphics, but good use of colors.  Lots of texts that would definitely appeal to those
who wish for news and not glamour.  I applaud you in your compromise of graphics and text.
<P>
It is important to appeal not only to those who like flashy headlines, but to those who like
straight to the point information with no deviation.
<P>
Keep up the good work!
<P>
<b>June 18 1996 - <I> R. Martijn</i> - Prince Edward Island, Canada</b>
<P>
We are in contact with as many as 10 companies a week via fax asking them
for information.  If a search of CCN indicates that they are not a client,
we have begun to mention CCN as an efficient and effective way to get their
news to the people they want.  We've even inserted the URL for the page on
the service CCN provides and the rates.
<P>
We make it clear that we have no affiliation with CCN and that it is not a
solicitation, only a suggestion.
<P>
As I said, I'm impressed by your efforts and by putting in a plug for CCN I
firmly believe that we're helping the corporation in question and ourselves.
The fact that CCN also benefits is just a result of the good service you provide.
<P>
Just trying to spread the word of your good service!
<P>
<b>June 11 1996 - <I> N. Kennedy</i> - unknown location</b>
<P>
You have improved your product immensely with these changes. I wish
more people would realise that function is far more important than
fancy time consuming graphics.
<P>
Congratulations. I'll continue to use the systems..
<P>
<b>June 6 1996 - <i>D. Boutilier</i> - Nova Scotia, Canada</b>

<P>
<b>May 22 1996 - <i>D. Whitman</i> - USA</b>
<P>
I just found this web page. Being out of Country can be difficult - lack of
Canadian news! I'm very happy with the info I'm getting here.
<P>
<b>May 22 1996 - <i>S. Vazquez</i> - Ontario, Canada</b>
<P>
I wanted to congratulate you on your fine news service. I find the week
in review especially useful.....
<P>
Once again thank you for your fine job.
<P>
<b>May 19 1996 - <I> D. Robertson</i> - Ontario, Canada</b>

investment advisory business.
<P>
<b>May 2 1996 - <i>W. Bignell</i> - Ontario, Canada</b>
<P>
I read about your service in the Canadian Shareholders magazine.<br>
What a wonderful service! I have placed a "bookmark" on my Netscape,
and this is now the first place I go when I log in.
<P>
Do you have a "corporate profile" section, or know of such a thing?<br>
Either way, keep up the fine work..... it is truly excellent!
<P>
<b>April 27 1996 - <i>W. Reichenbacher</i> - unknown location</b>
<P>
Living out in the boonies where there is no newspaper,made
Hot Off the Wire the greatest thing since sliced bread.
<P>
<b>April 24 1996 - <i>S. Chang</i> - Ontario, Canada</b>
<P>
Thanks for the quick response! I found the 'Hot of the Wire' e-mail delivery
service is extremely helpful, especially, information posted by those small-cap companies.<br>
Excellent work!
<P>
<b>April 17 1996 - <i>D. Petricola</i> - Ontario, Canada</b>
<P>
I would like to take this moment to congratulate and thank you for the
wonderful way in which you have changed the appearance and presentation
of your news releases....reducing the print size, and leaving a space
between the releases makes reading the releases so much easier and 
quicker. I also like the idea of identifying your releases by the Company 
ticker symbol, and the month and day of release. This makes 
downloading of the release fast and the file is readily identifiable by 
its filename. Keep up your great service. Thank you.
<P>
<b>April 17 1996 - <i>R. Stephens</i> - California, USA</b>
<P>
Could you please tell Kenrich Mining (V-KRC) to use your service.  Its
wonderful, informative and I just love it.
<P>
<b>April 15 1996 - <i>B. Chyplyk</i> - British Columbia, Canada</b>
 <P>
Just a note to thank you for this great service! This concept of keeping
abreast of news is timely and second to none!
<P>
I consider your service and support to be one of the best available on
the Internet. Congratulations and keep up the good work!
<P>
<b>April 11 1996 - <i> B. Diggle</i> - Ontario, Canada</b>
<P>    
YOUR SERVICE IS FANTASTIC!!! I have been searching the "net" for a
comparable service for the US Stocks I'm interested in but have found
nothing. There are lots of site where I can pay for press releases but
none, where the company pays and I get them free.
<P>
You should consider setting up an "American Corporate News", twinning the
service you already provide.
<P>
<b>April 10 1996 - <i>V. Escobar</i> - Ontario, Canada</b>
<P>
Just thought I'd drop a note of thanks and congratulations.  I've
recently gotten 'connected' and have been touring many investment related
sites, specially Canadian.  Yours is definitely one of the best.
<P>
Keep up the good work.
<P>
<b>April 9 1996 - <i>G.</i></b>
<P>
I am a 12-year-old student from Toronto, ON, and I was delighted to see the
amount of information on TV violence.  I'm doing a presentation on the
subject and with all this information I should have no problem with doing so.
 Thank you very much.  Keep up the good work.
<P>
<b>April 2 1996 - <i>J. Aronson</i></b>
<P> 
I look forward to receiving the automatic e-mail about your companies.  AATA
International, Inc. is an environmental consultancy specializing in
international environmental management and permitting.  Many of your
participating companies are our clients, and we look forward to getting the
news hot off the wire!  Thanks for putting this neat service together.
<P>
<B>January 4 1996 - <i>D. Deadlock</i> - Saskatchewan, Canada</b>
<P>
By the way, I think your company offers an excellent service.  I have seen several releases that are 
not even picked up by brokers monitoring "Stockwatch" until the following day.

<H1>Search U.S. Supreme Court Syllabi</H1>
This index allows you to search all Supreme Court decisions
archived at the Case Western Reserve ftp site (ftp.cwru.edu).
(It does not, therefore, reach decisions prior to May 1990.)
Indexed here are the Court prepared summaries of those decisions
(syllabi).<p>

This index was last updated Jul  8 05:24:23 1996.<p>

Searches may consist of:<ul>
<li>single words, e.g.: copyright
<li>combinations of words that you want all decisions
	to include, e.g.: copyright and fair and use
<li>combinations of words that are alternatives, where you
	  want decisions using either, e.g.: forfeit or forfeiture
<li>ranges of words that are alternatives, where you
	  want decisions within the range, e.g.: forfeit-forfeiture
<li>words that operate to exclude, e.g.: forfeiture not 1993
</ul>
Searches return hypertext documents that provide point and
click access to all opinions in cases satisfying the terms
of the search, i.e., syllabus, majority opinion plus
any concurring and dissenting opinions.<p>

<H2>What is the Legal Information Institute?</H2>
<P>The Legal Information Institute at the Cornell Law School (or LII) was established in July 1992 by Peter Martin and Tom Bruce.  The Insitute aims to explore new ways of distributing legal documents and commentary.  Like the law journals published at th
e school the LII draws upon faculty, staff, and student resources.  However, its publications all take an electronic form.  The LII's two primary activities -- the distribution of course supplements on disk in a hypertextual format, and the dissemination 
of legal information via the Internet -- have led to a variety of related activities all having to do with computer-based dissemination of or communcation about law.
<P>Critical start-up support for the Institute was furnished by the <a  href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.vill.edu/ncair/ncair.html">National Center for 
Automated Information Research</A> and <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/admit/admit.htm">Cornell Law 
School</A>.  Both continue to support the Institute.  They have been joined by a growing number of corporate 
sponsors.  Sponsors of the LII's work during 1995-96 include: <UL>

<LI><a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.westpub.com/">West Publishing Co.</A>
</UL>
<P>In addition, the Institute's ongoing development of <a  href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/disks96.html#ethics">materials in the

<a name=LII><H4>What is the Legal Information Institute?</H4></A>
The Legal Information Institute (LII) is a research and electronic publishing activity of the Cornell Law School, founded in 1992 by co-directors Thomas R. Bruce and Peter W. Martin.  Its work is supported by  the National Center for Automated Information Research, a <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/lii.html">growing number of corporate sponsors</A>, and the Keck Foundation through grants and funded joint studies.<P>
The Institute publishes electronic versions of core materials in numerous areas of the law on diskette -- ranging from the Constitution to the Uniform Commercial Code.  It maintains this Internet site and its many resources.  It builds software tools assisting Internet users and publishers, most notably Cello, the Internet browser.  And through workshops and consultation it works to aid others who want to explore the full potential of electronic publication and communication.<P>
Why has Cornell Law School established such a program and what kinds of activities has the Institute undertaken, both on the Internet and via other electronic means?  For more on these and related questions, <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/lii/lii.overview.html">click here</A><P>
<a name=important><H4>Some of Most Heavily Used Internet Publications Accessed Via This Server</H4></A>
<H5>The Supreme Court, Its Decisions, and the U.S. Constitution</H5>
Since May of 1990, the Supreme Court has released its decisions to the Internet.  While they are archived on a computer in Cleveland (at Case Western Reserve), access via the LII server allows searching for decisions by party name or by topic and yields a full print reference for the case.  <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/supct.table.html">Click here for the LII's hypertext front-end to recent Supreme Court decisions.</A>  The LII also offers a growing collection of <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cases/historic.htm">selected historic decisions</A>.<P>
The LII server also offers the U.S. Constitution [<a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html">click here</A>], and biographical material on all members of the Supreme Court (including links to the recent opinions written by each justice) [<a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/supct/justices/fullcourt.html">click here</A>].<P>
<H5>Lower Federal Courts</H5>
Decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeals are appearing on the Internet.  The several sites offering individual courts are <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/opinions.html">all accessible from the LII server</A>.  Cornell's unique resource, <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://teddy.law.cornell.edu:8090/questata.htm">a statistical database on litigation in Federal Courts</A>, is also available here.
<H5>Decisions of the New York Court of Appeals</H5>
The LII has prepared and indexed the most recent decisions of the New York Court of Appeals for Internet access.  Like the Supreme Court decisions, they can be retrieved by party name or topic or key word search  [<a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/ny/ctap/overview.html">click here</A>].<P>
<H5>Important Statutes and Related Material</H5>
The LII has prepared rich hypertext versions of a number of key statutes.  These allow key word search, access via tables of chapters and sections, and include hypertext linking of all internal cross references.  Among these statutes are: <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/ucc/ucc.table.html">the Uniform Commercial Code (Including Official Comments)</A>, the <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/topics/copyright.html">Copyright Act,</A> the <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/topics/patent.html">Patent Act</A>, and the <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/topics/trademark.html">Federal Trademark Act</A>.  In addition to these individual statutes, the LII has prepared a hypertext version of the <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/">full U.S. Code as published on CD-ROM by the Government Printing Office</A> and organized the growing number of <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/focus/state_statutes.html">state statutes on the Internet by topic</A>. For a more complete listing of statutes and similar material available via this site [<a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/statutes.html">click here</A>].
<H5>International Treaties</H5>
A large collection of multilateral treaties is available here, dealing with international trade [<a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://ananse.irv.uit.no/trade_law/nav/trade.html">click here</A>] and a wide range of other issues [<a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.tufts.edu/fletcher/multilaterals.html">click here</A>].<P>
<H5>E-Mail Address Directory of U.S. Law Schools</H5>
One of the first projects undertaken by the Institute was the collection of e-mail addresses of faculty, library and technical staff of U.S. law schools.  The resulting directory, mounted here, is searchable and when accessed by a browser capable of sending e-mail, it can be used to launch a message directly.  To access the directory, <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/dla/">click here</A>.  Since the establishment of the directory in 1992, e-mail has become an important medium of exchange in law.  Several of the Internet lists in the field of law archived on the Institute's server -- in a searchable form [<a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://gopher.law.cornell.edu:70/1/listservs">click here</A>].<P>
<H5>Law Journals</H5>
The LII's server is the Internet home for the <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/clr/clr.htm">Cornell Law Review</A> and the <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/jol/jol.table.html">Journal of Online Law</A>.  It also provides access to legal journals mounted at sites around the globe.  For a list <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/journals.html">click here.</A>
<H5>Current Awareness Services</H5>
Two bulletins analyzing recent decisions are available from the LII via e-mail, the liibulletin (reporting on the Supreme Court) and liibulletin-ny (reporting on the New York Court of Appeals).  For further information on both <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/focus/bulletins.html">click here.</A>  In addition, the LII provides two WWW-based services: <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://barratry.law.cornell.edu:5123/notify/buzz.html">BigEar</A> which lists new sites being discussed on law lists and <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/focus/liieye.htm">LII's Eye on the Courts</A> which links to newsworthy appellate decisions on the Net.
<a name=access><H4>The LII Server as Organizer of Legal Material Held Elsewhere on the Internet</H4></A>
The World Wide Web allows the gathering of materials that are mounted on computers scattered around the globe.  This server seeks to take full advantage of materials others have put on the Net.  First, it offers a detailed set of tables organizing law material by topic and by type or source of document which gather related materials, no matter where their source.  To see those tables <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/lii.table.html#main_menus">click here.</A>  Just as the Supreme Court materials here provide access tools, related material about the Court, and context setting information, coverage of other legal topics by the LII includes explanation and cross references.  For an example, <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/topics/topic2.html">click here to see the LII's topical documents on commerial law.</A>

<HR>

Starting in the fall of 1995, the Cornell Legal Information Institute
introduced a new current-awareness service, the liibulletin-ny.  Written
by student editors in their second and third years of law school, the
liibulletin-ny analyzes the more significant decisions of the New York
Court of Appeals.  It is available both on this site (with hypertext links
to appropriate sources) and by electronic mail (via free subscription).

<DT> <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/bulletin/bulletin.htm">Bulletin Table of Contents</A>
<DD>A complete listing of the liibulletin-ny commentaries.

<DT><a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/bulletin/court.htm">New York Court of Appeals</A>
<DD>The Court of Appeals is New York's court of last resort.  The judges 
are appointed by the Governor with the consent of the Senate from a list 
of nominations provided by the Commission on Judicial Nominations.

<DT><a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/bulletin/96board.htm">1996-97 liibulletin-ny Editorial Board</A>
<DD>The liibulletin-ny editorial board is 
composed entirely of second and
third year Cornell Law School students.  <a  href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/bulletin/95board.htm">Liibulletin-ny's founding editorial board</A> 
chose to distinguish itself from traditional journals, by adopting an 
organizational strategy which is not very hierarchical.  As a result, all
members share writing, editing, and HTML mark-up duties.

<DT><a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/bulletin/start.htm">How to Start Your Own Bulletin</A> 
<DD>Liibulletin-ny may be the first of its kind on the Internet, but it 
is hopefully only the first of many similar publications.  Given the 
historic relationship with publishing the opinions of the New York Court 
of Appeals, we took our start with commentaries from this particular 
court.  With no formal model to follow, the liibulletin-ny developed an 
internal handbook and style sheet to guide our work.

<H2> About Whale-Watching-Web</H2>

<FONT SIZE=4> By watching the whales <B>you can prolong the life of cetaceans as a species

</B>. This may be the last chance before they say goodbye for

<H2>1. Whale watching world-wide</H2>

<P>

Whale watching as a commercial activity began in 1955 in North

America along the southern California coast. Today, whale watching

is carried on in the waters of some 40 countries, plus Antarctica.

All the large whale species and many dolphins and porpoises can

be seen regularly on a wide range of tours, lasting from an hour

to two weeks. Whale watching is a non-consumptive use of whales

with economic, recreational, educational and scientific dimensions.

The economic benefits occur in areas where whale watching has

quickly become a significant aspect of a local tourism economy.

<P>

If prospective tour operators examine areas where whale-watching

industries have matured and learn from their experiences, whale

watching world-wide can continue to grow with maximum benefits

accruing to local communities, companies, scientists, conservation

societies, whale watchers and, ultimately, the whales themselves.(Cit:

Hoyt E.1992. &quot;Whale watching around the world&quot;Int. whale

watching bulletin #7)

<P>
Welcome to the United States Code, generated from the most recent version
of the Government Printing Office CD-ROM. It contains the laws in force as
of <B>26 January 1994</B>. <I>[For guidance on how to determine if a particular
part of the Code has since been amended <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/lexicon/uscode.html">click
here</A>.]</I>
<P>
Below is a listing of all Titles. There are six ways to access information
in the Code:
<UL>
  <LI>
    via <a href="#HEADINGS">a search of all headings in the Code</A>.  
This can be the fastest way to look for a particular topic or law for 
which you know a keyword.
  <LI>
    via <a href="#TITLES">a listing of all Titles</A>
  <LI>
    via <a href ="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/uscode/topn/">the Table of Popular Names</A>, which contains the
    popular names of many laws (eg. the <I>Mann Act</I>)
  <LI>
    via <a href="#SECTIONS">a form which permits you to look up specific
    sections</A>. This is particularly useful if you have a cite (eg. <I>14 USC
    1225</I>)
  <LI>
    via our new <a href="#fastlook"> fast search feature</A>. This offers faster
    searching than our old waisindex version (still offered).
  <LI>
    via a <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/uscode/waisindex?">full text search</A> of the Code. Note that words
    that appear more than 20,000 times (such as chapter) are filtered out by
    WAIS.
  <LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Note that the United States Code is a VERY large document. &nbsp;It is
much faster -- and kinder to other users of the system -- if you limit your
text searches to a particular area (Title) of the Code. &nbsp;To do so, go
first to the <a href="#TITLES">listing of all Titles</A> and choose the Title
you want; then, use the text-search link on the overview page for that Title
to do your search.</I>
<P>

<P>
We now offer a search interface to the Code which is based on the Harvest
system, and we strongly encourage you to use it. Not only does it run a little
faster than the older WAIS-based version, it presents search results in a
way which gives you a better idea of what you've found.
<P>
<I>Of course, it is faster still to search only a <a href="#TITLES">particular
title </A>of the Code if you already know roughly where to look</I>

<I>Some search tips and tricks:</I>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Phrase searches (eg. "income tax") should be entered in quotes.
  <LI>
    You can do boolean searches, but you must capitalize AND and OR, eg. <B>issuer
    AND stock OR securities</B>
  <LI>
    You can search for code sections by popular name. To find the Black Lung
    Benefits Act of 1972 , say<BR>
    <B>popname:"black lung"</B>
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><a name=HEADINGS>Search headings in the Code</A></H2>
You can get more relevant results more quickly by searching only the 
headings of the various sections of the Code.  This is especially true 
when you're searching for laws related to a particular concept or group 
of people, which may be scattered throughout the code.

<P>CIVIL ACTION  No. 96-1458</P>
<P>Before: Sloviter, Chief Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit; Buckwalter and Dalzell, Judges, United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania</P>
<P>June 11, 1996</P>
<P>ADJUDICATION ON MOTIONS FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION</P>
<H1>I.</H1>
<H1>INTRODUCTION</H1>
<H1>Procedural Background</H1>
<P>Before us are motions for a preliminary injunction filed by plaintiffs who
challenge on constitutional grounds provisions of the Communications Decency Act
of 1996 (CDA or &quot;the Act&quot;), which constitutes Title V of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, signed into law by the President on February 8,
1996.(1)  Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, &#167; 502, 110
Stat. 56, 133-35.  Plaintiffs include various organizations and individuals who,
inter alia, are associated with the computer and/or communications industries,
or who publish or post materials on the Internet, or belong to various citizen
groups.  See ACLU Complaint (&#182;&#182; 7-26), ALA First Amended Complaint (&#182;&#182;
3, 12-33).  </P>
<P>The defendants in these actions are Janet Reno, the Attorney General of the
United States, and the United States Department of Justice.  For convenience, we
will refer to these defendants as the Government.  Plaintiffs contend that the
two challenged provisions of the CDA that are directed to communications over
the Internet which might be deemed &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently
offensive&quot; for minors, defined as persons under the age of eighteen,
infringe upon rights protected by the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause
of the Fifth Amendment.</P>
<P>Plaintiffs in Civil Action Number 96-963, in which the lead plaintiff is the
American Civil Liberties Union (the ACLU),(2) filed their action in the United

States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on the day the
Act was signed, and moved for a temporary restraining order to enjoin
enforcement of these two provisions of the CDA.  On February 15, 1996, following
an evidentiary hearing, Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter, to whom the case had been
assigned, granted a limited temporary restraining order, finding in a Memorandum
that 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(a)(1)(B) (&quot;the indecency provision&quot; of the
CDA) was unconstitutionally vague.  On the same day, Chief Judge Dolores K.
Sloviter, Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit, having been requested by the parties and the district court to convene
a three-judge court, pursuant to &#167; 561(a) of the CDA, appointed such a
court consisting of, in addition to Judge Buckwalter, Judge Stewart Dalzell of
the same district, and herself, as the circuit judge required by 28 U.S.C. &#167;
2284.</P>
<P>After a conference with the court, the parties entered into a stipulation,
which the court approved on February 26, 1996, wherein the Attorney General
agreed that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>she will not initiate any investigations or prosecutions for violations of
47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(d) for conduct occurring after enactment of this provision
until the three-judge court hears Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction
. . . and has decided the motion.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Attorney General's commitment was qualified to the extent that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>her full authority to investigate or prosecute any violation of &#167;
223(a)(1)(B), as amended, and &#167; 223(d) as to conduct which occurs or
occurred during any period of time after enactment of these provisions
(including for the period of time to which this stipulation applies) should the
Court deny plaintiffs' motion or, if the motion is granted, should these
provisions ultimately be upheld.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Stipulation, &#182; 4, in C.A. No. 96-963.</P>
<P>Shortly thereafter, the American Library Association, Inc. (the ALA) and
others(3) filed a similar action at C.A. No. 96-1458.  On February 27, 1996,
Chief Judge Sloviter, again pursuant to &#167; 561(a) of the CDA and upon
request, convened the same three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2284. 
The actions were consolidated pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a), &quot;for all
matters relating to the disposition of motions for preliminary injunction in
these cases, including the hearing on such motions.&quot;</P>
<P>The parties were afforded expedited discovery in connection with the motions
for preliminary injunction, and they cooperated with Judge Dalzell, who had been
assigned the case management aspects of the litigation.  While the discovery was
proceeding, and with the agreement of the parties, the court began receiving
evidence at the consolidated hearings which were conducted on March 21 and 22,
and April 1, 12 and 15, 1996.  In order to expedite the proceedings, the parties
worked closely with Judge Dalzell and arranged to stipulate to many of the
underlying facts and to place much of their cases in chief before the court by
sworn declarations, so that the hearings were largely devoted to
cross-examination of certain of the witnesses whose declarations had been filed.
 The parties submitted proposed findings of fact and post-hearing memoranda on
April 29, and the court heard extensive oral argument on May 10, 1996.(4)</P>
<H1>Statutory Provisions at Issue</H1>
<P>Plaintiffs focus their challenge on two provisions of section 502 of the CDA
which amend 47 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 223(a) and 223(d).</P>
<P>Section 223(a)(1)(B) provides in part that any person in interstate or
foreign communications who, &quot;by means of a telecommunications device,&quot;(5)
&quot;knowingly . . . makes, creates, or solicits&quot; and &quot;initiates the
transmission&quot; of &quot;any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image or
other communication which is obscene or indecent, knowing that the recipient of
the communication is under 18 years of age,&quot; &quot;shall be criminally
fined or imprisoned.&quot; (emphasis added).  </P>
<P>Section 223(d)(1) (&quot;the patently offensive provision&quot;), makes it a
crime to use an &quot;interactive computer service&quot;(6) to &quot;send&quot;
or &quot;display in a manner available&quot; to a person under age 18, &quot;any
comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication that, in
context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs,
regardless of whether the user of such service placed the call or initiated the
communication.&quot; </P>
<P>Plaintiffs also challenge on the same grounds the provisions in &#167;
223(a)(2) and &#167; 223(d)(2), which make it a crime for anyone to &quot;knowingly
permit[] any telecommunications facility under [his or her] control to be used
for any activity prohibited&quot; in &#167;&#167; 223(a)(1)(B) and 223(d)(1). 
The challenged provisions impose a punishment of a fine, up to two years
imprisonment, or both for each offense.  </P>
<P>Plaintiffs make clear that they do not quarrel with the statute to the
extent that it covers obscenity or child pornography, which were already
proscribed before the CDA's adoption.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1464-65
(criminalizing obscene material); id. &#167;&#167; 2251-52 (criminalizing child
pornography); see also New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982); Miller v.
California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973).</P>
<P>Plaintiffs in the ACLU action also challenge the provision of the CDA that
criminalizes speech over the Internet that transmits information about abortions
or abortifacient drugs and devices, through its amendment of 18 U.S.C. &#167;
1462(c).  That section now prohibits the sending and receiving of information
over the Internet by any means regarding &quot;where, how, or of whom, or by
what means any [drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended
for producing abortion] may be obtained or made&quot;.  The Government has
stated that it does not contest plaintiffs' challenge to the enforceability of
the provision of the CDA as it relates to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1462(c).(7) </P>
<P>As part of its argument that the CDA passes constitutional muster, the
Government cites the CDA's &quot;safe harbor&quot; defenses in new &#167; 223(e)
of 47 U.S.C., which provides:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) <B>Defenses</B></P>
<P>In addition to any other defenses available by law:</P>
<P>(1) No person shall be held to have violated subsection (a) or (d) of this
section solely for providing access or connection to or from a facility, system,
or network not under that person's control, including transmission, downloading,
intermediate storage, access software, or other related capabilities that are
incidental to providing such access or connection that does not include the
creation of the content of the communication.</P>
<P>(2) The defenses provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be
applicable to a person who is a conspirator with an entity actively involved in

<H1>FINDINGS OF FACT</H1>
<P>All parties agree that in order to apprehend the legal questions at issue in
these cases, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the exponentially
growing, worldwide medium that is the Internet, which presents unique issues
relating to the application of First Amendment jurisprudence and due process
requirements to this new and evolving method of communication.  For this reason
all parties insisted on having extensive evidentiary hearings before the
three-judge court. The court's Findings of fact are made pursuant to Fed. R.
Civ. P. 52(a).  The history and basic technology of this medium are not in
dispute, and the first forty-eight paragraphs of the following Findings of fact
are derived from the like-numbered paragraphs of a stipulation(8) the parties
filed with the court.(9)</P>
<H1>The Nature of Cyberspace</H1>
<H1>The Creation of the Internet and the Development of Cyberspace</H1>
<OL>
<LI> The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity, but rather a giant
network which interconnects innumerable smaller groups of linked computer
networks.  It is thus a network of networks.  This is best understood if one
considers what a linked group of computers -- referred to here as a &quot;network&quot;
-- is, and what it does.  Small networks are now ubiquitous (and are often
called &quot;local area networks&quot;).  For example, in many United States
Courthouses, computers are linked to each other for the purpose of exchanging
files and messages (and to share equipment such as printers).  These are
networks.  
</LI>
<LI>  Some networks are &quot;closed&quot; networks, not linked to other
computers or networks.  Many networks, however, are connected to other networks,
which are in turn connected to other networks in a manner which permits each
computer in any network to communicate with computers on any other network in
the system.  This global Web of linked networks and computers is referred to as

the Internet.
</LI>
<LI>  The nature of the Internet is such that it is very difficult, if not
impossible, to determine its size at a given moment.  It is indisputable,
however, that the Internet has experienced extraordinary growth in recent years.
 In 1981, fewer than 300 computers were linked to the Internet, and by 1989, the
number stood at fewer than 90,000 computers.  By 1993, over 1,000,000 computers
were linked.  Today, over 9,400,000 host computers worldwide, of which
approximately 60 percent located within the United States, are estimated to be
linked to the Internet.  This count does not include the personal computers
people use to access the Internet using modems.  In all, reasonable estimates
are that as many as 40 million people around the world can and do access the
enormously flexible communication Internet medium.  That figure is expected to
grow to 200 million Internet users by the year 1999. 
</LI>
<LI>  Some of the computers and computer networks that make up the Internet are
owned by governmental and public institutions, some are owned by non-profit
organizations, and some are privately owned.  The resulting whole is a
decentralized, global medium of communications -- or &quot;cyberspace&quot; --
that links people, institutions, corporations, and governments around the world.
 The Internet is an international system.  This communications medium allows any
of the literally tens of millions of people with access to the Internet to
exchange information.  These communications can occur almost instantaneously,
and can be directed either to specific individuals, to a broader group of people
interested in a particular subject, or to the world as a whole.

</LI>
<LI>  The Internet had its origins in 1969 as an experimental project of the
Advanced Research Project Agency (&quot;ARPA&quot;), and was called ARPANET. 

This network linked computers and computer networks owned by the military,
defense contractors, and university laboratories conducting defense-related
research.  The network later allowed researchers across the country to access
directly and to use extremely powerful supercomputers located at a few key
universities and laboratories.  As it evolved far beyond its research origins in
the United States to encompass universities, corporations, and people around the
world, the ARPANET came to be called the &quot;DARPA Internet,&quot; and finally
just the &quot;Internet.&quot;
</LI>
<LI>  From its inception, the network was designed to be a decentralized,
self-maintaining series of redundant links between computers and computer
networks, capable of rapidly transmitting communications without direct human
involvement or control, and with the automatic ability to re-route
communications if one or more individual links were damaged or otherwise
unavailable.  Among other goals, this redundant system of linked computers was
designed to allow vital research and communications to continue even if portions
of the network were damaged, say, in a war.
</LI>
<LI>  To achieve this resilient nationwide (and ultimately global)
communications medium, the ARPANET encouraged the creation of multiple links to
and from each computer (or computer network) on the network.  Thus, a computer
located in Washington, D.C., might be linked (usually using dedicated telephone
lines) to other computers in neighboring states or on the Eastern seaboard. 
Each of those computers could in turn be linked to other computers, which
themselves would be linked to other computers.
</LI>
<LI>  A communication sent over this redundant series of linked computers could
travel any of a number of routes to its destination.  Thus, a message sent from
a computer in Washington, D.C., to a computer in Palo Alto, California, might
first be sent to a computer in Philadelphia, and then be forwarded to a computer
in Pittsburgh, and then to Chicago, Denver, and Salt Lake City, before finally
reaching Palo Alto.  If the message could not travel along that path (because of
military attack, simple technical malfunction, or other reason), the message
would automatically (without human intervention or even knowledge) be re-routed,
perhaps, from Washington, D.C. to Richmond, and then to Atlanta, New Orleans,
Dallas, Albuquerque, Los Angeles, and finally to Palo Alto.  This type of
transmission, and re-routing, would likely occur in a matter of seconds.
</LI>
<LI> Messages between computers on the Internet do not necessarily travel
entirely along the same path.  The Internet uses &quot;packet switching&quot;
communication protocols that allow individual messages to be subdivided into
smaller &quot;packets&quot; that are then sent independently to the destination,
and are then automatically reassembled by the receiving computer.  While all
packets of a given message often travel along the same path to the destination,
if computers along the route become overloaded, then packets can be re-routed to
less loaded computers.
</LI>
<LI> At the same time that ARPANET was maturing (it subsequently ceased to
exist), similar networks developed to link universities, research facilities,
businesses, and individuals around the world.  These other formal or loose
networks included BITNET, CSNET, FIDONET, and USENET.  Eventually, each of these
networks (many of which overlapped) were themselves linked together, allowing
users of any computers linked to any one of the networks to transmit
communications to users of computers on other networks.  It is this series of
linked networks (themselves linking computers and computer networks) that is
today commonly known as the Internet.
</LI>
<LI>  No single entity -- academic, corporate, governmental, or non-profit --
administers the Internet.  It exists and functions as a result of the fact that
hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer networks
independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to exchange
communications and information with other computers (which in turn exchange
communications and information with still other computers).  There is no
centralized storage location, control point, or communications channel for the
Internet, and it would not be technically feasible for a single entity to
control all of the information conveyed on the Internet.
</LI></OL>
<H1>How Individuals Access the Internet</H1>
<P>12. Individuals have a wide variety of avenues to access cyberspace in
general, and the Internet in particular.  In terms of physical access, there are
two common methods to establish an actual link to the Internet.  First, one can
use a computer or computer terminal that is directly (and usually permanently)
connected to a computer network that is itself directly or indirectly connected
to the Internet.  Second, one can use a &quot;personal computer&quot; with a &quot;modem&quot;
to connect over a telephone line to a larger computer or computer network that
is itself directly or indirectly connected to the Internet.  As detailed below,
both direct and modem connections are made available to people by a wide variety
of academic, governmental, or commercial entities.</P>
<P>13. Students, faculty, researchers, and others affiliated with the vast
majority of colleges and universities in the United States can access the
Internet through their educational institutions.  Such access is often via
direct connection using computers located in campus libraries, offices, or
computer centers, or may be through telephone access using a modem from a
student's or professor's campus or off-campus location.  Some colleges and
universities install &quot;ports&quot; or outlets for direct network connections
in each dormitory room or provide access via computers located in common areas
in dormitories.  Such access enables students and professors to use information
and content provided by the college or university itself, and to use the vast
amount of research resources and other information available on the Internet
worldwide.</P>
<P>14.  Similarly, Internet resources and access are sufficiently important to
many corporations and other employers that those employers link their office
computer networks to the Internet and provide employees with direct or modem
access to the office network (and thus to the Internet).  Such access might be
used by, for example, a corporation involved in scientific or medical research
or manufacturing to enable corporate employees to exchange information and ideas
with academic researchers in their fields.</P>
<P>15.  Those who lack access to the Internet through their schools or
employers still have a variety of ways they can access the Internet.  Many
communities across the country have established &quot;free-nets&quot; or
community networks to provide their citizens with a local link to the Internet
(and to provide local-oriented content and discussion groups).  The first such

community network, the Cleveland Free-Net Community Computer System, was
established in 1986, and free-nets now exist in scores of communities as diverse
as Richmond, Virginia, Tallahassee, Florida, Seattle, Washington, and San Diego,
California.  Individuals typically can access free-nets at little or no cost via
modem connection or by using computers available in community buildings. 
Free-nets are often operated by a local library, educational institution, or
non-profit community group.</P>
<P>16.  Individuals can also access the Internet through many local libraries. 
Libraries often offer patrons use of computers that are linked to the Internet. 
In addition, some libraries offer telephone modem access to the libraries'
computers, which are themselves connected to the Internet.  Increasingly,

patrons now use library services and resources without ever physically entering
the library itself.  Libraries typically provide such direct or modem access at
no cost to the individual user.  </P>
<P>17.  Individuals can also access the Internet by patronizing an increasing
number of storefront &quot;computer coffee shops,&quot; where customers -- while
they drink their coffee -- can use computers provided by the shop to access the
Internet.  Such Internet access is typically provided by the shop for a small
hourly fee. </P>
<P>18.  Individuals can also access the Internet through commercial and
non-commercial &quot;Internet service providers&quot; that typically offer modem
telephone access to a computer or computer network linked to the Internet.  Many
such providers -- including the members of plaintiff Commercial Internet
Exchange Association -- are commercial entities offering Internet access for a 
monthly or hourly fee.  Some Internet service providers, however, are non-profit
organizations that offer free or very low cost access to the Internet.  For
example, the International Internet Association offers free modem access to the
Internet upon request.  Also, a number of trade or other non-profit associations
offer Internet access as a service to members. </P>
<P>19.  Another common way for individuals to access the Internet is through
one of the major national commercial &quot;online services&quot; such as America
Online, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy.  These online services
offer nationwide computer networks (so that subscribers can dial-in to a local
telephone number), and the services provide extensive and well organized content
within their own proprietary computer networks.  In addition to allowing access
to the extensive content available within each online service, the services also
allow subscribers to link to the much larger resources of the Internet.  Full
access to the online service (including access to the Internet) can be obtained
for modest monthly or hourly fees.  The major commercial online services have
almost twelve million individual subscribers across the United States.</P>
<P>20.  In addition to using the national commercial online services,
individuals can also access the Internet using some (but not all) of the
thousands of local dial-in computer services, often called &quot;bulletin board
systems&quot; or &quot;BBSs.&quot;  With an investment of as little as $2,000.00
and the cost of a telephone line, individuals, non-profit organizations,
advocacy groups, and businesses can offer their own dial-in computer &quot;bulletin
board&quot; service where friends, members, subscribers, or customers can
exchange ideas and information.  BBSs range from single computers with only one
telephone line into the computer (allowing only one user at a time), to single
computers with many telephone lines into the computer (allowing multiple
simultaneous users), to multiple linked computers each servicing multiple
dial-in telephone lines (allowing multiple simultaneous users).  Some (but not
all) of these BBS systems offer direct or indirect links to the Internet.  Some
BBS systems charge users a nominal fee for access, while many others are free to
the individual users. </P>
<P>21. Although commercial access to the Internet is growing rapidly, many
users of the Internet -- such as college students and staff -- do not
individually pay for access (except to the extent, for example, that the cost of
computer services is a component of college tuition).  These and other Internet
users can access the Internet without paying for such access with a credit card
or other form of payment.</P>
<H1>Methods to Communicate Over the Internet</H1>
<P>22.  Once one has access to the Internet, there are a wide variety of
different methods of communication and information exchange over the network. 

These many methods of communication and information retrieval are constantly
evolving and are therefore difficult to categorize concisely.  The most common
methods of communications on the Internet (as well as within the major online
services) can be roughly grouped into six categories: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(1) one-to-one messaging (such as &quot;e-mail&quot;), </P>
<P>(2) one-to-many messaging (such as &quot;listserv&quot;),</P>
<P>(3) distributed message databases (such as &quot;USENET newsgroups&quot;),
</P>
<P>(4) real time communication (such as &quot;Internet Relay Chat&quot;), </P>
<P>(5) real time remote computer utilization (such as &quot;telnet&quot;), and
</P>
<P>(6) remote information retrieval (such as &quot;ftp,&quot; &quot;gopher,&quot;
and the &quot;World Wide Web&quot;).  </P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Most of these methods of communication can be used to transmit text, data,
computer programs, sound, visual images (i.e., pictures), and moving video
images.</P>
<P>23.  One-to-one messaging.  One method of communication on the Internet is
via electronic mail, or &quot;e-mail,&quot; comparable in principle to sending a
first class letter.  One can address and transmit a message to one or more other
people.  E-mail on the Internet is not routed through a central control point,
and can take many and varying paths to the recipients.  Unlike postal mail,
simple e-mail generally is not &quot;sealed&quot; or secure, and can be accessed
or viewed on intermediate computers between the sender and recipient (unless the
message is encrypted).</P>
<P>24.  One-to-many messaging.  The Internet also contains automatic mailing
list services (such as &quot;listservs&quot;), [also referred to by witnesses as
&quot;mail exploders&quot;] that allow communications about particular subjects
of interest to a group of people.  For example, people can subscribe to a &quot;listserv&quot;
mailing list on a particular topic of interest to them.  The subscriber can
submit messages on the topic to the listserv that are forwarded (via e-mail),
either automatically or through a human moderator overseeing the listserv, to
anyone who has subscribed to the mailing list.  A recipient of such a message
can reply to the message and have the reply also distributed to everyone on the
mailing list.  This service provides the capability to keep abreast of
developments or events in a particular subject area.  Most listserv-type mailing
lists automatically forward all incoming messages to all mailing list
subscribers.  There are thousands of such mailing list services on the Internet,
collectively with hundreds of thousands of subscribers.  Users of &quot;open&quot;
listservs typically can add or remove their names from the mailing list
automatically, with no direct human involvement.  Listservs may also be &quot;closed,&quot;
i.e., only allowing for one's acceptance into the listserv by a human moderator.</P>
<P>25.  Distributed message databases.  Similar in function to listservs -- but
quite different in how communications are transmitted -- are distributed message
databases such as &quot;USENET newsgroups.&quot;  User-sponsored newsgroups are
among the most popular and widespread applications of Internet services, and
cover all imaginable topics of interest to users.  Like listservs, newsgroups
are open discussions and exchanges on particular topics.  Users, however, need
not subscribe to the discussion mailing list in advance, but can instead access
the database at any time.  Some USENET newsgroups are &quot;moderated&quot; but
most are open access.  For the moderated newsgroups,(10) all messages to the
newsgroup are forwarded to one person who can screen them for relevance to the
topics under discussion.  USENET newsgroups are disseminated using ad hoc, peer
to peer connections between approximately 200,000 computers (called USENET &quot;servers&quot;)
around the world.  For unmoderated newsgroups, when an individual user with
access to a USENET server posts a message to a newsgroup, the message is
automatically forwarded to all adjacent USENET servers that furnish access to
the newsgroup, and it is then propagated to the servers adjacent to those
servers, etc.  The messages are temporarily stored on each receiving server,
where they are available for review and response by individual users.  The
messages are automatically and periodically purged from each system after a time
to make room for new messages.  Responses to messages, like the original
messages, are automatically distributed to all other computers receiving the
newsgroup or forwarded to a moderator in the case of a moderated newsgroup.  The
dissemination of messages to USENET servers around the world is an automated
process that does not require direct human intervention or review. </P>
<P>26. There are newsgroups on more than fifteen thousand different subjects. 
In 1994, approximately 70,000 messages were posted to newsgroups each day, and
those messages were distributed to the approximately 190,000 computers or
computer networks that participate in the USENET newsgroup system.  Once the
messages reach the approximately 190,000 receiving computers or computer
networks, they are available to individual users of those computers or computer
networks.  Collectively, almost 100,000 new messages (or &quot;articles&quot;)
are posted to newsgroups each day.</P>
<P>27.  Real time communication.  In addition to transmitting messages that can
be later read or accessed, individuals on the Internet can engage in an
immediate dialog, in &quot;real time&quot;, with other people on the Internet. 
In its simplest forms, &quot;talk&quot; allows one-to-one communications and &quot;Internet
Relay Chat&quot; (or IRC) allows two or more to type messages to each other that
almost immediately appear on the others' computer screens.  IRC is analogous to
a telephone party line, using a computer and keyboard rather than a telephone. 
With IRC, however, at any one time there are thousands of different party lines
available, in which collectively tens of thousands of users are engaging in
conversations on a huge range of subjects.  Moreover, one can create a new party
line to discuss a different topic at any time.  Some IRC conversations are &quot;moderated&quot;
or include &quot;channel operators.&quot;</P>
<P>28. In addition, commercial online services such as America Online,
CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy have their own &quot;chat&quot;
systems allowing their members to converse.</P>
<P>29.  Real time remote computer utilization.  Another method to use
information on the Internet is to access and control remote computers in &quot;real
time&quot; using &quot;telnet.&quot;  For example, using telnet, a researcher at
a university would be able to use the computing power of a supercomputer located
at a different university.  A student can use telnet to connect to a remote
library to access the library's online card catalog program.  </P>
<P>30.  Remote information retrieval.  The final major category of
communication may be the most well known use of the Internet -- the search for
and retrieval of information located on remote computers.  There are three
primary methods to locate and retrieve information on the Internet.  </P>
<P>31. A simple method uses &quot;ftp&quot; (or file transfer protocol) to list
the names of computer files available on a remote computer, and to transfer one
or more of those files to an individual's local computer.  </P>
<P>32. Another approach uses a program and format named &quot;gopher&quot; to
guide an individual's search through the resources available on a remote
computer.  </P>
<H1>The World Wide Web</H1>
<P>33. A third approach, and fast becoming the most well-known on the Internet,
is the &quot;World Wide Web.&quot;  The Web utilizes a &quot;hypertext&quot;
formatting language called hypertext markup language (HTML), and programs that &quot;browse&quot;
the Web can display HTML documents containing text, images, sound, animation and
moving video.  Any HTML document can include links to other types of information
or resources, so that while viewing an HTML document that, for example,
describes resources available on the Internet, one can &quot;click&quot; using a
computer mouse on the description of the resource and be immediately connected
to the resource itself.  Such &quot;hyperlinks&quot; allow information to be
accessed and organized in very flexible ways, and allow people to locate and
efficiently view related information even if the information is stored on
numerous computers all around the world.</P>
<P>34. Purpose.  The World Wide Web (W3C) was created to serve as the platform
for a global, online store of knowledge, containing information from a diversity
of sources and accessible to Internet users around the world.  Though
information on the Web is contained in individual computers, the fact that each
of these computers is connected to the Internet through W3C protocols allows all
of the information to become part of a single body of knowledge.  It is
currently the most advanced information system developed on the Internet, and
embraces within its data model most information in previous networked
information systems such as ftp, gopher, wais, and Usenet.  </P>
<P>35. History.  W3C was originally developed at CERN, the European Particle
Physics Laboratory, and was initially used to allow information sharing within
internationally dispersed teams of researchers and engineers.  Originally aimed
at the High Energy Physics community, it has spread to other areas and attracted
much interest in user support, resource recovery, and many other areas which
depend on collaborative and information sharing.  The Web has extended beyond
the scientific and academic community to include communications by individuals,
non-profit organizations, and businesses.</P>
<P>36. Basic Operation.  The World Wide Web is a series of documents stored in
different computers all over the Internet.  Documents contain information stored
in a variety of formats, including text, still images, sounds, and video.  An
essential element of the Web is that any document has an address (rather like a
telephone number).  Most Web documents contain &quot;links.&quot;  These are
short sections of text or image which refer to another document.  Typically the
linked text is blue or underlined when displayed, and when selected by the user,
the referenced document is automatically displayed, wherever in the world it
actually is stored.  Links for example are used to lead from overview documents
to more detailed documents, from tables of contents to particular pages, but
also as cross-references, footnotes, and new forms of information structure. 
</P>
<P>37. Many organizations now have &quot;home pages&quot; on the Web.  These
are documents which provide a set of links designed to represent the
organization, and through links from the home page, guide the user directly or
indirectly to information about or relevant to that organization.  </P>
<P>38. As an example of the use of links, if these Findings were to be put on a
World Wide Web site, its home page might contain links such as those:  </P>
<UL>
<LI>THE NATURE OF CYBERSPACE 
</LI>
<LI>CREATION OF THE INTERNET AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CYBERSPACE
</LI>
<LI>HOW PEOPLE ACCESS THE INTERNET
</LI>

<LI>METHODS TO COMMUNICATE OVER THE INTERNET 
</LI></UL>
<P>39. Each of these links takes the user of the site from the beginning of the
Findings to the appropriate section within this Adjudication.  Links may also
take the user from the original Web site to another Web site on another computer
connected to the Internet.  These links from one computer to another, from one
document to another across the Internet, are what unify the Web into a single
body of knowledge, and what makes the Web unique.  The Web was designed with a
maximum target time to follow a link of one tenth of a second.</P>
<P>40. Publishing.  The World Wide Web exists fundamentally as a platform
through which people and organizations can communicate through shared
information.  When information is made available, it is said to be &quot;published&quot;
on the Web.  Publishing on the Web simply requires that the &quot;publisher&quot;
has a computer connected to the Internet and that the computer is running W3C
server software.  The computer can be as simple as a small personal computer
costing less than $1500 dollars or as complex as a multi-million dollar
mainframe computer.  Many Web publishers choose instead to lease disk storage
space from someone else who has the necessary computer facilities, eliminating
the need for actually owning any equipment oneself.  </P>
<P>41. The Web, as a universe of network accessible information, contains a
variety of documents prepared with quite varying degrees of care, from the
hastily typed idea, to the professionally executed corporate profile.  The power
of the Web stems from the ability of a link to point to any document, regardless
of its status or physical location.  </P>
<P>42. Information to be published on the Web must also be formatted according
to the rules of the Web standards.  These standardized formats assure that all
Web users who want to read the material will be able to view it.  Web standards
are sophisticated and flexible enough that they have grown to meet the
publishing needs of many large corporations, banks, brokerage houses, newspapers
and magazines which now publish &quot;online&quot; editions of their material,
as well as government agencies, and even courts, which use the Web to
disseminate information to the public.  At the same time, Web publishing is
simple enough that thousands of individual users and small community
organizations are using the Web to publish their own personal &quot;home pages,&quot;
the equivalent of individualized newsletters about that person or organization,
which are available to everyone on the Web.  </P>
<P>43. Web publishers have a choice to make their Web sites open to the general
pool of all Internet users, or close them, thus making the information
accessible only to those with advance authorization.  Many publishers choose to
keep their sites open to all in order to give their information the widest
potential audience.  In the event that the publishers choose to maintain
restrictions on access, this may be accomplished by assigning specific user
names and passwords as a prerequisite to access to the site.  Or, in the case of
Web sites maintained for internal use of one organization, access will only be
allowed from other computers within that organization's local network.(11)</P>
<P>44. Searching the Web.  A variety of systems have developed that allow users
of the Web to search particular information among all of the public sites that
are part of the Web.  Services such as Yahoo, Magellan, Altavista, Webcrawler,
and Lycos are all services known as &quot;search engines&quot; which allow users
to search for Web sites that contain certain categories of information, or to
search for key words.  For example, a Web user looking for the text of Supreme
Court opinions would type the words &quot;Supreme Court&quot; into a search
engine, and then be presented with a list of World Wide Web sites that contain
Supreme Court information.  This list would actually be a series of links to
those sites.  Having searched out a number of sites that might contain the
desired information, the user would then follow individual links, browsing
through the information on each site, until the desired material is found.  For
many content providers on the Web, the ability to be found by these search
engines is very important.  </P>
<P>45. Common standards.  The Web links together disparate information on an
ever-growing number of Internet-linked computers by setting common information
storage formats (HTML) and a common language for the exchange of Web documents
(HTTP).  Although the information itself may be in many different formats, and
stored on computers which are not otherwise compatible, the basic Web standards
provide a basic set of standards which allow communication and exchange of
information.  Despite the fact that many types of computers are used on the Web,
and the fact that many of these machines are otherwise incompatible, those who &quot;publish&quot;
information on the Web are able to communicate with those who seek to access
information with little difficulty because of these basic technical standards. 
</P>
<P>46. A distributed system with no centralized control.  Running on tens of
thousands of individual computers on the Internet, the Web is what is known as a
distributed system.  The Web was designed so that organizations with computers
containing information can become part of the Web simply by attaching their
computers to the Internet and running appropriate World Wide Web software.  No
single organization controls any membership in the Web, nor is there any single
centralized point from which individual Web sites or services can be blocked
from the Web.  From a user's perspective, it may appear to be a single,
integrated system, but in reality it has no centralized control point.  </P>
<P>47. Contrast to closed databases.  The Web's open, distributed,
decentralized nature stands in sharp contrast to most information systems that
have come before it.  Private information services such as Westlaw, Lexis/Nexis,
and Dialog, have contained large storehouses of knowledge, and can be accessed
from the Internet with the appropriate passwords and access software.  However,
these databases are not linked together into a single whole, as is the World
Wide Web.  </P>
<P>48. Success of the Web in research, education, and political activities. 
The World Wide Web has become so popular because of its open, distributed, and
easy-to-use nature.  Rather than requiring those who seek information to
purchase new software or hardware, and to learn a new kind of system for each
new database of information they seek to access, the Web environment makes it
easy for users to jump from one set of information to another.  By the same
token, the open nature of the Web makes it easy for publishers to reach their
intended audiences without having to know in advance what kind of computer each

potential reader has, and what kind of software they will be using.  </P>
<H1>Restricting Access to Unwanted On-Line Material(12)</H1>
<H1>PICS</H1>
<P>49. With the rapid growth of the Internet, the increasing popularity of the
Web, and the existence of material online that some parents may consider
inappropriate for their children, various entities have begun to build systems
intended to enable parents to control the material which comes into their homes
and may be accessible to their children.  The World Wide Web Consortium launched
the PICS (&quot;Platform for Internet Content Selection&quot;) program in order
to develop technical standards that would support parents' ability to filter and
screen material that their children see on the Web.  </P>
<P>50. The Consortium intends that PICS will provide the ability for third
parties, as well as individual content providers, to rate content on the
Internet in a variety of ways.  When fully implemented, PICS-compatible World
Wide Web browsers, Usenet News Group readers, and other Internet applications,
will provide parents the ability to choose from a variety of rating services, or
a combination of services.</P>
<P>51. PICS working group [PICS-WG] participants include many of the major
online services providers, commercial internet access providers, hardware and
software companies, major internet content providers, and consumer
organizations.  Among active participants in the PICS effort are:  </P>

<P>52. Membership in the PICS-WG includes a broad cross-section of companies
from the computer, communications, and content industries, as well as trade
associations and public interest groups.  PICS technical specifications have
been agreed to, allowing the Internet community to begin to deploy products and
services based on the PICS-standards.</P>
<P>53. Until a majority of sites on the Internet have been rated by a PICS
rating service, PICS will initially function as a &quot;positive&quot; ratings
system in which only those sites that have been rated will be displayed using
PICS compatible software.  In other words, PICS will initially function as a
site inclusion list rather than a site exclusion list.  The default
configuration for a PICS compatible Internet application will be to block access
to all sites which have not been rated by a PICS rating service, while allowing
access to sites which have a PICS rating for appropriate content.(14)</P>
<H1>Software</H1>
<P>54. For over a year, various companies have marketed stand alone software
that is intended to enable parents and other adults to limit the Internet access
of children.  Examples of such software include:  Cyber Patrol, CYBERsitter, The
Internet Filter, Net Nanny, Parental Guidance, SurfWatch, Netscape Proxy Server,
and WebTrack.  The market for this type of software is growing, and there is
increasing competition among software providers to provide products.</P>
<H1>Cyber Patrol</H1>
<P>55. As more people, particularly children, began to use the Internet,
Microsystems Software, Inc. decided to develop and market Internet software
intended to empower parents to exercise individual choice over what material
their children could access.  Microsystems' stated intent is to develop a

product which would give parents comfort that their children can reap the
benefits of the Internet while shielding them from objectionable or otherwise
inappropriate materials based on the parents' own particular tastes and values. 
Microsystems' product, Cyber Patrol, was developed to address this need.</P>
<P>56. Cyber Patrol was first introduced in August 1995, and is currently
available in Windows and Macintosh versions.  Cyber Patrol works with both
direct Internet Access providers (ISPs, e.g., Netcom, PSI, UUnet), and
Commercial Online Service Providers (e.g., America Online, Compuserv, Prodigy,
Microsoft).  Cyber Patrol is also compatible with all major World Wide Web
browsers on the market (e.g., Netscape, Navigator, Mosaic, Prodigy's Legacy and
Skimmer browsers, America Online, Netcom's NetCruiser, etc.).  Cyber Patrol was
the first parental empowerment application to be compatible with the PICS
standard.  In February of 1996, Microsystems put the first PICS ratings server
on the Internet.  </P>
<P>57. The CyberNOT list contains approximately 7000 sites in twelve
categories.  The software is designed to enable parents to selectively block
access to any or all of the twelve CyberNOT categories simply by checking boxes
in the Cyber Patrol Headquarters (the Cyber Patrol program manager).  These
categories are:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Violence/Profanity:  Extreme cruelty, physical or emotional acts against any
animal or person which are primarily intended to hurt or inflict pain.  Obscene
words, phrases, and profanity defined as text that uses George Carlin's seven
censored words more often than once every fifty messages or pages. </P>
<P>Partial Nudity:  Full or partial exposure of the human anatomy except when
exposing genitalia.</P>
<P>Nudity:  Any exposure of the human genitalia.</P>
<P>Sexual Acts (graphic or text):  Pictures or text exposing anyone or anything
involved in explicit sexual acts and lewd and lascivious behavior, including
masturbation, copulation, pedophilia, intimacy and involving nude or partially
nude people in heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian or homosexual encounters.  Also
includes phone sex ads, dating services, adult personals, CD-ROM and videos.</P>
<P>Gross Depictions (graphic or text):  Pictures or descriptive text of anyone
or anything which are crudely vulgar, deficient in civility or behavior, or
showing scatological impropriety.  Includes such depictions as maiming, bloody
figures, indecent depiction of bodily functions.</P>
<P>Racism/Ethnic Impropriety:  Prejudice or discrimination against any race or
ethnic culture.  Ethnic or racist jokes and slurs.  Any text that elevates one
race over another.</P>
<P>Satanic/Cult:  Worship of the devil; affinity for evil, wickedness.  Sects
or groups that potentially coerce individuals to grow, and keep, membership.</P>
<P>Drugs/Drug Culture:  Topics dealing with the use of illegal drugs for
entertainment.  This would exclude current illegal drugs used for medicinal
purposes (e.g., drugs used to treat victims of AIDS).  Includes substances used

for other than their primary purpose to alter the individual's state of mind
such as glue sniffing.</P>
<P>Militant/Extremist:  Extremely aggressive and combative behaviors,
radicalism, advocacy of extreme political measures.  Topics include extreme
political groups that advocate violence as a means to achieve their goal.</P>
<P>Gambling:  Of or relating to lotteries, casinos, betting, numbers games,

on-line sports or financial betting including non-monetary dares.</P>
<P>Questionable/Illegal:  Material or activities of a dubious nature which may
be illegal in any or all jurisdictions, such as illegal business schemes, chain
letters, software piracy, and copyright infringement.</P>
<P>Alcohol, Beer &amp; Wine:  Material pertaining to the sale or consumption of
alcoholic beverages.  Also includes sites and information relating to tobacco
products.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>58. Microsystems employs people to search the Internet for sites containing
material in these categories.  Since new sites are constantly coming online,
Microsystems updates the CyberNOT list on a weekly basis.  Once installed on the
home PC, the copy of Cyber Patrol receives automatic updates to the CyberNOT
list over the Internet every seven days.  </P>
<P>59. In February of 1996, Microsystems signed a licensing arrangement with
CompuServe, one of the leading commercial online services with over 4.3 million
subscribers.  CompuServe provides Cyber Patrol free of charge to its
subscribers.  Microsystems the same month signed a licensing arrangement with
Prodigy, another leading commercial online service with over 1.4 million
subscribers.  Prodigy will provide Cyber Patrol free of charge of its
subscribers.  </P>
<P>60. Cyber Patrol is also available directly from Microsystems for $49.95,
which includes a six month subscription to the CyberNOT blocked sites list
(updated automatically once every seven days).  After six months, parents can
receive six months of additional updates for $19.95, or twelve months for $29.95<I>.</I>
 Cyber Patrol Home Edition, a limited version of Cyber Patrol, is available free
of charge on the Internet.  To obtain either version, parents download a seven
day demonstration version of the full Cyber Patrol product from the Microsystems
Internet World Wide Web Server.  At the end of the seven day trial period, users
are offered the opportunity to purchase the complete version of Cyber Patrol or
provide Microsystems some basic demographic information in exchange for
unlimited use of the Home Edition.  The demographic information is used for
marketing and research purposes.  Since January of 1996, over 10,000
demonstration copies of Cyber Patrol have been downloaded from Microsystems' Web
site.</P>
<P>61. Cyber Patrol is also available from Retail outlets as NetBlocker Plus. 
NetBlocker Plus sells for $19.95, which includes five weeks of updates to the
CyberNOT list.  </P>

<P>62. Microsystems also sells Cyber Patrol into a growing market in schools. 
As more classrooms become connected to the Internet, many teachers want to
ensure that their students can receive the benefit of the Internet without
encountering material they deem educationally inappropriate.  </P>
<P>63. Microsystems is working with the Recreational Software Advisory Council
(RSAC), a non-profit corporation which developed rating systems for video games,
to implement the RSAC rating system for the Internet.  </P>
<P>64. The next release of Cyber Patrol, expected in second quarter of this
year, will give parents the ability to use any PICS rating service, including
the RSAC rating service, in addition to the Microsystems CyberNOT list.  </P>
<P>65. In order to speed the implementation of PICS and encourage the
development of PICS-compatible Internet applications, Microsystems maintains a
server on the Internet which contains its CyberNOT list.  The server provides
software developers with access to a PICS rating service, and allows software
developers to test their products' ability to interpret standard PICS labels. 
Microsystems is also offering its PICS client test program for Windows free of
charge.  The client program can be used by developers of PICS rating services to
test their services and products.  </P>
<H1>SurfWatch</H1>
<P>66. Another software product, SurfWatch, is also designed to allow parents
and other concerned users to filter unwanted material on the Internet. 
SurfWatch is available for both Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and
Microsoft Windows 95 Operating Systems, and works with direct Internet Access
Providers (e.g., Netcom, PSI, UUnet, AT&amp;T, and more than 1000 other Internet
Service Providers).  </P>
<P>67. The suggested retail price of SurfWatch Software is $49.95, with a
street price of between $20.00 and $25.00.  The product is also available as
part of CompuServe/Spry Inc.'s Internet in a Box for Kids, which includes access
to Spry's Kids only Internet service and a copy of SurfWatch.  Internet in a Box
for Kids retails for approximately $30.00.  The subscription service, which
updates the SurfWatch blocked site list automatically with new sites each month,
is available for $5.95 per month or $60.00 per year.  The subscription is
included as part of the Internet in a Box for Kids program, and is also provided
as a low-cost option from Internet Service Providers.  </P>
<P>68. SurfWatch is available at over 12,000 retail locations, including
National stores such as Comp USA, Egghead Software, Computer City, and several
national mail order outlets.  SurfWatch can also be ordered directly from its
own site on the World Wide Web, and through the Internet Shopping Network.</P>
<P>69.  Plaintiffs America Online (AOL), Microsoft Network, and Prodigy all
offer parental control options free of charge to their members.  AOL has
established an online area designed specifically for children.  The &quot;Kids
Only&quot; parental control feature allows parents to establish an AOL account
for their children that accesses only the Kids Only channel on America
Online.(15)     </P>
<P>70.  AOL plans to incorporate PICS-compatible capability into its standard
Web browser software, and to make available to subscribers other PICS-compatible
Web browsers, such as the Netscape software.  </P>
<P>71. Plaintiffs CompuServe and Prodigy give their subscribers the option of
blocking all access to the Internet, or to particular media within their
proprietary online content, such as bulletin boards and chat rooms. </P>
<P>72. Although parental control software currently can screen for certain
suggestive words or for known sexually explicit sites, it cannot now screen for
sexually explicit images unaccompanied by suggestive text unless those who
configure the software are aware of the particular site.    </P>
<P>73. Despite its limitations, currently available user-based software
suggests that a reasonably effective method by which parents can prevent their
children from accessing sexually explicit and other material which parents may
believe is inappropriate for their children will soon be widely available.</P>
<H1>Content on the Internet</H1>
<P>74. The types of content now on the Internet defy easy classification.  The
entire card catalogue of the Carnegie Library is on-line, together with
journals, journal abstracts, popular magazines, and titles of compact discs. 
The director of the Carnegie Library, Robert Croneberger, testified that on-line
services are the emerging trend in libraries generally.  Plaintiff Hotwired
Ventures LLC organizes its Web site into information regarding travel, news and
commentary, arts and entertainment, politics, and types of drinks.  Plaintiff
America Online, Inc., not only creates chat rooms for a broad variety of topics,
but also allows members to create their own chat rooms to suit their own tastes.
 The ACLU uses an America Online chat room as an unmoderated forum for people to
debate civil liberties issues.  Plaintiffs' expert, Scott Bradner,(16) estimated
that 15,000 newsgroups exist today, and he described his own interest in a
newsgroup devoted solely to Formula 1 racing cars.  America Online makes 15,000
bulletin boards available to its subscribers, who post between 200,000 and
250,000 messages each day.  Another plaintiffs' expert, Harold Rheingold,
participates in &quot;virtual communities&quot; that simulate social
interaction.  It is no exaggeration to conclude that the content on the Internet
is as diverse as human thought.  </P>
<P>75. The Internet is not exclusively, or even primarily, a means of
commercial communication.  Many commercial entities maintain Web sites to inform
potential consumers about their goods and services, or to solicit purchases, but
many other Web sites exist solely for the dissemination of non-commercial
information.  The other forms of Internet communication -- e-mail, bulletin
boards, newsgroups, and chat rooms -- frequently have non-commercial goals.  For
the economic and technical reasons set forth in the following paragraphs, the
Internet is an especially attractive means for not-for-profit entities or public
interest groups to reach their desired audiences.  There are examples in the
parties' stipulation of some of the non-commercial uses that the Internet
serves.  Plaintiff Human Rights Watch, Inc., offers information on its Internet
site regarding reported human rights abuses around the world.  Plaintiff
National Writers Union provides a forum for writers on issues of concern to
them.  Plaintiff Stop Prisoner Rape, Inc., posts text, graphics, and statistics
regarding the incidence and prevention of rape in prisons.  Plaintiff Critical
Path AIDS Project, Inc., offers information on safer sex, the transmission of
HIV, and the treatment of AIDS.  </P>
<P>76. Such diversity of content on the Internet is possible because the
Internet provides an easy and inexpensive way for a speaker to reach a large
audience, potentially of millions.  The start-up and operating costs entailed by
communication on the Internet are significantly lower than those associated with
use of other forms of mass communication, such as television, radio, newspapers,
and magazines.  This enables operation of their own Web sites not only by large
companies, such as Microsoft and Time Warner, but also by small, not-for-profit
groups, such as Stop Prisoner Rape and Critical Path AIDS Project.  The
Government's expert, Dr. Dan R. Olsen,(17) agreed that creation of a Web site
would cost between $1,000 and $15,000, with monthly operating costs depending on
one's goals and the Web site's traffic.  Commercial online services such as
America Online allow subscribers to create Web pages free of charge.  Any
Internet user can communicate by posting a message to one of the thousands of
newsgroups and bulletin boards or by engaging in an on-line &quot;chat&quot;,
and thereby reach an audience worldwide that shares an interest in a particular
topic. </P>
<P>77.  The ease of communication through the Internet is facilitated by the
use of hypertext markup language (HTML), which allows for the creation of &quot;hyperlinks&quot;
or &quot;links&quot;.  HTML enables a user to jump from one source to other
related sources by clicking on the link.  A link might take the user from Web
site to Web site, or to other files within a particular Web site.  Similarly, by
typing a request into a search engine, a user can retrieve many different
sources of content related to the search that the creators of the engine have
collected.  </P>
<P>78.  Because of the technology underlying the Internet, the statutory term &quot;content
provider,&quot;(18) which is equivalent to the traditional &quot;speaker,&quot;
may actually be a hybrid of speakers.  Through the use of HTML, for example,
Critical Path and Stop Prisoner Rape link their Web sites to several related
databases, and a user can immediately jump from the home pages of these
organizations to the related databases simply by clicking on a link.  America
Online creates chat rooms for particular discussions but also allows subscribers
to create their own chat rooms.  Similarly, a newsgroup gathers postings on a
particular topic and distributes them to the newsgroup's subscribers.  Users of
the Carnegie Library can read on-line versions of Vanity Fair and Playboy, and
America Online's subscribers can peruse the New York Times, Boating, and other
periodicals.  Critical Path, Stop Prisoner Rape, America Online and the Carnegie
Library all make available content of other speakers over whom they have little
or no editorial control. </P>
<P>79.  Because of the different forms of Internet communication, a user of the
Internet may speak or listen interchangeably, blurring the distinction between &quot;speakers&quot;
and &quot;listeners&quot; on the Internet.  Chat rooms, e-mail, and newsgroups
are interactive forms of communication, providing the user with the opportunity
both to speak and to listen.  </P>
<P>80. It follows that unlike traditional media, the barriers to entry as a
speaker on the Internet do not differ significantly from the barriers to entry
as a listener.  Once one has entered cyberspace, one may engage in the dialogue
that occurs there.  In the argot of the medium, the receiver can and does become
the content provider, and vice-versa.</P>
<P>81. The Internet is therefore a unique and wholly new medium of worldwide
human communication.</P>
<H1>Sexually Explicit Material On the Internet</H1>
<P>82. The parties agree that sexually explicit material exists on the
Internet.  Such material includes text, pictures, and chat, and includes
bulletin boards, newsgroups, and the other forms of Internet communication, and
extends from the modestly titillating to the hardest-core.  </P>
<P>83. There is no evidence that sexually-oriented material is the primary type
of content on this new medium.  Purveyors of such material take advantage of the
same ease of access available to all users of the Internet, including
establishment of a Web site. </P>
<P>84. Sexually explicit material is created, named, and posted in the same
manner as material that is not sexually explicit.  It is possible that a search
engine can accidentally retrieve material of a sexual nature through an
imprecise search, as demonstrated at the hearing.  Imprecise searches may also
retrieve irrelevant material that is not of a sexual nature.  The accidental
retrieval of sexually explicit material is one manifestation of the larger
phenomenon of irrelevant search results. </P>
<P>85. Once a provider posts content on the Internet, it is available to all
other Internet users worldwide.  Similarly, once a user posts a message to a
newsgroup or bulletin board, that message becomes available to all subscribers
to that newsgroup or bulletin board.  For example, when the UCR/California
Museum of Photography posts to its Web site nudes by Edward Weston and Robert
Mapplethorpe to announce that its new exhibit will travel to Baltimore and New
York City, those images are available not only in Los Angeles, Baltimore, and
New York City, but also in Cincinnati, Mobile, or Beijing -- wherever Internet
users live.  Similarly, the safer sex instructions that Critical Path posts to
its Web site, written in street language so that the teenage receiver can
understand them, are available not just in Philadelphia, but also in Provo and
Prague.  A chat room organized by the ACLU to discuss the United States Supreme
Court's  decision in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation would transmit George Carlin's
seven dirty words to anyone who enters.  Messages posted to a newsgroup
dedicated to the Oklahoma City bombing travel to all subscribers to that
newsgroup.  </P>
<P>86.  Once a provider posts its content on the Internet, it cannot prevent
that content from entering any community.  Unlike the newspaper, broadcast
station, or cable system, Internet technology necessarily gives a speaker a
potential worldwide audience.  Because the Internet is a network of networks (as
described above in Findings 1 through 4), any network connected to the Internet
has the capacity to send and receive information to any other network.  Hotwired
Ventures, for example, cannot prevent its materials on mixology from entering
communities that have no interest in that topic.  </P>
<P>87.  Demonstrations at the preliminary injunction hearings showed that it
takes several steps to enter cyberspace.  At the most fundamental level, a user
must have access to a computer with the ability to reach the Internet (typically
by way of a modem).  A user must then direct the computer to connect with the
access provider, enter a password, and enter the appropriate commands to find
particular data.  On the World Wide Web, a user must normally use a search
engine or enter an appropriate address.  Similarly, accessing newsgroups,
bulletin boards, and chat rooms requires several steps.</P>
<P>88. Communications over the Internet do not &quot;invade&quot; an
individual's home or appear on one's computer screen unbidden.  Users seldom
encounter content &quot;by accident.&quot;   A document's title or a description
of the document will usually appear before the document itself takes the step
needed to view it, and in many cases the user will receive detailed information
about a site's content before he or she need take the step to access the
document.  Almost all sexually explicit images are preceded by warnings as to
the content.  Even the Government's witness, Agent Howard Schmidt, Director of
the Air Force Office of Special Investigation, testified that the &quot;odds are
slim&quot; that a user would come across a sexually explicit site by accident. 
</P>
<P>89. Evidence adduced at the hearing showed significant  differences between
Internet communications and communications received by radio or television. 
Although content on the Internet is just a few clicks of a mouse away from the
user,  the receipt of information on the Internet requires a series of
affirmative steps more deliberate and directed than merely turning a dial.  A
child requires some sophistication and some ability to read to retrieve material
and thereby to use the Internet unattended.  </P>
<H1>Obstacles to Age Verification on the Internet</H1>
<P>90.  There is no effective way to determine the identity or the age of a
user who is accessing material through e-mail, mail exploders, newsgroups or
chat rooms.  An e-mail address provides no authoritative information about the
addressee, who may use an e-mail &quot;alias&quot; or an anonymous remailer. 
There is also no universal or reliable listing of e-mail addresses and
corresponding names or telephone numbers, and any such listing would be or
rapidly become incomplete.  For these reasons, there is no reliable way in many
instances for a sender to know if the e-mail recipient is an adult or a minor. 
The difficulty of e-mail age verification is compounded for mail exploders such
as listservs, which automatically send information to all e-mail addresses on a
sender's list.  Government expert Dr. Olsen agreed that no current technology
could give a speaker assurance that only adults were listed in a particular mail
exploder's mailing list.  </P>
<P>91.  Because of similar technological difficulties, individuals posting a
message to a newsgroup or engaging in chat room discussions cannot ensure that
all readers are adults, and Dr. Olsen agreed.  Although some newsgroups are
moderated, the moderator's control is limited to what is posted and the
moderator cannot control who receives the messages.  </P>
<P>92.  The Government offered no evidence that there is a reliable way to
ensure that recipients and participants in such fora can be screened for age. 
The Government presented no evidence demonstrating the feasibility of its
suggestion that chat rooms, newsgroups and other fora that contain material
deemed indecent could be effectively segregated to &quot;adult&quot; or &quot;moderated&quot;
areas of cyberspace.  </P>
<P>93.  Even if it were technologically feasible to block minors' access to
newsgroups and similar fora, there is no method by which the creators of
newsgroups which contain discussions of art, politics or any other subject that
could potentially elicit &quot;indecent&quot; contributions could limit the
blocking of access by minors to such &quot;indecent&quot; material and still
allow them access to the remaining content, even if the overwhelming majority of
that content was not indecent.</P>
<P>94.  Likewise, participants in MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) and  MUSEs
(Multi-User Simulation Environments) do not know whether the other participants
are adults or minors.  Although MUDs and MUSEs require a password for permanent
participants, they need not give their real name nor verify their age, and there
is no current technology to enable the administrator of these fantasy worlds to
know if the participant is an adult or a minor.  </P>
<P>95.  Unlike other forms of communication on the Internet, there is
technology by which an operator of a World Wide Web server may interrogate a
user of a Web site.  An HTML document can include a fill-in-the-blank &quot;form&quot;
to request information from a visitor to a Web site, and this information can be
transmitted back to the Web server and be processed by a computer program,
usually a Common Gateway Interface (cgi) script.  The Web server could then

grant or deny access to the information sought.  The cgi script is the means by
which a Web site can process a fill-in form and thereby screen visitors by
requesting a credit card number or adult password.</P>
<P>96.  Content providers who publish on the World Wide Web via one of the
large commercial online services, such as America Online or CompuServe, could
not use an online age verification system that requires cgi script because the
server software of these online services available to subscribers cannot process
cgi scripts.  There is no method currently available for Web page publishers who
lack access to cgi scripts to screen recipients online for age.</P>
<H1>The Practicalities of the Proffered Defenses</H1>
<P>Note:  The Government contends the CDA makes available three potential
defenses to all content providers on the Internet:  credit card verification,
adult verification by password or adult identification number, and &quot;tagging&quot;.</P>
<H1>Credit Card Verification </H1>
<P>97.  Verification(19) of a credit card number over the Internet is not now
technically possible.  Witnesses testified that neither Visa nor Mastercard
considers the Internet to be sufficiently secure under the current technology to
process transactions in that manner.  Although users can and do purchase
products over the Internet by transmitting their credit card number, the seller
must then process the transaction with Visa or Mastercard off-line using phone
lines in the traditional way.  There was testimony by several witnesses that
Visa and Mastercard are in the process of developing means of credit card
verification over the Internet.  </P>
<P>98. Verification by credit card, if and when operational, will remain
economically and practically unavailable for many of the non-commercial
plaintiffs in these actions.  The Government's expert &quot;suspect[ed]&quot;
that verification agencies would decline to process a card unless it accompanied
a commercial transaction.  There was no evidence to the contrary.  </P>
<P>99. There was evidence that the fee charged by verification agencies to
process a card, whether for a purchase or not, will preclude use of the

credit-card verification defense by many non-profit, non-commercial Web sites,
and there was no evidence to the contrary.  Plaintiffs' witness Patricia Nell
Warren, an author whose free Web site allows users to purchase gay and lesbian
literature, testified that she must pay $1 per verification to a verification
agency.  Her Web site can absorb this cost because it arises in connection with
the sale of books available there.  </P>
<P>100. Using credit card possession as a surrogate for age, and requiring use
of a credit card to enter a site, would impose a significant economic cost on
non-commercial entities.  Critical Path, for example, received 3,300 hits daily
from February 4 through March 4, 1996.  If Critical Path must pay a fee every
time a user initially enters its site, then, to provide free access to its
non-commercial site, it would incur a monthly cost far beyond its modest
resources.  The ACLU's Barry Steinhardt testified that maintenance of a credit
card verification system for all visitors to the ACLU's Web site would require
it to shut down its Web site because the projected cost would exceed its budget.
</P>
<P>101. Credit card verification would significantly delay the retrieval of
information on the Internet.  Dr. Olsen, the expert testifying for the
Government, agreed that even &quot;a minute is [an] absolutely unreasonable
[delay] . . . [P]eople will not put up with a minute.&quot;  Plaintiffs' expert
Donna Hoffman similarly testified that excessive delay disrupts the &quot;flow&quot;
on the Internet and stifles both &quot;hedonistic&quot; and &quot;goal-directed&quot;
browsing. </P>
<P>102.  Imposition of a credit card requirement would completely bar adults
who do not have a credit card and lack the resources to obtain one from
accessing any blocked material.  At this time, credit card verification is
effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet content providers as
a potential defense to the CDA.</P>
<H1>Adult Verification by Password </H1>
<P>103.  The Government offered very limited evidence regarding the operation
of existing age verification systems, and the evidence offered was not based on
personal knowledge.  AdultCheck and Verify, existing systems which appear to be
used for accessing commercial pornographic sites, charge users for their
services.  Dr. Olsen admitted that his knowledge of these services was derived
primarily from reading the advertisements on their Web pages.  He had not
interviewed any employees of these entities, had not personally used these
systems, had no idea how many people are registered with them, and could not
testify to the reliability of their attempt at age verification.  </P>
<P>104.  At least some, if not almost all, non-commercial organizations, such
as the ACLU, Stop Prisoner Rape or Critical Path AIDS Project, regard charging
listeners to access their speech as contrary to their goals of making their
materials available to a wide audience free of charge.  </P>
<P>105.  It would not be feasible for many non-commercial organizations to
design their own adult access code screening systems because the administrative
burden of creating and maintaining a screening system and the ongoing costs
involved is beyond their reach.  There was testimony that the costs would be
prohibitive even for a commercial entity such as HotWired, the online version of
Wired magazine.  </P>
<P>106.  There is evidence suggesting that adult users, particularly casual Web
browsers, would be discouraged from retrieving information that required use of
a credit card or password.  Andrew Anker testified that HotWired has received
many complaints from its members about HotWired's registration system, which

requires only that a member supply a name, e-mail address and self-created
password.  There is concern by commercial content providers that age
verification requirements would decrease advertising and revenue because
advertisers depend on a demonstration that the sites are widely available and
frequently visited.  </P>
<P>107.  Even if credit card verification or adult password verification were
implemented, the Government presented no testimony as to how such systems could
ensure that the user of the password or credit card is in fact over 18.  The
burdens imposed by credit card verification and adult password verification
systems make them effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet
content providers.</P>
<H1> The Government's &quot;Tagging&quot; Proposal</H1>
<P>108. The feasibility and effectiveness of &quot;tagging&quot; to restrict
children from accessing &quot;indecent&quot; speech, as proposed by the
Government has not been established.  &quot;Tagging&quot; would require content
providers to label all of their &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive&quot;
material by imbedding a string of characters, such as &quot;XXX,&quot; in either
the URL or HTML.  If a user could install software on his or her computer to
recognize the &quot;XXX&quot; tag, the user could screen out any content with
that tag.  Dr. Olsen proposed a &quot;-L18&quot; tag, an idea he developed for
this hearing in response to Mr. Bradner's earlier testimony that certain tagging
would not be feasible.</P>
<P>109. The parties appear to agree that it is technologically feasible -- &quot;trivial&quot;,
in the words of plaintiffs' expert -- to imbed tags in URLs and HTML, and the
technology of tagging underlies both plaintiffs' PICS proposal and the
Government's &quot;-L18&quot; proposal.</P>
<P>110. The Government's tagging proposal would require all content providers
that post arguably &quot;indecent&quot; material to review all of their online
content, a task that would be extremely burdensome for organizations that
provide large amounts of material online which cannot afford to pay a large
staff to review all of that material.  The Carnegie Library would be required to
hire numerous additional employees to review its on-line files at an extremely
high cost to its limited budget.  The cost and effort would be substantial for
the Library and frequently prohibitive for others.  Witness Kiroshi Kuromiya
testified that it would be impossible for his organization, Critical Path, to
review all of its material because it has only one full and one part-time
employee.  </P>
<P>111.  The task of screening and tagging cannot be done simply by using
software which screens for certain words, as Dr. Olsen acknowledged, and we find
that determinations as to what is indecent require human judgment.  </P>
<P>112.  In lieu of reviewing each file individually, a content provider could
tag its entire site but this would prevent minors from accessing much material
that is not &quot;indecent&quot; under the CDA.  </P>
<P>113.  To be effective, a scheme such as the -L18 proposal would require a
worldwide consensus among speakers to use the same tag to label &quot;indecent&quot;
material.  There is currently no such consensus, and no Internet speaker
currently labels its speech with the -L18 code or with any other
widely-recognized label.</P>
<P>114. Tagging also assumes the existence of software that recognizes the tags
and takes appropriate action when it notes tagged speech.  Neither commercial
Web browsers nor user-based screening software is currently configured to block
a -L18 code.  Until such software exists, all speech on the Internet will
continue to travel to whomever requests it, without hindrance.  Labelling speech
has no effect in itself on the transmission (or not) of that speech.  Neither
plaintiffs nor the Government suggest that tagging alone would shield minors
from speech or insulate a speaker from criminal liability under the CDA. It
follows that all speech on any topic that is available to adults will also be
available to children using the Internet (unless it is blocked by screening
software running on the computer the child is using).  </P>
<P>115. There is no way that a speaker can use current technology to know if a
listener is using screening software.  </P>
<P>116. Tags can not currently activate or deactivate themselves depending on
the age or location of the receiver.  Critical Path, which posts on-line safer
sex instructions, would be unable to imbed tags that block its speech only in
communities where it may be regarded as indecent.  Critical Path, for example,
must choose either to tag its site (blocking its speech in all communities) or
not to tag, blocking its speech in none. </P>
<H1>The Problems of Offshore Content and Caching</H1>
<P>117. A large percentage, perhaps 40% or more, of content on the Internet
originates outside the United States.  At the hearing, a witness demonstrated
how an Internet user could access a Web site of London (which presumably is on a
server in England), and then link to other sites of interest in England.  A user
can sometimes discern from a URL that content is coming from overseas, since
InterNIC allows a content provider to imbed a country code in a domain name.(20)
 Foreign content is otherwise indistinguishable from domestic content (as long
as it is in English), since foreign speech is created, named, and posted in the
same manner as domestic speech.  There is no requirement that foreign speech
contain a country code in its URL.  It is undisputed that some foreign speech
that travels over the Internet is sexually explicit.</P>
<P>118. The use of &quot;caching&quot; makes it difficult to determine whether
the material originated from foreign or domestic sources.  Because of the high
cost of using the trans- Atlantic and trans-Pacific cables, and because the high
demand on those cables leads to bottleneck delays, content is often &quot;cached&quot;,
or temporarily stored, on servers in the United States.  Material from a foreign
source in Europe can travel over the trans-Atlantic cable to the receiver in the
United States, and pass through a domestic caching server which then stores a
copy for subsequent retrieval.  This domestic caching server, rather than the
original foreign server, will send the material from the cache to the subsequent
receivers, without placing a demand on the trans-oceanic cables.  This shortcut
effectively eliminates most of the distance for both the request and the
information and, hence, most of the delay.  The caching server discards the
stored information according to its configuration (e.g., after a certain time or
as the demand for the information diminishes).  Caching therefore advances core
Internet values:  the cheap and speedy retrieval of information.</P>
<P>119. Caching is not merely an international phenomenon.  Domestic content
providers store popular domestic material on their caching servers to avoid the
delay of successive searches for the same material and to decrease the demand on
their Internet connection.  America Online can cache the home page of the New
York Times on its servers when a subscriber first requests it, so that
subsequent subscribers who make the same request will receive the same home
page, but from America Online's caching service rather than from the New York
Times's server.(21)  </P>
<P>120. Put simply, to follow the example in the prior paragraph, America
Online has no control over the content that the New York Times posts to its Web
site, and the New York Times has no control over America Online's distribution
of that content from a caching server.</P>
<H1>Anonymity</H1>
<P>121. Anonymity is important to Internet users who seek to access sensitive
information, such as users of the Critical Path AIDS Project's Web site, the
users, particularly gay youth, of Queer Resources Directory, and users of Stop
Prisoner Rape (SPR).  Many members of SPR's mailing list have asked to remain
anonymous due to the stigma of prisoner rape.  </P>
<H1>Plaintiffs' Choices Under the CDA</H1>
<P>122. Many speakers who display arguably indecent content on the Internet
must choose between silence and the risk of prosecution.  The CDA's defenses --
credit card verification, adult access codes, and adult personal identification
numbers -- are effectively unavailable for non-commercial, not-for-profit
entities.</P>
<P>123.  The plaintiffs in this action are businesses, libraries,
non-commercial and not-for-profit organizations, and educational societies and
consortia.  Although some of the material that plaintiffs post online -- such as
information regarding protection from AIDS, birth control or prison rape -- is
sexually explicit and may be considered &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently
offensive&quot; in some communities, none of the plaintiffs is a commercial
purveyor of what is commonly termed &quot;pornography.&quot;  </P>
<H1>III.</H1>
<H1>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</H1>
<P>Plaintiffs have established a reasonable probability of eventual success in
the litigation by demonstrating that &#167;&#167; 223(a)(1)(B) and 223(a)(2) of
the CDA are unconstitutional on their face to the extent that they reach
indecency.  Sections 223(d)(1) and 223(d)(2) of the CDA are unconstitutional on
their face.  Accordingly, plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury, no party has
any interest in the enforcement of an unconstitutional law, and therefore the
public interest will be served by granting the preliminary injunction.  Elrod v.
Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74 (1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.),
cert. denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989); Acierno v. New Castle County, 40 F.3d 645,
653 (3d Cir. 1994).  The motions for preliminary injunction will therefore be
granted.</P>
<P>The views of the members of the Court in support of these conclusions
follow.</P>
<HR>
<P>SLOVITER, Chief Judge, Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit:</P>
<H1>A.</H1>
<H1>Statutory Provisions</H1>

<P>As noted in Part I, Introduction, the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary
injunction is confined to portions of two provisions of the Communications
Decency Act of 1996, &#167; 223(a) and &#167; 223(d), which they contend violate
their First Amendment free speech and Fifth Amendment due process rights.  To
facilitate reference, I set forth those provisions in full.  Section 223(a), the
&quot;indecency&quot; provision, subjects to criminal penalties of imprisonment
of no more than two years or a fine or both anyone who:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>1) in interstate or foreign communications . . . </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(B) by means of a telecommunications device </P>
<P>knowingly --  </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(i) makes, creates, or solicits, and</P>
<P>(ii) initiates the transmission of, </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication
which is obscene or indecent, knowing that the recipient of the communication is
under 18 years of age, regardless of whether the maker of such communication
placed the call or initiated the communication; . . . </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under his control to
be used for any activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be
used for such activity.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(emphasis added).</P>
<P>The term &quot;telecommunications device&quot; is specifically defined not
to include &quot;the use of an interactive computer service,&quot; as that is
covered by section 223(d)(1).</P>
<P>Section 223(d), the &quot;patently offensive&quot; provision, subjects to
criminal penalties anyone who:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(1) in interstate or foreign communications knowingly--</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(A) uses an interactive computer service to send to a specific person or
persons under 18 years of age, or</P>
<P>(B) uses any interactive computer service to display in a manner available
to a person under 18 years of age, any comment, request, suggestion, proposal,
image or other communication that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms
patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or
excretory activities or organs, regardless of whether the use of such service
placed the call or initiated the communication; or </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under such person's
control to be used for an activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent
that it be used for such activity.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(emphasis added).</P>
<P>Two aspects of these provisions stand out.  First, we are dealing with
criminal provisions, subjecting violators to substantial penalties.  Second, the
provisions on indecent and patently offensive communications are not parallel.</P>
<P>The government uses the term &quot;indecent&quot; interchangeably with &quot;patently
offensive&quot; and advises that it so construes the statute in light of the
legislative history and the Supreme Court's analysis of the word &quot;indecent&quot;
in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).  However,  the CDA does not
define &quot;indecent.&quot;  Notwithstanding Congress' familiarity with
Pacifica, it enacted &#167; 223(a), covering &quot;indecent&quot;
communications, without any language confining &quot;indecent&quot; to
descriptions or depictions of &quot;sexual or excretory activities or organs,&quot;
language it included in the reference to &quot;patently offensive&quot; in &#167;
223(d)(1)(B).  Nor does &#167; 223(a) contain the phrase &quot;in context,&quot;
which the government believes is relevant.  </P>
<P>The failure to define &quot;indecent&quot; in &#167; 223(a) is thus arguably
a negative pregnant and subject to &quot;the rule of construction that an
express statutory requirement here, contrasted with statutory silence there,
shows an intent to confine the requirement to the specified instance.&quot; 
Field v. Mans, 116 S.Ct. 437, 442 (1995).  See also Gozlon-Peretz v. United
States, 498 U.S. 395, 404 (1991) (&quot;'[W]here Congress includes particular
language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same
Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in
the disparate inclusion or exclusion'&quot;) (quoting Russello v. United States,
464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)).  </P>
<P>Plaintiffs note the difference but do not press this as a basis for
distinguishing between the two sections in their preliminary injunction
arguments and therefore I will also use the words interchangeably for this
purpose, leaving open the issue for consideration at the final judgment stage if
it becomes relevant.</P>
<H1>B.</H1>
<H1>Preliminary Injunction Standard</H1>
<P>To obtain a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs must establish that they are
likely to prevail on the merits and that they will suffer irreparable harm if
injunctive relief is not granted.  We also must consider whether the potential
harm to the defendant from issuance of a temporary restraining order outweighs
possible harm to the plaintiffs if such relief is denied, and whether the
granting of injunctive relief is in the public interest.  See Campbell Soup Co.
v. ConAgra, Inc., 977 F.2d 86, 90-91 (3d Cir. 1992); Bradley v. Pittsburgh Bd.
of Educ., 910 F.2d 1172, 1175 (3d Cir. 1990).</P>
<P>In a case in which the injury alleged is a threat to First Amendment
interests, the finding of irreparable injury is often tied to the likelihood of
success on the merits.  In Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976), the Supreme
Court emphasized that &quot;the loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even
minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.&quot; 
Id. at 373 (citing New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)).</P>
<P>Subjecting speakers to criminal penalties for speech that is
constitutionally protected in itself raises the spectre of irreparable harm. 
Even if a court were unwilling to draw that conclusion from the language of the
statute itself, plaintiffs have introduced ample evidence that the challenged
provisions, if not enjoined, will have a chilling effect on their free
expression.  Thus, this is not a case in which we are dealing with a mere
incidental inhibition on speech, see Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 73 (3d Cir.),
cert. denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989), but with a regulation that directly penalizes
speech.</P>
<P>Nor could there be any dispute about the public interest factor which must
be taken into account before a court grants a preliminary injunction.  No long
string of citations is necessary to find that the public interest weighs in
favor of having access to a free flow of constitutionally protected speech. 
See, e.g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2458
(1994); Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S.
748, 763-65 (1976).  </P>
<P>Thus, if plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits, they
will have shown the irreparable injury needed to entitle them to a preliminary
injunction.</P>
<H1>C.</H1>
<H1>Applicable Standard of Review</H1>
<P>The CDA is patently a government-imposed content-based restriction on

speech, and the speech at issue, whether denominated &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently
offensive,&quot; is entitled to constitutional protection.  See Sable

Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989).  As such,
the regulation is subject to strict scrutiny, and will only be upheld if it is
justified by a compelling government interest and if it is narrowly tailored to
effectuate that interest.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 126; see also Turner Broadcasting,
114 S. Ct. at 2459 (1994).  &quot;[T]he benefit gained [by a content-based
restriction] must outweigh the loss of constitutionally protected rights.&quot; 
Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. at 363.</P>
<P>The government's position on the applicable standard has been less than
pellucid but, despite some references to a somewhat lesser burden employed in
broadcasting cases, it now appears to have conceded that it has the burden of
proof to show both a compelling interest and that the statute regulates least
restrictively.  Tr. of Preliminary Injunction Hearing at 121 (May 10, 1996).  In
any event, the evidence and our Findings of Fact based thereon show that
Internet communication, while unique, is more akin to telephone communication,
at issue in Sable, than to broadcasting, at issue in Pacifica, because, as with
the telephone, an Internet user must act affirmatively and deliberately to
retrieve specific information online.  Even if a broad search will, on occasion,
retrieve unwanted materials, the user virtually always receives some warning of
its content, significantly reducing the element of surprise or &quot;assault&quot;
involved in broadcasting.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a very young
child will be randomly &quot;surfing&quot; the Web and come across &quot;indecent&quot;

or &quot;patently offensive&quot; material.  </P>
<P>Judge Dalzell's separate opinion fully explores the reasons for the
differential treatment of radio and television broadcasting for First Amendment
purposes from that accorded other means of communication.  It follows that to
the extent the Court employed a less than strict scrutiny standard of review in
Pacifica and other broadcasting cases, see, e.g., Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v.
FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), there is no reason to employ a less than strict
scrutiny standard of review in this case.</P>
<H1>D.</H1>
<H1>The Nature of the Government's Interest</H1>
<P>The government asserts that shielding minors from access to indecent
materials is the compelling interest supporting the CDA.  It cites in support
the statements of the Supreme Court that &quot;[i]t is evident beyond the need
for elaboration that a State's interest in `safeguarding the physical and
psychological well-being of a minor' is `compelling,'&quot;  New York v. Ferber,
458 U.S. 747, 757 (1982)(quoting Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S.
596, 607 (1982)), and &quot;there is a compelling interest in protecting the
physical and psychological well-being of minors.  This interest extends to
shielding minors from the influence of literature that is not obscene by adult
standards.&quot;  Sable, 492 U.S at 126.  It also cites the similar quotation
appearing in Fabulous Assoc., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm'n, 896
F.2d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 1990). </P>
<P>Those statements were made in cases where the potential harm to children
from the material was evident.  Ferber involved the constitutionality of a
statute which prohibited persons from knowingly promoting sexual performances by
children under 16 and distributing material depicting such performances.  Sable
and Fabulous involved the FCC's ban on &quot;dial-a-porn&quot; (dealing by
definition with pornographic telephone messages).  In contrast to the material
at issue in those cases, at least some of the material subject to coverage under
the &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot; provisions of the
CDA may contain valuable literary, artistic or educational information of value
to older minors as well as adults.  The Supreme Court has held that &quot;minors
are entitled to a significant measure of First Amendment protection, and only in
relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public
dissemination of protected materials to them.&quot;  Erznoznik v. City of
Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212-213 (1975)(citations omitted).  </P>
<P>In Erznoznik, the Court rejected an argument that an ordinance prohibiting

the display of films containing nudity at drive-in movie theatres served a
compelling interest in protecting minor passersby from the influence of such
films.  The Court held that the prohibition was unduly broad, and explained that
&quot;[s]peech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other
legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from
ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.&quot;  422
U.S. at 213-14.  As Justice Scalia noted in Sable, &quot;[t]he more pornographic
what is embraced within the . . .  category of `indecency,' the more reasonable
it becomes to insist upon greater assurance of insulation from minors.&quot; 
Sable, 492 U.S. at 132 (Scalia, J., concurring).  It follows that where
non-pornographic, albeit sexually explicit, material also falls within the sweep
of the statute, the interest will not be as compelling.  </P>
<P>In part, our consideration of the government's showing of a &quot;compelling
interest&quot; trenches upon the vagueness issue, discussed in detail in Judge
Buckwalter's opinion but equally pertinent to First Amendment analysis. 
Material routinely acceptable according to the standards of New York City, such
as the Broadway play Angels in America which concerns homosexuality and AIDS
portrayed in graphic language, may be far less acceptable in smaller, less
cosmopolitan communities of the United States.  Yet the play garnered two Tony
Awards and a Pulitzer prize for its author, and some uninhibited parents and
teachers might deem it to be material to be read or assigned to eleventh and

twelfth graders.  If available on the Internet through some libraries, the text
of the play would likely be accessed in that manner by at least some students,
and it would also arguably fall within the scope of the CDA.</P>
<P>There has been recent public interest in the female genital mutilation
routinely practiced and officially condoned in some countries.  News articles
have been descriptive, and it is not stretching to assume that this is a subject
that occupies news groups and chat rooms on the Internet.  We have no assurance
that these discussions, of obvious interest and relevance to older teenage
girls, will not be viewed as patently offensive - even in context - in some
communities.</P>
<P>Other illustrations abound of non-obscene material likely to be available on
the Internet but subject to the CDA's criminal provisions.  Photographs
appearing in National Geographic or a travel magazine of the sculptures in India
of couples copulating in numerous positions, a written description of a brutal
prison rape, or Francesco Clemente's painting &quot;Labirinth,&quot; see Def.
Exh. 125, all might be considered to &quot;depict or describe, in terms patently
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
activities or organs.&quot;  47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(d)(1).  But the government has
made no showing that it has a compelling interest in preventing a
seventeen-year-old minor from accessing such images.  </P>
<P>By contrast, plaintiffs presented testimony that material that could be
considered indecent, such as that offered by Stop Prisoner Rape or Critical Path
AIDS project, may be critically important for certain older minors.  For
example, there was testimony that one quarter of all new HIV infections in the
United States is estimated to occur in young people between the ages of 13 and
20, an estimate the government made no effort to rebut.  The witnesses believed
that graphic material that their organizations post on the Internet could help
save lives, but were concerned about the CDA's effect on their right to do so.</P>
<P>The government counters that this court should defer to legislative
conclusions about this matter.  However, where First Amendment rights are at
stake, &quot;[d]eference to a legislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry.&quot;
Sable, 492 U.S. at 129 (quoting Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435
U.S. 829, 843 (1978)).  &quot;[W]hatever deference is due legislative findings
would not foreclose our independent judgment of the facts bearing on an issue of
constitutional law.&quot;  Id. </P>
<P>Moreover, it appears that the legislative &quot;findings&quot; the

government cites concern primarily testimony and statements by legislators about

the prevalence of obscenity, child pornography, and sexual solicitation of
children on the Internet.  Similarly, at the hearings before us the government
introduced exhibits of sexually explicit material through the testimony of Agent
Howard Schmidt, which consisted primarily of the same type of hard-core
pornographic materials (even if not technically obscene) which concerned
Congress and which fill the shelves of &quot;adult&quot; book and magazine
stores.  Plaintiffs emphasize that they do not challenge the Act's restrictions
on speech not protected by the First Amendment, such as obscenity, child
pornography or harassment of children.  Their suit is based on their assertion,
fully supported by their evidence and our findings, that the CDA reaches much
farther.</P>
<P>I am far less confident than the government that its quotations from earlier
cases in the Supreme Court signify that it has shown a compelling interest in
regulating the vast range of online material covered or potentially covered by
the CDA.  Nonetheless, I acknowledge that there is certainly a compelling
government interest to shield a substantial number of minors from some of the
online material that motivated Congress to enact the CDA, and do not rest my
decision on the inadequacy of the government's showing in this regard.</P>
<H1>E.</H1>
<H1>The Reach of the Statute</H1>
<P>Whatever the strength of the interest the government has demonstrated in
preventing minors from accessing &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;patently
offensive&quot; material online, if the means it has chosen sweeps more broadly
than necessary and thereby chills the expression of adults, it has overstepped
onto rights protected by the First Amendment.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 131.  </P>
<P>The plaintiffs argue that the CDA violates the First Amendment because it
effectively bans a substantial category of protected speech from most parts of
the Internet.  The  government responds that the Act does not on its face or in
effect ban indecent material that is constitutionally protected for adults. 
Thus one of the factual issues before us was the likely effect of the CDA on the
free availability of constitutionally protected material.  A wealth of
persuasive evidence, referred to in detail in the Findings of Fact, proved that
it is either technologically impossible or economically prohibitive for many of
the plaintiffs to comply with the CDA without seriously impeding their posting
of online material which adults have a constitutional right to access.</P>
<P>With the possible exception of an e-mail to a known recipient, most content
providers cannot determine the identity and age of every user accessing their
material.  Considering separately content providers that fall roughly into two
categories, we have found that no technology exists which allows those posting
on the category of newsgroups, mail exploders or chat rooms to screen for age. 
Speakers using those forms of communication cannot control who receives the
communication, and in most instances are not aware of the identity of the
recipients.  If it is not feasible for speakers who communicate via these forms

of communication to conduct age screening, they would have to reduce the level
of communication to that which is appropriate for children in order to be
protected under the statute.   This would effect a complete ban even for adults
of some expression, albeit &quot;indecent,&quot; to which they are
constitutionally entitled, and thus would be unconstitutional under the holding
in Sable, 492 U.S. at 131.</P>
<P>Even as to content providers in the other broad category, such as the World
Wide Web, where efforts at age verification are technically feasible through the
use of Common Gateway Interface (cgi) scripts (which enable creation of a
document that can process information provided by a Web visitor), the Findings
of Fact show that as a practical matter, non-commercial organizations and even
many commercial organizations using the Web would find it prohibitively
expensive and burdensome to engage in the methods of age verification proposed
by the government, and that even if they could attempt to age verify, there is
little assurance that they could successfully filter out minors.</P>
<P>The government attempts to circumvent this problem by seeking to limit the
scope of the statute to those content providers who are commercial
pornographers, and urges that we do likewise in our obligation to save a
congressional enactment from facial unconstitutionality wherever possible.  But
in light of its plain language and its legislative history, the CDA cannot
reasonably be read as limited to commercial pornographers.  A court may not
impose a narrowing construction on a statute unless it is &quot;readily
susceptible&quot; to such a construction.  Virginia v. American Booksellers

Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 397 (1988).  The court may not &quot;rewrite a . . . law to

conform it to constitutional requirements.&quot;  Id.  Although we may prefer an

interpretation of a statute that will preserve the constitutionality of the
statutory scheme, United State v. Clark, 445 U.S. 23, 27 (1980), we do not have
license to rewrite a statute to &quot;create distinctions where none were
intended.&quot;  American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 72 n.6 (1982);
see also Consumer Party v. Davis, 778 F.2d 140, 147 (3d Cir. 1985).  The Court
has often stated that &quot;absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to
the contrary, [statutory] language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.&quot;
 Escondido Mut. Water Co. v. La Jolla Band of Mission Indians, 466 U.S. 765, 772
(1984)(quoting North Dakota v. United States, 460 U.S. 300, 312 (1983)).</P>
<P>It is clear from the face of the CDA and from its legislative history that
Congress did not intend to limit its application to commercial purveyors of
pornography.  Congress unquestionably knew how to limit the statute to such
entities if that was its intent, and in fact it did so in provisions relating to
dial-a-porn services.  See 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(b)(2)(A) (criminalizing making
any indecent telephone communication &quot;for commercial purposes&quot;).  It
placed no similar limitation in the CDA.  Moreover, the Conference Report makes
clear that Congress did not intend to limit the application of the statute to
content providers such as those which make available the commercial material
contained in the government's exhibits, and confirms that Congress intended &quot;content
regulation of both commercial and non-commercial providers.&quot;  Conf. Rep. at
191.  See also, 141 Cong. Rec. S8089 (daily ed. June 9, 1995) (Statement of
Senator Exon).     </P>
<P>The scope of the CDA is not confined to material that has a prurient
interest or appeal, one of the hallmarks of obscenity, because Congress sought
to reach farther.  Nor did Congress include language that would define &quot;patently
offensive&quot; or &quot;indecent&quot; to exclude material of serious value. 
It follows that to narrow the statute in the manner the government urges would
be an impermissible exercise of our limited judicial function, which is to
review the statute as written for its compliance with constitutional mandates.  
 </P>
<P>I conclude inexorably from the foregoing that the CDA reaches speech subject
to the full protection of the First Amendment, at least for adults.(1)  In
questions of the witnesses and in colloquy with the government attorneys, it
became evident that even if &quot;indecent&quot; is read as parallel to &quot;patently
offensive,&quot; the terms would cover a broad range of material from
contemporary films, plays and books showing or describing sexual activities
(e.g., Leaving Las Vegas) to controversial contemporary art and photographs
showing sexual organs in positions that the government conceded would be
patently offensive in some communities (e.g., a Robert Mapplethorpe photograph
depicting a man with an erect penis). </P>
<P>We have also found that there is no effective way for many Internet content
providers to limit the effective reach of the CDA to adults because there is no
realistic way for many providers to ascertain the age of those accessing their
materials.  As a consequence, we have found that &quot;[m]any speakers who
display arguably indecent content on the Internet must choose between silence
and the risk of prosecution.&quot;  Such a choice, forced by sections 223(a) and
(d) of the CDA, strikes at the heart of speech of adults as well as minors.</P>
<H1>F.</H1>
<H1>Whether CDA is Narrowly Tailored</H1>
<P>In the face of such a patent intrusion on a substantial category of
protected speech for adults, there is some irony in considering whether the
statute is narrowly tailored or, as sometimes put, whether Congress has used the
least restrictive means to achieve a compelling government interest.  See Sable,
492 U.S. at 126.  It would appear that the extent of the abridgement of the
protected speech of adults that it has been shown the CDA would effect is too
intrusive to be outweighed by the government's asserted interest, whatever its
strength, in protecting minors from access to indecent material.  Nonetheless,
the formulation of the inquiry requires that we consider the government's
assertion that the statute is narrowly drafted, and I proceed to do so.  </P>
<P>In this case, the government relies on the statutory defenses for its
argument of narrow tailoring.  There are a number of reasons why I am not
persuaded that the statutory defenses can save the CDA from a conclusion of
facial unconstitutionality.</P>
<P>First, it is difficult to characterize a criminal statute that hovers over
each content provider, like the proverbial sword of Damocles, as a narrow
tailoring.  Criminal prosecution, which carries with it the risk of public
obloquy as well as the expense of court preparation and attorneys' fees, could
itself cause incalculable harm.  No provider, whether an individual, non-profit
corporation, or even large publicly held corporation, is likely to willingly
subject itself to prosecution for a miscalculation of the prevalent community
standards or for an error in judgment as to what is indecent.  A successful
defense to a criminal prosecution would be small solace indeed.</P>
<P>Credit card and adult verification services are explicitly referred to as
defenses in &#167; 223(e)(5)(B) of the CDA.  As is set forth fully in the
detailed Findings of Fact, these defenses are not technologically or
economically feasible for most providers.  </P>
<P>The government then falls back on the affirmative defense to prosecution
provided in &#167; 223(e)(5)(A) for a person who &quot;has taken, in good faith,
reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under the circumstances to
restrict or prevent access by minors to a communication specified in such
subsections . . . including any method which is feasible under available
technology.&quot;  The government emphasizes that &quot;effective&quot; does not
require 100% restriction, and that this defense is &quot;open-ended&quot; and
requires only reasonable efforts based on current technology.</P>
<P>But, as the evidence made clear, there is no such technology at this time. 
The government proffered as one option that would constitute a valid affirmative
defense under &#167; 223(e)(5)(A) a &quot;tagging&quot; scheme conceived by Dr.
Olsen in response to this lawsuit whereby a string of characters would be
imbedded in all arguably indecent or patently offensive material.  Our Findings
of Fact set forth fully the reasons why we found that the feasibility and
effectiveness of tagging in the manner proposed by the government has not been
established.  All parties agree that tagging alone does nothing to prevent
children from accessing potentially indecent material, because it depends upon
the cooperation of third parties to block the material on which the tags are
embedded.  Yet these third parties, over which the content providers have no
control, are not subject to the CDA.  I do not believe a statute is narrowly
tailored when it subjects to potential criminal penalties those who must depend
upon third parties for the effective operation of a statutory defense.</P>
<P>Most important, the government's &quot;tagging&quot; proposal is purely
hypothetical and offers no currently operative defense to Internet content
providers.  At this time, there is no agreed-upon &quot;tag&quot; in existence,
and no web browsers or user-based screening systems are now configured to block
tagged material.  Nor, significantly, has the government stipulated that a
content provider could avoid liability simply by tagging its material.   </P>
<P>Third, even if the technology catches up, as the government confidently
predicts, there will still be a not insignificant burden attached to effecting a
tagging defense, a burden one should not have to bear in order to transmit
information protected under the constitution.  For example, to effect tagging
content providers must review all of their material currently published online,
as well as all new material they post in the future, to determine if it could be
considered &quot;patently offensive&quot; in any community nationwide.  This
would be burdensome for all providers, but for the many not-for-profit entities
which currently post thousands of Web pages, this burden would be one impossible
to sustain.</P>
<P>Finally, the viability of the defenses is intricately tied to the clarity of
the CDA's scope.  Because, like Judge Buckwalter, and for many of the reasons he
gives, I believe that &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot;
are inherently vague, particularly in light of the government's inability to
identify the relevant community by whose standards the material will be judged,
I am not persuaded by the government that the statutory defenses in &#167;
223(e) provide effective protection from the unconstitutional reach of the
statute.</P>
<P>Minors would not be left without any protection from exposure to patently
unsuitable material on the Internet should the challenged provisions of the CDA
be preliminarily enjoined. Vigorous enforcement of current obscenity and child
pornography laws should suffice to address the problem the government identified
in court and which concerned Congress.  When the CDA was under consideration by
Congress, the Justice Department itself communicated its view that it was not
necessary because it was prosecuting online obscenity, child pornography and
child solicitation under existing laws, and would continue to do so.(2)  It
follows that the CDA is not narrowly tailored, and the government's attempt to

defend it on that ground must fail.</P>
<H1>G.</H1>
<H1>Preliminary Injunction</H1>
<P>When Congress decided that material unsuitable for minors was available on
the Internet, it could have chosen to assist and support the development of
technology that would enable parents, schools, and libraries to screen such
material from their end.  It did not do so, and thus did not follow the example
available in the print media where non-obscene but indecent and patently
offensive books and magazines abound.  Those responsible for minors undertake
the primary obligation to prevent their exposure to such material.  Instead, in
the CDA Congress chose to place on the speakers the obligation of screening the
material that would possibly offend some communities. </P>
<P>Whether Congress' decision was a wise one is not at issue here.  It was
unquestionably a decision that placed the CDA in serious conflict with our most
cherished protection - the right to choose the material to which we would have
access.  </P>
<P>The government makes what I view as an extraordinary argument in its brief. 
It argues that blocking technology needed for effective parental control is not
yet widespread but that it &quot;will imminently be in place.&quot; Government's
Post-hearing Memorandum at 66.  It then states that if we uphold the CDA, it &quot;will
likely unleash the 'creative genius' of the Internet community to find a myriad
of possible solutions.&quot;  I can imagine few arguments less likely to
persuade a court to uphold a criminal statute than one that depends on future
technology to cabin the reach of the statute within constitutional bounds.</P>
<P>The government makes yet another argument that troubles me.  It suggests
that the concerns expressed by the plaintiffs and the questions posed by the
court reflect an exaggerated supposition of how it would apply the law, and that
we should, in effect, trust the Department of Justice to limit the CDA's
application in a reasonable fashion that would avoid prosecution for placing on
the Internet works of serious literary or artistic merit.  That would require a
broad trust indeed from a generation of judges not far removed from the attacks
on James Joyce's Ulysses as obscene.  See United States v. One Book Entitled
Ulysses, 72 F.2d 705 (2d Cir. 1934); see also Book Named &quot;John Cleland's
Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure&quot; v. Attorney General of Mass., 383 U.S. 413
(1966).  Even if we were to place confidence in the reasonable judgment of the
representatives of the Department of Justice who appeared before us, the
Department is not a monolithic structure, and individual U.S. Attorneys in the
various districts of the country have or appear to exercise some independence,
as reflected by the Department's tolerance of duplicative challenges in this
very case.</P>
<P>But the bottom line is that the First Amendment should not be interpreted to
require us to entrust the protection it affords to the judgment of prosecutors. 
Prosecutors come and go. Even federal judges are limited to life tenure.  The
First Amendment remains to give protection to future generations as well.  I
have no hesitancy in concluding that it is likely that plaintiffs will prevail
on the merits of their argument that the challenged provisions of the CDA are
facially invalid under both the First and Fifth Amendments.  </P>
<HR>
<P>BUCKWALTER, District Judge</P>
<H1>A.</H1>
<P>I believe that plaintiffs should prevail in this litigation.  </P>
<P>My conclusion differs in part from my original memorandum filed in
conjunction with the request for a Temporary Restraining Order.  As part of the
expedited review (per &#167; 561 of the CDA), and in contrast to the limited
documentation available to me at the time of the T.R.O. hearing, we have now

gathered voluminous evidence presented by way of sworn declarations, live
testimony, demonstrative evidence, and other exhibits.(1)  Based upon our
findings of fact derived from careful consideration of that evidence, I now
conclude that this statute is overbroad and does not meet the strict scrutiny
standard in Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115
(1989).</P>
<P>More specifically, I now find that current technology is inadequate to
provide a safe harbor to most speakers on the Internet.  On this issue, I concur
in Chief Judge Sloviter's opinion.  In addition, I continue to believe that the
word &quot;indecent&quot; is unconstitutionally vague, and I find that the terms
&quot;in context&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot; also are so vague as
to violate the First and Fifth Amendments.</P>
<P>It is, of course, correct that statutes that attempt to regulate the content
of speech presumptively violate the First Amendment.  <I>See e.g.</I> R.A.V. v.
City of Saint Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 381 (1992).  That is as it should be.  The
prohibition against Government's regulation of speech cannot be set forth any
clearer than in the language of the First Amendment itself.  I suspect, however,
that it may come as a surprise to many people who have not followed the
evolution of constitutional law that, by implication at least, the First
Amendment provides that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of
speech <I>unless that law advances a compelling governmental interest</I>.(2) 
Our cherished freedom of speech does not cover as broad a spectrum as one may
have gleaned from a simple reading of the Amendment.(3)  </P>
<P>First Amendment jurisprudence has developed into a study of intertwining
standards and applications, perhaps as a necessary response to our ever-evolving
culture and modes of communication.(4)  </P>
<P>Essentially, my concerns are these:  above all, I believe that the
challenged provisions are so vague as to violate both the First and Fifth
Amendments, and in particular that Congress' reliance on Pacifica is misplaced. 
In addition, I believe that technology as it currently exists -- and it bears
repeating that we are at the preliminary injunction phase only -- cannot provide
a safe harbor for most speakers on the Internet, thus rendering the statute
unconstitutional under a strict scrutiny analysis.  I refer to Chief Judge
Sloviter's more detailed analysis of this issue. </P>
<P>While I believe that our findings of fact clearly show that as yet no
defense is technologically feasible, and while I also have found the present Act
to be unconstitutionally vague, I believe it is too early in the development of
this new medium to conclude that other attempts to regulate protected speech
within the medium will fail a challenge.  That is to say that I specifically do
not find that any and all statutory regulation of protected speech on the
Internet could not survive constitutional scrutiny.  Prior cases have
established that government regulation to prevent access by minors to speech
protected for adults, even in media considered the vanguard of our First
Amendment protections, like print, may withstand a constitutional challenge.
<I> See e.g.</I> Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 635 (1968) (&quot;`Material
which is protected for distribution to adults is not necessarily
constitutionally protected from restriction upon its dissemination to children.'&quot;)
(quoting Bookcase Inc. v. Broderick, 18 N.Y.2d 71, 75, 271 N.Y.S.2d 947, 952,
218 N.E.2d 668, 671 (1966), <I>appeal dismissed, sub nom</I> Bookcase, Inc. v.
Leary, 385 U.S. 12 (1966)).  It should be noted that those restrictions that
have been found constitutional were sensitive to the unique qualities of the
medium at which the restriction was aimed.  </P>
<H1>B.</H1>
<P>This statute, all parties agree, deals with protected speech, the
preservation of which has been extolled by court after court in case after case
as the keystone, the bulwark, the very heart of our democracy. What is more, the
CDA attempts to regulate protected speech through criminal sanctions, thus
implicating not only the First but also the Fifth Amendment of our Constitution.
 The concept of due process is every bit as important to our form of government
as is free speech.  If free speech is at the heart of our democracy, then surely
due process is the very lifeblood of our body politic; for without it, democracy
could not survive.  Distilled to its essence, due process is, of course, nothing
more and nothing less than fair play.  If our citizens cannot rely on fair play
in their relationship with their government, the stature of our government as a
shining example of democracy would be greatly diminished.  I believe that an
exacting or strict scrutiny of a statute which attempts to criminalize protected
speech requires a word by word look at that statute to be sure that it clearly
sets forth as precisely as possible what constitutes a violation of the statute.</P>

<P>The reason for such an examination is obvious.  If the Government is going
to intrude upon the sacred ground of the First Amendment and tell its citizens
that their exercise of protected speech could land them in jail, the law
imposing such a penalty must clearly define the prohibited speech not only for
the potential offender but also for the potential enforcer.  Kolender, 461 U.S.
352; Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. 489; Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566 (1974);
Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104 (1972); Winters v. New York, 333 U.S.
507 (1948).</P>
<P>In dealing with issues of vagueness and due process over the years, the
Supreme Court has enunciated many notable principles.  One concern with vague
laws relates to the issue of notice.  The older cases have used phrases such as
&quot;a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so
vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and
differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law,&quot;
 Connally v. General Const. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926) (citations omitted); &quot;it
will not do to hold an average man to the peril of indictment for the unwise
exercise of his . . . knowledge involving so many factors of varying effect that
neither the person to decide in advance nor the jury to try him after the fact
can safely and certainly judge the result,&quot; Cline v. Frink Dairy Co., 274
U.S. 445, 465 (1927); and &quot;[n]o one may be required at peril of life,
liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.  All are
entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids,&quot; Lanzetta
v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939).  Second, the Court has said that laws
must provide precise standards for those who apply them to prevent arbitrary and
discriminatory enforcement, because &quot;[w]hen the legislature fails to
provide such minimal guidelines, a criminal statute may permit `a standardless
sweep [that] allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal
predilections.'&quot;  Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358 (citing Goguen, 415 U.S. at
575).  Finally, when First Amendment concerns have been implicated, a stricter
standard of examination for vagueness is imperative.  &quot;[T]his court has
intimated that stricter standards of permissible statutory vagueness may be
applied to a statute having a potentially inhibiting effect on speech; a man may
the less be required to act at his peril here, because the free dissemination of
ideas may be the loser.&quot;  Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 151 (1959). 
<I>See also</I> Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. at 499 (&quot;[P]erhaps the most
important factor affecting the clarity that the Constitution demands of a law is
whether it threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected
rights.  If, for example, the law interferes with the right of free speech . . .
, a more stringent vagueness test should apply.&quot;) (citations omitted).</P>
<P>A case which sums up vagueness as it relates to due process as succinctly as
any other is Grayned v. City of Rockford.  Here the court said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for
vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.  Vague laws offend
several important values.  First, because we assume that man is free to steer

between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of
ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so
that he may act accordingly.  Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing
fair warning.  Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be
prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them.  A
vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and
juries for resolution on an <I>ad hoc</I> and subjective basis, with the
attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.  Third, but
related, where a vague statute &quot;abut[s] upon sensitive areas of basic First
Amendment freedoms,&quot; it &quot;operates to inhibit the exercise of [those]
freedoms.&quot;  Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to &quot;'steer far
wider of the unlawful zone' . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas
were clearly marked.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-109 (citations omitted).  </P>
<P>At the same time, in considering the vagueness issue, as the Government
correctly points out, &quot;[C]ondemned to the use of words, we can never expect
mathematical certainty from our language.&quot; Grayned, 408 U.S. at 110.  <I>See
also </I>Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. 489; Hynes v. Mayor &amp; Council of Oradell,
425 U.S. 610 (1976); Goguen, 415 U.S. 566.   In addition, it will always be true
that the fertile legal &quot;imagination can conjure hypothetical cases in which
the meaning of [disputed] terms will be in nice question.&quot;  American
Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 412 (1950).  Thus, as I considered
the vagueness issue I have kept in mind the observation of Justice Holmes,
denying a challenge to vagueness in Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373 (1913). 
To Justice Holmes, &quot;the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends
on his estimating rightly, that is, as the jury subsequently estimates it, some
matter of degree.  If his judgment is wrong, not only may he incur a fine or a
short imprisonment . . ., he may incur the penalty of death.&quot;  Nash, 229
U.S. at 377.  Even more recently the court has stated that &quot;due process
does not require `impossible standards' of clarity.&quot;  Kolender, 461 U.S. at
361, (quoting United States v. Petrillo, 332 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1947)).  It is with
all of these principles in mind, as they interplay with the unique features of
the Internet, that I have reached my conclusion.</P>
<P>The fundamental constitutional principle that concerns me is one of simple
fairness, and that is absent in the CDA.  The Government initially argues that &quot;indecent&quot;
in this statute is the same as &quot;patently offensive.&quot;  I do not agree
that a facial reading of this statute supports that conclusion.  The CDA does
not define the term &quot;indecent,&quot; and the FCC has not promulgated
regulations defining indecency in the medium of cyberspace.   If &quot;indecent&quot;
and &quot;patently offensive&quot; were intended to have the same meaning,
surely section (a) could have mirrored section (d)'s language.(5)  Indecent in
this statute is an undefined word which, standing alone, offers no guidelines
whatsoever as to its parameters.  Interestingly, another federal crime gives a
definition to indecent entirely different from that proposed in the present
case.(6)  While not applicable here, this example shows the indeterminate nature
of the word and the need for clear definition, particularly in a statute which
infringes upon protected speech.  Although the use of different terms in &#167;
223(a) and (d) suggests that Congress intended that the terms have different
meanings, the Conference Report indicates an intention to treat &#167; 223(a) as
containing the same language as &#167; 223(d).  Conf. Rep. at 188-89 (&quot;The
conferees intend that the term indecency . . . has the same meaning as
established in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) and [Sable] and &quot;New
section 223(d)(1) codifies the definition of indecency from [Pacifica] . . . . 
The precise contours of the definition of indecency have varied . . . .  The
essence of the phrase -- patently offensive descriptions of sexual and excretory
activities -- has remained constant, however.&quot;).  Therefore, I will
acknowledge that the term indecency is &quot;reasonably susceptible&quot; to the
definition offered in the Conference Report and might therefore adopt such a
narrowing construction if it would thereby preserve the constitutionality of the
statute.  <I>See</I> Virginia v. American Booksellers Association, 484 U.S.
383, 397 (1988);  Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205 (1975).  
Accepting these terms as synonymous, however, provides no greater help to a
speaker attempting to comply with the CDA.  Contrary to the Government's
suggestion, Pacifica does not answer the question of whether the terms pass
constitutional muster in the present case.  In Pacifica, the Court did not
consider a vagueness challenge to the term &quot;indecent,&quot; but considered
only whether the Government had the authority to regulate the particular
broadcast at issue -- George Carlin's Monologue entitled &quot;Filthy Words.&quot;
 In finding in the affirmative, the Court emphasized that its narrow holding
applied only to broadcasting, which is &quot;uniquely accessible to children,
even those too young to read.&quot;  438 U.S. at 749.  Thus, while the Court
sanctioned the FCC's time restrictions on a radio program that repeatedly used

vulgar language, the Supreme Court did not hold that use of the term &quot;indecent&quot;
in a statute applied to other media, particularly a criminal statute, would be
on safe constitutional ground.</P>
<P>The Supreme Court more recently had occasion to consider a statute banning &quot;indecent&quot;
material in the dial-a-porn context in Sable, 492 U.S. 115, and found that a
complete ban on such programming violated the First Amendment because it was not
narrowly tailored to serve the purpose of limiting children's access to
commercial pornographic telephone messages.  Once again, the Court did not
consider a challenge to the term &quot;indecent&quot; on vagueness grounds, and
indeed has never directly ruled on this issue.</P>
<P>Several other courts have, however, upheld the use of the term in statutes
regulating different media.  For example, in Information Providers' Coalition v.
FCC, 928 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1991), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals considered
whether the term &quot;indecent&quot; in the 1989 Amendment to the
Communications Act regulating access to telephone dial-a-porn services and the
FCC's implementing regulations was void for vagueness.  The FCC had defined &quot;indecent&quot;
as &quot;the description or depiction of sexual or excretory activities or
organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community
standards for the telephone medium.&quot;  928 F.2d at 874.  Although
recognizing that the Supreme Court had never explicitly ruled on a vagueness
challenge to the term, the court read Sable and Pacifica as having implicitly
accepted the use of this definition of &quot;indecent.&quot;  The court further
stated that the FCC's definition of &quot;indecent&quot; was no less imprecise
than was the definition of &quot;obscenity&quot; as announced in Miller v.
California, 413 U.S. 15, 25 (1973), and thus concluded that &quot;indecent&quot;
as pertained to dial-a-porn regulations must survive a vagueness challenge. 
<I>See also</I> Dial Information Services v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir.
1991), (upholding the use of &quot;indecent&quot; in the same amendment to the
Communications Act and FCC regulations.); Action for Children's Television v.
FCC, 932 F.2d 1504, 1508 (D.C.Cir. 1991) (rejecting vagueness challenge to &quot;indecency&quot;
provision in broadcast television regulations).(7)</P>
<P>Notably, however, in these telephone and cable television cases the FCC had
defined indecent as patently offensive by reference to contemporary community
standards for that particular medium.  <I>See, e.g.</I>, Pacifica, 438 U.S. at
732 (defining &quot;indecent&quot; by reference to terms &quot;patently
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast
medium&quot;); Dial Information Services, 938 F.2d at 1540 (defining indecency
by reference to contemporary community standards for the telephone medium). 
Here, the provision is not so limited.  In fact, there is no effort to conform
the restricting terms to the medium of cyberspace, as is required under Pacifica
and its progeny.</P>
<P>The Government attempts to save the &quot;indecency&quot; and &quot;patently
offensive&quot; provisions by claiming that the provisions would only be used to
prosecute pornographic works which, when considered &quot;in context&quot; as
the statute requires, would be considered &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently
offensive&quot; in any community.  The Government thus contends that plaintiffs'
fears of prosecution for publishing material about matters of health, art,
literature or civil liberties are exaggerated and unjustified.  The Government's
argument raises two issues:  first is the question of which &quot;community
standards&quot; apply in cyberspace, under the CDA; and second is the
proposition that citizens should simply rely upon prosecutors to apply the
statute constitutionally.</P>
<P>Are the contemporary community standards to be applied those of the vast
world of cyberspace, in accordance with the Act's apparent intent to establish a
uniform national standard of content regulation?  The Government offered no
evidence of any such national standard or nationwide consensus as to what would
be considered &quot;patently offensive&quot;.  On the contrary, in supporting
the use of the term &quot;indecent&quot; in the CDA, the Government suggests
that, in part, this term was chosen as a means of insulating children from

material not restricted under current obscenity laws.  This additional term is
necessary, the Government states, because &quot;whether something rises to the
level of obscene is a legal conclusion that, by definition, may vary from
community to community.&quot;  Govt. Brief at 31.  In support of its argument,
the Government points to the Second Circuit's decision in United States v.
Various Articles of Obscene Merchandise, Schedule No. 2102, 709 F.2d 132, 134,
137 (2d Cir. 1983), which upheld the district court's conclusion that &quot;detailed
portrayals of genitalia, sexual intercourse, fellatio, and masturbation&quot;
including the film &quot;Deep Throat&quot; and other pornographic films and
magazines, are not obscene in light of the community standards prevailing in New
York City.&quot;  What this argument indicates is that as interpretations of
obscenity ebb and flow throughout various communities, restrictions on indecent
material are meant to cover a greater or lesser quantity of material not reached
by each community's obscenity standard.  It follows that to do this, what
constitutes indecency must be as open to fluctuation as the obscenity standard
and cannot be rigidly constructed as a single national standard if it is meant
to function as the Government has suggested.  As Justice Scalia stated, &quot;[t]he
more narrow the understanding of what is `obscene,' . . . the more pornographic
what is embraced within the residual category of `indecency.'&quot;  Sable, 492
U.S. at 132 (Scalia, J. concurring).  This understanding is consistent with the
case law, in which the Supreme Court has explained that the relevant community
is the one where the information is accessed and where the local jury sits. 
<I>See</I> Sable, 492 U.S. at 125; Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87
(1974); Miller, 413 U.S. at 30 (&quot;[O]ur nation is simply too big and too
diverse for this Court to reasonably expect that such standards [of what is
patently offensive] could be articulated for all 50 states in a single
formulation.&quot;).  However, the Conference Report with regard to the CDA
states that the Act is &quot;intended to establish a uniform national standard
of content regulation.&quot;  Conf. Rep. at 191.  This conflict inevitably
leaves the reader of the CDA unable to discern the relevant &quot;community
standard,&quot; and will undoubtedly cause Internet users to &quot;steer far
wider of the unlawful zone&quot; than if the community standard to be applied
were clearly defined.  The chilling effect on the Internet users' exercise of
free speech is obvious.  <I>See</I> Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 372
(1964).  This is precisely the vice of vagueness.</P>
<P>In addition, the Government's argument that the challenged provisions will
be applied only to &quot;pornographic&quot; materials, and will not be applied
to works with serious value is without support in the CDA itself.  Unlike in the
obscenity context, indecency has not been defined to exclude works of serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific value, and therefore the
Government's suggestion that it will not be used to prosecute publishers of such
material is without foundation in the law itself.  The Government's claim that
the work must be considered patently offensive &quot;in context&quot; does

nothing to clarify the provision, for it fails to explain which context is
relevant.  &quot;Context&quot; may refer to, among other things, the nature of
the communication as a whole, the time of day it was conveyed, the medium used,
the identity of the speaker, or whether or not it is accompanied by appropriate
warnings.  <I>See e.g.</I>, Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 741 n.16, n.17 (referring to &quot;the
context of the whole book,&quot; and to the unique interpretation of the First
Amendment &quot;in the broadcasting context&quot;).</P>
<P>The thrust of the Government's argument is that the court should trust
prosecutors to prosecute only a small segment of those speakers subject to the
CDA's restrictions, and whose works would reasonably be considered &quot;patently
offensive&quot; in every community.  Such unfettered discretion to prosecutors,
however, is precisely what due process does not allow.  &quot;It will not do to
say that a prosecutor's sense of fairness and the Constitution would prevent a
successful . . . prosecution for some of the activities seemingly embraced
within the sweeping statutory definitions.  The hazard of being prosecuted . . .
nevertheless remains . . . .  Well-intentioned prosecutors and judicial
safeguards do not neutralize the vice of a vague law.&quot;  Baggett, 377 U.S.
at 373-74; <I>see also</I> Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 599
(1967)(&quot;[i]t is no answer&quot; to a vague law for the Government &quot;to
say that the statute would not be applied in such a case.&quot;).  And we cannot
overlook the vagaries of politics.  What may be, figuratively speaking, one
administration's pen may be another's sword.</P>
<P>The evidence and arguments presented by the Government illustrate the
possibility of arbitrary enforcement of the Act.  For example, one Government
expert opined that any of the so-called &quot;seven dirty words&quot; used in
the Carlin monologue would be subject to the CDA and therefore should be &quot;tagged,&quot;
as should paintings of nudes displayed on a museum's web site.  The Government
has suggested in its brief, however, that the Act should not be so applied. 
<I>See</I> Govt. Brief at 37 (suggesting that &quot;seven dirty words&quot; if
used &quot;in the context of serious discussions&quot;<B> </B>would not be
subject to the Act).  Even Government counsel was unable to define &quot;indecency&quot;
with specificity.  The Justice Department attorney could not respond to numerous
questions from the court regarding whether, for example, artistic photographs of
a nude man with an erect penis, depictions of Indian statues portraying
different methods of copulation, or the transcript of a scene from a
contemporary play about AIDS could be considered &quot;indecent&quot; under the
Act.  </P>
<P>Plaintiffs also argue that section 223(e)(5)(A) of the CDA, offering a
defense for speakers who take &quot;good faith, reasonable, effective and
appropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by
minors to a communication&quot; covered by the Act, is unconstitutionally vague
because it fails to specify what would constitute an effective defense to
prosecution.  The plain language of the safe harbor provision indicates an
effort to ensure that the statute limits speech in the least restrictive means
possible by taking into account emerging technologies in allowing for any and
all &quot;reasonable, effective and appropriate&quot; approaches to restricting
minors' access to the proscribed material.  But, the statute itself does not
contain any description of what, other than credit card verification and adult
identification codes -- which we have established remain unavailable to most
content providers -- will protect a speaker from prosecution.  Significantly,
although the FCC is authorized to specify measures that might satisfy this
defense, the FCC's views will not be definitive but will only &quot;be admitted
as evidence of good faith efforts&quot; that the defendant has met the
requirements of the defense.  47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(e)(6).  Thus, individuals
attempting to comply with the statute presently have no clear indication of what
actions will ensure that they will be insulated from criminal sanctions under
the CDA.           </P>
<H1>C.</H1>
<P>The consequences of posting indecent content are severe.(8)  I recognize
that people must make judgments each and every day, many times in the most
intimate of relationships and that an error in judgment can have serious
consequences.  It is also true that where those consequences involve penal
sanctions, a criminal law or statute has more often than not carefully defined
the proscribed conduct.  It is not so much that the accused needs these precise
definitions, as it has been said he or she rarely reads the law in advance. 
What is more important is that the enforcer of statutes must be guided by clear
and precise standards.  In statutes that break into relatively new areas, such
as this one, the need for definition of terms is greater, because even commonly
understood terms may have different connotations or parameters in this new
context.(9)   Words cannot define conduct with mathematical certainty, and
lawyers, like the bright and intelligent ones now before us, will most certainly
continue to devise ways by which to challenge them.  This rationale, however,
can neither support a finding of constitutionality nor relieve legislators from
the very difficult task of carefully drafting legislation tailored to its goal
and sensitive to the unique characteristics of, in this instance, cyberspace.</P>
<HR>
<P>DALZELL, District Judge</P>
<H1>A. Introduction</H1>
<P>I begin with first principles:  As a general rule, the Constitution forbids
the Government from silencing speakers because of their particular message. 
R.A.V. v. City of Saint Paul, 112 S. Ct. 2538, 2542 (1992).  &quot;Our political
system and cultural life rest upon this ideal.&quot;  Turner Broadcasting Sys.
v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2458 (1994).  This general rule is subject only to &quot;narrow
and well-understood exceptions&quot;.  Id.  A law that, as here, regulates
speech on the basis of its content, is &quot;presumptively invalid&quot;. 
R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2542.</P>
<P>Two of the exceptions to this general rule deal with obscenity (commonly
understood to include so-called hardcore pornography), Miller v. California, 413
U.S. 15 (1973), and child pornography, New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982). 
The Government can and does punish with criminal sanction people who engage in
these forms of speech.  18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1464-65 (criminalizing obscene
material); id. &#167;&#167; 2251-52 (criminalizing child pornography).  Indeed,
the Government could punish these forms of speech on the Internet even without
the CDA.  E.g., United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701, 704-05 (6th Cir. 1995)
(affirming obscenity convictions for the operation of a computer bulletin
board).  </P>
<P>The Government could also completely ban obscenity and child pornography
from the Internet.  No Internet speaker has a right to engage in these forms of
speech, and no Internet listener has a right to receive them.  Child pornography
and obscenity have &quot;no constitutional protection, and the government may
ban [them] outright in certain media, or in all.&quot;  Alliance for Community
Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105, 112 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citing R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at
2545), cert. granted sub nom. Denver Area Educ. Telecommunications Consortium,
116 S. Ct. 471 (1996); see also Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756.  As R.A.V. notes, &quot;'the
freedom of speech' referred to by the First Amendment does not include a freedom
to disregard these traditional limitations.&quot;  R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2543.</P>
<P>The cases before us, however, are not about obscenity or child pornography. 
Plaintiffs in these actions claim no right to engage in these forms of speech in
the future, nor does the Government intimate that plaintiffs have engaged in
these forms of speech in the past.</P>
<P>This case is about &quot;indecency&quot;, as that word has come to be
understood since the Supreme Court's decisions in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,
438 U.S. 726 (1976), and Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).  The
legal difficulties in these actions arise because of the special place that
indecency occupies in the Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence.  While
adults have a First Amendment right to engage in indecent speech, Sable, 492
U.S. at 126; see also Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 747-48, the Supreme Court has also
held that the Government may, consistent with the Constitution, regulate
indecency on radio and television, and in the &quot;dial-a-porn&quot; context,
as long as the regulation does not operate as a complete ban.  Thus, any
regulation of indecency in these areas must give adults access to indecent
speech, which is their right.</P>
<P>The Government may only regulate indecent speech for a compelling reason,
and in the least restrictive manner.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 126.  &quot;It is not
enough to show that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be
carefully tailored to achieve those ends.&quot;  Id.  This &quot;most exacting
scrutiny&quot;, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2459, requires the Government to &quot;demonstrate
that the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation
will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.&quot;  United
States v. National Treasury Employees Union, 115 S. Ct. 1003, 1017 (1995)
(citing Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 1017).  Thus, although our analysis here must
balance ends and means, the scales tip at the outset in plaintiffs' favor.  This
is so because &quot;[r]egulations which permit the Government to discriminate on
the basis of the content of the message cannot be tolerated under the First
Amendment.&quot;  Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New York State
Crime Victims Board, 502 U.S. 105, 116 (1991) (citation omitted).  </P>
<P>The Government argues that this case is really about pornography on the
Internet.  Apart from hardcore and child pornography, however, the word
pornography does not have a fixed legal meaning.  When I use the word
pornography in my analysis below, I refer to for-profit purveyors of sexually
explicit, &quot;adult&quot; material similar to that at issue in Sable.  See 492
U.S. at 118.  Pornography is normally either obscene or indecent, as Justice
Scalia noted in his concurrence in Sable.  Id. at 132.  I would avoid using such
an imprecise (and overbroad) word, but I feel compelled to do so here, since
Congress undoubtedly had such material in mind when it passed the CDA.  See S.
Rep. No. 230, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 187-91 (1996), reprinted in 1996
U.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 200-05 [hereinafter Senate Report].  Moreover, the Government
has defended the Act before this court by arguing that the Act could be
constitutionally applied to such material.</P>
<P>Plaintiffs have, as noted, moved for a preliminary injunction.  The
standards for such relief are well-settled.  Plaintiffs seeking preliminary
injunctive relief must show (1) &quot;[a] reasonable probability of eventual
success in the litigation&quot; and (2) &quot;irreparabl[e] injur[y] pendente
lite&quot; if relief is not granted.  Acierno v. New Castle County, 40 F.2d 645,
653 (3d Cir. 1994).  We must also consider, if appropriate, (3) &quot;the
possibility of harm to other interested persons from the grant or denial of the
injunction&quot;, and (4) &quot;the public interest&quot;.  Id.; see also
Opticians Ass'n v. Independent Opticians, 920 F.2d 187, 192 (3d Cir. 1990).</P>
<P>In a First Amendment challenge, a plaintiff who meets the first prong of the
test for a preliminary injunction will almost certainly meet the second, since
irreparable injury normally arises out of the deprivation of speech rights, &quot;for
even minimal periods of time&quot;.  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74
(1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 848
(1989).  Of course, neither the Government nor the public generally can claim an
interest in the enforcement of an unconstitutional law.  Thus, I focus my legal
analysis today primarily on whether plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of
success on their claim that the CDA is unconstitutional.  The issues of
irreparable harm to plaintiffs, harm to third parties, and the public interest
all flow from that determination.(1)</P>
<P>Plaintiffs' challenge here is a &quot;facial&quot; one.  A law that
regulates the content of speech is facially invalid if it does not pass the &quot;most
exacting scrutiny&quot; that we have described above, or if it would &quot;penalize
a substantial amount of speech that is constitutionally protected&quot;. 
Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 112 S. Ct. 2395, 2401 (1992).  This is
so even if some applications would be &quot;constitutionally unobjectionable&quot;.
 Id.; see also National Treasury Employees Union v. United States, 990 F.2d
1271, 1279-80 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (Randolph, J., concurring), aff'd, 115 S. Ct.
1003 (1995).  Sometimes facial challenges require an inquiry into a party's &quot;standing&quot;
(i.e., whether a party may properly challenge a law as facially invalid).  See,
e.g., Ferber, 458 U.S. at 767-79.  At other times a facial challenge requires
only an inquiry into the law's reach.  See, e.g., R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2547.(2)
 As I describe it in part C below, I have no question that plaintiffs here have
standing to challenge the validity of the CDA, and, indeed, the Government has
not seriously challenged plaintiffs' standing to do so.  See, e.g., Virginia v.
American Booksellers Assoc., 484 U.S. 383, 392 (1988).  Thus, the focus is
squarely on the merits of plaintiffs' facial challenge.(3)</P>
<P>I divide my legal analysis below into three parts.  In Part B, I examine the
traditional definition of indecency and relate it to the provisions of the CDA
at issue in this action.  From this analysis I conclude that &#167; 223(a) and &#167;
223(d) of the CDA reach the same kind of speech.  My analysis also convinces me
that plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed in their claim that the CDA is
unconstitutionally vague.  In Part C, I address the Government's argument that
plaintiffs are not the CDA's target, nor would they likely face prosecution
under the Act.  Here, I conclude that plaintiffs could reasonably fear
prosecution under the Act, even if some of their fears border on the farfetched.
 In Part D, I consider the legal implications of the special attributes of
Internet communication, as well as the effect that the CDA would have on these
attributes.  In this Part I conclude that the disruptive effect of the CDA on
Internet communication, as well as the CDA's broad reach into protected speech,
not only render the Act unconstitutional but also would render unconstitutional
any regulation of protected speech on this new medium.</P>
<H1>B.  Defining Indecency</H1>
<P>Although no court of appeals has ever to my knowledge upheld a vagueness
challenge to the meaning of &quot;indecency&quot;, several recent cases have
grappled with the elusive meaning of that word in the context of cable
television and &quot;dial-a-porn&quot;.  Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 56
F.3d 105 (D.C. Cir. 1995), cert. granted, 116 S. Ct. 471 (1996); Dial
Information Serv. Corp. v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991), cert.
denied, 502 U.S. 1072 (1992); Information Providers Coalition for Defense of the
First Amendment v. FCC, 928 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1991).</P>
<P>In Alliance for Community Media, 56 F.3d at 123-25, for example, the
District of Columbia Court of Appeals addressed prohibitions on indecent
programming on certain cable television channels.  That court noted that the FCC
has codified the meaning of &quot;'indecent' programming&quot; on cable
television as &quot;programming that describes or depicts sexual or excretory
activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary
community standards for the cable medium.&quot;  Id. at 112 (citing what is now
47 C.F.R. &#167; 76.701(g)).</P>
<P>The FCC took a similar approach to the definition of &quot;indecency&quot;
in the &quot;dial-a-porn&quot; medium.(4)  In Dial Information Services, 938
F.2d at 1540, the Second Circuit quoted the FCC's definition of indecent
telephone communications in that context:</P>
<P>[I]n the dial-a-porn context, we believe it is appropriate to define
indecency as the description or depiction of sexual or excretory activities or
organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community
standards for the telephone medium.</P>
<P>Id. at 1540 (citation omitted); see also Information Providers' Coalition
for Defense of the First Amendment v. FCC, 928 F.2d 866, 876 (9th Cir. 1991).</P>
<P>These three cases recognize that the FCC did not define &quot;indecency&quot;
for cable and dial-a-porn in a vacuum.  Rather, it borrowed from the Supreme
Court's decision in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).  In that
case (which I describe in greater detail below), the Supreme Court established
the rough outline from which the FCC fashioned its three-part definition.  For
the first two parts of the test, the Supreme Court emphasized the &quot;importance
of context&quot; in examining arguably indecent material.  Id. at 747 n.25.  &quot;Context&quot;
in the Pacifica opinion includes consideration of both the particular medium
from which the material originates and the particular community that receives
the material.  Id. at 746 (assuming that the Carlin monologue &quot;would be
protected in other contexts&quot;); id. at 748-51 (discussing the attributes of
broadcast); see also Information Providers' Coalition, 928 F.2d at 876
(discussing the &quot;content/context dichotomy&quot;).  Second, the opinion
limits its discussion to &quot;patently offensive sexual and excretory language&quot;,
Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 747, and this type of content has remained the FCC's
touchstone.  See, e.g., Alliance for Community Media, 56 F.3d at 112.(5)</P>
<P>We have quoted from the CDA extensively above and I will only briefly
rehearse that discussion here.  Section 223(a) of the CDA criminalizes &quot;indecent&quot;
speech on the Internet.  This is the &quot;indecency&quot; provision.  Section
223(d) of the CDA addresses speech that, &quot;in context, depicts or describes,
in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,
sexual or excretory activities or organs&quot;.  This is the &quot;patently
offensive&quot; provision.  The foregoing discussion leads me to conclude that
these two provisions describe the same kind of speech.  That is, the use of &quot;indecent&quot;
in &#167; 223(a) is shorthand for the longer description in &#167; 223(d). 
Conversely, the longer description in &#167; 223(d) is itself the definition of &quot;indecent&quot;
speech.  I believe Congress could have used the word &quot;indecent&quot; in
both &#167; 223(a) and &#167; 223(d), or it could have used the &quot;patently
offensive&quot; description of &#167; 223(d) in &#167; 223(a), without a change
in the meaning of the Act.  I do not believe that Congress intended that this
distinction alone would change the reach of either section of the CDA.(6)</P>
<P>The CDA's legislative history confirms this conclusion.  There, the
conference committee explicitly noted that &#167; 223(d) &quot;codifies the
definition of indecency from FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978). .
. .  The conferees intend that the term indecency (and the rendition of the
definition of that term in new section 502) has the same meaning as established
in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) and Sable Communications of
California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).&quot;  Senate Report at 188,
reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201-02.  The legislative history makes clear
that Congress did not intend to create a distinction in meaning when it used the
generic term &quot;indecency&quot; in &#167; 223(a) and the definition of that
term in &#167; 223(d).(7)</P>
<P>There is no doubt that the CDA requires the most stringent review for
vagueness, since it is a criminal statute that &quot;threatens to inhibit the
exercise of constitutionally protected rights&quot;.  Colautti v. Franklin, 439
U.S 379, 391 (1979); see also Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 n.8 (1983);
Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-09.  My analysis here nevertheless leads ineluctably to
the conclusion that the definition of indecency is not unconstitutionally vague.
 The Miller definition of obscenity has survived such challenges, see, e.g.,
Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 118-19 (1974); Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v.
Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 57 (1989), and the definition of indecency contains a
subset of the elements of obscenity.  If the Miller test &quot;give[s] the
person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is
prohibited, so that he may act accordingly&quot;, Grayned v. City of Rockford,
408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972), the omission of parts of that test does not warrant a
contrary conclusion.  See Dial Information Services, 938 F.2d at 1541-42. 
Similarly, since the definition of indecency arose from the Supreme Court itself
in Pacifica, we may fairly imply that the Court did not believe its own
interpretation to invite &quot;arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement&quot; or
&quot;abut upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms&quot;. 
Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-109 (citations and alterations omitted).  Sable, while
not explicitly addressing the issue of vagueness, reinforces this conclusion. 
See Information Providers' Coalition, 928 F.2d at 875-76 (citing Sable, 492 U.S.
at 126-27).  It follows, then, that plaintiffs' vagueness challenge is not
likely to succeed on the merits and does not support preliminary injunctive
relief.</P>
<P>The possible interpretations of the defenses in &#167; 223(e) do not alter
this conclusion.  As a matter of statutory construction, &#167; 223(e)(5)(B)
could not be clearer.  This section, which imports the dial-a-porn defenses into
the CDA, creates &quot;specific and objective&quot; methods to avoid liability. 
See Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 629 (1984).  Section
223(e)(5)(A) is more suspect, since it arguably &quot;fail[s] to describe with
sufficient particularity what a suspect must do in order to satisfy&quot; it. 
Kolender 461 U.S. at 361.(8)  Yet even though the defenses in both sections are
unavailable to many Internet users, their unavailability does not render the
liability provisions vague.  Rather, their unavailability just transforms &#167;
223(a) and &#167; 223(d) into a total ban, in violation of Butler v. Michigan,
352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957), and Sable, 492 U.S. at 127, 131.  I am sensitive to
plaintiffs' arguments that the statute, as written, does not create safe harbors
through which all Internet users may shield themselves from liability. 
Transcript of May 10, 1996, at 37-38.  Here again, however, the absence of safe
harbors relates to the (over)breadth of a statute, and not its vagueness.  See
Sable, 492 U.S. at 127, 131.</P>
<H1>C.  Plaintiffs' Likelihood of Prosecution Under the Act</H1>
<P>The Government has consistently argued that the speech of many of the
plaintiffs here is almost certainly not indecent.  They point, for example, to
the educational and political content of plaintiffs' speech, and they also
suggest that the occasional curse word in a card catalogue will probably not
result in prosecution.  See Senate Report at 189, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N.
at 203 (&quot;Material with serious redeeming value is quite obviously intended
to edify and educate, not to offend.&quot;).  In this section I address that
argument.</P>
<P>I agree with the Government that some of plaintiffs' claims are somewhat
exaggerated, but hyperbolic claims do not in themselves weigh in the
Government's favor.  In recent First Amendment challenges, the Supreme Court has
itself paid close attention to extreme applications of content-based laws.  </P>
<P>In Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New York State Crimes Victim
Board, 502 U.S. 105 (1991), the Court addressed the constitutionality of a law
that required criminals to turn over to their victims any income derived from
books, movies, or other commercial exploitation of their crimes.  Id. at 504-05.
 In its opinion, the Court evaluated the argument of an amicus curiae that the
law's reach could include books such as The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Civil
Disobedience, and Confessions of Saint Augustine, and authors such as Emma
Goldman, Martin Luther King, Jr., Sir Walter Raleigh, Jesse Jackson, and
Bertrand Russell.  Id. at 121-22.  The Court credited the argument even while
recognizing that it was laced with &quot;hyperbole&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The argument that [the] statute . . . would prevent publication of all of
these works is hyperbole -- some would have been written without compensation --
but the . . . law clearly reaches a wide range of literature that does not
enable a criminal to profit from his crime while a victim remains uncompensated.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 122.  If a content-based law &quot;can produce such an outcome&quot;,
id. at 123 (emphasis added), then Simon &amp; Schuster allows us to consider
those outcomes in our analysis.</P>
<P>Even more recently, in United States v. National Treasury Employees Union,
115 S. Ct. 1003 (1995), the Court addressed the constitutionality of a law that
banned federal employees from accepting honoraria for publications unrelated to
their work.  Id. at 1008.  The Court noted that the law would reach &quot;literary
giants like Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville, . . . Walt Whitman, . . .
and Bret Harte&quot;.  Id. at 1012.  This concern resurfaced later in the
opinion, see id. at 1015 (&quot;[W]e cannot ignore the risk that [the ban] might
deprive us of the work of a future Melville or Hawthorne.&quot;), even though a
footnote immediately renders this concern at least hyperbolic:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These authors' familiar masterworks would survive the honoraria ban as
currently administered.  Besides exempting all books, the [regulations
implementing the ban] protect fiction and poetry from the ban's coverage,
although the statute's language is not so clear.  But some great artists deal in
fact as well as fiction, and some deal in both.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. n.16 (citations omitted).</P>
<P>Here, even though it is perhaps unlikely that the Carnegie Library will ever
stand in the dock for putting its card catalogue online, or that the Government
will hale the ACLU into court for its online quiz of the seven dirty words, we
cannot ignore that the Act could reach these activities.  The definition of
indecency, like the definition of obscenity, is not a rigid formula.  Rather, it
confers a large degree of autonomy to individual communities to set the bounds
of decency for themselves.  Cf. Sable, 492 U.S. at 125-26.  This is as it should
be, since this flexibility recognizes that ours is a country with diverse
cultural and historical roots.  See, e.g., Hamling, 418 U.S. at 104 (&quot;A
juror is entitled to draw on his own knowledge of the views of the average
person in the community or vicinage from which he comes for making the required
determination, just as he is entitled to draw on his knowledge of the
propensities of a 'reasonable' person in other areas of the law.&quot;).</P>
<P>Putting aside hyperbolic application, I also have little doubt that some
communities could well consider plaintiffs' speech indecent, and these
plaintiffs could -- perhaps should -- have a legitimate fear of prosecution.  In
Action for Children's Television v. FCC, 58 F.3d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1995), the
District of Columbia Court of Appeals summarized three broadcasts that the FCC
found indecent in the late 1980s:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The offending morning broadcast . . . contained &quot;explicit references to
masturbation, ejaculation, breast size, penis size, sexual intercourse, nudity,
urination, oral-genital contact, erections, sodomy, bestiality, menstruation and
testicles.&quot;  The remaining two were similarly objectionable.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Id. at 657 (citing In re Infinity Broadcasting Corp., 3 FCC R. 930, 932
(1987)).  In Infinity Broadcasting, one of the broadcasts that the FCC found
indecent was an excerpt of a play about AIDS, finding that the excerpts &quot;contained
the concentrated and repeated use of vulgar and shocking language to portray
graphic and lewd depictions of excretion, anal intercourse, ejaculation,
masturbation, and oral-genital sex&quot;.  3 FCC R. at 934.(9)  To the FCC, even
broadcasts with &quot;public value . . . addressing the serious problems posed
by AIDS&quot; can be indecent if &quot;that material is presented in a manner
that is patently offensive&quot;.  Id. (emphasis in original).(10)  </P>
<P>Yet, this is precisely the kind of speech that occurs, for example, on
Critical Path AIDS Project's Web site, which includes safer sex instructions
written in street language for easy comprehension.  The Web site also describes
the risk of HIV transmission for particular sexual practices.  The FCC's
implication in In the Matter of King Broadcasting Co., 5 FCC R. 2971 (1990),
that a &quot;candid discussion[] of sexual topics&quot; on television was decent
in part because it was &quot;not presented in a pandering, titillating or vulgar
manner&quot; would be unavailing to Critical Path, other plaintiffs, and some
amici.  These organizations want to pander and titillate on their Web sites, at
least to a degree, to attract a teen audience and deliver their message in an
engaging and coherent way.(11)</P>
<P>In In re letter to Merrell Hansen, 6 FCC R. 3689 (1990), the FCC found
indecent a morning discussion between two announcers regarding Jim Bakker's
alleged rape of Jessica Hahn.  Id.  Here, too, the FCC recognized that the
broadcast had public value.  Id. (noting that the broadcast concerned &quot;an
incident that was at the time 'in the news'&quot;).  Yet, under the FCC's
interpretation of Pacifica, &quot;the merit of a work is 'simply one of the many
variables' that make up a work's context&quot;.  Id. (citation omitted).</P>
<P>One of the plaintiffs here, Stop Prisoner Rape, Inc., has as its core
purpose the issue of prison rape.  The organization creates chat rooms in which
members can discuss their experiences.  Some amici have also organized Web sites
dedicated to survivors of rape, incest, and other sexual abuse.  These Web sites
provide fora for the discussion and contemplation of shared experiences.  The
operators of these sites, and their participants, could legitimately fear
prosecution under the CDA.</P>
<P>With respect to vulgarity, the Government is in a similarly weak position. 
In Pacifica, the Supreme Court held that multiple repetition of expletives could
be indecent.  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 750.  Although the FCC did not follow this
rationale with respect to a broadcast of &quot;a bona fide news story&quot; on
National Public Radio, Letter to Mr. Peter Branton, 6 FCC R. 610 (1991), aff'd
on other grounds sub nom. Branton v. FCC, 993 F.2d 906, 908 (D.C. Cir. 1993),
the ACLU, a plaintiff here, could take little comfort from that administrative
decision.  It would need to discern, for example, whether a chat room that it
organized to discuss the meaning of the word fuck was more like the Carlin
monologue or more like a National Public Radio broadcast.(12)  Plaintiffs'
expert would have found expletives indecent in a community consisting only of
himself,(13) and his views undoubtedly -- and reasonably -- reflect the view of
many people.  </P>
<P>In sum, I am less confident than the Government that societal mores have
changed so drastically since Pacifica that an online equivalent of the Carlin
monologue, or the Carlin monologue itself online, would pass muster under the
CDA.  Under existing precedent, plaintiffs' fear of prosecution under the Act is
legitimate, even though they are not the pornographers Congress had in mind when
it passed the CDA.(14)   Cf. City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 459 (1987). 
My discussion of the effect and reach of the CDA, therefore, applies both to
plaintiffs' hyperbolic concerns and to their very real ones.</P>
<H1>D.  A Medium-Specific Analysis</H1>
<P>The Internet is a new medium of mass communication.(15)  As such, the
Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence compels us to consider the special
qualities of this new medium in determining whether the CDA is a constitutional
exercise of governmental power.  Relying on these special qualities, which we
have described at length in our Findings of fact above, I conclude that the CDA
is unconstitutional and that the First Amendment denies Congress the power to
regulate protected speech on the Internet.  This analysis and conclusions are
consistent with Congress's intent to avoid tortuous and piecemeal review of the
CDA by authorizing expedited, direct review in the Supreme Court &quot;as a
matter of right&quot; of interlocutory, and not merely final, orders upholding
facial challenges to the Act.  See &#167; 561(b) of the Telecommunications Act
of 1996.(16)</P>
<H1>1.  The Differential Treatment of Mass Communication Media</H1>
<P>Nearly fifty years ago, Justice Jackson recognized that &quot;[t]he moving
picture screen, the radio, the newspaper, the handbill, the sound truck and the
street corner orator have differing natures, values, abuses and dangers.  Each .
. . is a law unto itself&quot;.  Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 97 (1949)
(Jackson, J., concurring).  The Supreme Court has expressed this sentiment time
and again since that date, and differential treatment of the mass media has
become established First Amendment doctrine.  See, e.g., Turner Broadcasting
Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2456 (1994) (&quot;It is true that our cases
have permitted more intrusive regulation of broadcast speakers than of speakers
in other media.&quot;); Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748 (&quot;We have long recognized
that each medium of expression presents special First Amendment problems.&quot;);
City of Los Angeles v. Preferred Communications, Inc., 476 U.S. 488, 496 (1974)
(&quot;Different communications media are treated differently for First
Amendment purposes.&quot;) (Blackmun, J., concurring); Metromedia, Inc. v. City
of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 500-01 (1981) (plurality opinion) (&quot;This Court
has often faced the problem of applying the broad principles of the First
Amendment to unique forums of expression.&quot;).  Thus, the Supreme Court has
established different rules for print, Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo,
418 U.S. 241 (1974), broadcast radio and television, see, e.g., Red Lion
Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), cable television, Turner, 114 S.
Ct. at 2456-57, and even billboards, Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 501, and drive-in
movie theaters, Erzoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205 (1975).</P>
<P>This medium-specific approach to mass communication examines the underlying
technology of the communication to find the proper fit between First Amendment
values and competing interests.  In print media, for example, the proper fit
generally forbids governmental regulation of content, however minimal. 
Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 258.  In other media (billboards, for example), the proper
fit may allow for some regulation of both content and of the underlying
technology (such as it is) of the communication.  Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 502.</P>
<P>Radio and television broadcasting present the most expansive approach to
medium-specific regulation of mass communication.  As a result of the scarcity
of band widths on the electromagnetic spectrum, the Government holds broad
authority both to parcel out the frequencies and to prohibit others from
speaking on the same frequency:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As a general matter, there are more would-be broadcasters than frequencies
available in the electromagnetic spectrum.  And if two broadcasters were to
attempt to transmit over the same frequency in the same locale, they would
interfere with one another's signals, so that neither could be heard at all. 
The scarcity of broadcast frequencies thus required the establishment of some
regulatory mechanism to divide the electromagnetic spectrum and assign specific
frequencies to particular broadcasters.  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456 (citing FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S.
364 (1984)).</P>
<P>This scarcity also allows the Government to regulate content even after it
assigns a license:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, the inherent physical limitation on the number of speakers who
may use the broadcast medium has been thought to require some adjustment in
traditional First Amendment analysis to permit the Government to place limited
content restraints, and impose certain affirmative obligations, on broadcast
licensees.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 2457 (citing Red Lion, 395 U.S. at 390-95; National Broadcasting Co.
v. United States, 319 U.S. 190 (1943)).  </P>
<P>The broadcasting cases firmly establish that the Government may force a
licensee to offer content to the public that the licensee would otherwise not
offer, thereby assuring that radio and television audiences have a diversity of
content.  In broadcasting, &quot;[i]t is the right of the public to receive
suitable access to social, political, esthetic, moral, and other ideas and
experiences which is crucial&quot;.  Red Lion, 395 U.S. at 390; see also CBS,
Inc. v. FCC, 453 U.S. 367, 395 (1981) (&quot;A licensed broadcaster is 'granted
the free and exclusive use of a limited and valuable part of the public domain;
when he accepts that franchise it is burdened by enforceable public
obligations.'&quot;) (citation omitted); Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v.
Democratic Nat'l Comm., 412 U.S. 94, 110-11 (1973).  These content restrictions
include punishing licensees who broadcast inappropriate but protected speech at
an impermissible time.  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 750-51.</P>
<P>In this case, the Government relies on the Pacifica decision in arguing that
the CDA is a constitutional exercise of governmental power.  Since the CDA
regulates indecent speech, and since Pacifica authorizes governmental regulation
of indecent speech (so the Government's argument goes), it must follow that the
CDA is a valid exercise of governmental power.  That argument, however, ignores
Pacifica's roots as a decision addressing the proper fit between broadcasting
and the First Amendment.  The argument also assumes that what is good for
broadcasting is good for the Internet.</P>
<H1> 2.  The Scope of the Pacifica Decision</H1>
<P>In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), the Supreme Court first
decided whether the Government had the power to regulate indecent speech.  Id.
at 729.  In Pacifica, a radio listener complained about the broadcast of George
Carlin's &quot;Filthy Words&quot; monologue at 2:00 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon.
 Id. at 729-30.  The Carlin monologue was replete with &quot;the words you
couldn't say on the public . . . airwaves . . . , ever&quot;, and the listener
had tuned in while driving with his young son in New York.  Id.  The FCC issued
a declaratory order, holding that it could have subjected the Pacifica
Foundation (owner of the radio station) to an administrative sanction.  Id. at
730.  In its order the FCC also described the standards that it would use in the
future to regulate indecency in the broadcast medium.  Id. at 731.  The Supreme
Court upheld the FCC's decision and confirmed the power of that agency to
regulate indecent speech.  Id. at 750-51.</P>
<P>The rationale of Pacifica rested on three overlapping considerations. 
First, using as its example the Carlin monologue before it, the Court weighed
the value of indecent speech and concluded that such speech &quot;lie[s] at the
periphery of First Amendment concerns.&quot;  Id. at 743.  Although the Court
recognized that the FCC had threatened to punish Pacifica based on the content
of the Carlin monologue, id. at 742, it found that the punishment would have
been permissible because four-letter words &quot;offend for the same reasons
that obscenity offends.&quot;  Id. at 746 (footnote omitted).  The Court then
described the place of four-letter words &quot;in the hierarchy of first
amendment values&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of
such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived
from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 746 (citing Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942)). 
</P>
<P>Second, the Court recognized that &quot;broadcasting . . . has received the
most limited First Amendment protection.&quot;  Id. at 748.  The Government may
regulate broadcast consistent with the Constitution, even though the same
regulation would run afoul of the First Amendment in the print medium.  Id.
(comparing Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969) with Miami
Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974)).  This is so because
broadcasting has a &quot;uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all
Americans&quot; and &quot;is uniquely accessible to children, even those too
young to read.&quot;  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49.</P>
<P>Third, the Court found the FCC's sanction -- an administrative sanction --
to be an appropriate means of regulating indecent speech.  At the outset of the
opinion, the Court disclaimed that its holding was a &quot;consider[ation of]
any question relating to the possible application of &#167; 1464 as a criminal
statute.&quot;  Id. at 739 n.13.  Later in the opinion, the Court &quot;emphasize[d]
the narrowness of [its] holding&quot;, and explicitly recognized that it had not
held that the Carlin monologue would justify a criminal prosecution.  Id. at
750.  Instead, the Court allowed the FCC to regulate indecent speech with
administrative penalties under a &quot;nuisance&quot; rationale -- &quot;like a
pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard.&quot;  Id. at 750 (citation omitted).</P>
<P>Time has not been kind to the Pacifica decision.  Later cases have eroded
its reach, and the Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed against overreading
the rationale of its holding.</P>
<P>First, in Bolger v. Young Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983), the
Supreme Court refused to extend Pacifica to a law unrelated to broadcasting.  In
that case, a federal law prohibited the unsolicited mailing of contraceptive
advertisements.  Id. at 61.  The Government defended the law by claiming an
interest in protecting children from the advertisements.  The Court rejected
this argument as overbroad:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In [Pacifica], this Court did recognize that the Government's interest in
protecting the young justified special treatment of an afternoon broadcast heard
by adults as well as children.  At the same time, the majority &quot;emphasize[d]
the narrowness of our holding&quot;, explaining that broadcasting is &quot;uniquely
pervasive&quot; and that it is &quot;uniquely accessible to children, even those
too young to read.&quot;  The receipt of mail is far less intrusive and
uncontrollable.  Our decisions have recognized that the special interest of the
Federal Government in regulation of the broadcast media does not readily
translate into a justification for regulation of other means of communication.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 74 (citations and footnotes omitted) (emphasis in original) see also
id. at 72 (&quot;[T]he 'short, though regular, journey from mail box to trash
can . . . is an acceptable burden, at least so far as the Constitution is
concerned.'&quot;) (citation omitted) (alterations in original).</P>
<P>Second, in Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989), the Supreme
Court again limited Pacifica.  In that case, the Court considered the validity
of a ban on indecent &quot;dial-a-porn&quot; communications.  Id. at 117-18.(17)
 As in Bolger, the Government argued that Pacifica justified a complete ban of
that form of speech.  The Supreme Court disagreed, holding instead that
Pacifica's &quot;emphatically narrow&quot; holding arose out of the &quot;unique
attributes of broadcasting&quot;.  Id. at 127.  The Court held that the ban was
unconstitutional.  Id. at 131.</P>
<P>Sable narrowed Pacifica in two ways.  First, the Court implicitly rejected
Pacifica's nuisance rationale for dial-a-porn, holding instead that the
Government could only regulate the medium &quot;by narrowly drawn regulations
designed to serve those interests without unnecessarily interfering with First
Amendment freedoms&quot;.  Id. at 126 (citation omitted).  Under this strict
scrutiny, &quot;[i]t is not enough to show that the Government's ends are
compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends.&quot; 
Id.; see also Fabulous Assoc. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm., 896 F.2d 780,
784-85 (3d Cir. 1990). </P>
<P>Second, the Court concluded that the law, like a law it had struck down in
1957, &quot;denied adults their free speech rights by allowing them to read only
what was acceptable for children&quot;.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 126 (citing Butler
v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380 (1957)).  Thus, any regulation of dial-a-porn would
have to give adults the opportunity to partake of that medium.  Id.  This
conclusion echoes Bolger.  See Bolger, 463 U.S. at 74 (&quot;The level of
discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be
suitable for a sandbox.&quot;).(18)</P>
<P>Finally, in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445 (1994),
the Supreme Court implicitly limited Pacifica once again when it declined to
adopt the broadcast rationale for the medium of cable television.  The Court
concluded that the rules for broadcast were &quot;inapt&quot; for cable because
of the &quot;fundamental technological differences between broadcast and cable
transmission&quot;.  Id. at 2457.</P>
<P>The legal significance to this case of Turner's refusal to apply the
broadcast rules to cable television cannot be overstated.  Turner's holding
confirms beyond doubt that the holding in Pacifica arose out of the scarcity
rationale unique to the underlying technology of broadcasting, and not out of
the end product that the viewer watches.  That is, cable television has no less
of a &quot;uniquely pervasive presence&quot; than broadcast television, nor is
cable television more &quot;uniquely accessible to children&quot; than
broadcast.  See Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49.  From the viewer's perspective,
cable and broadcast television are identical:  moving pictures with sound from a
box in the home.  Whether one receives a signal through an antenna or through a
dedicated wire, the end result is just television in either case.  In declining
to extend broadcast's scarcity rationale for cable, the Supreme Court also
implicitly limited Pacifica, the holding of which flows directly from that
rationale.(19)</P>
<P>Turner thus confirms that the analysis of a particular medium of mass
communication must focus on the underlying technology that brings the
information to the user.  In broadcast, courts focus on the limited number of
band widths and the risk of interference with those frequencies.  See, e.g.,
Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456-57.  In cable, courts focus on the number of
channels, the different kinds of cable operators, and the cost to the consumer. 
Id. at 2452. </P>
<P>I draw two conclusions from the foregoing analysis.  First, from the Supreme
Court's many decisions regulating different media differently, I conclude that
we cannot simply assume that the Government has the power to regulate protected
speech over the Internet, devoting our attention solely to the issue of whether
the CDA is a constitutional exercise of that power.  Rather, we must also decide
the validity of the underlying assumption as well, to wit, whether the
Government has the power to regulate protected speech at all.  That decision
must take into account the underlying technology, and the actual and potential
reach, of that medium.  Second, I conclude that Pacifica's holding is not
persuasive authority here, since plaintiffs and the Government agree that
Internet communication is an abundant and growing resource.  Nor is Sable
persuasive authority, since the Supreme Court's holding in that case addressed
only one particular type of communication (dial-a-porn), and reached no
conclusions about the proper fit between the First Amendment and telephone
communications generally.  Again, plaintiffs and the Government here agree that
the Internet provides content as broad as the imagination.</P>
<P><B>3.  The Effect of the CDA and the Novel Characteristics of Internet
Communication</B></P>
<P>Over the course of five days of hearings and many hundreds of pages of
declarations, deposition transcripts, and exhibits, we have learned about the
special attributes of Internet communication.  Our Findings of fact -- many of
them undisputed -- express our understanding of the Internet.  These Findings
lead to the conclusion that Congress may not regulate indecency on the Internet
at all.  </P>
<P>Four related characteristics of Internet communication have a transcendent
importance to our shared holding that the CDA is unconstitutional on its face. 
We explain these characteristics in our Findings of fact above, and I only
rehearse them briefly here.  First, the Internet presents very low barriers to
entry.  Second, these barriers to entry are identical for both speakers and
listeners.  Third, as a result of these low barriers, astoundingly diverse
content is available on the Internet.  Fourth, the Internet provides significant
access to all who wish to speak in the medium, and even creates a relative
parity among speakers.</P>
<P>To understand how disruptive the CDA is to Internet communication, it must
be remembered that the Internet evolved free of content-based considerations. 
Before the CDA, it only mattered how, and how quickly, a particular packet of
data travelled from one point on the Internet to another.  In its earliest
incarnation as the ARPANET, the Internet was for many years a private means of
access among the military, defense contractors, and defense-related researchers.
 The developers of  the technology focused on creating a medium designed for the
rapid transmittal of the information through overlapping and redundant
connections, and without direct human involvement.  Out of these considerations
evolved the common transfer protocols, packet switching, and the other
technology in which today's Internet users flourish.  The content of the data
was, before the CDA, an irrelevant consideration.</P>
<P>It is fair, then, to conclude that the benefits of the Internet to private
speakers arose out of the serendipitous development of its underlying
technology.  As more networks joined the &quot;network of networks&quot; that is
the Internet, private speakers have begun to take advantage of the medium.  This
should not be surprising, since participation in the medium requires only that
networks (and the individual users associated with them) agree to use the common
data transfer protocols and other medium-specific technology.  Participation
does not require, and has never required, approval of a user's or network's
content.</P>
<P>After the CDA, however, the content of a user's speech will determine the
extent of participation in the new medium.  If a speaker's content is even
arguably indecent in some communities, he must assess, inter alia, the risk of
prosecution and the cost of compliance with the CDA.  Because the creation and
posting of a Web site allows users anywhere in the country to see that site,
many speakers will no doubt censor their speech so that it is palatable in every
community.  Other speakers will decline to enter the medium at all.  Unlike
other media, there is no technologically feasible way for an Internet speaker to
limit the geographical scope of his speech (even if he wanted to), or to &quot;implement[]
a system for screening the locale of incoming&quot; requests.  Sable 492 U.S. at
125.</P>
<P>The CDA will, without doubt, undermine the substantive, speech-enhancing
benefits that have flowed from the Internet. Barriers to entry to those speakers
affected by the Act would skyrocket, especially for non-commercial and
not-for-profit information providers.  Such costs include those attributable to
age or credit card verification (if possible), tagging (if tagging is even a
defense under the Act(20)), and monitoring or review of one's content. </P>
<P>The diversity of the content will necessarily diminish as a result.  The
economic costs associated with compliance with the Act will drive from the
Internet speakers whose content falls within the zone of possible prosecution. 
Many Web sites, newsgroups, and chat rooms will shut down, since users cannot
discern the age of other participants.  In this respect, the Internet would
ultimately come to mirror broadcasting and print, with messages tailored to a
mainstream society from speakers who could be sure that their message was likely
decent in every community in the country.</P>
<P>The CDA will also skew the relative parity among speakers that currently
exists on the Internet.  Commercial entities who can afford the costs of
verification, or who would charge a user to enter their sites, or whose content
has mass appeal, will remain unaffected by the Act.  Other users, such as
Critical Path or Stop Prisoner Rape, or even the ACLU, whose Web sites before
the CDA were as equally accessible as the most popular Web sites, will be
profoundly affected by the Act.  This change would result in an Internet that
mirrors broadcasting and print, where economic power has become relatively
coterminous with influence.</P>
<P>Perversely, commercial pornographers would remain relatively unaffected by
the Act, since we learned that most of them already use credit card or adult
verification anyway.  Commercial pornographers normally provide a few free
pictures to entice a user into proceeding further into the Web site.  To proceed
beyond these teasers, users must provide a credit card number or adult
verification number.  The CDA will force these businesses to remove the teasers
(or cover the most salacious content with cgi scripts), but the core, commercial
product of these businesses will remain in place. </P>
<P>The CDA's wholesale disruption on the Internet will necessarily affect adult
participation in the medium.  As some speakers leave or refuse to enter the
medium, and others bowdlerize their speech or erect the barriers that the Act
envisions, and still others remove bulletin boards, Web sites, and newsgroups,
adults will face a shrinking ability to participate in the medium.  Since much
of the communication on the Internet is participatory, i.e., is a form of
dialogue, a decrease in the number of speakers, speech fora, and permissible
topics will diminish the worldwide dialogue that is the strength and signal
achievement of the medium.</P>
<P>It is no answer to say that the defenses and exclusions of &#167; 223(e)
mitigate the disruptive forces of the Act.  We have already found as facts that
the defenses either are not available to plaintiffs here or would impose
excessive costs on them.  These defenses are also unavailable to participants in
specific forms of Internet communication.</P>
<P>I am equally dubious that the exclusions of &#167; 223(e) would provide
significant relief from the Act.  The &quot;common carrier&quot; exclusion of &#167;
223(e)(1), for example, would not insulate America Online from liability for the
content it provides to its subscribers.  It is also a tricky question whether an
America Online chat room devoted to, say, women's reproductive health, is or is
not speech of the service itself, since America Online, at least to some extent,
&quot;creat[es] the content of the communication&quot; simply by making the room
available and assigning it a topic.  Even if America Online has no liability
under this example, the service might legitimately choose not to provide fora
that led to the prosecution of its subscribers.  Similarly, it is unclear
whether many caching servers are devoted &quot;solely&quot; to the task of &quot;intermediate
storage&quot;.  The &quot;vicarious liability&quot; exclusion of &#167;
223(e)(4) would not, for example, insulate either a college professor or her
employer from liability for posting an indecent online reading assignment for
her freshman sociology class.</P>
<P>We must of course give appropriate deference to the legislative judgments of
Congress.  See Sable, 492 U.S. at 129; Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2472-73 (Blackmun,
J., concurring).  After hearing the parties' testimony and reviewing the
exhibits, declarations, and transcripts, we simply cannot in my view defer to
Congress's judgment that the CDA will have only a minimal impact on the
technology of the Internet, or on adult participation in the medium.  As in
Sable, &quot;[d]eference to a legislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry
when First Amendment rights are at stake.&quot;  Sable, 492 U.S. at 129
(citation omitted).  Indeed, the Government has not revealed Congress's &quot;extensive
record&quot; in addressing this issue, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2472 (Blackmun, J.,
concurring), or otherwise convinced me that the record here is somehow factually
deficient to the record before Congress when it passed the Act.  </P>
<H1> 4.  Diversity and Access on the Internet</H1>
<P>Nearly eighty years ago, Justice Holmes, in dissent, wrote of the ultimate
constitutional importance of the &quot;free trade in ideas&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[W]hen men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may
come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own
conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas
-- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself
accepted in the competition of the market . . . .</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting). 
</P>
<P>For nearly as long, critics have attacked this much-maligned &quot;marketplace&quot;
theory of First Amendment jurisprudence as inconsistent with economic and
practical reality.  Most marketplaces of mass speech, they charge, are dominated
by a few wealthy voices.  Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241,
248-50 (1974).  These voices dominate -- and to an extent, create -- the
national debate.  Id.  Individual citizens' participation is, for the most part,
passive.  Id. at 251.  Because most people lack the money and time to buy a
broadcast station or create a newspaper, they are limited to the role of
listeners, i.e., as watchers of television or subscribers to newspapers.  Id.</P>
<P>Economic realities limit the number of speakers even further.  Newspapers
competing with each other and with (free) broadcast tend toward extinction, as
fixed costs drive competitors either to consolidate or leave the marketplace. 
Id. at 249-50.  As a result, people receive information from relatively few
sources:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The elimination of competing newspapers in most of our large cities, and the
concentration of control of media that results from the only newspaper's being
owned by the same interests which own a television station and a radio station,
are important components of this trend toward concentration of control of
outlets to inform the public.</P>
<P>The result of these vast changes has been to place in a few hands the power
to inform the American people and shape public opinion.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 249.</P>
<P>The Supreme Court has also recognized that the advent of cable television
has not offered significant relief from this problem.  Although the number of
cable channels is exponentially greater than broadcast, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at
2452, cable imposes relatively high entry costs, id. at 2451-52 (noting that the
creation of a cable system requires &quot;[t]he construction of [a] physical
infrastructure&quot;).</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has resisted governmental efforts to
alleviate these market dysfunctions.  In Tornillo, the Supreme Court held that
market failure simply could not justify the regulation of print, 418 U.S. at
258, regardless of the validity of the criticisms of that medium, id. at 251. 
Tornillo invalidated a state &quot;right-of-reply&quot; statute, which required
a newspaper critical of a political candidate to give that candidate equal time
to reply to the charges.  Id. at 244.  The Court held that the statute would be
invalid even if it imposed no cost on a newspaper, because of the statute's
intrusion into editorial discretion:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A newspaper is more than a passive receptacle or conduit for news, comment,
and advertising.  The choice of material to go into a newspaper, and the
decisions made as to limitations on the size and content of the paper, and
treatment of public issues and public officials -- whether fair or unfair --
constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 258.</P>
<P>Similarly, in Turner, the Supreme Court rejected the Government's argument
that market dysfunction justified deferential review of speech regulations for
cable television.  Even recognizing that the cable market &quot;suffers certain
structural impediments&quot;, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2457, the Court could not
accept the Government's conclusion that this dysfunction justified
broadcast-type standards of review, since &quot;the mere assertion of
dysfunction or failure in a speech market, without more, is not sufficient to
shield a speech regulation from the First Amendment standards applicable to
nonbroadcast media.&quot;  Id. at 2458.  &quot;[L]aws that single out the press,
or certain elements thereof, for special treatment 'pose a particular danger of
abuse by the State,' and so are always subject to at least some degree of
heightened First Amendment scrutiny.&quot;  Id. (citation omitted).(21)  The
Court then eloquently reiterated that government-imposed, content-based speech
regulations are generally inconsistent with &quot;[o]ur political system and
cultural life&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that each person
should decide for him or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression,
consideration, and adherence.  Our political system and cultural life rest upon
this ideal.  Government action that stifles speech on account of its message, or
that requires the utterance of a particular message favored by the Government,
contravenes this essential right.  Laws of this sort pose the inherent risk that
the Government seeks not to advance a legitimate regulatory goal, but to
suppress unpopular ideas or information or manipulate the public debate through
coercion rather than persuasion.  These restrictions &quot;rais[e] the specter
that the Government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the
marketplace.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. (citation omitted).</P>
<P>Both Tornillo and Turner recognize, in essence, that the cure for market
dysfunction (government-imposed, content-based speech restrictions) will almost
always be worse than the disease.  Here, however, I am hard-pressed even to
identify the disease.  It is no exaggeration to conclude that the Internet has
achieved, and continues to achieve, the most participatory marketplace of mass
speech that this country -- and indeed the world -- has yet seen.  The
plaintiffs in these actions correctly describe the &quot;democratizing&quot;
effects of Internet communication:  individual citizens of limited means can
speak to a worldwide audience on issues of concern to them.  Federalists and
Anti-Federalists may debate the structure of their government nightly, but these
debates occur in newsgroups or chat rooms rather than in pamphlets.  Modern-day
Luthers still post their theses, but to electronic bulletin boards rather than
the door of the Wittenberg Schlosskirche.  More mundane (but from a
constitutional perspective, equally important) dialogue occurs between aspiring
artists, or French cooks, or dog lovers, or fly fishermen.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Government's asserted &quot;failure&quot; of the Internet rests
on the implicit premise that too much speech occurs in that medium, and that
speech there is too available to the participants.  This is exactly the benefit
of Internet communication, however.  The Government, therefore, implicitly asks
this court to limit both the amount of speech on the Internet and the
availability of that speech.  This argument is profoundly repugnant to First
Amendment principles.</P>
<P>My examination of the special characteristics of Internet communication, and
review of the Supreme Court's medium-specific First Amendment jurisprudence,
lead me to conclude that the Internet deserves the broadest possible protection
from government-imposed, content-based regulation.  If &quot;the First Amendment
erects a virtually insurmountable barrier between government and the print media&quot;,
Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 259 (White, J., concurring), even though the print medium
fails to achieve the hoped-for diversity in the marketplace of ideas, then that
&quot;insurmountable barrier&quot; must also exist for a medium that succeeds in
achieving that diversity.  If our Constitution &quot;prefer[s] 'the power of
reason as applied through public discussion'&quot;, id. (citation omitted), &quot;[r]egardless
of how beneficent-sounding the purposes of controlling the press might be&quot;,
id., even though &quot;occasionally debate on vital matters will not be
comprehensive and . . . all viewpoints may not be expressed&quot;, id. at 260, a
medium that does capture comprehensive debate and does allow for the expression
of all viewpoints should receive at least the same protection from intrusion. 
</P>
<P>Finally, if the goal of our First Amendment jurisprudence is the &quot;individual
dignity and choice&quot; that arises from &quot;putting the decision as to what
views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us&quot;, Leathers v.
Medlock, 499 U.S. 439, 448-49 (1991) (citing Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15,
24 (1971)), then we should be especially vigilant in preventing content-based
regulation of a medium that every minute allows individual citizens actually to
make those decisions.  Any content-based regulation of the Internet, no matter
how benign the purpose, could burn the global village to roast the pig.  Cf.
Butler, 352 U.S. at 383.</P>
<H1> 5.  Protection of Children from Pornography</H1>
<P>I accept without reservation that the Government has a compelling interest
in protecting children from pornography.  The proposition finds one of its
clearest expressions in Mill, who recognized that his exposition regarding
liberty itself &quot;is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of
their faculties&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We are not speaking of children or of young persons below the age which the

law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood.  Those who are still in a state to
require being taken care of by others must be protected against their own
actions as well as against external injury.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>John Stuart Mill, On Liberty 69 (Gertrude Himmelfarb ed., Penguin Books
1982) (1859), cited in Harry Kalven Jr., A Worthy Tradition 54 (Jamie Kalven ed.
1988).</P>
<P>This rationale, however, is as dangerous as it is compelling.  Laws
regulating speech for the protection of children have no limiting principle, and
a well-intentioned law restricting protected speech on the basis of its content
is, nevertheless, state-sponsored censorship.  Regulations that &quot;drive
certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace&quot; for children's benefit,
Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S. at 116, risk destroying the very &quot;political
system and cultural life&quot;, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2458, that they will
inherit when they come of age.</P>
<P>I therefore have no doubt that a Newspaper Decency Act, passed because
Congress discovered that young girls had read a front page article in the New
York Times on female genital mutilation in Africa, would be unconstitutional. 
Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 258.  Nor would a Novel Decency Act, adopted after
legislators had seen too many pot-boilers in convenience store book racks, pass
constitutional muster.  Butler, 352 U.S. at 383.  There is no question that a
Village Green Decency Act, the fruit of a Senator's overhearing of a ribald
conversation between two adolescent boys on a park bench, would be
unconstitutional.  Perry Education Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460
U.S. 37, 45 (1983).  A Postal Decency Act, passed because of constituent
complaints about unsolicited lingerie catalogues, would also be

unconstitutional.  Bolger, 463 U.S. at 73.  In these forms of communication,
regulations on the basis of decency simply would not survive First Amendment
scrutiny.  </P>
<P>The Internet is a far more speech-enhancing medium than print, the village
green, or the mails.  Because it would necessarily affect the Internet itself,
the CDA would necessarily reduce the speech available for adults on the medium. 
This is a constitutionally intolerable result.</P>
<P>Some of the dialogue on the Internet surely tests the limits of conventional
discourse.  Speech on the Internet can be unfiltered, unpolished, and
unconventional, even emotionally charged, sexually explicit, and vulgar -- in a
word, &quot;indecent&quot; in many communities.  But we should expect such
speech to occur in a medium in which citizens from all walks of life have a
voice.  We should also protect the autonomy that such a medium confers to
ordinary people as well as media magnates.</P>
<P>Moreover, the CDA will almost certainly fail to accomplish the Government's
interest in shielding children from pornography on the Internet.  Nearly half of
Internet communications originate outside the United States, and some percentage
of that figure represents pornography.  Pornography from, say, Amsterdam will be
no less appealing to a child on the Internet than pornography from New York
City, and residents of Amsterdam have little incentive to comply with the
CDA.(22)</P>
<P>My analysis does not deprive the Government of all means of protecting
children from the dangers of Internet communication.  The Government can
continue to protect children from pornography on the Internet through vigorous
enforcement of existing laws criminalizing obscenity and child pornography.  See
United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701, 704-05 (6th Cir. 1995).  As we learned at
the hearing, there is also a compelling need for public education about the
benefits and dangers of this new medium, and the Government can fill that role
as well.  In my view, our action today should only mean that the Government's
permissible supervision of Internet content stops at the traditional line of
unprotected speech.</P>
<P>Parents, too, have options available to them.  As we learned at the hearing,
parents can install blocking software on their home computers, or they can
subscribe to commercial online services that provide parental controls.  It is
quite clear that powerful market forces are at work to expand parental options
to deal with these legitimate concerns.  More fundamentally, parents can
supervise their children's use of the Internet or deny their children the
opportunity to participate in the medium until they reach an appropriate age. 
See Fabulous, 896 F.2d at 788-89 (noting that &quot;our society has
traditionally placed&quot; these decisions &quot;on the shoulders of the parent&quot;).</P>
<P><B>E.</B>  <B>Conclusion</B></P>
<P>Cutting through the acronyms and argot that littered the hearing testimony,
the Internet may fairly be regarded as a never-ending worldwide conversation. 
The Government may not, through the CDA, interrupt that conversation.  As the
most participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the Internet deserves the
highest protection from governmental intrusion.</P>
<P>True it is that many find some of the speech on the Internet to be
offensive, and amid the din of cyberspace many hear discordant voices that they
regard as indecent.  The absence of governmental regulation of Internet content
has unquestionably produced a kind of chaos, but as one of plaintiffs' experts
put it with such resonance at the hearing:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What achieved success was the very chaos that the Internet is.  The strength

of the Internet is that chaos.(23)  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the strength of our
liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the First
Amendment protects. </P>
<P>For these reasons, I without hesitation hold that the CDA is
unconstitutional on its face.</P>

<P>(5)The Act does not define &quot;telecommunications device&quot;.  By Order
dated February 27, 1996, we asked the parties to address whether a modem is a &quot;telecommunications
device&quot;.  Plaintiffs and the Government answered in the affirmative, and we
agree that the plain meaning of the phrase and the legislative history of the
Act strongly support their conclusion.  &quot;Telecommunications&quot; under 47
U.S.C. &#167; 153(48) means &quot;the transmission, between or among points
specified by the user, of information of the user's choosing, without change in
the form of content of the information as sent and received.&quot;  The plain
meaning of &quot;device&quot; is &quot;something that is formed or formulated by
design and usu[ally] with consideration of possible alternatives, experiment,
and testing.&quot;  Webster's Third New International Dictionary, 618 (1986). 
Clearly, the sponsors of the CDA thought it would reach individual Internet
users, many of whom still connect through modems.  See, e.g., 141 Cong. Rec.
S8329-46 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (statements of Sen. Exon and Sen. Coats).</P>
<P>The resolution of the tension between the scope of &quot;telecommunications
device&quot; and the scope of &quot;interactive computer service&quot; as
defined in 47 U.S.C. &#167; 230(a)(2), see infra note 6, must await another day.
 It is sufficient for us to conclude that the exclusion of &#167; 223(h)(1)(B)
is probably a narrow one (as the Government has argued), insulating an
interactive computer service from criminal liability under the CDA but not
insulating users who traffic in indecent and patently offensive materials on the
Internet through those services.</P>
<P>(6)The statute at &#167; 509 amends 47 U.S.C. to add &#167; 230(e)(2), which
defines such a service as &quot;any information service, system, or access
software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to
a computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides
access to the Internet and such systems operated or services offered by
libraries or educational institutions.&quot;</P>
<P>(7)In the Government's Opposition to plaintiffs' motion for a temporary
restraining order in C.A. No. 96-963, it notes &quot;the Department has a
longstanding policy that previous such provisions are unconstitutional and will
not be enforced&quot;, and that both President Clinton and General Reno &quot;have
made th[e] point clear&quot; that no one will be prosecuted under &quot;the
abortion-related provision of newly-amended 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1462(c).&quot; 
Opposition at 19, n.11 (February 14, 1996).  In view of this &quot;longstanding
policy&quot;, the Government contends there is no realistic fear of prosecution
and, so the argument goes, no need for equitable relief.  Id.  In their
post-hearing brief, the ACLU plaintiffs inform us that in view of the
Government's statement, &quot;they do not seek a preliminary injunction against

the enforcement of &#167; 1462(c).&quot;  Post-Trial Brief of ACLU Plaintiffs at

2 n.2.</P>
<P>(8)The court again expresses its appreciation to the parties for their
cooperative attitude in evolving the stipulation.</P>
<P>(9)The Government has not by motion challenged the standing of any plaintiff
in either case, and we harbor no doubts of our own on that point,
notwithstanding the Government's suggestion in a footnote of its post-hearing
brief.  See Defendants' Post-Hearing Memorandum at 37 n.46 (&quot;Plaintiffs'
assertions as to the speech at issue are so off-point as to raise standing
concerns.&quot;).  Descriptions of these plaintiffs, as well as of the nature
and content of the speech they contend is or may be affected by the CDA, are set
forth in paragraphs 70 through 356 at pages 30 through 103 of the parties'
stipulation filed in these actions.  These paragraphs will not be reproduced
here, but will be deemed adopted as Findings of the court.</P>
<P>(10)It became clear from the testimony that moderated newsgroups are the
exception and unmoderated newsgroups are the rule.</P>
<P>(11)The evidence adduced at the hearings provided detail to this paragraph
of the parties' stipulation.  See Findings 95 to 107.</P>
<P>(12)Testimony adduced at the hearing suggests that market forces exist to
limit the availability of material on-line that parents consider inappropriate
for their children.  Although the parties sharply dispute the efficacy of
so-called &quot;parental empowerment&quot; software, there is a sufficiently
wide zone of agreement on what is available to restrict access to unwanted sites
that the parties were able to enter into twenty-one paragraphs of stipulated
facts on the subject, which form the basis of paragraphs 49 through 69 of our
Findings of fact.  Because of the rapidity of developments in this field, some

of the technological facts we have found may become partially obsolete by the
time of publication of these Findings.</P>
<P>(13)This membership is constantly growing, according to the testimony of
Albert Vezza, Chairman of the World Wide Web Consortium.  See also Defendants'
Ex. D-167.</P>
<P>(14)See also Defendants' Ex. D-174 and the testimony of Mr. Vezza.</P>
<P>(15) From this point, our Findings are, unless noted, no longer based upon
the parties' stipulation, but upon the record adduced at the hearings.  </P>
<P>(16)Mr. Bradner is a member of the Internet Engineering Task Force, the
group primarily responsible for Internet technical standards, as well as other
Internet-related associations responsible for, among other things, the
prevailing Internet Protocols.  He is also associated with Harvard University.</P>
<P>(17)Dr. Olsen chairs the Computer Science Department at Brigham Young
University in Provo, Utah, and is the recently-appointed Director of the Human
Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>(18)The term &quot;information content provider&quot; is defined in &#167;
509 of the CDA, at the new 47 U.S.C. &#167; 230(e)(3), as &quot;any person or
entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development
of information provided through the Internet or any other interactive computer
service.&quot;</P>
<P>(19)By &quot;verification&quot;, we mean the method by which a user types in
his or her credit card number, and the Web site ensures that the credit card is
valid before it allows the user to enter the site.</P>
<P>(20)InterNIC is a naming organization, not a regulator of content.  InterNIC
and two other European organizations maintain a master list of domain names to
ensure that no duplication occurs.  Creators of Web sites must register their
domain name with InterNIC, and the agency will instruct the creator to choose
another name if the new Web site has the name of an already-existing site. 
InterNIC has no control over content on a site after registration.</P>
<P>(21)This paragraph and the preceding paragraph also illustrate that a
content provider might store its own material or someone else's on a caching
server.  The goal -- saving money and time -- is the same in both cases.</P>
<H2>Notes (Judge Sloviter)</H2>
<P>(1)It also probably covers speech protected by the First Amendment for some
minors a well, because it fails to limit its reach to that which is harmful for
minors, an issue which it is not necessary to decide in light of the other
conclusions reached.</P>
<P>(2)See 141 Cong. Rec. S8342 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (letter from Kent
Markus, Acting Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, to
Senator Leahy).</P>
<H2>Notes (Judge Buckwalter)</H2>
<P>(1)If by virtue of the statute's authorization of expedited review of its
constitutionality, &quot;on its face,&quot; 47 U.S.C. &#167;561(a), we were
strictly limited to looking at the words of the statute, I would stand by my
T.R.O. opinion.  However, in light of the procedures which are required by 47
U.S.C. &#167; 561(a) and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2284, and were followed by this court
in establishing an extensive record in this case, to ignore the evidence
presented would be to ignore what an action for injunctive relief is all about.</P>
<P>Section 561 reads as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&#167; 561.  EXPEDITED REVIEW.</P>
<P>(a) THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT HEARING -- Notwithstanding any other
provision of law, any civil action challenging the constitutionality, on its
face, of this title or any amendment made by this title, or any provision
thereof, shall be heard by a district court of 3 judges convened pursuant to the
provisions of section 2284 of title 28, United States Code.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Section 2284 states, in relevant part:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&#167; 2284.  <B>Three-judge court; when required; composition; procedure</B>
 </P>
<P>(b) In any action required to be heard and determined by a district court of
three judges under subsection (a) of this section, the composition and procedure
of the court shall be as follows:  . . .</P>
<P>(3) A single judge may conduct all proceedings except the trial . . . . He
may grant a temporary restraining order on a specific finding, based on evidence
submitted, that specified irreparable damages will result if the order is not
granted, which order, unless previously revoked by the district judge, shall
remain in force only until the hearing and determination by the district court
of three judges of an application for a preliminary injunction. . . . </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(2)Justice Kennedy argues in his opinion in Simon &amp; Schuster v. New York
Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 120 (1991), that &quot;[t]he regulated content
has the full protection of the First Amendment and this, I submit, is itself a
full and sufficient reason for holding the statute unconstitutional.  In my view
it is both unnecessary and incorrect to ask whether the state can show that the
statute 'is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn
to achieve that end.'&quot;  In the present case, there is no disagreement that
indecent and patently offensive speech have the full protection of the First
Amendment.</P>
<P>(3)Not only has speech been divided up and given values -- with some types
of speech given little or no protection (obscenity, fighting words, possibly
commercial speech) -- but also, by court decisions over the years, it has been
decided that the content of speech can indeed be regulated provided that the
regulation will directly and materially advance a compelling government
interest, and that it is narrowly tailored to accomplish that interest in the
least restrictive manner.  However, any content-based restriction must survive
this most exacting scrutiny.  Sable, 492 U.S. 115; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S.
397 (1989).</P>
<P>(4)The plaintiffs have made facial challenges to the disputed provisions of
the CDA on grounds of both vagueness and overbreadth.  The approach taken and
language used in evaluating a statute under each of these doctrines commingles,
and frequently is treated as a single approach.  &quot;We have traditionally
viewed vagueness and overbreadth as logically related and similar doctrines.&quot;
 Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 n.8 (1983) (citing Keyishian v. Board of
Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 609, (1967); NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963)). 
Even in cases where the court attempts to distinguish these two doctrines, it
acknowledges some interplay between them.  <I>See e.g.</I> Village of Hoffman
Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 494, and n. 6 (1982).</P>
<P>In addition, when discussing overbreadth, one cannot avoid reference to the
same language used to describe and apply the strict scrutiny standard to
constitutionally protected activities.  <I>See e.g.</I> Sable, 492 U.S. at 131;
Roberts v. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 623 (1984).  While there are occasional
attempts to argue for clear distinctions among these doctrines, <I>see e.g.</I>
Kolender, 461 U.S. at 369 (White, J., Rehnquist, J. dissenting), such bright
lines simply have not been, and most likely cannot be, drawn in this area.</P>
<P>(5)Comparing a different portion of each of these two provisions suggests
that different terms are not to be read to mean the same thing.  As written,
section (a) pertains to telecommunications devices, and section (d) to
interactive computer services.  While we have not entirely resolved the tension
between these definitions at this stage, it has been established that these
terms are not synonymous, but are in fact intended to denote different
technologies.  This, together with the rule of statutory construction set forth
in Chief Judge Sloviter's opinion, seems to suggest on the face of the statute
that indecent and patently offensive also are not to be read as synonymous.</P>
<P>(6)18 U.S.C. &#167;1461 states, &quot;The term `indecent' as used in this
section includes matter of a character tending to incite arson, murder or
assassination.&quot;</P>
<P>(7)Although the Supreme Court may rule on the vagueness question in the
context of cable television regulation in Alliance for Community Media v. FCC,
56 F.3d 105 (D.C. Cir. 1995), currently pending on certiorari before the Court,
we will not defer adjudication of this issue as the constitutionality of the
term in the cable context may not be determinative of its use in cyberspace.</P>
<P>(8)Each intentional act of posting indecent content for display shall be
considered a separate violation of this subsection and carries with it a fine, a
prison term of up to two years, or both.  47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(a),(d) and Conf.
Rep. at 189.</P>
<P>(9)As I have noted, the unique nature of the medium cannot be overemphasized
in discussing and determining the vagueness issue.  This is not to suggest that
new technology should drive constitutional law.  To the contrary, I remain of
the belief that our fundamental constitutional principles can accommodate any
technological achievements, even those which, presently seem to many to be in
the nature of a miracle such as the Internet.</P>
<H2>Notes (Judge Dalzell)</H2>
<P>(1)By Order dated March 13, 1996, we asked the parties to submit their views
on questions regarding allocation of the burdens of proof in these cases.  Since
I believe that the outcome of these cases is clear regardless of the allocation
of proof between the parties, none of my conclusions in this opinion requires me
to choose between the arguments that the parties have presented to us.</P>
<P>(2)Although I do not believe the statue is unconstitutionally vague, I agree
with Judge Buckwalter that the Government's promise not to enforce the plain
reach of the law cannot salvage its overbreadth.  Even accepting the
Government's argument that prosecution of non-obscene pornography would be a &quot;legitimate
application&quot; of the CDA, City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 459 (1987),
it is clear that the Act would &quot;make unlawful a substantial amount of
constitutionally protected conduct&quot;, id.  As in Hill, the Government's
circular reasoning -- that the law is constitutional because prosecutors would
only apply it to those against whom it could constitutionally be applied -- must
fail.  See id. at 464-67.</P>
<P>(3)Plaintiffs have argued that we may consider their challenge under the
standards governing both &quot;facial&quot; and &quot;as-applied&quot;
challenges.  That is, they suggest that we may pass judgment on the decency of
the plaintiffs' speech, even if we are unable to conclude that the act is
facially unconstitutional.  Surely this procedural confusion arises out of the
three opinions of the D.C. Circuit in National Treasury Employees Union v.
United States, 990 F.3d 1271, 1279-80 (D.C. Cir. 1993), aff'd, 115 S. Ct. 1003.</P>
<P>I doubt that we could undertake an as-applied inquiry, since we do not know
the exact content of plaintiffs' speech.  Indeed, it is impossible to know the
exact content of some plaintiffs' speech, since plaintiffs themselves cannot
know that content.  America Online, for example, cannot know what its
subscribers will spontaneously say in chat rooms or post to bulletin boards.  In
any event, I need not address this issue, in the light of our disposition today.</P>
<P>(4)&quot;Dial-a-porn&quot; is a shorthand description of &quot;sexually
oriented prerecorded telephone messages&quot;.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 117-18.</P>
<P>(5)In turn, Pacifica's definition of indecency has its roots in the Supreme
Court's obscenity jurisprudence.  Indecency includes some but not all of the
elements of obscenity.  See, e.g., Alliance for Community Media, 56 F.3d at
113-14 n.4.</P>
<P>(6)The reach of the two provisions is not coterminous, however.  As we
explain in the introduction to this Adjudication, &#167; 223(a) reaches the
making, creation, transmission, and initiation of indecent speech.  Section
223(d) arguably reaches more broadly to the &quot;display&quot; of indecent
speech.  I conclude here only that both sections refer to the identical type of
proscribed speech.</P>
<P>(7)At oral argument, counsel for the Government candidly recognized that &quot;there's
nothing quite like this statute before&quot;, and that the CDA's novelty raised
some &quot;legislative craftsmanship problem[s]&quot;.  Transcript of May 10,
1996, at 81-82.  I believe that my analysis here makes sense in the light of the
legislative history and the jurisprudence on which Congress relied in enacting
the CDA.  See Senate Report at 188, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201-02.</P>
<P>(8)The counterargument is that &#167; 223(e)(5)(A), when read together with &#167;
223(e)(6), merely confers jurisdiction on the FCC to prescribe the &quot;reasonable,
effective, and appropriate actions&quot; that count as defenses.  Congress
employed a similar scheme for dial-a-porn.  See Dial Information Servs., 938
F.2d at 1539 (citing 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(b)(3)); Information Providers'
Coalition, 928 F.2d at 871.</P>
<P>(9)The play was &quot;critically acclaimed and long-running in Los Angeles
area theaters&quot;.  Infinity Broadcasting, 3 FCC R. at 932.</P>
<P>(10)Analytically, it makes sense that indecent speech has public value. 
After all, indecent speech is nevertheless protected speech, see, e.g., Sable,
492 U.S. at 126, and it must therefore have some public value that underlies the
need for protection.  Obscenity, by contrast, has no public value, id. at 124,
and thus has no protection from proscription.</P>
<P>(11)Internet technology undercuts the Government's argument that the &quot;in
context&quot; element of &#167;&#167; 223(a) and 223(d) would insulate
plaintiffs such as Critical Path from liability.  See, e.g., Transcript of May
10, 1996, at 89-91.  A user who clicks on a link in the Critical Path database
(see Findings 33, 77-78) might travel to a highly graphic page in a larger HTML
document.  The social value of that page, in context, might be debatable, but
the use of links effectively excerpts that document by eliminating content
unrelated to the link.</P>
<P>(12)Moreover, because of the technology of Internet relay chat, it would
need to make this determination before it organized the chat room, since it
could not pre-screen the discussion among the participants.  Thus, it would need
to predict, in advance, what the participants were likely to say.  The
participants would need to make a similar determination, unaided (I expect) by
First Amendment lawyers.</P>
<P>(13)Testimony of April 12, 1996, at 235-36.</P>
<P>(14)In this section I do not imply that the FCC has jurisdiction to process
Internet complaints in the same manner as it does for broadcast.  The extent of
the FCC's jurisdiction under the CDA is a sticky question not relevant here. 
See Senate Report at 190-91, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 204.  Because the
administrative decisions cited above arose out of citizens' complaints to the
FCC, however, they provide a kind of surrogate insight into the kinds of speech
that citizens have charged as indecent in the past.</P>
<P>(15)See Finding of fact 81.  See also Symposium, Emerging Media:  Technology
and the First Amendment, 104 Yale L.J. 1613 (1995).</P>
<P>(16)A narrow holding for this new medium also will not eliminate the chill
to plaintiffs, who could well stifle the extent of their participation in this
new medium while awaiting a future iteration of the CDA.  Such a holding would
also lead Congress to believe that a rewritten CDA (using, for example, a &quot;harmful
to minors&quot; standard, see Senate Report at 189, reprinted in 1996
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 202) would pass constitutional muster.  In my view, a holding
consistent with the novel qualities of this medium provides Congress with prompt
and clear answers to the questions that the CDA asks.</P>
<P>(17)The history of dial-a-porn regulation both before and after Sable is
tortuous, and involves the intervention of all three branches of government.  I
will not rehearse that history here, deferring instead to the other courts that
have recounted it. See, e.g., Sable, 492 U.S. at 118-23; Dial Information Serv.,
938 F.2d at 1537-40; Information Providers Coalition, 928 F.2d at 870-73.</P>
<P>(18)Sable is arguably not a decision about mass communication.  Unlike Red
Lion, Tornillo, or Turner, the Court in Sable reached no conclusions about the
proper fit between the First Amendment and governmental regulation of the
telephone.  The case also includes no discussion of the technology of the
telephone generally.  The plaintiff in that case, a purveyor of dial-a-porn,
challenged the statute only with respect to that type of content.  Sable, 492
U.S. at 117-18.  Thus, the Court's opinion discussed only the &quot;dial-in
services&quot;.  Id. at 128.  Since every telephone call at issue was, by
definition, dial-a-porn, every telephone call was, by definition, either obscene
or indecent.  Id. at 132 (Scalia, J., concurring).</P>
<P>Here, however, plaintiffs represent forty-seven different speakers
(including educational associations and consortia) who provide content to the
Internet on a broad range of topics.  The limited reach of the Sable holding
renders it inapt to the Internet communications of the plaintiffs in these
actions.</P>
<P>(19)I note here, too, that we have found as a fact that operation of a
computer is not as simple as turning on a television, and that the assaultive
nature of television, see Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49, is quite absent in
Internet use.  See Findings 87-89.  The use of warnings and headings, for
example, will normally shield users from immediate entry into a sexually
explicit Web site or newsgroup message.  See Finding 88.  The Government may
well be right that sexually explicit content is just a few clicks of a mouse
away from the user, but there is an immense legal significance to those few
clicks.</P>
<P>(20)In a May 3, 1996 letter to a three-judge court in the Southern District
of New York, John C. Keeney, Acting Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal
Division of the Department of Justice, has advised that tagging would be &quot;substantial
evidence&quot; in support of a &#167; 223(e)(5)(A) defense:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under present technology, non-commercial content providers can take steps to
list their site[s] in URL registries of covered sites, register their site[s]
with the marketplace of browsers and blocking software (including listing an IP
address), place their material in a directory blocked by screening software, or
take other similarly effective affirmative steps to make their site[s] known to
the world to allow the site[s] to be blocked.  Under present technology, it is
the position of the Department of Justice that, absent extraordinary
circumstances, such efforts would constitute substantial evidence that a content
provider had taken good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions
under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors to the covered
material.  The same would be true for tagging by content providers coupled with
evidence that the tag would be screened by the marketplace of browsers and
blocking software.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Letter of May 3, 1996 from Acting Assistant Attorney General John C. Keeney
to Hons. Denise L. Cote, Leonard B. Sand, and Jose A. Cabranes, attached to
Defendants' Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Statement.  On May 8, 1996,
the Government moved to file the Kenney letter in this action, and we granted
the motion as unopposed the next day.</P>
<P>The letter certainly raises more questions than it answers.  I wonder, for
example, whether it is consistent with the plain language of the Act simply for
content providers to &quot;make their site[s] known to the world&quot; and
thereby &quot;to allow [them] to be blocked&quot;, even though this form of
notice alone would not reduce the availability of indecent content.  Cf. Senate
Report at 178, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201 (noting that &#167; 223(d) &quot;applies
to content providers who post indecent material for online display without
taking precautions that shield that material from minors&quot;).  It is also an
unanswered question whether the Keeney letter would eliminate any of the CDA's
chill, since the Government acknowledged that the letter would not prohibit a
United States Attorney from taking a contrary position in a particular
prosecution.  See Defendants' May 9, 1996 Response to the May 8, 1996 Order of
Court.  The letter also fails to mention how users who participate in chat
rooms, newsgroups, listservs, and e-mail might take advantage of &#167;
223(e)(5)(A).  Finally, it is undisputed that neither PICS nor the hypothetical
&quot;-L18&quot; tag are available to speakers using the World Wide Web today,
whom the Government has explicitly reserved its right to prosecute should the
CDA ultimately be found constitutional.  See Stipulation and Order of February
26, 1996, quoted supra.</P>
<P>(21)Turner examined certain &quot;must-carry&quot; provisions under an
intermediate scrutiny, since those laws imposed incidental burdens on speech but
did not directly regulate content.  Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2469.  The Court
remanded the case to the district court without passing on the constitutionality
of the must-carry provisions.  Id. at 2472.</P>
<P>(22)Arguably, a valid CDA would create an incentive for overseas
pornographers not to label their speech. If we upheld the CDA, foreign
pornographers could reap the benefit of unfettered access to American audiences.
 A valid CDA might also encourage American pornographers to relocate in foreign
countries or at least use anonymous remailers from foreign servers.</P>

<p>Welcome to the ACJNet Multiculturalism mailing list, created by the
Multiculturalism Program of the Department of Canadian Heritage, with
the assistance of Joey Giovanniello, ACJ<I>Net</I> Facilitator.  It

and project initiatives, and sharing experiences pertinent to our living
harmoniously in a diverse society -- a multicultural society:
immigration needs and services, combating racism and racial
discrimination, cultural diversification, cross-cultural training,
youth, seniors, family issues, etc.

<H2>What is the Legal Information Institute?</H2>
<P>The Legal Information Institute at the Cornell Law School (or LII) was established in July 1992 by Peter Martin and Tom Bruce.  The Insitute aims to explore new ways of distributing legal documents and commentary.  Like the law journals published at th
e school the LII draws upon faculty, staff, and student resources.  However, its publications all take an electronic form.  The LII's two primary activities -- the distribution of course supplements on disk in a hypertextual format, and the dissemination 
of legal information via the Internet -- have led to a variety of related activities all having to do with computer-based dissemination of or communcation about law.
<P>Critical start-up support for the Institute was furnished by the <a  href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.vill.edu/ncair/ncair.html">National Center for 
Automated Information Research</A> and <a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/admit/admit.htm">Cornell Law 
School</A>.  Both continue to support the Institute.  They have been joined by a growing number of corporate 
sponsors.  Sponsors of the LII's work during 1995-96 include: <UL>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; REVIEW of a decision of the Court of Appeals.
<i>Affirmed.</i><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JANINE P. GESKE, J.&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew Verdoljak
(Verdoljak) petitioned this court for review of a decision of the court of
appeals affirming the order of the Circuit Court for Douglas County dismissing
his negligence action against Mosinee Paper Corporation (Mosinee).  The order
was entered by Judge Joseph A. McDonald upon granting the defendant's motion
for summary judgment on the grounds that the claim was barred under the
"recreational use" statute, Wis. Stat. &#167; 895.52<a href="#fn0">[1]</a><b>Recreational activities; limitation of property owners'
liability.</b>  (1) Definitions. In this section:<p>
. . . .<p>
(g) "Recreational activity" means any outdoor activity undertaken for the
purpose of exercise, relaxation or pleasure, including practice or instruction
in any such activity.  "Recreational activity" includes, but is not limited to,
hunting, fishing, trapping, camping, picnicking, exploring caves, nature study,
bicycling, horseback riding, bird-watching, motorcycling . . . .<p>
. . . .<p>
(2) <b>No duty; immunity from liability</b>. (a) Except as provided in subs.
(3) to (6), no owner and no officer, employe or agent of an owner owes to any
person who enters the owner's property to engage in recreational activity:<p>
1. A duty to keep the property safe for recreational activities.<p>
. . . .<p>
3. A duty to give warning of an unsafe condition, use or activity on the
property.<p>
(b) Except as provided in subs. (3) to (6), no owner and no officer, employe or
agent of an owner is liable for any injury to, or any injury caused by, a
person engaging in a recreational activity on the owner's property or for any
injury resulting from an attack by a wild animal. which "limits a property
owner's liability for an injury to, or caused by, someone engaging in a
recreational activity on the owner's property."  <u>Sievert v. American Family
Mut. Ins. Co.</u>, 190 Wis. 2d 623, 626, 528 N.W.2d 413 (1995).  We granted the
petition for review to resolve the issue of whether &#167; 895.52 was properly
applied to immunize Mosinee from liability for injuries Verdoljak sustained
while riding his motorbike on a logging road owned by Mosinee.  We conclude
that the recreational use statute does not require an owner to "open" his or
her lands in order to be afforded immunity from liability to a person injured
while engaging in recreational activity on the owner's property.  We affirm the
decision of the court of appeals and hold that the recreational use statute
does apply to owners like Mosinee, even when they place some restrictions on
the public's use of their lands.<p>
FACTS<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The material facts are undisputed.  On July 27, 1992,
Verdoljak transported his Honda 125 "dirt bike" by truck to a location where he
intended to meet friends to go riding "for fun."  Upon arriving and not finding
his friends, Verdoljak unloaded his motorbike and went riding alone at a nearby
sand pit.  After a short time, he decided to try to meet up with his friends
and headed back along a dirt or sandy trail through a forested area.
Verdoljak had used the logging trail before and viewed it as a "short-cut" to
the area where he intended to meet his friends.  He was injured when he drove
into a gate blocking the road which consisted of a one-half-inch steel rod
suspended by chains hung from posts on either side of the trail. <p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mosinee owns the section of forest where the accident
occurred.  Several trails or logging roads wind through the property to provide
Mosinee's logging trucks and equipment access to the forest land during harvest
season.  For the protection of the property, the public, loggers and logging
equipment, the gate is closed during active harvesting operations to block
access by private vehicles or individuals.  However, when logging is not in
progress, the property is open to the public for hunting and fishing<a href="#fn1">[2]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mosinee contends that the concept that
owners can limit the types of recreation allowed on their land and yet still
benefit both the public and themselves by "opening" the land to public access
is not only contemplated by the above statute (which enumerates only specific
activities) but is explicitly permitted under Wis. Admin. Code &#167; NR
46.21(3)(b), which provides that:<p>
Open areas may be posted in conformance with this section and s. 943.13,
Stats., against uses other than hunting, fishing, hiking, sight-seeing and
cross-country skiing as long as the post signs indicate the land is managed
forest land and the land is open to the public for hunting, fishing, hiking,
sight-seeing and cross-country skiing.<p>
 and permits could be obtained to gather firewood.  There were no "no
trespassing" signs posted.  Nor were there signs prohibiting motorbike use on
the trail or specifically designating the trail for such use. <p>
RECREATIONAL USE IMMUNITY<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We review a grant of summary judgment by applying the same
standards used by the circuit court in making its initial determination--those
set forth in Wis. Stat. &#167; 802.08(2).  <u>Shannon v. Shannon</u>, 150 Wis.
2d 434, 441, 442 N.W.2d 25 (1989).  Summary judgment is appropriate where there
is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.  <u>Linville v. City of Janesville</u>, 184 Wis.
2d 705, 714, 516 N.W.2d 427 (1994).  Resolution of this case requires us to
apply the recreational use statute to the undisputed facts which presents a
question of law requiring de novo review.  <u>Sievert</u>, 190 Wis. 2d at
628.<p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Verdoljak argues that Mosinee is not entitled to invoke
the protection of the recreational use statute in this case because Mosinee had
not "opened" its property for the particular recreational use of motorbiking at
the particular time of the accident.  He asserts that the legislative history
and the decisions of Wisconsin courts have made it clear that a private
landowner is only afforded immunity for lands "opened" to public use.  He
argues further that Mosinee cannot claim the benefit of having "opened" its
lands for recreational use because it took "affirmative steps to expressly
forbid" the use of motorbikes on the property.<a href="#fn2">[3]</a>  Under
Verdoljak's theory, landowners should permit the public full access to their
land for all recreational uses because any restrictions would expose an owner
to liability.  In short, he contends that landowners must open all of their
land, to all recreational uses, at all times, in order to benefit from full
protection of the recreational use statute.<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We reject this argument.  Rather, we concur with the
position taken by the court of appeals which found that the meaning of Wis.
Stat. &#167;&nbsp;895.52 is "straightforward and plain: It limits 'the
liability of property owners toward others who use the property for
recreational activities'; it does not purport to condition that limit to owners
<i>who open their land</i> to those who use it for recreational activities."
<u>Verdoljak v. Mosinee Paper Corp.</u>, 192 Wis.&nbsp;2d 235, 246, 531 N.W.2d
341 (Ct. App. 1995).  There are large sections of land in Wisconsin on which a
member of the public will be greeted by neither a "Welcome" nor a "No
Trespassing" sign.  Under Wis. Stat. &#167;&nbsp;895.52(2) the owner of the
property is clearly, unambiguously immune from liability for injury suffered or
caused by a person engaging in recreational activity on the property.  The
focus is on the activity of the person who enters and uses the land, not upon
any obligation on the part of the owner to affirmatively demonstrate that the
land is open.<a href="#fn3">[4]</a><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As in all instances when our inquiry centers on a statute,
our primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the
legislature.  <u>State v. Olson</u>, 175 Wis. 2d 628, 633, 498 N.W.2d 661
(1993).  Here, the legislature has provided us with a clear statement of intent
contained in the introductory language to 1983 Wisconsin Act 418 which created
Wis. Stat. &#167; 895.52:<p>
 <b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Legislative intent. </b>The legislature intends by
this act to limit the liability of property owners toward others who use their
property for recreational activities under circumstances in which the owner
does not derive more than a minimal pecuniary benefit.  While it is not
possible to specify in a statute every activity which might constitute a
recreational activity, this act provides examples of the kinds of activities
that are meant to be included, and the legislature intends that, where
substantially similar circumstances or activities exist, this legislation
should be liberally construed in favor of property owners to protect them from
liability. <p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neither the statement of legislative intent nor the
language of Wis. Stat. &#167; 895.52 contains the word "open."  This stands in
contrast with the introductory language of 1963 Wis. Act 89 which created the
predecessor immunity statute, Wis. Stat. &#167; 29.68<a href="#fn4">[5]</a><b>29.68  Liability of landowners.</b> <p>
(2) <i>Permission.</i>  An owner, lessee or occupant of premises who gives
permission to another to hunt, fish, trap, camp, hike, sightsee, berry pick or
to proceed with water sports or recreational uses upon such premises does not
thereby extend any assurance that the premises are safe for such purpose, or
constitute the person to whom permission is granted an invitee to whom a duty
of care is owed, or assume responsibility for or incur liability for any injury
to person or property caused by any act of persons to whom the permission is
granted, . . ., describing it as "relating to the limitations on liability of
landowners who open private lands for recreational purposes."  However, this
introductory language was altered three times prior to the creation of &#167;
895.52 in subsequent amendments, none mentioning an obligation to "open" land
but rather referring to: "a landowner who gives another permission to use his
land for a recreational purpose" (1965 Wis. Act 190); "landowners who permit
people to cut or remove wood from their land" (1977 Wis. Act 75); and finally
"landowners who allow their land to be used for certain outdoor recreational
activities" (1977 Wis. Act 123).<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have found that the nature and language of amendments
are significant and that the omission of a word or phrase is indicative of an
intent to alter statutory meaning.  <u>Cardinal v. Leader Nat. Ins. Co.</u>,
166 Wis. 2d 375, 388, 480 N.W.2d 1 (1992).  Further, where a statute has been
repealed and recreated on the same subject, any changes in language are
presumed to be the result of conscious deliberation on the part of the
legislature.  <u>Kerkvliet v. Kerkvliet</u>, 166 Wis. 2d 930, 945-46, 480
N.W.2d 823 (Ct. App. 1992).  Here, the newly created statute is essentially a
complete rewrite, containing none of the previous references to "open[ing]
land" and giving or granting "permission" to enter.  Again, the legislature has
provided clear guidance in its statement of its intent as to the focus of the
current statute as contrasted with its predecessor: "[1983 Wis. Act 418] is
intended to overrule any previous Wisconsin supreme court decisions
interpreting section 29.68 of the statutes if the decision is more restrictive
than or inconsistent with the provisions of this act."<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The unambiguous language of the recreational use statute
sets the following precondition for immunity--that the injury be to or caused
by "a person engaging in a recreational activity on the owner's property . . ."
Wis. Stat. &#167;&nbsp;895.52(2)(b).  There is no language that conditions
immunity upon affirmative acts on the part of the owner to grant permission or
otherwise "open" land.<a href="#fn5">[6]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the courts
of Wisconsin have used it, the concept of "openness" relates to public policy
and legislative purpose--it has never been and is not now, as this opinion
clarifies, an "element" of the statute that a landowner needs to satisfy in
order to be afforded immunity.  The legislature has made it clear that previous
decisions by Wisconsin courts that are more restrictive, implying a requirement
that lands be "open," are overruled.<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We must presume that the legislature intends for a statute
to be interpreted in a manner that advances the purposes of the statute.
<u>GTE North Inc. v. Public Service Comm.</u>, 176 Wis. 2d 559, 566, 500 N.W.2d
284 (1993).  This court and the court of appeals have recognized that the
purpose of the recreational immunity statute is to encourage property owners to
allow use of their lands for recreational activities by removing the potential
for liability arising out of negligence actions brought against them by persons
who use the land for such recreational purposes.  <u>See, e.g.</u>,
<u>Linville</u>, 184 Wis. 2d at 715; <u>Silingo v. Village of Mukwonago</u>,
156 Wis. 2d 536, 544, 458 N.W.2d 379 (Ct. App. 1990); <u>Bystery v. Village of
Sauk City</u>, 146 Wis. 2d 247, 252, 430 N.W.2d 611 (Ct. App. 1988).  This
purpose would be defeated if Verdoljak's interpretation were adopted because
property owners would lose the certainty that a true immunity statute like
&#167; 895.52 provides.  Owners would be encouraged to close all of their lands
to all purposes if they feared that a partial restriction covering particular
activities would actually expose them to greater, rather than lesser,
liability.<a href="#fn6">[7]</a>  Public policy is well-served by the current
statute under which landowners are encouraged to allow public access to their
property and those who take advantage of this access by recreating cannot sue
for ordinary negligence.<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to Verdoljak, each case is fact-governed and
immunity should only apply to injuries sustained in recreational activities
that are specifically permitted on a given property.  In investigating this
line of thought, the following hypothetical was posed during oral argument:
Farmer A allows public access to a lake on his property for public swimming,
but posts a sign prohibiting skateboarding on a hilly area next to the lake.
Verdoljak stated that, under his interpretation, the statute would immunize the
property owner from suit by an injured swimmer but not by a skateboarder.  <p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adherence to the canons of statutory construction as well
as common sense require us to reject this argument.  We will not adopt an
interpretation that would lead to an absurd or unreasonable result.
<u>Cardinal</u>, 166 Wis. 2d at 390.  The above scenario does present just such
an absurd result.  This line of questioning in oral argument also raised the
issue of whether, if Verdoljak were determined to have been trespassing at the
time and point of his accident, Mosinee would be barred from claiming statutory
immunity.  We take this opportunity to state that the applicability of Wis.
Stat. &#167; 895.52 does not hinge on the injured party's status as a
non-trespasser, but rather on his or her use of the property for recreational
purposes.  We reject the notion that the recreational use statute could confer
greater protection to a trespasser than to one who was lawfully using the
premises and, conversely, that it could expose a property owner to greater
liability to one engaging in prohibited activity than to members of the public
utilizing the property as intended.  Again, we avoid constructions of a statute
that lead to absurd results.  <p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although our decision today is based on interpretation of
Wisconsin's recreational use statute which predates that of many other
jurisdictions<a href="#fn7">[8]</a>, we note that our holding is in conformance
with that reached by many other state and federal courts faced with similar
scenarios.  For example, in <u>Holden v. Schwer</u>, 495 N.W.2d 269 (Neb.
1993), the Supreme Court of Nebraska concluded that the state's Recreation
Liability Act immunized a farmer, who allowed the public to use his property
with permission, from suit by a plaintiff who was injured when she drove a
three-wheeled vehicle into a barbed wire fence.  The court commented that "[i]t
would not encourage landowners to allow others to use their property if, to
come under the protection of the act, they had to allow any person, at any
time, under any circumstances, to come onto their property and use it in any
manner that person saw fit."  <u>Holden</u>, 495 N.W.2d at 273.<a href="#fn8">[9]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our decision follows the legislative directive contained
in 1983 Wis. Act 418 that the recreational use statute "should be liberally
construed in favor of the property owners to protect them from liability."
<u>See also</u> <u>Linville</u>, 184 Wis. 2d at 715.  In keeping with that
directive, and to give effect to the intent of the legislature, we conclude
that under Wisconsin's recreational use statute, &#167; 895.52(2)(a), Mosinee
owed no duty to Verdoljak who had entered the property to engage in a
recreational activity and, therefore, Mosinee is not liable for the injury
incurred by Verdoljak while engaging in that activity.  Thus, we affirm the
decision of the court of appeals.<p>

appeals is affirmed.<p>

by <i>Mark A. Siefert</i>.<p>
<hr><!-- Footnotes --><a name="fn0">[1]</a>  Wis. Stat. &#167; 895.52 provides in
relevant part:<p>
<a name="fn1">[2]</a>  Mosinee allows hunting and fishing on its land under the
dictates of Wis. Stat. &#167; 77.83(2), which requires that, in order to
qualify for certain property tax incentives, an owner of "managed forest land
shall permit public access to the land for hunting, fishing, hiking,
sight-seeing and cross-country skiing."  <p>
<a name="fn2">[3]</a>  During oral argument, the only conduct that Verdoljak
could point to as "expressly forbidding" motorbiking was the placement of the
gate across the road.<p>
<a name="fn3">[4]</a>  This is not to say that there are no circumstances under
which a landowner may be held liable to a person injured while recreating on
his or her property.  Wisconsin Statute &#167;&nbsp;895.52 expressly provides
that liability is not limited if: (a) the private property owner collects
money, goods or services in excess of $2,000 per annum in payment for use of
the property for recreational activity; or if the injury is: (b) caused by a
malicious failure of the owner, his or her employe or agent to warn of a known,
unsafe condition; (c) caused by a malicious act by the owner, his or her
employe or agent; (d) to a social guest expressly and individually invited by
the owner for the specific occasion; or (e) to an employe acting in the scope
of his or her duties.  <u>See</u> Wis. Stat. &#167;&nbsp;895.52(6).<p>
<a name="fn4">[5]</a>  The now repealed statute read, in relevant part:<p>
<a name="fn5">[6]</a>  Even following the passage of Wis. Stat.
&#167;&nbsp;895.52, both this court and the court of appeals have frequently
commented that the underlying purpose of the statute is to expand opportunities
for recreation through encouraging landowners to open their lands without fear
of liability to those who enter to engage in recreational activities.  <u>See,
e.g.</u>, <u>Linville v. City of Janesville</u>, 184 Wis.&nbsp;2d 705, 715, 516
N.W.2d 427 (1994) ("The policy behind the statute is to encourage property
owners to open their lands for recreational activities by removing a property
user's potential cause of action against a property owner's alleged
negligence.").  <u>See also</u> <u>Szarzynski v. YMCA, Camp Minikani</u>, 184
Wis.&nbsp;2d 875, 888, 517 N.W.2d 135 (1994); <u>Crowbridge v. Village of Egg
Harbor</u>, 179 Wis.&nbsp;2d 565, 572, 508 N.W.2d 15 (Ct. App. 1993); <u>Mooney
v. Royal Ins. Co.</u>, 164 Wis.&nbsp;2d 516, 522-23, 476 N.W.2d 287 (Ct. App.
1991); <u>Nelson v. Schreiner</u>, 161 Wis.&nbsp;2d 798, 802, 469 N.W.2d 214
(Ct. App. 1991); <u>Ervin v. City of Kenosha</u>, 159 Wis.&nbsp;2d 464, 477,
464 N.W.2d 654 (1991); <u>Kruschke v. City of New Richmond</u>, 157
Wis.&nbsp;2d 167, 173, 458 N.W.2d 832 (Ct. App. 1990); <u>Silingo v. Village of
Mukwonago</u>, 156 Wis.&nbsp;2d 536, 544, 458 N.W.2d 379 (Ct. App. 1990);
<u>Bystery v. Village of Sauk City</u>, 146 Wis.&nbsp;2d 247, 252, 430 N.W.2d
611 (Ct. App. 1988).<p>
<a name="fn6">[7]</a>  The inherent irony if such an interpretation were
adopted is illustrated by Mosinee's situation where the company restricted
access to that area of the forest during harvesting operations, at least in
part, due to its concerns for safety.<p>
<a name="fn7">[8]</a>  The original Wisconsin recreational use statute, Wis.
Stat. &#167;&nbsp;29.68, enacted in 1963 was one of the earliest in the
country, predating the model act developed by the Council of State Governments
in 1965 which forms the basis for the statutes subsequently adopted in many
states.  <u>See</u> <u>LePoidevin v. Wilson</u>, 111 Wis. 2d 116, 131 n.8, 330
N.W.2d 555 (1983).<p>
<a name="fn8">[9]</a>  <u>See also</u> <u>Hubbard v. Brown</u>, 785 P.2d 1183
(Cal. 1990) (affirming that holder of federal grazing permit immunized from
suit by motorcyclist who collided with barbed wire gate under California code
which makes "recreational users responsible for their own safety and
eliminat[es] the financial risk that had kept land closed"); <u>Sega v. State
of New York</u>, 456 N.E.2d 1174, 1175 (N.Y. 1983) (finding operator of
all-terrain vehicle who drove into cable blocking roadway in no-fee State park
barred from suing State under statute immunizing landowners who "gratuitously
allow persons to use their property for certain enumerated recreational
activities").

<P><STRONG>I-NES is Windows based software that provides digital audio and text editing on a standard desktop computer. </STRONG>Wire capture, network audio capture, local audio recording and all other radio newsroom functions are provided by I-NES workstations. I-NES users read newscasts and play audio clips directly from the PC.  Paper scripts and taped audio are not required with I-NES. 
</P>
<P>Workstations are linked through a Local Area Network (LAN). I-NES uses off-the-shelf computers, sound cards and network software. There is no proprietary hardware required, making the workstations compatible with virtually any other Windows software. I-NES users provide their own equipment for the system and are also responsible for having the system installed, including the network. BN can supply precise requirements and recommendations for your hardware. We'll provide
drawings and advice on how to design your LAN.</P> 
<P>For radio stations in Canada, $3,000 provides software for one frontend and one workstation. There is an additional charge of $250 for each additional workstation. There are I-NES systems located in stations
across Canada. Contact BN for a list of current users. BN can arrange a tour of an operational site.</P>

<H2>Core Course Documents in Disk-Based Hypertext from the LII</H2>
<P>Since 1993 the Legal Information Institute, Cornell Law School, has published electronic editions of core materials for important law school courses.  For the 96-97 academic year, the LII offers the following disk-based materials, in multiple formats.  All can be purchased and downloaded from the LII's secure server.
<P>As in years past these titles have been prepared in Folio Views format.  They are available together with a version of Folio's hypertext and full-text search software for MS-Windows that will allow annotation, highlighting, and bookmarks (Folio VIP 3.01).  Since U.S. law students and law faculty already have or have ready access to full featured versions of Folio software from LEXIS-NEXIS as part of the "office" suite of software, we are also offering the "infobase" files without software.  And for those who simply want to pull this material into a word-processing environment to print or to cut and paste portions into notes, we are offering ".rtf" word-processing files.  We had hoped to be able to offer versions in the PREMISE format of the West Publishing Company.  Unfortunately, West has not yet agreed to our distributing PREMISE books on comparable terms.
<P>The LII's Folio Infobase web server allows you to explore the content and a portion of the functionality of the hypertext version of these publications across the Net.  Bear in mind, though, that what you can see and do across the Net is less than what is possible at an individual workstation or local area network.

It designs and manufactures Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) systems, surge suppressors, and accompanying software which provide pure power to computers, engineering work stations, phone systems, file servers and internet equipment.  The typical UPS will signal when there's been a problem with the power line and its battery backup will then allow ample time to exit from applications gracefully.</TD><TD ALIGN=top VALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=270><P><B>WHY</B><HR><BR>A study by IBM has showed that a typical computer is subject to more than 120 power problems per month. The effects of power problems range from the subtle keyboard lockups, hardware degradation to the dramatic complete data loss or burnt motherboards.   APC has helped create a network power protection  for those who have recognized the need for power protection and taken proactive steps to ensure that they're prepared for the inevitable.</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=TOP VALIGN=LEFT><B>Products</B><BR>Product lines include:Smart UPS&reg;, line interactive UPS systems; Back-UPS&reg;, cost-effective family of UPS protection; Pro&reg; performance protection for advanced workstations; Martix UPS&reg; midrange modular UPS protection; Surge Arrest&reg; high performance surge suppressors; PowerManager&reg; control console; Line-R&reg; high performance power conditioners; PowerChute&reg; network power management software; PowerNet&reg; SNMP Adapter&reg; and software.</TD><TD ALIGN=TOP VALIGN=RIGHT><P><B>Customers</B><BR>The Company sells primarily through the computer distribution channel.

We are a computer solutions shop competing in Southern California
full time since 1992!<BR>
We fix things, reconfigure things, and make things the way they
ought to be. Since 1982 we have consulted to companies in the
Orange County Area to solve computer problems, or accomplish what
could not be accomplished using typical store-bought solutions.
<BR>
Brett Mason has been a systems engineer working with several large
computer resellers in Southern California. He is known for rock-solid
Novell NetWare solutions. Brett has been a CNE since 1990 when
he led a team of engineers to revamp L.A. Gear's network. He designed
and implemented the network for the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Laguna
Niguel, Epson's customer service network, and over 450 others.

<LI>One area of pride for us is our relationships. We have strategic
alliances with several specialty firms, each outstanding in its
own right.
<LI><a href="http://www.mcbinch.com/cgi-bin/mcbinch/nph-mcb?url=http://www.mbsnet.com">Ministry Business Services</A>,
a Novell Platinum Partner led by Nick Nicholaou, is a management
consulting firm whose specialty is enabling ministries and church
organizations to leverage resources to best accomplish their goals.
Not only does MBS provide full accounting and auditing services,
they also understand how technological resources, interpersonal
skills, business strategies and management techniques work together
to further enhance ministry. Brett Mason Computing has assisted
MBS in several situations where advanced computer implementations
were provided as a significant portion of an MBS ministry solution.
<LI>David L. Primrose and Associates, of Irvine, CA. is built
on the theme from &quot;The Little Engine That Could&quot;. In
earlier days, Dave and Brett were often found in the dark recesses
of L.A. Gear, designing a whole new network which would take them
from 250 computers to over 900. Often I heard the quiet but determined
voices in the background... &quot;I think I can, I think I can...&quot;,
and indeed we could, and did! Dave Primrose is still known for
providing new answers to questions just as they are being asked!
Today he proves to be both an excellent hardware resource and
a diligent, capable engineer. If you're looking for depth with
MicroSoft products, here's your best shot!

<LI>What do we do?<BR>
We usually get called when something is not working right, or
answers are not forthcoming from current vendors. We will go onsite,
isolate the problem, and present a solution.<BR>
Soon after, we become involved in a broader project which is not
going right, or has some errant side, and which needs to be brought
into compliance with a larger plan.<BR>
Then we get to the point where our client wants to make sure that
their long term business plans are supported by their long term
technology strategy. Often this has not been addressed previously.
<LI>What can we do for you?<BR>
We want your computer systems to match your business strategy.
You know your business well, and you've acquired computers and
peripherals to fill the need for proposals, letters, data tracking,
accounting, and other stuff. We can solve small problems, and
HUGE ONES too! We can link all your computers together, whether
PC's, MAC's, SUN's, Mini's or Mainframe's, and instruct your users
so they are best equipped to use their tools.<BR>
We can help you plan a strategy so your computer systems will
solve the exact problems required for you to deliver your business's
services and goods.
<LI>What don't we do, for anybody?<BR>
We don't... pirate software, deliver misplaced solutions, agree
to short term cheap solutions for long term needs, twist out other
vendors, or argue with clients...
<LI>What can you expect from us?<BR>
A timely response to your calls, A quick response to network failures,
Excellence and Expertise, Comprehensive solutions, not band-aid
fixes, The best network service available in Southern California...

<HR WIDTH="100%">Justice Against Crime is an organization that is dedicated
to bringing judicial reform as it applies to all. We take one point and
push for its endorsement into the system. We find laws that pertain to
the safety of the citizens and request that they be enforced. We are now
working on completing the necessary requirements to make AB 195 a meaningful
insertion that forces those within the system to abide by the laws written.
One, must at all times, believes that &quot;Timely retribution is Truly
Justice Against Crime.&quot; Without it, the laws of this country are paper
Tigers. The population believes the law applies to others, not them. We
have to create, once again, that the laws are written to be obeyed. If
you don't intend to enforce the Laws, don't write them. No bill, created
by our legislators, should be written without sanction if not complied
with. Remember Judges have to obey the law also. We accept no cash just
support when it comes time to vote in the legislature and at the ballet
at election time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<DT>FOOD FOR THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR ACTION OR INACTION.</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>Extracted from the Ann Landers Column about four people named Everybody,
Somebody, Anybody and Nobody.</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>&quot;There was an important job to be done and Everybody was sure
that Somebody would do it.&nbsp; Anybody could have done it but Nobody
did it.&nbsp; Somebody got very angry about that because it was Everybody's
job.&nbsp; Everybody thought Anybody could do it,&nbsp; but Nobody realized
that Everybody wouldn't do it.&nbsp; It ended up that Everybody blamed
Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody could have done.&quot;&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>Is this the definition of rationization?&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to realize
that to blame somebody for something that nobody did because it was Everybody's
job that Anybody could do is not facing reality.&nbsp; All it takes is
one body to make change to save people from being a willful homicide victim.&nbsp;
Are you willing to help?&nbsp; It is apparent that our Politicians and
Judges won't.&nbsp; They are apparently at ease with the present 3530&nbsp;
murders committed each year.&nbsp; I am not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>People try to throw the emotional effect of the punishment in front
of the message sent by executions.&nbsp; The emotion issue is on a scale
of 1 to 100.&nbsp; The message is just one thing.&nbsp; If you do the crime
what society does slows down murders or escalates them. With just the execution
of 4, here in California,&nbsp; willful homicides have dropped from 4095
to 3530 per year.&nbsp; That is a savings of an average of 565 victims
per year from being a murderer's thrill in the past 3 years.&nbsp; Those
that appose the death penalty would rather save 4 murderers from being
executed than saving 565 people from a violent death each of the past 3
years committed by the people they are trying to save.&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>&nbsp; <FONT SIZE=+2>Write your representatives and ask their views
on executions.</FONT></DT>

<DT>&nbsp;And then tell them yours.&nbsp; It is important to get involved
if we are to change this society so the we</DT>

<DT>have no fear to send our child to the store for a bottle of milk and
expect their safe return.</DT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>1.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B>My son and two other men were murdered August 6, 1996, in Wabash
County,&nbsp; Indiana.&nbsp; Their murderer is awaiting trial.&nbsp; Our
local prosecutor says&nbsp; the death penalty is too expensive and requires
too much work on his&nbsp; part.&nbsp; The murderer was employed by General
Motors in Marion, INdiana, as&nbsp; a drug and alcohol rehab counselor.&nbsp;
He tested .23 blood alcohol and had&nbsp; a large amount of prescription
and non-prescription drugs in his system&nbsp; when he murdered my son.&nbsp;
My son, Bill, was the fourth man shot (one&nbsp; lives, but is paralyzed
from the waist down), as Bill was responding to&nbsp; the 911 call for
a minor personal injury accident.&nbsp; Bill was acting in&nbsp; the capacity
of a certified volunteer firefighter.&nbsp; He would have been 19&nbsp;
on October 26.&nbsp; He had a full-ride scholarship to college, had just&nbsp;
graduated from high school in May 96.&nbsp; Two eyewitnesses saw the murders.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The murderer tried to flee the scene, wrecked his truck, was apprehended&nbsp;
at the scene, only moments after the shootings.&nbsp; My son wasn't found&nbsp;
until over an hour later, because he had been shot in his Bronco, before&nbsp;
he could even get out to help, and the truck sped off the road several&nbsp;

to&nbsp; announce his decision about the charges early in January.&nbsp;
A trial date&nbsp; is set for July 7.&nbsp; Please help me fight this battle!&nbsp;
If he does not&nbsp; seek the death penalty, I am told that there will
be no trial, only a&nbsp; plea bargain for life without parole.&nbsp; I

<P><B>The law abiding citizens just put their trust in the law makers many
years ago and assumed they were doing the best thing for all of us and
before we new it crime was on the rise and not much was getting done to
stop it.&nbsp; Suddenly it was against the law for a criminal to even be
in a crowded cell.&nbsp; You know the scenario. Even if we abolished the
death penalty again if prisoners had to suffer a little for their crimes
if would more acceptable than what we have now.&nbsp; By suffer I do not
mean at the hands of animal type guards.&nbsp; But chain gangs, hard work,
no parole, no appeal after appeal, just something to drive home the magnitude
of their crime and the reason they are behind bars.&nbsp; The fact that
they are confined to a 4X10 cell 24 hours a day is simply not enough.&nbsp;
In almost any other country criminals are locked up and the key is lost.&nbsp;
I don't think I have ever heard that their prisons are over crowded.&nbsp;
In some countries if you steal you hand is cut off.&nbsp; The punishment
some how fits the crime.&nbsp; I bet the criminal thinks twice before stealing
again and risking his other hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>So I don't know if the thought of taking the law to the people that
are being hurt the most is so out of the question.&nbsp; Of course then
we would have some do- gooder that would take it to far and ruin the whole
concept.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>I guess I am a bit touchy right now.&nbsp; We just got a date set
for the murderer of my daughter.&nbsp; April 2.&nbsp; The D.A. says it
is a 50-50 chance it will be a good one.&nbsp; The Attorney General's office
in Austin was a little more optimistic.&nbsp; I just finished reading the
last Petition for Writ of Certiorari just filed.&nbsp; The question presented
is:&nbsp; &quot;Whether Herman's sixth and fourteenth amendment rights
were violated because the trial court limited defense counsel's voir dire
questioning of eight prospective jurors.&quot;&nbsp; Can you believe this?&nbsp;
I am sure he had no idea what the sixth and fourteenth amendments were
until he does not want to die for murdering my daughter.&nbsp; WHAT ABOUT
ALL OF HER RIGHT THAT WERE VIOLATED.&nbsp; I just want to ask him that
so badly.&nbsp; This is not the first time thay have filed a petition just
having to do with what was allowed during voir dire.&nbsp; They just change
the names of the prospective jurors.&nbsp; I get so d--- mad everytime
I read these reports.&nbsp; He confessed, he led the police to where he
buried the gun.&nbsp; He is guilty.&nbsp; We did not even need an jury
to determine that. So why are we concerned with what questions were allowed
the jurors. Do you want to know what questions it was they wanted to ask?&nbsp;
Probably not but I will tell you anyway.&nbsp; The question had to do with
mitigating evidence. The defense continually ask each juror &quot;what
standard of proof they would favor in considering mitigating evidence.&quot;&nbsp;
Herman challenges the trial court's refusal to allow defense counsel to
ask eight prospective jurors what burden of proof they would favor regarding
mitigation evidence. He claims that this restriction impaired the intelligent
exercise of his peremptory challenges, thereby denying him due process
and the effective assistance of counsel.&nbsp; This time it was eight jurors
I don't remember how many it was the last time, but the question was the
same.&nbsp; Each time taking a year to make its way through the system.&nbsp;
Seems to me time could have been better spent.</B></P>

<P><B>His dad was a marine and he was strict, sometimes talking to him
four hours at a time and sometimes thumping him on the head with his marine
corp ring. This inhumane treatment in an otherwise upper middle class,
private school upbringing begat a cold blooded murderer.&nbsp; Go figure!!</B></P>

<P><B>So part of me is ready for an eye for an eye.&nbsp; I do not think
the justice system cares how the victim really feels.&nbsp; The media forgets
us as soon as the sensationalism of the crime is over.&nbsp; How the victim
is doing does not sell newspapers.&nbsp; The defense attorneys would become
street people without all the appeals so they certainly don't want an eye
for an eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>So George, can we make a difference in our life time.&nbsp; I would
like to think so and I don't mind trying but when I see and feel this injustice
with my own eyes and heart I just sink in dispair.</B></P>

<P><B>Sorry for rambling, but I feel better.&nbsp; Talk about justice,
this was not very fair to you.</B></P>

<P><B>I will let you know if I get to go to Huntsville in April.</B></P>

<P>News flash 9/29/96</P>

<P>AB 195&nbsp; only applies to those that receive a death sentence after
1 January 1997. Senator Bill Lockyer pulled a political power play by not
allowing SB 1533 to come out of committee the night of 31 August so the
bill died. If this had been allowed to get to the Senate floor it would
have passed. With SB 1533 and AB 2008 it would have addressed those on
death row now. So you can thank Senator Lockyer for denying those on death
row of having there records of trial certified so their appeal of the sentence
of death can commence. Without certification they just sit on death row
waiting on the Judicial to do &quot;something&quot;. Is this criminal in
denying the appeal process. Does the 14th amendment of our constitution
apply here? Is this failure of due process?</P>

<P>&nbsp;The Governor of California signed AB 195 and vetoed AB2008. AB
195 only deals with those that receive the death penalty after 1/1/97.
All of those on death row now are under the old rules of catch me if you
can allowed by Senator Bill Lockyer of Hayward, California action. All
of you in that area take note and when it comes election time we will be
here to remind you that Lockyer is anti death penalty by action.</P>

a clone in Patrick Lehner. He also believes that it is best to deny the
execution of murderers so a message can be sent &quot;do your homicide
and we will be there to protect you from being executed by any tactic,
legal or illegal.&quot; The greatest illegal action is delaying the certification
of records of trial. The appeal can't commence until certification is completed
by the Judge of the trial. In essence, he and they are denying the accused
the right to appeal his sentence of death up to a period of Nine years.
In the case of Carter they have denied him the right to appeal his Los
Angeles Death Penalty for 6 years and 10 months and 5 years 2 months for
his death penalty from his San Diego trial. If Alex and Patrick were interested
in the rights of the accused, they would be fighting to see that they have
their appeal for an innocence verdict or down to a lesser charge. But no,
by their action they force him and the others to live amoung the most vicious

<P>Alex Bennett has place William Noguera, death row inmate,&nbsp; #D77200,&nbsp;
on his web page as an artist that needs your aid and comfort.&nbsp; He
is stating this man needs your help.&nbsp; I state that if the time spent
by Bennett in saving possible murder victims, by seeing that these murderers
are executed in the time frame specified by law,&nbsp; this world could
be a safer place.&nbsp;</P>

<P>I received this paragraph about Noguera from the Orange County District
Attorney who convicted Noguera.</P>

<P>&quot;The case of the People v. Noguera involved the brutal beating
and strangulation by the defendant of the victim who was murdered in her
own home.&nbsp; The victim's daughter was a co-defendant and the motive
for the murder was to collect insurance pproceeds resulting from the co-defendant
being a beneficiary.&nbsp; the date of the murder was April of 1983.&nbsp;
There was an extensive investigation by the La Habra Police Departement
that took six months resulting inthe arrest of both defendants in December
of 1983.&quot;</P>

<P>The California Department of Corrections, Condemned Inmate Report, states
that he,&nbsp; Noguera, has been on death row since the 4th of February
1988.&nbsp; We ask, why the time frame from the apprehension date to the
date of his arrival on death row, five years.&nbsp; History has informed
us that the best defense is delay.&nbsp; We ask,&nbsp; who caused the delay
of the trial procedure? We &quot;KNOW&quot;,&nbsp; by law,&nbsp; the prosecution
has to be ready in a set time or they have to turn him lose.&nbsp; We know
that he has been on death row nine years,&nbsp; waiting and waiting so
long that he has earned a college degree on death row.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P>On May 13 the United States Supreme Court handed down its decision in
United States v. Armstrong. In Armstrong, five black men facing federal
trial for dealing &quot;crack&quot; cocaine and weapons charges made a
pretrial motion claiming that the United States Attorney in Los Angeles
has been selecting &quot;crack&quot; dealers for prosecution by race. Although
the defendants presented no legitimate evidence to support their claim,
it was accepted by a federal district judge and later a panel of the federal
Ninth Circuit Court of appeals. Shortly after the district judges ruling
over 200 other defendants facing federal charges filed similar discrimination
claims against the United States Attorney's office. When the Supreme Court
agreed to review the matter, CJLF filed what the U.S. Attorney Nora Manella
called &quot;the finest brief in the case&quot;. The courts May 13th decision
overturned the lower court ruling, rejecting the discrimination claim and
established a much tougher standard of proof which will now have to be
met for acceptance of such claims in the federal courts. CJLF's reasoning
was apparent in Chief Justice Rehnquist's own opinion</P>

<BR>
</FONT></FONT></I></B>In reading the report of the California Supreme Court's
action, the 3 strike issue, this thought came to my mind. Does this action,
by the Supreme Court, relieve the judges from following any requirement
by the people or that of the Supreme Court as a matter of fact. Judges
must realize that they are the third party in a dispute that applies the
law as established by the &quot;people&quot;, not them. We are seeing more
judges violating established law under the guise of its constitutionality.
Judges have bent the constitution to where it doesn't resemble the original.
Here may I ask, if we went back to the original concept, of its creators,
would we be better off? Three strikes was a mandate by the people, of California,
to take habitual criminals off of the street before they became violent.
When I was a youngster the rule applied then that if you were convicted
of committing 3 felonies you had a permanent residence in prison. We knew
that the message didn't reach all but it did some and those that didn't
believe, they went to prison. We got rid of Rose bird because of her anti
&quot;the people&quot; feelings on the death penalty issue and now that
we have a new Chief Justice, of the California Supreme Court , does this
mean that we must establish a watch on him so when he comes up for re affirming
that he must go. &quot;The people&quot; affirmed 3 strikes by a 72 percent
margin. We don't want those offenders around us to protect all of our families.</P>

<P>We ask this question about this Supreme Court's action. Is this really
an attack on &quot;three strikes&quot; or at &quot;the people&quot; for
bypassing them, the three political bodies, legislative, executive and
judicial, in getting a law that protects the people from habitual criminals
on the books? I believe it is vindictive action. If you don't belive that
the courts can be vindictive take the law into your own hands and see how
quickly you get through the judicial process and locked up. As an example
look at that lady who shot the molester of her son and got sent up the
river 10 times faster that the court can just certify the record of trial
on death penalty cases.</P>

<P>Write to your representatives and express your view on this issue. It
is the only way you have of letting them know your views. Victims changed
bad laws before and we will continue in the future. Oh yes, write us and
tell us where you believe we are wrong also. This is important to us.&nbsp;<BR>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>Politicians Speaking</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P>Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and Senator Jon Kyle of Arizona
are proposing &quot;THE FEDERAL VICTIMS RIGHTS CONSTITUTION AMENDMENT.
The opportunity to be present at every proceeding in which those rights
are extended to the accused or convicted offender; to be heard at any proceeding
involving sentencing, including the right to object to a previously negotiated
plea, or a release from custody; to be informed of any release or escape;
and to a speedy trial, a final conclusion free from unreasonable delay,
full restitution from the convicted offender, reasonable measures to protect
the victim from violence or intimidation by the accused or convicted offender,
and notice of these victims rights.</P>

<P>Section 2. The several States, with respect to a proceeding in a State
forum, and the Congress with respect to a proceeding in a United States
forum, shall have the power to implement further the rights established
in this article by appropriate legislation.</P>

<P>This is a position in our lives that has never been addressed before.
As Far as the courts are concerned the victim is a nonidentity other than
a piece of evidence in the court of law. It is important for all who believe
in the rights of a victim, to be informed and be protected, to inform as
many people and organizations we can to help make this become part of our
Constitutional Rights. Request that we be heard. If or when we become of
victim of a violent act it is mandatory that we be heard not ignored.&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P>There are political committee chairmen that, for whatever the reason,
hold up or dump proposals because they personally are opposed to the issue.
Senator Marks dumped 10-20-Life because, from what I hear and read, he
had a personal dislike for Mike Reynolds the author of the bill. This bill
is the only true gun control bill ever submitted. It only punishes those
who misuse a firearm. It doesn't restrict legitimate desires of the people
to own firearms. It states that if you use a weapon in the commission of
a crime you get an additional 10 years. If the weapon goes off an additional
20 years.. If the bullet hits anyone you are in prison for life.&nbsp;</P>

<P>Senator Marks submitted a bill in the California Senate in trying to
dilute the &quot;3 strikes&quot; law that the people passed on a ballot
measure. It went down in defeat by a 19 to 14 vote. By this you can see
that the Democratic Senate, here in California, doesn't want to punish
habitual criminals and help make our streets safer by locking them up.
Attorney General Dan Lungren states that &quot;3 strikes&quot; has caused
California's crime index to drop. If you have a representative that you
think is against a person owning a weapon ask for his views on 10-20-Life.
Then E-Mail it to us.</P>

<P>Senator Lockyer.. Is blackmailing the political process by refusing
to fund the courts in the state.&nbsp; He evidently is Union organizer.&nbsp;
I am told that he won't fund the courts unless the govenor allows the people
in the court to organize.&nbsp;Wouldn't it be nice if they all went on
strike.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>New Committee listed</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P>The present Penal code 190.8 states that Judges, that pronounce the
death penalty, are to have the record of trial certified 60 days after
presentation to the opposing councils. I know of a case that has gone 8
years without certification and another delay of certification that has
gone 6 years 6 months. The system hasn't even touch one that is 4 years
10 months old other than to appoint an appeals attorney. Judges, like every
one else, must abide by the law. If they don't then they too must suffer
sanctions.&nbsp;</P>

<P>The need for AB 195 is shown in the San Diego county log of individuals
that have been sent to death row. Out of the 23 that have been sent 17
records of trial have not been certified for a total of 81 &quot;man years&quot;
of delay of an administrative procedure. Orange county has sent 31 to death
row and 17 have affirmed 2 are waiting for a retrial and the balance are
in various stages of doing nothing. Theodore Frank, a child molester and
murderer of a 2 1/2 year old child he molested has been on death row 16
years and has just been given the death penalty again goes to the bottom
of the list in the appeal process. This is just one of the many ways the
Democratic Senate runs the cost of the death penalty up in elongation of
the appeal process. This why I suggest that maybe the California Supreme
Court is the greatest opponent of the death penalty. It is the function
of the Chief Justice to see the appeal process is, quoted in Penal Code
190.6, to see that the process is expeditiously handled.</P>

<P>It is important to write to these individual Senators and let them know
all of us are watching this issue that allows judges to not perform as
prescribed by law and nothing is done. If the individual is innocent he
must have the courts work for him also. There are a lot of those on death
row proclaiming they are innocent. Give then the opportunity to prove it
by starting the Automatic appeal as prescribed by law, not have them wait
10 years waiting for the Judge to certify the record.</P>

<P>Evidently it worked. Your efforts paid off. it got through the committee.&nbsp;</P>

</BLINK>There have been over 55,000 homicides committed in California since
the death penalty was re established here. This the equivalent of killing
every citizen in the towns of Carlsbad, Ca.. or the town of Pensacola,
Fla.. There has been over 467,000 homicides committed in the United States
since the U.S. Supreme court allowed executions in 1976 up to 1994. This
relates to the fact that every hour in the United States 2.8 people will
be a victim to a homicide. If you have 4 people at your dinner table tonight
it could mean that tomorrow night 3 won't be there.&nbsp;</P>

<P>At 1500, 3 pm, the 24th of April 1996, President Clinton signed the
Effective Death Penalty and the Anti terrorism bill that will deny any
more of the legal elongation of the death penalty as expressed in the Bonin
case. We have to see that the Lawyers don't have an opportunity to drag
it on, as in this Bonin case where the appeal lasted 12 years through 22
appeals. This will limit the appeal time frame. This states that after
a state has affirmed a death sentence, the murderer has one year to file
his federal appeal and one year to adjudicate it. .The supreme court has
up held this as of now. But you can bet the defense Lawyers are trying
to distroy it.</P>

</BLINK>We need your help in keeping a child molester behind bars. One
Landon Scruggs, # 196787, comes up for parole in August of this year. He
sexually molested his step daughter from the time she was 5 to the age
of 12 when her grandfather found out about it and had him locked up. He
will be release on parole in August unless we write enough letters to inform
the Parole Commission, of the state of Maryland, that molester must serve
the entire length of their judge's sentence, or he will be released. This
individual had sex with her, forced her to oral copulate him, and had her
and her brothers engage in sex act so he could watch. This little girl
was forced to sexually service her older cousins. AlI of this was over
a 7 year period. I ask , if he is released, do you want him near your children.
If not write to the Maryland Parole Commission, 6776 Reisterstown Rd suite
307, Baltimore, Maryland 21215-2341. Make sure that you give his name and
prison number, Landon Scruggs # 196787.</P>

<P>We wish to thank all of you that help in this matter of keeping Scruggs
locked up. Word was received the the State of Maryland denied him parole.
Now all we have to do is find out when his next appearance in front of
the board is scheduled.</P>

<P>It has been learned that we were successful in his not receiving another
parole hearing. He has to serve out the rest of his sentence.&nbsp;<BR>

They tend to be white, heterosexual, males in their twenties and thirties.
Their methodical rampages are almost always sexually motivated. Their killings
tend to be part of an elaborate sexual fantasy that builds up to climax
at the moment of their murderous outburst. They usually kill strangers
with cooling off periods between each crime. Many enjoy cannibalism, necrophilia
and keep trophy-like body parts as reminders of their work. Their violent
behavior is mostly directed towards women and children. However some homosexual
killers like to hunt gay men. Prostitutes, drifters, male hustlers and
hitchhikers seem to be the victims of choice for psychopaths on the make.
Most serial killers tend to believe that they have done no wrong.&nbsp;</P>

There is a bill in the California Senate that needs movement to become
law. It is AB 195, mention above, that states Judges must have the record
of trial certified in 90 days after sentencing in death penalty case or
they loose their pay. The Democratic Senate of the State of California
took out the sanctions against judges that don't perform ALL this bill
does is established a certified record so the appeal can commence. It is
just an administrative action and has nothing to do with the innocence
or guilt of the individual. It just requires Judges to perform. now no
sanctions for non compliance</P>

<P>Don't let people confuse the issue by stating that it is impossible
to certify 10 to 20 thousand pages of record in 90 days. All they have
to do is certify the previous days record before starting the next days
court action as the trial proceeds. If this is done then at the end of
the trial all the judge has to do is bundle the record up and send the
&quot;CERTIFIED&quot; record of trial to the Supreme Court as required
by law so the automatic appeal can commence. Where there is will there
is a way. Without enforcing these procedures in place today, we have cases
that, as shown above, take over 9 years 11 months just to try to certify
the record. In the past Judges have shown that they need pressure to do
what is required. But the Democratic Senate doesn't believe in sanctioning
Judges that don't comply with laws. All of you Californians need to write
to your Senators to pressure that committee to get the bill on the floor
of the Senate for a vote. If this bill passes it will shorten the appeal
in excess of 5 years which in turn will reduced the murders committed in
this State by showing that we don't condone. And possibly more important,
if you are on death row you get your date in court, as Carter states he
wants, in a reasonable time frame.&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>Factual Information<BR>
</FONT></FONT></I></B>According to data collected by the Federal Government
since 1930, during the 63 years ending in 1992, a total of 4,047 persons
were executed under civil authority. (Military authorities carried out
an additional 160 executions between 1930 and 1992.) Since the Supreme
Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, the United States have executed
188 prisoners through 1992:</P>

<P>1977 - 1 , 1979 - 2 , 1981 - 1, 1982 - 2 , 1983 - 5 , 1984 - 21, 1985
- 18 , 1986 - 18. 1987 - 25, 1988 - 11, 1989 - 16, 1990 - 23, 1991 - 14,
1992 - 31</P>

<P>All of this information is meaningless without the number of homicides
committed in these same periods to give the numbers a relationship to murders
committed. The execution rate in the United States is .0007 in relationship
to the number of homicides committed to Date. Hardly a deterrent message
sent to the public&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<HR SIZE=18 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>According to the 1993 Homicide and execution numbers in California there
were 4095 homicides and only 1 execution. For 1994 there was no executions
and 3699 more homicides. For a 2 year period there were 7793 less people
in California from willful homicides and only one execution. This gives
this State an execution rate of .000025664. Hardly a deterrent. The greatest
opponent of the death penalty, in California, is California's Supreme Court.
They fail to abide by the laws of this state in seeing that the legal process
is carried out as specified by law. It shows that Rose Bird, the Chief
Justice that was relieved of her position by the people, still has her
hands in the court by the Judicial procedures she placed in position, while
on the bench. This was done to delay the execution process of this state.,
if not deny the law of the land entirely. CLO is working to bring this
to the attention of the Executive and Legislative bodies of this state
seeking change. If you want to help in ridding the legal procedures of
this stench she, Rose Bird, has left in the system join a victims group
as a member and write the Governor and legislatives bodies asking them
to research the laws and flush her leanings out of the system. When this
is done then, hopefully, a more efficient court will be in place. Such
things as appointing attorneys to handle the automatic appeal shortly after
sentencing, not 3 1/2 year after. Getting the record of trial certified
in 90 days after sentencing, which will be law, not 8 plus years as they
delay the process now. The appeal can't commence until the record is certified
as the true happening of the trial procedure. AND, if the individual is
innocent an expeditious process must be in place to process the automatic
appeals here in California or throughout the entire US of A.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<HR SIZE=18 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>The US Senate voted 91-8 for passage of the Habeas Corpus reform Act
which is tied to the Anti terrorism Bill. The law has been signed by the
president and it will reduce the elongation of the appeals in the federal
system to 2 years maximum. If your state needs help in shortening the appeal
process look at California's AB 195 written by Assemblyman Bill Morrow
(Fax # 619-757-8087). His office will send you a copy.&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<HR SIZE=18 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>Now that the President has signed this bill we have cut the Death penalty
appeal process way back. California has 177 whose death penalty has been
affirmed by this State's Supreme Court. The question is, does this bill
affect them so that within 2 years there will be at least 177 execution
in this State??? If it does, then we will have helped shortened Dean Carter's,
Alex Bennett's boy and Carter's companions, stay on Death Row as he, Carter,&nbsp;
has requested.</P>

<P>News Flash 31 August 1996 AB 195 was affirmed by both houses and has
been signed by the Governor Pete Wilson. But One lesson I have learned,
you don't get everything you want. First they attached two other bills
to make a package to address the complete issue. It seems that the SENATE
took the sanctions to Judges, who failed to comply, out. They elongated
the process and slipped loop holes in AB 195. And most dastardly, they
stated that this process only applied to those sentenced after 1 January
1997. So those on death row have escaped this process. To make the matters
worse, the other two bills, AB2008, which provided funds to hire lawyers,
at $125 per hour, to handle those on death row now, made it through both
houses. AB1533 failed because Senator Wm. Lockyer, from Hayward, CA., would
not let the Criminal Procedures Committee vote on a minor change recommended
by the Assembly. It died because of the time frame, end of session. SB
1533 provided a watch dog committee to see that the process moved as directed.
So without a committee there are no funds to handle the appeal process
of those on death row now. The Senate watered down AB 195 so that it is
almost the same as before we started this request for change only it cover
7 pages instead of one. One positive note, Attorney General, Dan Lungren,
has written us and stated even watered down, it is better than before.
He believes that it will expedite the process. More important it gives
us a base to build on.</P>

<P>I just received information the Governor Wilson and others are working
to write a bill that will encompass both AB2008 and SB 1533.&nbsp; If this
is placed into law then those on death row now will have the opportunity
to appeal their sentences.&nbsp; As it is now they are denied the right
to appeal because the Judges who sentenced them won't certify the record
so the appellate attorney will have a true document to use to create an
appeal.&nbsp; Tell the Governor you support his effort.</P>
