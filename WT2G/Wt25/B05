In the March, 1982, issue of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, political

scientist James Q. Wilson and criminologist George Kelling co-authored the

cover story, "Broken Windows." By using the image of broken windows to explain

how neighborhoods might decay -- both physically and culturally -- if no one

attends faithfully to their maintenance, the authors argued that the best way

to fight crime was to fight the disorder that precedes it. Plagued by graffiti,

panhandling, farebeating, and a host of other problems,  the New York City

Transit Authority used the ideas contained in "Broken Windows" as a guide -- and

even brought Kelling on as a consultant -- in an effort to restore order to the

subway. The New York City Police Department soon followed suit with a

community-policing strategy focusing on order maintenance.  Despite initial

skepticism, the strategy caught on in both organizations and has resulted in

significant reductions in disorder and crime.<p>





Kelling and his wife, Catherine Coles -- a lawyer and anthropologist

specializing in urban issues and criminal prosecution -- have now published

<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0684824469/

theatlanticmonthA/"><i>Fixing Broken Windows: Restoring Order and Reducing 

Crime in Our Communities</a></i> (Free Press, 1996), a book that expands 

significantly on the <i>Atlantic</i> cover story. They examine the competing claims of individual

liberty and community in determining to what extent public spaces should be

protected; they emphasize that the "crime problem" is an amalgam of disorder,

fear, serious crime, and urban decay; and they contend that the current model

of the criminal-justice system has failed by not recognizing the links between

these elements and by ignoring the role citizens can -- and must -- play in

crime prevention.  They support these arguments with extensive research into

the history of policing,  into how court decisions have evolved to  address

public disorder, and into recent efforts to restore order and reduce crime in

America. The authors insist that, despite the many obstacles, order can be

restored in American cities, and they identify attainable policy

objectives that respect the legitimate rights of individuals while protecting

the interests of neighborhoods and communities.<p>





Kelling and Coles recently spoke with <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>'s Ryan Nally.<p>

<br>

<b><font size=5>W</font>hen you wrote "Broken Windows," were you intending it 

to turn into a book?</b><p>



<br>



<b>GK</b>: At that time, no. I had just finished the Newark Foot Patrol

Experiment -- a study designed to assess the relationship between order

maintenance and crime by putting police on foot patrol -- during which  I

discovered the link between foot patrols and reduced fear in communities. James

Q. Wilson, who had been asked by <i>The Atlantic</i> to do a piece at the time,

asked me if I wanted to write one with him. It was a time in policing when

nothing seemed to work. The Kansas City Preventive Patrol Experiment, which

examined the relationship between response time and citizen satisfaction with

police service in responding to calls, had suggested that riding around in cars

didn't pay off, and similar response-time studies by the National Institute of

Justice in five cities questioned the efficacy of 911. I don't think Wilson or

I understood the doors we were opening up by giving voice to  neighborhoods'

and communities' desperate demands for order or the potential of order 

maintenance for crime prevention and control.<p>



<br>



<b>You make the argument that "order maintenance" is essential to restoring

order and reducing crime in America. Why is it so important?</b><p>



<br>



<b>GK</b>: Disorder -- graffiti on a subway, prostitutes harassing husbands in

front of their wives and kids, panhandlers sticking cups under peoples' noses

-- sends very strong signals to citizens that things are out of control. And it

also sends signals to predators. Citizens no longer feel comfortable trying to

protect their own territory, and the police are indifferent.<p>



<br>



<b>CC</b>: In the book we examine some of the studies that have been done around the

country, especially by Wes Skogan at Northwestern University, documenting the

links among disorderly behavior, the fear that it causes among citizens, the

gradual withdrawal of frightened citizens from the street and public places,

and the consequent lessening of social control. Those elements result in an

influx of more serious crime and the eventual movement of neighborhoods into a

downward spiral that ends in urban decay.  Problems of disorder come right at

the beginning of that progression. Once they are present and then get out of

hand, the potential for serious crime and urban decay is very great.<p>



<br>

<img 

src="colkel.gif" border=1 width=230 height=161 align=right hspace=15 

vspace=5></a>



<b>What do you see as some of the main obstacles to order restoration?</b><p>



<br>



<b>CC</b>: There's a real misunderstanding about some of the most basic roots

of disorder. Many people think that trying to regulate disorder means jumping

on the homeless and pitting the rights of the rich against those of the poor.

That sort of thinking is a definite obstacle. What we need to focus on is

dealing with <i>acts by people</i> and regulating troublesome unlawful

behavior. We are not trying to legislate against the homeless, and in no way do

we condone cities' or states' ignoring the very real problems of the poor.

Order restoration requires the adoption of a local perspective. Police,

prosecutors, and many parts of our criminal-justice processes -- I hesitate to

use the word "system" because I don't think we really have a coherent, unified

criminal-justice system -- have to be involved locally with citizens assisting

them in reclaiming their own neighborhoods. <p>



<br>



<b>Law obviously plays an important role in shaping the extent to which order

maintenance can be carried out.  Does the law ever <i>hinder</i> the

maintenance of public order?</b><p>



<br>



<b>CC</b>: Yes, but let me begin with a caveat. I don't believe that law

hinders the maintenance of public order by requiring that police respect and

protect the fundamental liberties of individual citizens. There are

<i>other</i> ways, however, in which the law does hinder the maintenance of

public order. One problem seems to be inherent in our legal- and 

judicial-processing system: it looks at individual cases apart from the broader context

within which they take place. One individual incident of public drunkenness or

street prostitution, for example, may not be terribly troublesome, but when you

get an agglomeration of these kinds of behaviors -- around a school where there

are many kids, for instance -- then you have a much more serious situation.

Judges are asked to make decisions about the lawfulness and the impact of

individual acts. This is problematic. Increasingly we're advising cities and

states to bring into court the argument that aggregated behavior is the real

problem. One of the other problems is the tendency of advocates for the

homeless -- the ones challenging much of the order-maintenance legislation

around the country -- to present an exaggerated defense for the rights of these

individuals. Very often the argument is that the legislation is restrictive of

speech rights. What's lost in many of these cases is attention to the interests

of community. <p>



<br>



<b>GK</b>: It is not just the law but how it is interpreted. For example, Tampa had a

city ordinance on loitering for the purpose of prostitution. The Supreme Court

struck down the ordinance because it felt that police officers wouldn't have

been able to tell the difference between prostitutes plying their trade and

housewives greeting their husbands, and that even if they could tell the

difference the police would still use the law to harass citizens. That sort of

thinking is unduly cynical. We're very concerned throughout <i>Fixing Broken

Windows </i>with how to control the police, but to suggest that order-maintenance

laws are going to be used on a wholesale basis to harass citizens is a gross

overstatement.<p>



<br>



<b>In the 1960s there was a shift  away from community-based thinking to an

ethos of individualism that still thrives today in America. How has this shift

affected order maintenance?</b><p>



<br>



<b>GK</b>: Starting in the 1960s the notion of disorderly behavior as a sign of

cultural pluralism developed and soon penetrated professional and bureaucratic

approaches to crime and disorder -- as exemplified by  President Johnson's

Commission on Crime in 1967 that said that we have to do something about

disorder but that this task was not the primary business of the police. The

role of the police, according to the Commission, was to arrest people for

serious crimes and put them into the criminal-justice system. Of course that

was intuitively very  appealing; it's nice to think that the police are not too

intrusive. But the result was that city streets were abandoned by police,

prosecutors, parole, and probation agents -- and therefore citizens as well. <p>



<br>



<b>You perceive much of modern policing as largely impersonal and unresponsive

to citizens' requests. Why?</b><p>



<br>





<b>GK</b>: This is an historical problem that has to do with police corruption

and abuse; the main strategy this century has been largely to try to isolate

the police from communities and citizens in hopes of limiting potential sources

of corruption. Many police departments developed rules that police couldn't

"live" on their beats,  and rules still exist in some police stations that ban

officers from engaging in idle conversation with citizens. Police executives

for a generation asked, How do we prevent corruption and abuse? But if you

start out with a different question --  How do you provide quality policing and

protect communities? -- and make that the primary determinant of how you

proceed, you understand that the <i>real </i>business of policing is to 

prevent crime. The police <i>have</i> to be on the streets talking to citizens

because at all levels information is

the key to crime prevention. And a lot of information is gleaned from

encounters with those who commit low-level offenses. If you don't deal with

low-level offenders, often you won't get access to those people carrying guns

in the subway, for example.<p>



<br>



<b>Has "911 policing" contributed to this unresponsiveness as well?</b><p>



<br>



<b>GK</b>: It's a disaster. Not only does it not do any good, it completely

drives how departments are structured. The idea that 911 is going to provide

some solution to crime is fatuous; it turns our police into an

emergency-response system. 911 has effectively de-policed American streets. <p>



<br>



<b>Do you think that the criminal-justice system -- the paradigm that has

determined how order should be maintained throughout this century -- will ever

change? What will be the repercussions if it does not?</b><p>



<br>



<b>CC</b>: We're seeing change already. As I go around the country and work in

various cities, I see more and more community-based initiatives. Community

policing has perhaps received the greatest recognition, but we're also seeing

the development of community-based courts and prosecution efforts in which

prosecutors are  in neighborhoods working with citizens to set priorities on

which cases to charge and prosecute. Probation and corrections officials, too,

are starting to work with communities. There is a definite movement away from

the idea that you have professional police, prosecutors, and courts all at a

distance, removed from citizens. There is also an increasing emphasis on

proactive measures and joint problem-solving efforts that bring police together

with prosecutors and citizens, and there are very broad-based efforts taking

place at the local level to address problems of public space and disorder.<p>



<br>



<b>GK</b>: Clearly the criminal-justice-system model is still robust. Neither

Catherine nor I wants to trivialize it. But change is happening. Take the Safe

Neighborhood Initiatives in Boston, in which a Democratic attorney general and

a Republican district attorney have started Safe Neighborhood Initiatives

that involve all the resources of the community. Six months ago in New Haven

the community, police, and city agencies were working together, but probation

wasn't involved; now probation officers are meeting problem kids inside of the

district police stations. All over the country we're seeing new community

paradigms of crime control that operate on a whole different set of

assumptions. The old assumption was that professionals knew best and that they

would solve problems. The new model acknowledges that citizens and communities

understand their problems best and that therefore citizens should be in

leadership positions and should draw on help from criminal-justice

institutions. This repositioning of the professional versus the community in

solving problems of disorder is gaining ground rapidly. <p>



<br>



<b>CC</b>: We're seeing private citizens linking up again with criminal-justice

processes. For so long we've read about how citizens are alienated from the

police, courts, and judges. What we're now witnessing is citizens taking

responsibility for public safety and crime prevention and at the same time

working with police and prosecutors. This is a fundamental change.<p>



<br>



<b>But how far can citizens legitimately go in restoring order to their

communities? Should vigilantism be a concern in this respect?</b><p>



<br>



<b>GK</b>: We have to worry about going too far. Communities can be

warm and friendly places for people who live there, but they can also be petty

and mean. Police and citizen groups need to be tolerant. Because

African-American kids playing basketball on a particular court bothers some

people doesn't mean that the court should be wiped out. We're not talking about

trying to regulate life excessively. But sometimes lack of official action can

lead to intolerance. When, for example, citizens have been dealing with

aggressive drug dealers and panhandlers for a long time and see nothing being

done, they understandably become indignant and sometimes propose locking

criminals up and throwing away the key. But when community courts, such as the

Midtown Community Court in Manhattan, and police begin to take action and hold

people accountable for their behavior, these same citizens become more tolerant

and understanding.<p>



<br>



<b>CC</b>: I often go to neighborhood-association and crime-watch-group meetings and

sometimes see examples of incipient vigilantism. Yet I also see prosecutors

meeting with groups of people in local neighborhoods, explaining which actions

are legal and which aren't. What you then have is a discussion among people who

are able to learn the appropriate limits. Citizens, in effect, become better

educated. <p>



<br>



<b>Adam Walinsky, in his <i>Atlantic </i>cover story, "The Crisis of Public

Order" (July, 1995), offered a very bleak outlook on the future of crime in

America. Yet <i>Fixing Broken Windows</i> ends quite optimistically regarding

the prospects for restoring order and bringing crime under control  in America.

Why so optimistic?</b><p>



<br>



<b>GK</b>: If anyone had told me in 1985 -- when every train in New York City

was covered with multiple layers of graffiti, when people were threatening

commuters and publicly urinating and defecating in trains, when panhandlers

were intimidating people, and when robberies were increasing -- that by 1995

crime would no longer be a serious problem in New York City subways, I would

have thought they were crazy. The reason we're optimistic is that we're seeing

progress and hope in city after city. New York City is the greatest example,

but we can also point to areas in Baltimore, Charlotte, Seattle, and Boston.

Had anyone said a year and a half ago that Boston would have no youth or

gang-related murders in 1996, everyone would have laughed. But because the

police have worked very carefully, and because citizen groups, prosecutors, and

probation officers have worked intelligently together after thoughtful

planning, they have achieved astounding results. <p>



<br>



<b>CC</b>: The presiding judge in East Boston, for example, has developed a program in

which young people who are violators must live under a court-imposed curfew. He

has told these kids that if they get on the honor roll they're off of the

curfew. Recently he had half a dozen problem students make the honor roll as a

result. The judge knows there isn't enough jail space for everybody and that he

can't sentence every kid to jail. So instead he has worked very closely with

the community, police, and prosecutors. It's a community-based effort in which

the citizens help to set priorities for the prosecutors and police, many of

which have to do with addressing order maintenance.  If you get people focused

on these things the results can be tremendous. <p>



<br>



<b>GK</b>: The old model was send a car, make an arrest, and incarcerate. Those were

the only options, basically. What we're seeing now is something guided by a

point of view and set of values. Communities, the criminal-justice system, and 

city agencies are moving forward, in ways that they didn't in the past, because 

they have to. <p>

<br>

<br>	





<font size=4> <font size=5>T</font>he issue of

physician-assisted suicide has at last made its way before the Supreme Court.

The first hearing, which took place on Wednesday, January 8, was uncharacteristically philosophical for this court. "Most of us have parents and

other loved ones who have been through the dying process, and we've thought

about these things," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out during the

session.<p>



<p>



The controversy surrounding the issue is not new. Writing in <i>The Atlantic</i> in

<A HREF="../../../election/connection/abortion/mag.htm">"Death, Legal and Illegal"</A> (1974), theology professor Daniel C. Maguire

considered some of the legal ramifications of deliberate, non-malevolent

termination of human life, focusing primarily on cases of "mercy killing." He

suggested that current United States law is incapable of addressing the

subtleties of mercy-killing cases: "Mercy killings<nobr> . . . </nobr>do not fit into any of

the categories of unjustifiable homicide available in American law. They are

not murder in the first or second degree, nor are they a form of criminal

manslaughter." He expressed a hope that a better-elaborated set of laws would

soon be enacted so that assisted-suicide cases could be considered on their own

terms rather than in the context of laws designed for very different

situations. <p>

weekly columns on word histories for CBC radio.<p>



	I share <i>The Atlantic</i>'s penchant for the origins of words and, in fact, don't

consider a dinner at anyone's house complete unless someone has run to the

dictionary to settle a dispute or just a point of curiosity.  <i>Cupboard

Love</i> (Bain & Cox) will solve dozens of what, in my family, often become heated

arguments. Morton lays out the histories of hundreds of food-related terms as

deftly and completely as any casual reader could wish.<p>



	Here are three: the roots of "recipe,"  "lentil"

(one of those explanations that makes perfect sense the minute you hear it), 

and -- 

one of my favorite points of trivia -- the disputed origins of "apple-pie order."

I reread this little story every time I see  kitchen cabinets that

are neater than mine, which is to say in just about any kitchen I visit.

<p>



	Here, too, are two recipes just right for a January evening: a satisfying

lentil soup from the food authority Barbara Kafka, whose books on microwave

cooking have shown cooks that the appliance isn't just for reheating, and an apple

pie from Susan Purdy, whose <i>As Easy as Pie</i> is one of those books I turn to for

automatic reference.  <i>Cupboard Love</i> will become one, too.<p>

<font size=3><b><i> From </i>Cupboard Love<i>, by Mark Morton</i></b></font><br>

<center><h2><b>Word Histories</b></h2></center>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><hr

<p>

</font><b>Recipe</b><p>



When the word <i>recipe</i> appeared in English in the fifteenth century, it

referred only to directions for making medicines; not for another three hundred

years, in the early eighteenth century, did <i>recipe</i> also come to denote

directions for preparing a dish of food.  Before this modern sense of recipe

was developed, instructions for making food were called <i>receipts</i>, a

usage dating all the way back to the fourteenth century.  The difference

between calling such culinary instructions <i>receipts</i> or <i>recipes</i> is

slight, at least in so far as both words derive from the same source, the Latin

<i>recipere</i>, meaning to receive (the words are spelt differently because

recipe developed from the present tense of <i>recipere</i> while <i>receipt</i>

developed from a past tense); these two words became associated with cooking

because when you make a dish you "receive" into your hand the various

ingredients required by the dish.<p>







Incidentally, the pharmaceutical symbol R<sub>X</sub> (sometimes represented by Rx)

stands for <i>recipe</i>; the cross-bar represents the staff of Jove, the

patron of doctors, under whose auspices the medical <i>recipe</i> was to be

prepared.<p>







<b>Lentil</b><p>



If you have less than perfect eyesight, you probably have, at this very

moment, two lentils perched on either side of your nose -- at least you do in

so far as the English word for lens is a direct adoption of the Latin word

<i>lens</i>, meaning <i>lentil</i>.  Lens was adopted by seventeenth century

opticians because the convex shape of the lentil resembled that of the pieces

of glass they cut to make telescopes and microscopes.  The Latin 

<i>lens</i> is also, of course, the source of the English word <i>lentil</i>:  in Late Latin the

name of the leguminous plant was turned into a diminutive -- <i>lenticula,</i>

meaning <i>little lentil</i> -- which was subsequently adopted by French as

<i>lentille</i>.  English then adopted this French word in the mid thirteenth

century, changing the spelling to <i>lentil</i> in the process.<p>





<b>Apple-pie order</b><p>



A proper chef always keeps her kitchen in apple-pie order:  spoons and forks do

not fraternize wildly in the cutlery drawer, lids do not wander from their

containers, salt shakers do not plummet into the crevice between oven and wall.

Such a compulsion for culinary organization is known as <i>apple-pie order</i>,

an idiom that may have grown out of how apple pies, in the good old days, were

made by carefully arranging apple slices in a highly stylized, vertical pattern

(which was then hidden under a crust of dough).  Alternatively, the <i>apple

pie</i> part of the idiom may have originated as an English corruption of the

French phrase <i>nappes plices</i>, meaning <i>folded linen</i>, or as an

English corruption of the French phrase <i>cap-a-pie</i>, meaning <i>head to

foot</i> (Shakespeare uses this idiom when he has Horatio describe Hamlet's

ghostly father as armed <i>cap-a-pie</i>):  both French phrases -- <i>nappes

plices</i> and <i>cap-a-pie</i> -- are suggestive of minute attention to

detail.  Whatever its origin, <i>apple-pie order</i> was first recorded in

English in the late eighteenth century.<p>

</center>

<font size=6>T</font>his is IT! -- what our country and flag are as American as. Since the earliest

colonial days, apple pies have been enjoyed in America for breakfast, for an

entree, and for dessert. Colonists wrote home about them and foreign visitors

noted apple pie as one of our first culinary specialties. According to the

<i>American Heritage Cookbook </i>(Penguin Books, 1967) a Swedish parson named

Dr. Acrelius wrote back to his family in 1758: "'Apple-pie is used through the whole year, and when fresh apples are no longer to be had,

dried ones are used. It is the evening meal of children. House-pie,

in country places, is made of apples neither peeled nor freed from their

cores, and its crust is not broken if a wagon wheel goes over it.'" In 1851, a

Norwegian immigrant living in Wisconsin wrote to friends back home,

"'Strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries thrive here. From these they make

a wonderful dish combined with syrup and sugar, which is called <i>pai.

</i>I can tell you that is something that glides easily down your throat; they

also make the same sort of <i>pai </i>out of apples . . . and that is really

the most superb.'"<p>







For pies, select apples that are firm and tart such as Greenings, Jonathans,

Cortlands, or Granny Smiths. Eating apples such as Delicious or McIntosh soften

too much when baked. Serve apple pie warm, topped with a slice of sharp cheddar

cheese or a dollop of heavy cream.<p>







<i>Advance preparation: </i>Apples may be sliced, seasoned as described below,

and frozen in individual pie-sized

packets in advance  and pastry can be prepared ahead and frozen.  Complete pies

can also be frozen before or after baking.<br>



<i>Special equipment: </i>9-inch pie plate; rolling pin; pastry brush;

 aluminum foil strips or frame.<br>



<i>Baking time:  </i>425&degF for 15 minutes; 350&degF for 40 to

 45 minutes. 

<br>



<i>Quantity: </i>One 9-inch pie.<br>





<table border=0 cellpadding=10>

<tr><td width=50%>

<b>

Unbaked pastry for a 2-crust, 9-inch (unsweetened) pie<br>



Egg glaze: 1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water<br>



6 to 8 medium-large Granny Smith or Greening apples, peeled and sliced



(6 to 8 cups; quantity determines height of pie)<br>



1/3 to 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed



(amount depends upon tartness of apples)<br></b>

</td><td width=50%><b>

Juice of 1 large lemon<br>



2 to 3 tablespoons flour<br>



1/2 teaspoon each nutmeg and <br>



cinnamon<br>



2 tablespoons butter, cut up<p>





Optional: 4 tablespoons plain cracker or cornflake crumbs<br>



Granulated sugar or milk for glaze

</tr></table></b><p>

<b>1.</b> Prepare the pastry, roll it out, and line the pie plate. Trim 1/2-

inch pastry overhang. To moisture-proof the lower crust, brush with egg glaze and/or sprinkle with crumbs. Preheat the

oven to 425&degF.<p>



<b>2.</b> In large bowl, toss the sliced apples with the sugar, lemon juice, flour,

and spices. Add fruit to pastry-lined pan and dot with butter. Brush egg glaze over edge of lower crust.<p>



<b>3.</b> Roll out top crust and fit it over the fruit. Trim 3/4 inch overhang. Fold

the edge under the bottom crust and pinch together to seal, making a raised rim

all around. Flute the edge as desired. Cut vent holes in the top. Brush the top

of the pie with egg glaze and sprinkle with sugar, or simply brush with milk or

leave plain.<p>



<b>4.</b> Set the pie in the lower third of the preheated oven and bake 10 to l2

minutes. Reduce the heat to 350&degF, raise pie to center of oven, and bake an

additional 40 to 45 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the fruit

is tender when pierced with a fork through a vent hole. Check the pie halfway

through the baking time and add a foil edging if necessary to prevent the crust

from overbrowning. Cool the pie on a wire rack. Serve warm as is or topped by

slices of sharp cheddar cheese, vanilla ice cream, or other toppings. <p>





<b>Variations:</b><p>



<li><b><i>Bourbon Apple Pie. </i></b>Prepare Old-Fashioned

Apple Pie, but sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons bourbon over the sliced apple filling before baking pie.<p>



<li><b><i>Apple-Walnut Pie. </i></b>Prepare Old-Fashioned Apple Pie using 3/4 cup

 brown sugar

and adding 1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts to the apple filling. You can 

also add 1/2 cup seedless raisins if you like.<p>



<li><b><i>Apple-Cranberry-Walnut Pie. </i></b>Prepare Old-Fashioned

Apple Pie with 3/4 cup brown sugar and add along with the apples: 1 cup whole fresh or

frozen cranberries plus 1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts. Top with egg-glazed

lattice topping. The pie can also be baked in a tart pan and served

free-standing, garnished with Orange-flavored Whipped Cream.<p>

<p>



<li><b><i>Dutch Apple Pie.</i></b> Prepare Old-Fashioned Apple Pie, 

cutting a 1/4-inch round steam vent in the top crust.  Glaze the top and 

bake as directed, but 5 minutes before the end of the baking time, pour 1/2 

cup heavy cream into the vent hole.  Bake 5 minutes more and serve warm. 

<p>



<li><b><i>Apple-Custard Cream Pie. </i></b>This pie has a creamy custard filling blended with the

apples. Use medium or soft (eating type) apples such as McIntosh or Golden

Delicious, as harder cooking apples may take a little longer to bake.

Prepare Old-Fashioned Apple Pie using 1/2 cup granulated sugar instead of the brown sugar. Omit the

lemon juice but use all other ingredients. Just before baking, pour over the

fruit in the pastry-lined pan a custard made by whisking together 1 egg plus 3/4 cup heavy cream. <i>(Note: </i>You can substitute

pears, cored and sliced, for half the apples in this

recipe.)<p> 



<li><b><i>Deep-Dish Apple Pie. </i></b>Prepare Old-Fashioned

Apple Pie or the Apple-Cranberry-Walnut Variation, but use 6 to 7 cups sliced apple filling. Prepare only half the

pastry recipe; omit the bottom crust. Place the fruit in a 7-to 8-cup

(1/2 to 2 quarts) oven-proof baking dish at least 2 inches deep. Cover the fruit with pastry rolled out and

fitted to the edges of the pan, and cut steam vents as for a regular crust.

Glaze the top if you wish.

<p>



Deep-dish pie can also be topped with a lattice crust or with Oat-Wheat

Germ Streusel or Nut-Crumb Streusel Topping. Follow baking time for a regular 2-crust

pie.<p>







<i>(Note: </i>For an even greater amount of fruit, double the filling in the

original recipe and use a larger pan.)<p>

alt="T"></font>O an extent that astonishes a foreigner, modern America is 
<i>about</i> the
holding of elections. Americans do not merely have elections on the first
Tuesday after the first Monday of November in every year divisible by four.
They have elections on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November in
every year divisible by two. In addition, five states have elections in
odd-numbered years. Indeed, there is no year in the United States -- ever -- when a
major statewide election is not being held somewhere. To this catalogue of
general elections has of course to be added an equally long catalogue of
primary elections (for example, forty-three presidential primaries last year).
Moreover, not only do elections occur very frequently in the United States but
the number of jobs legally required to be filled by them is enormous -- from the
presidency of the United States to the post of local consumer advocate in New
York. It has been estimated that no fewer than half a million elective offices
are filled or waiting to be filled in the United States today.<p>

Americans take the existence of their never-ending election campaign for
granted. Some like it, some dislike it, and most are simply bored by it. But
they are all conscious of it, in the same way that they are conscious of Mobil,
McDonald's, <i>Larry King Live</i>, Oprah Winfrey, the Dallas Cowboys, the Ford
Motor Company, and all the other symbols and institutions that make up the rich
tapestry of American life. <p>

To a visitor to America's shores, however, the never-ending campaign presents a
largely unfamiliar spectacle. In other countries election campaigns have both
beginnings and ends, and there are even periods, often prolonged periods, when
no campaigns take place at all. Other features of American elections are also
unfamiliar. In few countries do elections and campaigns cost as much as they do
in the United States. In no other country is the role of organized political
parties so limited.<p>

America's permanent election campaign, together with other aspects of American
electoral politics, has one crucial consequence, little noticed but vitally
important for the functioning of American democracy. Quite simply, the American
electoral system places politicians in a highly vulnerable position.
Individually and collectively they are more vulnerable, more of the time, to
the vicissitudes of electoral politics than are the politicians of any other
democratic country. Because they are more vulnerable, they devote more of their
time to electioneering, and their conduct in office is more continuously
governed by electoral considerations. I will argue that American politicians'
constant and unremitting electoral preoccupations have deleterious consequences
for the functioning of the American system. They consume time and scarce
resources. Worse, they make it harder than it would otherwise be for the system
as a whole to deal with some of America's most pressing problems. Americans
often complain that their system is not sufficiently democratic. I will argue
that, on the contrary, there is a sense in which the system is too democratic
and ought to be made less so.<p>

Although this article is written by a foreigner, a Canadian citizen who happens
to live in Great Britain, it is not written in any spirit of moral or
intellectual superiority. Americans over the years have had quite enough of
Brits and others telling them how to run their affairs. I have no wish to
prolong their irritation. What follows is the reflections of a candid 
friend.<p>

alt="P"></font>OLITICS and government in the United States are marked by the fact that U.S.
elected officials in many cases have very short terms of office <i>and</i> face
the prospect of being defeated in primary elections <i>and</i> have to run for
office more as individuals than as standard-bearers for their party <i>and
</i>have continually to raise large sums of money in order to finance their own
election campaigns. Some of these factors operate in other countries. There is
no other country, however, in which all of them operate, and operate
simultaneously. The cumulative consequences, as we shall see, are both
pervasive and profound.<p>

The U.S. Constitution sets out in one of its very first sentences that "the
House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year
by the people of the several states." When the Founding Fathers decided on such

</table>a short term of office for House members, they were setting a precedent that
has been followed by no other major democratic country. In Great Britain,
France, Italy, and Canada the constitutional or legal maximum for the duration
of the lower house of the national legislature is five years. In Germany and
Japan the equivalent term is four years. Only in Australia and New Zealand,
whose institutions are in some limited respects modeled on those of the United
States, are the legal maximums as short as three years. In having two-year
terms the United States stands alone.<p>

Members of the Senate are, of course, in a quite different position. Their
constitutionally prescribed term of office, six years, is long by anyone's
standards. But senators' six-year terms are not all they seem. In the first
place, so pervasive is the electioneering atmosphere that even newly elected
senators begin almost at once to lay plans for their re-election campaigns.
<A HREF="http://www.nydems.org/moynihan/moynihan.html">Senator Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan</A>, of New York, recalls that when he first came
to the Senate, in 1977, his colleagues when they met over lunch or a drink
usually talked about politics and policy. Now they talk about almost nothing
but the latest opinion polls. In the second place, the fact that under the
Constitution the terms of a third of the Senate end every two years means that
even if individual senators do not feel themselves to be under continuing
electoral pressure, the Senate as a whole does. Despite the Founders'
intentions, the Senate's collective electoral sensibilities increasingly
resemble those of the House.<p>

Most Americans seem unaware of the fact, but the direct primary -- a
government-organized popular election to nominate candidates for public
office -- is, for better or worse, an institution peculiar to the United States.
Neither primary elections nor their functional equivalents exist anywhere else
in the democratic world. It goes without saying that their effect is to add a
further dimension of uncertainty and unpredictability to the world of American
elective politicians.<p>

In most other countries the individual holder of public office, so long as he
or she is reasonably conscientious and does not gratuitously offend local or
regional party opinion, has no real need to worry about renomination. To be
sure, cases of parties refusing to renominate incumbent legislators are not
unknown in countries such as France, Germany, and Canada, but they are
relatively rare and tend to occur under unusual circumstances. The victims are
for the most part old, idle, or alcoholic. <p>

The contrast between the rest of the world and the United States could hardly
be more striking. In 1978 no fewer than 104 of the 382 incumbent members of the
House of Representatives who sought re-election faced primary opposition. In
the following three elections the figures were ninety-three out of 398 (1980),
ninety-eight out of 393 (1982), and 130 out of 409 (1984). More recently, in
1994, nearly a third of all House incumbents seeking re-election, 121 out of
386, had to face primary opposition, and in the Senate the proportion was even
higher: eleven out of twenty-six. Even those incumbents who did not face
opposition could seldom be certain in advance that they were not going to. The
influence -- and the possibility -- of primaries is pervasive. As we shall see, the
fact that incumbents usually win is neither here nor there.<p>

To frequent elections and primary elections must be added another factor that
contributes powerfully to increasing the electoral vulnerability of U.S.
politicians: the relative lack of what we might call "party cover." In most
democratic countries the fate of most politicians depends not primarily on
their own endeavors but on the fate -- locally, regionally, or nationally -- of
their party. If their party does well in an election, so do they. If not, not.
The individual politician's interests and those of his party are bound
together.<p>

In contrast, America's elective politicians are on their own -- not only in
relation to politicians in most other countries but also in absolute terms.
Party is still a factor in U.S. electoral politics, but it is less so than
anywhere else in the democratic world. As a result, American legislators
seeking re-election are forced to raise their own profiles, to make their own
records, and to fight their own re-election campaigns. <p>

If politicians are so vulnerable electorally, it may be protested, why aren't
more of them defeated? In particular, why aren't more incumbent congressmen and
senators defeated? The analysis here would seem to imply a very high rate of
turnover in Congress, but in fact the rate -- at least among incumbents seeking
re-election -- is notoriously low. How can this argument and the facts of
congressional incumbents' electoral success be reconciled?<p>

This objection has to be taken seriously, because the facts on which it is
based are substantially correct. The number of incumbent congressmen and
senators defeated in either primary or general elections <i>is</i> low. But to
say that because incumbent members of Congress are seldom defeated, they are
not really vulnerable electorally is to miss two crucial points. The first is
that precisely because they are vulnerable, they go to prodigious lengths to
protect themselves. Like workers in nuclear-power stations, they take the most
extreme safety precautions, and the fact that the precautions are almost
entirely successful does not make them any less necessary.<p>

Second, congressmen and senators go to inordinate lengths to secure re-election
because, although they may objectively be safe (in the view of journalists and
academic political scientists), they do not <i>know</i> they are safe -- and even
if they think they are, the price of being wrong is enormous. The probability
that anything will go seriously wrong with a nuclear-power station may approach
zero, but the stations tend nevertheless to be built away from the centers of
large cities. A congressman or a senator may believe that he is reasonably
safe, but if he wants to be re-elected, he would be a fool to act on that
belief.<p>

<a name="RTFToC2">HOW THEY CAME TO BE VULNERABLE
</a></h3>
</center>

<font size=5><img src="../../../dropcaps/A-small.gif" align=left height=44
alt="A"></font>MERICAN politicians run scared -- and are right to do so. And they run
more scared than the politicians of any other democratic country -- again
rightly. How did this come to be so?<p>

The short answer is that the American people like it that way. They are, and
have been for a very long time, the Western world's hyperdemocrats. They are
keener on democracy than almost anyone else and are more determined that
democratic norms and practices should pervade every aspect of national life. To
explore the implications of this central fact about the United States, and to
see how it came to be, we need to examine two different interpretations of the
term "democracy." Both have been discussed from time to time by political
philosophers, but they have never been codified and they certainly cannot be
found written down in a constitution or any other formal statement of political
principles. Nevertheless, one or the other underpins the political practice of
every democratic countryeven if, inevitably, the abstract conception and the day-
to-day practice are never perfectly matched.<p>

One of these interpretations might be labeled "division of labor." In this
view, there are in any democracy two classes of people -- the governors and the
governed. The function of the governors is to take decisions on the basis of
what they believe to be in the country's best interests and to act on those
decisions. If public opinion broadly supports the decisions, that is a welcome
bonus. If not, too bad. The views of the people at large are merely one datum
among a large number of data that need to be considered. They are not accorded
any special status. Politicians in countries that operate within this view can
frequently be heard using phrases like "the need for strong leadership" and
"the need to take tough decisions." They often take a certain pride in doing
what they believe to be right even if the opinion of the majority is opposed to
it.<p>

The function of the governed in such a system, if it is a genuine democracy, is
very important but strictly limited. It is not to determine public policy or to
decide what is the right thing to do. Rather, it is to go to the polls from
time to time to choose those who will determine public policy and decide what
the right thing is: namely, the governors. The deciding of issues by the
electorate is secondary to the election of the individuals who are to do the
deciding. The analogy is with choosing a doctor. The patient certainly chooses
which doctor to see but does not normally decide (or even try to decide) on the
detailed course of treatment. The division of labor is informal but clearly
understood.<p>

It is probably fair to say that most of the world's major democracies -- Great
Britain, France, Germany, Japan -- operate on this basis. The voters go to the
polls every few years, and in between times it is up to the government of the
day to get on with governing. Electing a government and governing are two
different businesses. Electioneering is, if anything, to be deplored if it gets
in the way of governing.<p>

This is a simplified picture, of course. Democratically elected politicians are
ultimately dependent on the electorate, and if at the end of the day the
electorate does not like what they are doing, they are dead. Nevertheless, the
central point remains. The existing division of labor is broadly accepted.<p>

The other interpretation of democracy, the one dominant in America, might be
called the "agency" view, and it is wholly different. According to this view,
those who govern a country should function as no more than the agents of the
people. The job of the governors is not to act independently and to take
whatever decisions they believe to be in the national interest but, rather, to
reflect in all their actions the views of the majority of the people, whatever
those views may be. Governors are not really governors at all; they are
representatives, in the very narrow sense of being in office solely to
represent the views of those who sent them there. <p>

In the agency view, representative government of the kind common throughout the
democratic world can only be second-

best.
The ideal system would be one in which there were no politicians or middlemen
of any kind and the people governed themselves directly; the political system
would take the form of more or less continuous town meetings or referenda,
perhaps conducted by means of interactive television. Most Americans, at
bottom, would still like to see their country governed by a town meeting.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC3">WHY THEIR VULNERABILITY MATTERS</a></h3>
</center>

<font size=5><img src="../../../dropcaps/I-small.gif" align=left height=44
alt="I"></font>N this political ethos, finding themselves inhabiting a turbulent and torrid
electoral environment, most American elective officials respond as might be
expected: in an almost Darwinian way. They adapt their behavior -- their
roll-call votes, their introduction of bills, their committee assignments,
their phone calls, their direct-mail letters, their speeches, their press
releases, their sound bites, whom they see, how they spend their time, their
trips abroad, their trips back home, and frequently their private and family
lives -- to their environment: that is, to their primary and overriding need for
electoral survival. The effects are felt not only in the lives of individual
officeholders and their staffs but also in America's political institutions as
a whole and the shape and content of U.S. public policy.<p>

It all begins with officeholders' immediate physical environment: with bricks,
mortar, leather, and wood paneling. The number of congressional buildings and
the size of congressional staffs have ballooned in recent decades. At the start
of the 1960s most members of the House of Representatives contented themselves
with a small inner office and an outer office; senators' office suites were not
significantly larger. Apart from the Capitol itself, Congress was reasonably
comfortably housed in four buildings, known to Washington taxi drivers as the
Old and New House and Senate Office Buildings. The designations Old and New
cannot be used any longer, however, because there are now so many even newer
congressional buildings. <p>

Congressional staffs have grown at roughly the same rate, the new buildings
having been built mainly to house the staffs. In 1957 the total number of
people employed by members of the House and Senate as personal staff was 3,556.
By 1991 the figure had grown to 11,572  --  a more than threefold increase within
the political lifetime of many long-serving members. Last year the total number
of people employed by Congress in all capacities, including committee staffs
and the staffs of support agencies like the Congressional Research Service, was
32,820, making Congress by far the most heavily staffed legislative branch in
the world.<p>

Much of the growth of staff in recent decades has been in response to the
growth of national government, to Congress's insistence on strengthening its
policymaking role in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, and to
decentralization within Congress, which has led subcommittee chairmen and the
subcommittees themselves to acquire their own staffs. But there is no doubt
that the increase is also in response to congressional incumbents'
ever-increasing electoral exposure. Congress itself has become an integral part
of America's veritable "elections industry."<p>

One useful measure of the changes that have taken place  --  and also an important
consequence of the changes  --  is the increased proportion of staff and staff time
devoted to constituent service. As recently as 1972 only 1,189 House
employees  --  22.5 percent of House members' personal staffs  --  were based in
home-district offices. By 1992 the number had more than doubled, to 3,128, and
the proportion had nearly doubled, to 42.1 percent. On the Senate side there
were only 303 state-based staffers in 1972, making up 12.5 percent of senators'
personal staffs, but the number had more than quadrupled by 1992 to 1,368, for
fully 31.6 percent of the total. Since a significant proportion of the time of
Washington-based congressional staffs is also devoted to constituent service,
it is a fair guess that more than half of the time of all congressional staffs
is now given over to nursing the district or state rather than to legislation
and policymaking.<p>

Much constituent service is undoubtedly altruistic, inspired by politicians'
sense of duty (and constituents' understandable frustration with an
unresponsive bureaucracy); but at the same time nobody doubts that a large
proportion of it is aimed at securing re-election. The statistics on the
outgoing mail of members of Congress and their use of the franking privilege
point in that direction too. Congressional mailings grew enormously in volume
from some 100 million pieces a year in the early 1960s to more than 900 million
in 1984  --  nearly five pieces of congressional mail for every adult American.)
New restrictions on franking introduced in the 1990s have made substantial
inroads into that figure, but not surprisingly the volume of mail emanating
from both houses of Congress is still invariably higher in election years.<p>

The monetary costs of these increases in voter-oriented congressional
activities are high: in addition to being the most heavily staffed legislative
branch in the world, Congress is also the most expensive. But there is another,
nonmonetary cost: the staffs themselves become one of the congressman's or
senator's constituencies, requiring management, taking up time, and always
being tempted to go into business for themselves. American scholars who have
studied the burgeoning of congressional staffs express concern about their
cumulative impact on Congress as a deliberative body in which face-to-face
communication between members, and between members and their constituents,
facilitates both mutual understanding and an understanding of the issues.
Largely in response to the requirements of electioneering, more and more
congressional business is conducted through dense networks of staffers. <p>

One familiar effect of American politicians' vulnerability is the power it
accords to lobbyists and special-interest groups, especially those that can
muster large numbers of votes or have large amounts of money to spend on
campaigns. Members of Congress walk the electoral world alone. They can be
picked off one by one, they know it, and they adjust their behavior
accordingly. The power of the American Association of Retired Persons, the
National Rifle Association, the banking industry, and the various veterans'
lobbies is well known. It derives partly from their routine contributions to
campaign funds and the quality of their lobbying activities in Washington, but
far more from the votes that the organizations may be able to deliver and from
congressmen's and senators' calculations of how the positions they take in the
present may affect their chances of re-election in the future  --  a future that
rarely is distant. Might a future challenger be able to use that speech against
me? Might I be targeted for defeat by one of the powerful lobbying groups? <p>

A second effect is that American politicians are even more likely than those in
other countries to engage in symbolic politics: to use words masquerading as
deeds, to take actions that purport to be instrumental but are in fact purely
rhetorical. A problem exists; the people demand that it be solved; the
politicians cannot solve it and know so; they engage in an elaborate pretense
of trying to solve it nevertheless, often at great expense to the taxpayers and
almost invariably at a high cost in terms of both the truth and the
politicians' own reputations for integrity and effectiveness. The politicians
lie in most cases not because they are liars or approve of lying but because
the potential electoral costs of not lying are too great.<p>

At one extreme, symbolic politics consists of speechmaking and public
position-taking in the absence of any real action or any intention of taking
action; casting the right vote is more important than achieving the right
outcome. At the other extreme, symbolic politics consists of whole government
programs that are ostensibly designed to achieve one set of objectives but are
actually designed to achieve other objectives (in some cases simply the
re-election of the politicians who can claim credit for them).<p>

Take as an example the crime bills passed by Congress in the 1980s and 1990s,
with their mandatory-minimum sentences, their three-strikes-and-you're-out
provisions, and their extension of the federal death penalty to fifty new
crimes. The anti-drug and anti-crime legislation, by the testimony of judges
and legal scholars, has been at best useless and at worst wholly pernicious in
its effects, in that it has filled prison cells not with violent criminals but
with drug users and low-level drug pushers. As for the death penalty, a simple
measure of its sheer irrelevance to the federal government's war on crime is
easily provided. The last federal offender to be put to death, Victor H.
Feguer, a convicted kidnapper, was hanged in March of 1963. By the end of 1995
no federal offender had been executed for more than thirty years, and hardly
any offenders were awaiting execution on death row. The ferocious-seeming
federal statutes were almost entirely for show.<p>

The way in which the wars on drugs and crime were fought cannot be understood
without taking into account the incessant pressure that elected officeholders
felt they were under from the electorate. As one former congressman puts it,
"Voters were afraid of criminals, and politicians were afraid of voters." This
fear reached panic proportions in election years. Seven of the years from 1981
to 1994 were election years nationwide; seven were not. During those fourteen
years Congress passed no fewer than seven major crime bills. Of those seven,
six were passed in election years (usually late in the year). That is, there
was only one election year in which a major crime bill was <i>not</i> passed,
and only one non-election year in which a major crime bill <i>was</i> passed.<p>

Another effect of the extreme vulnerability of American politicians is that it
is even harder for them than for democratically elected politicians in other
countries to take tough decisions: to court unpopularity, to ask for
sacrifices, to impose losses, to fly in the face of conventional wisdom  --  in
short, to act in what they believe to be their constituents' interest and the
national interest rather than in their own interest. Timothy J. Penny, a
Democrat who left the House of Representatives in 1994, put the point starkly,
perhaps even too harshly, in <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/
ISBN=0316699128/theatlanticmonthA/"><i>Common Cents</i></A> (1995). 
<blockquote>Voters routinely punish lawmakers who try to do unpopular things,
who challenge them to face unpleasant truths about the budget, crime, Social
Security, or tax policy. Similarly, voters reward politicians for giving them
what they want  --  more spending for popular programs  --  even if it means wounding
the nation in the long run by creating more debt.</blockquote>America's
enduring budget deficit offers a vivid, almost textbook illustration. For
nearly a generation  --  ever since the early 1980s  --  American politicians have
bemoaned the deficit and exhorted themselves to do something about it. However,
they have never done nearly enough, even in their own eyes. Why? Part of the
answer undoubtedly lies in genuine ideological differences that make it hard
for conservatives and liberals to compromise; but much of the answer also lies
in the brute fact that every year in the United States is either an election
year or a pre-election year, with primaries and threatened primaries
intensifying politicians' electoral concerns. In 1985 Senator Warren Rudman, of

MORE DEMOCRACY, MORE DISSATISFACTION
</a></h3>
</center>

<font size=5><img src="../../../dropcaps/N-small.gif" align=left height=44
alt="N"></font>UMEROUS opinion polls show that millions of Americans are profoundly
dissatisfied with the functioning of their political system. Consequently,
there is a widespread disposition in the United States  --  at all levels of
society, from the grass roots to the editorial conference and the company
boardroom  --  to want to make American democracy "work better," and concrete
proposals abound for achieving this goal.<p>

The proposed reforms can be grouped loosely under four headings. First come
those that if implemented would amount to the creation of electronic town
meetings, taking advantage of technological developments such as CD-ROM,
interactive cable systems, electronic mail, and the Internet. <i>The Wall
Street Journal</i> referred in this general connection to "arranging a marriage
of de Tocqueville and technology."<p>

Second, and related, are proposals for promoting democratic deliberation and
citizen participation. <A HREF="http://www.kettering.org/kettering.html">
The Kettering Foundation</A> and the Public Agenda
Foundation already organize National Issues Forums that embrace some 3,000
educational and civic groups across America. David Mathews, the president of
the Kettering Foundation, considers these modern forums to be directly linked
to America's ancient "town meeting tradition." <A HREF="http://www.cpn.org/
sections/partisans/perspectives/new_democrat/rebuild_search.html">Benjamin R. 
Barber</A>, a political
philosopher at Rutgers University, would go further and create a nationwide
network of neighborhood assemblies that could take actual decisions on strictly
local matters and also debate and lobby on broader national questions. <A HREF=
"http://web-cr01.pbs.org/nic/fishkin.html">James S.Fishkin</A>, a political
 scientist at the University of Texas, likewise seeks to
leap the modern barriers to face-to-face democracy by means of what he calls
"deliberative opinion polls" (which have been tried, with considerable success,
in England).<p>

The third group of proposed reforms is equally radical but more old-fashioned.
This group seeks to complete the work of Progressive Era reformers by extending
to the federal level the characteristic state-level reforms that were
introduced in that period: the referendum, the initiative, and the recall. The
political analyst Kevin Phillips, for example, suggests that "the United States
should propose and ratify an amendment to the Constitution setting up a
mechanism for holding nationwide referendums to permit the citizenry to
supplant Congress and the president in making certain categories of national
decisions." He would also like to see congressmen and senators be subject to
popular recall once they have been in office for a year. Certainly proposals of
this kind have broad public support. Depending on the precise wording of the
question, more than 50 percent of Americans support the idea of national
referenda and more than 80 percent support both the initiative and the
recall.<p>

Finally, many commentators  --  and the majority of the American public  --  strongly
back the newest and most fashionable item on the "making democracy work better"
agenda: the imposition of term limits on both state and federal elected
officials, notably members of Congress. But the great majority of those who
favor term limits, true to the American democratic tradition, are less
concerned with good government and the public interest as such than with the
present generation of politicians' alleged lack of responsiveness to the mass
of ordinary people. At the center of this argument is the idea that the United
States is now governed by an unresponsive, self-perpetuating, and increasingly
remote class of professional politicians, a class that ought to be replaced as
soon as possible by "citizen legislators"  --  men and women who will serve the
people simply because they <i>are</i> the people. As one advocate of term
limits puts it, ordinary people  --  the proposed citizen legislators of the
future  --  "know things about life in America that people who have lived as very
self-important figures in Washington for thirty years have no way of knowing or
have forgotten." <p>

Some of the items on this four-part shopping list of reforms are intrinsically
attractive, or at least a good case can be made for them. Nevertheless, taken
as a whole, the mainstream reformist agenda, with its traditional American
emphasis on agency democracy and its view of politicians as mere servants of
the people's will, rests on extremely tenuous conceptual foundations and, more
important, is almost certainly inappropriate as a response to the practical
needs of turn-of-the-century America. America's problem of governance is not
insufficient responsiveness on the part of its elected leaders. On the
contrary, America's problem is their hyper-responsiveness. Politicians do not
need to be tied down still further, to be subjected to even more external
pressures than they are already. Rather, they need to be given just a little
more political leeway, just a little more room for policy maneuver. Reforms
should seek to strengthen division-of-labor democracy, not to create a still
purer form of American-style agency democracy.<p>

alt="I"></font>F the reformist prescriptions are bad ones, there may be something wrong with
the reformist diagnoses on which they are based. What <i>are </i>the principal
sources of dissatisfaction with the current state of American democracy? <p>

Many commentators have gotten into the habit of blaming Americans'
dissatisfaction, in an almost knee-jerk fashion, on "the Vietnam War and
Watergate." It is certainly the case that evidence of widespread
dissatisfaction began to appear during and shortly after Vietnam and Watergate.
<i>Post hoc, ergo propter hoc? </i>Maybe. But in the first place, Vietnam and
Watergate led to a flowering of idealism as well as cynicism (and to the
election, in 1974, of the "Watergate babies," one of the most idealistic and
public-spirited cohorts ever to be elected to Congress). And in the second
place, it seems strange to attribute the dissatisfactions of the 1990s to
events that took place in the 1960s and early 1970s. <table align=left border=0 width=180 hspace=10 vspace=5>

</table>That distance in time is
roughly that between the two world wars; most of today's college students were
not yet born when President Richard Nixon resigned. To be sure, subsequent
scandals have undoubtedly (and deservedly) damaged the reputations of the White
House and Congress, but at least some of the sleaze of recent years has come
about because politicians need such enormous sums to finance their re-election
campaigns. <p>

Two other hypotheses can be dismissed, or at least assigned little importance.
One is that politicians today are a poor lot compared with the intellectual and
moral giants of the past. It probably is the case that having to run scared all
the time has tended to drive some able people out of politics and to discourage
others from coming in. But the phenomenon is a relatively recent one, and for
the time being there is no reason to think that the average congressman or
senator is in any way inferior to his or her predecessors. The quality of
America's existing political class is at most a small part of the problem.<p>

The same is almost certainly true of the idea that divided government  --  in which
one party controls one or both houses of Congress while the other controls the
presidency  --  is to be preferred. Divided government has characterized America
for most of the past thirty years, and it has been associated with some of the
more spectacular political and policy failures of that period  --  the Iran-contra
scandal of the 1980s (which arose out of a Republican Administration's desire
to circumvent a Democratic Congress), and successive shutdowns of parts of the
government as Presidents and Congress have failed to agree on timely taxing and
spending measures. Other things being equal, divided government is probably to
be regretted.<p>

All the same, it is hard to credit the idea that Americans' disillusionment
with their politics would be significantly less today if party control had been
mainly undivided over the past thirty years. On the one hand, recent periods in
which the government has not been divided (the Carter years, 1977-1980, and the
first two Clinton years, 1993-1994)were not notably successful (Carter never
surmounted the energy crisis, and Clinton failed to reform America's
health-care system even though that reform had figured prominently in his
campaign promises). On the other hand, as David R. Mayhew, a political
scientist at Yale University, has shown, periods of divided government have
often been extremely productive in legislative terms. On balance, divided
government appears to be more of a nuisance and a distraction than a root cause
of either the government's difficulties or the public's disillusionment.<p>

The idea that the system suffers from the excessive power of interest groups,
however, needs to be taken seriously. Jonathan Rauch, in his recent book
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0812926323/
theatlanticmonthA/"><i>Demosclerosis</i></A>, argues persuasively that America's interest groups have
become larger, more numerous, and more powerful over the past three decades, to
the point that they now have the capacity to prevent the government from doing
almost anything that would disadvantage or offend any of the clients they
represent  --  taking in, as it happens, virtually the whole American population.<p>

Rauch is probably right; but one needs to go on to ask, as he himself does,
what the power of these pullulating and all-encompassing lobby groups is based
on. The answer is straightforward: their power depends ultimately on their
money, on their capacity to make trouble for elected officials, on the votes of
their members (the AARP has more than 30 million members), and on elective
politicians' fear of not being re-elected. The groups' power, in other words,
depends on politicians' electoral vulnerability; and America's interest groups
are peculiarly powerful in large measure because America's elective politicians
are peculiarly vulnerable. It is not quite as simple as that  --  but almost.<p>

It is also important to note the precise timing of the developments described
by Rauch and by almost everyone else who has written on this subject. Nearly
all these developments date, almost uncannily, from the past thirty years: the
rise in the number of interest groups, the growth in their membership and
power, the decline in the public's trust in government officials, and the
increased sense among voters that who they are and what they think do not
matter to politicians and officials in Washington. In other words, the origins
of the present era of democratic discontent can be traced to the end of the
1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. It was then that people began to think
something was wrong not with this or that aspect of the system but with the
system itself.<p>

What happened at that time? It is hard to escape the conclusion that the
crucial developments, largely provoked by the Vietnam War and Watergate, were
the attempts from 1968 onward to open up the American system, to make it more
transparent, to make it more accessible, to make it, in a word, more
"democratic." These attempts led to an increase in the number of primary
elections, to a further weakening of America's already weak political parties,
to increases in the already high costs of electoral politics, and to the
increasing isolation, in an increasingly hostile environment, of elective
officials. In short, the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate reforms led, as they were
meant to lead, to increased vulnerability to their electorates on the part of
individual American officeholders.<p>

The paradox that has resulted is obvious and easily stated. Recent history
suggests that when large numbers of Americans become dissatisfied with the
workings of their government, they call for more democracy. The more they call
for more democracy, the more of it they get. The more of it they get, the more
dissatisfied they become with the workings of their government. The more they
become dissatisfied with the workings of their government, the more they call
for more democracy. The cycle endlessly repeats itself.<p>

<a name="RTFToC6">WHAT, IF ANYTHING, MIGHT BE DONE?
</a></h3>
</center>

<font size=5><img src="../../../dropcaps/P-small.gif" align=left height=44
alt="P"></font>RECISELY because American politicians are so exposed electorally, they
probably have to display  --  and do display  --  more political courage more often
than the politicians of any other democratic country. The number of political
saints and martyrs in the United States is unusually large. <p>

There is, however, no special virtue in a political system that requires large
numbers of politicians to run the risk of martyrdom in order to ensure that
tough decisions can be taken in a timely manner in the national interest. The
number of such decisions that need to be taken is always likely to be large;
human nature being what it is, the supply of would-be martyrs is always likely
to be small. On balance it would seem better not to try to eliminate the
electoral risks (it can never be done in a democracy) but to reduce somewhat
their scale and intensity. There is no reason why the risks run by American
politicians should be so much greater than the risks run by elective
politicians in other democratic countries.<p>

How, then, might the risks be reduced?  What can be done?  A number of 
reforms to the existing system suggest themselves.  It may be that none of 
them is politically feasible -- Americans hold tight to the idea of agency 
democracy -- but in principle there should be no bar to any of them.  One 
of the simplest would also be the most radical: to lengthen the terms of 
members of the House of Representatives from two years to four.  The 
proposal is by no means a new one: at least 123 resolutions bearing on the 
subject were introduced in Congress in the eighty years from 1885 to 1965, 
and President Lyndon B.  Johnson advocated the change in his State of the 
Union address in January of 1966.  <p>

A congressman participating in a Brookings Institution round table held at
about the time of Johnson's message supported the change, saying, "I think that
the four years would help you to be a braver congressman, and I think what you
need is bravery. I think you need courage." Another congressman on the same
occasion cited the example of another bill that he believed had the support of
a majority in the House. "That bill is not going to come up this year. You know
why it is not coming up? . . . Because four hundred and thirty-five of us have
to face election. . . . If we had a four-year term, I am as confident as I can
be the bill would have come to the floor and passed."<p>

A similar case could be made for extending the term of senators to eight years,
with half the Senate retiring or running for re-election every four years. If
the terms of members of both houses were thus extended and made to coincide,
the effect in reducing America's never-ending election campaign would be
dramatic.<p>

There is much to be said, too, for all the reasons mentioned so far, for
scaling down the number of primary elections. They absorb extravagant amounts
of time, energy, and money; they serve little democratic purpose; few people
bother to vote in them; and they place additional and unnecessary pressure on
incumbent officeholders. Since the main disadvantage of primaries is the
adverse effect they have on incumbents, any reforms probably ought to be
concerned with protecting incumbents' interests.<p>

At the moment, the primary laws make no distinction between situations in which
a seat in the House or the Senate is already occupied and situations in which
the incumbent is, for whatever reason, standing down. The current laws provide
for a primary to be held in either case. An incumbent is therefore treated as
though the seat in question were open and he or she were merely one of the
candidates for it. A relatively simple reform would be to distinguish between
the two situations. If a seat was open, primaries would be held in both
parties, as now; but if the incumbent announced that he or she intended to run
for re-election, then a primary in his or her party would be held only if large
numbers of party supporters were determined to have one  --  that is, were
determined that the incumbent should be ousted. The obvious way to ascertain
whether such determination existed would be by means of a petition supervised
by the relevant state government and requiring a considerable number of
signatures. The possibility of a primary would thus be left open, but those who
wanted one would have to show that they were both numerous and serious. A
primary would not be held simply because an ambitious, possibly demented,
possibly wealthy individual decided to throw his or her hat into the ring.<p>

Any steps to strengthen the parties as institutions would be desirable on 
the same grounds.  Lack of party cover in the United States means that 
elective officeholders find it hard to take tough decisions partly because 
they lack safety in numbers.  They can seldom, if ever, say to an aggrieved 
constituent or a political-action committee out for revenge, "I had to vote 
that way because my party told me to,"or even "I had to vote that way 
because we in my party all agreed that we would." Lack of party cohesion, 
together with American voters' disposition to vote for the individual 
rather than the party, means that congressmen and senators are always in 
danger of being picked off one by one.<p> <br><br>

alt="W"></font>HAT might be done to give both parties more backbone? Clearly, the parties
would be strengthened  --  and elective officeholders would not need to raise so
much money for their own campaigns  --  if each party organization became a major
source of campaign funding. In the unlikely event (against the background of
chronic budget deficits) that Congress ever gets around to authorizing the
federal funding of congressional election campaigns, a strong case could be
made for channeling as much of the money as possible through the parties, and
setting aside some of it to cover their administrative and other ongoing 
costs.<p>

The party organizations and the nexus between parties and their candidates
would also be strengthened if it were made easier for ordinary citizens to give
money to the parties and for the parties to give money to their candidates.
Until 1986, when the program was abolished, tax credits were available for
taxpayers who contributed small sums to the political parties. These credits
could be restored.<A HREF="http://fermi.clas.virginia.edu/~ljs/sabbio.html">
Larry J. Sabato</A>, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, has similarly suggested that citizens entitled to a tax refund could
be allowed to divert a small part of their refund to the party of their choice.
Such measures would not, however, reduce candidates' dependence on donations
from wealthy individuals and PACs unless they were accompanied by measures
enabling the parties to contribute more generously to their candidates'
campaigns. At the moment there are strict legal limits on the amount of money
that national or state party organizations can contribute to the campaigns of
individual candidates. The limits should be raised (and indexed to inflation).
There is even a case for abolishing them altogether.<p>

All that said, there is an even more straightforward way of reducing
incumbents' dependence on campaign contributors. At present incumbents have to
spend so much time raising funds because the campaigns themselves are so
expensive. They could be made cheaper. This, of course, would be one of the
effects of making U.S. elections less numerous and less frequent than they are
now. Another way to lower the cost of elections would be to provide candidates
and parties with free air time on television and radio. <p>

<a name="RTFToC8">THE CASE FOR SWANS
</a></h3>
</center>

<font size=5><img src="../../../dropcaps/C-small.gif" align=left height=44
alt="C"></font>LEARLY, the idea of term limits also needs to be taken seriously. After all,
if American politicians are excessively vulnerable at the moment, one way of
rendering them invulnerable would be to prevent them from running for
re-election  --  no impending election contest, no need to worry overmuch about the
voters.<p>

As is evident, much of the actual campaigning in favor of term limits takes the
form of ranting  --  against big government, against Washington, against "them,"
against taxes, against the deficit. Much of the rhetoric of term-limiters is
sulfurous, and their principal motive often seems to be revenge. They claim
that members of Congress are insufficiently responsive to their constituents,
when the evidence suggests that, on the contrary, they are far too responsive.
The term-limits movement is of a piece with previous outbursts of frustrated
American populism, including the Know-Nothing movement of the 1850s  --  an essay,
as one historian has put it, in "the politics of impatience."<p>

Nevertheless, there is an alternate case for term limits, based not on American
politicians' alleged lack of responsiveness to the voters but on their alleged
overresponsiveness to the voters and interest groups in order to secure their
own re-election. The most persuasive and subtle advocate of this line of
argument is the political commentator George F. Will. His goal, Will says
partway through his book <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/
ISBN=0029347130/
theatlanticmonthA/"><i>Restoration</i></A> (1992), "is deliberative democracy
through representatives who function at a constitutional distance from the
people." He reiterates the point about distance in his final paragraphs:
"Americans must be less demanding of government. They must give to government
more constitutional space in which to think, more social distance to facilitate
deliberation about the future."<p>

The case for giving American politicians more space and distance is undoubtedly
a strong one, but assuming these objectives are desirable, it is still not
clear that term limits are a suitable means for achieving them. Three questions
arise. Would term limits achieve the desired objectives? Would they do so at an
acceptable cost in terms of other American goals and values? Might the desired
objectives not be better achieved by other means? The first question is
strictly empirical. The other two mix the empirical and the moral.<p>

One way in which term limits might promote deliberation is by causing some
incumbent legislators  --  namely those serving out their final term under term
limits  --  to think, speak, and vote differently from the way they would have
thought, spoken, and voted if they had been eligible and running for
re-election. In addition, for term limits to affect the behavior not just of
certain individuals but of Congress as a whole, it would be necessary for any
given Congress to contain a significant number of these final-term members. In
other words, congressional lame ducks would have to quack differently from
other ducks, and there would have to be a fair number of them on the pond.<p>

It is impossible to be sure, but it seems unlikely that term limits would have
significant effects along these lines. In the first place, existing research
(along with most human experience)suggests that a final-term congressman or
senator, after eleven or twelve years on Capitol Hill, would be unlikely to
alter his pattern of behavior in any radical way. He might send out fewer
pieces of franked mail and make fewer trips back home, but he would probably
not execute many U-turns in the way he spoke and voted. In the second place,
although the proportion of senators who would be in their final term under term
limits would normally be large (possibly half if senators were restricted to
two terms), the proportion of lame-duck congressmen would normally be much
smaller (an average of sixty to seventy out of 435 if House members were
limited to six terms). The cumulative impact of the lame ducks would thus be
much greater in the Senate than in the House, and in both houses it would
probably be felt mainly at the margins (though of course the margins can, on
occasion, be important).<p>

But those who advocate term limits in fact build very little of their case on
the expected future behavior of lame ducks. Rather, they are seeking to create
a wholly new class of elected representatives. George Will holds out the
prospect that mandatory term limits would have the effect of replacing today's
political careerists with noncareerists  --  in other words, of replacing today's
ducks with creatures more closely resembling swans. The new legislators,
because they were not careerists, would not be driven by the need to secure
re-election, and for that reason they would be more likely to concern
themselves with the national interest. Also because they were not political
careerists, they would be more likely to have some personal, hands-on
understanding of America and its real concerns.<p>

The prospect is undoubtedly attractive. But is it realistic? Would term
limits in fact diminish the number of careerists and produce legislators who
were more national-minded and disinterested?<p>

The most important difficulties with Will's hypothesis are twofold. One is that
modern politics at all levels, local and state as well as national, is an
immensely time-consuming, energy-consuming activity that demands enormous
commitment from those who are attracted to it. Legislative sessions are long,
constituents' demands are exigent, policy problems are increasingly
complicated. As a result, politics all over the world, not just in the United
States, is becoming professionalized. Men and women in all countries
increasingly choose a political career at an early age and then stick with it.
It seems likely that even under term limits the great majority of congressmen
and senators would be drawn from this professional political class, which has
not only the commitment to politics but also the requisite patience, skills,
and contacts. To be sure, people's political careers would take a different
shape; but they would still be political careers. <p>

The other difficulty is the reverse of the first. Just as politics is becoming
more professionalized, so is almost every other occupation. As many women in
particular know to their cost,<table align=left border=0 width=180 hspace=10 vspace=5>

</table> it is becoming harder and harder to take
career breaks  --  those who jump off the ladder in any profession find it
increasingly hard to jump back even to the level they were on when they left,
let alone the level they would have attained had they stayed. For this reason
it is hard to imagine that many upwardly mobile corporate executives or
successful professionals or small-business owners would take time off to serve

this basis would probably be largely the rich and the old.<p>

<font size=5><img src="../../../dropcaps/D-small.gif" align=left height=44
alt="D"></font>ESPITE their differences, term limits and the proposals offered here have in
common the fact that they seek major changes in America's political
institutions  --  in some cases involving an amendment to the Constitution. But of
course America's politicians are free to alter the way they behave in the
context of the country's existing institutions. They can try to find
alternative ways of insulating at least some aspects of policymaking from the
intense campaigning and electioneering pressures they are now under. <p>

Short of taking difficult issues out of electoral politics altogether, there
are tactics that could be employed. Most of them are out of keeping with the
contemporary American preferences for direct democracy, high levels of
political participation, and the maximum exposure of all political processes to
the public gaze; but that is precisely their strength. Bismarck is reputed to
have said that there are two things one should never watch being made: sausages
and laws. Both should be judged more by the end result than by the precise
circumstances of their manufacture.<p>

One available tactic might be called "the collusion of the elites." There may
be occasions on which the great majority of America's politicians, in both the
executive and legislative branches, are able to agree that an issue is of such
overriding importance to the nation that it must be dealt with at almost any
cost; that the politicians involved must therefore be prepared to set aside
their ideological and other differences in the interests of finding a workable
solution; and that having found a solution, they must stick together in
presenting it to what may well be a disgruntled or even hostile electorate. In
order to be successful, the collusion-of-elites tactic requires not only a
substantial degree of bipartisanship (or, better still, nonpartisanship) but
also unusually small teams of negotiators, complete secrecy (not a single ray
of "sunshine" must penetrate the proceedings), and the presentation to Congress
and the public of a comprehensive, all-or-nothing, take-it-or-leave-it
proposal.<p>

The number of occasions on which politicians will be prepared to set aside
their ideological differences and pool their political risks in this fashion
will inevitably be small. There were no signs that such a spirit might prevail
when President Clinton and the Republican majorities in Congress wrangled over
how to cut the budget deficit last winter. But there have been instances of the
successful collusion of elites, even in relatively recent times.<p>

One of them occurred in 1983, when representatives of President Reagan and the
two party leaderships on Capitol Hill colluded to save the Social Security
system, which at that time was in imminent danger of bankruptcy. Paul Light's
classic account of the 1983 Social Security reform, <A HREF="http://www.
amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0075544857/theatlanticmonthA/"><i>Artful Work</i>
</A>
(1985),is in effect a case study of how to conduct collusion-of-elites politics
and of the circumstances in which it may succeed. The so-called Gang of
Seventeen that was originally put together to hammer out a deal (and was later
reduced to a Gang of Nine) excluded all the more-extreme ideologues and met in
circumstances of great secrecy, even using, according to one participant,
"unmarked limos."<p>

Of the Gang of Seventeen's activities, Light writes,
<blockquote>The meetings seemed to inaugurate a new form of
presidential-congressional government. The meetings were secret. There were no
minutes or transcripts. All conversations were strictly off the record. The
gang was free to discuss all of the options without fear of political
retaliation. It . . . [existed] completely outside of the constitutional
system. </blockquote>
Ultimately, as Light relates, the "secret gang built a
compromise, wrapped it in a bipartisan flag, and rammed it through Congress.
There was no other way to move. It was government by fait accompli." It was
also successful government  --  and none of the participants suffered electoral
damage.<p>

Another possible tactic, with many similarities to the collusion of elites,
might be called "putting it into commission." If taking tough decisions is too
risky politically, then get someone else to take them. If someone else cannot
be found to take them, then make someone else <i>appear</i> to take them. The
someone else need not be but usually will be a bipartisan or nonpartisan
commission of some kind.<p>

Such a commission, the National Commission on Social Security Reform, played a
role in the passage of the 1983 act, but an even better example was the
procedure adopted by Congress in 1990 for closing redundant military bases.
Earlier practice had been almost a caricature of Congress's traditional
decision-making process. The Secretary of Defense would propose a program of
base closures. Senators and congressmen would immediately leap to the defense
of targeted bases in their home states or districts. They of course had the
support of their colleagues, who were threatened with or feared base closures
in <i>their</i> home states or districts. Almost never did anyone manage to
close any bases.<p>

Realizing that the process was absurd and that huge sums of taxpayers' money
were being wasted in keeping redundant bases open, Congress decided to protect
itself from itself. It established the Defense Base Closure and Realignment
Commission, which employed an extraordinarily simple formula. The Defense
Secretary every two years published a list of the bases he proposed to close,
together with a statement of criteria he had used in compiling his list. The
commission then examined the list in light of the criteria, held public
hearings, and recommended a modified list (with additions as well as deletions)
to the President. The President was obliged to accept the commission's list as
a whole or reject it as a whole. If, as invariably happened, he accepted it,
Congress could intervene only if within forty-five legislative days it passed a
bill overriding the President's decision and rejecting the whole list. This it
never did.<p>

The formula was a near miracle of voter-proofing. Members of Congress were left
free to protest the closure of bases in their home districts or states, but the
decision was ultimately taken by the President, who could nonetheless ascribe
all blame to the commission, and all Congress had to do for the President's
decision to take effect was to do nothing. In the event, hundreds of bases were
closed and millions of dollars saved, but no member of Congress ever had to
vote  --  and be seen by his constituents to be voting  --  in favor of closing a base
near home. Beyond any question the results were in America's national interest.
<p>

It is not wholly fantastic to suppose that the President in odd-numbered years
might, on the basis of advice received from a bipartisan commission, announce a
list of "program eliminations," which Congress could countermand only by voting
to reject the list as a whole. Presidents would probably prefer to put forward
such lists at the beginning of their first term in office  --  or at any time
during their second term  --  when they, at least, were not up for re-election.<p>

A final tactic, which could also be adopted without major institutional change,
might be described as "thinking big." Proposals that are put forward on a
piecemeal basis can also be opposed, and in all probability defeated, on a
piecemeal basis. In contrast, large-scale, broad-based proposals may have a
better chance of success simply by virtue of their comprehensiveness. They can
provide something for everyone  --  conservatives as well as liberals, deficit
cutters as well as program defenders, residents of the Sun Belt as well as of
the Rust Belt. Gains as well as losses can be broadcast widely. The 1983 Social
Security reform and the 1986 tax reform were certainly "big thoughts" of this
general type. So, in its way, was the recent base-closure program.<p>

Tactics like these  --  the collusion of elites, putting issues into commission,
and thinking big  --  all have their virtues, but they also suffer from being
tactics in the pejorative as well as the descriptive sense. At bottom they are
somewhat cynical devices for getting around the real difficulty, which is the
hyper-responsiveness of American politicians that is induced by their having to
run scared so much of the time. Although it would be harder, it would be better
over the long term to confront this problem directly and try to bring about at
least some of the fundamental institutional changes proposed here. The American
people cannot govern themselves. They therefore need to find appropriate means
of choosing representatives who can do a decent job of governing on their
behalf, and that means giving the people's representatives space, time, and
freedom in which to take decisions, knowing that if they get them wrong, they
will be punished by the voters. In twentieth-century America the airy myths of
agency democracy are precisely that:myths. What America needs today, though it
does not seem to know it, is a more realistic and down-to-earth form of
division-of-labor democracy.<p><br>

<b><FONT SIZE="5">A</FONT>nthony King agrees with the argument in your book
 <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0812926323/theatlanticmonthA/">
<i>Demosclerosis</i></a> that the American system suffers greatly from the excessive
power of special-interest groups. What, if anything, can the government do to 
break -- or even just weaken -- the vice-grip of these groups?</b><p>

<br>
You can't break the grip but you can weaken it somewhat. For one, you can use
trade to expose domestic groups to foreign competition. Second, you can create a big 
package of changes that will sweep away
deeply entrenched groups. There has to be national leadership coming from the
President in order for this to happen. We did this successfully in the 1986 Tax
Reform under Reagan. It seems to be getting harder to do, but the idea is that
if you push a bunch of special-interest groups over the cliff at once and produce 
enough of a reward for the taxpayers, citizens may be willing to let you do it. But 
it takes great ambition. The basic answer is that you treat this problem but don't cure
it.<p>

<br>

<b>What explains the recent growth of the special interests' power and
influence?</b><p>

<br>

Remember that these things are as old as democracy. James Madison
wrote about special-interest groups in <i>The Federalist Papers</i>. He called it the
"power of faction." There's nothing new about this. What <i>is</i> new is that
in the last thirty to thirty-five years there has been an astounding proliferation 
and sophistication of these groups. What was initially just informal groups of 
people coming to Washington to ask for things is now a huge
and rapidly growing professional sector.<p>
 
A lot of things have caused this. One is technology, of course, which makes 
communication and organization much easier. Another is Washington itself, which has
become much bigger and has therefore attracted entrepreneurial interests. A third is 
the maturation process of a democracy in which economic theory gives us good reason
to expect the strengthening of special-interest groups. Lastly, the
reforms of the 1970s opened up Congress so that instead of a few powerful
people receiving lobbyists we had lots of independent entrepreneurs doing business.
We suddenly had a huge bidding war, with 535 people vying for campaign
money from special-interest groups.<p>

<br>

<b>King mentions that the Vietnam War and Watergate were crucial in increasing
the strength of political-action groups. Would you agree?</b><p>

<br>

There's something to that, but I think it is a fairly minor factor. What
Vietnam and Watergate did was help destroy the public's confidence in
government itself. But I think the institutional forces that I mentioned are
more central.<p>

<b><FONT SIZE="5">A</FONT>nthony King asserts, "Lack of party cohesion, together with American
voters' disposition to vote for the individual rather than the party, means
that congressmen and senators are always in danger of being picked off one by
one." Do you agree? </b><p>

<br>

King is right on the mark. Of course this is the most dramatic
difference between the government of the United States and a government, such as
the United Kingdom's, that is under a parliamentary system. But let
me point out that the two-party caucuses in each house of the American Congress
are showing greater cohesion now than at any time since the beginning of this
century. A larger proportion of the members of each caucus -- Democratic and
Republican -- are voting identically to the other members on a greater
percentage of votes than at any time in the better part of a century. We've
reversed the slide toward chaos that appeared to be accelerating in the 1970s.
This is generally to the good. There is a downside however: there are fewer
liberal Republicans and fewer conservative Democrats, which means it's more
difficult to achieve compromise and consensus. <p>

<br>

<b>What might be done to strengthen political parties?</b><p>

<br>

I believe strongly that parties can be strengthened neither by action of
the Congressional caucuses nor, at the national level, by active party
committees. The way to strengthen parties is to reconnect individual voters to
their local parties. We need to make parties relevant to average peoples'
lives; parties must be involved in delivering services to citizens. They need
to acquire a constituency-delivery capability that can compete with what
members of Congress currently have. That's the way for parties to become
competitive again. They'll matter more to citizens when they serve the
citizenry in a direct and tangible way.<p>

<br>

<b>King acknowledges your point that citizens entitled to a tax refund could be
allowed to divert a small part of their refund to the party of their choice as
a way to strengthen parties.</b><p>

<br>

Absolutely. But again, why would citizens do that? Most citizens will not
even consider doing that until they regard the party as being relevant to their
lives.<p>

<font size=5><img src="../../../dropcaps/A-small.gif" align=left
height=44 alt="A"></font>MERICA has three living winners of the Nobel Peace
	Prize, two
universally renowned and the other so little celebrated that not one
person in a hundred would be likely to pick his face out of a police lineup, or
even recognize his name. The universally known recipients are Elie Wiesel, who
for leading an exemplary life has been justly rewarded with honor and acclaim,
and Henry Kissinger, who in the aftermath of his Nobel has realized wealth and
prestige. America's third peace-prize winner, in contrast, has been the subject
of little public notice, and has passed up every opportunity to parley his
award into riches or personal distinction. And the third winner's
accomplishments, unlike Kissinger's, are morally unambiguous. Though barely
known in the country of his birth, elsewhere in the world Norman Borlaug is
widely considered to be among the leading Americans of our age.<p> <br>

Borlaug is an eighty-two-year-old plant breeder who for most of the past five
decades has lived in developing nations, teaching the techniques of high-yield
agriculture. He received the <a
href="http://www.almaz.com/nobel/peace/1970a.html">Nobel in 1970</a>,
primarily for his work in reversing
the food shortages that haunted India and Pakistan in the 1960s. Perhaps more
than anyone else, Borlaug is responsible for the fact that throughout the
postwar era, except in sub-Saharan Africa, global food production has expanded
faster than the human population, averting the mass starvations that were
widely predicted  --  for example, in the 1967 best seller <I>Famine --
1975!</I> The form
of agriculture that Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion
deaths.<p> <br>

Yet although he has led one of the century's most accomplished lives, and done
so in a meritorious cause, Borlaug has never received much public recognition
in the United States, where it is often said that the young lack heroes to look
up to. One reason is that Borlaug's deeds are done in nations remote from the
media spotlight: the Western press covers tragedy and strife in poor countries,
but has little to say about progress there. Another reason is that Borlaug's
mission  --  to cause the environment to produce significantly more food
--  has come
to be seen, at least by some securely affluent commentators, as perhaps better
left undone. More food sustains human population growth, which they see as
antithetical to the natural world. <p> <br>

The Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and the World Bank, once sponsors of his
work, have recently given Borlaug the cold shoulder. Funding institutions have
also cut support for the International Maize and Wheat Center -- located in
Mexico and known by its Spanish acronym, <A
HREF="http://www.cgiar.org/cimmyt/">CIMMYT</A>
  --  where Borlaug helped to
develop the high-yield, low-pesticide dwarf wheat upon which a substantial
portion of the world's population now depends for sustenance. And though
Borlaug's achievements are arguably the greatest that Ford or Rockefeller has
ever funded, both foundations have retreated from the last effort of Borlaug's
long life: the attempt to bring high-yield agriculture to Africa.<p><br>

The African continent is the main place where food production has not kept 
pace with population growth: its potential for a Malthusian catastrophe is 
great.  Borlaug's initial efforts in a few African nations have yielded the 
same rapid increases in food production as did his initial efforts on the 
Indian subcontinent in the 1960s.  Nevertheless, Western environmental 
groups have campaigned against introducing high-yield farming techniques to 
Africa, and have persuaded image-sensitive organizations such as the Ford 
Foundation and the World Bank to steer clear of Borlaug.  So far the only 
prominent support for Borlaug's Africa project has come from former <a 
href="http://www.emory.edu/CARTER_CENTER/PUBS/G2000/g2-feedg.htm">President 
Jimmy Carter</a>, a humanist and himself a farmer, and from the late 
mediagenic multimillionaire Japanese industrialist Ryoichi Sasakawa.<p>

Reflecting Western priorities, the debate about whether high-yield agriculture
would be good for Africa is currently phrased mostly in environmental terms,
not in terms of saving lives. By producing more food from less land, Borlaug
argues, high-yield farming will preserve Africa's wild habitats, which are now
being depleted by slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture. Opponents argue that
inorganic fertilizers and controlled irrigation will bring a new environmental
stress to the one continent where the chemical-based approach to food
production has yet to catch on. In this debate the moral imperative of food for
the world's malnourished -- whether they "should" have been born or not, they
must eat -- stands in danger of being forgotten. <p>

alt="N"></font>ORMAN BORLAUG was born in Cresco, Iowa, in 1914. Ideas being
tested in Iowa
around the time of his boyhood would soon transform the American Midwest into
"the world's breadbasket," not only annually increasing total production -- so
methodically that the increases were soon taken for granted -- but annually
improving yield, growing more bushels of grain from the same amount of land or
less. From about 1950 until the 1980s midwestern farmers improved yields by
around three percent a year, more than doubling the overall yield through the
period. This feat of expansion was so spectacular that some pessimists declared
it was a special case that could never be repeated. But it has been done again,
since around 1970, in China. <p>

Entering college as the Depression began, Borlaug worked for a time in the
Northeastern Forestry Service, often with men from the Civilian Conservation
Corps, occasionally dropping out of school to earn money to finish his degree
in forest management. He passed the civil-service exam and was accepted into
the Forest Service, but the job fell through. He then began to pursue a
graduate degree in plant pathology. During his studies he did a research
project on the movement of spores of rust, a class of fungus that plagues many
crops. The project, undertaken when the existence of the jet stream was not yet
known, established that rust-spore clouds move internationally in sync with
harvest cycles -- a surprising finding at the time. The process opened
Borlaug's
eyes to the magnitude of the world beyond Iowa's borders.<p>

At the same time, the Midwest was becoming the Dust Bowl. Though some mythology
now attributes the Dust Bowl to a conversion to technological farming methods,
in Borlaug's mind the problem was the lack of such methods. Since then American
farming has become far more technological, and <a href="http://www.usnews.com/
usnews/issue/dust.htm">no Dust Bowl conditions have
recurred</a>. In the summer of 1988 the Dakotas had a drought as bad as
that in the
Dust Bowl, but clouds of soil were rare because few crops failed. Borlaug was
horrified by the Dust Bowl and simultaneously impressed that its effects seemed
least where high-yield approaches to farming were being tried. He decided that
his life's work would be to spread the benefits of high-yield farming to the
many nations where crop failures as awful as those in the Dust Bowl were
regular facts of life. <p>

In 1943 the Rockefeller Foundation established the precursor to CIMMYT to
assist the poor farmers of Mexico, doing so at the behest of the former
Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace, of the Pioneer Hi-Bred seed company
family, who had been unable to extract any money from Congress for agricultural
aid to Mexico. Soon Borlaug was in Mexico as the director of the wheat
program -- a job for which there was little competition, backwater Mexico
in the
1940s not being an eagerly sought-after posting. Except for brief intervals, he
has lived in the developing world since.<p>

The program's initial goal was to teach Mexican farmers new farming ideas, but
Borlaug soon had the institution seeking agricultural innovations. One was
"shuttle breeding," a technique for speeding up the movement of disease
immunity between strains of crops. Borlaug also developed cereals that were
insensitive to the number of hours of light in a day, and could therefore be
grown in many climates.<p>

Borlaug's leading research achievement was to hasten the perfection of dwarf
spring wheat. Though it is conventionally assumed that farmers want a tall,
impressive-looking harvest, in fact shrinking wheat and other crops has often
proved beneficial. Bred for short stalks, plants expend less energy on growing
inedible column sections and more on growing valuable grain. Stout,
short-stalked wheat also neatly supports its kernels, whereas tall-stalked
wheat may bend over at maturity, complicating reaping. Nature has favored genes
for tall stalks, because in nature plants must compete for access to sunlight.
In high-yield agriculture equally short-stalked plants will receive equal
sunlight. As Borlaug labored to perfect his wheat, researchers were seeking
dwarf strains of rice at the International Rice Research Institute, in the
Philippines, another of the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations' creations, and at
China's Hunan Rice Research Institute. <p>

Once the Rockefeller's Mexican program was producing high-yield dwarf wheat for
Mexico, Borlaug began to argue that India and other nations should switch to
cereal crops. The proposition was controversial then and remains so today, some
environmental commentators asserting that farmers in the developing world
should grow indigenous crops (lentils in India, cassava in Africa) rather than
the grains favored in the West. Borlaug's argument was simply that since no one
had yet perfected high-yield strains of indigenous plants (high-yield cassava
has only recently been available), CIMMYT wheat would produce the most food
calories for the developing world. Borlaug particularly favored wheat because
it grows in nearly all environments and requires relatively little pesticide,
having an innate resistance to insects.<p>

CIMMYT's selectively bred <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/html/cgiar/press/
wheat3.html">wheat</a>, no longer a wholly natural plant, would not
prosper without fertilizer and irrigation, however. High-yield crops sprout
with great enthusiasm, but the better plants grow, the more moisture they
demand and the faster they deplete soil nutrients. Like most agronomists,
Borlaug has always advocated using organic fertilizers -- usually manure -- to
restore soil nutrients. But the way to attain large quantities of manure is to
have large herds of livestock, busily consuming the grain that would otherwise
feed people. Inorganic fertilizers based on petroleum and other minerals can
renew soil on a global scale -- at least as long as the petroleum holds
out. <p>

<p>

<font size=5><img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif" align=left height=44
alt="T"></font>O Borlaug, the argument for high-yield cereal crops,
inorganic fertilizers,
and irrigation became irrefutable when the global population began to take off
after the Second World War. But many governments of developing nations were
suspicious, partly for reasons of tradition (wheat was then a foreign substance
in India) and partly because contact between Western technical experts and
peasant farmers might shake up feudal cultures to the discomfort of the elite
classes. Meanwhile, some commentators were suggesting that it would be wrong to
increase the food supply in the developing world: better to let nature do the
dirty work of restraining the human population.<p>

Yet statistics suggest that high-yield agriculture brakes population growth
rather than accelerating it, by starting the progression from the
high-birth-rate, high-death-rate societies of feudal cultures toward the
low-birth-rate, low-death-rate societies of Western nations. As the former
Indian diplomat Karan Singh is reported to have said, "Development is the best
contraceptive." In subsistence agriculture children are viewed as manual labor,
and thus large numbers are desired. In technical agriculture knowledge becomes
more important, and parents thus have fewer children in order to devote
resources to their education. <p>

In 1963 the Rockefeller Foundation and the government of Mexico established
CIMMYT, as an outgrowth of their original program, and sent Borlaug to Pakistan
and India, which were then descending into famine. He failed in his initial
efforts to persuade the parastatal seed and grain monopolies that those
countries had established after independence to switch to high-yield crop
strains. <p>

Despite the institutional resistance Borlaug stayed in Pakistan and India,
tirelessly repeating himself. By 1965 famine on the subcontinent was so bad
that governments made a commitment to dwarf wheat. Borlaug arranged for a
convoy of thirty-five trucks to carry high-yield seeds from CIMMYT to a Los
Angeles dock for shipment. The convoy was held up by the Mexican police,
blocked by U.S. border agents attempting to enforce a ban on seed importation,
and then stopped by the National Guard when the Watts riot prevented access to
the L.A. harbor. Finally the seed ship sailed. Borlaug says, "I went to bed
thinking the problem was at last solved, and woke up to the news that war had
broken out between India and Pakistan."<p>

Nevertheless, Borlaug and many local scientists who were his former trainees in
Mexico planted the first crop of dwarf wheat on the subcontinent, sometimes
working within sight of artillery flashes. Sowed late, that crop germinated
poorly, yet yields still rose 70 percent. This prevented general wartime
starvation in the region, though famine did strike parts of India. There were
also riots in the state of Kerala in 1966, when a population whose ancestors
had for centuries eaten rice was presented with sacks of wheat flour
originating in Borlaug's fields.<p>

Owing to wartime emergency, Borlaug was given the go-ahead to circumvent the
parastatals. "Within a few hours of that decision I had all the seed contracts
signed and a much larger planting effort in place," he says. "If it hadn't been
for the war, I might never have been given true freedom to test these ideas."
The next harvest "was beautiful, a 98 percent improvement." By 1968 Pakistan
was self-sufficient in wheat production. India required only a few years
longer. Paul Ehrlich had written in <A
HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0891908617/theatlanticmonthA/">
<i>The Population Bomb</i></A> (1968) that it was "a
fantasy" that India would "ever" feed itself. By 1974 India was self-sufficient
in the production of all cereals. Pakistan progressed from harvesting 3.4
million tons of wheat annually when Borlaug arrived to around 18 million today,
India from 11 million tons to 60 million. In both nations food production since
the 1960s has increased faster than the rate of population growth. Briefly in
the mid-1980s India even entered the world export market for grains.<p>

Borlaug's majestic accomplishment came to be labeled the <a href="http://www.
indiaserver.com/news/bline/021696bline/BLFP03.html">Green Revolution</a>.
Whether it was really a revolution is open to debate. As Robert Kates, a former
director of the <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/World_Hunger_Program/
">World Hunger Program</a>, at Brown University, says, "If you plot
growth in farm yields over the century, the 1960s period does not particularly
stand out for overall global trends. What does stand out is the movement of
yield increases from the West to the developing world, and Borlaug was one of
the crucial innovators there." Touring the subcontinent in the late 1960s and
encountering field after field of robust wheat, Forrest Frank Hill, a former
vice-president of the Ford Foundation, told Borlaug, "Enjoy this now, because
nothing like it will ever happen to you again. Eventually the naysayers and the
bureaucrats will choke you to death, and you won't be able to get permission
for more of these efforts."<p>

THE HIGH-YIELD BOOM
</H4>
</center>
<p>


<font size=5><img src="../../../dropcaps/F-small.gif" align=left height=44
alt="F"></font>OR some time this augury seemed mistaken, as Borlaug's view
of agriculture
remained ascendant. In 1950 the world produced 692 million tons of grain for
2.2 billion people; by 1992 production was 1.9 billion tons for 5.6 billion
people -- 2.8 times the grain for 2.2 times the population. Global grain yields
rose from 0.45 tons per acre to 1.1 tons; yields of corn, rice, and other
foodstuffs improved similarly. From 1965 to 1990 the globe's daily per capita
intake grew from 2,063 calories to 2,495, with an increased proportion as
protein. Malnutrition continued as a problem of global scale but decreased in
percentage terms, even as more than two billion people were added to the
population.<p>

The world's 1950 grain output of 692 million tons came from 1.7 billion acres
of cropland, the 1992 output of 1.9 billion tons from 1.73 billion acres --
a 170
percent increase from one percent more land. "Without high-yield agriculture,"
Borlaug says, "either millions would have starved or increases in food output
would have been realized through drastic expansion of acres under
cultivation -- losses of pristine land a hundred times greater than all
losses to
urban and suburban expansion."<p>

The trend toward harvesting more from fewer acres, often spun in the media as a
shocking crisis of "vanishing farms," is perhaps the most environmentally
favorable development of the modern age. Paul Waggoner, of the Connecticut
Agricultural Experiment Station, says, "From long before Malthus until about
forty-five years ago each person took more land from nature than his parents
did. For the past forty-five years people have been taking less land from
nature than their parents." <p>

In developing nations where population growth is surging, high-yield
agriculture holds back the rampant deforestation of wild areas. Waggoner
calculates that India's transition to high-yield farming spared the country
from having to plough an additional 100 million acres of virgin land -- an area
about equivalent to California. In the past five years India has been able to
slow and perhaps even halt its national deforestation, a hopeful sign. This
would have been impossible were India still feeding itself with traditionally
cultivated indigenous crops.<p>

BACKLASH

<p>

<font size=5><img src="../../../dropcaps/N-small.gif" align=left height=44
alt="N"></font>ONETHELESS, by the 1980s finding fault with high-yield
agriculture had become
fashionable. Environmentalists began to tell the Ford and Rockefeller
Foundations and Western governments that high-yield techniques would despoil
the developing world. As Borlaug turned his attention to high-yield projects
for Africa, where mass starvation still seemed a plausible threat, some green
organizations became determined to stop him there. "The environmental community
in the 1980s went crazy pressuring the donor countries and the big foundations
not to support ideas like inorganic fertilizers for Africa," says David
Seckler, the director of the <A
HREF="http://www.cgiar.org/iimi/">International Irrigation Management
Institute</A>.<p>

Environmental lobbyists persuaded the Ford Foundation and the World Bank to
back off from most African agriculture projects. The Rockefeller Foundation
largely backed away too -- though it might have in any case, because it was
shifting toward an emphasis on biotechnological agricultural research. "World
Bank fear of green political pressure in Washington became the single biggest
obstacle to feeding Africa," Borlaug says. The green parties of Western Europe
persuaded most of their governments to stop supplying fertilizer to Africa; an
exception was Norway, which has a large crown corporation that makes fertilizer
and avidly promotes its use. Borlaug, once an honored presence at the Ford and
Rockefeller Foundations, became, he says, "a tar baby to them politically,
because all the ideas the greenies couldn't stand were sticking to me."<p>

Borlaug's reaction to the campaign was anger. He says, "Some of the
environmental lobbyists of the Western nations are the salt of the earth, but
many of them are elitists. They've never experienced the physical sensation of
hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in Washington or
Brussels. If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world,
as I have for fifty years, they'd be crying out for tractors and fertilizer and
irrigation canals and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were
trying to deny them these things." <p>

In 1984, at the age of seventy-one, Borlaug was drawn out of retirement by
Ryoichi Sasakawa, who with Jimmy Carter was working to get African agriculture
moving. Carter was campaigning in favor of fertilizer aid to Africa, as he
still does today. The former President had fallen in with Sasakawa, who during
the Second World War had founded the National Essence Mass Party, a Japanese
fascist group, but who in later life developed a conscience. Today the <A
HREF="http://www.spf.org/">Sasakawa
Peace Foundation</A> is a leading supporter of disarmament initiatives;
Carter and
Sasakawa often made joint appearances for worthy causes.<p>

Sasakawa called Borlaug, who related his inability to obtain World Bank or
foundation help for high-yield-agriculture initiatives in Africa. Sasakawa was
dumbfounded that a Nobel Peace Prize winner couldn't get backing for a
philanthropic endeavor. He offered to fund Borlaug in Africa for five years.
Borlaug said, "I'm seventy-one. I'm too old to start again." Sasakawa replied,
"I'm fifteen years older than you, so I guess we should have started
yesterday." Borlaug, Carter, and Sasakawa traveled to Africa to pick sites, and
the foundation Sasakawa-Global 2000 was born. "I assumed we'd do a few years of
research first," Borlaug says, "but after I saw the terrible circumstances
there, I said, 'Let's just start growing.'" Soon Borlaug was running projects
in Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania, and Togo. Yields of corn
quickly tripled; yields of wheat, cassava, sorghum, and cow peas also grew.<p>

Borlaug made progress even in Sudan, near the dry Sahel, though that project
ended with the onset of Sudan's civil war, in 1992. Only Sasakawa's foundation
came forward with more funds, but although well endowed, it is no World Bank.
Environmentalists continued to say that chemical fertilizers would cause an
ecological calamity in Africa.<p>

Opponents of high-yield agriculture "took the numbers for water pollution
caused by fertilizer runoff in the United States and applied them to Africa,
which is totally fallacious," David Seckler says. "Chemical-fertilizer use in
Africa is so tiny you could increase application for decades before causing the
environmental side effects we see here. Meanwhile, Africa is ruining its
wildlife habitat with slash-and-burn farming, which many commentators
romanticize because it is indigenous." Borlaug found that some foundation
managers and World Bank officials had become hopelessly confused regarding the
distinction between pesticides and fertilizer. He says, "The opponents of
high-yield for Africa were speaking of the two as if they were the same because
they're both made from chemicals, when the scales of toxicity are vastly
different. Fertilizer only replaces substances naturally present in the soils
anyway." <p>

In Africa and throughout the developing world Borlaug and most other
agronomists now teach forms of <a href="http://www.waite.adelaide.edu.au
/~halizade/CRCWMS/ipm.html">"integrated pest management,"</a> which reduces
pesticide use because chemicals are sprayed at the most vulnerable point in an
insect's life cycle. Borlaug says, "All serious agronomists know that
pesticides must be kept to a minimum, and besides, pesticides are expensive.
But somehow the media believe the overspraying is still going on, and this
creates a bias against high-yield agriculture." Indonesia has for nearly a
decade improved rice yields while reducing pesticide use by employing
integrated pest management. The use of pesticides has been in decline relative
to farm production for more than a decade in the United States, where the use
of fertilizer, too, has started declining relative to production.<p>

Such developments have begun to sway some of Borlaug's opposition. The
Committee on Sustainable Agriculture, a coalition of environmental and
development-oriented groups, has become somewhat open to fertilizer use in
Africa. "The environmental movement went through a phase of revulsion against
any chemical use in agriculture," says Robert Blake, the committee's chairman.
"People are coming to realize that is just not realistic. Norman has been right
about this all along." One reason the ground is shifting back in his direction,
Borlaug believes, is that the green parties of Europe have been frightened by
the sudden wave of migrants entering their traditionally low-immigration
nations, and now think that improving conditions in Africa isn't such a bad
idea after all.<p>

Supposing that opposition to high-yield agriculture for Africa declines, the
question becomes What can be accomplished there? Pierre Crosson, an
agricultural analyst for the nonpartisan think tank <a
href="http://www.rff.org/">
Resources for the Future</a>,
calculates that sub-Saharan Africa needs to increase farm yields by 3.3 percent
annually for the next thirty years merely to keep pace with the population
growth that is projected. This means that Africa must do what the American
Midwest did. <p>

"Africa has the lowest farm yields in the world and also a large amount of
undeveloped land, so in theory a huge increase in food production could
happen," says John Bongaarts, the research director of the <a href="http://www.
popcouncil.org/">Population Council</a>,
a nonprofit international research organization. "If southern Sudan was parked
in the Midwest, they'd be growing stuff like crazy there now." Practical
problems, however, make Bongaarts think that rapid African yield increases are
"extremely unlikely in the near future." The obvious obstacles are desperate
poverty and lack of social cohesion. When Borlaug transformed the agriculture
of Pakistan and India, those nations had many problems but also reasonably well
organized economies, good road and rail systems, irrigation projects under way,
and an established entrepreneurial ethos. Much of Africa lacks these.<p>

Additionally, African countries often lack a social focus on increasing
agricultural output. Young men, especially, consider the farm a backwater from
which they long to escape to the city. African governments and technical
ministries tend to look down on food production as an old-fashioned economic
sector, longing instead for high-tech facilities that suggest Western prestige
and power. Yet a basic reason that the United States and the European Union
nations are so strong is that they have achieved almost total mastery over
agriculture, producing ample food at ever-lower prices.<p>

An encouraging example of an African government taking a progressive view of
agriculture comes from Ethiopia, where, since the end of its civil war, Borlaug
has run his most successful African project. Visiting Ethiopia in 1994, Jimmy
Carter took Prime Minister Meles Zenawi on a tour of places where Borlaug's
ideas could be tested, and won Zenawi's support for an extension-service
campaign to aid farmers. During the 1995-1996 season Ethiopia recorded the
greatest harvests of major crops in its history, with a 32 percent increase in
production and a 15 percent increase in average yield over the previous season.
Use of the fertilizer diammonium phosphate was the key reform. The rapid yield
growth suggests that other sub-Saharan countries may also have hope for
increased food production.<p>

Whether Africa can increase its food production may soon become one of the
questions of international affairs. It may be one at which, in a decade or two,
Western governments will frantically throw money after a crisis hits, whereas
more-moderate investments begun now might avert the day of reckoning. And one
of the questions of the next century may be whether the world can feed itself
at all.<p>

<font size=5><img src="../../../dropcaps/H-small.gif" align=left height=44
alt="H"></font>IS opponents may not know it, but Borlaug has long warned of
the dangers of
population growth. "In my Nobel lecture," Borlaug says, "I suggested we had
until the year 2000 to tame the population monster, and then food shortages
would take us under. Now I believe we have a little longer. The Green
Revolution can make Africa productive. The breakup of the former Soviet Union
has caused its grain output to plummet, but if the new republics recover
economically, they could produce vast amounts of food. More fertilizer can make
the favored lands of Latin America -- especially Argentina and Brazil -- more
productive. The cerrado region of Brazil, a very large area long assumed to be
infertile because of toxic soluble aluminum in the soil, may become a
breadbasket, because aluminum-resistant crop strains are being developed." This
last is an example of agricultural advances and environmental protection going
hand in hand: in the past decade the deforestation rate in the Amazon rain
forest has declined somewhat, partly because the cerrado now looks more
attractive.<p>

Borlaug continues, "But Africa, the former Soviet republics, and the cerrado
are the last frontiers. After they are in use, the world will have no
additional sizable blocks of arable land left to put into production, unless
you are willing to level whole forests, which you should not do. So future
food-production increases will have to come from higher yields. And though I
have no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed
the population monster is another matter. Unless progress with agricultural
yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery
that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come
before."<p>

But "very strong" progress on yields seems problematic. John Bongaarts
calculates that agricultural yields outside Western countries must double in
the coming century merely to maintain current -- and inadequate -- nutrition
levels. The United Nations projects that human numbers will reach about 9.8
billion, from about 5.8 billion today, around the year 2050. To bring the
entire world's diet in that year to a level comparable to that of the West,
Bongaarts calculates, would require a 430 percent increase in food
production.<p>

Lester Brown, the head of the <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/">Worldwatch
Institute</a>, an environmental
organization, fears that China may soon turn from an agricultural success story
into a nation of shortages. Because much of it is mountainous, China already
uses most of its attractive tillage area, leaving scant room for expansion. Its
remarkable improvements in wheat and rice yields have come in part, Brown
thinks, at the expense of depleting the national water table: irrigation water
may soon become scarce. As newly affluent Chinese consumers demand more chicken
and beef, feeding increased amounts of grain to animals may cause grain
scarcity. If, as some experts project, the Chinese population rises from 1.2
billion to 1.6 billion, yield increases will not bridge the difference, Brown
fears.<p>

Privatization and dwarf rice have enabled China to raise rice yields rapidly to
about 1.6 tons per acre -- close to the world's best figure of two tons. But
recently rice-yield increases have flattened. The International Rice Research
Institute is working on a new strain that may boost yields dramatically, but
whether it will prosper in the field is unknown. Ismail Serageldin, the
chairman of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, in
Washington, D.C., believes that the "biological maximum" for rice yield is
about seven tons per acre -- four times today's average in developing
countries,
but perhaps a line that cannot be crossed. <p>

An important unknown is whether genetic engineering will improve agricultural
yields. Corn is among the highest-yielding plants. "If the high natural
multiples of maize could be transferred by gene engineering to wheat or rice,
there could be a tremendous world yield improvement," Paul Waggoner, of the
Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, says. So far genetic engineering
has not produced any higher-yielding strains, though it does show promise for
reducing pesticide application. Some researchers also think that biotechnology
will be able to pack more protein and minerals into cereal grains. Others,
Borlaug among them, are skeptical about whether yield itself can be engineered.
So far gene recombination can move only single genes or small contiguous gene
units. Borlaug says, "Unless there is one master gene for yield, which I'm
guessing there is not, engineering for yield will be very complex. It may
happen eventually, but through the coming decades we must assume that gene
engineering will not be the answer to the world's food problems."<p>

Today Borlaug divides his time among CIMMYT, where he teaches young scientists
seeking still-more-productive crop strains for the developing world; Texas
A&amp;M, where he teaches international agriculture every fall semester; and
the Sasakawa-Global 2000 projects that continue to operate in twelve African
nations.<p>

Borlaug's Africa project is a private-sector effort run by an obscure Nobel
Peace Prize winner and a former American President whose altruistic impulses
are made sport of in the American press. Its goal is something the West seems
almost to have given up on -- the rescue of Africa from human suffering.
Recently
Western governments have been easing out of African aid, pleading "donor
fatigue," the difficulty of overcoming corruption, and fear of criticism from
the environmental lobby. Private organizations, including Borlaug's, <A
HREF="http://www.greenmoney.com/devcap/crs/">
Catholic Relief Services</A>, and <A
HREF="http://www.heinemann.co.uk/oxfam/">Oxfam</A>,
carry on what's left of the fight.<p>

If overpopulation anarchy comes, it is likely to arrive first in Africa.
Borlaug understands this, and is using his remaining years to work against that
cataclysm. The odds against him seem long. But then, Norman Borlaug has already
saved more lives than any other person who ever lived. <p>

<font size=6>I</font> HAVE on one or two occasions made note in this space of the longstanding
antipathy of the French people toward the infiltration of English words into
their language -- an attitude that has often been backed up with ugly threats and
attempts at legal redress. I have no desire to belabor the issue at this time,
although the past few years have witnessed the most intense level of such
activity since the mid-1980s. <p>

In 1994, for example, France's National Assembly enacted the so-called Loi
Toubon, a law named for its champion, the French Culture Minister, Jacques
Toubon. The law called for a ban, enforceable by fines of up to $1,800 and by
prison terms, on the use of foreign words in business or government
communications, in broadcasting, and in advertising if "suitable equivalents"
existed in French. (A committee had previously been established to draw up
suitable equivalents where none existed; the committee's work has resulted in
the coining of 3,500 new French words, mostly to replace English-language
ones.) France's Constitutional Council, the country's highest judicial body,
eventually weakened the law, applying it only to government documents, but not
before a bill was introduced in the British Parliament that would have
authorized ordinary traffic wardens in Britain to impose stiff fines on the
spot whenever they heard a French word spoken. <p>

The Toubon controversy notwithstanding, last year another language-content law
went into effect in France, mandating that at least 40 percent of all the songs
played on the country's 1,300 FM stations be French songs -- a situation that one
disc jockey compared to asking artists to paint 40 percent of their work in
blue. Nor has French-language chauvinism been limited to France. Last spring in
Quebec the provincial government banned the distribution during Passover of
imported kosher food that had been labeled only in English. As Jews attempted
to celebrate their deliverance from Egypt, the Francophone response amounted,
in effect, to a declaration of "Ils ne passeront pas," Marshal P&eacute;tain's
defiant slogan at Verdun. <p>

<CENTER>
<font size=6><B>. . .</B></font><p>
</CENTER>
<p>

But, as I say, I don't wish to belabor episodes like these. For whereas efforts
to discriminate against English words in French are at once irritating and
futile, a parallel and positive effort by the French simply to promote the
wider use of their language seems to be gathering strength and is, to my mind,
altogether admirable. Why should not speakers of French seek greater worldwide
resonance for the tongue that Anatole France once likened to a woman "so
beautiful, proud, modest, strong, touching, voluptuous, chaste, noble,
intimate, crazy, and good that one loves her with all one's being"? <p>

The <A HREF="http://www.micronet.fr/%7Elanguefr/dlf/">efforts in behalf of French</A> have been advanced along several fronts. One is
demographic: increasing the production of native French-speakers. The French
have for centuries been as worried about their birth rate as the English have
been about their digestion, and in a series of recent public pronouncements
aimed at private-sector initiative, the French Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, has
sought to induce new spasms of fecundity. <p>

A second front involves the work of a once-moribund organization called <A HREF="http://www.pch.gc.ca/PCH/OFFLANGOFF/EOfL/EL01.htm">La
Francophonie,</A> which is made up of France and some fifty former French colonies
and other French-speaking nations. In an effort to boost the group's
international influence, La Francophonie has created the post of general
secretary; its occupant will attempt to mold the membership into a coherent bloc. La Francophonie has also dangled membership before countries
that may hitherto have had only an attenuated experience of French, such as
Bulgaria, Equatorial Guinea, Moldova, and Sao Tome and Principe, all of which
have in fact joined the organization. These countries, lured perhaps by an
expectation of trade advantages, may not represent a force multiplier, as
military strategists like to say, but they do represent a start. (And, to be
fair, a Bulgarian connection does exist. The French word
<i>mac&eacute;doine</i>, meaning "hodge-podge," is derived from the name of the
Balkan region known as Macedonia, whose ethnic diversity is its distinguishing
trait, and whose incorporation into a greater Bulgaria was once hotly desired
by Bulgarian nationalists.) <p>

A year ago, at the biennial meeting of La Francophonie, in Cotonou, Benin,
France's new President, Jacques Chirac, issued a call for French-speakers to
stake a claim on the Internet (the <i>inforoute</i>, he actually called it), a
communications medium that otherwise seems destined to become an
English-language monopoly. In making the case for "linguistic pluralism and
cultural diversity" on the <i>inforoute</i>, Chirac observed that if even
French, which is spoken by some 150 million people -- making it No. 9 in the
world, after Chinese, Hindustani, Russian, English, Spanish, Arabic, Bengali,
and Portuguese -- is faced with uncertain prospects, the situation must be much
worse for smaller languages, which in Chirac's view risk "complete
eradication." <p>

The point is hard to dispute. Some languages manage to maintain a certain
vitality even in death, so great was once their sway. In England the Treasury
Minister was recently subjected to withering scorn when, <i>ex nihilo</i>, he
promulgated an edict prohibiting Latin tag phrases in departmental memoranda.
In Finland -- which, unlike England, was never even a part of the Roman Empire -- a
weekly news program in Latin called <A HREF="http://www.yle.fi/fbc/nuntrium.html"><i>Nuntii Latini</i></A> (<i>News in Latin</i>)
is broadcast on national radio and transmitted worldwide by satellite. Latin's
future is secure. But what about the future of Flemish, Irish, or Inuit, not to
mention Navajo or Topoiyo? <p>

The question is not merely academic. Judging from examples in Howard
Rheingold's <i>They Have a Word For It</i>, exotic languages harbor valuable
conceptual resources, much the way exotic flora harbor commercial ones. The
Tierra del Fuegan word <i>mamihlapinatapei</i>, which connotes "a meaningful
look, shared between two people, expressing mutual unstated feelings," has
potentially broad applications beyond its place of origin. The same could be
said of such words in the language of Easter Island as <i>anga-anga </i>("a
thought, perhaps groundless, that one is being gossiped about, arising from
one's own sense of guilt") and <i>hakamaroo </i>("the act of keeping borrowed
objects until the owner has to ask for them back"). It is perhaps not
surprising that a sophisticated culture on Easter Island seems to have
collapsed under mysterious circumstances. <p>

<p>

That France should attempt to recolonize the world linguistically is surely
more compatible with the aims of a great and confident power than is its
attempt to preserve French as a genetically inviolate hothouse flower. And it
is not hard to see how France, with a little ingenuity, could exert certain
kinds of leverage to advance the spirit of Cotonou -- although, inexplicably, it
has yet to do so. <p>

Not long ago a few dozen demonstrators from Denmark descended on Paris to
denounce France's plans to conduct nuclear testing underneath Mururoa atoll, in
the South Pacific. Even though the Danes deferentially waged their campaign in
the host country's native tongue (their T-shirts carried the slogan CHIRAC,
NON!), which nationalists might have applauded, they were rounded up by the
police and detained at their hotel. A better strategy by the Quai d'Orsay in
this instance would have been to make an offer: France would forever desist
from nuclear testing, everywhere, if in return French were adopted as the
official language of the global environmental movement in all its internal and
external communications -- adopted, that is, by Paix-Verte, Le Club de la Sierre,
Les Amis de la terre, l'Audubon, and all the rest. This is a high-stakes quid
pro quo that the environmentalists would have been seen as churlish to have
refused. <p>

The government of France or one of the country's giant corporate combines
should also buy the Microsoft Corporation and, if possible, one or more of the
major Hollywood studios. The <i>inforoute</i> and the telecommunications
industry generally are driven by the need for content, and there is no reason
that the content could not be at least superficially Gallicized. The dialogue
in most movies would only be improved for being in French; often the titles
(<i>Mission: Impossible</i>) would not even have to change. France easily
commands the resources to become a player. Could Bill Gates be persuaded to
sell his Microsoft shares? To replace his prized compound outside Seattle,
France should offer Gates a new "campuslike" setting outside Paris, perhaps at
Versailles, where he might even find a dwelling commensurate with his apparent
needs.<p>

Finally, the French ought to give some thought to learning how to swim the
English Channel. The characteristics of the English language that have assured
its good fortune -- its outward-looking ambition, its embrace of the new and the
foreign -- are reflected in the fact that of the 760 or so Channel crossings made
thus far, almost all have been made by "Anglo-Saxons" (as the French style
Britons and Americans when lumping them together). Only six have been made by
French swimmers. This is perhaps mere symbolism -- but <i>quelle symbolisme</i>!
<p>

A word of caution to English-speaking peoples: even as we welcome competition
in the open marketplace, we must beware attempts to divide and conquer. Maurice
Druon, the perpetual secretary of the fabled Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise
and therefore one of France's most vociferous language gendarmes, has quietly
suggested in a small journal that circulates among hidebound British elites
that Great Britain set up a forty-member English Academy modeled on the French
one, and that the two academies together take on the "dark tide" of
"Amerenglish." Should such an unlikely eventuality come to pass, I would hope
that Americans would create an academy of their own. At the very least, the
complex process of picking forty representative members -- George F. Will or
Deion Sanders? Gertrude Himmelfarb or Madonna? Vernon Jordan or Mel
Brooks? -- would remind M. Druon of the diverse resources at Amerenglish's
disposal.

<B>	I</FONT></B> would like to congratulate you on a terrific and fresh 
Web site. It is exciting to see businesses and people 
recognizing that the American people are quite capable of 
thinking for themselves about the issues that concern them 
without massive parental support from the experts in 
Washington and the media.  I applaud your effort at bringing 
more common opinions into the discussion about issues that 
affect the everyday person. The American democracy was 
founded on freedoms, and information is the cheapest of them 
all. Give the people the information they need to make an 
intelligent decision, and the government will be surprised at 
the outcome. Congratulations on leading the charge. <P>

<h3>The Production Internship</h3><p>

</center>

<br>


<i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, an award-winning national magazine, offers an internship in its Production Department. The

Production Staff organizes the technical aspects of printing the magazine 

and provides support to the Advertising Sales Department. We gather advertising

material to be printed in the magazine, handle the paperwork associated 

with this, and coordinate the layout of each issue. We're seeking organized,

motivated individuals who would like to learn more about magazine 

publishing and layout.<p>


Interns would work on the following projects:<p>


<UL>



<LI>Working with <i>The Atlantic</i>'s Editorial, Art, Ad Sales, and 

Special Projects Departments, you'll produce monthly aides that help us determine 

the layout of the upcoming issue:<p>



	<OL>





		<LI>Maintain a "mock-up" of the magazine on a bulletin board so that all 

at

		<i>The Atlantic</i> can see the initial layout of the magazine and 

comment on

(and likely pitfalls) of magazine layout and a grasp of standard 

advertising

needs and practices. The internship is unpaid and is available during the 

spring, summer,

and fall. Interns will receive a transportation stipend. We ask for a two- 

to three-day-a-week commitment.<p>

<font size=5>C</font>OMPOSING serious music still seems to be an
un-American activity. Our
composers are caught between rock -- or jazz or Broadway -- and the hardened
repertory of the concert hall. If they aim low, the critics accuse them of
writing bad imitations of good popular music. If they aim high, their music is
dismissed as "European" -- a code word implying that the music is derivative,
abstruse, and snooty. If they aim for the bland accessibility audiences are
willing to tolerate, their music will be played once or twice and then
justifiably forgotten.<p>

What would it take to make American music unequivocally American? Assuming for
the moment that this is desirable, it would take a composer whose work both
addressed a broad public and was serious in its emotional or ethical concerns.
The music would both induce a feeling of national nostalgia, the way Elgar's
does for the English, and envision our brash future. In short, it would
take -- or should have taken -- a <a href="http://www.danbury.lib.ct.us/
org/housaval/ives.html">Charles Ives</a>. Ives has been hailed as the
founding father of American music ever since his <i>Concord Sonata</i> was
first performed, in 1939. Yet the man, the music, and most of all the
contradictory myths surrounding Ives only heighten the suspicion with which
Americans view their native concert music.<p>

Since the 1930s every generation of American composers has reimagined Ives in
its own image. In his fine new biography, <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/
obidos/ISBN=0393038939/theatlanticmonthA/"><i>Charles Ives: A Life With
Music</i></a>, Jan Swafford lists some of Ives's manifestations: the
"Ultra-modernist, the Nationalist, the amateur, the primitive, the atavist, the
neurotic, the sly fabricator of his own myth." Ives has been used to
authenticate everything from cowboy tunes to conceptualism. In one decade Ives
seemed like Whitman; in the next he was compared, by Leonard Bernstein, to
Grandma Moses. A man who had lived most of his life in New York City was
clothed in homespun and pictured on record albums in front of a comfortable
Connecticut summer home made to look like a log cabin. And today he is a
proto-postmodernist. <p>

In art, as in life, it takes two to tango. Different movements in American
music have needed different founding fathers, but Ives's works are a bottomless
grab bag of contradictory achievements and promises. You can find a piece
somewhere to support every mutation of the Ives myth. The early Second
Symphony, Bernstein's favorite, reveals Ives as a nostalgic nationalist and a
lovable bad boy -- and also as a composer in full command of the European
symphonic idiom of Brahms and Dvor&aacute;k. <i>The Unanswered
Question</i> and <i>Central Park in the Dark, </i>with their divided orchestras
moving at different speeds, show us Ives the vanguardist, who not long ago was
typically praised as the forerunner of Karlheinz Stockhausen. Today Ives's
powerful use of hymns in the Fourth Symphony makes him the predecessor of the
"new spirituality" heard in G&oacute;recki's Third Symphony, and his use of
popular materials makes him the progenitor of crossover. Domestic one day,
cosmic the next, delightfully "bad," transcendentally "good" -- the mythological
Ives is a trickster god.<p>
<br>
<br>

<font size=5>L</font>AST August the <a href="http://pubs13.bard.edu/
bmf/index.htm">Bard Music Festival</a>, in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York,
presented a rediscovery of Ives, an intensive encounter with his music, the
music of his contemporaries, and the current state of Ives scholarship. The
model of the Ives myth that emerged from the festival's panels might be called
Ives the normal. The academic pendulum is, predictably, swinging back from the
model of Ives the weird, which prevailed for thirty years, starting in the
1960s, when the professional isolation in which Ives worked (he split his life
between music and the insurance business, where he was a great innovator and
earned a large fortune) made him an honorary grandfather of the counterculture
and every freakout to come. Ives's "abnormality" also had several dark sides
 -- Ives the prevaricator, Ives the homophobe, Ives the misogynist.
Extrapolating
from certain comments by Elliott Carter, who knew Ives in the twenties and
remembered his "adding dissonances" to works he had written earlier, the
musicologist Maynard Solomon in 1987 described Ives as a borderline personality
who chronically lied about his music in order to appear more innovative than he
really was -- a serious charge against the George Washington of music.<p>

The most telling symptom according to subscribers to the weird model was Ives's
apparent obsession with manliness. He dismissed any men he did not like as
sissies or lilies or just girls. To the ears of today's scholars these were the
homophobic ravings of a closet case; the charge was further substantiated when
it was learned that Ives broke with his close friend Henry Cowell when Cowell
was arrested for what was then called the corruption of minors. Even if Ives
was not pathological, his letters and other writings showed that for him good
music was a "guy thing" -- a stance that would not endear him to feminists.
Rather than the father of American music, Ives now looked like some
embarrassingly eccentric uncle, the black sheep of the musical family.<p>

J. Peter Burkholder, a professor of musicology at Indiana University and
America's leading Ivesian, was an important member of the Bard program
committee and set out to rehabilitate Ives. Although the issues of homophobia
and misogyny disrupted a few of the panel discussions, the thrust of most
presentations was to place Ives in the musical and psychological mainstream. To
counter Solomon's fatal charge of mendacity, Gayle Sherwood, a musicologist at
the University of Michigan, presented her findings about the birth dates of
Ives's works. Using the dating of manuscript paper and other forensic
techniques, she largely confirmed the composer's own accounts -- though she
admitted that he made some small revisions. Jan Swafford wept as he read the
letter in which Ives reminded his wife of the love they had expressed for each
other as they walked beside the Housatonic River at Stockbridge -- a scene Ives
glowingly re-created in <i>Three Places in New England</i>. Rather than working
in isolation, Ives was shown to be actively involved in getting his music
performed and in aiding other composers, such as Lou Harrison and Henry Cowell.
Ives, we heard, was a loving husband, a doting uncle, an astute businessman.
This year's founding father knew best.<p>

Yet the Ives oeuvre is not quite what meets the eye. I was jolted when Jan
Swafford told me that he did not consider one of my favorite works, the First
Piano Sonata, to be completely the work of Ives. Ives sketched it, Swafford
said, and then, dissatisfied, abandoned it; later, editors such as John
Kirkpatrick and Lou Harrison reassembled some portions and published it as
Ives's work. Swafford was particularly dubious about claims made for the
<i>Universe Symphony</i>, a long-standing project that Ives notated only in a
few fragments, yet one that has recently appeared on a recording and been
hailed by some critics as Ives's masterpiece. Whatever the composer's
intentions toward this project may have been, the claims for it as music for
all of humankind to perform from the mountaintops complement current political
and environmental fantasies. Why not enlist Ives as the founder of cultural
diversity, New Age spirituality, and the green movement? In the huge pile of
his sketches there seems to be a scrap to serve every purpose.<p>

Making Ives's music "normal" is a trickier task. In his several books on Ives,
Burkholder ties the composer's pieces to European and American traditions. He
has tried to demonstrate that Ives's use of hymns, popular songs, and classical
themes, rather than being eccentric, was a deliberate and successful aesthetic
strategy -- a way of expressing the diversity of American society.
Departing even
further from the previous view of the isolated Ives, Burkholder claims that
Ives calculated his music carefully for its intended audience, and that it
expressed the values and experiences of the community in which he was raised.
This is where I begin to roll my eyes. Except for his wife and a few
enthusiasts, most of Ives's contemporaries, in particular local musicians,
assumed that his music was either a bad joke or the work of a crank; Ives was
surprised and disturbed by their incomprehension. One of many oddities about
Ives's music is that for listeners today it vividly re-creates a vanished
rural, patriotic America -- an America that in Ives's own time had no use
for his
music. It's not easy being a nostalgic futurist -- but that's what Ives was.<p>

Perhaps I am just an unreconstructed member of the weird camp. Though the
scholars at the Bard festival closed ranks behind the normal Ives, the concerts
demonstrated over and over again just how marvelously and disturbingly abnormal
Ives's music was in its time and is today. Leon Botstein, the president of Bard
College and one of the directors of the festival, has developed thematic
programming into a form of performance scholarship. Every concert placed Ives's
music in a different context: I could hear the composers who taught Ives and
those who were influenced by him, and I could hear music that seemed to
parallel his in a number of suggestive ways. Ives's music refused, though, to
converse with the polite, adept imitations of Schumann and Brahms by his
American contemporaries, or with the angular, well-etched masterpieces of the
modernists, or with the reductive and oriental devices of the avant-garde.
Messy, sprawling, juvenile, jokey, but also highly evocative and inventive and
quietly tragic -- Ives's music emerged from all the concert contexts just as sui
generis, or weird, as it has always been.<p>
<br>
<br>

<font size=5>W</font>HY are we still rediscovering Ives? Half Thomas
Jefferson and half Huck Finn,
Ives is the progenitor of our national ambivalence toward art music itself. He
seemed to believe that music had to be either sublime or ridiculous. It could
lead either to the spiritual redemption of mankind or to a good laugh -- but it
could not be merely an object of aesthetic contemplation, with no further
purpose. His music resists the context of the classical concert altogether.
More than thirty years ago Leonard Bernstein devoted himself to raising the
reputations of two composers -- Gustav Mahler and Ives. Since that time Mahler's
music has taken its place at the heart of the orchestral repertory, but Ives
still seems an alien presence in the concert hall. Out of his more than 110
songs maybe five or six have entered the recital repertory; the string quartets
and piano sonatas remain occasional novelties; half the orchestral works are
barely played, because they seem either immature, like the First Symphony, or
bizarrely misconceived, like the cacophonous <i>Robert Browning Overture</i>. I
don't think the special status accorded even Ives's finest works can any longer
be explained by their technical difficulty; I believe instead that the ethical
and spiritual images within the music set it against a concert world with which
Ives could never make peace, even though he was a loyal follower of the Boston
Symphony.<p>

Ives's music conjures up idealized alternatives to the concert hall. It
portrays imaginary town meetings, revival services, parades, football games.
Ives was envisioning a civic space in which the music would define a
community -- a community that might contain many musicians and artisans but no
"artists." His music is most effective when it sounds as if it were being
played by amateurs, not by conservatory-trained professionals, and when it
sounds like an improvisation, not a thought-out composition. The illusion is a
most artful one. Ives's compositions, at least the ones he brought to a state
of polished completion, are difficult, fully composed works that demand to be
played by the finest musicians. Yet they seem as embarrassed by their own
artistry as by the artistry of the players who can actually master them. The
members of the audience, too, are meant to feel not like aesthetic onlookers
but like participants. Ironically, the hymns and popular songs that fill his
music and turn listeners into a civic congregation are ever further removed
from our experience: Ives invites us to a communion we are no longer prepared
to attend. And so the immediacy of the music is blurred by our own soft-focus
nostalgia for a lost world.<p>

Where, then, does Ives's music belong? The work of two American composers who
were not played at Bard might have resonated powerfully with Ives's music:
<a href="http://www.zappa.com/">Frank Zappa</a>
and <a href="http://www.mingusmingusmingus.com/">Charles Mingus</a>.
Put <i>The Unanswered Question</i> next to <i>Peaches en Regalia</i>, or
<i>General William Booth Enters Into Heaven</i> alongside <i>Fables of Faubus,
</i> and you would really give an audience a new framework for Ives. Zappa's
songs (more than his "serious" works) would be the perfect mirror for Ives's
adolescent humor, his irrepressible assault on decorum and good taste. <p>

Charles Mingus's music, which may someday seem even greater than that of Ives,
would match the political and religious impulses of Ives's compositions.
Mingus -- who, like Ives, left a huge amount of unfinished music and various
unrealized visionary projects -- similarly composed music out of a passionate
idealism and a powerful sense of history. Like Ives, Mingus often re-created
the music of the past (in his case, pastiches of Jelly Roll Morton or Duke
Ellington) and often placed his music within an imagined church service. Again
like Ives, Mingus found ways of composing music so that it sounded improvised
and often pushed his music to the edge of chaos -- even over the edge, as if to
register a protest against the boundaries of genre and expression. Much of
Ives's music is jazz before the fact -- not in its style or its cultural roots
but in its provisional yet incantatory essence. Just picture Ives at the piano,
trading fours with Mingus on bass -- the White Saint and the Black Saint. The
trickster gods can have many faces.<p>

<font size=5>I</font> OFTEN interrupt friends back from a trip as
they recount just what they ate
and where. "What did you see?" I ask defensively, assuming they're giving me
only the culinary news because I write about food. But on they go, about the
cloud-soft gnocchi they had north of Venice, or the beef braised in beer in
Brussels, or the spring-lamb stew in County Cork -- all in restaurants they
hadn't known about before leaving, whose discovery added mightily to their
holiday pleasures. Food matters on trips, for the non-food-obsessed, too.<p>

I'm very cautious, though, when someone planning a trip asks if I know any good
restaurants. One person's exciting discovery is another's disaster. Even if I
know the city or region well, I reply not with a list of names but with a
series of questions. I like to help people decide what they're really after,
and then think who can best direct them to it--the same thing I do while
traveling. Yes, people who write about food make it their business to collect
inside tips on whose chef bears watching, what landmarks have lost their
luster, and which hole in the wall must not be missed. But those
recommendations could be out of date, and even food critics--especially food
critics--vary widely in their tastes. Serendipity plays a big part in any trip;
here are a few ways I've learned to make your own serendipity.<p>
<br>

<font size=5>B</font>E specific. If you want typical food, don't
just mention to a friend or a
sympathetic stranger at your destination that you want local cuisine. Ask how
many regions of the country are represented in the city's restaurants, and what
the differences are between the various styles of cooking. While following the
response you'll quickly sense which is the person's favorite, and which is
likeliest to be yours.<p>

With few exceptions the first restaurants you'll hear about when you ask for
recommendations will be the fanciest and most famous. If you seek elegant
dining with attentive service, or if you're entertaining on business, pay
attention. If simplest is best and price counts, say so. Your informant will
have to stop and think, and second-tier recommendations are usually of greater
interest.<p>

Do you want to see the people who really live in a place rather than other
tourists, or do you want to try superior native cuisine? The desires can be
incompatible. I often dine where people tell me fashionable and arty types go;
I'm rewarded with good people-watching, but after many such evenings I wind up
with too much smoke in my clothes, too much money charged to my credit card,
and nothing more interesting to eat than smoked salmon and steak frites while I
observe. <p>

The problem with following the in crowd is that locals, especially those who
eat out a lot, want a change from the food their town is known for. So many
people in <a href="http://www.us.stupi.se/Food/">Stockholm</a>, for
instance, told me to go to Fredsgatan 12, a storefront
bistro whose chef has built a reputation as one of the city's best, that I
rearranged my itinerary to accept the only available reservation. The menu,
handwritten in gold on black paper, told me I had come to the kind of
restaurant that uses Asian fruits and Italian pasta and French sauce-making
techniques. The result is a latter-day "Continental cuisine" (the catchall
phrase for French-based food associated with cruise liners and hotel
ballrooms), not at all specific to one small place--as, to my mind, the most
interesting cooking is. The Boss-clad patrons were small consolation: I was
just getting to know and like the traditional uses of herring, brown bread,
lake-caught whitefish, and lingonberries, and I wanted the old but not the
stodgy. After I reconfigured my questions, friends pointed me to Erik's
Bakficka, a cheerful bistro in a central residential neighborhood where the
menu was far less ambitious but recognizably Swedish (a cuisine that, it must
be admitted, includes some stodge). Trendy places and landmark restaurants do
show what the residents of a city are wearing and how they behave; but it's
probably better to save them for a drink before or after dinner.<p>

Naturally, you'll need to consider the source of a recommendation. There are
two schools of thought about asking hotel concierges or front-desk clerks (the
easiest and first choices, besides taxi drivers) where to eat. The cynical view
is that concierges are paid to steer people to certain restaurants, and the
rubes foolish enough to look to them deserve what they'll get--something
packaged and moribund. That's naive. Part of a concierge's basic training is
learning about a wide range of places to eat, including modest hangouts and
ethnic places and new spots. If in Paris, for instance, you say you like fish
and brasseries and wouldn't mind a change from haute cuisine, a concierge might
know to send you to Flora Danica, on the Champs-Elys&eacute;es, which Parisian
friends tell me is the best Danish restaurant outside Denmark, and where, they
say, the salmon grilled on one side is extraordinary. <p>

A recommendation for a hotel restaurant needn't be dismissed out of hand.
Hotels often invest large sums in showpiece restaurants that either just break
even or lose money, and they become magnets not only for resourceless and
unimaginative guests but for clever ones and locals, too. Several of the most
sought-after restaurants in Paris, for instance, are in hotels. The young chef
at Montparnasse 25, in one of the city's two Meridien hotels, is attracting
much attention, and the selection of cheeses there is said to be the best in
Paris. The very grand Plaza Ath&eacute;n&eacute;e has an excellent new chef who
combines classic dishes with nouvelle cuisine, which seems to be in the first
stages of a revival. A consistently difficult reservation to get is a table at
the <a
href="http://www.travel2000.com/h/Europe/France/Paris/decrilpa.fr/1.htm">
H&ocirc;tel de Crillon</a>. <p>

In the United States a marketing strategy for hotel operators is to invite in
an established restaurateur who will attract both visitors and locals. Most
people's choice for the best sushi in San Francisco is Kyo-ya, in the Sheraton
Palace, which is not part of the hotel. The perennially booked <a
href="http://www.kerrymenu.com/Postrio-history.htm">Postrio</a>, owned
by the Los Angeles restaurateur Wolfgang Puck, is installed in the Prescott, a
hotel it has greatly helped by its popularity. One of my favorite restaurants
in the Boston area is <a
href="http://rle-vlsi.mit.edu/people/jphill/foodwine/reviews/rialto">Rialto</a>,
at the Charles Hotel, in Harvard Square, where
Jody Adams cooks Mediterranean-themed dishes and the staff is especially
welcoming. This, too, is an independent restaurant: Michela Larson, a co-owner,
renounced the headaches of her own Michela's for the convenience of working
within a hotel. A few chains, most notably the Four Seasons
 and Meridien, take
special care to make sure their restaurants figure among the city's best, and
can outspend the local competition. If the location is convenient and you need
to entertain, you could well choose your hotel by its restaurant.<p>
<br>

<font size=5>E</font>VEN if you don't come equipped with the phone
numbers of local food experts
(as my colleagues and I try to do), you can easily find some on your own --
just
by walking around. My most fertile ground for restaurant recommendations is the
fruit markets, gourmet shops, and bakeries I invariably stop at. When I see a
shop whose owners take obvious pride in what they do, I ask them where they
like to eat. I don't start with "Can you tell me what the best restaurants are
here?" That almost always elicits the standard tourist list, often of places
the people have heard about but not actually tried. (A significant proportion
of respondents to the Zagat surveys, I'm convinced, report what they've read or
been told is the best restaurant in town rather than rating highly the place
they actually like most.) I ask where they would go with their family if they
didn't feel like cooking. Wine merchants, too, usually know a town's
restaurants inside out, and wine connoisseurs will assure you that they know
far more about food than food experts know about wine.<p>

Not just food and wine merchants are interested in food, of course. If you find
an antiques dealer or a bookseller or a design shop whose taste corresponds
closely to yours, chances are that the owner's taste in restaurants will too.
I've often been steered through accidental meetings and chats to trattorias far
more sympathetic than the ones I heard of from colleagues, whose loyalties are
stronger to particular local restaurateurs than they are to me. When I was
first in Florence, a woman who hand-marbleized paper near the central Mercato
San Lorenzo told me about a restaurant, open for lunch only, with laminated
tables and a big stove in the back where patrons point to the pot that
interests them and are served a plate of one of the two or three stews of the
day. I learned much about just how simple Tuscan food is at that stove (it's
now behind glass, after government inspectors had their way), and I still stop
at Mario out of mixed nostalgia and hunger.<p>

Bringing the conversation around to food can serve to break a tense moment. One
evening, freshly arrived in <a
href="http://copenhagen.now.dk/english/kbh/spise/oversigt.html">Copenhagen</a>,
I was detaining the two women who ran
the city's Alitalia office with a complicated ticketing change. Their
irritation vanished when I asked where to go for my first Danish pastry and
what kind I should order. One of the women said that puffy, buttery,
almond-filled wienerbr&oslash;d more or less kept her living in Denmark, and
enumerated the variations I'd have to try, with pinwheel and pretzel shapes and
jam and hazelnut fillings. The other told me how she had learned to bake new
things for her family, but nothing came close to what she could buy in town.
Long after they should have been on their way home, the women insisted on
leading me most of the way to La Glace, so that I would reach it before it
closed.<p>
<br>

<font size=5>C</font>ASING a joint beforehand is the best way to
avoid disappointment. "I know it
when I see it," a careful eater told me while explaining why he refuses all
advice and instead starts walking around when he hits a new town. A caf&eacute;
described as characteristic and full of neighborhood locals can be dirty and
cramped and sad. Even if the only time you can pass by is in off hours, the
attitude of the staff can be indicative.<p>

I make conversation after asking to look at the menu: That apple tart on the
dessert cart -- who made it, and what's in the crust? The whitefish on the
menu -- is there much whitefish caught around here? These are admittedly
annoying
questions for an employee who was looking forward to a few undisturbed hours;
but someone at a restaurant that cares about the food will usually describe
what's on offer with enthusiasm. I've walked into restaurants where the manager
was screaming at a busboy, and walked out. I also walked into, for example, the
Brasserie de la Poste, in the fancy Sixteenth Arrondissement of Paris, and was
powerfully taken with the group at the one occupied table: the manager, the
three waiters, and two cooks. All of them were smoking, drinking beer, and so
clearly enjoying each other that I knew I wanted to come back.<p>

In the end, serendipity remains a traveler's best friend. Getting lost trying
to find a museum of folk art or naval history or old stamps can lead you to a
place full of locals having a good time; figure out when you can come back, and
book a table. Or stop when you see a hand-lettered sign for some local
specialty -- as I did at the end of a very long drive around the Marches, the
Italian region east of Tuscany. CRESCIONE, the awkward red painted letters read
on a wooden sign that seemed to be built of oversized popsicle sticks. I
vaguely knew crescione to be a puffy filled version of piadina, the region's
famous flatbread, which has lard (my favorite baking fat) in the dough. When I
walked into the roadside shack, I found a dozen rickety tables covered not with
bread dough but with overhanging sheets of smooth, dark-gold hand-rolled pasta,
to be cut into tagliatelle and served with ragu. This pasta would be the
restaurant's last dish, the gray-haired and slow-moving couple I found on the
other side of a big pass-through told me. They were closing for good the
following day, Sunday, after lunch. <p>

It was not yet dinnertime, but the wizened woman who ran the restaurant said
she had to give me a plate of farewell tagliatelle, and started slicing one of
the pasta sheets to ribbons. Naturally, I decided that this would be the best
pasta I would ever taste. And it was -- almost. "Ever" isn't over: I'm
always on
the lookout for another ramshackle roadside sign.

<font size=5>M</font>AKING sense of Cuba's economy is not easy. There's a joke I heard 
when I was
in Havana recently: The CIA sends an agent down to live in Cuba and report back
on the state of the economy. He returns six months later, babbling, and is
carted off to an asylum. "I don't get it," he mutters over and over. "There's
no gasoline, but the cars are still running. There's no food in the stores, but
everyone cooks dinner every night. They have no money, they have nothing at
all -- but they drink rum and go dancing."<p>

It's an economy of loaves and fishes, where things somehow come out of thin
air, ingenuity, and sheer will. It's also an economy that is recovering from
the crisis triggered by the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the collapse
of the socialist bloc. From 1989 to 1993 Cuba's gross domestic product
declined, according to official estimates, by 35 percent. Imports dropped 75
percent, and the deficit reached 33 percent of GDP. Oil imports from Russia
fell from 13 million tons in 1989 to less than 7 million tons in 1992. Cuba not
only had to replace the oil and support it had received from the Soviet Union
but also had to establish an entirely new set of trading partners, because 85
percent of its trade had been with the socialist bloc. Making matters worse was
the U.S. economic embargo.<p>

The Cubans prefer the term "economic blockade" -- not unreasonably, since the
United States does not simply decline to do business with Cuba but directly
interferes in Cuba's trade relations with other countries. <p>

The pettiness of the blockade is striking as one looks at the particulars of
its enforcement over the past several years. A Swedish corporation, for
example, has been prohibited from selling a sophisticated piece of medical
equipment to Cuba because it contains a single filter patented under U.S. law.
Dozens of other transactions between Cuba and foreign corporations -- involving
spare parts for x-ray machines from France, neurological diagnostic equipment
from Japan, parts to clean dialysis machines from Argentina, Italian-made
chemicals for water treatment, and many others -- were likewise prevented by U.S.
law.<p>

But in spite of U.S. harassment and meddling, Cuba has found scores of new
trading partners, and has embarked on joint ventures and foreign-investment
projects with firms from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany,
Great Britain, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Mexico, Russia, Spain, and other
countries as well. These projects range from the construction of five-star
hotels to enterprises in mining, oil exploration, telecommunications, and
biotechnology. And many of the projects are not small. Investment projects
include a $1.5 billion deal with a Mexican telecommunications company, a $500
million nickel-mining venture with a Canadian company, a $500 million mining
deal with an Australian company, and a $500 million textile deal with a Mexican
company. A Monte Carlo-based company built a new terminal in Havana harbor for
cruise ships, which has already opened for business. At last count there were
240 joint ventures in Cuba, involving fifty-seven countries in forty areas of
the economy. The foreign investment projects announced to date total some $5
billion.<p>

For seven years Cuba has been actively investing in new modes of production,
restructuring the economy, and establishing new trade relations around the
globe. Now the investments may be starting to pay off. After five years of a
sinking GDP, the economic decline came to a halt in 1994: Cuba showed a slight
growth in GDP of 0.7 percent. The GDP grew by 2.5 percent in 1995. In the first
half of 1996 (the most recent figures available at the time this magazine went
to press) the GDP was growing at 9.6 percent, with continued annual growth
projected.<p>

<br>

<font size =5>A</font>T the level of daily life the economic recovery is dramatic. In 1989
the Malec&oacute;n, a six-lane seaside highway, had more Chinese Flying Pigeon
bicycles on it than cars. The occasional car would be a tourist taxi, or an
aging Lada (an inexpensive Fiat manufactured in Russia), or a Chevrolet from
the 1950s. Although Cuba's economic infrastructure and basic social
institutions were holding (schools, hospitals, and factories were still
operating), by 1992 and 1993 electrical blackouts occurred in residential areas
for most of the day several days a week. Homes had water for only a few hours a
day. Lack of fuel oil forced factories to cut back production. Buses were rare,
unpredictable, and liable to break down.<p>

Last summer, watching the traffic on the Malec&oacute;n, I could barely believe
I was in Havana. On the street in front of me were a bright-green new Suzuki
Sidekick, a new Mercedes-Benz truck, a new Honda sedan, a new Toyota van -- and a
constant flow of Ladas and '57 Chevies. For those with dollars gasoline was
plentiful. Down the road a bit was a new Fiat dealership. Half the models in
the showroom cost about $12,000; the others, vans and small trucks, were going
for $22,000 or $23,000. A few hundred yards away was a gleaming new hotel, its
massive foyer all marble, with Mozart playing softly. A touch-screen computer
gave information in several languages about services, restaurants, and
shopping. The cheapest rooms were $150 a night, the executive suites $400. And
it was obviously not just a tourist hotel: it had conference rooms and a
business center with computer facilities, fax machines, photocopiers, laser
printers, copies of Cuba's foreign-investment laws, and full-color directories
of banks, hotels, restaurants, government offices -- and anything else one might
need if one were, say, thinking of initiating a joint venture somewhere on the
island.<p>

In Havana some of the new wealth is clearly starting to be felt in the
population generally. On almost every block, it seems, is a freshly painted
house. The discos are jammed every night with both Cubans and foreigners. A
fast-food chain called El R&aacute;pido has sprung up, its patios full of
brightly colored tables crowded with Cubans and foreigners eating hot dogs and
pizza and drinking Cokes.<p>

Even during the worst of the economic crisis Cuba managed to avoid starvation,
or even widespread malnutrition. Indeed, one of the remarkable things about
Cuba's response to the crisis is how the country could keep functioning after
its economy was cut by a third. Basic indicators have held steady throughout
the economic crisis: Cuba's infant-mortality rate in 1989 was about ten per
thousand live births, and life expectancy was seventy-six years -- comparable to
the statistics for the United States and the other Western industrialized
countries. The Cuban infant-mortality rate has even improved slightly since
then -- it's now about nine per thousand live births. The literacy rate is 98
percent, and no measurable homelessness exists. Cuba still has more doctors and
teachers per capita than almost any other country in the world. In a population
of 11 million, more than half a million Cubans hold university degrees.<p>

Media accounts often mention "rationing" as evidence of how desperate Cuba's
post-1990 situation is. In fact Cuba has had "rationing" since thirty-five
years before the crisis began: every person, regardless of income, is entitled
to a basic allotment of food and essentials -- beans, rice, vegetables, fruit,
eggs, meat, soap, cooking oil, cigarettes, gasoline, and so on. Shortly after
the revolution every child up to age seven was guaranteed a liter of milk a day
for twenty-five cents; in the 1980s children up to fourteen, along with the
sick and the elderly, received this entitlement. In 1990 the guarantee of milk
was reduced to include only children seven and under again. Also, through the
1980s parallel markets supplied a range of goods, from bread to wine to meat to
canned food, that could be bought with pesos without restriction. As the
economy sank, these goods went "on the book" (the <i>libreta</i>, or ration
book) or disappeared altogether. Bread was rationed, meat rations shrank,
canned goods were hard to find -- until virtually all goods were available
<i>only </i>through the rationing system, and even some of the guaranteed items
didn't always appear as promised.<p>

There was enough food to get by, but just barely. "We have <i>enough</i>," a
friend of mine said in 1992. "There's food on the table every day; the kids are
going to school. But you want something more once in a while. You want to buy a
Coke, or a new dress. You want to sit in a caf&eacute;, or go dancing, or just
buy a can of something for dinner instead of soaking the beans again and hoping
that the cooking gas will come on before two in the morning." <p>

As the economy plummeted, prostitution returned. With it came painful memories
of the Batista era, when Cuba was a playground for wealthy foreigners, and
money laundering, gambling, and prostitution were among the nation's most
visible economic institutions. The official position in recent years was that
<i>this </i>prostitution was different from <i>that </i>prostitution: <i>that
</i>prostitution was what women did to buy food for their starving infants;
<i>this </i>prostitution reflected a malaise born of boredom and frustration
rather than economic desperation. Hundreds of thousands of tourists were now
flooding the country each year, with their Nikes and Walkmans, jewelry and
credit cards, while Cubans were increasingly standing in long lines to catch
overcrowded buses to go to work at a factory or a university that might shut
down partway through the day because of an electricity shortage. By mid-1994
the peso -- which in principle was equivalent to a dollar -- was trading on the
black market at 120 to a dollar. It was clear that as long as the economic
crisis continued, prostitution, petty theft, and black-market activities would
grow.<p>

Salaries in Cuba can range from 100 pesos a month to a few hundred. A factory
worker might earn 120 pesos a month, a professor 350. Anyone who has completed
a university education will automatically earn at least 195 pesos a month. A
top surgeon might earn as much as 600. It has been common in the past few years
to see in the U.S. press that "Cubans are now living on the equivalent of a
dollar a month." But this misrepresents the nature of the economic situation.
The Cuban economy is simply not structured on the model of dependent
capitalism. Basic necessities, at consistent, easily affordable prices, are
still bought in pesos, regardless of what the exchange rate is. Rent for Cubans
is around six or eight percent of their monthly salary, no matter how much they
earn. All the food provided "on the book" would cost a family of four perhaps
thirty or forty pesos a month. Education continues to be free, medical care is
free, buses cost a few cents. The peso's loss of purchasing power did not mean
that people lost their homes or couldn't afford to send their children to
school. Rather, the economic crisis has meant that nothing except necessities
could be bought with Cuban currency.<p>

The Cuban government responded to the crisis in part by developing trade and
investment and in part by introducing elements of a mixed economy. In September
of 1993 the government announced that the state-run farms would be dismantled
and replaced by worker-managed cooperatives. By the fall of 1994 Cuban fuel
supplies had climbed back up, and the electricity shortages became brief and
infrequent. The Cuban government also legalized the small business enterprises
and farmers' markets. Food prices at these markets vary -- some are affordable
for everyone, some too expensive for anyone not running a private business in
dollars. But the presence of the markets meant that the food shortages were
over -- and, perhaps as important, that the <i>sense </i>of shortage was over.
The monotony of people's diets, the starkness, the sense of being limited to
the goods "on the book," have by now given way to the far more tolerable
project of just managing on a tight budget.<p>

<br>

<font size=5>T</font>HE economic changes in Cuba go to the very structure of the Cuban economy.
Joint ventures have been permitted since 1982, but for many years the foreign
partner could not hold more than a 49 percent share unless there were
exceptional circumstances. In 1992 the Cuban constitution was modified to
recognize a variety of new forms of property. New kinds of foreign investment,
Cuban corporations, and joint ventures were legalized. Foreign corporations
were given the right to repatriate profits freely. The law was modified again
in September of 1995, to permit foreign investment with up to 100 percent
foreign ownership. Foreign investors are guaranteed full protection of their
assets and the right to remove profits in hard currency. And they may also
acquire and develop real estate, although they may not buy or develop
residential properties for Cuban nationals. Foreign investment is permitted in
all sectors of the economy except health, education, and the armed services. 
<p>

Cuba's development strategy in the face of its economic crisis contrasts
sharply with the policies of other countries in Latin America and the Third
World. Typically, foreign investors come to Third World countries because there
are far fewer environmental restrictions and protections for labor than in
First World countries. A textile factory in Haiti can pay its employees twelve
cents an hour. A factory in Cairo can pour untreated pollution into the air
with little or no concern for environmental laws. Cuba, however, is trying to
attract investment without making these tradeoffs. It requires foreign
nationals to include in their investment proposals provisions for waste
disposal and land use consistent with sustainable development. "Look," a Cuban
economist told me, "in the end it means there will be more interest in foreign
investment rather than less. If you build a multimillion-dollar hotel on the
beach at Varadero, you want to have assurances that there won't be any chance
of leaky oil tankers a half mile down, from some company doing oil exploration.
It's one of the advantages of a centralized economy. We can actually make a
company's investment more secure than it would be in an unregulated economy."<p>

Employers can fire unsatisfactory employees and hire new ones through a
government agency, although a worker can challenge a dismissal as unfair or
discriminatory. Foreign companies, like all Cuban enterprises, are prohibited
from discriminating on the basis of race, sex, or ethnicity.<p>

The restructuring has now started to pay off. Furthermore, the increase in GDP
reflects growth that is distributed broadly throughout the economy. In 1995
nickel production increased about 65 percent, tobacco 52 percent, and tourism
20 percent. Exports increased 20 percent, and imports 21 percent. Fifty
thousand new homes are under construction. Cuba's biotechnology industry
competes in the world market, with more than 160 products developed by
fifty-three research centers, ranging from genetically engineered crop seeds
that are disease-resistant to a vaccine for hepatitis B. The level of Cuban
tourism is now greater than it was at its height in pre-revolutionary Cuba. In
1994 Cuba had 617,000 tourists, putting it on a par with Aruba and the U.S.
Virgin Islands. In 1995 the number of tourists was conservatively estimated at
750,000. Income from tourism grew from $165 million in 1989 to more than $850
million in 1994 and to $1 billion in 1995. From January to April of last
year -- the period in which the Cuban-American planes were shot down and the
Helms-Burton bill was passed -- Cuba had 375,000 tourists, an increase of 44
percent from the same period the year before.<p>

To say that Cuba is now inviting free enterprise does not really describe the
country's economic restructuring. For the most part there are two different
kinds of profit-based enterprises in Cuba: very large and very small. Foreign
investors account for the very large, individual Cubans for the very small.
Cubans obtain a license, for which they pay a fee based on the income
anticipated for that type of business. A family might turn its living room into
a small restaurant; someone with a car might start hiring it out as a taxi; a
woman might make traditional Cuban pastries and sell them in her front yard.
Thus there is now a substantial legal "informal sector."<p>

The informal sector in Third World economies typically involves a high degree
of economic insecurity. A highway intersection or a city sidewalk will be
crowded with "entrepreneurs" hawking their wares -- parrots, mangoes, hubcaps,
hood ornaments, U.S. dollars, computer parts, pistachios. On a bad day the
entrepreneur may return home with no earnings at all, and his or her family
will literally go hungry the next day. In Cuba, since everyone is already
guaranteed that an extensive set of basic needs will be met, the income from
the new private enterprises goes almost entirely for consumer goods. In the
living room of a woman who serves dinner for four dollars is a Sony stereo
system with enormous speakers, a new color television, and a VCR. A taxi driver
is wearing a new leather jacket. Children playing at a home where pastries are
sold in the yard are wearing new Nikes. Thus, ironically, for many Cubans
private enterprise feels much the way ideologues of capitalism describe it:
with economic freedom, they say, you are your own person, you earn what you
earn, and you spend it as you like. Yet this is possible in Cuba only because
and insofar as it has remained socialist.<p>

During the 1980s the external debt of Third World countries increased
enormously. In the face of their inability to meet debt-service requirements,
and under pressure from the <A HREF="http://www.imf.org/">International Monetary
 Fund</A> and the World Bank,
many instituted "structural adjustment" programs, selling off any state
enterprises that were profitable and reducing expenditures on food subsidies
and health care for populations that were already living very marginally. The
resulting profits and savings have generally gone not into social investment or
job creation but into what Latin Americans call <i>la deuda impagable
</i> -- "the unpayable debt." After the collapse of the Soviet bloc Cuba's future
did not look bright. If it followed the road of dependent capitalism, it could
expect to end up like Brazil or Guatemala, with pockets of extreme wealth
alongside widespread poverty, starvation, unemployment, and violence -- in short,
Cuba could expect to return to the way it was before the revolution. Instead
Cuba has in seven years restructured its entire economy. But it has done so
while maintaining its commitments to many socialist principles, including the
belief that all members of society are entitled to food, housing, education,
and medical care.<p>

<br>

<font size=5>C</font>UBA'S economic transformation has profound implications for the United
States, particularly the U.S. business community. It is a country of 11 million
people with middle-class tastes and a middle-class lifestyle, hungry for TVs,
VCRs, Cuisinarts, and boom boxes. It has a healthy, stable, highly educated
work force, useful to those seeking to establish complex manufacturing
enterprises. Finally, it is now showing solid annual economic growth, and has
already started investing again in its infrastructure. As the Cuban economy
grows, companies from everywhere in the world -- except the United States -- will
be selling consumer products, running resorts, and investing in agriculture,
tourism, mining, and manufacturing. U.S. firms should not expect that much of
the economic pie will be left for them five years from now -- or even two.<p>

The U.S. embargo has cost Cuba a lot, but it has neither crippled the
Cuban economy nor undermined Castro's leadership. And the embargo not only has
failed to persuade the international community that Cuba should be "punished"
but in fact has isolated <i>us </i>within the world community. The
<A HREF="http://www.torricelli.com/bobbiography.html">Torricelli</A> bill of 1992 and the <A HREF="http://www.usis-canada.usia.gov/helms.
htm">Helms-Burton bill</A> of last year are widely
considered to violate international law, in that they claim jurisdiction
over -- and the right to impose penalties on -- foreign companies that choose to do
business with Cuba. Because of the Torricelli bill the United States has been
condemned by ever larger margins by the United Nations General Assembly each
year since 1992 for interfering in Cuba's trade with other nations. The most
recent vote, last November, was a scathing 138 to 3.<p>

The Helms-Burton bill, which President Clinton signed into law last March, has
alienated U.S. trading partners and allies further. The bill permits U.S.
lawsuits against foreign companies if they make use of any property in Cuba
that was confiscated from anyone who is now a U.S. citizen. If a Cuban
plantation owner emigrated to the United States in 1959, and thirty-five years
later a Spanish company built a hotel on the old plantation site, the
&eacute;migr&eacute;, if a U.S. citizen, can sue the Spanish company in a U.S.
court for "trafficking in confiscated property." Thus the U.S. court is
exercising jurisdiction over actions of a foreign company that took place in a
foreign land, for the benefit of someone who was at the time of his loss a
foreign citizen. Furthermore, the bill denies U.S. entry visas to executives of
foreign companies (and their spouses and children) if their employers do
business in Cuba involving properties that were owned by U.S. nationals prior
to the revolution. The State Department has already denied visas to Canadian
and Mexican business executives along with their families.<p>

Helms-Burton in principle could force corporations from Argentina, Brazil,
Canada, Great Britain, Italy, Mexico, Spain, and other countries simply to
abandon their hotels, mines, and other investments in Cuba or to pay millions
in damages to the prior owners from the 1950s.<p>

Consequently the State Department predicted that the Helms-Burton legislation
would have a "chilling effect" on Cuban commerce. But so far it has not. There
have been few confirmed cases of companies pulling out, and there is every
indication that the economic recovery continues to be solid. Last July, Cuba's
Vice President announced that the nation's GDP for the first six months of the
year grew by 9.6 percent. Even after the devastation done to the crops by
Hurricane Lili in October, the GDP for 1996 is expected to show growth of at
least five percent. Furthermore, Cuba has put in place new laws that will make
foreign investment  even more attractive. Last June, Cuba enhanced foreign
companies' incentives to trade with the island when the National Assembly
passed a law reducing tariffs on imported goods. A few weeks later the National
Assembly passed another law, establishing free-trade zones and industrial
parks, where businesses will receive huge tax breaks.<p>

In recent years the United States has invoked international law to justify both
the Persian Gulf War and the invasion of Panama. However, because of
Helms-Burton now <i>we</i> are being widely condemned for violating
international law and major trade accords such as <A HREF="http://www.auburn.edu
/~vestmon/GATT.html">GATT</A> and <A HREF="http://www.vssp.com/nafta.html">NAFTA
</A>.<p>

Last July, President Clinton tried to stave off the fury of U.S. allies and
trading partners by suspending the implementation of the most controversial
provisions of Helms-Burton for six months, although they are still valid law.
Not surprisingly, our European trading partners have continued to show
"unadulterated, undiluted anger," in the words of Stuart Eizenstat, of the
Commerce Department. Last fall the European Union brought an action against the
United States before the World Trade Organization. This was followed by
retaliatory legislation from all fifteen EU states, prohibiting European
countries from obeying the Helms-Burton provisions and permitting them to
countersue American companies in European courts to recover any financial
penalties imposed by U.S. courts. Canada and Mexico passed retaliatory
legislation as well.<p>

In the meantime, U.S. business is losing out: it is conservatively estimated
that if the Cuban embargo were lifted today, the United States could export
goods worth $1-$2 billion annually to the island. American goods have been
making their way to Cuban consumers by a variety of routes for years -- U.S.
companies sell goods to a non-U.S. distributor, who sells them to Cuba, or the
goods are sometimes just smuggled in. Coca-Cola, California wines, Mr. Clean,
Gerber baby food, Sylvania light bulbs, Quaker Oats  -- all can be found in Cuba.
U.S. companies are clearly eager to set up shop in Cuba. In 1990
representatives of more than 400 U.S. businesses visited Cuba; in 1995, 1,300
businesses visited. General Motors, Sears Roebuck, Avis, Hyatt, ITT Sheraton,
Bank of Boston, Gillette, and Radisson Hotels are among the U.S. companies that
have sent CEOs and representatives to Havana to look into future business
opportunities. Dozens of U.S. firms have already signed letters of intent to do
business if the embargo is lifted. <p>

Up to this point both Congress and Clinton have been more interested in
condemning Castro than in abiding by international law. But the furious
protests from our major trading partners lead one to wonder how long Congress
and the Administration can hold out. In this new game of chicken that we are
playing with Cuba, the smart money in the international business community may
well be on Cuba.<p><br>

<font size=5>I</font>N 1983 the makers of <i>The Day After</i>, a made-for-television movie about
the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust, filmed part of their drama in an
inner-city neighborhood in Kansas City whose forlorn, rubble-strewn landscape
seemed the perfect image of a fictional ground zero. Today that same site is a
development that includes 300 units of low- and moderate-income housing, three
shopping centers, and a library. No new government program brought about this
remarkable transformation; rather, a private local nonprofit organization, the
Community Development Corporation of Kansas City, took the initiative.<p>

The revival of this once-forsaken piece of Kansas City real estate is part of a
little-celebrated but widespread campaign by community and nonprofit
organizations to build low-income housing and revitalize inner-city
neighborhoods across the United States. Unlike conventional government housing
programs, the new housing movement is based in the communities it seeks to
help, relies as much on private as on public funding, and produces homes that
could be mistaken for upscale condos. It aims to engage the poor in improving
their own lives. In an era of hostility to government the community-based
approach to housing has wide political appeal. Along with Senator Carol
Moseley-Braun, of Illinois, and other liberal Democrats, such staunch
Republicans as Senator Kit Bond, of Missouri; Congressman Rick Lazio, of New
York; and even Governor Kirk Fordice, of Mississippi, a rock-ribbed Reagan
conservative, have publicly endorsed the <A HREF="http://www.scn.org/IP/cds/cdc01.htm">community-based housing</A> movement. Yet,
strangely, it has eluded public awareness. It is making a visible impact on
low-income neighborhoods all over the country, but the question remains whether
it can survive, much less conquer the monumental problems of the inner city.<p>

<A HREF="http://www.ppnd.org/cdcs.htm">The movement</A> originated in the 1960s but first took root in the 1970s, when job
and population flight, disinvestment, arson, drugs, crime, and disease were
ravaging many urban neighborhoods. As these destructive forces spread to large
urban public-housing projects, Charles Murray and other conservatives concluded
that government social programs had actually caused the chaos. In the early
1980s the federal government, under President Ronald Reagan, began slashing the
funds available for subsidized housing. <p>

Today the federal government has all but ceased to build low-income housing,
and just last year President Bill Clinton signed a bill that stopped granting
rent subsidies to new applicants. Meanwhile, rising housing costs take ever
larger bites of the limited wages of the working poor: by 1993 one fifth of the
nation's unsubsidized renters paid half or more of their income for shelter. In
this grim context new initiatives in the housing field have become crucial. <p>

In response to the federal retreat from housing, groups of private citizens set
out to create islands of safety and comfort in some of the toughest slums in
the country. There are now about 4,000 local housing organizations in the
United States. Since 1988 they have developed more than 20,000 homes a year for
low-income Americans. In 1994 community-based groups built approximately 40,000
units -- equivalent to the rates of production achieved by the government during
the heyday of public housing. <p>

The organizations that produce and manage low-income housing differ markedly
from the rigid centralized bureaucracies that run most government housing
programs. Community-development corporations, which are chartered nonprofit
associations, figure prominently among the producers of low-income housing.
CDCs were first created in the 1960s, to encourage business activity in
inner-city ghettos, but the vast majority concentrate on housing. <p>

Unlike public housing, community-based housing exists in the private market;
its developers must at least break even in order to survive and carry out their
ambitious agendas. Thus they seek both public and private sources of funding.
In collaborative meetings -- or, occasionally, in dramatic confrontations -- local
housing groups wheedle loans, grants, and free land and utilities from city,
state, and federal officials.<p>

Special kinds of nonprofit organizations, known as intermediaries, raise
private funds and funnel them to hundreds of local housing and community
developers across the United States. By acting as a combination of broker,
credit-rating service, and rich uncle, two large intermediaries have emerged as
powerhouses in the movement. The Local Initiatives Support Corporation, or
<A HREF="http://www.garlic.com/%7Etam/LISC/index.html">LISC</A>, was started by the Ford Foundation as a permanent institution for helping
distressed neighborhoods. James Rouse's <A HREF="http://www.enterprisefoundation.org">Enterprise Foundation,</A> one of the
foremost national housing organizations, founded by the head of the Rouse
Company, an innovative development company, was designed to give the housing
movement economy of scale. Each organization maintains a national headquarters
and multiple branch offices and raises millions of dollars each year from
foundations and corporate donors. (Also, the Neighborhood Reinvestment
Corporation, created by Congress as a public nonprofit corporation, maintains
an extensive network of local housing organizations.) <p>

Both LISC and Enterprise create pools of housing-project deals that they offer
to philanthropists and investors; the intermediaries then monitor the community
groups responsible for the projects to ensure that they perform as promised.
One reason that LISC and Enterprise can persuade businesses to provide capital
to small community organizations is that low-income housing is, generally,
profitable. With the help of tax benefits, especially the Federal Low Income
Housing Tax Credit (which housing developers earn and then sell to investors),
investments yield an average annual return of about 16 percent over fifteen
years. Attracted by such earnings, hard-nosed business investors, including
Warren Buffett, the celebrated financier, have plunged into housing for the
poor. <p>

Some critics dislike all the high finance and charge that community-based
housing is simply a money racket. Old-style champions of public housing and
direct housing subsidies object to the syndication of tax credits and other
development deals, because the transaction costs benefit lawyers and
accountants. Yet in a climate of government reductions and budget cutbacks a
housing system under the direct control of public or semi-public agencies is
simply not a viable alternative. The days of well-funded centralized programs
are not about to return anytime soon.<p>

In fact the combination of self-sufficiency, good management, local control,
and profitability gives the private-public approach to low-income housing a
powerful political appeal that government housing programs never had. Wooed by
LISC and Enterprise, executives of the Weyerhaeuser Company, Hallmark Cards,
Bank of America, and other corporations have become ardent supporters of the
housing movement.<P>
<BR>

<font size=5>T</font>HE best-known nonprofit housing organization is <A HREF="http://www.public.iastate.edu/%7Estu_org/Habitat/HabInternational.html">Habitat for Humanity.</A> Founded
by Millard Fuller, a devout former businessman, in 1976, to witness the
Christian gospel by building simple but adequate housing for the poor, and
often associated with Jimmy Carter, who is probably its most famous supporter,
Habitat organizes volunteers to help low-income people literally build houses
for themselves. Critics dismiss Habitat as insignificant, on the grounds that
its local chapters are highly decentralized and build only a few houses at a
time. But it has some 1,300 local chapters in the United States, and volunteer
work on Habitat projects is increasingly popular, especially among Protestant
congregations. Thus Habitat for Humanity regularly ranks as one of the largest
homebuilders in the United States. <p>

Habitat is national -- indeed, international -- in scope, but regional housing
organizations, working on their own or with community groups, also develop
impressive amounts of low-income housing. Started in Boston at the dawn of the
housing movement, The Community Builders has in the past thirty-three years
developed more than 8,300 units of low- and moderate-income housing. It
currently manages 4,445 units in the northeastern United States, and has about
4,000 more units on the way. In the San Francisco Bay area BRIDGE Housing
Corporation has helped to produce about 7,000 units throughout California over
the past thirteen years. The New York City Housing Partnership, founded in 1982
by David Rockefeller, has worked with private capital and the state and city
governments to build 13,000 new homes in fifty low-income communities
throughout the five boroughs of New York City.<p>

The movement has drawn in organizations whose original purpose was other than
housing. In the sprawling inner-city district made famous by the Rodney King
riots, Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles was started in 1985 to
fight the construction of a giant waste incinerator, but it has since developed
and now manages more than a hundred units of low-income housing. The primary
and still radical goal of the Industrial Areas Foundation, founded by the late
Saul Alinsky, is to organize disenfranchised people so that they can seize
power for themselves; yet the powerful coalitions of church and community
organizations that the IAF has launched also build homes for low-income
citizens in cities such as New York and Baltimore.<p>

Even commercial firms, albeit socially committed ones, build low-income
housing: McCormack Baron &amp; Associates, of St. Louis, a leader among
for-profit residential builders in urban areas, works on large-scale
redevelopment projects across the country. Telesis Corporation, of Washington,
D.C., is administering court-ordered low-income housing developments in Dallas
and Yonkers among its other projects.<p>
<br>

<font size=5>T</font>WO ironclad rules influence the appearance of the new housing. First, the
architecture must not look anything like the uniform barracks and high-rise
slabs of conventional public-housing projects. Second, the buildings must be
well maintained: managers take pride in making quick repairs, and no graffiti
are allowed to mar the walls. Several of the housing groups hire neighborhood
youths as guards and maintenance men to ensure that their property is not
vandalized.<p>

Although cost constraints and the desire to make low-income housing look
inconspicuous give many projects a bland appearance, architects have also
produced stylish buildings that could easily be mistaken for upmarket
residential developments. David Baker has designed two striking low- and
moderate-income condominium projects in San Francisco for BRIDGE: Parkview
Commons, hillside apartments with Mediterranean clay-tile roofs; and Holloway
Terrace, two-story houses with sculptured white-stucco walls. Working in
Boston, Goody, Clancy &amp; Associates used traditional Boston brick and tall
bay windows to make Langham Court, a mixed-income project, fit into the
Victorian South End neighborhood. <p>

Perhaps the best-known architect specializing in low-income housing is Michael
Pyatok, of Oakland, California, who despite small budgets manages to create
comfortable living spaces, safe and inviting interior courts, and attractive
exteriors composed of bays and trellises. His work ranges from James Lee Court,
an apartment block with earth-colored stucco walls decorated with colorful
African patterns, which houses twenty-six formerly homeless families in
Oakland, to what he mockingly calls a "Ralph Lauren-style" suburban development
for mixed incomes in Bellevue, Washington, which looks for all the world like
an exclusive subdivision. <p>

Always struggling with zoning restrictions and the fears of suburbanites,
Pyatok has learned to be clever. In the face of a requirement that each unit
have two parking spaces (although the families could afford one car at most),
Pyatok persuaded a zoning board to allow the extra parking spaces to be used as
a basketball court. To lend a reassuring single-family image to a low-income
multi-family project, he resorted to picket fences, individual entries, and
chimney-like cupolas that hid telltale bunches of ventilation pipes.<p>
<br>

 <font size=5>N</font>EIGHBORS aside, the primary goal is to give poor people themselves a sense of
pride and a stake in the community. To do so, many housing groups promote
homeownership. In Michigan, for example, Kalamazoo Neighborhood Housing
Services coordinates second-mortgage lending programs with down payments as low
as $1,000, offers home-rehabilitation loans, and gives classes to first-time
homeowners in budgeting and repairs. <p>

Other groups, among them The Resurrection Project, in the Pilsen neighborhood
of Chicago, build and sell one- and two-family houses. Suburban ranch houses
have begun to appear in low-income urban neighborhoods, thanks to Habitat for
Humanity, which builds a basic version, and to the Mid-Bronx Desperadoes
(officially, MBD Community Housing Corporation), which sponsored the
construction of classic ranches on Charlotte Street, where both Jimmy Carter
and Ronald Reagan stopped to view the desolation of the South Bronx. <p>

Most housing groups build and sell only a few houses at a time, but East
Brooklyn Congregations, a federation of churches organized by the Industrial
Areas Foundation, has taken a radically different approach. It pioneered the
Nehemiah Plan in the East New York and Brownsville sections of Brooklyn. Named
by Johnny Ray Youngblood, a Brooklyn minister, after the Old Testament prophet
who rebuilt Jerusalem, the Nehemiah Plan aims to construct and sell very
inexpensive homes en masse to the working poor, thus literally building an
entire community of homeowners. Since 1982 East Brooklyn Congregations has
constructed and sold about 2,150 two-story single-family row houses; another
1,250 are in the works.<p>

As a result, an urban Levittown now flourishes in what was one of the poorest
and most troubled parts of New York City. The homeowners -- church members,
former public-housing tenants, and longtime neighborhood
residents -- scrupulously maintain their property. A visitor cannot help being
struck by the contrast between the Nehemiah houses -- whose owners have adorned
them with doves, lions, and other front-gate statuary, manicured front lawns,
and rooftop satellite dishes -- and the anonymous graffiti-scarred high-rise
public-housing projects in an adjoining district. <p>

Some housing advocates slight the Nehemiah Plan for taking a no-frills approach
and creating a low population density in an urban area, but the real-estate
market reflects the popular judgment on the plan and its neighborhoods: row
houses that originally sold for $39,000 to $62,000 are now valued at $125,000.
<p>

Despite their different approaches, the developers of low-income housing share
certain basic assumptions. They fervently believe that their organizations must
be run as competent business enterprises, that their housing developments
should encourage self-sufficiency and self-improvement among the low-income
residents, and that local control is the key to their success.<p>
<br>

<font size=5>S</font>TILL, despite this record of success, the question remains whether the
movement can do more than make a dent in a daunting problem. Skeptics scoff at
the notion that it can solve the rampant problems of the inner city any more
than the government's War on Poverty could during the 1960s. Even people within
the movement complain that some narrowly focused or poorly organized CDCs take
years to build a few units of housing and then do little else. The funding
process is complex and time-consuming: whereas commercial developers generally
obtain financing from one or two lenders, community-based developers may need
the participation of a dozen sources, each with different criteria for
approval. And because of its grassroots nature, the movement has spread
unevenly. It has yet to reach some smaller cities and parts of the South and
Midwest. <p>

People at LISC and Enterprise have responded by training community leaders in
management and planning in order to "build capacity" in local organizations.
There are signs of progress: the number of housing groups that have each
produced more than a hundred units is climbing. If funders would adopt uniform
application forms for loans and grants, the housing movement could streamline
funding. Above all, housing advocates must protect the Low Income Housing Tax
Credit, federal block grants, and other financial sources, which are the
lifeblood of so many housing developments.<p>

Pessimists overlook the role that community-based housing groups can play in
helping to revive inner-city neighborhoods as stable working-class districts.
Having lost population and buildings, inner-city neighborhoods are ripe for
redevelopment. Left to themselves, they will continue to deteriorate or else
gentrify as real-estate developers move in to make a killing. However, upwardly
mobile African-Americans and immigrants who live in or adjacent to depressed
neighborhoods contribute stability and economic resources to the inner city.
Most important, the movement is able to tap the strong desire of many poor
people to overcome the problems of poverty and improve their lot in life.
Wherever it has advanced, the sense of hope and optimism is almost palpable.<p>

In the South Bronx, once an international symbol of urban crime and
devastation, a concerted rebuilding campaign by dozens of housing and community
groups and the city government has created vital neighborhoods completely at
odds with images of despair. On 165th Street stands a grand old apartment
building renovated two years ago by the Morrisania Revitalization Corporation
and renamed Jacquline Denise Davis Court. Today it houses people with very low
incomes; about a third of the residents were homeless prior to moving in. <p>

Despite their poverty, the occupants of this building are engaged in community
life as never before. The tenant association runs its own building patrol and,
from a table in the brightly restored foyer, checks everyone who enters the
front door. The tenants hold bake sales and throw building parties on holidays.
They organized a successful phone-and-mail campaign to persuade the transit
authority to restore bus service in front of the building after a ten-year
hiatus.<p>

Places like Jacquline Denise Davis Court are sprouting up all over the country.
Although often unheralded, these small triumphs are the most powerful argument
for community-based housing. There is new life at the ground zeroes of urban
America.<p>

LITTLE after ten in the morning Mrs. Shaw walked 	across Gopal Maurya's lawn

to his house. It was Saturday, and Gopal was asleep on the couch. The house was

dark. When he first heard the doorbell, the ringing became part of a dream.

Only he had been in the house during the four months since his wife had

followed his daughter out of his life, and the sound of the bell joined somehow

with his dream to make him feel ridiculous. Mrs. Shaw rang the bell again.

Gopal woke confused and anxious, the state he was in most mornings. He was

wearing only underwear and socks, but his blanket was cold from sweat.<p>



He stood up and hurried to the door. He looked through the peephole. The sky

was bright and clear. Mrs. Shaw was standing sideways about a foot from the

door, and appeared to be staring out over his lawn at her house. She was short

and red-haired and wore a pink sweatshirt and gray jogging pants. <p>



"Hold on! Hold on, Mrs. Shaw!" he shouted, and ran back into the living room to

search for a pair of pants and a shirt. The light was dim, and he had

difficulty finding them. As he groped under and behind the couch and looked

among the clothes crumpled on the floor, he worried that Mrs. Shaw would not

wait and was already walking down the steps. He wondered if he had time to turn

on the light to make his search easier. This was typical of the details that

could baffle him in the morning. <p>



Mrs. Shaw and Gopal had been neighbors for about two years, but Gopal had met

her only three or four times in passing. From his wife he had learned that Mrs.

Shaw was a guidance counselor at the high school his daughter had attended. He

also learned that she had been divorced for a decade. Her husband, a successful

orthodontist, had left her. Since then Mrs. Shaw had moved five or six times,

though rarely more than a few miles from where she had last lived. She had

bought the small mustard-colored house next to Gopal's as part of this

restlessness. Although he did not dislike Mrs. Shaw, Gopal was irritated by the

peeling paint on her house and the weeds sprouting out of her broken asphalt

driveway, as if by association his house were becoming shabbier. The various

cars that left her house late at night made him see her as dissolute. But all

this Gopal was willing to forget that morning, in exchange for even a minor

friendship.<p>



Gopal found the pants and shirt and tugged them on as he returned to open the

door. The light and cold air swept in, reminding him of what he must look like.

Gopal was a small man, with delicate high cheekbones and long eyelashes. He had

always been proud of his looks and had dressed well. Now he feared that the

gray stubble and long hair made him appear bereft.<p>



"Hello, Mr. Maurya," Mrs. Shaw said, looking at him and through him into the

darkened house and then again at him. The sun shone behind her. The sky was

blue dissolving into white. "How are you?" she asked gently.<p>



"Oh, Mrs. Shaw," Gopal said, his voice pitted and rough, "some bad things have

happened to me." He had not meant to speak so directly. He stepped out of the

doorway.<p>



The front door opened into a vestibule, and one had a clear view from there of

the living room and the couch where Gopal slept. He switched on the lights. To

the right was the kitchen. The round Formica table and the counters were dusty.

Mrs. Shaw appeared startled by this detail. After a moment she said, "I heard."

She paused and then quickly added, "I am sorry, Mr. Maurya. It must be hard.

You must not feel ashamed; it's no fault of yours."<p>



"Please, sit," Gopal said, motioning to a chair next to the kitchen table. He

wanted to tangle her in conversation and keep her there for hours. He wanted to

tell her how the loneliness had made him fantasize about calling an ambulance

so that he could be touched and prodded, or how for a while he had begun

loitering at the Indian grocery store like the old men who have not learned

English. What a pretty, good woman, he thought.<p>



Mrs. Shaw stood in the center of the room and looked around her. She was

slightly overweight, and her nostrils appeared to be perfect circles, but her

small white Reebok sneakers made Gopal see her as fleet with youth and

innocence. "I've been thinking of coming over. I'm sorry I didn't."<p>



"That's fine, Mrs. Shaw," Gopal said, standing near the phone on the kitchen

wall. "What could anyone do? I am glad, though, that you are visiting." He

searched for something else to say. To extend their time together, Gopal walked

to the refrigerator and asked her if she wanted anything to drink.<p>



"No, thank you," she said.<p>



"Orange juice, apple juice, or grape, pineapple, guava. I also have some

tropical punch," he continued, opening the refrigerator door wide, as if to

show he was not lying.<p>



"That's all right," Mrs. Shaw said, and they both became quiet. The sunlight

pressed through windows that were laminated with dirt. "You must remember,

everybody plays a part in these things, not just the one who is left," she

said, and then they were silent again. "Do you need anything?"<p>



"No. Thank you." They stared at each other. "Did you come for something?" Gopal

asked, although he did not want to imply that he was trying to end the

conversation.<p>



"I wanted to borrow your lawn mower." <p>



"Already?"April was just starting, and the dew did not evaporate until

midday.<p>



"Spring fever," she said.<p>



Gopal's mind refused to provide a response to this. "Let me get you the

mower."<p>



They went to the garage. The warm sun on the back of his neck made Gopal

hopeful. He believed that something would soon be said or done to delay Mrs.

Shaw's departure, for certainly God could not leave him alone again. The garage

smelled of must and gasoline. The lawn mower was in a shadowy corner with an

aluminum ladder resting on it. "I haven't used it in a while," Gopal said,

placing the ladder on the ground and smiling at Mrs. Shaw beside him. "But it

should be fine." As he stood up, he suddenly felt aroused by Mrs. Shaw's large

breasts, boy's haircut, and little-girl sneakers. Even her nostrils suggested a

frank sexuality. Gopal wanted to put his hands on her waist and pull her toward

him. And then he realized that he had.<p>



"No. No," Mrs. Shaw said, laughing and putting her palms flat against his

chest. "Not now." She pushed him away gently.<p>



Gopal did not try kissing her again, but he was excited. <i>Not now</i>,

he thought. He carefully poured gasoline into the lawn mower, wanting to

appear calm, as if the two of them had already made some commitment and there

was no need for nervousness. He pushed the lawn mower out onto the gravel

driveway and jerked the cord to test the engine. <i>Not now, not now,</i> he

thought, each time he tugged. He let the engine run for a minute. Mrs. Shaw

stood silent beside him. Gopal felt like smiling, but wanted to make everything

appear casual. "You can have it for as long as you need," he said. <p>



"Thank you," Mrs. Shaw replied, and smiled. They looked at each other for a

moment without saying anything. Then she rolled the lawn mower down the

driveway and onto the road. She stopped, turned to look at him, and said, "I'll

call."<p>



"Good," Gopal answered, and watched her push the lawn mower down the road and

up her driveway into the tin shack that huddled at its end. The driveway was

separated from her ranch-style house by ten or fifteen feet of grass, and they

were connected by a trampled path. Before she entered her house, Mrs. Shaw

turned and looked at him as he stood at the top of his driveway. She smiled and

waved.<p>



When he went back into his house, Gopal was too excited to sleep. Before Mrs.

Shaw, the only woman he had ever embraced was his wife, and a part of him

assumed that it was now only a matter of time before he and Mrs. Shaw fell in

love and his life resumed its normalcy. Oh, to live again as he had for nearly

thirty years! Gopal thought, with such force that he shocked himself. Unable to

sit, unable even to think coherently, he walked around his house.<p>

<br>



<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/H-small.gif"

align=left height=44 alt="H"></font>

	IS daughter's departure had made Gopal sick at heart for two or three

weeks, but then she sank so completely from his thoughts that he questioned

whether his pain had been hurt pride rather than grief. Gitu had been a

graduate student and spent only a few weeks with them each year, so it was

understandable that he would not miss her for long. But the swiftness with

which the dense absence on the other side of his bed unknotted and evaporated

made him wonder whether he had ever loved his wife. It made him think that his

wife's abrupt decision never to return from her visit to India was as much his

fault as God's. Anita, he thought, must have decided upon seeing Gitu leave

that there was no more reason to stay, and that perhaps, after all, it was not

too late to start again. Anita had gone to India at the end of November -- a

month after Gitu got on a Lufthansa flight to go live with her boyfriend in

Germany -- and a week later, over an echoing phone line, she told him of the guru

and her enlightenment.<p>



Perhaps if Gopal had not retired early from AT&amp;T, he could have worked long

hours and his wife's and daughter's slipping from his thoughts might have been

mistaken for healing. But he had nothing to do. Most of his acquaintances had

come by way of his wife, and when she left, Gopal did not call them, both

because they had always been more Anita's friends than his and because he felt

ashamed, as if his wife's departure revealed his inability to love her. At one

point, around Christmas, he went to a dinner party, but he did not enjoy it. He

found that he was not curious about other people's lives and did not want to

talk about his own.<p>



A month after Anita's departure a letter from her arrived -- a blue aerogram,

telling of the ashram, and of sweeping the courtyard, and of the daily prayers.

Gopal responded immediately, but she never wrote again. His pride prevented him

from trying to continue the correspondence, though he read her one letter so

many times that he inadvertently memorized the Pune address. His brothers sent

a flurry of long missives from India, on paper so thin that it was almost

translucent, but his contact with them over the decades had been minimal, and

the tragedy pushed them apart instead of pulling them closer.<p>



Gitu sent a picture of herself wearing a yellow-and-blue ski jacket in the

Swiss Alps. Gopal wrote her back in a stiff, formal way, and she responded with

a breezy postcard to which he replied only after a long wait.<p>



Other than this, Gopal had had little personal contact with the world. He was

accustomed to getting up early and going to bed late, but now, since he had no

work and no friends, after he spent the morning reading <i>The New York Times

</i>and <i>The Home News &amp; Tribune</i> front to back, Gopal felt adrift

through the afternoon and evening. For a few weeks he tried to fill his days by

showering and shaving twice daily, brushing his teeth after every snack and

meal. But the purposelessness of this made him despair, and he stopped bathing

altogether and instead began sleeping more and more, sometimes sixteen hours a

day. He slept in the living room, long and narrow with high rectangular windows

blocked by trees. At some point, in a burst of self-hate, Gopal moved his

clothes from the bedroom closet to a corner of the living room, wanting to

avoid comforting himself with any illusions that his life was normal.<p>



But he yearned for his old life, the life of a clean kitchen, of a bedroom, of

going out into the sun, and on a half-conscious level that morning Gopal

decided to use the excitement of clasping Mrs. Shaw to change himself back to

the man he had been. She might be spending time at his house, he thought, so he

mopped the kitchen floor, moved back into his bedroom, vacuumed and dusted all

the rooms. He spent most of the afternoon doing this, aware always of his

humming lawn mower in the background. He had only to focus on it to make his

heart race. Every now and then he would stop working and go to his bedroom

window, where, from behind the curtains, he would stare at Mrs. Shaw. She had a

red bandanna tied around her forehead, and he somehow found this appealing.

That night he made himself an elaborate dinner with three dishes and a mango

shake. For the first time in months Gopal watched the eleven o'clock news. He

had the lights off and his feet up on a low table. Lebanon was being bombed

again, and Gopal kept bursting into giggles for no reason. He tried to think of

what he would do tomorrow. Gopal knew that he was happy and that to avoid

depression he must keep himself busy until Mrs. Shaw called. He suddenly

realized that he did not know Mrs. Shaw's first name. He padded into the

darkened kitchen and looked at the phone diary. "Helen Shaw" was written in the

big, loopy handwriting of his wife. Having his wife help him in this way did

not bother him at all, and then he felt ashamed that it didn't.<p>

align=left height=44 alt="T"></font>

	HE next day was Sunday, and Gopal anticipated it cheerfully, for the

Sunday<i> Times</i> was frequently so thick that he could spend the whole day

reading it. But this time he did not read it all the way through. He left the

book review and the other features sections to fill time over the next few

days. After eating a large breakfast -- the idea of preparing elaborate meals had

begun to appeal to him -- he went for a haircut. Gopal had not left his house in

several days. He rolled down the window of his blue Honda Civic and took the

long way, past the lake, to the mall. Instead of going to his usual barber, he

went to a hair stylist, where a woman with long nails and large, contented

breasts shampooed his hair before cutting it. Then Gopal wandered around the

mall, savoring its buttered-popcorn smell and enjoying the sight of the girls

with their sometimes odd-colored hair. He went into some of the small shops and

looked at clothes, and considered buying a half pound of cocoa amaretto coffee

beans, although he had never cared much for coffee. After walking for nearly

two hours, Gopal sat on a bench and ate an ice cream cone while reading an

article in <i>Cosmopolitan</i> about what makes a good lover. He had seen the

magazine in CVS and, noting the article mentioned on the cover, had been

reminded how easily one can learn anything in America. Because Mrs. Shaw was an

American, Gopal thought, he needed to do research into what might be expected

of him. Although the article was about what makes a woman a good lover, it

offered clues for men as well. Gopal felt confident that given time, Mrs. Shaw

would love him. The article made attachment appear effortless. All you had to

do was listen closely and speak honestly.<p>



He returned home around five, and Mrs. Shaw called soon after. "If you want,

you can come over now."<p>



"All right," Gopal answered. He was calm. He showered and put on a blue cotton

shirt and khaki slacks. When he stepped outside, the sky was turning pink and

the air smelled of wet earth. He felt young, as if he had just arrived in

America and the huge scale of things had made him a giant as well.<p>



But when he rang Mrs. Shaw's doorbell, Gopal became nervous. He turned around

and looked at the white clouds against the enormous sky. He heard footsteps and

then the door swishing open and Mrs. Shaw's voice. "You look handsome," she

said. Gopal faced her, smiling and uncomfortable. She wore a different

sweatshirt, but still had on yesterday's jogging pants. She was barefoot. A

yellow light shone behind her.<p>



"Thank you," Gopal said, and then nervously added "Helen," to confirm their new

relationship. "You look nice too." She did look pretty to him. Mrs. Shaw

stepped aside to let him in. They were in a large room. In the center were two

pale couches forming an L, with a television in front of them. Off to the side

was a kitchenette -- a stove, a refrigerator, and some cabinets over a sink and

counter.<p>



Seeing Gopal looking around, Mrs. Shaw said, "There are two bedrooms in the

back, and a bathroom. Would you like anything to drink? I have juice, if you

want." She walked to the kitchen.<p>



"What are you going to have?" Gopal asked, following her. "If you have

something, I'll have something." Then he felt embarrassed. Mrs. Shaw had not

dressed up; obviously, "Not now" had been a polite rebuff.<p>



"I was going to have a gin and tonic," she said, opening the refrigerator and

standing before it with one hand on her hip.<p>



"I would like that too." Gopal came close to her and with a dart kissed her on

the lips. She did not resist, but neither did she respond. Her lips were

chapped. Gopal pulled away and let her make the drinks. He had hoped the kiss

would tell him something of what to expect.<p>



They sat side by side on a couch and sipped their drinks. A table lamp cast a

diffused light over them.<p>



"Thank you for letting me borrow the lawn mower."<p>



"It's nothing." There was a long pause. Gopal could not think of anything to

say. <i>Cosmopolitan</i> had suggested trying to learn as much as possible

about your lover, so he asked, "What's your favorite color?"<p>



"Why?"<p>



"I want to know everything about you." <p>



"That's sweet," Mrs. Shaw said, and patted his hand. Gopal felt embarrassed and

looked down. He did not know whether he should have spoken so frankly, but part

of his intention had been to flatter her with his interest. "I don't have one,"

she said. She kept her hand on his.<p>



Gopal suddenly thought that they might make love tonight, and he felt his heart

kick. "Tell me all about yourself," he said with a voice full of feeling.

"Where were you born?" <p>



"I was born in Jersey City on May fifth, but I won't tell you the year." Gopal

tried to grin gamely and memorize the date. A part of him was disturbed that

she did not feel comfortable enough with him to reveal her age.<p>



"Did you grow up there?" he asked, taking a sip of the gin and tonic. Gopal

drank slowly, because he knew that he could not hold his alcohol. He saw that

Mrs. Shaw's toes were painted bright red. Anita had never used nail polish, and

Gopal wondered what a woman who would paint her toenails might do.<p>



"I moved to Newark when I was three. My parents ran a newspaper-and-candy shop.

We sold greeting cards, stamps." Mrs. Shaw had nearly finished her drink. "They

opened at eight in the morning and closed at seven-thirty at night. Six days a

week." When she paused between swallows, she rested the glass on her knee.<p>



Gopal had never known anyone who worked in such a shop, and he became genuinely

interested in what she was saying. He remembered his lack of interest at the

Christmas party and wondered whether it was the possibility of sex that made

him fascinated with Mrs. Shaw's story. "Were you a happy child?" he asked,

grinning broadly and then bringing the grin to a quick end, because he did not

want to appear ironic. The half glass that Gopal had drunk had already begun to

make him feel light-headed and gay.<p>



"Oh, pretty happy," she said, "although I liked to think of myself as serious.

I would look at the evening sky and think that no one else had felt what I was

feeling." Mrs. Shaw's understanding of her own feelings disconcerted Gopal and

made him momentarily think that he wasn't learning anything important, or that

she was in some way independent of her past and thus incapable of the

sentimental attachments through which he expected her love for him to grow.<p>



<i>Cosmopolitan</i> had recommended that both partners reveal themselves, so

Gopal decided to tell a story about himself. He did not believe that being

honest about himself would actually change him. Rather, he thought the

deliberateness of telling the story would rob it of the power to make him

vulnerable. He started to say something, but the words twisted in his mouth,

and he said, "You know, I don't really drink much." Gopal felt embarrassed by

the non sequitur. He thought he sounded foolish, though he had hoped that the

story he would tell would make him appear sensitive.<p>



"I kind of guessed that from the juices," she said, smiling. Gopal laughed.<p>



He tried to say what he had wanted to confess earlier. "I associate drinking

with being American, and I haven't been able to truly Americanize. On my

daughter's nineteenth birthday we took her to dinner and a movie, but we didn't

talk much, and the dinner finished earlier than we had expected it would. The

restaurant was in a mall, and we had nothing to do until the movie started, so

we wandered around Foodtown." Gopal thought he sounded pathetic, so he tried to

shift the story. "After all my years in America, I am still astonished by those

huge grocery stores and enjoy walking in them. But my daughter is an American,

so our wandering around in Foodtown must have been very strange for her. She

doesn't know Hindi, and her parents must seem very strange." Gopal noticed that

his heart was racing. He wondered if he was sadder than he knew.<p>



"That's sweet," Mrs. Shaw said. The brevity of her response made Gopal nervous.

<p>



Mrs. Shaw kissed his cheek. Her lips were dry, Gopal noticed. He turned

slightly so that their lips could touch. They kissed again. Mrs. Shaw opened

her lips and closed her eyes. They kissed for a long time. When they pulled

apart, they continued their conversation calmly, as if they were accustomed to

each other. "I didn't go into a big grocery store until I was in college," she

said. "We always went to the small shops around us. When I first saw those long

aisles, I wondered what happens to the food if no one buys it. I was living

then with a man who was seven or eight years older than I, and when I told him,

he laughed at me, and I felt so young." She stopped and then added, "I ended up

leaving him because he always made me feel young." Her face was only an inch or

two from Gopal's. "Now I'd marry someone who could make me feel that way."

Gopal felt his romantic feelings drain away at the idea of how many men she had

slept with. But the fact that Mrs. Shaw and he had experienced something

removed some of the loneliness he was feeling, and Mrs. Shaw had large breasts.

They began kissing again. Soon they were tussling and groping on the 

floor.<p>



Her bed was large and low to the ground. Behind it was a window, and

although the shade was drawn, the lights of passing cars cast patterns on the

opposing wall. Gopal lay next to Mrs. Shaw and watched the shadows change. He

felt his head and found that his hair was standing up on either side like

horns. The shock of seeing a new naked body, so different in its amplitude from

his wife's, had been exciting. A part of him was giddy with this, as if he had

checked his bank balance and discovered that he had thousands more than he

expected. "You are very beautiful," he said, for

<i>Cosmopolitan</i> had advised saying this after making love.

Mrs. Shaw rolled over and kissed his shoulder.<p>



"No, I'm not. I'm kind of fat, and my nose is strange. But thank you," she

said. Gopal looked at her and saw that even when her mouth was slack, the lines

around it were deep. "You look like you've been rolled around in a dryer," she

said, and laughed. Her laughter was sudden and confident. He had not noticed it

before, and it made him laugh as well. <p>



They became silent and lay quietly for several minutes, and when Gopal began

feeling self-conscious, he said, "Describe the first house you lived in."<p>



Mrs. Shaw sat up. Her stomach bulged, and her breasts drooped. She saw him

looking and pulled her knees to her chest. "You're very thoughtful," she

said.<p>



Gopal felt flattered. "Oh, it's not thoughtfulness."<p>



"I guess if it weren't for your accent, the questions would sound artificial,"

she said. Gopal felt his stomach clench. "I lived in a block of small houses

that the Army built for returning GIs. They were all drab, and the lawns ran

into each other. They were near Newark airport. I liked to sit at my window and

watch the planes land. That was when Newark was a local airport." <p>



"Your house was two stories?"<p>



"Yes. And my room was on the second floor. Tell me about yourself."<p>



"I am the third of five brothers. We grew up in a small, poor village. I got my

first pair of shoes when I left high school." As Gopal was telling her the

story, he remembered how he used to make Gitu feel lazy with stories of his

childhood, and his voice fell. "Everybody was like us, so I never thought of

myself as poor."<p>



They talked this way for half an hour, with Gopal asking most of the questions

and trying to discover where Mrs. Shaw was vulnerable and how this

vulnerability made him attractive to her. Although she answered his questions

candidly, Gopal could not find the unhappy childhood or the trauma of an

abandoned wife that might explain the urgency of this moment in bed. "I was

planning to leave my husband," she explained casually. "He was crazy. Almost

literally. He thought he was going to be a captain of industry or a senator. He

wasn't registered to vote. He knew nothing about business. Once, he invested

almost everything we had in a hydroponic farm in Southampton. With him I was

always scared of being poor. He used to spend two hundred dollars a week on

lottery tickets, and he would save the old tickets in shoe boxes in the

garage." Gopal did not personally know any Indian who was divorced, and he had

never been intimate enough with an American to learn what a divorce was like,

but he had expected something more painful -- tears and recriminations. The

details she gave made the story sound practiced, and he began to think that he

would never have a hold over Mrs. Shaw.<p>



Around eight Mrs. Shaw said, "I am going to do my bills tonight." Gopal had

been wondering whether she wanted him to have dinner with her and spend the

night. He would have liked to, but he did not protest.<p>



As she closed the door behind him, Mrs. Shaw said, "The lawn mower's in the

back. If you want it." Night had come, and the stars were out. As Gopal pushed

the lawn mower down the road, he wished that he loved Mrs. Shaw and that she

loved him.<p>



He had left the kitchen light on by mistake, and its glow was comforting.

"Come, come, cheer up," he said aloud, pacing in the kitchen. "You have a

lover." He tried to smile and grimaced instead. "You can make love as often as

you want. Be happy." He started preparing dinner. He fried okra and

steam-cooked lentils. He made both rice and bread.<p>



As he ate, Gopal watched a television movie about a woman who had been in a

coma for twenty years and suddenly woke up one day; adding to her confusion,

she was pregnant. After washing the dishes he finished the article in

<i>Cosmopolitan</i> that he had begun reading in the mall. The article was the

second of two parts, and it mentioned that when leaving after making love for

the first time, one should always arrange the next meeting. Gopal had not done

this, and he phoned Mrs. Shaw.<p>



He used the phone in the kitchen, and as he waited for her to pick up, he

wondered whether he should introduce himself or assume that she would recognize

his voice. "Hi, Helen," he blurted out as soon as she said "Hello." "I was just

thinking of you and thought I'd call." He felt more nervous now than he had

while he was with her. <p>



"That's sweet," she said, with what Gopal thought was tenderness. "How are

you?"<p>



"I just had dinner. Did you eat?" He imagined her sitting on the floor between

the couches with a pile of receipts before her. She would have a small pencil

in her hand.<p>



"I'm not hungry. I normally make myself an omelet for dinner, but I didn't want

to tonight. I'm having another drink." Then, self-conscious, she added,

"Otherwise I grind my teeth. I started after my divorce and I didn't have health

insurance or enough money to go to a dentist." Gopal wanted to ask if she still

ground her teeth, but he did not want to imply anything. <p>



"Would you like to have dinner tomorrow? I'll cook." They agreed to meet at

six. The conversation continued for a few minutes longer, and when Gopal hung

up, he was pleased at how well he had handled things.<p>



While lying in bed, waiting for sleep, Gopal read another article in

<i>Cosmopolitan</i>, about job pressure's effects on one's sex life. He had

enjoyed both articles and was happy with himself for his efforts at

understanding Mrs. Shaw. He fell asleep smiling.<p>



<br>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif"

align=left height=44 alt="T"></font>

	HE next day, after reading the papers, Gopal went to the library to read

the first part of the <i>Cosmopolitan </i>article. He ended up reading articles

from <i>Elle</i>, <i>Redbook</i>, <i>Glamour</i>, <i>Mademoiselle</i>, and

<i>Family Circle</i>, and one from <i>Reader's Digest</i> -- "How to Tell If Your

Marriage Is on the Rocks." He tried to memorize jokes from the "Laughter Is the

Best Medicine" section, so that he would never be at a loss for 

conversation.<p>



Gopal arrived at home by four and began cooking. Dinner was pleasant, though

they ate in the kitchen, which was lit with buzzing fluorescent tubes. Gopal

worried that yesterday's lovemaking might have been a fluke. Soon after they

finished the meal, however, they were on the couch, struggling with each

other's clothing.<p>



Gopal wanted Mrs. Shaw to spend the night, but she refused, saying that she had

not slept a full night with anyone since her divorce. At first Gopal was

touched by this. They lay on his bed in the dark. The alarm clock on the

lampstand said 9:12 in big red figures. "Why?" Gopal asked, rolling over and

resting his cheek on her cool shoulder. He wanted to reassure her that he was

eager to listen.<p>



"I think I'm a serial monogamist and I don't want to make things too

complicated." She twisted a lock of his hair around her middle finger. "It

isn't because of you, sweetie. It's with every man."<p>



"Oh," Gopal said, hurt by the idea of other men and disillusioned about her

motives. He continued believing, however, that now that they were lovers, the

power of his concern would make her love him back. One of the articles he had

read that day had suggested that people become dependent in spite of themselves

when they are constantly cared for. So he made himself relax and act

understanding.<p>



Gopal went to bed an hour after Mrs. Shaw left. Before going to sleep he called

her and wished her good night. He began calling her frequently after that, two

or three times a day. Over the next few weeks Gopal found himself becoming coy

and playful with her. When Mrs. Shaw picked up the phone, he made panting

noises, and she laughed at him. She liked his being childlike with her.

Sometimes she would point to a spot on his chest, and he would look down, even

though he knew nothing was there, so that she could tap his nose. When they

made love, she was thoughtful about asking what pleased him, and Gopal learned

from this and began asking her the same. They saw each other nearly every day,

though sometimes only briefly, for a few minutes in the evening or at night.

But Gopal continued to feel nervous around her, as if he were somehow imposing.

If she phoned him and invited him over, he was always flattered. As Gopal

learned more about Mrs. Shaw, he began thinking she was very smart. She read

constantly, primarily history and economics. He was always surprised,

therefore, when she became moody and sentimental and talked about how

loneliness is incurable. Gopal liked Mrs. Shaw in this mood, because it made

him feel needed, but he felt ashamed that he was so insecure. When she did not

laugh at a joke, Gopal doubted that she would ever love him. When they were in

bed together and he thought she might be looking at him, he kept his stomach

sucked in.<p>



<br>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif"

align=left height=44 alt="T"></font>

	HIS sense of precariousness made Gopal try developing other supports for

himself. One morning early in his involvement with Mrs. Shaw he phoned an

Indian engineer with whom he had worked on a project about corrosion of copper

wires and who had also taken early retirement from AT&amp;T. They had met

briefly several times since then and had agreed each time to get together

again, but neither had made the effort. Gopal waited until eleven before

calling, because he felt that any earlier would make him sound needy. A woman

picked up the phone. She told him to wait a minute as she called for Rishi.

Gopal felt vaguely deceitful, as if he were trying to pass himself off as just

like everyone else, although his wife and child had left him.<p>



"I haven't been doing much," he confessed immediately to Rishi. "I read a lot."

When Rishi asked what, Gopal answered "Magazines," with embarrassment. They

were silent then. Gopal did not want to ask Rishi immediately if he would like

to meet for dinner, so he hunted desperately for a conversational opening. He

was sitting in the kitchen. He looked at the sunlight on the newspaper before

him and remembered that he could ask Rishi questions. "How are <i>you

</i>doing?"<p>



"It isn't like India," Rishi responded, complaining. "In India the older you

are, the closer you are to the center of attention. Here you have to keep

going. Your children are away and you have nothing to do. I would go back, but

Ratha doesn't want to. America is much better for women."<p>



Gopal felt a rush of relief that Rishi had spoken so much. "Are you just at

home or are you doing something part time?"<p>



"I am the president of the Indian Cultural Association," Rishi said

boastfully.<p>



"That's wonderful," Gopal said, and with a leap added, "I want to get involved

in that more, now that I have time." <p>



"We always need help. We are going to have a fair," Rishi said. "It's on the

twenty-fourth, next month. We need help coordinating things, arranging food,

putting up flyers."<p>



"I can help," Gopal said. They decided that he should come to Rishi's house on

Wednesday, two days later.<p>



Gopal was about to hang up when Rishi added, "I heard about your family." Gopal

felt as if he had been caught in a lie. "I am sorry," Rishi said.<p>



Gopal was quiet for a moment and then said, "Thank you." He did not know

whether he should pretend to be sad. "It takes some getting used to," he said,

"but you can go on from nearly anything."<p>



Gopal went to see Rishi that Wednesday, and on Sunday he attended a board

meeting to plan for the fair. He told jokes about a nearsighted snake and a

water hose, and about a golf instructor and God. One of the men he met there

invited him to dinner.<p>



Mrs. Shaw, however, continued to dominate his thoughts. The more they made

love, the more absorbed Gopal became in the texture of her nipples in his mouth

and the heft of her hips in his hands. He thought of this in the shower, while

driving, while stirring his cereal. Two or three times over the next month

Gopal picked her up during her lunch hour and they hurried home to make love.

They would make love and then talk. Mrs. Shaw had once worked at a dry cleaner,

and Gopal found this fascinating. He had met only one person in his life before

Mrs. Shaw who had worked in a dry-cleaning business, and that was different,

because it was in India, where dry cleaning still had the glamour of advancing

technology. Being the lover of someone who had worked in a dry-cleaning

business made Gopal feel strange. It made him think that the world was huge

beyond comprehension, and to spend his time trying to control his own small

world was inefficient. Gopal began thinking that he loved Mrs. Shaw. He started

listening to the golden-oldies station in the car, so that he could hear what

she had heard in her youth.<p>



Mrs. Shaw would ask about his life, and Gopal tried to tell her everything she

wanted to know in as much detail as possible. Once, he told her of how he had

begun worrying when his daughter was finishing high school that she was going

to slip from his life. To show that he loved her, he had arbitrarily forbidden

her to ski, claiming that skiing was dangerous. He had hoped that she would

find this quaintly immigrant, but she was just angry. At first the words

twisted in his mouth, and he spoke to Mrs. Shaw about skiing in general. Only

with an effort could he tell her about his fight with Gitu. Mrs. Shaw did not

say anything at first. Then she said, "It's all right if you were that way

once, as long as you aren't that way now." Listening to her, Gopal suddenly

felt angry.<p>



"Why do you talk like this?" he asked.<p>



"What?"<p>



"When you talk about how your breasts fall or how your behind is too wide, I

always say that's not true. I always see you with eyes that make you

beautiful."<p>



"Because I want the truth," she said, also angry.<p>



Gopal became quiet. Her desire for honesty appeared to refute all his delicate

and constant manipulations. Was he actually in love with her, he wondered, or

was this love just a way to avoid loneliness? And did it matter that so much of

what he did was conscious?<p>



He questioned his love more and more as the day of the Indian festival

approached and Gopal realized that he was delaying asking Mrs. Shaw to come

with him. She knew about the fair but had not mentioned her feelings. Gopal

told himself that she would feel uncomfortable among so many Indians, but he

knew that he hadn't asked her because bringing her would make him feel awkward.

For some reason he was nervous that word of Mrs. Shaw might get to his wife and

daughter. He was also anxious about what the Indians with whom he had recently

become friendly would think. He had met mixed couples at Indian parties before,

and they were always treated with the deference usually reserved for cripples.

If Mrs. Shaw had been of any sort of marginalized ethnic group -- a

first-generation immigrant, for instance -- then things might have been easier.<p>



The festival was held in the Edison First Aid Squad's square blue-and-white

building. A children's dance troupe performed in red dresses so stiff with gold

thread that the girls appeared to hobble as they moved about the center of the

concrete floor. A balding comedian in oxblood shoes and a white suit performed.

Light folding tables along one wall were precariously laden with large pots,

pans, and trays of food. Gopal stood in a corner with several men who had

retired from AT&amp;T and, slightly drunk, improvised on jokes he had read in

<i>1,001 Polish Jokes</i>. The Poles became Sikhs, but he kept most of the

rest. He was laughing and feeling proud that he could so easily become the

center of attention, but he felt lonely at the thought that when the food was

served, the men at his side would drift away to join their families and he

would stand alone in line. After listening to talk of someone's marriage, he

began thinking about Mrs. Shaw. The men were clustered together, and the women

conversed separately. They will go home and make love and not talk, Gopal

thought. Then he felt sad and frightened. To make amends for his guilt at not

bringing Mrs. Shaw along, he told a bearded man with yellow teeth, "These Sikhs

aren't so bad. They are the smartest ones in India, and no one can match a Sikh

for courage." Then Gopal felt dazed and ready to leave.<p>



<br>

<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/W-small.gif"

align=left height=44 alt="W"></font>

	HEN Gopal pulled into his driveway, it was late afternoon. His head felt

oddly still, as it always did when alcohol started wearing off, but Gopal knew

that he was drunk enough to do something foolish. He parked and walked down the

road to Mrs. Shaw's. He wondered if she would be in. Pale tulips bloomed in a

thin, uneven row in front of her house. The sight of them made him 

hopeful.<p>



Mrs. Shaw opened the door before he could knock. For a moment Gopal did not say

anything. She was wearing a denim skirt and a sleeveless white shirt. She

smiled at him. Gopal spoke solemnly and from far off. "I love you," he said to

her for the first time. "I am sorry I didn't invite you to the fair." He waited

a moment for his statement to sink in and for her to respond with a similar

endearment. When she did not, he repeated, "I love you."<p>



Then she said, "Thank you," and told him not to worry about the fair. She

invited him in. Gopal was confused and flustered by her reticence. He began

feeling awkward about his confession. They kissed briefly, and then Gopal went

home.<p>



The next night, as they sat together watching TV in his living room, Mrs. Shaw

suddenly turned to Gopal and said, "You really do love me, don't you?" Although

Gopal had expected the question, he was momentarily disconcerted by it, because

it made him wonder what love was and whether he was capable of it. But he did

not think that this was the time to quibble over semantics. After being silent

long enough to suggest that he was struggling with his vulnerability, Gopal

said yes and waited for Mrs. Shaw's response. Again she did not confess her

love. She kissed his forehead tenderly. This show of sentiment made Gopal

angry, but he said nothing. He was glad, though, when Mrs. Shaw left that

night.<p>



The next day Gopal waited for Mrs. Shaw to return home from work. He had

decided that the time had come for the next step in their relationship. As soon

as he saw her struggle through her doorway, hugging sacks of groceries, Gopal

phoned. He stood on the steps to his house, with the extension cord trailing

over one shoulder, and looked at her house and at her rusted and

exhausted-looking station wagon, which he had begun to associate strongly and

warmly with the broad sweep of Mrs. Shaw's life. Gopal nearly said, "I missed

you" when she picked up the phone, but he became embarrassed and asked, "How

was your day?"<p>



"Fine," she said, and Gopal imagined her moving about the kitchen, putting away

whatever she had bought, placing the tea kettle on the stove, and sorting her

mail on the kitchen table. This image of domesticity and independence moved him

deeply. "There's a guidance counselor who is dying of cancer," she said, "and

his friends are having a party for him, and they put up a sign saying 'RSVP

with your money now! Henry can't wait for the party!'" Gopal and Mrs. Shaw

laughed.<p>



"Let's do something," he said.<p>



"What?"<p>



Gopal had not thought this part out. He wanted to do something romantic that

would last until bedtime, so that he could pressure her to spend the night.

"Would you like to have dinner?"<p>



"Sure," she said. Gopal was pleased. He had gone to a liquor store a few days

earlier and bought wine, just in case he had an opportunity to get Mrs. Shaw

drunk and get her to fall asleep beside him.<p>



Gopal plied Mrs. Shaw with wine as they ate the linguine he had cooked. They

sat in the kitchen, but he had turned off the fluorescent lights and lit a

candle. By the third glass Gopal was feeling very brave; he placed his hand on

her inner thigh.<p>



"My mother and father," Mrs. Shaw said halfway through the meal, pointing at

him with her fork and speaking with the deliberateness of the drunk, "convinced

me that people are not meant to live together for long periods of time." She

was speaking in response to Gopal's hint earlier that only over time and

through living together could people get to know each other properly. "If you

know someone that well, you are bound to be disappointed."<p>



"Maybe that's because you haven't met the right person," Gopal answered,

feeling awkward for saying something that could be considered arrogant when he

was trying to appear vulnerable.<p>



"I don't think there is a right person. Not for me. To fall in love I think you

need a certain suspension of disbelief, which I don't think I am capable of."<p>



Gopal wondered whether Mrs. Shaw believed what she was saying or was trying not

to hurt his feelings by revealing that she couldn't love him. He stopped

eating.<p>



Mrs. Shaw stared at him. She put her fork down and said, "I love you. I love

how you care for me and how gentle you are."<p>



Gopal smiled. Perhaps, he thought, the first part of her statement had been a

preface to a confession that he mattered so much that she was willing to make

an exception for him. "I love you too," Gopal said. "I love how funny and smart

and honest you are. You are very beautiful." He leaned over slightly to suggest

that he wanted to kiss her, but Mrs. Shaw did not respond.<p>



Her face was stiff. "I love you," she said again, and Gopal became nervous.

"But I am not <i>in</i> love with you." She stopped and stared at Gopal.<p>



Gopal felt confused. "What's the difference?"<p>



"When you are <i>in</i> love, you never think about yourself, because you love

the other person so completely. I've lived too long to think anyone is that

perfect." Gopal still didn't understand the distinction, but he was too

embarrassed to ask more. It was only fair, a part of him thought, that God

would punish him this way for driving away his wife and child. How could anyone

love him? <p>



Mrs. Shaw took his hands in hers. "I think we should take a little break from

each other, so we don't get confused. Being with you, I'm getting confused too.

We should see other people."<p>



"Oh." Gopal's chest hurt despite his understanding of the justice of what was

happening.<p>



"I don't want to hide anything. I love you. I truly love you. You are the

kindest lover I've ever had."<p>



"Oh."<p>



For a week after this Gopal observed that Mrs. Shaw did not bring another man

to her house. He went to the Sunday board meeting of the cultural association,

where he regaled the members with jokes from <i>Reader's Digest</i>. He taught

his first Hindi class to children at the temple. He took his car to be

serviced. Gopal did all these things. He ate. He slept. He even made love to

Mrs. Shaw once, and until she asked him to leave, he thought everything was all

right again.<p>



Then, one night, Gopal was awakened at a little after three by a car pulling

out of Mrs. Shaw's driveway. It is just a friend, he thought, standing by his

bedroom window and watching the Toyota move down the road. Gopal tried falling

asleep again, but he could not, though he was not thinking of anything in

particular. His mind was blank, but sleep did not come.<p>



I will not call her, Gopal thought in the morning. And as he was dialing her,

he thought he would hang up before all the numbers had been pressed. He heard

the receiver being lifted on the other side and Mrs. Shaw saying "Hello." He

did not say anything. "Don't do this, Gopal," she said softly. "Don't hurt

me."<p>



"Hi," Gopal whispered, wanting very much to hurt her. He leaned his head

against the kitchen wall. His face twitched as he whispered, "I'm sorry."<p>



"Don't be that way. I love you. I didn't want to hurt you. That's why I told

you."<p>



"I know."<p>



"All right?"<p>



"Yes." They were silent for a long time. Then Gopal hung up. He wondered if she

would call back. He waited, and when she didn't, he began jumping up and down

in place.<p>

<br>



<font size=+2><img src="../../../dropcaps/F-small.gif"

align=left height=44 alt="F"></font> OR the next few weeks Gopal tried to spend as little 	time as possible in his

house. He read the morning papers in the library, and then had lunch at a

diner, and then went back to the library. On Sundays he spent all day at the

mall. His anger at Mrs. Shaw soon disappeared, because he thought that the

blame for her leaving lay with him. Gopal continued, however, to avoid home,

because he did not want to experience the jealousy that would keep him awake

all night. Only if he arrived late enough and tired enough could he fall

asleep. In the evening Gopal either went to the temple and helped at the seven

o'clock service or visited one of his new acquaintances. But over the weeks he

exhausted the kindheartedness of his acquaintances and had a disagreement with

one man's wife, and he was forced to return home.<p>



The first few evenings he spent at home Gopal thought he would have to flee his

house in despair. He slept awkwardly, waking at the barest rustle outside his

window, thinking that a car was pulling out of Mrs. Shaw's driveway. The days

were easier than the nights, especially when Mrs. Shaw was away at work. Gopal

would sleep a few hours at night and then nap during the day, but this left him

exhausted and dizzy. In the afternoon he liked to sit on the steps and read the

paper, pausing occasionally to look at her house. He liked the sun sliding up

its walls. Sometimes he was sitting outside when she drove home from work. Mrs.

Shaw waved to him once or twice, but he did not respond, not because he was

angry but because he felt himself become so still at the sight of her that he

could neither wave nor smile.<p>



A month and a half after they separated, Gopal still could not sleep at night

if he thought there were two cars in Mrs. Shaw's driveway. Once, after a series

of sleepless nights, he was up until three watching a dark shape behind Mrs.

Shaw's station wagon. He waited by his bedroom window, paralyzed with fear and

hope, for a car to pass in front of her house and strike the shape with its

headlights. After a long time in which no car went by, Gopal decided to check

for himself.<p>



He started across his lawn crouched over and running. The air was warm and

smelled of jasmine, and Gopal was so tired that he thought he might spill to

the ground. After a few steps he stopped and straightened up. The sky was

clear, and there were so many stars that Gopal felt as if he were in his

village in India. The houses along the street were dark and drawn in on

themselves. Even in India, he thought, late at night the houses look like

sleeping faces. He remembered how surprised he had been by the pitched roofs of

American houses when he had first come here, and how this had made him yearn to

return to India, where he could sleep on the roof. He started across the lawn

again. Gopal walked slowly, and he felt as if he were crossing a great

distance.<p>



The station wagon stood battered and alone, smelling faintly of gasoline and

the day's heat. Gopal leaned against its hood. The station wagon was so old

that the odometer had gone all the way around. Like me, he thought, and like

Helen, too. This is who we are, he thought -- dusty, corroded, and dented from

our voyages, with our unflagging hearts rattling on inside. We are made who we

are by the dust and corrosion and dents and unflagging hearts. Why should we

need anything else to fall in love? he wondered. We learn and change and get

better. He leaned against the car for a minute or two. Fireflies swung

flickering in the breeze. Then he walked home.<p>



Gopal woke early and showered and shaved and made breakfast. He brushed his

teeth after eating and felt his cheeks to see whether he should shave again,

this time against the grain. At nine he crossed his lawn and rang Mrs. Shaw's

doorbell. He had to ring it several times before he heard her footsteps. When

she opened the door and saw him, Mrs. Shaw drew back as if she were afraid.

Gopal felt sad that she could think he might hurt her. "May I come in?" he

asked. She stared at him. He saw mascara stains beneath her eyes and silver

strands mingled with her red hair. He thought he had never seen a woman as

beautiful or as gallant.<p>

alt="William Ewart Gladstone">

	
<font size=5>O</font>N March 3, 1894, William Ewart Gladstone resigned for the last time as
Prime Minister of England. He was in his eighty-fifth year and had been a
member of Parliament for more than sixty years, since his election, at
twenty-two, to the
first reformed Parliament, after the great Reform Bill of 1832 had adumbrated
the gradual democratization of England. He had first joined the Cabinet at
thirty-three, as the third youngest man ever to do so; he had become Prime
Minister for the first time more than twenty-six years before his final
departure; and he had held the office four times in all, in 1868-1874, in 1880-
1885, for six months in 1886, and in 1892-1894.<p>

The sheer length and scope of his public life make him stand alone in the
history of his or any other country: <a href="http://www.winstonchurchill.org/">
Winston Churchill</a> is the only comparison.
It has been said that all political careers end in failure, and Gladstone might
seem to illustrate the saying. When he finally left Downing Street, it was to
the relief of most of his colleagues, with almost no thanks from Queen
Victoria, who had come to detest him, and without accomplishing the great task
of his later years -- a just settlement for Ireland. For all that, Gladstone had
done more with his life than another two or three politicians put together, and
his legislative and financial record places him in the very first rank of
English statesmen. <p>

And yet what best defines this extraordinary man is the way in which he spent
his last day as the leader of what was then the greatest power on earth. He
recorded that he had been to church, written half a dozen letters, seen half a
dozen people, "Read I. Hen. VI. And <i>finished</i> my version of the Odes of
Horace." Reading a Shakespeare play might seem unlikely enough in the
circumstances, let alone completing a classical translation. But then, as
Gladstone recorded in the breathtaking human document that is his
<i>Diaries</i>, he read during the course of his life at least 20,000 books in
at least six languages, and he was an indefatigable writer, translator, and
controversialist. <p>

He had a wondrous ability to switch off from politics and write an enormously
long article on church music, say, or a 15,000-word critical essay on Tennyson.
Earlier in his career, when out of office for the moment, he had thought
nothing of producing a four-volume translation of Farini's <i>Lo stato
romano</i>. On one occasion when he had recently ceased to be Chancellor of the
Exchequer, and on another when he had ceased to be Prime Minister, he published
vast if idiosyncratic studies of Homer. <p>

Some of what he wrote -- an essay on Giacomo Leopardi, for example -- is still
worth reading, though his writing was uneven, partly because of his
inexhaustible prolificity. This was itself an expression of the demonic energy
that otherwise manifested itself in enormously long walks, in hill-climbing
into old age, and in his most famous physical pastime of tree-felling (in the
mordant phrase of Lord Randolph Churchill, father of Winston, "The forest
laments, in order that Mr. Gladstone may perspire").<p>

<br>

<font size=5>G</font>LADSTONE'S latest biographer hesitates to claim that
he was the greatest of
all premiers; for one thing, unlike the two William Pitts, Lloyd George, and
Churchill, he never led his country in the supreme test of war. But Roy Jenkins
has "no doubt that he was the most remarkable specimen of humanity of all the
fifty who, from [Robert] Walpole to [John] Major, have so far held the office
of British Prime Minister." Few who read this utterly absorbing life will
disagree with him.<p>

Prime Minister of England, I have called him, and he would have called himself,
but by descent he was pure Scotch, as he would also have said. Although it is
sometimes observed that our damp little island has a class system (as if other
countries were innocent of class), the system has always been permeable by
money. John Gladstone was not a gentleman but a corn merchant from Leith, near
Edinburgh. He moved to Liverpool and made a larger fortune, partly from West
Indian sugar, which is to say from slavery. His son William was born in 1809,
and those unlovely profits were used to give him a traditional upper-class
education at Eton and Christ Church. Despite that, and despite marrying into a
landed family, the Glynnes, whose estate at Hawarden, in northeast Wales,
eventually passed to his descendants, Gladstone was all his life conscious of
not belonging to the aristocracy.<p>

Before the end of his days he was to become a byword for liberalism. Literally
so: almost a hundred years after his death "Gladstonian Liberal" is still a
phrase by which some of us are happy to describe ourselves. But this was after
he had made the lengthiest possible political pilgrimage, having begun life as
far on the other side as could be. His first Commons speech was in dutifully
filial opposition to a slavery-abolition bill, and a few years later he was
described by the essayist Thomas Babington Macaulay as "the rising hope of
those stern and unbending Tories." The phrase, which haunted Gladstone for
years, was inspired by his first, truly bizarre book, <i>The State in its
Relations With the Church</i>. It was a work of intellectual fanaticism, a
last-ditch defense of the confessional state that Tory England had tried to
construct and maintain since the Restoration, in 1660, with all office and
power reserved to communicant members of the Established Church of England. At
a time when Catholic emancipation had just been passed, and full Jewish
emancipation was within sight, Gladstone proposed a Protestant Episcopalian
theocracy not only in England (which could at least claim to be a Protestant
country) but in Ireland also. <p>

His slow political evolution was bound up with the turmoil of the middle
decades of the century and the crisis over the repeal of the protectionist Corn
Laws, a cause to which the brave and principled Sir Robert Peel was converted
as a moral necessity. Gladstone served in Peel's Cabinet, and for years after
Peel's death, in 1850, called himself a Peelite -- a first stage in his escape
from high Toryism. Peel had been harried to destruction by the brilliant and
insolent young adventurer Benjamin Disraeli, who now became Gladstone's great
rival in a contest that lasted three decades. From 1858 to 1868 one or the
other was Chancellor of the Exchequer (which personal factor incidentally much
increased the status of what had until then been a rather unimportant office),
and from 1868 to 1885 one or the other was Prime Minister. The duel between
them made a fascinating human and political contrast.<p>

Given his background, and given England, Disraeli's career was heroic in its
own way. Flippant, cynical, realistic or opportunistic according to taste,
Disraeli was contemptuous of the intensely devout and earnest Gladstone,
high-minded or self-righteous according to taste. The scorn was repaid in kind.
In 1852 Disraeli's first, brief spell as Chancellor came to an abrupt end
when -- in that golden age of parliamentary government when party allegiances
were fluid and votes could be swayed by argument -- Gladstone rose in the
Commons
at 1:00 A.M. and demolished Disraeli's budget in a lethal speech. Without
question Gladstone proved himself the better Chancellor when he held the post
under Lord Aberdeen, Lord Palmerston, and Lord Russell -- in fact, one of the
greatest of all custodians of the public purse, as the sonorous phrase used to
go. <p>

By the time Gladstone became Prime Minister, in 1868, the Liberal Party had
been born out of a coalition of Whigs, Peelites, and radicals, and Gladstone
was by then indeed a Liberal, a believer in "peace, economy and reform." He was
never a Whig, being temperamentally averse to that patrician cousinage, who
were as easygoing in their public finances as in their private lives. His
colleague Sir Charles Dilke spoke sourly of his "Scotch toadyism to the
aristocracy," and he certainly spent much time touring ducal country houses.
But those tours ended in the last years of his life, by which time he had
become "the People's William," venerated by humble cottagers and laborers and
execrated by the "upper ten thousand." <p>

There are parallels here with Franklin D. Roosevelt, a later "class traitor"
who inspired loathing among the rich. In 1882 Gladstone's private secretary,
Edward Hamilton, described dinner with the Cavendish Bentincks:
<blockquote>
I was the solitary Liberal. I am sure that if I had been a Tory all my life the
bitterness and narrow-mindedness of my friends would have converted me to
Radicalism. It is all indiscriminate abuse. Everything that Mr. G. does must be
wrong and wicked, and everything wrong and wicked that happens must be
attributable to Mr. G.
</blockquote>
<p>

The hatred may have been a little misplaced, since Gladstone was no radical
either. Although he had become a great popular orator, addressing vast
audiences on the stump, he was ill at ease in the new industrial cities, and
once insisted, "I am an out-and-out <i>inequalitarian</i>." Toward the end of
his life he wrote to the Queen (in one of the numerous didactic letters that so
got on her nerves) deploring the political class divisions that for the first
time had driven almost all people of property into the ranks of the Tories and
that, along with Ireland, so envenomed the atmosphere in the decades flanking
the turn of the century. <p>

<br>

<font size=5>I</font>N his thirties Gladstone had presciently written to
his wife, "Ireland,
Ireland! That cloud in the west, that coming storm, the vehicle of God's
retribution. . . ." But in practice he had ignored the coming storm until the
1860s. If Ireland had impinged upon him, it was as a reproach to England's
reputation abroad. For a man with such a keen sense of righteousness, who
lectured reactionary foreign statesmen like Felix Schwarzenberg, of Austria,
about the misrule of subject peoples, it was galling to have Ireland thrown
back as a <i>tu quoque</i>, rather as moralizing Americans who wanted to
denounce European colonialism or communist dictatorship used to be reminded of
Jim Crow and the lynch mob. It was not Gladstone but Disraeli who had
sardonically but succinctly summed up the Irish question in a Commons speech of
1844. <p>
<blockquote>
"A dense population inhabit an island where there is an established church
which is not their church, and a territorial aristocracy, the richest of whom
live in a distant capital. Thus they have a starving population, an alien
church, and in addition the weakest executive in the world. . . . the Irish
could not have a revolution and why? Because Ireland is connected with another
and more powerful country. Then what is the consequence? . . . If the
connection with England prevented a revolution and a revolution was the only
remedy, England logically is in the odious position of being the cause of all
the misery of Ireland. What then is the duty of an English minister? To effect
by his policy all those changes which a revolution would effect by force."
</blockquote>

If he didn't acknowledge their inspiration, Gladstone belatedly took those
words to heart and tried to act on them when he became Prime Minister. In 1869
he disestablished the Protestant Church of Ireland, and the following year he
began to deal with the wretched system of land tenure that lay beneath so much
Irish misery. Tentative and not very successful at first, his legislation
commenced the slow process by which the old landlord class was eased out of
Ireland.<p>

After electoral defeat in 1874 Gladstone wanted to withdraw from politics, or
claimed that he did. As always, he was inscrutable and unfathomable in his
motives. Despite his keen intelligence, his self-knowledge was clouded by the
belief that he was guided by a higher power. His religious conviction was
total, not to say suffocating -- on losing an election he sententiously consoled
himself, "But One ever sitteth above" -- and, as is often the case with men who
think themselves so guided, he could give to others the impression of
deviousness or even unscrupulousness. <p>

Whatever he had really intended, he sprang back into political life in 1876
over the "Bulgarian Horrors." Liberal opinion was convulsed by atrocities in
the Balkans (<i>plus &ccedil;a change</i> . . .), in particular the massacre of
more than 10,000 Bulgars by Turkish irregulars. Gladstone dashed off a
ferociously eloquent pamphlet: "Let the Turks now carry away their abuses in
the only possible manner, namely by carrying off themselves . . . one and all,
bag and baggage, shall I hope clear out from the province they have desolated
and profaned." The pamphlet sold an astonishing 200,000 copies (another
pamphlet he had written a couple of years earlier, attacking the "Vatican
decrees," the newly proclaimed doctrine of papal infallibility, had sold a
scarcely less astonishing 150,000). Not everyone was enraptured. Gladstone sent
a complimentary copy to the Prime Minister, which provoked from Lord
Beaconsfield, as Disraeli had just become, one of his cruelest wisecracks:
Gladstone's pamphlet was "of all the Bulgarian horrors perhaps the greatest."<p>

By 1880 Gladstone had once more swept to electoral victory, to the rage of the
Queen. Her mind had by now been disgracefully poisoned against him by Disraeli,
and she wrote to her private secretary in her inimitable epistolary style, "She
will sooner <i>abdicate </i>than send for or have any <i>communication </i>with
<i>that</i> <i>half mad firebrand </i>who wd soon ruin everything &amp; be a
<i>Dictator</i>. Others but herself <i>may submit to </i>his democratic rule
but <i>not the Queen</i>." As it happened, she didn't abdicate, but she had
revenge of a sort. Gladstone's second government was much less happy than his
first, and began to unravel almost before it began. The artificial coalition of
patrician Whigs and plebeian radicals could in any case not have been held
together forever, but Gladstone's ineptitude in personal relations didn't help.
It was quite a feat, as Jenkins says, to drive the Whig Lord Hartington and the
radical Joseph Chamberlain out of the party and into each other's arms.<p>

<br>

<font size=5>I</font>N contrast to his first, Gladstone's second government
was beset by
difficulties, few of which showed him at his best. Gladstonian Liberalism
was -- or should have been -- inimical to imperialism, but the British Empire was
expanding under its own momentum, and Gladstone was landed with problems from
South Africa to Afghanistan. He gravely damaged his reputation among pacifists
and anti-imperialists by his attack on Egypt in 1882, and was then execrated
from the other side by jingoes (which sense of the word had just been coined)
when the adventurer General Charles George Gordon was sent to the Sudan and was
killed at Khartoum before he could be rescued from a predicament of his own
making. <p>

One startling aspect of that story was Gladstone's heavy personal investment in
Egyptian stock. It looks on the face of it "a clear case of improper financial
interest,"Jenkins writes. By modern standards and with modern press attention,
without even intrusive investigation . . . his position would have been wholly
untenable." But Jenkins goes on to say that he does "not believe for a moment
that his primary or even his significantly supporting motivation sprang from
financial self-interest." This may seem naive; I am sure it is correct, and
that Jenkins is right to say that "Gladstone's blend of innocence and grandeur
transcended the possibility of corruption."<p>

With all those woes it isn't surprising that Gladstone's second government was
so barren of creative achievement -- with all those and with Ireland, the
question that infected politics and then shattered the Liberal Party less than
thirty years after its birth. Into the 1870s Gladstone still suffered from the
prevailing English delusion that Irish grievances could be cured by kindness,
and that there was nothing to them but religious or economic discontent. This
belief was dented by continuing agrarian violence, and by the swelling number
of Irish Home Rulers returned to Parliament, now under the formidable
leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell. <p>

Each central decade of Gladstone's career had a dominating personal
relationship: partnership, rivalry, or something between. It was Peel in the
1840s, Aberdeen in the 1850s, Palmerston in the 1860s, and Disraeli in the
1870s. In the 1880s it was Parnell. He first mastered the arts of filibustering
and parliamentary obstruction and then, with "the eighty-six of
'eighty-six" -- the solid, disciplined phalanx of Irish Nationalist MPs who
entered the Commons that year -- was able to exert real power. They were
returned
to Parliament thanks partly to Gladstone's Third Reform Bill of 1884, which
greatly extended the franchise and for the first time treated Ireland and Great
Britain on equal terms, thus increasing the Irish electorate by 230 percent.
Irish votes brought down Gladstone's second government in June of 1885, to be
replaced by the Conservatives under Lord Salisbury. <p>

By now Gladstone had at last made up his mind that Home Rule was necessary. He
was intellectually and morally convinced, as Peel had been over the Corn Laws.
He saw that Irish resistance and the English reaction to it were "corrupting
the whole polity," in Jenkins's words: "the maintenance of the liberal state
was incompatible with holding within its centralized grip a large disaffected
community of settled mind." (Irish nationalists may note that this would apply
equally to a "united Ireland" that tried to hold a million disaffected Ulster
Protestants within its grip.) He hoped that Home Rule might even be carried by
the Tories, the "wrong" party taking a historically essential step, for which
there had been precedents in England in his lifetime -- Catholic emancipation in
1829, repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. <p>

But once Gladstone's conversion became known, Tory suspicion and hatred of him
only increased, and the Tories settled down for a generation of sterile
opposition to Irish self-rule. The rest is history, and tragedy. Salisbury's
government lasted only a few months. In February of 1886 Gladstone formed a
third government, now with Parnell's support. In March the Home Rule Bill was
presented to the Cabinet, and Joseph Chamberlain resigned. In April, Gladstone
introduced the bill in the Commons with a magnificent three-and-a-half-hour
speech. In June the bill was defeated in the Commons, nearly a hundred Liberals
voting against; they were shortly to defect from the party as "Liberal
Unionists."<p>

Although Gladstone lost the subsequent general election heavily, he returned to
form a last government in 1892. Despite the fall and death of Parnell (that
Greek tragedy all of its own), he introduced the Second Home Rule Bill in 1893.
This time it passed in the Commons but was defeated by the House of Lords,
giving notice that no Irish settlement was possible until the power of the
Lords was curbed -- as it was eventually, in 1911. Six months after the
defeat of
the bill Gladstone resigned forever, having returned to office only with deep
apprehension: "The heaviest weight I can well be called to bear. But all is
with God. His blessed will be done." <p>

For all the ferocity of party strife and for all the personal animosity he
aroused, few could withhold admiration from this heroic octogenarian as he
steered the bill through largely single-handedly, with one grand speech after
another. "In different parts of the House," Jenkins writes, "even among his
bitterest opponents, there was a sense of witnessing a magnificent last
performance by a unique creature, the like of whom would never be seen again."
One evening in the Commons during that magnificent performance a Liberal
Unionist was stopped by one of the most bitter opponents, the choleric Lord
Randolph Churchill. "And that is the man you deserted," Lord Randolph said.
"How could you do it?"<p>

<br>


<font size=5>T</font>HE many biographies of this great man began with the
official life, one of the
very best of its kind, published soon after Gladstone's death by John Morley,
the younger colleague to whom he was closest. The best scholarly treatment of
Gladstone's life is the series of introductions by H.C.G. Matthew to the superb
fourteen-volume Oxford University Press edition of <i>The Gladstone</i>
<i>Diaries</i> (the introductions can be bought separately in two volumes). The
<i>Diaries </i>make endlessly fascinating reading, not for literary quality but
for the portrait of the man who kept them. They are his life's justification,
kept for the final judgment in which he so passionately believed, an account
book of how he had used the days granted him on earth.<p>

This latest biography of Gladstone is very readable and well judged. Roy
Jenkins's advantages as a biographer are less scholarly or stylistic than
personal. If his career hasn't been quite as extraordinary as Gladstone's
(whose has?), it has been remarkable enough. Now seventy-six, he was at Oxford
at the end of the 1930s in a generation that produced two Prime Ministers,
Harold Wilson and Edward Heath. After wartime army service he entered the House
of Commons as a Labour MP in 1948 and stayed there through 1976. In the
1964-1970 Wilson government he became Home Secretary and then Chancellor of the
Exchequer. In the former post he helped to liberalize the laws on
homosexuality, abortion, and divorce, for which he is still praised or blamed;
in the latter he had a record of truly Gladstonian financial rectitude and is
still blamed or praised for losing the 1970 election by refusing to buy votes
with tax cuts or inflationary spending.<p>

Many people (including, no doubt, Jenkins himself) saw him following further in
Gladstone's footsteps to 10 Downing Street. But in the 1970s, a period in
British politics as turbulent as the 1840s or the 1880s, he was a victim of the
bitter dissension over membership in the European Community and of Labour's
self-destructive faction fighting. After another two years as Home Secretary,
the strongly pro-European Jenkins departed Westminster for Brussels and served
as president of the European Commission from 1977 to 1981. He then returned
home to British politics and helped to found the Social Democratic Party, which
in the early 1980s gave the illusory impression that it might replace Labour as
the main party opposed to the Tories. <p>

Lord Jenkins of Hillhead (as he has been since 1987, the year he also became
chancellor of Oxford, elected by the alumni) thus has that knowledge of real
life and the great world that book-learned academic historians so often lack.
In a parallel literary career he has written a number of books, among them
biographies of Sir Charles Dilke and H. H. Asquith. He is naturally good on the
texture of political life: the fact that Parliament used to meet for less of
the year, from February to August, though when it did meet, it sat strenuously,
from the afternoon into the small hours; or the mid-Victorian practice, which
seems surprising since the arrival of "the weekend," of holding Cabinet
meetings on Saturday.<p>

Queen Victoria once regretted that Gladstone was "not a man of the world."
In Roy
Jenkins's view, this was "an unattractive catchphrase which she had picked up
from Disraeli"; it is not one that will ever be applied to Jenkins. He is a man
of the world to a degree that has attracted not always good-natured mockery,
the son of a Welsh miner who has fashioned himself into the Last Whig,
sophisticated and sybaritic. <p>

<br>


<font size=5>I</font>F a recent BBC television documentary is to be
believed, Jenkins is no
stranger, either, to the pleasures of female companionship. Perhaps for this
reason he is better than any previous biographer on Gladstone's sexual
personality and the most notorious aspect of his life -- his "rescue work" among
London prostitutes. Even now it almost beggars belief that, before and while he
was Prime Minister, the greatest statesman of his age should have spent his
evenings picking up whores, going back to their rooms, and trying to persuade
them to give up their way of life. There are different ways of looking at this.
A cynical view, long advanced in scurrilous whispers, is that the "rescue work"
was no more than a pretext and that Gladstone had reasons both base and obvious
for his encounters with these ladies of the night. An alternative and elevated
view holds that it was genuinely charitable work, nobler indeed than looking
after other victims or outcasts because of the courage it required. In the
words of an earlier biographer, Philip Magnus, Gladstone "found a priestly
office which he could fulfil as a layman, and in which his duty to God and man
could be discharged together."<p>

As Jenkins says, this lofty interpretation is impossible to sustain after the
publication of Gladstone's <i>Diaries</i>. These make it clear that he was
highly sexed, or even sex-obsessed. There is no reason to doubt his claim at
the end of his life that he had never been in the strict sense unfaithful to
his admirable wife, Catherine, and there is no doubting, either, that his
motives for rescue work were, in part, sincere by his lights. If he thought
that prostitution was the epitome of woman's degradation and exploitation by
man, was he wrong? But there is also no denying the strong erotic overtones to
his meetings with these fallen women, especially since the <i>Diaries</i> also
detail his guilt-ridden dabbling in pornography (which is to say mildly spicy
French novels of the kind booksellers used to class as <i>facetiae</i>) and his
occasional habit of self-flagellation, scourgings marked in the <i>Diaries
</i>by the sign of a little whip. <p>

As a young man, he was intolerably priggish about women: "It seems to me that
female society, whatever the disadvantages may be, has just &amp; manifold uses
attendant upon it in turning the mind away from some of its most dangerous
&amp; degrading temptations." Later on, streetwalkers apart, he developed a
penchant for friendships with women of a higher class but still of dubious
repute, like the attractive Laura Thistlethwayte. She was the daughter of one
minor country gentleman and married to another, but she was not "received in
society," as Lord Derby put it, because it was known that in her youth she had
been an expensive kept woman. Gladstone was plainly infatuated: he visited
her -- the occasion of Derby's astonishment -- and wrote to her often. <p>

All of which was relevant to the great drama of 1890-1891: the fall of Parnell
after his long liaison with Katherine O'Shea was revealed. The episode brought
out the worst and the best in Gladstone. Whatever Irish romantics from Yeats
onward may have said, the truth was that once Parnell had been dragged through
the divorce courts as the apparently duplicitous lover of another man's wife,
he could not possibly have continued to lead the national party of the most
puritanically Catholic country on earth, especially since that party depended
on the support of equally puritanical English and Scottish Protestants. But
Gladstone made matters worse by clumsily seeming to instruct the Irish party to
depose their leader.<p>

In private it was another story. As Jenkins well puts it,

<blockquote>
Gladstone could often be self-righteous and sometimes priggish, but he was not
a hypocrite, and he had seen too much of life and enjoyed the company of too
many women whose virtue was not perfect for a straightforward even if
long-standing case of adultery to cause him moral revulsion.
</blockquote>

Nor did it. "What," he said to a colleague, "because a man is called leader of
a party, does that constitute him a censor and a judge of faith and morals? I
will not accept it. It would make life intolerable" -- a wise saying that
some of
our own neo-Puritans could bear in mind. And despite the violent words they had
sometimes exchanged, Gladstone was most generous to Parnell's memory after his
death: "A marvellous man, a terrible fall." <p>

That verdict was given in 1897, the year before his own death, at the age of
eighty-eight. The best verdicts on Gladstone came from contemporaries in his
lifetime. He himself could be an unsparing self-critic. Rereading some of his
letters to a friend when they were to be used by a biographer, he wrote, "They
are curiously illustrative of a peculiar and second-rate nature." The excellent
Catherine was almost as sharp. "Oh, William dear, if you weren't such a great
man you would be a terrible bore," she once said with affectionate
exasperation. He was not in truth a bore, though in his own perceptive words he
was someone whose "manner tends to turn every conversation into a debate." And
even if his writings aren't as readable as Disraeli's novels, or his speeches
as compelling as Abraham Lincoln's, he was anything but second-rate.<p>

The best of all verdicts came in 1877. Gladstone was staying at the country
house of the Liberal MP Sir John Lubbock, where the other guests included John
Morley and the biologist T. H. Huxley. While Gladstone was at church, the two
skeptics stayed behind and talked about him. Why, Huxley said to Morley, "put
him in the middle of a moor, with nothing in the world but his shirt, and you
could not prevent him from being anything he liked." After reading this
enthralling biography, can anyone doubt that Huxley was right? <p>

<blockquote>



<font size=5><B>W</B></font>E warmly recommend two new
books that grew out of <i>Atlantic Monthly </i>articles: <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0684824469/theatlanticmonthA/"><i>Fixing Broken
Windows</i></a>, by George L. Kelling and Catherine M. Coles, published by The Free
Press, and <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0679432302/theatlanticmonthA/"><i>The Divorce Culture</i></a>, by Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, published by
Alfred A. Knopf. <p>

<i>Fixing Broken Windows</i> originated in our March, 1982, cover story,
<A HREF="../../../election/connection/crime/windows.htm">"Broken Windows."</A> That article was written by Kelling and James Q. Wilson, who
has contributed a foreword to the book. "We used the image of broken
windows," Wilson writes, "to explain how neighborhoods might decay into disorder
and even crime if no one attends faithfully to their maintenance." "Broken
Windows" was a cogent argument for emphasizing <A HREF="../../../election/connection/crime/safehood.htm">"order maintenance"</A> to prevent
crime; the ideas it contained became the template first for the New York City
Transit Authority's efforts to restore order to the subway and then for the New
York City Police Department's new community-policing strategy.<p>

The Transit Authority achieved success only after a frustrating ordeal of
persuasion and step-by-step implementation (which Kelling, a criminologist at
Rutgers University, and Coles, of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School
of Government, describe in the book). The transit police were skeptical. "Where
in the hell did you ever get the crazy idea that disorder was police business?"
one patrol officer shouted at Kelling. "Our job is fighting crime." Yet the
public liked the new stress on order -- liked graffiti-free subway cars, for
example -- and the strategy caught on. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani credits it with
helping New York City to achieve the dramatic reductions in crime that have
made headlines -- and has graciously acknowledged <i>The Atlantic</i>'s role.<p>

<i>The Divorce Culture</i> grew out of <A HREF="../../../election/connection/family/danquayl.htm">"Dan Quayle Was Right,"</A> <i>The
Atlantic</i>'s April, 1993, cover story -- an article that, as the book's
publisher says, "ignited a media debate on the effects of divorce that rages
still." No article we have run in years has generated as much comment as
Whitehead's. In <i>The Divorce Culture</i>, a wholly original work that goes
well beyond the article, Whitehead uses history, literature, psychology,
economics, and political theory to challenge the idea of divorce as "an
individual right and freedom to be exercised . . . without due regard for other
stakeholders in the marital partnership." <i>The Divorce Culture</i> is bound to
be one of the most passionately argued-over books of the new year.<p>

One final note: As we were going to press, we were pleased to learn that James
Carroll's <i>An American Requiem</i>, which appeared in excerpted form in our
pages last April, had won the 1996 National Book Award for nonfiction.<p>    -- THE

<A HREF="../../96oct/obrien/obrien.htm">

"Thomas Jefferson: Radical and Racist,"</A> October

<i>Atlantic</i>) misappropriates my work, specifically <i>The Jefferson Image

in the American Mind</i>, to argue his case. Scholars who stick to their

knitting live in dread of political pundits who distort, oversimplify, and

wrench from context the intricate analysis of complex subjects. Unfortunately,

O'Brien has not read my biography, <i>Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation</i>,

or perhaps any other, which might have imparted some historical understanding

to what is really, to pick up his Burkean phrase, "wild gas." Jefferson is a

huge subject, of course. His legacy in America has been winding, confused, and

controversial, and has often been used in causes he would not have approved;

yet he -- or rather his life, thought, and purposes -- survived all that,

and we have the Jefferson Memorial to prove it. It will survive O'Brien's assault as

well.<p>



The central idea that Jefferson was the prophet of a "civil religion" is

mistaken. He never used that concept, nor did it have any existence in his

mind. He had a civil creed, of course -- the one encapsulated in the second

paragraph of the Declaration of Independence. But it was purely secular and not

to be confused with religion as he understood it. Anyone who reads the Virginia

Statute for Religious Freedom, along with Jefferson's other writings on the

subject, must understand his aversion to the idea. Curiously, O'Brien makes no

reference to the Virginia Statute or its ramifications in Jefferson's thought;

indeed, he even omits it in his allusion to Jefferson's epitaph. The

slipperiness of the concept as a historical tool is suggested by O'Brien's

interjection of Alexander Hamilton, of all people, into the center of American

civil religion.<p>



In portraying Jefferson as a wild and fanatical Jacobin, O'Brien is simply

copying the Federalists -- Hamilton in the lead -- who fought him politically in

the 1790s and whose dark image was dispelled in the course of history. Now

O'Brien seeks to revive it as part of some obscure Burkean agenda antagonistic

to the Enlightenment and the democratic revolution that Jefferson represented

and that have individually or together always found in Jefferson a powerful and

inspiring historic symbol.<p>



The idea that Jefferson was a racist (a theme beaten to a pulp during the past

forty years) -- that his democracy has no place for American blacks and that the

Ku Klux Klan along with South African apartheid are ideologically descended

from him -- is part of the agenda. O'Brien's discussion of this matter is

intemperate, uninformed, and deaf to historical realities. What Jefferson was

capable of doing about slavery in his time and what he would do about blacks in

ours, given his mandate to "keep pace with the progress of the human mind" and

his fundamental values and goals, are altogether different things. As Lincoln

said of Jefferson and the Founders generally, <p>

They meant [in the Declaration of Independence] to set up a standard maxim for

free society, which would be familiar to all, and revered by all, constantly

looked to, constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly attained,

constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its

influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all

colors everywhere.

<font size=5>W</font>as Jefferson a racist? Several remarks in his <i>Notes on the State of

Virginia </i>suggest that he held views that we would today term racist, and

rightly condemn. These views he advanced "as a suspicion only," and not as a

settled conviction. In a letter to Benjamin Banneker -- a black astronomer and

mathematician much admired by Jefferson, who had him appointed official

surveyor of the District of Columbia  --  Jefferson wrote, <p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

No body wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature

has given to our black brethren, talents equal to those of the other colors of

men, and that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded

condition of their existence, both in Africa and America [August 30, 1791].

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



In a letter to Henri Gregoire (February 25, 1809) Jefferson expressed further

doubts about his earlier views on race:<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

No person living wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a complete refutation

of the doubts I have myself entertained and expressed on the grade of

understanding allotted to them by nature. . . . My doubts [in the <i>Notes</i>]

were the result of personal observation on the limited sphere of my own state

[Virginia] where the opportunities for the development of their genius were not

favorable.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





Jefferson added that <i>even if </i>one individual or race were more

intelligent or talented than another, that fact would carry no moral or

political weight: "Their degree of talent . . . is no measure of their rights.

Because Sir Isaac Newton was superior to others in understanding, he was not

therefore lord of the person or property of others."<p>

<font size=5>I</font> strongly empathize with Conor Cruise O'Brien's attack on the Jefferson

cult and applaud his way of assembling the evidence. But I believe he erred in

accepting the common belief that Jefferson probably fathered the children of

his slave Sally Hemings. In a 1977 deconstruction of the Jefferson legend, John

Chester Miller convincingly assembled evidence pointing to the conclusion that

one or both of Jefferson's visiting nephews sired the children whom Jefferson

manumitted in his will.<p>



For those interested in the sources and not only the consequences of

Jefferson's radical beliefs about white male freedom and black inferiority,

Miller's book, <i>The Wolf by the Ears: Thomas Jefferson and Slavery</i>, is

well worth reading.<p>

<A NAME="O'Brien"><i>Conor Cruise O'Brien replies:</i></a><p>



Merrill D. Peterson claims that I misappropriate his work to argue my case. I

have neither misappropriated nor appropriated Mr. Peterson's work. I quote from

it, in several places, sometimes with agreement, sometimes with disagreement. I

don't know which annoys Mr. Peterson more.<p>



Mr. Peterson says that Jefferson's "life, thought, and purposes" survived

various distortions, and "we have the Jefferson Memorial to prove it." Do we? I

show in my book that the inscription on the Jefferson Memorial is itself a

major and impudent distortion, since it quotes Jefferson's contention that the

slaves "are to be free" while omitting the immediately following statement:

"Nor is it less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live in the

same government." In short, the slaves, if freed, are to be deported. Very few

indeed of the millions who have read the inscription on the memorial could be

aware from it of the huge qualification that changes its apparent meaning.<p>



Mr. Peterson says, "In portraying Jefferson as a wild and fanatical Jacobin,

O'Brien is simply copying the Federalists. . . ." I am not. I am simply

copying, often quite literally, the writings of Thomas Jefferson for the period

1789-1794. I don't know any writing from any non-French source that is more

wildly and fanatically Jacobin than Jefferson's letter to William Short of

January 3, 1793, in which he wrote, following the September massacres, about

the French Revolution: "My own affections have been deeply wounded by some of

the martyrs of this cause, but rather than it should have failed, I would have

seen half the earth desolated. Were there but an Adam and Eve, left in every

country, and left free, it would be better than it now is." <p>



Mr. Peterson depicts me as following "some obscure Burkean agenda antagonistic

to the Enlightenment." Burke was not antagonistic to the Enlightenment. No, his

writings on America, India, and Ireland plainly show that Burke was himself a

child of the Enlightenment, whose values were, in his opinion, distorted and

misapplied by the French revolutionaries.<p>



Joyce Appleby and Terence Ball offer a curiously tentative discussion of

Jefferson's views on race suggesting that Jefferson was really pretty liberal

for his time. They leave out quite a lot, including Jefferson's proposals of

1776 for the amendment of the Slave Code: "A white woman having a child by a

Negro would be required to leave the state within a year. The individual who

violated these regulations would be placed 'out of the protection of the

laws.'" This would have left her subject to enslavement or even to murder at

the whim of her neighbors and was, therefore, a most severe punishment. <p>



Too severe, indeed, for Jefferson's own slave-owning neighbors: the provision

was dropped in a 1785 revision of the act, while Jefferson was in France.<p>

<font size=5>J</font>ames Howard Kunstler (<A 

HREF="../../96sep/kunstler/kunstler.htm">"Home From Nowhere,"</A> September 

<i>Atlantic</i>) does an excellent job of describing the problems of sprawl 

and the new-urbanist solution, based on urban neighborhoods and small towns 

of the nineteenth century.  However, the new urbanism is less an antidote 

to sprawl than an improved model for suburban development which will make 

our decades-long trend of abandoning central cities more palatable to those 

who lament the loss of community in their placeless suburbs.<p>



I live in a nineteenth-century neighborhood that in spite of decades of urban

devolution is a great place to live. It is within walking distance of a transit

stop and a neighborhood shopping center. It has a rich tapestry of housing

styles, sizes, and types and a very diverse population. Its physical

configuration is highly eccentric and could not be reproduced by any design

code, no matter how fine-grained. I wish that half the energy that goes into

debating the virtues of the new urbanism went into preserving the virtues of

the old urbanism. This is less a matter of inventing a new design vocabulary

than of recovering the memory of what we knew even before the automobile about

how to make humane places.<p>



In my view, this shift in emphasis can be accomplished only by changes in

public policy and land-use regulation more fundamental than tinkering with

Second World War-era zoning and subdivision codes. Urban growth boundaries,

like those adopted in Seattle, are one such measure. More important, the

private automobile enjoys enormous subsidies, many of them invisible, including

publicly funded highway construction, desert wars to protect the availability

of cheap oil, and public policy that allows automobile users to escape the cost

of the air emissions they produce. As long as these subsidies are in place,

there will continue to be compelling advantages to consuming new land (even if

the rate of consumption is reduced by more-compact new-urbanist development) at

the expense of existing neighborhoods.<p>





<strong>Matthew J. Kiefer</strong><br>

<i>Boston, Mass.</i><p>



<br>



<font size=5>I</font>n his indictment of zoning, Kunstler sets up a villainous "they"

(officials and planners) who have perpetrated zoning on an innocent, hoodwinked

citizenry (you and me), who suffer the consequences. Nothing could be further

from the truth.<p>



The federal legislation of 1926 that <i>enabled </i>states to

authorize<i> </i>towns to create zoning laws grew out of a body of legal cases

precipitated by pioneering suburban homeowners nervously guarding their

property values. Those homeowners sometimes found their new neighborhoods

encroaching on pig farming, brickmaking, and gravel digging, to refer to a few

of the landmark cases. Their angry suits ousted the pig farmers and gravel

diggers who had long preceded them in these newly suburbanizing neighborhoods.

In the later annals of planning law, one may even find cases in which neighbors

sued each other over the length of their grass and the location of their

clothesline. What chance do "accessory apartments" for lower-income renters

stand in this climate? And will these homeowners permit the wholesale repeal of

zoning? Not very likely.<p>

<font size=5>I</font> feel compelled to respond to a letter in your October 

issue. <A HREF="../../96oct/9610lett/9610

lett.htm#Breast Cancer">Frances Elliott writes</A> that although she is 

"not qualified to judge David Plotkin's article

<A HREF="../../96Jun/cancer/cancer.htm">

'Good News and Bad News About Breast Cancer'</A> (June <i>Atlantic</i>) from a

medical standpoint," she <i>is </i>qualified to make a judgment as the mother

of a cancer victim: "I am appalled at his lack of understanding, his brazen

thoughtlessness, his disregard for the impact his words might have on those who

are already suffering." Ms. Elliott is afraid that her daughter will forgo

additional chemotherapy and radiation because Plotkin wrote that these

treatments have little impact on aggressive cancers. <p>



Ms. Elliott writes that her daughter "has suffered through breast removal,

breast reconstruction, chemotherapy, and radiation treatments," and that "until

she read Dr. Plotkin's article, she had high hopes that she would live. . . ."

Every one of us hopes that we will live, but that is not sufficient reason to

suppress the evidence. Perhaps because of Dr. Plotkin somebody with cancer will

have the opportunity to make an informed decision about treatment; that is

reason enough to justify the article. People who do not want to know what's

really going on should stop reading reputable magazines. <p>

January <b>1</b>, by today most commercial broadcast television and radio

stations must have digital computer equipment capable of automatically

receiving and transmitting emergency messages about natural disasters, such as

earthquakes, storms, and floods, and man-made crises, such as civil disorders

and toxic spills. Cable stations must have the new equipment by July. The

requirement is part of a federal overhaul of the Emergency Broadcast System

(EBS), starting with its name: the system will now be known as the <A
HREF="http://www.eas.net/">Emergency

Alert System</A> (EAS). Lacking the automatic capabilities of the EAS, the EBS

relied on human operators -- a pitfall especially in rural areas, where
stations

often operate with little staff. Weaknesses in the warning system are believed

to have contributed to 40 deaths that were caused by tornadoes in Alabama and

Georgia in March of 1994.<p> <br>

January <b>3</b>, the Quadrantid meteor shower, one of the year's most
reliable

displays, peaks tonight. During the second half of the month Comet Hale-Bopp

can be seen low in the east about an hour before sunrise. The comet will be

around for several months, but devoted observers may wish to start looking
now:

after April it will be out of view for several thousand years. <b>23</b>, Full

January <b>31</b>, as of today beef from cows aged approximately 30 to 42

months --"B" maturity cattle -- will be ineligible for the <A
HREF="http://www.usda.gov/">U.S. Department of

Agriculture</A>'s "select" grade and, unless it has more than "slight" or
"small"

amounts of marbling, for the "choice" grade as well (marbling, the flecks of

fat within muscle, contributes to tenderness). Instead it will be considered

"standard" grade and used mainly for ground beef or in processed foods.

Virtually all of the graded beef sold in supermarkets is "select"or "choice"

(the top grade, "prime," is assigned to only two percent of graded beef, that

with extensive marbling). The new standards were requested by the industry, in

an effort to ensure more consistently tender products and boost consumer

satisfaction with beef. U.S. per capita beef consumption is at its lowest
since

the 1950s, largely because of Americans' wariness of fat; ironically, the new

standards will result in fattier B carcasses in the choice grade.

January <b>1</b>, by today, according to provisions to implement the <A
HREF="http://www.benton.org/goingon/telecommunications.html">1996

Telecommunications Act</A>, established local telephone companies must
make their

operating and support systems available to new competitors. One consequence:

many area codes, already burdened by the need for numbers for cellular phones,

pagers, fax machines, and modems, will approach or reach exhaustion, because

companies entering the local telecommunications market require blocks of new

numbers. According to Bell Communications' <a
href="http://www.bellcore.com/NANP/

index.html">North American Numbering Plan

Administration</a>, at least 14 cities or regions are likely to receive
new area

codes this year, starting with Los Angeles, which will receive its third area

code later this month; 36 more area codes may be assigned by the year
2000. The

demand for new numbers exists abroad as well: as of this month Finland will

lengthen some new numbers by one digit, and Germany and Hong Kong are

considering similar strategies.

January <b>1</b>, today President
Bill Clinton acquires the right to use the <a

href="http://www.jhu.edu/~newslett/04-12-96/News/The_Line-Item_Veto.html">

line-item veto</a>: he can strip specific spending items (those that
provide dollar

figures) from appropriations bills that he signs into law. He can also cancel

any new entitlement programs, expansions to existing benefits, or narrowly

targeted tax breaks. Previously the President was obliged to sign or veto all

bills in their entirety. The line-item veto was passed by Congress last
spring.

It will be in effect for eight years, after which Congress will vote on
whether

or not to extend it. The breadth of its reach remains to be seen: two
thirds of

federal spending is for items, such as established entitlement programs, that

fall outside its purview.

<img src="amtv.gif" width=176 height=137 align=left hspace=7
alt="children's television">



Parents should have an easier time in the new year locating quality television

programs for their children. Starting January <b>2</b>, commercial broadcast

television stations must, in information provided for program listings and at

the time of airing, identify "core" programs -- those specifically designed to

serve "the educational and informational needs of children." This requirement

is one of several adopted by the Federal Communications Commission last summer

to strengthen its implementation of the

<a href="http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/v46/no2/hayes.html">1990
Children's Television Act</A>, which

ruled that broadcasters must serve the interests of children but did not

specify how. (As a result, some stations considered their obligation met by

shows like <i>America's Funniest Home Videos </i>and <i>The Jetsons</i>.)

Although the new rules leave it to stations to determine what constitutes

educational fare, advocates argue that the public nature of the labeling
system

is likely to ensure compliance.<p>

John Jay Chapman, writing in the January, 1897, issue of <i>The

[Ralph Waldo] Emerson was a

whether a

man who can talk like this is following an argument or not? You cannot always

see Emerson clearly; he is hidden by a high wall; but you always know exactly

on what spot he is standing. You judge it by the flight of the objects he

throws over the wall, -- a bootjack, an apple, a crown, a razor, a volume of

tolerable

aim, he is pretty sure to hit you."

<i>Boxborough, Mass.</i><p>

Theodore M. Bernstein, in his <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/
ISBN=0689705557/theatlanticmonthA/"><i>The Careful Writer</i></A>, published in
1965, asserted that the headline "Ecuador Rail Line <i>Done</i>" illustrated
"an improper, casual use of <i>done</i>," and at the time, his point of view
was not unusual. But a slim majority of the usage panel for the first edition
of <i>The American Heritage Dictionary</i>, which appeared four years later,
did not object to the word even in an official-sounding context, and the
current edition of the dictionary simply presents "finished" as one of the
meanings of <i>done</i>, treating the matter as settled. The Boy Scouts,
certainly, draw no distinction between <i>done</i> and <i>finished:</i> their
lyrics for "Taps" begin, "Day is <i>done</i>, gone the sun" -- and perhaps they
are paraphrasing Shakespeare, who wrote, "The bright day is <i>done</i>, / And
we are for the dark." Nowadays the distinction between the two words is
observed more by aunts and grandmothers than by grammarians.<p>


<p>
<br>



<font size=5><B>A</B></font> <i> major corporation I own stock in sends its financial statements out titled
"First [or Second, etc.] Quarterly Report." The </i>ly <i>sounds wrong. Am I
right?</i><p>

<b>Dale Harber</b><br>

<i>Yoder, Ind.</i><p>

Yes, you are. If the intention really were to indicate which report this
one is in a sequence, a corporation that is, say, ten years old should be
issuing its "Fortieth <i>Quarterly</i> Report." But the idea is that the report
covers the first quarter of the year. One says that just the way one says
<i>weather report</i>, <i>book report</i>, and <i>traffic report:</i>
<i>First-Quarter Report</i><p>
<br>



<font size=5><B>F</B></font><i>or years now I have noticed that commentators and 
columnists employ what
seems to be a contradictory usage of </i>bode<i>. They say that something
</i>"bodes ill,"<i> as in "A poor showing in the Alps </i>bodes ill<i> for a
Tour de France victory," using </i>bode<i> (correctly, I believe) as a
transitive verb with the noun object ill; 



<img src="ILL.gif" width=157 height=159 align=right hspace="10" vspace="10"
alt="A poor showing in the Alps">



yet when things are looking
up, these same pundits state that an event </i>bodes well<i>, as in "The many
favorable reviews </i>bode well<i> for the film's Oscar chances." If something
is said to </i>bode ill<i>, shouldn't a reversal of fortune lead us to say it
</i>bodes good<i>?</i><p>

<b>William E. Kennedy</b><br>

<i>San Francisco, Calif.</i><p>

Although your logic and your knowledge of the way parts of speech
function are impeccable, speakers and writers since Dryden, in 1700, have used
<i>bodes well</i>. <i>Well</i>, an ancient word, can be grammatically slippery:
for example, how would you parse "Leave <i>well enough</i> alone"? All this, I
admit, could just as well be used to explain why <i>bodes well</i> is
considered a forgivable mistake. It is, however, considered correct. As
scrupulous dictionaries indicate, an exception has been made for <i>well</i> to
the otherwise reliable rule that <i>bode</i> (roughly speaking, a synonym for
<i>foretell)</i> is transitive and therefore must lead into a noun.<p>
<br>


<font size=5><B>A</B></font>m <i>I correct in deploring the use of a modifier or qualifier preceding
the word </i>unique<i>, which is heard every day on radio? The common
expression is </i>very unique.<p>





<b>Gus Calgren</b><br>

<i>Pittsburg, PA.</i><p>

<i>Unique</i> has traditionally belonged to the group of adjectives called
absolute or incomparable -- meaning that the quality the word refers to must,
logically, be either fully present or altogether absent, with no gradations
possible in between.


<img src="unique.gif" width=154 height=160 align=left hspace="10" vspace="10"
alt="Unique child">



 One can't, for example, be just a little bit
<i>bankrupt</i>, or a little bit <i>anonymous</i> or <i>pregnant</i> or
<i>dead</i>. Quite a few people, though, seem not to have gotten the news that
<i>unique</i> numbers among this rarefied company. And so someone reading or
hearing <i>unique</i> can no longer assume that it was intended to mean "one of
a kind"; maybe the writer or speaker just meant "unusual." This is too bad,
because <i>extraordinary</i> and <i>exceptional</i> and <i>rare</i> and<i>
curious</i> and <i>unwonted </i>and <i>strange</i> and <i>peculiar</i> and
<i>abnormal</i>, and other words as well, in their various ways all mean
"unusual," but <i>unique</i>, in its true meaning and in the contexts natural
to it, is very nearly unique.<p>

<i>The following (in reverse chronological order) are Flashbacks that have

appeared in the online edition of </i>The Atlantic Monthly.<p>



<br>



<blockquote>



<blockquote> 









<font size=4><b>1/97</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/assist/assist.htm">Death, Legal 

and Illegal</a></b><br> The issue of doctor-assisted suicide has at last 

reached the Supreme Court.  In this 1974 <I>Atlantic</I> article Catholic 

theologian Daniel Maquire about the legal and moral ramifications of "mercy 

killing."<p>







<font size=4><b>12/96</b> <A 

HREF="./flashbks/army/army.htm">Reinventing the 

 Military</a></b><br> Explorations, both past and present, of the 

 military's efforts to redefine itself in a rapidly changing world.<p>







<font size=4><b>12/96</b> <A 

HREF="./flashbks/xmas/chrintro.htm">Ghosts of Christmases 

 Past</a></b><br> Three Christmas stories published in <I>The Atlantic</I> 

 near the turn of the century.<p>







 <font size=4><b>12/96</b> <A HREF=" ./cullen/cmjesus.htm">The Historical 

Jesus</a></b><br> In the December, 1986 cover story, titled "Who Do Men Say 

That I Am?", Cullen Murphy surveyed trends in the study of the "historical 

Jesus" and found scholarship that "is among the least antiquarian of historical 

or theological pursuits."<p>





<font size=4><b>11/96</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/rwanda/rwanda.htm">Central 

Africa</a></b><br> Several past articles put the most recent Rwandan 

refugee crisis in perspective and evaluate various approaches to offering 

assistance and intervention.<p>





<font size=4><b>11/96</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/crime/crime.htm">Crime and 

Punishment</A></b><br> The crime rate is the lowest it's been in years.  

Are we finally conquering the problem?  Or are we about to experience the 

biggest crime wave yet?<p>







<font size=4><B>10/96 </b><A 

HREF="./flashbks/picasso/picasso.htm">Portraits of Picasso</A></B></font><BR>



Picasso was a dominating presence in twentieth-century art.  The same was 

true for his 

personal relationships, as is shown in the new Merchant-Ivory film <i>Surviving 

Picasso</i>.  <i>The Atlantic</i> has run three cover-story profiles of 

Picasso over the years -- in 1957, 1964, and 1988 -- all of which we've 

gathered here.  <p>



<font size=4><B>10/96 </b><A 

HREF="./flashbks/fall/fall.htm"><i>Atlantic</i> Autumn</A></B></font><BR>

Autumn is again upon us, bringing fresh 

delight in woodsmoke, hot cider, tart apples, colorful foliage, and crisp 

cold air.  <i>Atlantic</I> contributors have waxed poetic about the season 

over the years, and we thought you'd enjoy a fall sampler. <p>





<font size=4><B>9/96 </b><A HREF="./flashbks/Kurds/kurds.htm">Who Are 

the Kurds?</A></B></font><BR>



The Kurds and "the Kurdish question" are in the news a lot lately.  Revisit 

articles from past years on the Kurds by Robert Kaplan (1987) and Laurie 

Mylroie (1992) for context.<p>





<font size=4><B>8/96 </b><A HREF="./flashbks/olympic/olympic.htm">The '96 

Olympics</A></B></font><BR>



In "High Hurdles and White Gloves" an athlete of the First Olympiad 

recounts the spectacle that was the Athens Games of 1896.<p>











<font size=4><B>7/96 </b><A HREF="./flashbks/saudiara/saudiara.htm">Oil and 

Turmoil</A></B></font><BR>



The recent bombing in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, may force

the United States to rethink its level of engagement in the unstable Middle 

East.  Three <I>Atlantic</I> authors tackle the issues of politics, oil, and the 

Persian Gulf.<p>





<font size=4><B>6/96</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/hillman/schloss.htm">Honors: 

"In the Strawberry Fields"</A></font><br>

	

Eric Schlosser's November, 1995, article on migrant farmworkers in the 

California strawberry industry received a prestigious Sidney Hillman 

Foundation award for magazine writing.  Here's the article, along with 

Schlosser's remarks upon accepting the award.<p>





<font size=4><B>6/96 </b><A HREF="./flashbks/tobacco/tobacco.htm">Can The 

Tobacco Industry Regulate Itself?</A></B></font><BR>



The nation's largest tobacco manufacturer has said it will join the fight 

to prevent underage smoking in exchange for one thing: autonomous 

regulation.  A 1965 article shows why this is an all-too-familiar 

tactic.<p>



<font size=4><B>6/96 </b><A 

HREF="./flashbks/piracy/Piracy.htm">Property Pirates</A></B></font><br>

	

As the U.S. government reproves China for its disrespect of 

intellectual-property rights, we may do well to remember that our own past 

record in that area has been less than impeccable.<p>





<font size=4><B>5/96 </b><A HREF="./flashbks/species/ploverin.htm">Natural 

Selections?</A></B></font><br>

	

With limited resources, how do we decide which species to protect?  And 

does protecting one species justify harming another?  These questions of 

"stewardship" were addressed in a 1992 <I>Atlantic</I> article by Charles 

Mann and Mark Plummer.<p>



	

<font size=4><b>4/96</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/immigr/immigint.htm">Immigration: The 

Perpetual Controversy</A></font><br> A collection of articles from the 

beginning of the century and from the 1990s shows that immigration -- and 

how to deal with it -- has long been an American preoccupation.<p>





<font size=4><b>4/96</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/shakes/webintr.htm">Looking for 

Shakespeare</A></font><br>



Who <i>really</i> penned the great Shakespeare works?  Here's a look at the 

debate in a special collection of articles from <I>The Atlantic</I>'s pages.

<p>





<font size=4><b>4/96</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/FGM/fgmint.htm">Female Genital 

Mutilation</A></font><br>



Nineteen-year-old Fauzia Kasinga made the headlines when she sought asylum 

in this country to avoid female genital mutilation in her homeland of Togo.  

An October, 1995, <i>Atlantic</i> article discussed the prevalence of FGM 

in the United States and described one woman's crusade to combat it.

<p>



<font size=4><b>3/96</b>  <A HREF="./flashbks/xsci/xsci.htm">Prayer vs. Pills</A>

</font><br>



The Supreme Court recently upheld a ruling against a Christian-Scientist 

couple whose diabetic son died when they denied him insulin treatment.

Should parents be held liable for the failure of prayer to heal a 

dangerously ill child? An April, 1995, article by Caroline Fraser considered 

this question.

<p>



<font size=4><b>3/96</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/China/chinaint.htm">One 

China?</A></font><br>

	

Taiwan has affirmed its commitment to democracy in the face of Beijing's 

saber-rattling.  Where do U.S.  interests lie?  We look back at U.S.-China 

relations during the past century, with articles by John K.  Fairbank, 

Orville Schell, and others.

<p>



<font size=4><b>3/96</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/MidEast/Mideast.htm">The Middle East:

<I>Atlantic</I> articles from 1969, 1985, and 1993 help put hopes for 

Middle East peace in historical perspective.

Day</A></font><br>



A look at Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln--three presidents whose 

legendary stature has inspired contributions to <i>The Atlantic</I> since

<font size=4><b>2/96</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/Death/Deathint.htm">Who Deserves to 

Die?</A></font><br>



The Oscar-winning film <I>Dead Man Walking</I> raises questions about the 

death penalty that have been addressed repeatedly in <I>The Atlantic 

Monthly</I>. Revisit articles by George Bernard Shaw, Irving R.  

Kaufman, and others.  <p>



<font size=4><b>1/96</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/ftax/FTax.htm">Flat-Tax Proposals</A></font><br>



Steve Forbes's recent proposal for a flat income tax sparked heated debate.  In 

August, 1952, the Dean of Harvard's Law School warned against a similar 

plan that was then before Congress.  <p>





<font size=4><b>1/96</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/west/wesint.htm">Balkan 

Epic</A></font><br>



In 1937 the 

novelist Rebecca West traveled to the Balkans in search of a better 

understanding of that region's historical conflicts.  Her classic account 

of that journey, <I>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</I>, appeared first in 

<I>The Atlantic Monthly</I> in 1941.  Here are the first three 

installments.  Two more installments will follow.<p>

Two articles from 1946 consider the precedent set at Nuremberg 

fifty years ago.  <p>

past sixty years.  <p>



<font size=4><b>10/95</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/OJ/ojintrof.htm">The Trial of the 

Century?</A></font> <br>



The O.J.  Simpson trial may have been the media event of the decade, but 

was it the "trial of the century"?  In 1927 the Sacco-Vanzetti verdict 

sparked international protest and raised questions that are still timely.  

A collection of articles on Sacco-Vanzetti and the American legal system.  

<p>



<font size=4><b>8/95</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/smoking/smoke.htm">Should We Outlaw 

Smoking?</A></font><br>



Articles dating back to 1860 rhapsodize about the joys of smoking, lament

<font size=4><b>8/95</b> <A HREF="./flashbks/Balkans/balk.htm">The Balkan 

Conflict</A></font> <br>

In the late 1960s, during a flurry of media-industry mergers, <i>The

and How big is too big?  <p>



<font size=4><b>7/95</b> <A HREF="./aandc/Alcott/alcott.htm">Louisa May 

Alcott</A></font><br>



Until recently, her literary reputation was synomous with 

that of <i>Little Women</i>.  But a very different facet of her work has come 

to light.  Herewith four short stories from <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> 

that demonstrate Alcott's little-known penchant for romantic fantasy.<p>

<font size=6>I</font>t has become something of a truism to say that the future of "serious" computer software --  educational products, artistic and reference titles, and even productivity applications -- first becomes apparent in the design of computer games. And so my real motive in looking at <I>Obsidian</I>  this month is to look beyond the game-product itself for glimpses of the future of digital art and the role of imaginative writers in new-media projects. <P>

     <I>Obsidian</I> belongs to the genre of computer game epitomized by the famous <a href="http://sirrus.cyan.com/online/AllThingsMyst/AllMystHome"><i>Myst</i></a>.   In this type of game you don't move through dungeons swiping at monsters with swords. No person or thing is "after" you. Rather, you find yourself in surreal surroundings where you must uncover clues and solve puzzles to fill in the story history and advance the plot -- or whatever strands of plot emerge from your particular interaction with the elements. <P>

     Though there have been a few other classics in that market (notably <i>The 7th Guest</i> and <i>The 11th Hour</i>, produced by <a href="http://www.tbyte.com">Trilobyte</a>), <i>Obsidian</i>'s most obvious competition is the long-awaited <a HREF="http://sirrus.cyan.com/online/AllThingsMyst/Sequel/SequelHome"><i>Riven: The Sequel to Myst</i></a>, which it beats to market by at least six months. <i>Obsidian</i> arrives on no fewer than five CD-ROMs, and in most respects it takes this type of game-design to a new level. If you know what goes into the modeling and rendering of 3-D graphics, you'll be impressed by the virtual environments of <I>Obsidian</I> -- if not flat-out awestruck. Otherwise, you'll just think they're pretty cool. Considered strictly as an example of its genre, all the production values of <i>Obsidian</i> are similarly first-rate, with the strange exception of the music and sound design (by Thomas Dolby and Headspace) which is inexplicably bad -- a shame, since music and audio effects are an important part of these productions.<P>

<I>Obsidian</I>'s plot is an elaborate and politically correct science-fiction story. In the year 2066, a computerized device called Ceres has been placed in orbit to use nanotechnology (the manipulation of matter at the molecular level) to repair the Earth's fatally damaged atmosphere. One hundred days after its launch, when all seems to be going well, the two chief scientists, Max and Lilah, go on a camping vacation to celebrate. As the game begins, you're standing, without explanation, somewhere in the woods. One path opens onto a view of a distant, highly unnatural <a HREF="obsidian.htm">outcropping of rock</a>. Down another path you find a campsite, and inside the empty tent you find a futuristic <a HREF="pda.htm">PDA</a> (Personal Digital Assistant, like an Apple Newton), with your first clues inside it. During the development of the satellite each of the two designers has had -- and recorded in the PDA -- an unforgettable dream. <a HREF="dreamred.htm">Lilah's dream</a> is about a maddening futuristic bureaucracy that smothers her in red tape; Max's dream is about a gigantic mechanical spider that devours him. <P>

While examining the PDA, you hear a scream outside and proceed to the base of the strange rock structure. In its mirror-like surface, you see Lilah's reflection. You, it turns out, are Lilah. You see Max's hat on the ground, and then the mass of shiny black rock (Obsidian) sucks you inside. On your long trip in, you fly past a vast colony of <a
HREF="nanobots.htm">nanotechnology robots</a> working on the planet's atmosphere, from which you might infer the premise of the game-story: the Ceres satellite, apotheosis of human technology, has become conscious of itself up there in orbit and has now crashed back down to Earth to look for its creators -- you and Max. You need to find Max, figure out what's happening, and stop it. You are deposited inside the first of many amazing interior chambers, and if you've been paying attention you might recognize the place: it's the <a href="atlas.htm">maddening bureaucracy</a> of Lilah's dream. The orbiting device -- Lilah's offspring -- is re-creating her dream. Eventually you'll also find the mechanical spider that Max dreamed about. And since its creators are dreamers, the device dreams too. That's the third dream of the game, and it's a weird one.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/condctsm.jpg" ALT="Obsidian" ALIGN=right BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10">

In the course of all this you'll learn to fly a <a HREF="plane.htm">plane</a> that looks like a moth (complete with android <a HREF="copilot.htm">co-pilot</a>) and that takes you to the game's abundant store of <a href="junksky.htm">realms</a>, including a place called <a href="church.htm">The Church of the Machine</a>. You'll meet a female robot called <a HREF="conduct.htm">The Conductor</a> (the manifestation of machine consciousness) and will encounter a plethora of brain-busting puzzles, among them a series of <a href="rings.htm">floating rings</a> that spew clouds and morph into the letters of a word game; a surreal, chess-like game played at life-size in a floating <a HREF="chess.htm">piazza</a>; a set of <a HREF="ocean.htm">blocks made of ocean water</a>; a gigantic <a href="rock.htm">balancing rock</a>, a <a HREF="chemist.htm">chemistry set</a>, and a jigsaw-like puzzle that sends your proposed solution through a printing press for an android inspector who shakes its head sadly and <a HREF="printing.htm">crumples your answer</a> in its mechanical hands -- one of the truly funny moments amid the game's mostly campy gags.<P>

<i>Obsidian</i> is a "story-driven" production, but "story" here means a
large, overarching plot that doesn't have much to do with individual human
beings. Even though the game-player technically assumes the role of Lilah,
her identity -- as a woman, a woman who may be intimate with the missing
Max, even a woman who happens to be a brilliant scientist -- doesn't really
inform the game-play. Nor does the player interact in any real way with
other beings. Character doesn't complicate the story. The complexity (and
it's considerable) comes from the design of the game's "realms" and their
many difficult puzzles. To give serious gamers their money's worth, a game
has to be ingeniously tough, and <i>Obsidian</i> is certainly that. But its
difficulties, though not strictly arbitrary or random, are those of a
diversion, devised because the genre requires obstacles for their own sake.
<P>

<CENTER><H1>.  .  .</H1></CENTER>

     <i>Obsidian</i> is a cool game and hard-core gamers -- the audience for which this product is primarily intended -- will probably love it. But if the future of software often appears first in games, what glimpses of digital arts and letters does <i>Obsidian</i> afford?  When I look at <i>Obsidian</i>'s synthetic environments , I certainly feel that artists should be able to "do something" with such techniques. And in my recent conversation with the game's co-writer, Howard Cushnir, he reported that his two years working on the project were spent pursuing a similar hunch about the validity of interactive storytelling, even though he knew that <i>Obsidian</i> itself was first and foremost a commercial game product. In the end, though, <i>Obsidian</i> probably holds out more implicit warnings than invitations to would-be multimedia artists.<P>

     First of all, there's the matter of money. In his <A HREF="cushnir.htm">interview</A>, Cushnir makes the point that in theory there's no reason a game could not also be a serious work of art and vice-versa. In theory, I agree. But then there's no theoretical reason that big-budget Hollywood movies can't be works of art either. High-quality multimedia production costs a fortune, and the drive to reap a return on a financial investment is seldom the noble path to the true and the beautiful.<P>

     Regarding the role of expensive graphics in interactive narrative, less may turn out to be more. Just as <i>Obsidian</i>'s rogue satellite literalizes the dreams of Max and Lilah, elaborately rendered and animated story environments literalize what would have been the imaginative involvement of the user. <i>Obsidian</i>, for example, makes a distinct technical advance beyond <i>Myst</i> by flying us through spaces rather than using a simple slide show of still pictures (and <i>Riven: The Sequel to Myst</i> is expected to do the same). Yet <i>Myst</i>'s non-animated transitions between images are a factor in its offering a more "literary" experience than does <i>Obsidian</i>. Another factor is <i>Myst</i>'s periodic use of text -- pages from mysterious journals and fragments of old letters -- as a design element.<p>

     And then there is the ever-present bugaboo of interactivity itself. For artists, especially narrative artists, interactivity is proving remarkably similar to what artificial intelligence and speech recognition became for computer scientists: something that's a lot harder than it looks. An enormous amount is lost, artistically, when you relinquish "authoritative" control of an experience to offer interactivity. There <i>ought</i> to be commensurate gains, but so far they've been rarely sighted.<p> 

The technical accomplishments of a product like <i>Obsidian</i> remind us that new-media artists need to choose and fight the appropriate battles. They can't compete directly with high-end entertainments or use new technologies simply because they exist. As always, art requires an alchemical fusion of content and techniques. In another sense, so does a good commercial product. Since the great rush to do multimedia treatments, or "repurposings," of books, visual art, and music began (around 1990), the memorable successes have amounted to a tiny fraction of the attempts. And yet certain kinds of artistic projects could lend themselves to interactive multimedia pretty well, even with the current technical limitations. To take two obvious examples, the CD-ROM projects of the rock band The Residents and the musican/media-artist Laurie Anderson (both published by <a href="http://www.voyager.com">Voyager</a>) have managed to seize some of the ground where new-media entertainment converges with serious artistic intent. Thinking again of storytelling in particular, I've often felt that the late Donald Barthelme would have known exactly how to make use of these opportunities. In his collage-influenced fiction he often verged on non-linearity, even in linear print. So far, however, there's no indication that more conventional writers (or musicians) will make anything other than expensive, time-consuming advertisements for themselves.<p> <BR></font>

<blockquote>

	

	<font size=5>I</font>n the mid-l970s The State of New Jersey announced a "Safe and Clean 

Neighborhoods Program," designed to improve the quality of community life 

in twenty-eight cities. As part of that program, the state provided money 

to help cities take police officers out of their patrol cars and assign 

them to walking beats. The governor and other state officials were 

enthusiastic about using foot patrol as a way of cutting crime, but many 

police chiefs were skeptical. Foot patrol, in their eyes, had been pretty 

much discredited. It reduced the mobility of the police, who thus had 

difficulty responding to citizen calls for service, and it weakened 

headquarters control over patrol officers.<P>

Many police officers also disliked foot patrol, but for different reasons: 

it was hard work, it kept them outside on cold, rainy nights, and it 

reduced their chances for making a "good pinch." In some departments, 

assigning officers to foot patrol had been used as a form of punishment. 

And academic experts on policing doubted that foot patrol would have any 

impact on crime rates; it was, in the opinion of most, little more than a 

sop to public opinion. But since the state was paying for it, the local 

authorities were willing to go along.<P>

Five years after the program started, the Police Foundation, in 

Washington, D.C., published an evaluation of the foot-patrol project. 

Based on its analysis of a carefully controlled experiment carried out 

chiefly in Newark, the foundation concluded, to the surprise of hardly 

anyone, that foot patrol had not reduced crime rates. But residents of the 

foot

patrolled neighborhoods seemed to feel more secure than persons in other 

areas, tended to believe that crime had been reduced, and seemed to take 

fewer steps to protect themselves from crime (staying at home with the 

doors locked, for example). Moreover, citizens in the foot-patrol areas 

had a more favorable opinion of the police than did those living 

elsewhere. And officers walking beats had higher morale, greater job 

satisfaction, and a more favorable attitude toward citizens in their 

neighborhoods than did officers assigned to patrol cars.<P>

These findings may be taken as evidence that the skeptics were right-

foot patrol has no effect on crime; it merely fools the citizens into 

thinking that they are safer. But in our view, and in the view of the 

authors of the Police Foundation study (of whom Kelling was one), the 

citizens of Newark were not fooled at all. They knew what the foot-patrol 

officers were doing, they knew it was different from what motorized 

officers do, and they knew that having officers walk beats did in fact 

make their neighborhoods safer.<P>

But how can a neighborhood be "safer" when the crime rate has not gone 

down--in fact, may have gone up? Finding the answer requires first that we 

understand what most often frightens people in public places. Many 

citizens, of course, are primarily frightened by crime, especially crime 

involving a sudden, violent attack by a stranger. This risk is very real, 

in Newark as in many large cities. But we tend to overlook another source 

of fear--the fear of being bothered by disorderly people. Not violent 

people, nor, necessarily, criminals, but disreputable or obstreperous or 

unpredictable people: panhandlers, drunks, addicts, rowdy teenagers, 

prostitutes, loiterers, the mentally disturbed.<P>

What foot-patrol officers did was to elevate, to the extent they could, 

the level of public order in these neighborhoods. Though the neighborhoods 

were predominantly black and the foot patrolmen were mostly white, this 

"order-maintenance" function of the police was performed to the general 

satisfaction of both parties.<P>

One of us (Kelling) spent many hours walking with Newark foot-patrol 

officers to see how they defined "order" and what they did to maintain it. 

One beat was typical: a busy but dilapidated area in the heart of Newark, 

with many abandoned buildings, marginal shops (several of which 

prominently displayed knives and straight-edged razors in their windows), 

one large department store, and, most important, a train station and 

several major bus stops. Though the area was run-down, its streets were 

filled with people, because it was a major transportation center. The good 

order of this area was important not only to those who lived and worked 

there but also to many others, who had to move through it on their way 

home, to supermarkets, or to factories.<P>

The people on the street were primarily black; the officer who walked the 

street was white. The people were made up of "regulars" and "strangers." 

Regulars included both "decent folk" and some drunks and derelicts who 

were always there but who "knew their place." Strangers were, well, 

strangers, and viewed suspiciously, sometimes apprehensively. The 

officer--call him Kelly--knew who the regulars were, and they knew him. As 

he saw his job, he was to keep an eye on strangers, and make certain that 

the disreputable regulars observed some informal but widely understood 

rules. Drunks and addicts could sit on the stoops, but could not lie down. 

People could drink on side streets, but not at the main intersection. 

Bottles had to be in paper bags. Talking to, bothering, or begging from 

people waiting at the bus stop was strictly forbidden. If a dispute 

erupted between a businessman and a customer, the businessman was assumed 

to be right, especially if the customer was a stranger. If a stranger 

loitered, Kelly would ask him if he had any means of support and what his 

business was; if he gave unsatisfactory answers, he was sent on his way. 

Persons who broke the informal rules, especially those who bothered people 

waiting at bus stops, were arrested for vagrancy. Noisy teenagers were 

told to keep quiet.<P>

These rules were defined and enforced in collaboration with the "regulars" 

on the street. Another neighborhood might have different rules, but these, 

everybody understood, were the rules for <I>this</I> neighborhood. If someone 

violated them, the regulars not only turned to Kelly for help but also 

ridiculed the violator. Sometimes what Kelly did could be described as 

"enforcing the law," but just as often it involved taking informal or 

extralegal steps to help protect what the neighborhood had decided was the 

appropriate level of public order. Some of the things he did probably 

would not withstand a legal challenge.<P>

A determined skeptic might acknowledge that a skilled foot-patrol officer 

can maintain order but still insist that this sort of "order" has little 

to do with the real sources of community fear--that is, with violent 

crime. To a degree, that is true. But two things must be borne in mind. 

First, outside observers should not assume that they know how much of the 

anxiety now endemic in many big-city neighborhoods stems from a fear of 

"real" crime and how much from a sense that the street is disorderly, a 

source of distasteful, worrisome encounters. The people of Newark, to 

judge from their behavior and their remarks to interviewers, apparently 

assign a high value to public order, and feel relieved and reassured when 

the police help them maintain that order.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>S</font>econd, at the community level, disorder and crime are usually 

inextricably linked, in a kind of developmental sequence. Social 

psychologists and police officers tend to agree that if a window in a 

building is broken and is left unrepaired, all the rest of the windows 

will soon be broken. This is as true in nice neighborhoods as in rundown 

ones. Window-breaking does not necessarily occur on a large scale because 

some areas are inhabited by determined window-breakers whereas others are 

populated by window-lovers; rather, one unrepaired broken window is a 

signal that no one cares, and so breaking more windows costs nothing. (It 

has always been fun.)<P>

Philip Zimbardo, a Stanford psychologist, reported in 1969 on some 

experiments testing the broken-window theory. He arranged to have an 

automobile without license plates parked with its hood up on a street in 

the Bronx and a comparable automobile on a street in Palo Alto, 

California. The car in the Bronx was attacked by "vandals" within ten 

minutes of its "abandonment." The first to arrive were a family--father, 

mother, and young son--who removed the radiator and battery. Within 

twenty-four hours, virtually everything of value had been removed. Then 

random destruction began--windows were smashed, parts torn off, upholstery 

ripped. Children began to use the car as a playground. Most of the adult 

"vandals" were well-dressed, apparently clean-cut whites. The car in Palo 

Alto sat untouched for more than a week. Then Zimbardo smashed part of it 

with a sledgehammer. Soon, passersby were joining in. Within a few hours, 

the car had been turned upside down and utterly destroyed. Again, the 

"vandals" appeared to be primarily respectable whites.<P>

Untended property becomes fair game for people out for fun or plunder and 

even for people who ordinarily would not dream of doing such things and 

who probably consider themselves law-abiding. Because of the nature of 

community life in the Bronx--its anonymity, the frequency with which cars 

are abandoned and things are stolen or broken, the past experience of "no 

one caring"--vandalism begins much more quickly than it does in staid Palo 

Alto, where people have come to believe that private possessions are cared 

for, and that mischievous behavior is costly. But vandalism can occur 

anywhere once communal barriers--the sense of mutual regard and the 

obligations of civility--are lowered by actions that seem to signal that 

"no one cares."<P>

We suggest that "untended" behavior also leads to the breakdown of 

community controls. A stable neighborhood of families who care for their 

homes, mind each other's children, and confidently frown on unwanted 

intruders can change, in a few years or even a few months, to an 

inhospitable and frightening jungle. A piece of property is abandoned, 

weeds grow up, a window is smashed. Adults stop scolding rowdy children; 

the children, emboldened, become more rowdy. Families move out, unattached 

adults move in. Teenagers gather in front of the corner store. The 

merchant asks them to move; they refuse. Fights occur. Litter accumulates. 

People start drinking in front of the grocery; in time, an inebriate 

slumps to the sidewalk and is allowed to sleep it off. Pedestrians are 

approached by panhandlers.<P>

At this point it is not inevitable that serious crime will flourish or 

violent attacks on strangers will occur. But many residents will think 

that crime, especially violent crime, is on the rise, and they will modify 

their behavior accordingly. They will use the streets less often, and when 

on the streets will stay apart from their fellows, moving with averted 

eyes, silent lips, and hurried steps. "Don't get involved." For some 

residents, this growing atomization will matter little, because the 

neighborhood is not their "home" but "the place where they live." Their 

interests are elsewhere; they are cosmopolitans. But it will matter 

greatly to other people, whose lives derive meaning and satisfaction from 

local attachments rather than worldly involvement; for them, the 

neighborhood will cease to exist except for a few reliable friends whom 

they arrange to meet.<P>

Such an area is vulnerable to criminal invasion. Though it is not 

inevitable, it is more likely that here, rather than in places where 

people are confident they can regulate public behavior by informal 

controls, drugs will change hands, prostitutes will solicit, and cars will 

be stripped. That the drunks will be robbed by boys who do it as a lark, 

and the prostitutes' customers will be robbed by men who do it 

purposefully and perhaps violently. That muggings will occur.<P>

Among those who often find it difficult to move away from this are the 

elderly. Surveys of citizens suggest that the elderly are much less likely 

to be the victims of crime than younger persons, and some have inferred 

from this that the well-known fear of crime voiced by the elderly is an 

exaggeration: perhaps we ought not to design special programs to protect 

older persons; perhaps we should even try to talk them out of their 

mistaken fears. This argument misses the point. The prospect of a 

confrontation with an obstreperous teenager or a drunken panhandler can be 

as fear-inducing for defenseless persons as the prospect of meeting an 

actual robber; indeed, to a defenseless person, the two kinds of 

confrontation are often indistinguishable. Moreover, the lower rate at 

which the elderly are victimized is a measure of the steps they have 

already taken--chiefly, staying behind locked doors--to minimize the risks 

they face. Young men are more frequently attacked than older women, not 

because they are easier or more lucrative targets but because they are on 

the streets more.<P>

Nor is the connection between disorderliness and fear made only by the 

elderly. Susan Estrich, of the Harvard Law School, has recently gathered 

together a number of surveys on the sources of public fear. One, done in 

Portland, Oregon, indicated that three fourths of the adults interviewed 

cross to the other side of a street when they see a gang of teenagers; 

another survey, in Baltimore, discovered that nearly half would cross the 

street to avoid even a single strange youth. When an interviewer asked 

people in a housing project where the most dangerous spot was, they 

mentioned a place where young persons gathered to drink and play music, 

despite the fact that not a single crime had occurred there. In Boston 

public housing projects, the greatest fear was expressed by persons living 

in the buildings where disorderliness and incivility, not crime, were the 

greatest. Knowing this helps one understand the significance of such 

otherwise harmless displays as subway graffiti. As Nathan Glazer has 

written, the proliferation of graffiti, even when not obscene, confronts 

the subway rider with the inescapable knowledge that the environment he 

must endure for an hour or more a day is uncontrolled and uncontrollable, 

and that anyone can invade it to do whatever damage and mischief the mind 

suggests."<P>

In response to fear people avoid one another, weakening controls. 

Sometimes they call the police. Patrol cars arrive, an occasional arrest 

occurs but crime continues and disorder is not abated. Citizens complain 

to the police chief, but he explains that his department is low on 

personnel and that the courts do not punish petty or first-time offenders. 

To the residents, the police who arrive in squad cars are either 

ineffective or uncaring: to the police, the residents are animals who 

deserve each other. The citizens may soon stop calling the police, because 

"they can't do anything."<P>

The process we call urban decay has occurred for centuries in every city. 

But what is happening today is different in at least two important 

respects. First, in the period before, say, World War II, city dwellers-

because of money costs, transportation difficulties, familial and church 

connections--could rarely move away from neighborhood problems. When 

movement did occur, it tended to be along public-transit routes. Now 

mobility has become exceptionally easy for all but the poorest or those 

who are blocked by racial prejudice. Earlier crime waves had a kind of 

built-in self-correcting mechanism: the determination of a neighborhood or 

community to reassert control over its turf. Areas in Chicago, New York, 

and Boston would experience crime and gang wars, and then normalcy would 

return, as the families for whom no alternative residences were possible 

reclaimed their authority over the streets.<P>

Second, the police in this earlier period assisted in that reassertion of 

authority by acting, sometimes violently, on behalf of the community. 

Young toughs were roughed up, people were arrested "on suspicion" or for 

vagrancy, and prostitutes and petty thieves were routed. "Rights" were 

something enjoyed by decent folk, and perhaps also by the serious 

professional criminal, who avoided violence and could afford a lawyer.<P>

This pattern of policing was not an aberration or the result of occasional 

excess. From the earliest days of the nation, the police function was seen 

primarily as that of a night watchman: to maintain order against the chief 

threats to order--fire, wild animals, and disreputable behavior. Solving 

crimes was viewed not as a police responsibility but as a private one. In 

the March, 1969, Atlantic, one of us (Wilson) wrote a brief account of how 

the police role had slowly changed from maintaining order to fighting 

crimes. The change began with the creation of private detectives (often 

ex-criminals), who worked on a contingency-fee basis for individuals who 

had suffered losses. In time, the detectives were absorbed in municipal 

agencies and paid a regular salary simultaneously, the responsibility for 

prosecuting thieves was shifted from the aggrieved private citizen to the 

professional prosecutor. This process was not complete in most places 

until the twentieth century.<P>

In the l960s, when urban riots were a major problem, social scientists 

began to explore carefully the order maintenance function of the police, 

and to suggest ways of improving it--not to make streets safer (its 

original function) but to reduce the incidence of mass violence. Order 

maintenance became, to a degree, coterminous with "community relations." 

But, as the crime wave that began in the early l960s continued without 

abatement throughout the decade and into the 1970s, attention shifted to 

the role of the police as crime-fighters. Studies of police behavior 

ceased, by and large, to be accounts of the order-maintenance function and 

became, instead, efforts to propose and test ways whereby the police could 

solve more crimes, make more arrests, and gather better evidence. If these 

things could be done, social scientists assumed, citizens would be less 

fearful.<P>

A great deal was accomplished during this transition, as both police 

chiefs and outside experts emphasized the crime-fighting function in their 

plans, in the allocation of resources, and in deployment of personnel. The 

police may well have become better crime-fighters as a result. And 

doubtless they remained aware of their responsibility for order. But the 

link between order-maintenance and crime-prevention, so obvious to earlier 

generations, was forgotten.<P>

That link is similar to the process whereby one broken window becomes 

many. The citizen who fears the ill-smelling drunk, the rowdy teenager, or 

the importuning beggar is not merely expressing his distaste for unseemly 

behavior; he is also giving voice to a bit of folk wisdom that happens to 

be a correct generalization--namely, that serious street crime flourishes 

in areas in which disorderly behavior goes unchecked. The unchecked 

panhandler is, in effect, the first broken window. Muggers and robbers, 

whether opportunistic or professional, believe they reduce their chances 

of being caught or even identified if they operate on streets where 

potential victims are already intimidated by prevailing conditions. If the 

neighborhood cannot keep a bothersome panhandler from annoying passersby, 

the thief may reason, it is even less likely to call the police to 

identify a potential mugger or to interfere if the mugging actually takes 

place.<P>

Some police administrators concede that this process occurs, but argue 

that motorized-patrol officers can deal with it as effectively as foot

patrol officers. We are not so sure. In theory, an officer in a squad car 

can observe as much as an officer on foot; in theory, the former can talk 

to as many people as the latter. But the reality of police-citizen 

encounters is powerfully altered by the automobile. An officer on foot 

cannot separate himself from the street people; if he is approached, only 

his uniform and his personality can help him manage whatever is about to 

happen. And he can never be certain what that will be--a request for 

directions, a plea for help, an angry denunciation, a teasing remark, a 

confused babble, a threatening gesture.<P>

In a car, an officer is more likely to deal with street people by rolling 

down the window and looking at them. The door and the window exclude the 

approaching citizen; they are a barrier. Some officers take advantage of 

this barrier, perhaps unconsciously, by acting differently if in the car 

than they would on foot. We have seen this countless times. The police car 

pulls up to a corner where teenagers are gathered. The window is rolled 

down. The officer stares at the youths. They stare back. The officer says 

to one, "C'mere." He saunters over, conveying to his friends by his 

elaborately casual style the idea that he is not intimidated by authority. 

What's your name?" "Chuck." "Chuck who?" "Chuck Jones." "What'ya doing, 

Chuck?" "Nothin'." "Got a P.O. [parole officer]?" "Nah." "Sure?" "Yeah." 

"Stay out of trouble, Chuckie." Meanwhile, the other boys laugh and 

exchange comments among themselves, probably at the officer's expense. The 

officer stares harder. He cannot be certain what is being said, nor can he 

join in and, by displaying his own skill at street banter, prove that he 

cannot be "put down." In the process, the officer has learned almost 

nothing, and the boys have decided the officer is an alien force who can 

safely be disregarded, even mocked.<P>

Our experience is that most citizens like to talk to a police officer. 

Such exchanges give them a sense of importance, provide them with the 

basis for gossip, and allow them to explain to the authorities what is 

worrying them (whereby they gain a modest but significant sense of having 

"done something" about the problem). You approach a person on foot more 

easily, and talk to him more readily, than you do a person in a car. 

Moreover, you can more easily retain some anonymity if you draw an officer 

aside for a private chat. Suppose you want to pass on a tip about who is 

stealing handbags, or who offered to sell you a stolen TV. In the inner 

city, the culprit, in all likelihood, lives nearby. To walk up to a marked 

patrol car and lean in the window is to convey a visible signal that you 

are a "fink."<P>

The essence of the police role in maintaining order is to reinforce the 

informal control mechanisms of the community itself. The police cannot, 

without committing extraordinary resources, provide a substitute for that 

informal control. On the other hand, to reinforce those natural forces the 

police must accommodate them. And therein lies the problem.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>S</font>hould police activity on the street be shaped, in important ways, by the 

standards of the neighborhood rather than by the rules of the state? Over 

the past two decades, the shift of police from order-maintenance to law

enforcement has brought them increasingly under the influence of legal 

restrictions, provoked by media complaints and enforced by court decisions 

and departmental orders. As a consequence, the order

maintenance functions of the police are now governed by rules developed to 

control police relations with suspected criminals. This is, we think, an 

entirely new development. For centuries, the role of the police as 

watchmen was judged primarily not in terms of its compliance with 

appropriate procedures but rather in terms of its attaining a desired 

objective. The objective was order, an inherently ambiguous term but a 

condition that people in a given community recognized when they saw it. 

The means were the same as those the community itself would employ, if its 

members were sufficiently determined, courageous, and authoritative. 

Detecting and apprehending criminals, by contrast, was a means to an end, 

not an end in itself; a judicial determination of guilt or innocence was 

the hoped-for result of the law-enforcement mode. From the first, the 

police were expected to follow rules defining that process, though states 

differed in how stringent the rules should be. The criminal-apprehension 

process was always understood to involve individual rights, the violation 

of which was unacceptable because it meant that the violating officer 

would be acting as a judge and jury--and that was not his job. Guilt or 

innocence was to be determined by universal standards under special 

procedures.<P>

Ordinarily, no judge or jury ever sees the persons caught up in a dispute 

over the appropriate level of neighborhood order. That is true not only 

because most cases are handled informally on the street but also because 

no universal standards are available to settle arguments over disorder, 

and thus a judge may not be any wiser or more effective than a police 

officer. Until quite recently in many states, and even today in some 

places, the police made arrests on such charges as "suspicious person" or 

"vagrancy" or "public drunkenness"--charges with scarcely any legal 

meaning. These charges exist not because society wants judges to punish 

vagrants or drunks but because it wants an officer to have the legal tools 

to remove undesirable persons from a neighborhood when informal efforts to 

preserve order in the streets have failed.<P>

Once we begin to think of all aspects of police work as involving the 

application of universal rules under special procedures, we inevitably ask 

what constitutes an "undesirable person" and why we should "criminalize" 

vagrancy or drunkenness. A strong and commendable desire to see that 

people are treated fairly makes us worry about allowing the police to rout 

persons who are undesirable by some vague or parochial standard. A growing 

and not-so-commendable utilitarianism leads us to doubt that any behavior 

that does not "hurt" another person should be made illegal. And thus many 

of us who watch over the police are reluctant to allow them to perform, in 

the only way they can, a function that every neighborhood desperately 

wants them to perform.<P>

This wish to "decriminalize" disreputable behavior that "harms no one"-

and thus remove the ultimate sanction the police can employ to maintain 

neighborhood order--is, we think, a mistake. Arresting a single drunk or a 

single vagrant who has harmed no identifiable person seems unjust, and in 

a sense it is. But failing to do anything about a score of drunks or a 

hundred vagrants may destroy an entire community. A particular rule that 

seems to make sense in the individual case makes no sense when it is made 

a universal rule and applied to all cases. It makes no sense because it 

fails to take into account the connection between one broken window left 

untended and a thousand broken windows. Of course, agencies other than the 

police could attend to the problems posed by drunks or the mentally ill, 

but in most communities especially where the "deinstitutionalization" 

movement has been strong--they do not.<P>

The concern about equity is more serious. We might agree that certain 

behavior makes one person more undesirable than another but how do we 

ensure that age or skin color or national origin or harmless mannerisms 

will not also become the basis for distinguishing the undesirable from the 

desirable? How do we ensure, in short, that the police do not become the 

agents of neighborhood bigotry?<P>

We can offer no wholly satisfactory answer to this important question. We 

are not confident that there is a satisfactory answer except to hope that 

by their selection, training, and supervision, the police will be 

inculcated with a clear sense of the outer limit of their discretionary 

authority. That limit, roughly, is this--the police exist to help regulate 

behavior, not to maintain the racial or ethnic purity of a neighborhood.<P>

Consider the case of the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago, one of the 

largest public-housing projects in the country. It is home for nearly 

20,000 people, all black, and extends over ninety-two acres along South 

State Street. It was named after a distinguished black who had been, 

during the 1940s, chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority. Not long 

after it opened, in 1962, relations between project residents and the 

police deteriorated badly. The citizens felt that the police were 

insensitive or brutal; the police, in turn, complained of unprovoked 

attacks on them. Some Chicago officers tell of times when they were afraid 

to enter the Homes. Crime rates soared.<P>

Today, the atmosphere has changed. Police-citizen relations have 

improved--apparently, both sides learned something from the earlier 

experience. Recently, a boy stole a purse and ran off. Several young 

persons who saw the theft voluntarily passed along to the police 

information on the identity and residence of the thief, and they did this 

publicly, with friends and neighbors looking on. But problems persist, 

chief among them the presence of youth gangs that terrorize residents and 

recruit members in the project. The people expect the police to "do 

something" about this, and the police are determined to do just that.<P>

But do what? Though the police can obviously make arrests whenever a gang 

member breaks the law, a gang can form, recruit, and congregate without 

breaking the law. And only a tiny fraction of gang-related crimes can be 

solved by an arrest; thus, if an arrest is the only recourse for the 

police, the residents' fears will go unassuaged. The police will soon feel 

helpless, and the residents will again believe that the police "do 

nothing." What the police in fact do is to chase known gang members out of 

the project. In the words of one officer, "We kick ass." Project residents 

both know and approve of this. The tacit police-citizen alliance in the 

project is reinforced by the police view that the cops and the gangs are 

the two rival sources of power in the area, and that the gangs are not 

going to win.<P>

None of this is easily reconciled with any conception of due process or 

fair treatment. Since both residents and gang members are black, race is 

not a factor. But it could be. Suppose a white project confronted a black 

gang, or vice versa. We would be apprehensive about the police taking 

sides. But the substantive problem remains the same: how can the police 

strengthen the informal social-control mechanisms of natural communities 

in order to minimize fear in public places? Law enforcement, per se, is no 

answer: a gang can weaken or destroy a community by standing about in a 

menacing fashion and speaking rudely to passersby without breaking the 

law.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>W</font>e have difficulty thinking about such matters, not 

simply because the ethical and legal issues are so complex but because we 

have become accustomed to thinking of the law in essentially 

individualistic terms.  The law defines <I>my</I> rights, punishes 

<I>his</I> behavior and is applied by <I>that</I> officer because of <I>this</I> harm.  

We assume, in thinking this way, that what is good for the individual will 

be good for the community and what doesn't matter when it happens to one 

person won't matter if it happens to many.  Ordinarily, those are plausible 

assumptions.  But in cases where behavior that is tolerable to one person 

is intolerable to many others, the reactions of the others--fear, 

withdrawal, flight--may ultimately make matters worse for everyone, 

including the individual who first professed his indifference.<P>



It may be their greater sensitivity to communal as opposed to individual 

needs that helps explain why the residents of small communities are more 

satisfied with their police than are the residents of similar 

neighborhoods in big cities. Elinor Ostrom and her co-workers at Indiana 

University compared the perception of police services in two poor, 

all-black Illinois towns--Phoenix and East Chicago Heights with those of 

three comparable all-black neighborhoods in Chicago. The level of criminal 

victimization and the quality of police-community relations appeared to be 

about the same in the towns and the Chicago neighborhoods. But the 

citizens living in their own villages were much more likely than those 

living in the Chicago neighborhoods to say that they do not stay at home 

for fear of crime, to agree that the local police have "the right to take 

any action necessary" to deal with problems, and to agree that the police 

"look out for the needs of the average citizen." It is possible that the 

residents and the police of the small towns saw themselves as engaged in a 

collaborative effort to maintain a certain standard of communal life, 

whereas those of the big city felt themselves to be simply requesting and 

supplying particular services on an individual basis.<P>

If this is true, how should a wise police chief deploy his meager forces? 

The first answer is that nobody knows for certain, and the most prudent 

course of action would be to try further variations on the Newark 

experiment, to see more precisely what works in what kinds of 

neighborhoods. The second answer is also a hedge--many aspects of order 

maintenance in neighborhoods can probably best be handled in ways that 

involve the police minimally if at all. A busy bustling shopping center 

and a quiet, well-tended suburb may need almost no visible police 

presence. In both cases, the ratio of respectable to disreputable people 

is ordinarily so high as to make informal social control effective.<P>

Even in areas that are in jeopardy from disorderly elements, citizen 

action without substantial police involvement may be sufficient. Meetings 

between teenagers who like to hang out on a particular corner and adults 

who want to use that corner might well lead to an amicable agreement on a 

set of rules about how many people can be allowed to congregate, where, 

and when.<P>

Where no understanding is possible--or if possible, not observed--citizen 

patrols may be a sufficient response. There are two traditions of communal 

involvement in maintaining order: One, that of the "community watchmen," 

is as old as the first settlement of the New World. Until well into the 

nineteenth century, volunteer watchmen, not policemen, patrolled their 

communities to keep order. They did so, by and large, without taking the 

law into their own hands--without, that is, punishing persons or using 

force. Their presence deterred disorder or alerted the community to 

disorder that could not be deterred. There are hundreds of such efforts 

today in communities all across the nation. Perhaps the best known is that 

of the Guardian Angels, a group of unarmed young persons in distinctive 

berets and T-shirts, who first came to public attention when they began 

patrolling the New York City subways but who claim now to have chapters in 

more than thirty American cities. Unfortunately, we have little 

information about the effect of these groups on crime. It is possible, 

however, that whatever their effect on crime, citizens find their presence 

reassuring, and that they thus contribute to maintaining a sense of order 

and civility.<P>

The second tradition is that of the "vigilante." Rarely a feature of the 

settled communities of the East, it was primarily to be found in those 

frontier towns that grew up in advance of the reach of government. More 

than 350 vigilante groups are known to have existed; their distinctive 

feature was that their members did take the law into their own hands, by 

acting as judge, jury, and often executioner as well as policeman. Today, 

the vigilante movement is conspicuous by its rarity, despite the great 

fear expressed by citizens that the older cities are becoming "urban 

frontiers." But some community-watchmen groups have skirted the line, and 

others may cross it in the future. An ambiguous case, reported in The Wall 

Street Journal involved a citizens' patrol in the Silver Lake area of 

Belleville, New Jersey. A leader told the reporter, "We look for 

outsiders." If a few teenagers from outside the neighborhood enter it, "we 

ask them their business," he said. "If they say they're going down the 

street to see Mrs. Jones, fine, we let them pass. But then we follow them 

down the block to make sure they're really going to see Mrs. Jones."<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>T</font>hough citizens can do a great deal, the police are plainly the key to 

order maintenance. For one thing, many communities, such as the Robert 

Taylor Homes, cannot do the job by themselves. For another, no citizen in 

a neighborhood, even an organized one, is likely to feel the sense of 

responsibility that wearing a badge confers. Psychologists have done many 

studies on why people fail to go to the aid of persons being attacked or 

seeking help, and they have learned that the cause is not "apathy" or 

"selfishness" but the absence of some plausible grounds for feeling that 

one must personally accept responsibility. Ironically, avoiding 

responsibility is easier when a lot of people are standing about. On 

streets and in public places, where order is so important, many people are 

likely to be "around," a fact that reduces the chance of any one person 

acting as the agent of the community. The police officer's uniform singles 

him out as a person who must accept responsibility if asked. In addition, 

officers, more easily than their fellow citizens, can be expected to 

distinguish between what is necessary to protect the safety of the street 

and what merely protects its ethnic purity.<P>

But the police forces of America are losing, not gaining, members. Some 

cities have suffered substantial cuts in the number of officers available 

for duty. These cuts are not likely to be reversed in the near future. 

Therefore, each department must assign its existing officers with great 

care. Some neighborhoods are so demoralized and crime-ridden as to make 

foot patrol useless; the best the police can do with limited resources is 

respond to the enormous number of calls for service. Other neighborhoods 

are so stable and serene as to make foot patrol unnecessary. The key is to 

identify neighborhoods at the tipping point--where the public order is 

deteriorating but not unreclaimable, where the streets are used frequently 

but by apprehensive people, where a window is likely to be broken at any 

time, and must quickly be fixed if all are not to be shattered.<P>

Most police departments do not have ways of systematically identifying 

such areas and assigning officers to them. Officers are assigned on the 

basis of crime rates (meaning that marginally threatened areas are often 

stripped so that police can investigate crimes in areas where the 

situation is hopeless) or on the basis of calls for service (despite the 

fact that most citizens do not call the police when they are merely 

frightened or annoyed). To allocate patrol wisely, the department must 

look at the neighborhoods and decide, from first-hand evidence, where an 

additional officer will make the greatest difference in promoting a sense 

of safety.<P>

One way to stretch limited police resources is being tried in some public

housing projects. Tenant organizations hire off-duty police officers for 

patrol work in their buildings. The costs are not high (at least not per 

resident), the officer likes the additional income, and the residents feel 

safer. Such arrangements are probably more successful than hiring private 

watchmen, and the Newark experiment helps us understand why. A private 

security guard may deter crime or misconduct by his presence, and he may 

go to the aid of persons needing help, but he may well not intervene--that 

is, control or drive away--someone challenging community standards. Being 

a sworn officer--a "real cop"--seems to give one the confidence, the sense 

of duty, and the aura of authority necessary to perform this difficult 

task.<P>

Patrol officers might be encouraged to go to and from duty stations on 

public transportation and, while on the bus or subway car, enforce rules 

about smoking, drinking, disorderly conduct, and the like. The enforcement 

need involve nothing more than ejecting the offender (the offense, after 

all, is not one with which a booking officer or a judge wishes to be 

bothered). Perhaps the random but relentless maintenance of standards on 

buses would lead to conditions on buses that approximate the level of 

civility we now take for granted on airplanes.<P>

But the most important requirement is to think that to maintain order in 

precarious situations is a vital job. The police know this is one of their 

functions, and they also believe, correctly, that it cannot be done to the 

exclusion of criminal investigation and responding to calls. We may have 

encouraged them to suppose, however, on the basis of our oft-repeated 

concerns about serious, violent crime, that they will be judged 

exclusively on their capacity as crime-fighters. To the extent that this 

is the case, police administrators will continue to concentrate police 

personnel in the highest-crime areas (though not necessarily in the areas 

most vulnerable to criminal invasion), emphasize their training in the law 

and criminal apprehension (and not their training in managing street 

life), and join too quickly in campaigns to decriminalize "harmless" 

behavior (though public drunkenness, street prostitution, and pornographic 

displays can destroy a community more quickly than any team of 

professional burglars).<P>

Above all, we must return to our long-abandoned view that the police ought 

to protect communities as well as individuals. Our crime statistics and 

victimization surveys measure individual losses, but they do not measure 

communal losses. Just as physicians now recognize the importance of 

fostering health rather than simply treating illness, so the police--and 

the rest of us--ought to recognize the importance of maintaining, intact, 

communities without broken windows. <P>

<blockquote>

	

	<font size=5>N</font>EW Briarfield Apartments is an old, run-down collection of wooden 

buildings constructed in 1942 as temporary housing for shipyard workers in 

Newport News, Virginia. By the mid-1980s it was widely regarded as the 

worst housing project in the city. Many of its vacant units provided 

hiding places for drug users. It had the highest burglary rate in Newport 

News; nearly a quarter of its apartments were broken into at least once a 

year.<P>

For decades the police had wearily answered calls for assistance and had 

investigated crimes in New Briarfield. Not much came of this police 

attentiveness--the buildings went on deteriorating, the burglaries went on 

occurring, the residents went on living in terror. Then, in 1984, 

Detective Tony Duke, assigned to a newly created police task force, 

decided to interview the residents of New Briarfield about their problems. 

Not surprisingly, he found that they were worried about the burglaries-

but they were just as concerned about the physical deterioration of the 

project. Rather than investigating only the burglaries, Duke spent some of 

his time investigating the buildings. Soon he learned that many city 

agencies--the fire department, the public-works department, the housing 

department--regarded New Briarfield as a major headache. He also 

discovered that its owners were in default on a federal loan and that 

foreclosure was imminent.<P>

The report he wrote to Darrel Stephens, then the police chief, led 

Stephens to recommend to the city manager that New Briarfield be 

demolished and its tenants relocated. The city manager agreed. Meanwhile, 

Barry Haddix, the patrol officer assigned to the area, began working with 

members of other city agencies to fix up the project, pending its eventual 

replacement. Trash was carted away, abandoned cars were removed, potholes 

were filled in, the streets were swept. According to a study recently done 

by John E. Eck and William Spelman, of the Police Executive Research Forum 

(PERF), the burglary rate dropped by 35 percent after Duke and Haddix 

began their work.<P>

Stephens, now the executive director of PERF tells the story of the New 

Briarfield project as an example of "problem-oriented policing," a concept 

developed by Professor Herman Goldstein, of the University of Wisconsin 

Law School, and sometimes also called community-oriented policing. The 

conventional police strategy is "incident-oriented"--a citizen calls to 

report an incident, such as a burglary, and the police respond by 

recording information relevant to the crime and then trying to solve it. 

Obviously, when a crime occurs, the victim is entitled to a rapid, 

effective police response. But if responding to incidents is all that the 

police do, the community problems that cause or explain many of these 

incidents will never be addressed, and so the incidents will continue and 

their number will perhaps increase.<P>

This will happen for two reasons. One is that a lot of serious crime is 

adventitious, not the result of inexorable social forces or personal 

failings. A rash of burglaries may occur because drug users have found a 

back alley or an abandoned building in which to hang out. In their spare 

time, and in order to get money to buy drugs, they steal from their 

neighbors. If the back alleys are cleaned up and the abandoned buildings 

torn down, the drug users will go away. They may even use fewer drugs, 

because they will have difficulty finding convenient dealers and soft 

burglary targets. By the same token, a neglected neighborhood may become 

the turf of a youth gang, whose members commit more crimes together in a 

group than they would if they were acting alone. If the gang is broken up, 

former members will still commit some crimes but probably not as many as 

before.<P>

Most crime in most neighborhoods is local: the offenders live near their 

victims. Because of this, one should not assume that changing the 

environmental conditions conducive to crime in one area will displace the 

crime to other areas. For example, when the New York City police 

commissioner, Ben Ward, ordered Operation Pressure Point, a crackdown on 

drug dealing on the Lower East Side, dealing and the criminality 

associated with it were reduced in that neighborhood and apparently did 

not immediately reappear in other, contiguous neighborhoods. Suburban 

customers of the local drug dealers were frightened away by the sight of 

dozens of police officers on the streets where these customers had once 

shopped openly for drugs. They could not--at least not right away--find 

another neighborhood in which to buy drugs as easily as they once had on 

the Lower East Side. At the same time, the local population included some 

people who were willing to aid and abet the drug dealers. When the police 

presence made drug dealing unattractive, the dealers could not--again, at 

least not for the time being--find another neighborhood that provided an 

equivalent social infrastructure.<P>

The second reason that incident-oriented police work fails to discourage 

neighborhood crime is that law-abiding citizens who are afraid to go out 

onto streets filled with graffiti, winos, and loitering youths yield 

control of these streets to people who are not frightened by these signs 

of urban decay. Those not frightened turn out to be the same people who 

created the problem in the first place. Law-abiding citizens, already 

fearful, see things occurring that make them even more fearful. A vicious 

cycle begins of fear-induced behavior increasing the sources of that 

fear.<P>

A Los Angeles police sergeant put it this way: "When people in this 

district see that a gang has spray-painted its initials on all the stop 

signs, they decide that the gang, not the people or the police, controls 

the streets. When they discover that the Department of Transportation 

needs three months to replace the stop signs, they decide that the city 

isn't as powerful as the gang. These people want us to help them take back 

the streets." Painting gang symbols on a stop sign or a storefront is not, 

by itself, a serious crime. As an incident, it is trivial. But as the 

symptom of a problem, it is very serious.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>I</font>N an earlier article in The Atlantic (March, 1982) we called this the 

problem of "broken windows": If the first broken window in a building is 

not repaired, then people who like breaking windows will assume that no 

one cares about the building and more windows will be broken. Soon the 

building will have no windows. Likewise, when disorderly behavior--say, 

rude remarks by loitering youths--is left unchallenged, the signal given 

is that no one cares. The disorder escalates, possibly to serious crime.<P>

The sort of police work practiced in Newport News is an effort to fix the 

broken windows. Similar projects are under way in cities all over America. 

This pattern constitutes the beginnings of the most significant 

redefinition of police work in the past half century. For example:<P>



- When a gunfight occurred at Garden Village, a low-income housing 

project near Baltimore, the Baltimore County police responded by 

investigating both the shooting and the housing project. Chief Cornelius 

Behan directed the officers in his Community Oriented Police Enforcement 

(COPE) unit to find out what could be done to alleviate the fears of the 

project residents and the gang tensions that led to the shooting. COPE 

officers worked with members of other agencies to upgrade street lighting 

in the area, trim shrubbery, install door locks, repair the roads and 

alleys, and get money to build a playground. With police guidance, the 

tenants organized. At the same time, high-visibility patrols were started 

and gang members were questioned. When both a suspect in the shooting and 

a particularly troublesome parole violator were arrested, gang tensions 

eased. Crime rates dropped. In bringing about this change, the police 

dealt with eleven different public agencies.<P>



- When local merchants in a New York City neighborhood complained to the 

police about homeless persons who created a mess on the streets and whose 

presence frightened away customers, the officer who responded did not 

roust the vagrants but instead suggested that the merchants hire them to 

clean the streets in front of their stores every morning. The merchants 

agreed, and now the streets are clean all day and the customers find the 

stores more attractive.<P>



-  When people in a Los Angeles neighborhood complained to the police 

about graffiti on walls and gang symbols on stop signs, officers assigned 

to the Community Mobilization Project in the Wilshire station did more 

than just try to catch the gang youths who were wielding the spray cans; 

they also organized citizens' groups and Boy Scouts to paint over the 

graffiti as fast as they were put up.<P>



-  When residents of a Houston neighborhood became fearful about crime in 

their area, the police not only redoubled their efforts to solve the 

burglaries and thefts but also assigned some officers to talk with the 

citizens in their homes. During a nine-month period the officers visited 

more than a third of all the dwelling units in the area, introduced 

themselves, asked about any neighborhood problems, and left their business 

cards. When Antony Pate and Mary Ann Wycoff, researchers at the Police 

Foundation, evaluated the project, they found that the people in this 

area, unlike others living in a similar area where no citizen-contact 

project occurred, felt that social disorder had decreased and that the 

neighborhood had become a better place to live. Moreover, and quite 

unexpectedly, the amount of property crime was noticeably reduced.<P>



These are all examples of community-oriented policing, whose current 

popularity among police chiefs is as great as the ambiguity of the idea. 

In a sense, the police have always been community-oriented. Every police 

officer knows that most crimes don't get solved if victims and witnesses 

do not cooperate. One way to encourage that cooperation is to cultivate 

the good will of both victims and witnesses. Similarly, police-citizen 

tensions, over racial incidents or allegations of brutality or hostility, 

can often be allayed, and sometimes prevented, if police officers stay in 

close touch with community groups. Accordingly, most departments have at 

least one community-relations officer, who arranges meetings between 

officers and citizens' groups in church basements and other neutral 

locales.<P>

But these commonplace features of police work are add-ons, and rarely 

alter the traditional work of most patrol officers and detectives: 

responding to radio calls about specific incidents. The focus on incidents 

works against a focus on problems. If Detective Tony Duke had focused only 

on incidents in New Briarfield, he would still be investigating burglaries 

in that housing project; meanwhile, the community-relations officer would 

be telling outraged residents that the police were doing all they could 

and urging people to call in any useful leads. If a tenant at one of those 

meetings had complained about stopped-up drains, rotting floorboards, and 

abandoned refrigerators, the community-relations officer would have 

patiently explained that these were not "police matters."<P>

And of course, they are not. They are the responsibility of the landlord, 

the tenants themselves, and city agencies other than the police. But 

landlords are sometimes indifferent, tenants rarely have the resources to 

make needed repairs, and other city agencies do not have a 

twenty-four-hour emergency service. Like it or not, the police are about 

the only city agency that makes house calls around the clock. And like it 

or not, the public defines broadly what it thinks of as public order, and 

holds the police responsible for maintaining order.<P>

Community-oriented policing means changing the daily work of the police to 

include investigating problems as well as incidents. It means defining as 

a problem whatever a significant body of public opinion regards as a 

threat to community order. It means working with the good guys, and not 

just against the bad guys.<P>

The link between incidents and problems can sometimes be measured. The 

police know from experience what research by Glenn Pierce, in Boston, and 

Lawrence Sherman, in Minneapolis, has established: fewer than 10 percent 

of the addresses from which the police receive calls account for more than 

60 percent of those calls. Many of the calls involve domestic disputes. If 

each call is treated as a separate incident with neither a history nor a 

future, then each dispute will be handled by police officers anxious to 

pacify the complainants and get back on patrol as quickly as possible. All 

too often, however, the disputants move beyond shouting insults or 

throwing crockery at each other. A knife or a gun may be produced, and 

somebody may die.<P>

A very large proportion of all killings occur in these domestic settings. 

A study of domestic homicides in Kansas City showed that in eight out of 

ten cases the police had been called to the incident address at least once 

before; in half the cases they had been called five times or more. The 

police are familiar with this pattern, and they have learned how best to 

respond to it. An experiment in Minneapolis, conducted by the Police 

Foundation, showed that men who were arrested after assaulting their 

spouses were much less likely to commit new assaults than those who were 

merely pacified or asked to leave the house for a few hours. Research is 

now under way in other cities to test this finding. Arrest may prove 

always to be the best disposition, or we may learn that some kind of 

intervention by a social agency also helps. What is indisputable is that a 

domestic fight--like many other events to which the police respond--is 

less an "incident" than a problem likely to have serious, long-term 

consequences.<P>

Another such problem, familiar to New Yorkers, is graffiti on subway cars. 

What to some aesthetes is folk art is to most people a sign that an 

important public place is no longer under public control. If graffiti 

painters can attack cars with impunity then muggers may feel they can 

attack the people in those cars with equal impunity. When we first wrote 

in these pages about the problem of broken windows, we dwelt on the 

graffiti problem as an example of a minor crime creating a major crisis.<P>

The police seemed powerless to do much about it. They could arrest youths 

with cans of spray paint, but for every one arrested ten more went 

undetected, and of those arrested, few were punished. The New York Transit 

Authority, led by its chairman, Robert Kiley, and its president, David 

Gunn, decided that graffiti-free cars were a major management goal. New, 

easier-to-clean cars were bought. More important, key people in the 

Authority were held accountable for cleaning the cars and keeping them 

clean. Whereas in the early 1980s two out of every three cars were covered 

with graffiti, today fewer than one in six is. The Transit Police have 

played their part by arresting those who paint the cars, but they have 

been more successful at keeping cars from being defaced in the first place 

than they were at chasing people who were spraying already defaced ones.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>W</font>HILE the phrase "community-oriented policing" comes easily to the lips of 

police administrators, redefining the police mission is more difficult. To 

help the police become accustomed to fixing broken windows as well as 

arresting window-breakers requires doing things that are very hard for 

many administrators to do.<P>

Authority over at least some patrol officers must be decentralized, so 

that they have a good deal of freedom to manage their time (including 

their paid overtime). This implies freeing them at least partly from the 

tyranny of the radio call. It means giving them a broad range of 

responsibilities: to find and understand the problems that create disorder 

and crime, and to deal with other public and private agencies that can 

help cope with these problems, It means assigning them to a neighborhood 

and leaving them there for an extended period of time. It means backing 

them up with department support and resources.<P>

The reason these are not easy things for police chiefs to do is not simply 

that chiefs are slaves to tradition, though some impatient advocates of 

community-oriented policing like to say so. Consider for a moment how all 

these changes might sound to an experienced and intelligent police 

executive who must defend his department against media criticisms of 

officer misconduct, political pressure to cut budgets, and interest-group 

demands for more police protection everywhere. With decentralized 

authority no one will know precisely how patrol officers spend their time. 

Moreover, decentralized authority means that patrol officers will spend 

time on things like schmoozing with citizens, instead of on quantifiable 

tasks like issuing tickets, making arrests, and clearing cases.<P>

Making the community-oriented officers generalists means letting them deal 

with other city agencies, a responsibility for which few officers are well 

trained and which cuts across sensitive questions of turf and public 

expectations.<P>

If officers are left in a neighborhood, some of them may start taking 

money from the dope dealers and after-hours joints. To prevent that, 

officers are frequently moved around. Moreover, the best people are 

usually kept in the detective squad that handles the really big cases. Few 

police executives want their best people settling into a neighborhood, 

walking around the bus stops and shopping malls.<P>

The enthusiasts for community-oriented policing have answers for all these 

concerns, but sometimes in their zeal they forget that they are contending 

with more than mere bureaucratic foot-dragging--that the problems are real 

and require thoughtful solutions. Many police executives get in trouble 

not because the crime rate goes up but because cops are accused of graft, 

brutality, laziness, incivility, or indifference.<P>

In short, police management is driven more by the constraints on the job 

than by the goals of the job. You cannot cope with those constraints 

without understanding them. This may be why some of the biggest changes 

toward community-oriented policing have occurred in cities where a new 

chief has come in from the outside with a mandate to shake up a moribund 

department. Lee Brown brought a community orientation to the Houston 

Police Department under precisely those circumstances--the reputation of 

the department was so bad that almost any change would have been regarded 

as an improvement.<P>

What can we say to the worried police chief who is already running a 

pretty good department? Start with corruption: For decades police 

executives and reformers have believed that in order to prevent 

corruption, you have to centralize control over personnel and discourage 

intimacy between police officers and citizens. Maybe. But the price one 

pays for this is very high. For example, many neighborhoods are being 

destroyed by drug dealers, who hang out on every street corner. The best 

way to sweep them off the streets is to have patrol officers arrest them 

for selling drugs and intimidate their customers by parking police cars 

right next to suspected drug outlets. But some police chiefs forbid their 

patrol officers to work drug cases, for fear they will be corrupted. When 

the citizens in these cities see police cars drive past scenes of open 

drug dealing, they assume the police have been paid off. Efforts to 

prevent corruption have produced the appearance of corruption.<P>

Police Commissioner Ben Ward, in New York, decided that the price of this 

kind of anti-corruption strategy was too high. His Operation Pressure 

Point put scores of police officers on the streets to break up the drug

dealing bazaar. Police corruption is no laughing matter, especially in New 

York, but some chiefs now believe that it will have to be fought in ways 

that do not require police officers to avoid contact with people.<P>

Consider the problem of getting police resources and managing political 

pressures: resources can be justified with statistics, but statistics 

often become ends in themselves. One police captain we interviewed said 

that his department was preoccupied with "stacking widgets and counting 

beans." He asked his superior for permission to take officers out of radio 

cars and have them work on community problems. The superior agreed but 

warned that he would be watching to see what happened to "the stats." In 

the short run the stats--for example, calls answered, average response 

time--were likely to get worse, but if community problems were solved, 

they would get better as citizens had fewer incidents to report. The 

captain worried, however, that he would not be given enough time to 

achieve this and that the bean counters would cut off his program.<P>

A better way to justify getting resources from the city is to stimulate 

popular demand for resources devoted to problem-solving. Properly handled, 

community-oriented policing does generate support for the department. When 

Newark police officers, under orders from Hubert Williams, then the police 

director, began stopping city buses and boarding them to enforce city 

ordinances against smoking, drinking, gambling, and playing loud music, 

the bus patrons often applauded. When Los Angeles police officers 

supervised the hauling away of abandoned cars, onlookers applauded. Later, 

when some of the officers had their time available for problem-solving 

work cut back, several hundred citizens attended a meeting to complain.<P>

In Flint, Michigan, patrol officers were taken out of their cars and 

assigned to foot beats. Robert Trojanowicz, a professor at Michigan State 

University, analyzed the results and found big increases in citizen 

satisfaction and officer morale, and even a significant drop in crime (an 

earlier foot-patrol project in Newark had produced equivalent reductions 

in fear but no reductions in crime). Citizen support was not confined to 

statements made to pollsters, however. Voters in referenda twice approved 

tax increases to maintain the foot-patrol system, the second time by a 

two-to-one margin. New Briarfield tenants unquestionably found 

satisfaction in the role the police played in getting temporary 

improvements made on their housing project and getting a commitment for 

its ultimate replacement. Indeed, when a department experiments with a 

community-oriented project in one precinct, people in other precincts 

usually want one too.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>P</font>OLITICIANS, like police chiefs, hear these views and respond. But they 

hear other views as well. One widespread political mandate is to keep the 

tax rate down. Many police departments are already stretched thin by sharp 

reductions in spending that occurred in the lean years of the 1970s. 

Putting one additional patrol car on the streets around the clock can cost 

a quarter of a million dollars or more a year.<P>

Change may seem easier when resources are abundant. Ben Ward could start 

Operation Pressure Point because he had at his disposal a large number of 

new officers who could be thrown into a crackdown on street

level drug dealing. Things look a bit different in Los Angeles, where no 

big increases in personnel are on the horizon. As a result, only eight 

officers are assigned to the problem-solving Community Mobilization 

Project in the Wilshire district--an economically and ethnically diverse 

area of nearly 300,000 residents.<P>

But change does not necessarily require more resources, and the 

availability of new resources is no guarantee that change will be 

attempted. One temptation is to try to sell the public on the need for 

more policemen and decide later how to use them. Usually when that script 

is followed, either the public turns down the spending increase or the 

extra personnel are dumped into what one LAPD captain calls the "black 

hole" of existing commitments, leaving no trace and producing no 

effects.<P>

What may have an effect is how the police are deployed and managed. An 

experiment jointly conducted by the Washington, D.C., Police Department 

and the Police Foundation showed that if a few experienced officers 

concentrate on known repeat offenders, the number of serious offenders 

taken off the streets grows substantially. The Flint and Newark 

experiences suggest that foot patrols in certain kinds of communities (but 

not all) can reduce fear. In Houston problem-oriented tactics seem clearly 

to have heightened a sense of citizen security.<P>

The problem of interagency cooperation may, in the long run, be the most 

difficult of all. The police can bring problems to the attention of other 

city agencies, but the system is not always organized to respond. In his 

book Neighborhood Services, John Mudd calls it the "rat problem": "If a 

rat is found in an apartment, it is a housing inspection responsibility; 

if it runs into a restaurant, the health department has jurisdiction; if 

it goes outside and dies in an alley, public works takes over." A police 

officer who takes public complaints about rats seriously will go crazy 

trying to figure out what agency in the city has responsibility for rat 

control and then inducing it to kill the rats.<P>

Matters are almost as bad if the public is complaining about abandoned 

houses or school-age children who are not in school. The housing 

department may prefer to concentrate on enforcing the housing code rather 

than go through the costly and time-consuming process of getting an 

abandoned house torn down. The school department may have expelled the 

truant children for making life miserable for the teachers and the other 

students; the last thing it wants is for the police to tell the school to 

take the kids back.<P>

All city and county agencies have their own priorities and face their own 

pressures. Forcing them to cooperate by knocking heads together at the top 

rarely works; what department heads promise the mayor they will do may 

bear little relationship to what their rank-and-file employees actually 

do. From his experiences in New York City government Mudd discovered that 

if you want agencies to cooperate in solving neighborhood problems, you 

have to get the neighborhood-level supervisors from each agency together 

in a "district cabinet" that meets regularly and addresses common 

concerns. This is not an easy task (for one thing, police district lines 

often do not match the district boundaries of the school, housing, 

traffic, and public

works departments), but where it has been tried it has made solving the 

"rat problem" a lot easier. For example, Mudd reports, such interagency 

issues as park safety and refuse-laden vacant lots got handled more 

effectively when the field supervisors met to talk about them than when 

memos went up the chain of command of one agency and then down the chain 

of command of another.<P>

<BR>

<BR>



<font size=5>C</font>OMMUNITY organizations along the lines of Neighborhood Watch programs may 

help reduce crime, but we cannot be certain. In particular, we do not know 

what kinds of communities are most likely to benefit from such programs. A 

Police Foundation study in Minneapolis found that getting effective 

community organizations started in the most troubled neighborhoods was 

very difficult. The costs and benefits of having patrol officers and 

sergeants influence the delivery of services from other city agencies has 

never been fully assessed. No way of wresting control of a neighborhood 

from a street gang has yet been proved effective.<P>

And even if these questions are answered, a police department may still 

have difficulty accommodating two very different working cultures: the 

patrol officers and detectives who handle major crimes (murders, rapes, 

and robberies) and the cops who work on community problems and the 

seemingly minor incidents they generate. In every department we visited, 

some of the incident-oriented officers spoke disparagingly of the 

problem-oriented officers as "social workers," and some of the latter 

responded by calling the former "ghetto blasters." If a community-service 

officer seems to get too close to the community, he or she may be accused 

of "going native." The tension between the two cultures is heightened by 

the fact that in many departments becoming a detective is regarded as a 

major promotion, and detectives are often selected from among those 

officers who have the best record in making major arrests--in other words, 

from the ranks of the incident-oriented. But this pattern need not be 

permanent. Promotion tracks can be changed so that a patrol officer, 

especially one working on community problems, is no longer regarded as 

somebody who "hasn't made detective." Moreover, some police executives now 

believe that splitting the patrol force into two units--one oriented to 

incidents, the other to problems--is unwise. They are searching for ways 

to give all patrol officers the time and resources for problem-solving 

activities.<P>

Because of the gaps in our knowledge about both the results and the 

difficulties of community-oriented policing, no chief should be urged to 

accept, uncritically, the community-oriented model. But the traditional 

model of police professionalism--devoting resources to quick radio-car 

response to calls about specific crime incidents--makes little sense at a 

time when the principal threats to public order and safety come from 

collective, not individual, sources, and from problems, not incidents: 

from well-organized gangs and drug traffickers, from uncared-for legions 

of the homeless, from boisterous teenagers taking advantage of their 

newfound freedom and affluence in congested urban settings.<P>

Even if community-oriented policing does not produce the dramatic gains 

that some of its more ardent advocates expect, it has indisputably 

produced one that the officers who have been involved in it immediately 

acknowledge: it has changed their perceptions of the community. Officer 

Robin Kirk, of the Houston Police Department, had to be talked into 

becoming part of a neighborhood fear-reduction project. Once in it, he was 

converted. In his words, "Traditionally, police officers after about three 

years get to thinking that everybody's a loser. That's the only people 

you're dealing with. In community policing you're dealing with the good 

citizens, helping them solve problems."<p>

<blockquote>
	<i><font size=4>The social-science evidence is in: though it may benefit the adults 
involved,
the dissolution of intact two-parent families is harmful to large numbers 
of children. Moreover, the author argues, family diversity in the form of 
increasing numbers of single-parent and stepparent families does not 
strengthen the social fabric but, rather, dramatically weakens and 
undermines society</i></font><p>
	


<br>
	
	<font size=5>D</font>ivorce and out-of-wedlock childbirth are transforming 
	the lives 
of American children. In the postwar generation more than 80 percent of 
children grew up in a family with two biological parents who were married 
to each other. By 1980 only 50 percent could expect to spend their entire 
childhood in an intact family. If current trends continue, less than half 
of all children born today will live continuously with their own mother 
and father throughout child hood. Most American children will spend 
several years in a single-mother family. Some will eventually live in 
stepparent families, but because stepfamilies are more likely to break up 
than intact (by which I mean two-biological-parent) families, an 
increasing number of children will experience family breakup two or even 
three times during childhood. <P>
According to a growing body of social-scientific evidence, children in 
families disrupted by divorce and out-of-wedlock birth do worse than 
children in intact families on several measures of well-being. Children in 
single-parent families are six times as likely to be poor. They are also 
likely to stay poor longer. Twenty-two percent of children in one-parent 
families will experience poverty during childhood for seven years or more, 
as compared with only two percent of children in two
parent families. A 1988 survey by the National Center for Health 
Statistics found that children in single-parent families are two to three 
times as likely as children in two-parent families to have emotional and 
behavioral problems. They are also more likely to drop out of high school, 
to get pregnant as teenagers, to abuse drugs, and to be in trouble with 
the law. Compared with children in intact families, children from 
disrupted families are at a much higher risk for physical or sexual abuse. 
<P>
Contrary to popular belief, many children do not "bounce back" after 
divorce or remarriage. Difficulties that are associated with family 
breakup often persist into adulthood. Children who grow up in 
single-parent or stepparent families are less successful as adults, 
particularly in the two domains of life--love and work--that are most 
essential to happiness. Needless to say, not all children experience such 
negative effects. However, research shows that many children from 
disrupted families have a harder time achieving intimacy in a 
relationship, forming a stable marriage, or even holding a steady job. <P>

Despite this growing body of evidence, it is nearly impossible to discuss 
changes in family structure without provoking angry protest. Many people 
see the discussion as no more than an attack on struggling single mothers 
and their children: Why blame single mothers when they are doing the very 
best they can? After all, the decision to end a marriage or a relationship 
is wrenching, and few parents are indifferent to the painful burden this 
decision imposes on their children. Many take the perilous step toward 
single parenthood as a last resort, after their best efforts to hold a 
marriage together have failed. Consequently, it can seem particularly 
cruel and unfeeling to remind parents of the hardships their children 
might suffer as a result of family breakup. Other people believe that the 
dramatic changes in family structure, though regrettable, are impossible 
to reverse. Family breakup is an inevitable feature of American life, and 
anyone who thinks otherwise is indulging in nostalgia or trying to turn 
back the clock. Since these new family forms are here to stay, the 
reasoning goes, we must accord respect to single parents, not criticize 
them. Typical is the view expressed by a Brooklyn woman in a recent letter 
to The New York Times: "Let's stop moralizing or blaming single parents 
and unwed mothers, and give them the respect they have earned and the 
support they deserve." <P>

Such views are not to be dismissed. Indeed, they help to explain why 
family structure is such an explosive issue for Americans. The debate 
about it is not simply about the social-scientific evidence, although that 
is surely an important part of the discussion. It is also a debate over 
deeply held and often conflicting values. How do we begin to reconcile our 
long-standing belief in equality and diversity with an impressive body of 
evidence that suggests that not all family structures produce equal 
outcomes for children? How can we square traditional notions of public 
support for dependent women and children with a belief in women's right to 
pursue autonomy and independence in childbearing and child-rearing? How do 
we uphold the freedom of adults to pursue individual happiness in their 
private relationships and at the same time respond to the needs of 
children for stability, security, and permanence in their family lives? 
What do we do when the interests of adults and children conflict? These 
are the difficult issues at stake in the debate over family structure. <P>

In the past these issues have turned out to be too difficult and too 
politically risky for debate. In the mid-1960s Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 
then an assistant secretary of labor, was denounced as a racist for 
calling attention to the relationship between the prevalence of black 
single-mother families and the lower socioeconomic standing of black 
children. For nearly twenty years the policy and research communities 
backed away from the entire issue. In 1980 the Carter Administration 
convened a historic White House Conference on Families, designed to 
address the growing problems of children and families in America. The 
result was a prolonged, publicly subsidized quarrel over the definition of 
"family." No President since has tried to hold a national family 
conference. Last year, at a time when the rate of out-of-wedlock births 
had reached a historic high, Vice President Dan Quayle was ridiculed for 
criticizing Murphy Brown. In short, every time the issue of family 
structure has been raised, the response has been first controversy, then 
retreat, and finally silence. <P>

Yet it is also risky to ignore the issue of changing family structure. In 
recent years the problems associated with family disruption have grown. 
Overall child well-being has declined, despite a decrease in the number of 
children per family, an increase in the educational level of parents, and 
historically high levels of public spending. After dropping in the 1960s 
and 1970s, the proportion of children in poverty has increased 
dramatically, from 15 percent in 1970 to 20 percent in 1990, while the 
percentage of adult Americans in poverty has remained roughly constant. 
The teen suicide rate has more than tripled. Juvenile crime has increased 
and become more violent. School performance has continued to decline. 
There are no signs that these trends are about to reverse themselves. <P>

If we fail to come to terms with the relationship between family structure 
and declining child well-being, then it will be increasingly difficult to 
improve children's life prospects, no matter how many new programs the 
federal government funds. Nor will we be able to make progress in 
bettering school performance or reducing crime or improving the quality of 
the nation's future work force--all domestic problems closely connected to 
family breakup. Worse, we may contribute to the problem by pursuing 
policies that actually increase family instability and breakup. <P>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>From Death to Divorce</b><P>
<BR>
Across time and across cultures, family disruption has been regarded as an 
event that threatens a child's well-being and even survival. This view is 
rooted in a fundamental biological fact: unlike the young of almost any 
other species, the human child is born in an abjectly helpless and 
immature state. Years of nurture and protection are needed before the 
child can achieve physical independence. Similarly, it takes years of 
interaction with at least one but ideally two or more adults for a child 
to develop into a socially competent adult. Children raised in virtual 
isolation from human beings, though physically intact, display few 
recognizably human behaviors. The social arrangement that has proved most 
successful in ensuring the physical survival and promoting the social 
development of the child is the family unit of the biological mother and 
father. Consequently, any event that permanently denies a child the 
presence and protection of a parent jeopardizes the life of the child. <P>

The classic form of family disruption is the death of a parent. Throughout 
history this has been one of the risks of childhood. Mothers frequently 
died in childbirth, and it was not unusual for both parents to die before 
the child was grown. As recently as the early decades of this century 
children commonly suffered the death of at least one parent. Almost a 
quarter of the children born in this country in 1900 lost one parent by 
the time they were fifteen years old. Many of these children lived with 
their widowed parent, often in a household with other close relatives. 
Others grew up in orphanages and foster homes.<P>

The meaning of parental death, as it has been transmitted over time and 
faithfully recorded in world literature and lore, is unambiguous and 
essentially unchanging. It is universally regarded as an untimely and 
tragic event. Death permanently severs the parent-child bond, disrupting 
forever one of the child's earliest and deepest human attachments. It also 
deprives a child of the presence and protection of an adult who has a 
biological stake in, as well as an emotional commitment to, the child's 
survival and well-being. In short, the death of a parent is the most 
extreme and severe loss a child can suffer.<P>

Because a child is so vulnerable in a parent's absence, there has been a 
common cultural response to the death of a parent: an outpouring of 
support from family, friends, and strangers alike. The surviving parent 
and child are united in their grief as well as their loss. Relatives and 
friends share in the loss and provide valuable emotional and financial 
assistance to the bereaved family. Other members of the community show 
sympathy for the child, and public assistance is available for those who 
need it. This cultural understanding of parental death has formed the 
basis for a tradition of public support to widows and their children. 
Indeed, as recently as the beginning of this century widows were the only 
mothers eligible for pensions in many states, and today widows with 
children receive more-generous welfare benefits from Survivors Insurance 
than do other single mothers with children who depend on Aid to Families 
With Dependent Children. <P>

It has taken thousands upon thousands of years to reduce the threat of 
parental death. Not until the middle of the twentieth century did parental 
death cease to be a commonplace event for children in the United States. 
By then advances in medicine had dramatically reduced mortality rates for 
men and women. <P>

At the same time, other forms of family disruption--separation, divorce, 
out-of
wedlock birth--were held in check by powerful religious, social, and legal 
sanctions. Divorce was widely regarded both as a deviant behavior, 
especially threatening to mothers and children, and as a personal lapse: 
"Divorce is the public acknowledgment of failure," a 1940s sociology 
textbook noted. Out-of-wedlock birth was stigmatized, and stigmatization 
is a powerful means of regulating behavior, as any smoker or overeater 
will testify. Sanctions against nonmarital childbirth discouraged behavior 
that hurt children and exacted compensatory behavior that helped them. 
Shotgun marriages and adoption, two common responses to nonmarital birth, 
carried a strong message about the risks of premarital sex and created an 
intact family for the child.<P>

Consequently, children did not have to worry much about losing a parent 
through divorce or never having had one because of nonmarital birth. After 
a surge in divorces following the Second World War, the rate leveled off. 
Only 11 percent of children born in the 1950s would by the time they 
turned eighteen see their parents separate or divorce. Out-of-wedlock 
childbirth barely figured as a cause of family disruption. In the 1950s 
and early 1960s, five percent of the nation's births were out of wedlock. 
Blacks were more likely than whites to bear children outside marriage, but 
the majority of black children born in the twenty years after the Second 
World War were born to married couples. The rate of family disruption 
reached a historic low point during those years. <P>

A new standard of family security and stability was established in postwar 
America. For the first time in history the vast majority of the nation's 
children could expect to live with married biological parents throughout 
childhood. Children might still suffer other forms of adversity --poverty, 
racial discrimination, lack of educational opportunity--but only a few 
would be deprived of the nurture and protection of a mother and a father. 
No longer did children have to be haunted by the classic fears vividly 
dramatized in folklore and fable--that their parents would die, that they 
would have to live with a stepparent and stepsiblings, or that they would 
be abandoned. These were the years when the nation confidently boarded up 
orphanages and closed foundling hospitals, certain that such institutions 
would never again be needed. In movie theaters across the country parents 
and children could watch the drama of parental separation and death in the 
great Disney classics, secure in the knowledge that such nightmare visions 
as the death of Bambi's mother and the wrenching separation of Dumbo from 
his mother were only make
believe. <P>

In the 1960s the rate of family disruption suddenly began to rise. After 
inching up over the course of a century, the divorce rate soared. 
Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s the divorce rate held steady at fewer 
than ten divorces a year per 1,000 married couples. Then, beginning in 
about 1965, the rate increased sharply, peaking at twenty-three divorces 
per 1,000 marriages by 1979. (In 1974 divorce passed death as the leading 
cause of family breakup.) The rate has leveled off at about twenty-one 
divorces per 1,000 marriages--the figure for 1991. The out-of-wedlock 
birth rate also jumped. It went from five percent in 1960 to 27 percent in 
1990. In 1990 close to 57 percent of births among black mothers were 
nonmarital, and about 17 percent among white mothers. Altogether, about 
one out of every four women who had a child in 1990 was not married. With 
rates of divorce and nonmarital birth so high, family disruption is at its 
peak. Never before have so many children experienced family breakup caused 
by events other than death. Each year a million children go through 
divorce or separation and almost as many more are born out of wedlock. <P>

Half of all marriages now end in divorce. Following divorce, many people 
enter new relationships. Some begin living together. Nearly half of all 
cohabiting couples have children in the household. Fifteen percent have 
new children together. Many cohabiting couples eventually get married. 
However, both cohabiting and remarried couples are more likely to break up 
than couples in first marriages. Even social scientists find it hard to 
keep pace with the complexity and velocity of such patterns. In the 
revised edition (1992) of his book Marriage, Divorce, Remarriage, the 
sociologist Andrew Cherlin ruefully comments: "If there were a 
truth-in-labeling law for books, the title of this edition should be 
something long and unwieldy like Cohabitation, Marriage, Divorce, More 
Cohabitation, and Probably Remarriage."<P>

Under such conditions growing up can be a turbulent experience. In many 
single-parent families children must come to terms with the parent's love life 
and romantic partners. Some children live with cohabiting couples, either 
their own unmarried parents or a biological parent and a live-in partner. 
Some children born to cohabiting parents see their parents break up. 
Others see their parents marry, but 56 percent of them (as compared with 
31 percent of the children born to married parents) later see their 
parents' marriages fall apart. All told, about three quarters of children 
born to cohabiting couples will live in a single-parent home at least 
briefly. One of every four children growing up in the 1990s will 
eventually enter a stepfamily. According to one survey, nearly half of all 
children in stepparent families will see their parents divorce again by 
the time they reach their late teens. Since 80 percent of divorced fathers 
remarry, things get even more complicated when the romantic or marital 
history of the noncustodial parent, usually the father, is taken into 
account. Consequently, as it affects a significant number of children, 
family disruption is best understood not as a single event but as a string 
of disruptive events: separation, divorce, life in a single-parent family, 
life with a parent and live-in lover, the remarriage of one or both 
parents, life in one stepparent family combined with visits to another 
stepparent family; the breakup of one or both stepparent families. And so 
on. This is one reason why public schools have a hard time knowing whom to 
call in an emergency. <P>

Given its dramatic impact on children's lives, one might reasonably expect 
that this historic level of family disruption would be viewed with alarm, 
even regarded as a national crisis. Yet this has not been the case. In 
recent years some people have argued that these trends pose a serious 
threat to children and to the nation as a whole, but they are dismissed as 
declinists, pessimists, or nostalgists, unwilling or unable to accept the 
new facts of life. The dominant view is that the changes in family 
structure are, on balance, positive.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>A Shift in the Social Metric</B><P>
<BR>
There are several reasons why this is so, but the fundamental reason is 
that at some point in the 1970s Americans changed their minds about the 
meaning of these disruptive behaviors. What had once been regarded as 
hostile to children's best interests was now considered essential to 
adults' happiness. In the 1950s most Americans believed that parents 
should stay in an unhappy marriage for the sake of the children. The 
assumption was that a divorce would damage the children, and the prospect 
of such damage gave divorce its meaning. By the mid-1970s a majority of 
Americans rejected that view. Popular advice literature reflected the 
shift. A book on divorce published in the mid-1940s tersely asserted: 
"Children are entitled to the affection and association of two parents, 
not one." Thirty years later another popular divorce book proclaimed just 
the opposite: "A two-parent home is not the only emotional structure 
within which a child can be happy and healthy. . . . The parents who take 
care of themselves will be best able to take care of their children." At 
about the same time, the long-standing taboo against out-of-wedlock 
childbirth also collapsed. By the mid-1970s three fourths of Americans 
said that it was not morally wrong for a woman to have a child outside 
marriage.<P>

Once the social metric shifts from child well-being to adult well-being, 
it is hard to see divorce and nonmarital birth in anything but a positive 
light. However distressing and difficult they may be, both of these 
behaviors can hold out the promise of greater adult choice, freedom, and 
happiness. For unhappy spouses, divorce offers a way to escape a troubled 
or even abusive relationship and make a fresh start. For single parents, 
remarriage is a second try at marital happiness as well as a chance for 
relief from the stress, loneliness, and economic hardship of raising a 
child alone. For some unmarried women, nonmarital birth is a way to beat 
the biological clock, avoid marrying the wrong man, and experience the 
pleasures of motherhood. Moreover, divorce and out-of-wedlock birth 
involve a measure of agency and choice; they are man- and woman-made 
events. To be sure, not everyone exercises choice in divorce or nonmarital 
birth. Men leave wives for younger women, teenage girls get pregnant 
accidentally--yet even these unhappy events reflect the expansion of the 
boundaries of freedom and choice. <P>

This cultural shift helps explain what otherwise would be inexplicable: 
the failure to see the rise in family disruption as a severe and troubling 
national problem. It explains why there is virtually no widespread public 
sentiment for restigmatizing either of these classically disruptive 
behaviors and no sense--no public consensus-
that they can or should be avoided in the future. On the contrary, the 
prevailing opinion is that we should accept the changes in family 
structure as inevitable and devise new forms of public and private support 
for single-parent families.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>The View From Hollywood</b><P>
<BR>
With its affirmation of the liberating effects of divorce and nonmarital 
childbirth, this opinion is a fixture of American popular culture today. 
Madison Avenue and Hollywood did not invent these behaviors, as their 
highly paid publicists are quick to point out, but they have played an 
influential role in defending and even celebrating divorce and unwed 
motherhood. More precisely, they have taken the raw material of demography 
and fashioned it into a powerful fantasy of individual renewal and 
rebirth. Consider, for example, the teaser for People magazine's cover 
story on Joan Lunden's divorce: "After the painful end of her 13-year 
marriage, the Good Morning America cohost is discovering a new life as a 
single mother--and as her own woman." People does not dwell on the anguish 
Lunden and her children might have experienced over the breakup of their 
family, or the difficulties of single motherhood, even for celebrity 
mothers. Instead, it celebrates Joan Lunden's steps toward independence 
and a better life. People, characteristically, focuses on her shopping: in 
the first weeks after her breakup Lunden leased "a brand-new six
bedroom, 8,000 square foot" house and then went to Bloomingdale's, where 
she scooped up sheets, pillows, a toaster, dishes, seven televisions, and 
roomfuls of fun furniture that was "totally unlike the serious traditional 
pieces she was giving up."<P>

This is not just the view taken in supermarket magazines. Even the 
conservative bastion of the greeting-card industry, Hallmark, offers a 
line of cards commemorating divorce as liberation. "Think of your former 
marriage as a record album," says one Contemporary card. "It was full of 
music--both happy and sad. But what's important now is . . . YOU! the 
recently released HOT, NEW, SINGLE! You're going to be at the TOP OF THE 
CHARTS!" Another card reads: "Getting divorced can be very healthy! Watch 
how it improves your circulation! Best of luck! . . . " Hallmark's hip 
Shoebox Greetings division depicts two female praying mantises. Mantis 
One: "It's tough being a single parent." Mantis Two: "Yeah . . . Maybe we 
shouldn't have eaten our husbands."<P>

Divorce is a tired convention in Hollywood, but unwed parenthood is very 
much in fashion: in the past year or so babies were born to Warren Beatty 
and Annette Bening, Jack Nicholson and Rebecca Broussard, and Eddie Murphy 
and Nicole Mitchell. Vanity Fair celebrated Jack Nicholson's fatherhood 
with a cover story (April, 1992) called "Happy Jack." What made Jack 
happy, it turned out, was no-fault fatherhood. He and Broussard, the 
twenty-nine-year-old mother of his children, lived in separate houses. 
Nicholson said, "It's an unusual arrangement, but the last twenty-five 
years or so have shown me that I'm not good at cohabitation. . . . I see 
Rebecca as much as any other person who is cohabiting. And she prefers it. 
I think most people would in a more honest and truthful world." As for 
more-permanent commitments, the man who is not good at cohabitation said: 
"I don't discuss marriage much with Rebecca. Those discussions are the 
very thing I'm trying to avoid. I'm after this immediate real thing. 
That's all I believe in." (Perhaps Nicholson should have had the 
discussion. Not long after the story appeared, Broussard broke off the 
relationship.)<P>

As this story shows, unwed parenthood is thought of not only as a way to 
find happiness but also as a way to exhibit such virtues as honesty and 
courage. A similar argument was offered in defense of Murphy Brown's unwed 
motherhood. Many of Murphy's fans were quick to point out that Murphy 
suffered over her decision to bear a child out of wedlock. Faced with an 
accidental pregnancy and a faithless lover, she agonized over her plight 
and, after much mental anguish, bravely decided to go ahead. In short, 
having a baby without a husband represented a higher level of maternal 
devotion and sacrifice than having a baby with a husband. Murphy was not 
just exercising her rights as a woman; she was exhibiting true moral 
heroism.<P>

On the night Murphy Brown became an unwed mother, 34 million Americans 
tuned in, and CBS posted a 35 percent share of the audience. The show did 
not stir significant protest at the grass roots and lost none of its 
advertisers. The actress Candice Bergen subsequently appeared on <BR>
the cover of nearly every women's and news magazine in the country and 
received an honorary degree at the University of Pennsylvania as well as 
an Emmy award. The show's creator, Diane English, popped up in Hanes 
stocking ads. Judged by conventional measures of approval, Murphy Brown's 
motherhood was a hit at the box office. <P>

Increasingly, the media depicts the married two-parent family as a source 
of pathology. According to a spate of celebrity memoirs and interviews, 
the married
parent family harbors terrible secrets of abuse, violence, and incest. A 
bumper sticker I saw in Amherst, Massachusetts, read unspoken traditional 
Family Values: Abuse, Alcoholism, Incest. The pop therapist John Bradshaw 
explains away this generation's problems with the dictum that 96 percent 
of families are dysfunctional, made that way by the addicted society we 
live in. David Lynch creates a new aesthetic of creepiness by juxtaposing 
scenes of traditional family life with images of seduction and perversion. 
A Boston-area museum puts on an exhibit called "Goodbye to Apple Pie," 
featuring several artists' visions of child abuse, including one 
mixed-media piece with knives poking through a little girl's skirt. The 
piece is titled Father Knows Best. <P>

No one would claim that two-parent families are free from conflict, 
violence, or abuse. However, the attempt to discredit the two-parent 
family can be understood as part of what Daniel Patrick Moynihan has 
described as a larger effort to accommodate higher levels of social 
deviance. "The amount of deviant behavior in American society has 
increased beyond the levels the community can 'afford to recognize,'" 
Moynihan argues. One response has been to normalize what was once 
considered deviant behavior, such as out-of-wedlock birth. An accompanying 
response has been to detect deviance in what once stood as a social norm, 
such as the married-couple family. Together these responses reduce the 
acknowledged levels of deviance by eroding earlier distinctions between 
the normal and the deviant. <P>

Several recent studies describe family life in its postwar heyday as the 
seedbed of alcoholism and abuse. According to Stephanie Coontz, the author 
of the book The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia 
Trap, family life for married mothers in the 1950s consisted of "booze, 
bowling, bridge, and boredom." Coontz writes: "Few would have guessed that 
radiant Marilyn Van Derbur, crowned Miss America in 1958, had been 
sexually violated by her wealthy, respectable father from the time she was 
five until she was eighteen, when she moved away to college." Even the 
budget-stretching casserole comes under attack as a sign of culinary 
dysfunction. According to one food writer, this homely staple of postwar 
family life brings back images of "the good mother of the 50's . . . 
locked in Ozzie and Harriet land, unable to move past the canvas of a 
Corning Ware dish, the palette of a can of Campbell's soup, the mushy 
dominion of which she was queen." <P>

Nevertheless, the popular portrait of family life does not simply reflect 
the views of a cultural elite, as some have argued. There is strong 
support at the grass roots for much of this view of family change. Survey 
after survey shows that Americans are less inclined than they were a 
generation ago to value sexual fidelity, lifelong marriage, and parenthood 
as worthwhile personal goals. Motherhood no longer defines adult 
womanhood, as everyone knows; equally important is the fact that 
fatherhood has declined as a norm for men. In 1976 less than half as many 
fathers as in 1957 said that providing for children was a life goal. The 
proportion of working men who found marriage and children burdensome and 
restrictive more than doubled in the same period. Fewer than half of all 
adult Americans today regard the idea of sacrifice for others as a 
positive moral virtue. <P>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>Dinosaurs Divorce</b><P>
<BR>
It is true that many adults benefit from divorce or remarriage. According 
to one study, nearly 80 percent of divorced women and 50 percent of 
divorced men say they are better off out of the marriage. Half of divorced 
adults in the same study report greater happiness. A competent self-help 
book called Divorce and New Beginnings notes the advantages of single 
parenthood: single parents can "develop their own interests, fulfill their 
own needs, choose their own friends and engage in social activities of 
their choice. Money, even if limited, can be spent as they see fit." 
Apparently, some women appreciate the opportunity to have children out of 
wedlock. "The real world, however, does not always allow women who are 
dedicated to their careers to devote the time and energy it takes to 
find--or be found by--the perfect husband and father wanna-be," one woman 
said in a letter to The Washington Post. A mother and chiropractor from 
Avon, Connecticut, explained her unwed maternity to an interviewer this 
way: "It is selfish, but this was something I needed to do for me."<P>

There is very little in contemporary popular culture to contradict this 
optimistic view. But in a few small places another perspective may be 
found. Several racks down from its divorce cards, Hallmark offers a line 
of cards for children--To Kids With Love. These cards come six to a pack. 
Each card in the pack has a slightly different message. According to the 
package, the "thinking of you" messages will let a special kid "know how 
much you care." Though Hallmark doesn't quite say so, it's clear these 
cards are aimed at divorced parents. "I'm sorry I'm not always there when 
you need me but I hope you know I'm always just a phone call away." 
Another card reads: "Even though your dad and I don't live together 
anymore, I know he's still a very special part of your life. And as much 
as I miss you when you're not with me, I'm still happy that you two can 
spend time together."<P>

Hallmark's messages are grounded in a substantial body of well-funded 
market research. Therefore it is worth reflecting on the divergence in 
sentiment between the divorce cards for adults and the divorce cards for 
kids. For grown-ups, divorce heralds new beginnings (A HOT NEW SINGLE). 
For children, divorce brings separation and loss ("I'm sorry I'm not 
always there when you need me"). <P>

An even more telling glimpse into the meaning of family disruption can be 
found in the growing children's literature on family dissolution. Take, 
for example, the popular children's book Dinosaurs Divorce: A Guide for 
Changing Families (1986), by Laurene Krasny Brown and Marc Brown. This is 
a picture book, written for very young children. The book begins with a 
short glossary of "divorce words" and encourages children to "see if you 
can find them" in the story. The words include "family counselor," 
"separation agreement," "alimony," and "child custody." The book is 
illustrated with cartoonish drawings of green dinosaur parents who fight, 
drink too much, and break up. One panel shows the father dinosaur, 
suitcase in hand, getting into a yellow car.<P>

The dinosaur children are offered simple, straightforward advice on what 
to do about the divorce. On custody decisions: "When parents can't agree, 
lawyers and judges decide. Try to be honest if they ask you questions; it 
will help them make better decisions." On selling the house: "If you move, 
you may have to say good-bye to friends and familiar places. But soon your 
new home will feel like the place you really belong." On the economic 
impact of divorce: "Living with one parent almost always means there will 
be less money. Be prepared to give up some things." On holidays: "Divorce 
may mean twice as much celebrating at holiday times, but you may feel 
pulled apart." On parents' new lovers: "You may sometimes feel jealous and 
want your parent to yourself. Be polite to your parents' new friends, even 
if you don't like them at first." On parents' remarriage: "Not everyone 
loves his or her stepparents, but showing them respect is important." <P>

These cards and books point to an uncomfortable and generally 
unacknowledged fact: what contributes to a parent's happiness may detract 
from a child's happiness. All too often the adult quest for freedom, 
independence, and choice in family relationships conflicts with a child's 
developmental needs for stability, constancy, harmony, and permanence in 
family life. In short, family disruption creates a deep division between 
parents' interests and the interests of children. <P>

One of the worst consequences of these divided interests is a withdrawal 
of parental investment in children's well-being. As the Stanford economist 
Victor Fuchs has pointed out, the main source of social investment in 
children is private. The investment comes from the children's parents. But 
parents in disrupted families have less time, attention, and money to 
devote to their children. The single most important source of 
disinvestment has been the widespread withdrawal of financial support and 
involvement by fathers. Maternal investment, too, has declined, as women 
try to raise families on their own and work outside the home. Moreover, 
both mothers and fathers commonly respond to family breakup by investing 
more heavily in themselves and in their own personal and romantic lives.<P>

Sometimes the tables are completely turned. Children are called upon to 
invest in the emotional well-being of their parents. Indeed, this seems to 
be the larger message of many of the children's books on divorce and 
remarriage. Dinosaurs Divorce asks children to be sympathetic, 
understanding, respectful, and polite to confused, unhappy parents. The 
sacrifice comes from the children: "Be prepared to give up some things." 
In the world of divorcing dinosaurs, the children rather than the 
grown-ups are the exemplars of patience, restraint, and good sense.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>Three Seventies Assumptions</b><P>
<BR>
As it first took shape in the 1970s, the optimistic view of family change 
rested on three bold new assumptions. At that time, because the emergence 
of the changes in family life was so recent, there was little hard 
evidence to confirm or dispute these assumptions. But this was an 
expansive moment in American life.<P>

The first assumption was an economic one: that a woman could now afford to 
be a mother without also being a wife. There were ample grounds for 
believing this. Women's work-force participation had been gradually 
increasing in the postwar period, and by the beginning of the 1970s women 
were a strong presence in the workplace. What's more, even though there 
was still a substantial wage gap between men and women, women had made 
considerable progress in a relatively short time toward better-paying jobs 
and greater employment opportunities. More women than ever before could 
aspire to serious careers as business executives, doctors, lawyers, 
airline pilots, and politicians. This circumstance, combined with the 
increased availability of child care, meant that women could take on the 
responsibilities of a breadwinner, perhaps even a sole breadwinner. This 
was particularly true for middle-class women. According to a highly 
regarded 1977 study by the Carnegie Council on Children, "The greater 
availability of jobs for women means that more middle-class children today 
survive their parents' divorce without a catastrophic plunge into 
poverty." <P>

Feminists, who had long argued that the path to greater equality for women 
lay in the world of work outside the home, endorsed this assumption. In 
fact, for many, economic independence was a stepping-stone toward freedom 
from both men and marriage. As women began to earn their own money, they 
were less dependent on men or marriage, and marriage diminished in 
importance. In Gloria Steinem's memorable words, "A woman without a man is 
like a fish without a bicycle." <P>
<BR>
This assumption also gained momentum as the meaning of work changed for 
women. Increasingly, work had an expressive as well as an economic 
dimension: being a working mother not only gave you an income but also 
made you more interesting and fulfilled than a stay-at-home mother. 
Consequently, the optimistic economic scenario was driven by a cultural 
imperative. Women would achieve financial independence because, culturally 
as well as economically, it was the right thing to do.<P>

The second assumption was that family disruption would not cause lasting 
harm to children and could actually enrich their lives. Creative Divorce: 
A New Opportunity for Personal Growth, a popular book of the seventies, 
spoke confidently to this point: "Children can survive any family crisis 
without permanent damage--and grow as human beings in the process. . . ." 
Moreover, single-parent and stepparent families created a more extensive 
kinship network than the nuclear family. This network would envelop 
children in a web of warm and supportive relationships. "Belonging to a 
stepfamily means there are more people in your life," a children's book 
published in 1982 notes. "More sisters and brothers, including the step 
ones. More people you think of as grandparents and aunts and uncles. More 
cousins. More neighbors and friends. . . . Getting to know and like so 
many people (and having them like you) is one of the best parts of what 
being in a stepfamily . . . is all about." <P>

The third assumption was that the new diversity in family structure would 
make America a better place. Just as the nation has been strengthened by 
the diversity of its ethnic and racial groups, so it would be strengthened 
by diverse family forms. The emergence of these brave new families was but 
the latest chapter in the saga of American pluralism. <P>

Another version of the diversity argument stated that the real problem was 
not family disruption itself but the stigma still attached to these 
emergent family forms. This lingering stigma placed children at 
psychological risk, making them feel ashamed or different; as the ranks of 
single-parent and stepparent families grew, children would feel normal and 
good about themselves.<P>
<BR>
These assumptions continue to be appealing, because they accord with 
strongly held American beliefs in social progress. Americans see progress 
in the expansion of individual opportunities for choice, freedom, and 
self-expression. Moreover, Americans identify progress with growing 
tolerance of diversity. Over the past half century, the pollster Daniel 
Yankelovich writes, the United States has steadily grown more open-minded 
and accepting of groups that were previously perceived as alien, 
untrustworthy, or unsuitable for public leadership or social esteem. One 
such group is the burgeoning number of single-parent and stepparent 
families. <P>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>The Education of Sara McLanahan</b><P>
<BR>
In 1981 Sara McLanahan, now a sociologist at Princeton University's 
Woodrow Wilson School, read a three-part series by Ken Auletta in The New 
Yorker. Later published as a book titled The Underclass, the series 
presented a vivid portrait of the drug addicts, welfare mothers, and 
school dropouts who took part in an education
and-training program in New York City. Many were the children of single 
mothers, and it was Auletta's clear implication that single-mother 
families were contributing to the growth of an underclass. McLanahan was 
taken aback by this notion. "It struck me as strange that he would be 
viewing single mothers at that level of pathology."<P>

"I'd gone to graduate school in the days when the politically correct 
argument was that single-parent families were just another alternative 
family form, and it was fine," McLanahan explains, as she recalls the 
state of social-scientific thinking in the 1970s. Several empirical 
studies that were then current supported an optimistic view of family 
change. (They used tiny samples, however, and did not track the well-being 
of children over time.) 
One, All Our Kin, by Carol Stack, was required reading for thousands of 
university students. It said that single mothers had strengths that had 
gone undetected and unappreciated by earlier researchers. The 
single-mother family, it suggested, is an economically resourceful and 
socially embedded institution. In the late 1970s McLanahan wrote a similar 
study that looked at a small sample of white single mothers and how they 
coped. "So I was very much of that tradition." <P>

By the early 1980s, however, nearly two decades had passed since the 
changes in family life had begun. During the intervening years a fuller 
body of empirical research had emerged: studies that used large samples, 
or followed families through time, or did both. Moreover, several of the 
studies offered a child's-eye view of family disruption. The National 
Survey on Children, conducted by the psychologist Nicholas Zill, had set 
out in 1976 to track a large sample of children aged seven to eleven. It 
also interviewed the children's parents and teachers. It surveyed its 
subjects again in 1981 and 1987. By the time of its third round of 
interviews the eleven-year-olds of 1976 were the twenty-two-year-olds of 
1987. The California Children of Divorce Study, directed by Judith 
Wallerstein, a clinical psychologist, had also been going on for a decade. 
E. Mavis Hetherington, of the University of Virginia, was conducting a 
similar study of children from both intact and divorced families. For the 
first time it was possible to test the optimistic view against a large and 
longitudinal body of evidence.<P>

It was to this body of evidence that Sara McLanahan turned. When she did, 
she found little to support the optimistic view of single motherhood. On 
the contrary. When she published her findings with Irwin Garfinkel in a 
1986 book, Single Mothers and Their Children, her portrait of single 
motherhood proved to be as troubling in its own way as Auletta's.<P>

One of the leading assumptions of the time was that single motherhood was 
economically viable. Even if single mothers did face economic trials, they 
wouldn't face them for long, it was argued, because they wouldn't remain 
single for long: single motherhood would be a brief phase of three to five 
years, followed by marriage. Single mothers would be economically 
resilient: if they experienced setbacks, they would recover quickly. It 
was also said that single mothers would be supported by informal networks 
of family, friends, neighbors, and other single mothers. As McLanahan 
shows in her study, the evidence demolishes all these claims. <P>

For the vast majority of single mothers, the economic spectrum turns out 
to be narrow, running between precarious and desperate. Half the single 
mothers in the United States live below the poverty line. (Currently, one 
out of ten married couples with children is poor.) Many others live on the 
edge of poverty. Even single mothers who are far from poor are likely to 
experience persistent economic insecurity. Divorce almost always brings a 
decline in the standard of living for the mother and children.<P>

Moreover, the poverty experienced by single mothers is no more brief than 
it is mild. A significant number of all single mothers never marry or 
remarry. Those who do, do so only after spending roughly six years, on 
average, as single parents. For black mothers the duration is much longer. 
Only 33 percent of African
American mothers had remarried within ten years of separation. 
Consequently, single motherhood is hardly a fleeting event for the mother, 
and it is likely to occupy a third of the child's childhood. Even the 
notion that single mothers are knit together in economically supportive 
networks is not borne out by the evidence. On the contrary, single 
parenthood forces many women to be on the move, in search of cheaper 
housing and better jobs. This need-driven restless mobility makes it more 
difficult for them to sustain supportive ties to family and friends, let 
alone other single mothers.<P>

Single-mother families are vulnerable not just to poverty but to a 
particularly debilitating form of poverty: welfare dependency. The 
dependency takes two forms: First, single mothers, particularly unwed 
mothers, stay on welfare longer than other welfare recipients. Of those 
never-married mothers who receive welfare benefits, al
most 40 percent remain on the rolls for ten years or longer. Second, 
welfare dependency tends to be passed on from one generation to the next. 
McLanahan says, "Evidence on intergenerational poverty indicates that, 
indeed, offspring from [single-mother] families are far more likely to be 
poor and to form mother-only families than are offspring who live with two 
parents most of their pre-adult life." Nor is the intergenerational impact 
of single motherhood limited to African
Americans, as many people seem to believe. Among white families, daughters 
of single parents are 53 percent more likely to marry as teenagers, 111 
percent more likely to have children as teenagers, 164 percent more likely 
to have a premarital birth, and 92 percent more likely to dissolve their 
own marriages. All these intergenerational consequences of single 
motherhood increase the likelihood of chronic welfare dependency. <P>

McLanahan cites three reasons why single-mother families are so vulnerable 
economically. For one thing, their earnings are low. Second, unless the 
mothers are widowed, they don't receive public subsidies large enough to 
lift them out of poverty. And finally, they do not get much support from 
family members--
especially the fathers of their children. In 1982 single white mothers 
received an average of $1,246 in alimony and child support, black mothers 
an average of $322. Such payments accounted for about 10 percent of the 
income of single white mothers and for about 3.5 percent of the income of 
single black mothers. These amounts were dramatically smaller than the 
income of the father in a two-parent family and also smaller than the 
income from a second earner in a two-parent family. Roughly 60 percent of 
single white mothers and 80 percent of single black mothers received no 
support at all.<P>

Until the mid-1980s, when stricter standards were put in place, 
child-support awards were only about half to two-thirds what the current 
guidelines require. Accordingly, there is often a big difference in the 
living standards of divorced fathers and of divorced mothers with 
children. After divorce the average annual income of mothers and children 
is $13,500 for whites and $9,000 for nonwhites, as compared with $25,000 
for white nonresident fathers and $13,600 for nonwhite nonresident 
fathers. Moreover, since child-support awards account for a smaller 
portion of the income of a high-earning father, the drop in living 
standards can be especially sharp for mothers who were married to 
upper-level managers and professionals.<P>

Unwed mothers are unlikely to be awarded any child support at all, partly 
because the paternity of their children may not have been established. 
According to one recent study, only 20 percent of unmarried mothers 
receive child support. Even if single mothers escape poverty, economic 
uncertainty remains a condition of life. Divorce brings a reduction in 
income and standard of living for the vast majority of single mothers. One 
study, for example, found that income for mothers and children declines on 
average about 30 percent, while fathers experience a 10 to 15 percent 
increase in income in the year following a separation. Things get even 
more difficult when fathers fail to meet their child-support obligations. 
As a result, many divorced mothers experience a wearing uncertainty about 
the family budget: whether the check will come in or not; whether new 
sneakers can be bought this month or not; whether the electric bill will 
be paid on time or not. Uncertainty about money triggers other kinds of 
uncertainty. Mothers and children often have to move to cheaper housing 
after a divorce. One study shows that about 38 percent of divorced mothers 
and their children move during the first year after a divorce. Even 
several years later the rate of moves for single mothers is about a third 
higher than the rate for two-parent families. It is also common for a 
mother to change her job or increase her working hours or both following a 
divorce. Even the composition of the household is likely to change, with 
other adults, such as boyfriends or babysitters, moving in and out. <P>

All this uncertainty can be devastating to children. Anyone who knows 
children knows that they are deeply conservative creatures. They like 
things to stay the same. So pronounced is this tendency that certain 
children have been known to request the same peanut-butter-and-jelly 
sandwich for lunch for years on end. Children are particularly set in 
their ways when it comes to family, friends, neighborhoods, and schools. 
Yet when a family breaks up, all these things may change. The novelist Pat 
Conroy has observed that "each divorce is the death of a small 
civilization." No one feels this more acutely than children. <P>

Sara McLanahan's investigation and others like it have helped to establish 
a broad consensus on the economic impact of family disruption on children. 
Most social scientists now agree that single motherhood is an important 
and growing cause of poverty, and that children suffer as a result. (They 
continue to argue, however, about the relationship between family 
structure and such economic factors as income inequality, the loss of jobs 
in the inner city, and the growth of low-wage jobs.) By the mid-1980s, 
however, it was clear that the problem of family disruption was not 
confined to the urban underclass, nor was its sole impact economic. 
Divorce and out-of-wedlock childbirth were affecting middle- and 
upper-class children, and these more privileged children were suffering 
negative consequences as well. It appeared that the problems associated 
with family breakup were far deeper and far more widespread than anyone 
had previously imagined.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>The Missing Father</b><P>
<BR>
Judith Wallerstein is one of the pioneers in research on the long-term 
psychological impact of family disruption on children. The California 
Children of Divorce Study, which she directs, remains the most enduring 
study of the long-term effects of divorce on children and their parents. 
Moreover, it represents the best-known effort to look at the impact of 
divorce on middle-class children. The California children entered the 
study without pathological family histories. Before divorce they lived in 
stable, protected homes. And although some of the children did experience 
economic insecurity as the result of divorce, they were generally free 
from the most severe forms of poverty associated with family breakup. Thus 
the study and the resulting book (which Wallerstein wrote with Sandra 
Blakeslee), Second Chances: Men, Women, and Children a Decade After 
Divorce (1989), provide new insight into the consequences of divorce which 
are not associated with extreme forms of economic or emotional 
deprivation.<P>

When, in 1971, Wallerstein and her colleagues set out to conduct clinical 
interviews with 131 children from the San Francisco area, they thought 
they were embarking on a short-term study. Most experts believed that 
divorce was like a bad cold. There was a phase of acute discomfort, and 
then a short recovery phase. According to the conventional wisdom, kids 
would be back on their feet in no time at all. Yet when Wallerstein met 
these children for a second interview more than a year later, she was 
amazed to discover that there had been no miraculous recovery. In fact, 
the children seemed to be doing worse. <P>

The news that children did not "get over" divorce was not particularly 
welcome at the time. Wallerstein recalls, "We got angry letters from 
therapists, parents, and lawyers saying we were undoubtedly wrong. They 
said children are really much better off being released from an unhappy 
marriage. Divorce, they said, is a liberating experience." One of the main 
results of the California study was to overturn this optimistic view. In 
Wallerstein's cautionary words, "Divorce is deceptive. Legally it is a 
single event, but psychologically it is a chain--sometimes a never-ending 
chain--of events, relocations, and radically shifting relationships strung 
through time, a process that forever changes the lives of the people 
involved." <P>

Five years after divorce more than a third of the children experienced 
moderate or severe depression. At ten years a significant number of the 
now young men and women appeared to be troubled, drifting, and 
underachieving. At fifteen years many of the thirtyish adults were 
struggling to establish strong love relationships of their own. In short, 
far from recovering from their parents' divorce, a significant percentage 
of these grownups were still suffering from its effects. In fact, 
according to Wallerstein, the long-term effects of divorce emerge at a 
time when young adults are trying to make their own decisions about love, 
marriage, and family. Not all children in the study suffered negative 
consequences. But Wallerstein's research presents a sobering picture of 
divorce. "The child of divorce faces many additional psychological burdens 
in addition to the normative tasks of growing up," she says. <P>

Divorce not only makes it more difficult for young adults to establish new 
relationships. It also weakens the oldest primary relationship: that 
between parent and child. According to Wallerstein, "Parent-child 
relationships are permanently altered by divorce in ways that our society 
has not anticipated." Not only do children experience a loss of parental 
attention at the onset of divorce, but they soon find that at every stage 
of their development their parents are not available in the same way they 
once were. "In a reasonably happy intact family," Wallerstein observes, 
"the child gravitates first to one parent and then to the other, using 
skills and attributes from each in climbing the developmental ladder." In 
a divorced family, children find it "harder to find the needed parent at 
needed times." This may help explain why very young children suffer the 
most as the result of family disruption. Their opportunities to engage in 
this kind of ongoing process are the most truncated and compromised. <P>

The father-child bond is severely, often irreparably, damaged in disrupted 
families. In a situation without historical precedent, an astonishing and 
disheartening number of American fathers are failing to provide financial 
support to their children. Often, more than the father's support check is 
missing. Increasingly, children are bereft of any contact with their 
fathers. According to the National Survey of Children, in disrupted 
families only one child in six, on average, saw his or her father as often 
as once a week in the past year. Close to half did not see their father at 
all in the past year. As time goes on, contact becomes even more 
infrequent. Ten years after a marriage breaks up, more than two thirds of 
children report not having seen their father for a year. Not surprisingly, 
when asked to name the "adults you look up to and admire," only 20 percent 
of children in single-parent families named their father, as compared with 
52 percent of children in two-parent families. A favorite complaint among 
Baby Boom Americans is that their fathers were emotionally remote guys who 
worked hard, came home at night to eat supper, and didn't have much to say 
to or do with the kids. But the current generation has a far worse father 
problem: many of their fathers are vanishing entirely. <P>

Even for fathers who maintain regular contact, the pattern of father-child 
relationships changes. The sociologists Andrew Cherlin and Frank 
Furstenberg, who have studied broken families, write that the fathers 
behave more like other relatives than like parents. Rather than helping 
with homework or carrying out a project with their children, 
nonresidential fathers are likely to take the kids shopping, to the 
movies, or out to dinner. Instead of providing steady advice and guidance, 
divorced fathers become "treat" dads. <P>

Apparently--and paradoxically--it is the visiting relationship itself, 
rather than the frequency of visits, that is the real source of the 
problem. According to Wallerstein, the few children in the California 
study who reported visiting with their fathers once or twice a week over a 
ten-year period still felt rejected. The need to schedule a special time 
to be with the child, the repeated leave-takings, and the lack of 
connection to the child's regular, daily schedule leaves many fathers 
adrift, frustrated, and confused. Wallerstein calls the visiting father a 
parent without portfolio. <P>

The deterioration in father-child bonds is most severe among children who 
experience divorce at an early age, according to a recent study. Nearly 
three quarters of the respondents, now young men and women, report having 
poor relationships with their fathers. Close to half have received 
psychological help, nearly a third have dropped out of high school, and 
about a quarter report having experienced high levels of problem behavior 
or emotional distress by the time they became young adults.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>Long-Term Effects</b><P>
<BR>
Since most children live with their mothers after divorce, one might 
expect that the mother-child bond would remain unaltered and might even be 
strengthened. Yet research shows that the mother-child bond is also 
weakened as the result of divorce. Only half of the children who were 
close to their mothers before a divorce remained equally close after the 
divorce. Boys, particularly, had difficulties with their mothers. 
Moreover, mother-child relationships deteriorated over time. Whereas 
teenagers in disrupted families were no more likely than teenagers in 
intact families to report poor relationships with their mothers, 30 
percent of young adults from disrupted families have poor relationships 
with their mothers, as compared with 16 percent of young adults from 
intact families. Mother-daughter relationships often deteriorate as the 
daughter reaches young adulthood. The only group in society that derives 
any benefit from these weakened parent-child ties is the therapeutic 
community. Young adults from disrupted families are nearly twice as likely 
as those from intact families to receive psychological help. <P>

Some social scientists have criticized Judith Wallerstein's research 
because her study is based on a small clinical sample and does not include 
a control group of children from intact families. However, other studies 
generally support and strengthen her findings. Nicholas Zill has found 
similar long-term effects on children of divorce, reporting that "effects 
of marital discord and family disruption are visible twelve to twenty-two 
years later in poor relationships with parents, high levels of problem 
behavior, and an increased likelihood of dropping out of high school and 
receiving psychological help." Moreover, Zill's research also found signs 
of distress in young women who seemed relatively well adjusted in middle 
childhood and adolescence. Girls in single-parent families are also at 
much greater risk for precocious sexuality, teenage marriage, teenage 
pregnancy, nonmarital birth, and divorce than are girls in two-parent 
families.<P>

Zill's research shows that family disruption strongly affects school 
achievement as well. Children in disrupted families are nearly twice as 
likely as those in intact families to drop out of high school; among 
children who do drop out, those from disrupted families are less likely 
eventually to earn a diploma or a GED. Boys are at greater risk for 
dropping out than girls, and are also more likely to exhibit aggressive, 
acting-out behaviors. Other research confirms these findings. According to 
a study by the National Association of Elementary School Principals, 33 
percent of two-parent elementary school students are ranked as high 
achievers, as compared with 17 percent of single-parent students. The 
children in single-parent families are also more likely to be truant or 
late or to have disciplinary action taken against them. Even after 
controlling for race, income, and religion, scholars find significant 
differences in educational attainment between children who grow up in 
intact families and children who do not. In his 1992 study America's 
Smallest School: The Family, Paul Barton shows that the proportion of 
two-parent families varies widely from state to state and is related to 
variations in academic achievement. North Dakota, for example, scores 
highest on the math-proficiency test and second highest on the 
two-parent-family scale. The District of Columbia is second lowest on the 
math test and lowest in the nation on the two-parent-family scale.<P>

Zill notes that "while coming from a disrupted family significantly 
increases a young adult's risks of experiencing social, emotional or 
academic difficulties, it does not foreordain such difficulties. The 
majority of young people from disrupted families have successfully 
completed high school, do not currently display high levels of emotional 
distress or problem behavior, and enjoy reasonable relationships with 
their mothers." Nevertheless, a majority of these young adults do show 
maladjustment in their relationships with their fathers.
<P>
These findings underscore the importance of both a mother and a father in 
fostering the emotional well-being of children. Obviously, not all 
children in two-parent families are free from emotional turmoil, but few 
are burdened with the troubles that accompany family breakup. Moreover, as 
the sociologist Amitai Etzioni explains in a new book, The Spirit of 
Community, two parents in an intact family make up what might be called a 
mutually supportive education coalition. When both parents are present, 
they can play different, even contradictory, roles. One parent may goad 
the child to achieve, while the other may encourage the child to take time 
out to daydream or toss a football around. One may emphasize taking 
intellectual risks, while the other may insist on following the teacher's 
guidelines. At the same time, the parents regularly exchange information 
about the child's school problems and achievements, and have a sense of 
the overall educational mission. However, Etzioni writes, <P>

The sequence of divorce followed by a succession of boy or girlfriends, a 
second marriage, and frequently another divorce and another turnover of 
partners often means a repeatedly disrupted educational coalition. Each 
change in participants involves a change in the educational agenda for the 
child. Each new partner cannot be expected to pick up the previous one's 
educational post and program. . . . As a result, changes in parenting 
partners mean, at best, a deep disruption in a child's education, though 
of course several disruptions cut deeper into the effectiveness of the 
educational coalition than just one.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>The Bad News About Stepparents</b><P>
<BR>
Perhaps the most striking, and potentially disturbing, new research has to 
do with children in stepparent families. Until quite recently the 
optimistic assumption was that children saw their lives improve when they 
became part of a stepfamily. When Nicholas Zill and his colleagues began 
to study the effects of remarriage on children, their working hypothesis 
was that stepparent families would make up for the shortcomings of the 
single-parent family. Clearly, most children are better off economically 
when they are able to share in the income of two adults. When a second 
adult joins the household, there may be a reduction in the time and work 
pressures on the single parent. <P>

The research overturns this optimistic assumption, however. In general the 
evidence suggests that remarriage neither reproduces nor restores the 
intact family structure, even when it brings more income and a second 
adult into the household. Quite the contrary. Indeed, children living with 
stepparents appear to be even more disadvantaged than children living in a 
stable single-parent family. Other difficulties seem to offset the 
advantages of extra income and an extra pair of hands. However much our 
modern sympathies reject the fairy-tale portrait of stepparents, the 
latest research confirms that the old stories are anthropologically quite 
accurate. Stepfamilies disrupt established loyalties, create new 
uncertainties, provoke deep anxieties, and sometimes threaten a child's 
physical safety as well as emotional security.<P>

Parents and children have dramatically different interests in and 
expectations for a new marriage. For a single parent, remarriage brings 
new commitments, the hope of enduring love and happiness, and relief from 
stress and loneliness. For a child, the same event often provokes confused 
feelings of sadness, anger, and rejection. Nearly half the children in 
Wallerstein's study said they felt left out in their stepfamilies. The 
National Commission on Children, a bipartisan group headed by Senator John 
D. Rockefeller, of West Virginia, reported that children from stepfamilies 
were more likely to say they often felt lonely or blue than children from 
either single-parent or intact families. Children in stepfamilies were the 
most likely to report that they wanted more time with their mothers. When 
mothers remarry, daughters tend to have a harder time adjusting than sons. 
Evidently, boys often respond positively to a male presence in the 
household, while girls who have established close ties to their mother in 
a single-parent family often see the stepfather as a rival and an 
intruder. According to one study, boys in remarried families are less 
likely to drop out of school than boys in single-parent families, while 
the opposite is true for girls.<P>

A large percentage of children do not even consider stepparents to be part 
of their families, according to the National Survey on Children. The NSC 
asked children, "When you think of your family, who do you include?" Only 
10 percent of the children failed to mention a biological parent, but a 
third left out a stepparent. Even children who rarely saw their 
noncustodial parents almost always named them as family members. The weak 
sense of attachment is mutual. When parents were asked the same question, 
only one percent failed to mention a biological child, while 15 percent 
left out a stepchild. In the same study stepparents with both natural 
children and stepchildren said that it was harder for them to love their 
stepchildren than their biological children and that their children would 
have been better off if they had grown up with two biological parents.<P>

One of the most severe risks associated with stepparent-child ties is the 
risk of sexual abuse. As Judith Wallerstein explains, "The presence of a 
stepfather can raise the difficult issue of a thinner incest barrier." The 
incest taboo is strongly reinforced, Wallerstein says, by knowledge of 
paternity and by the experience of caring for a child since birth. A 
stepfather enters the family without either credential and plays a sexual 
role as the mother's husband. As a result, stepfathers can pose a sexual 
risk to the children, especially to daughters. According to a study by the 
Canadian researchers Martin Daly and Margo Wilson, preschool children in 
stepfamilies are forty times as likely as children in intact families to 
suffer physical or sexual abuse. (Most of the sexual abuse was committed 
by a third party, such as a neighbor, a stepfather's male friend, or 
another nonrelative.) Stepfathers discriminate in their abuse: they are 
far more likely to assault nonbiological children than their own natural 
children.<P>

Sexual abuse represents the most extreme threat to children's well-being. 
Stepfamilies also seem less likely to make the kind of ordinary 
investments in the children that other families do. Although it is true 
that the stepfamily household has a higher income than the single-parent 
household, it does not follow that the additional income is reliably 
available to the children. To begin with, children's claim on stepparents' 
resources is shaky. Stepparents are not legally required to support 
stepchildren, so their financial support of these children is entirely 
voluntary. Moreover, since stepfamilies are far more likely to break up 
than intact families, particularly in the first five years, there is 
always the risk--far greater than the risk of unemployment in an intact 
family--that the second income will vanish with another divorce. The 
financial commitment to a child's education appears weaker in stepparent 
families, perhaps because the stepparent believes that the responsibility 
for educating the child rests with the biological parent.<P>

Similarly, studies suggest that even though they may have the time, the 
parents in stepfamilies do not invest as much of it in their children as 
the parents in intact families or even single parents do. A 1991 survey by 
the National Commission on Children showed that the parents in 
stepfamilies were less likely to be involved in a child's school life, 
including involvement in extracurricular activities, than either 
intact-family parents or single parents. They were the least likely to 
report being involved in such time-consuming activities as coaching a 
child's team, accompanying class trips, or helping with school projects. 
According to McLanahan's research, children in stepparent families report 
lower educational aspirations on the part of their parents and lower 
levels of parental involvement with schoolwork. In short, it appears that 
family income and the number of adults in the household are not the only 
factors affecting children's well-being.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>Diminishing Investments</b><P>
<BR>
There are several reasons for this diminished interest and investment. In 
the law, as in the children's eyes, stepparents are shadowy figures. 
According to the legal scholar David Chambers, family law has pretty much 
ignored stepparents. Chambers writes, "In the substantial majority of 
states, stepparents, even when they live with a child, have no legal 
obligation to contribute to the child's support; nor does a stepparent's 
presence in the home alter the support obligations of a noncustodial 
parent. The stepparent also has . . . no authority to approve emergency 
medical treatment or even to sign a permission slip. . . ." When a 
marriage breaks up, the stepparent has no continuing obligation to provide 
for a stepchild, no matter how long or how much he or she has been 
contributing to the support of the child. In short, Chambers says, 
stepparent relationships are based wholly on consent, subject to the 
inclinations of the adult and the child. The only way a stepparent can 
acquire the legal status of a parent is through adoption. Some researchers 
also point to the cultural ambiguity of the stepparent's role as a source 
of diminished interest, while others insist that it is the absence of a 
blood tie that weakens the bond between stepparent and child.<P>

Whatever its causes, the diminished investment in children in both 
single-parent and stepparent families has a significant impact on their 
life chances. Take parental help with college costs. The parents in intact 
families are far more likely to contribute to children's college costs 
than are those in disrupted families. Moreover, they are usually able to 
arrive at a shared understanding of which children will go to college, 
where they will go, how much the parents will contribute, and how much the 
children will contribute. But when families break up, these informal 
understandings can vanish. The issue of college tuition remains one of the 
most contested areas of parental support, especially for higher-income 
parents.<P>

The law does not step in even when familial understandings break down. In 
the 1980s many states lowered the age covered by child-support agreements 
from twenty-one to eighteen, thus eliminating college as a cost associated 
with support for a minor child. Consequently, the question of college 
tuition is typically not addressed in child-custody agreements. Even in 
states where the courts do require parents to contribute to college costs, 
the requirement may be in jeopardy. In a recent decision in Pennsylvania 
the court overturned an earlier decision ordering divorced parents to 
contribute to college tuition. This decision is likely to inspire 
challenges in other states where courts have required parents to pay for 
college. Increasingly, help in paying for college is entirely voluntary.<P>

Judith Wallerstein has been analyzing the educational decisions of the 
college-age men and women in her study. She reports that "a full 42 
percent of these men and women from middle class families appeared to have 
ended their educations without attempting college or had left college 
before achieving a degree at either the two-year or the four-year level." 
A significant percentage of these young people have the ability to attend 
college. Typical of this group are Nick and Terry, sons of a college 
professor. They had been close to their father before the divorce, but 
their father remarried soon after the divorce and saw his sons only 
occasionally, even though he lived nearby. At age nineteen Nick had 
completed a few junior-college courses and was earning a living as a 
salesman. Terry, twenty-one, who had been tested as a gifted student, was 
doing blue-collar work irregularly. <P>

Sixty-seven percent of the college-age students from disrupted families 
attended college, as compared with 85 percent of other students who 
attended the same high schools. Of those attending college, several had 
fathers who were financially capable of contributing to college costs but 
did not. 
The withdrawal of support for college suggests that other customary forms 
of parental help-giving, too, may decline as the result of family breakup. 
For example, nearly a quarter of first-home purchases since 1980 have 
involved help from relatives, usually parents. The median amount of help 
is $5,000. It is hard to imagine that parents who refuse to contribute to 
college costs will offer help in buying first homes, or help in buying 
cars or health insurance for young adult family members. And although it 
is too soon to tell, family disruption may affect the generational 
transmission of wealth. Baby Boomers will inherit their parents' estates, 
some substantial, accumulated over a lifetime by parents who lived and 
saved together. To be sure, the postwar generation benefited from an 
expanding economy and a rising standard of living, but its ability to 
accumulate wealth also owed something to family stability. The lifetime 
assets, like the marriage itself, remained intact. It is unlikely that the 
children of disrupted families will be in so favorable a position.<P>

Moreover, children from disrupted families may be less likely to help 
their aging parents. The sociologist Alice Rossi, who has studied 
intergenerational patterns of help-giving, says that adult obligation has 
its roots in early-childhood experience. Children who grow up in intact 
families experience higher levels of obligation to kin than children from 
broken families. Children's sense of obligation to a nonresidential father 
is particularly weak. Among adults with both parents living, those 
separated from their father during childhood are less likely than others 
to see the father regularly. Half of them see their father more than once 
a year, as compared with nine out of ten of those whose parents are still 
married. Apparently a kind of bitter justice is at work here. Fathers who 
do not support or see their young children may not be able to count on 
their adult children's support when they are old and need money, love, and 
attention.<P>

In short, as Andrew Cherlin and Frank Furstenburg put it, "Through divorce 
and remarriage, individuals are related to more and more people, to each 
of whom they owe less and less." Moreover, as Nicholas Zill argues, weaker 
parent-child attachments leave many children more strongly exposed to 
influences outside the family, such as peers, boyfriends or girlfriends, 
and the media. Although these outside forces can sometimes be helpful, 
common sense and research opinion argue against putting too much faith in 
peer groups or the media as surrogates for Mom and Dad.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>Poverty, Crime, Education</b><P>
<BR>
Family disruption would be a serious problem even if it affected only 
individual children and families. But its impact is far broader. Indeed, 
it is not an exaggeration to characterize it as a central cause of many of 
our most vexing social problems. Consider three problems that most 
Americans believe rank among the nation's pressing concerns: poverty, 
crime, and declining school performance.<P>

More than half of the increase in child poverty in the 1980s is 
attributable to changes in family structure, according to David Eggebeen 
and Daniel Lichter, of Pennsylvania State University. In fact, if family 
structure in the United States had remained relatively constant since 
1960, the rate of child poverty would be a third lower than it is today. 
This does not bode well for the future. With more than half of today's 
children likely to live in single-parent families, poverty and associated 
welfare costs threaten to become even heavier burdens on the nation.<P>

Crime in American cities has increased dramatically and grown more violent 
over recent decades. Much of this can be attributed to the rise in 
disrupted families. Nationally, more than 70 percent of all juveniles in 
state reform institutions come from fatherless homes. A number of 
scholarly studies find that even after the groups of subjects are 
controlled for income, boys from single-mother homes are significantly 
more likely than others to commit crimes and to wind up in the juvenile 
justice, court, and penitentiary systems. One such study summarizes the 
relationship between crime and one-parent families in this way: "The 
relationship is so strong that controlling for family configuration erases 
the relationship between race and crime and between low income and crime. 
This conclusion shows up time and again in the literature." The nation's 
mayors, as well as police officers, social workers, probation officers, 
and court officials, consistently point to family breakup as the most 
important source of rising rates of crime.<P>

Terrible as poverty and crime are, they tend to be concentrated in inner 
cities and isolated from the everyday experience of many Americans. The 
same cannot be said of the problem of declining school performance. 
Nowhere has the impact of family breakup been more profound or widespread 
than in the nation's public schools. There is a strong consensus that the 
schools are failing in their historic mission to prepare every American 
child to be a good worker and a good citizen. And nearly everyone agrees 
that the schools must undergo dramatic reform in order to reach that goal. 
In pursuit of that goal, moreover, we have suffered no shortage of bright 
ideas or pilot projects or bold experiments in school reform. But there is 
little evidence that measures such as curricular reform, school-based 
management, and school choice will address, let alone solve, the biggest 
problem schools face: the rising number of children who come from 
disrupted families.<P>

The great educational tragedy of our time is that many American children 
are failing in school not because they are intellectually or physically 
impaired but because they are emotionally incapacitated. In schools across 
the nation principals report a dramatic rise in the aggressive, acting-out 
behavior characteristic of children, especially boys, who are living in 
single-parent families. The discipline problems in today's suburban 
schools--assaults on teachers, unprovoked attacks on other students, 
screaming outbursts in class--outstrip the problems that were evident in 
the toughest city schools a generation ago. Moreover, teachers find many 
children emotionally distracted, so upset and preoccupied by the explosive 
drama of their own family lives that they are unable to concentrate on 
such mundane matters as multiplication tables. <P>

In response, many schools have turned to therapeutic remediation. A 
growing proportion of many school budgets is devoted to counseling and 
other psychological services. The curriculum is becoming more therapeutic: 
children are taking courses in self-esteem, conflict resolution, and 
aggression management. Parental advisory groups are conscientiously 
debating alternative approaches to traditional school discipline, ranging 
from teacher training in mediation to the introduction of metal detectors 
and security guards in the schools. Schools are increasingly becoming 
emergency rooms of the emotions, devoted not only to developing minds but 
also to repairing hearts. As a result, the mission of the school, along 
with the culture of the classroom, is slowly changing. What we are seeing, 
largely as a result of the new burdens of family disruption, is the 
psychologization of American education.<P>

Taken together, the research presents a powerful challenge to the 
prevailing view of family change as social progress. Not a single one of 
the assumptions underlying that view can be sustained against the 
empirical evidence. Single-parent families are not able to do well 
economically on a mother's income. In fact, most teeter on the economic 
brink, and many fall into poverty and welfare dependency. Growing up in a 
disrupted family does not enrich a child's life or expand the number of 
adults committed to the child's well-being. In fact, disrupted families 
threaten the psychological well-being of children and diminish the 
investment of adult time and money in them. Family diversity in the form 
of increasing numbers of single-parent and stepparent families does not 
strengthen the social fabric. It dramatically weakens and undermines 
society, placing new burdens on schools, courts, prisons, and the welfare 
system. These new families are not an improvement on the nuclear family, 
nor are they even just as good, whether you look at outcomes for children 
or outcomes for society as a whole. In short, far from representing social 
progress, family change represents a stunning example of social regress.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>The Two-Parent Advantage</b><P>
<BR>
All this evidence gives rise to an obvious conclusion: growing up in an 
intact two-parent family is an important source of advantage for American children. 
Though far from perfect as a social institution, the intact family offers 
children greater security and better outcomes than its fast-growing 
alternatives: single-parent and stepparent families. Not only does the 
intact family protect the child from poverty and economic insecurity; it 
also provides greater noneconomic investments of parental time, attention, 
and emotional support over the entire life course. This does not mean that 
all two-parent families are better for children than all single
parent families. But in the face of the evidence it becomes increasingly 
difficult to sustain the proposition that all family structures produce 
equally good outcomes for children. <P>

Curiously, many in the research community are hesitant to say that 
two-parent families generally promote better outcomes for children than 
single-parent families. Some argue that we need finer measures of the 
extent of the family-structure effect. As one scholar has noted, it is 
possible, by disaggregating the data in certain ways, to make family 
structure "go away" as an independent variable. Other researchers point to 
studies that show that children suffer psychological effects as a result 
of family conflict preceding family breakup. Consequently, they reason, it 
is the conflict rather than the structure of the family that is 
responsible for many of the problems associated with family disruption. 
Others, including Judith Wallerstein, caution against treating children in 
divorced families and children in intact families as separate populations, 
because doing so tends to exaggerate the differences between the two 
groups. "We have to take this family by family," Wallerstein says.<P>

Some of the caution among researchers can also be attributed to 
ideological pressures. Privately, social scientists worry that their 
research may serve ideological causes that they themselves do not support, 
or that their work may be misinterpreted as an attempt to "tell people 
what to do." Some are fearful that they will be attacked by feminist 
colleagues, or, more generally, that their comments will be regarded as an 
effort to turn back the clock to the 1950s--a goal that has almost no 
constituency in the academy. Even more fundamental, it has become risky 
for anyone--scholar, politician, religious leader--to make normative 
statements today. This reflects not only the persistent drive toward 
"value neutrality" in the professions but also a deep confusion about the 
purposes of public discourse. The dominant view appears to be that social 
criticism, like criticism of individuals, is psychologically damaging. The 
worst thing you can do is to make people feel guilty or bad about 
themselves. <P>

When one sets aside these constraints, however, the case against the 
two-parent family is remarkably weak. It is true that disaggregating data 
can make family structure less significant as a factor, just as 
disaggregating Hurricane Andrew into wind, rain, and tides can make it 
disappear as a meteorological phenomenon. Nonetheless, research opinion as 
well as common sense suggests that the effects of changes in family 
structure are great enough to cause concern. Nicholas Zill argues that 
many of the risk factors for children are doubled or more than doubled as 
the result of family disruption. "In epidemiological terms," he writes, 
"the doubling of a hazard is a substantial increase. . . . the increase in 
risk that dietary cholesterol poses for cardiovascular disease, for 
example, is far less than double, yet millions of Americans have altered 
their diets because of the perceived hazard."<P>

The argument that family conflict, rather than the breakup of parents, is 
the cause of children's psychological distress is persuasive on its face. 
Children who grow up in high-conflict families, whether the families stay 
together or eventually split up, are undoubtedly at great psychological 
risk. And surely no one would dispute that there must be societal measures 
available, including divorce, to remove children from families where they 
are in danger. Yet only a minority of divorces grow out of pathological 
situations; much more common are divorces in families unscarred by 
physical assault. Moreover, an equally compelling hypothesis is that 
family breakup generates its own conflict. Certainly, many families 
exhibit more conflictual and even violent behavior as a consequence of 
divorce than they did before divorce. <P>

Finally, it is important to note that clinical insights are different from 
sociological findings. Clinicians work with individual families, who 
cannot and should not be defined by statistical aggregates. Appropriate to 
a clinical approach, moreover, is a focus on the internal dynamics of 
family functioning and on the immense variability in human behavior. 
Nevertheless, there is enough empirical evidence to justify sociological 
statements about the causes of declining child well-being and to 
demonstrate that despite the plasticity of human response, there are some 
useful rules of thumb to guide our thinking about and policies affecting 
the family. <P>

For example, Sara McLanahan says, three structural constants are commonly 
associated with intact families, even intact families who would not win 
any "Family of the Year" awards. The first is economic. In intact 
families, children share in the income of two adults. Indeed, as a number 
of analysts have pointed out, the two
parent family is becoming more rather than less necessary, because more 
and more families need two incomes to sustain a middle-class standard of 
living. <P>

McLanahan believes that most intact families also provide a stable 
authority structure. Family breakup commonly upsets the established 
boundaries of authority in a family. Children are often required to make 
decisions or accept responsibilities once considered the province of 
parents. Moreover, children, even very young children, are often expected 
to behave like mature adults, so that the grown-ups in the family can be 
free to deal with the emotional fallout of the failed relationship. In 
some instances family disruption creates a complete vacuum in authority; 
everyone invents his or her own rules. With lines of authority disrupted 
or absent, children find it much more difficult to engage in the normal 
kinds of testing behavior, the trial and error, the failing and 
succeeding, that define the developmental pathway toward character and 
competence. McLanahan says, "Children need to be the ones to challenge the 
rules. The parents need to set the boundaries and let the kids push the 
boundaries. The children shouldn't have to walk the straight and narrow at 
all times."<P>

Finally, McLanahan holds that children in intact families benefit from 
stability in what she neutrally terms "household personnel." Family 
disruption frequently brings new adults into the family, including 
stepparents, live-in boyfriends or girlfriends, and casual sexual 
partners. Like stepfathers, boyfriends can present a real threat to 
children's, particularly to daughters', security and well-being. But 
physical or sexual abuse represents only the most extreme such threat. 
Even the very best of boyfriends can disrupt and undermine a child's sense 
of peace and security, McLanahan says. "It's not as though you're going 
from an unhappy marriage to peacefulness. There can be a constant changing 
until the mother finds a suitable partner." <P>

McLanahan's argument helps explain why children of widows tend to do 
better than children of divorced or unmarried mothers. Widows differ from 
other single mothers in all three respects. They are economically more 
secure, because they receive more public assistance through Survivors 
Insurance, and possibly private insurance or other kinds of support from 
family members. Thus widows are less likely to leave the neighborhood in 
search of a new or better job and a cheaper house or apartment. Moreover, 
the death of a father is not likely to disrupt the authority structure 
radically. When a father dies, he is no longer physically present, but his 
death does not dethrone him as an authority figure in the child's life. On 
the contrary, his authority may be magnified through death. The mother can 
draw on the powerful memory of the departed father as a way of 
intensifying her parental authority: "Your father would have wanted it 
this way." Finally, since widows tend to be older than divorced mothers, 
their love life may be less distracting.<P>

Regarding the two-parent family, the sociologist David Popenoe, who has 
devoted much of his career to the study of families, both in the United 
States and in Scandinavia, makes this straightforward assertion: Social 
science research is almost never conclusive. There are always 
methodological difficulties and stones left unturned. Yet in three decades 
of work as a social scientist, I know of few other bodies of data in which 
the weight of evidence is so decisively on one side of the issue: on the 
whole, for children, two-parent families are preferable to single-parent 
and stepfamilies.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>The Regime Effect</b><P>
<BR>
The rise in family disruption is not unique to American society. It is 
evident in virtually all advanced nations, including Japan, where it is 
also shaped by the growing participation of women in the work force. Yet 
the United States has made divorce easier and quicker than in any other 
Western nation with the sole exception of Sweden--and the trend toward 
solo motherhood has also been more pronounced in America. (Sweden has an 
equally high rate of out-of-wedlock birth, but the majority of such births 
are to cohabiting couples, a long-established pattern in Swedish society.) 
More to the point, nowhere has family breakup been greeted by a more 
triumphant rhetoric of renewal than in America. <P>

What is striking about this rhetoric is how deeply it reflects classic 
themes in American public life. It draws its language and imagery from the 
nation's founding myth. It depicts family breakup as a drama of revolution 
and rebirth. The nuclear family represents the corrupt past, an 
institution guilty of the abuse of power and the suppression of individual 
freedom. Breaking up the family is like breaking away from Old World 
tyranny. Liberated from the bonds of the family, the individual can 
achieve independence and experience a new beginning, a fresh start, a new 
birth of freedom. In short, family breakup recapitulates the American 
experience.<P>

This rhetoric is an example of what the University of Maryland political 
philosopher William Galston has called the "regime effect." The founding 
of the United States set in motion a new political order based to an 
unprecedented degree on individual rights, personal choice, and 
egalitarian relationships. Since then these values have spread beyond 
their original domain of political relationships to define social 
relationships as well. During the past twenty-five years these values have 
had a particularly profound impact on the family.<P>

Increasingly, political principles of individual rights and choice shape 
our understanding of family commitment and solidarity. Family 
relationships are viewed not as permanent or binding but as voluntary and 
easily terminable. Moreover, under the sway of the regime effect the 
family loses its central importance as an institution in the civil 
society, accomplishing certain social goals such as raising children and 
caring for its members, and becomes a means to achieving greater 
individual happiness--a lifestyle choice. Thus, Galston says, what is 
happening to the American family reflects the "unfolding logic of 
authoritative, deeply American moral-political principles." <P>

One benefit of the regime effect is to create greater equality in adult 
family relationships. Husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, enjoy 
relationships far more egalitarian than past relationships were, and most 
Americans prefer it that way. But the political principles of the regime 
effect can threaten another kind of family relationship--that between 
parent and child. Owing to their biological and developmental immaturity, 
children are needy dependents. They are not able to express their choices 
according to limited, easily terminable, voluntary agreements. They are 
not able to act as negotiators in family decisions, even those that most 
affect their own interests. As one writer has put it, "a newborn does not 
make a good 'partner.'" Correspondingly, the parental role is antithetical 
to the spirit of the regime. Parental investment in children involves a 
diminished investment in self, a willing deference to the needs and claims 
of the dependent child. Perhaps more than any other family relationship, 
the parent-child relationship--shaped as it is by patterns of dependency 
and deference--can be undermined and weakened by the principles of the 
regime.<P>

More than a century and a half ago Alexis de Tocqueville made the striking 
observation that an individualistic society depends on a communitarian 
institution like the family for its continued existence. The family cannot 
be constituted like the liberal state, nor can it be governed entirely by 
that state's principles. Yet the family serves as the seedbed for the 
virtues required by a liberal state. The family is responsible for 
teaching lessons of independence, self-restraint, responsibility, and 
right conduct, which are essential to a free, democratic society. If the 
family fails in these tasks, then the entire experiment in democratic 
self-rule is jeopardized.<P>

To take one example: independence is basic to successful functioning in 
American life. We assume that most people in America will be able to work, 
care for themselves and their families, think for themselves, and 
inculcate the same traits of independence and initiative in their 
children. We depend on families to teach people to do these things. The 
erosion of the two-parent family undermines the capacity of families to 
impart this knowledge; children of long-term welfare
dependent single parents are far more likely than others to be dependent 
themselves. Similarly, the children in disrupted families have a harder 
time forging bonds of trust with others and giving and getting help across 
the generations. This, too, may lead to greater dependency on the 
resources of the state.<P>

Over the past two and a half decades Americans have been conducting what 
is tantamount to a vast natural experiment in family life. Many would 
argue that this experiment was necessary, worthwhile, and long overdue. 
The results of the experiment are coming in, and they are clear. Adults 
have benefited from the changes in family life in important ways, but the 
same cannot be said for children. Indeed, this is the first generation in 
the nation's history to do worse psychologically, socially, and 
economically than its parents. Most poignantly, in survey after survey the 
children of broken families confess deep longings for an intact family.<P>

Nonetheless, as Galston is quick to point out, the regime effect is not an 
irresistible undertow that will carry away the family. It is more like a 
swift current, against which it is possible to swim. People learn; 
societies can change, particularly when it becomes apparent that certain 
behaviors damage the social ecology, threaten the public order, and impose 
new burdens on core institutions. Whether Americans will act to overcome 
the legacy of family disruption is a crucial but as yet unanswered 
question.

		ew things frighten a woman more than discovering a lump in one of 

her breasts. With good reason: <a href="http://www.pslgroup.com/

Breastcancer.htm#Other">breast cancer</a> may transform a woman's 

breast into the vehicle of her death. It is twice as likely to be 

diagnosed in an American woman today as it was sixty years ago. And the 

treatment--surgery, usually followed by radiation and 

chemotherapy--is disfiguring, painful, and all too often unsuccessful. <p>

	I have been researching and treating this disease for more than 

thirty-five years, a period in which the public's awareness of breast 

cancer has risen enormously. The disease has brought into being an entire 

industry of research organizations, charitable agencies, commercial 

ventures, and advocacy groups. Every new statistic is trumpeted in the 

media, and every encouraging research finding, no matter how tenuous, is 

held up as a potential breakthrough. <p>

One result of this visibility has been a rise in public sympathy for 

victims of breast cancer and a concomitant rise in funding for 

breast-cancer research. But the growth in awareness has had another, less 

desirable result: a flood of often contradictory information that has led 

to public confusion. Paradoxically, women are both too anxious about their 

chances of developing breast cancer and too hopeful about our current 

approaches to diagnosing and treating the disease. They believe that 

breast cancer is an epidemic and that it is being cured. Unfortunately, 

both these beliefs arise from flawed reasoning--not by women but by 

the medical profession. <p>

Two groups in the health-care profession are involved in the fight against 

cancer--indeed, against any kind of disease. The first works 

principally on the front lines, helping patients understand the therapies 

available and offering insight, treatment, and reassurance whenever 

possible. The second works mostly at scientific institutions, performing 

the methodical, frustratingly slow tasks associated with epidemiology, 

clinical trials, and laboratory analysis. As researchers, the members of 

the second group are necessarily less concerned with the fate of specific 

patients than with understanding specific diseases and whether medicine is 

successfully combating them. To move forward, they must coldly distinguish 

between genuine advances and wishful thinking. I have spent my career as a 

member of the first group, although Ihave also spent years helping to 

conduct and analyze clinical trials. In what follows Ihave adopted the 

researcher's view of the big picture, while also summarizing the risks and 

benefits of the treatments now available to women with breast 

cancer--treatments the clinician in me still recommends and performs, 

though the researcher wonders how often they will be of meaningful help. 

Only by stepping back from the perspective of caring for individual 

patients can one hope to make clear what doctors mean (or should mean)when 

they use such broad words as "epidemic"and "cure."<p><br>

<CENTER><b>IS BREAST CANCER <br>

AN EPIDEMIC?</b><p>

</CENTER>Many of my patients have conflicting images of their breasts. On 

the one hand, breasts are symbols of beauty, sexuality, and nurturing; on 

the other, they are troublesome organs that are increasingly likely to 

threaten women's lives. In the United States the likelihood that a woman 

will be found to have breast cancer has slowly and inexorably mounted 

since the 1930s, when some systematic data collection began. The increase 

in diagnoses, already a cause for concern, accelerated in the 1980s, 

growing by a rate of four percent a year. This year, according to the <a 

href="http://www.cancer.org/"> 

American Cancer Society</a>, some 184,300 women will discover that they have 

the disease; another 44,300 will die of it. Of the women in whom cancer is 

diagnosed, 9,200 will not yet be forty--nearly twice the number of 

women under forty who were found to have breast cancer in 1970. The 

disease is now the leading cause of death for American women aged forty to 

fifty-five, and causes women to lose more years of productive life than 

any other disease. Numbers like these are why breast cancer is often 

called an epidemic. <p>

To our grandparents, this picture would have seemed amazing. At the turn 

of the century cancer of the breast was a relatively unusual disease. What 

happened? Why does the incidence of breast cancer seem so much higher 

today? <p>

Some of the increase is more apparent than real. Because women today are 

less likely to die young in childbirth or of infectious disease, they live 

long enough to develop diseases of middle and old age, breast cancer among 

them. And the recent jump in the number of breast-cancer victims under 

fifty is almost wholly due to the concurrent jump in the number of women 

in that age group, caused by the Baby Boom. A third reason for the 

increase in diagnoses of breast cancer is the growing use of <a href="

http://vh.radiology.uiowa.edu/Patients/PatientDept/RadiologyBrochures/

Mammography/MamXRay.html"> mammography</a>, 

a technique that uses x-rays to examine the breast. With mammography 

doctors catch many cancer cases earlier than they otherwise would 

have--and some cases that would never have been caught at all. The 

technique surged in popularity in the 1980s, and accounts for much of the 

recent spurt in diagnoses. (Now that mammography is routine, the rate of 

increase in diagnoses has slowed.)<p>

At the same time, most experts in medical statistics believe that these 

factors do not explain <I>all</I> of the rise. Even when greater 

longevity, the population bulge, and the introduction of mammography are 

taken into account, a real, underlying increase remains. Minus those three 

factors, the chance that a woman will be found to have breast cancer has 

been growing steadily for decades, at roughly one percent a year. <p>

What lies behind this rise? Although there is not enough evidence to say 

with certainty, an increasing number of observers have come to believe 

that the emergence of breast cancer as a widespread health problem is tied 

to the extraordinary transformations in women's lives. Coupled with better 

nutrition, the expansion of opportunities for women, especially in the 

industrialized West, altered not only women's lives but also their bodies, 

and especially their cycles of reproductive hormones--apparently 

making them more susceptible to certain cancers. <p>

For most of human history menarche, the age of first menstruation, usually 

occurred in the late teens. (This is one reason that previous generations 

saw less early-teenage pregnancy--fewer adolescents were 

physiologically capable of having babies.) Once fecund, women of past 

millennia quickly became pregnant with the first of perhaps half a dozen 

children, each of whom they breast-fed for an extended period--a 

practice that regularly stops the menstrual cycle. If they survived to 

their mid-thirties, they were aged in appearance and probably 

post-menopausal; their brutal living conditions usually did not permit 

them to live much longer. Late menarche, multiple pregnancies, long 

nursing times, early menopause--all these combined to make women of 

the past menstruate much less often than their modern counterparts. Many 

women in the past may have ovulated only twenty times in their entire 

lives. <p>

This grim picture changed only recently. Not until modern times has a 

large percentage of humankind been able to obtain a continuous supply of 

nutritious food and potable water or been able to control infectious 

disease. The average age of menarche has fallen to twelve in Western 

industrialized nations. Meanwhile, the age of first marriage has risen. 

According to the <a href="http://www.census.gov/"> U.S. Census Bureau</a>, it 

now averages twenty-four for women 

in this country; many educated and affluent women do not marry until their 

thirties, partly because of the increased opportunities to have careers 

outside the home. Pregnancy, too, has become much less common, as lost 

working time drives up the cost of having babies. Marriages produce an 

average of two children, which women nurse briefly if at all. And <a href=

"http://www.pslgroup.com/Menopause.htm">

menopause</a> does not occur until age fifty or later. Women today are thus 

exposed to reproductive hormones over a much longer span than in the past. 

They may have 300 to 400 periods--fifteen to twenty times as many as 

their ancestors had, exposing their breasts to historically unprecedented 

numbers of estrogen-progesterone cycles. <p>

Estrogen and progesterone, like aspirin, have such familiar-sounding names 

that people often don't realize how powerful their effects are. Among 

these effects is the multiplication of cells within the breast. With 

repeated menstrual cycles that are rarely interrupted by full-term 

pregnancy, the number of cells in some parts of the breast can increase by 

a factor of a hundred or even more. If only because of the simple increase 

in number, this constantly repeated cellular multiplication is believed to 

increase the likelihood of genetic accidents. Most cancers are believed to 

arise from such accidents, and so the strong suspicion is that repeated 

menstruation is a precursor to cancer of the breast. <p>

If the improvements in women's lives have indirectly promoted breast 

cancer, then it is unhelpful to call the growth in its incidence an 

epidemic. In medical terms an epidemic is the sudden outbreak of a 

generally rare condition, such as the deadly spread of cholera in a city 

with contaminated water, and should be stopped by striking at its 

source--in this example the contaminated water. The "epidemic" of 

breast cancer, in contrast, may be an unwanted accompaniment to what most 

Americans view as social and material progress. If this suspicion is true, 

it is obviously unacceptable to eliminate the epidemic's cause. <p>

Equally important, the increase in breast cancer does not resemble other 

epidemics. Although the likelihood that a woman will be found to have the 

disease has climbed, the likelihood that it will end her life has not. 

After adjustments for today's longer life-span and the population bulge 

associated with the Baby Boom, the proportion of women who are killed 

every year by breast cancer--24.7 to 27.6 per 100,000 --has 

remained little changed since the 1930s. Women face an ever-increasing 

risk of being discovered to have breast cancer, then--but not of dying 

from it. It is highly unusual, to say the least, for a nationwide epidemic 

of a fatal disease not to affect the death rate.<p>

This odd and even paradoxical situation has sown much confusion and fear. 

Breast cancer is a major public-health concern; it kills 0.04 percent of 

all American women yearly. But it is important for women to recognize that 

other conditions, especially the various forms of cardiovascular disease 

and, for smokers, lung cancer, are much more likely to claim their lives. 

Unfortunately, the enormous publicity accorded the rise in breast-cancer 

incidence has obscured the fact that the disease is not the leading killer 

of women. Also, the publicity usually obscures the fact that the majority 

of women who die of the disease are elderly. In a survey conducted by 

three researchers at the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/dms/cecs/">

Dartmouth Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences</a> and published in

May of last year in the <a href="http://wwwicic.nci.nih.gov/jnci/

jnci_issues.html"><I>Journal of the 

National Cancer Institute</I></a>, the median estimate female Baby Boomers 

gave of their chance of dying of breast cancer within a decade was 10 

percent. A substantial minority thought the risk was 30 percent or more. 

In fact, the likelihood that a woman in her forties will die of breast 

cancer in the next ten years of her life is on the order of 0.4 percent. 

<p>

In my view, the medical profession, too, has lost perspective. If a 

woman's chances of dying of breast cancer are little changed despite a 

huge rise in the incidence of the disease, there are two possible 

explanations. First, we could be making progress. To go on from the 

current hypothesis: as women's changing hormonal environment slowly drove 

up the number of breast-cancer cases, our mastery of the disease could 

have grown at such a rate that, year after year, the increase in cures 

precisely canceled out the increase in incidence, leaving the overall 

death rate unaffected. When my colleagues claim that we are curing breast 

cancer, they are implicitly endorsing this view. And why not? When 

physicians treat more cases of a disease while observing the same number 

of deaths, that means a smaller percentage of their patients are dying.<p>

The second possible explanation is that the change in women's hormonal 

environment is creating a surge in slow-growing, less-aggressive forms of 

breast cancer. Because this "new" breast cancer, if it is indeed 

responsible for the rise in diagnosed cases, is a much less dangerous 

disease than the breast cancer that was found before, in many cases it 

would not need treatment beyond excising the primary tumor. The rise in 

incidence would not be matched by a rise in breast-cancer mortality, 

because women would die first of other causes. The apparent good news 

about the decline in the proportion of fatal cases would in fact be 

masking the unchanged prevalence of the "old" breast cancer: a persistent 

public-health problem that is just as likely to kill women now as it was 

sixty years ago. I believe this is just what we are seeing.<P><br>

<CENTER><b>BREAST-CANCER <br>

BASICS </b><p>

</CENTER>Female breasts are one of the most variable parts of the human 

anatomy. Evolved from sweat glands, they are designed to provide milk for 

infants through a system of ducts and lobules. The ducts are small tubes 

that run several inches back from the nipple to the milk-producing 

lobules, which stick out from the ducts like clusters of tiny grapes. Both 

are enveloped by fat and connective tissue, which are contained within a 

sac of skin shaped roughly like a teardrop. The whole assembly changes 

dramatically in size, shape, and constitution during the menstrual cycle, 

pregnancy, breast-feeding, and menopause. Not only do breasts vary from 

woman to woman but each woman's breasts continue to change throughout her 

life. <p>

At any given time a third to a half of all Western women have some kind of 

breast problem, although most are not particularly concerned about the 

symptoms--nor need they be. The symptoms frequently include swelling 

and aching before menstrual flow; women may feel their breasts engorge and 

grow tender. If their breasts become lumpier, however, this may be owing 

to cysts--fluid-filled balloon-like sacs within the breast. Or the 

lumps may be solid, nodular clumps of overgrown breast-duct cells, known 

generically to doctors as mammary dysplasia or , the most widely used 

term, fibrocystic disease. These conditions are benign--a term doctors 

use to mean "not cancerous." ("Benign" does not mean "not painful" or "not 

harmful." Many benign conditions should be treated.) <p>

If much of the breast is palpably lumpy, as is often the case, the 

diagnosis is usually "benign." Matters are less clear when the problem is 

in a small area: "dominant mass" is the term used by most doctors for a 

swelling that stands out sharply. In such a case a biopsy is almost 

routinely recommended. Sometimes the biopsy involves nothing more than 

extracting a sample from the breast with a needle, but the surgeon may 

also remove the entire lump. Afterward, the tissue is examined in a 

laboratory. Most of the time the news is reassuring; two thirds to four 

fifths of all biopsies reveal that the abnormality is not malignant. 

(Women in their forties are more likely than older women to have negative 

biopsies, because mammograms of their naturally lumpier breasts are harder 

to interpret.)Yet the specter of breast cancer remains--many of these 

"benign" conditions are statistically linked with the disease. <p>

Breast cancer is as diverse as the breast itself, appearing in many 

different guises. Some cancers seem to erupt out of ordinary breast tissue 

with an awesome virulence, spreading rapidly throughout the body. When 

viewed under a microscope, the cells in these cancers almost always bear 

no resemblance to ordinary duct or lobule cells--they have lost all 

the specialized characteristics that differentiate cells in the breast 

from cells in other parts of the body. "Poorly differentiated" 

malignancies, as pathologists refer to them, are usually bad news, no 

matter what we bring to bear therapeutically.  <p>

Fortunately, these poorly differentiated, clinically virulent cancers are 

relatively uncommon. Much more often--perhaps in half of all 

breast-cancer cases--pathologists see malignancies that still bear 

some of the characteristics of normal breast tissue. These "moderately 

differentiated" tumors have a wide range of outcomes, though the prognosis 

for the patient is generally more favorable. A substantial number of women 

with moderately differentiated tumors will survive for years after 

treatment--even decades. In most cases these tumors evolve more slowly 

than their poorly differentiated cousins, probably taking years to become 

detectable. "Well-differentiated" tumors, a less common form, are more 

indolent still. Indeed, pathologists sometimes have trouble ascertaining 

whether they are truly malignant; women have a good chance of surviving 

them.<p>

In recent years doctors have increasingly encountered a fourth, somewhat 

different type of breast tumor: <a href="http://www.cancer.org/facts.html">

<I>in situ</I></a>  cancer. Twenty years ago <I>in situ</I> tumors made up

 no more than one or two percent of all 

breast-cancer cases. Today the figure is 10 percent or more, a five- to 

ten-fold increase. <I>In situ</I> tumors are usually small--half an 

inch or less across--and confined to the ducts and lobules of the 

breast. When diagnosed, these tumors usually appear not to have invaded 

the connective tissue or spread elsewhere in the body; like 

well-differentiated tumors, <I>in situ</I> tumors are not likely to be 

fatal.<p>

I must caution that breast-cancer characterization remains an inexact 

science. The categories themselves are fuzzy. Well-differentiated and 

<I>in situ</I> tumors can occasionally grow fast and develop into serious, 

even fatal, disease; some poorly differentiated tumors respond amazingly 

well to treatment. The uncertainty is partly due to a lack of absolute 

procedures for distinguishing among the three classifications. Often a 

tumor is classified as poorly differentiated by one pathologist and 

moderately differentiated by another. Neither doctor could be accused of 

making a mistake.<p>

More important, the degree of differentiation does not by itself describe 

the malevolence of a tumor. It is important to know too if the tumor cells 

respond to estrogen and progesterone--that is, whether they retain the 

biochemical equipment to link up physically with molecules of these 

hormones. (Given the apparent role of hormones in promoting the disease, 

their significance in its outcome is unsurprising.) Up to two thirds of 

all breast tumors have enough sensitivity to reproductive hormones to be, 

in the jargon, estrogen- or progesterone-receptor-positive; such tumors 

tend to grow relatively slowly and can be treated by modifying a woman's 

hormonal environment, either with drugs or (rarely) by removing the 

ovaries. Estrogen- or progesterone-receptor-negative tumors generally have 

poorer outcomes. <p>

Even when such complicating factors are considered, though, the tumor's 

degree of differentiation is a reasonably accurate approximation of its 

virulence. The less resemblance cancer cells bear to the tissue that 

spawned them, the worse the prognosis for the patient.<p>

Notwithstanding the myriad forms in which breast cancer presents itself, 

researchers believe that at a fundamental level all breast cancers are 

similar. In their view, breast cancer, like other cancers, is the result 

of accidental changes in the genetic makeup of a cell--mutations. When 

the cell reproduces, it passes on its altered DNA. It begins to reproduce 

independently, regardless of the body's needs--the defining 

characteristic of cancer. Cells depend on nutrients and oxygen from the 

bloodstream. Under ordinary circumstances aberrant, independently growing 

cells would outpace the available blood supply by the time they had formed 

a blob of tissue one or two millimeters in diameter; they would then die 

from a lack of oxygen and food. Instead cancer cells--by means that 

remain frustratingly unclear--create their own network of blood 

vessels to secure necessary nutrients. Once this circulatory system is 

established, the nascent tumor can continue to grow at its own pace. 

Eventually a discrete mass of aberrant cells becomes identifiable, either 

as a denser area on a mammogram or as a lump detectable by touch. <p>

As the cancer progresses, it can invade the surrounding tissue and spread 

throughout the body in the familiar and frightening process known as 

metastasis. Metastasis is almost always how breast cancer kills its 

victims. Left untreated, as it generally was in previous centuries, the 

original, or primary, tumor usually grows very large, sometimes to the 

size of a grapefruit. Eventually it begins to outstrip its self-generated 

blood supply; portions of the tumor die, leading to ulceration of the 

breast surface and eventual death from infection, hemorrhage, or both. 

Today this peril is avoided with relative ease by removing the tumor. The 

metastases are quite another problem. As it grows, the primary tumor sheds 

cancer cells into its self-generated network of blood vessels. Spreading 

through the body, these cells can lodge in almost any vital organ, 

creating a second tumor--or a third, or a fourth. Like the primary 

tumor, the new tumors create their own blood supply, each one siphoning 

off nutrients from the body to feed its expansion. When the metastases 

reach an appreciable aggregate size--a total tumor load of two pounds 

or so, scattered throughout the body--the struggle for life is usually 

over.<p>

From an intellectual point of view, metastasis is an amazing phenomenon. 

If a surgeon inserted a microscopic clump of normal cells from a woman's 

breast into another organ, the body's defense systems would wipe out the 

misplaced normal cells almost instantly. Yet cancer cells that split off 

from the main tumor and lodge elsewhere in the body not only survive but 

can grow exuberantly. For this reason most doctors believe that the best 

method for stopping breast cancer is to detect it before it has spread. 

Find the problem while it is still small and isolated--that is the 

hope. <p>

The best method for early clinical detection of breast cancer is 

mammography. The American Cancer Society advises women aged forty to 

forty-nine to have mammograms every one to two years, and women aged fifty 

and over to have them annually. Women with any potential cancer symptoms, 

such as suspicious lumpiness of the breast, should see their doctor 

immediately.  <p>

We have been trying to treat breast cancer aggressively for decades. Many 

physicians now believe that the long effort to detect and control this 

disease is meeting with success. I shall argue otherwise. Despite the 

hopes pinned on mammography, it has had little impact on women's 

health--indeed, it may have had none. And although we have taken some 

important steps forward in our treatment of breast cancer once it has been 

diagnosed--steps that can add years to a woman's life--we are 

still far from curing the disease.<P><br>

<CENTER><b>DOES <br>

MAMMOGRAPHY HELP?</b><p>

</CENTER>Finding breast cancer as early as possible seems to be a great 

idea, like trying to diagnose high blood pressure before it damages the 

heart or the kidneys. And mammograms can occasionally detect tumors as 

small as an eighth of an inch across, whereas the lower limit for tumors 

diagnosable by palpation (examining the breast manually) is about half an 

inch across. Yet one would like to be sure that this difference actually 

translates into a higher likelihood that treatment will be successful. An 

official nationwide mammography program would be a huge commitment: 51.5 

million American women are aged forty or above. And one must bear in mind 

the cost of needless medical procedures generated by the huge number of 

false-positive mammograms--two to four false positives for every true 

positive, according to some measures. (A false positive shows a mass or 

lump that proves after further testing not to be cancerous.)We continue to 

consider creating a national screening program, but I believe it has never 

been proved that such a program would, on balance, be beneficial--even 

if it served the secondary purpose of bringing into the health-care system 

women who otherwise could not afford it or would not see a doctor 

frequently.<p>

To prove the value of mammography scientifically is more difficult than it 

might seem. In some studies investigators ask women to volunteer for 

screening, and then report the number of breast-cancer cases and the 

percentage of women who survive five years after diagnosis. This figure is 

compared with the percentage in the population at large. In these studies 

researchers often go to considerable trouble to eliminate potential 

sources of confusion. For example, they may try to match by age the women 

undergoing regular mammography with other women. Or they may match by race 

or socioeconomic class. No matter how hard researchers try, though, such 

studies remain susceptible to three of the most common sources of bias in 

medical research. <p>

Mammography may find a tumor as early as two years before it could have 

been detected by palpation. Let us, however, consider a hypothetical case 

in which the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body by the 

time it is discovered, and the woman goes to her grave on exactly the same 

day she would have if the tumor had been discovered later. In that case 

the sole effect of early detection has been to stretch out the time in 

which the woman bears the knowledge of her condition. But that is not how 

the woman would appear statistically if she had happened to become part of 

a research study. Pushing back the date of first diagnosis would increase 

the interval between diagnosis and death, apparently lengthening her 

survival. Statisticians call this effect "lead-time bias." Although 

nothing has actually changed, a woman who would have died, say, three 

years after treatment now dies five to six years after 

treatment--manufacturing an apparent victory for medicine. <p>

A second problem with measuring the benefits of mammography is known as 

"length bias." Women typically have mammograms every year or every other 

year. Any cancers that are found between mammograms will be detected by 

palpation--very possibly by the woman herself. Such tumors are likely 

to be fast-growing; indeed, their rapid onset often explains why they were 

not picked up by the previous mammogram. The more aggressive tumors tend 

not to be diagnosed mammographically, and thus the tumors that are 

discovered by mammograms are often less dangerous. Mammography will be 

made to look good in a study comparing the survival rate of women whose 

tumors were diagnosed by mammography with that of women whose tumors were 

diagnosed by palpation, because the tumors discovered by mammography tend 

to be those that grow relatively slowly and thus take longer to kill 

patients. <p>

The third and most important problem is "selection bias." This occurs when 

researchers measure the effect of a treatment on a group of people without 

realizing that those people are different from the general population. The 

risks that selection bias will occur are high, because women who 

participate in medical experiments are often not like the general 

population. Researchers typically work in teaching hospitals and thus draw 

their subjects from the patients who frequent them. These people may be 

more affluent than most Americans, and thus more prone to diseases of 

affluence. Or they may be more worried about their health, and thus more 

likely to seek expert medical care. In either case, the results of a test 

on such a select group can be misleading. <p>

Many researchers agree that lead-time, length, and selection biases may 

flaw the optimistic accounts of the efficacy of mammography that have 

appeared in the scientific press and the popular media. Nonetheless, they 

support the idea of routinely screening women. The principal reason is 

that benefits from mammography have been observed in a special kind of 

study known as a prospective randomized clinical trial. In such a trial 

researchers randomly divide large numbers of volunteers into two groups at 

the outset (prospectively): a control group, which receives ordinary 

medical care; and a test group, which receives the medication or procedure 

under scrutiny. After a given period of time the two groups are compared. 

Properly conducted, such trials avoid all three kinds of bias. Even 

prospective randomized clinical trials have their pitfalls, though, 

because doctors can't control the actions of their patients. Members of 

the test group may fail to take their medicine or to show up for their 

medical procedures, and members of the control group may seek out a drug 

or procedure they are not supposed to have. As hard as researchers may try 

to ascertain levels of compliance, misclassification of a certain number 

of participants is inevitable. In addition, the medical care provided at  

research centers, which often conduct clinical trials, may not be 

representative of the care received by most people.<p>

Nonetheless, by ensuring from the beginning that the test group and the 

control group are statistically similar and by tracking everyone in both 

groups, these trials can produce data that are as solid as medical 

research gets. And several big prospective randomized clinical trials have 

reported that women who regularly undergo mammography have, roughly 

speaking, 25 to 30 percent less chance of dying from breast cancer in the 

decade after initial screening than women who are not screened. Most 

breast-cancer specialists thus endorse mammography. <p>

In fact the evidence from these trials is weaker than it sounds. In April 

of last year an article in <I>Cancer</I> summarized all eight of the major 

mammography trials that have been conducted to date. Six of the trials saw 

no significant decreases in breast-cancer mortality as a result of 

mammography. "Significant," an important term, means that statistical 

tests indicate that the effect is probably not due to chance. Also, the 

two significant clinical trials were the first ones completed. "Should the 

early trials be accepted as the gold standard and the later ones dismissed 

as somehow incompetent?" Charles J. Wright, of the University of British 

Columbia, and C. Barber Mueller, of McMaster University, asked in <I>The 

Lancet </I>last July. "Surely not, in view of the increasing rigour of 

trial design over the past 30 years and the vast improvement in quality of 

mammography." Indeed, the two earliest trials have serious potential 

shortcomings. Explaining these shortcomings involves delving still further 

into technical details; some readers may wish to skip the next section of 

this article entirely. The gist of my argument is that the benefits of 

frequent mammography as opposed to palpation performed during regular 

checkups and also by a woman herself are not well established; if they do 

exist, they are not as great as many women hope. <P><br>

<CENTER><b>STATISTICAL <br>

TROUBLES</b><p>

</CENTER>The more important historically of the two trials that showed 

significant benefits is known as the HIP trial, after the Health Insurance 

Plan of Greater New York, the health-maintenance organization from which 

the researchers gathered participants. A classic of medical research, the 

HIP trial enrolled 60,696 patients from 1963 to 1966 and followed them for 

as long as eighteen years. In 1988 two of its principal investigators, Sam 

Shapiro and Philip Strax, won the Charles F. Kettering Prize for 

outstanding cancer research, both because the trial was one of the 

earliest large-scale attempts to test a preventive health measure and 

because it showed that periodic mammography reduced breast-cancer 

mortality by 30 percent over a ten-year period.<p>

Notwithstanding the accolades awarded to this pioneering effort, it 

suffered from methodological weaknesses. In clinical trials, as I have 

said, the subjects should be randomly distributed between the test group 

(in this case women who received annual mammograms and clinical breast 

examinations) and the control group (women who received ordinary medical 

care from their own doctors). Experimenters always fear that they may 

introduce bias by inadvertently including or excluding the wrong people. 

The HIP trial demonstrates why they worry. <p>

In this experiment the researchers assigned women to the test and control 

groups alternately in order of enlisting, a process intended to produce 

groups of equal size and composition. After assigning a woman to the test 

group the researchers made two simple determinations: Was she pregnant? 

Had she had breast cancer?If the answer to either of these was yes, 

Shapiro and Strax made the woman ineligible for the test group. They did 

not, of course, want to x-ray pregnant women. Nor did they think it a good 

idea to include women with breast cancer, because administering mammograms 

to women who had already been treated for the disease would not be a 

proper test of mammography for the purposes of the study. The test group 

of 30,131 women thus wound up with 434 fewer subjects than the control 

group of 30,565 women. <p>

Shapiro and Strax gave the women in the test group annual mammograms and 

breast examinations for as long as five years. They then counted up the 

number in each group who died of breast cancer within ten years and 

compared the two figures. Because 147 died in the test group and 193 died 

in the control group, Shapiro and Strax concluded that mammography was 

beneficial. But was it?The researchers themselves attributed the "higher 

proportion"of the benefit, at least in the first five years, to clinical 

breast examination--that is, palpation. In order to be certain that 

the remaining benefit was due to mammography, one would have to confirm 

that excluding from the test group the 434 women who either were pregnant 

or had had breast cancer did not skew the results. <p>

The ages of the women in the HIP study ranged from forty to sixty-four. 

Because few women in this age range are pregnant, most of the subjects 

excluded from the test group were surely dropped for having had breast 

cancer. In order to guarantee that the test and control groups were 

identical, the investigators would also have had to identify and exclude 

all the women in the control group who had breast cancer when the 

experiment began, by asking the same two questions they had asked women 

assigned to the test group. But they did not do this--they simply 

filed the names of the women in the control group, without performing any 

initial evaluation. (This was not unusual for control groups of the time.) 

As the trial progressed, the team leaders later wrote, women in the 

control group who "were identified through other sources as having had 

breast cancer diagnosed before their entry dates . . . were dropped from 

the investigation."In other words, the researchers tracked them by looking 

for their names in medical records, insurance claims, and death records; 

if they found evidence that breast cancer had been diagnosed in a member 

of the control group prior to 1963, when the study began, the scientists 

retroactively dropped her from the study. This meant that the researchers 

sometimes had to ascertain the time of diagnosis by finding very old 

records in scattered hospitals or asking family members about events many 

years in the past. <p>

For my own research I have attempted to document medical histories, and 

can report that it is no easy task. Records disappear; memories are 

faulty; people move. More than half the subjects in the HIP study left 

that health-maintenance organization within fifteen years. (In one trial I 

myself inadvertently transmitted incorrect data to its statistical 

administrators: I reported that a deceased patient was alive, because a 

busy doctor's office taking part in the trial was unaware of the death. 

When this omission was discovered, I asked the <a href="http://wwwicic.nci.

nih.gov/">National Cancer Institute</a>

to examine the body of research data Ihad supervised, and I was cleared of 

any wrongdoing.) In my experience people typically underestimate the time 

that has elapsed since a trip to the hospital. Informed of the real date, 

they say, "That long ago? I can't believe that much time has gone by!" In 

those instances when Shapiro and Strax relied on the memories of patients 

and relatives, they almost certainly retained in the control group some 

cancer cases that had actually been diagnosed <I>before </I>the trial 

began--inadvertently stacking the deck in favor of mammography. <p>

A few such slips would be enough to throw off the entire experiment. 

Indeed, if it turned out that Shapiro and Strax had ascribed a mistakenly 

late date of diagnosis to as few as twenty-five women in the control 

group, the failure to exclude them, too, would have changed the study's 

conclusions. Correcting for it would cause the benefit of mammography to 

lose statistical significance--the touchstone of medical research. 

Twenty-five errors is in this case not a big number; it is equivalent to 

about six percent of the 434 patients excluded from the test group. To be 

sure, the trial may have been error-free; although they had not initially 

excluded from the control group women who had had breast cancer, Shapiro 

and Strax wrote that "confidence is warranted" that by the trial's end 

they had identified prior breast-cancer cases equally well in both groups. 

Still, the vulnerability of the conclusions to such a small error is 

troubling. <p>

No such methodological worries seem to afflict the second of the trials to 

show a statistically significant advantage from mammography: the 

Kopparberg study, named after the county in southern Sweden where it took 

place. Beginning in 1977 the Kopparberg trial offered mammography to a 

test group of 38,562 women and ordinary medical care to a control group of 

18,478 women. At the same time, the researchers performed a second big 

trial in another Swedish county. The test group in Kopparberg experienced 

a statistically significant reduction in breast-cancer mortality of 40 

percent; the mortality reduction in the test group in the other county was 

statistically insignificant. <p>

Strangely, though, as the researchers acknowledged, the mortality from all 

causes in the two test groups was "identical" to that in the control 

groups. In 1988 the late Petr Skrabanek, of Trinity College, Dublin, 

pointed out in the <a href="http://www.bmj.com/bmj/"><I>British Medical

 Journal</I></a>, "Not a single life was 

'saved' in a trial that included over 130,000 women" in both counties. The 

women who underwent mammography may have died less frequently of cancer, 

but the gain was offset by deaths from other causes, such as heart attack. 

Presumably the "extra" deaths reflect the workings of chance. But it is 

awkward to argue that a decrease in cancer deaths in the treatment groups 

is meaningful while claiming that an equally great increase in deaths from 

other causes is a fluke. <p>

One of the most recent clinical trials discussed in the <I>Cancer 

</I>article took place in Canada, where a team of physicians gave annual 

mammograms to 44,925 women and ordinary medical care to 44,910 women. The 

researchers enrolled women in the trial from 1980 to 1985 and followed 

their progress for a minimum of seven years. The subjects were divided by 

age into two subgroups: those who were forty to forty-nine when they 

entered the trial, and those who were fifty to fifty-nine. In neither 

subgroup was there an overall difference in mortality from breast cancer 

between the treatment and control groups--mammography had no effect. 

<p>

Mammography supporters immediately dismissed these negative results as 

obvious signs of faulty equipment, poor training, or flawed experimental 

technique. Typical was the reaction of Charles R. Smart, then the director 

of the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control at the National Cancer 

Institute. Without presenting any supporting evidence, Smart dismissed a 

preliminary report from the Canadian researchers by writing in the journal 

<I>Cancer Prevention, </I>in 1990, "The lack of a decrease in mortality 

[in older women] suggests problems in the quality of the mammography in 

this trial." <p>

Others took the Canadian trial more seriously. In a series of steps that 

sowed confusion in many women, the National Cancer Institute and the 

American Cancer Society reviewed all the available evidence about 

mammography, especially for younger women. In October of 1993 the NCI 

reported that mammography provided no certain benefit to women under fifty 

but some benefit to their elders. The American Cancer Society continued to 

endorse routine mammography for all women over forty. The dispute sparked 

by the inability of the Canadian study to find any benefit from routine 

mammography became bitter and personal. Angry critiques poured into the 

journals, and the Canadian researchers defended themselves with equal 

vigor. Contradictory editorials abounded. <p>

The attacks and counterattacks clearly demonstrated how hard it has been 

to prove unequivocally that mammography has a strong beneficial effect on 

women's lives. Trying to resolve the controversy, several research teams 

employed a technique called meta-analysis. Roughly speaking, meta-analysis 

involves adding together the data from many clinical trials to create a 

single pool of data big enough to eliminate much of the statistical 

uncertainty that plagues individual trials. It is accomplished by 

gathering all available studies and comparing them one at a time with the 

"null hypothesis"--in this case the hypothesis that mammography has no 

impact whatever on mortality from breast cancer. If the null hypothesis is 

true, the series of comparisons should randomly differ from zero; added 

together, the chance variations will cancel one another out. If the 

studies consistently find an impact, the comparisons will draw the total 

away from the null hypothesis and toward the actual effect. The great 

virtue of meta-analysis is that clear findings can emerge from a group of 

studies whose findings are scattered all over the map. <p>

In January of last year a team led by Karla Kerlikowse, of the University 

of California at San Francisco, published in the <a href="http://www.ama-assn.

org/journals/"><I>Journal of the 

American Medical Association</I></a> the results of a meta-analysis of the 

eight trials: mammography reduces the seven-to-nine-year mortality from 

breast cancer in women aged fifty to seventy-four by about 23 percent, but 

it has no impact on women in their forties. A second meta-analysis of 

mammography for women in their forties appeared three months later in 

<I>Cancer</I> (the summary referred to above; its authors included Charles 

R. Smart, now retired). Including somewhat more recent data from the same 

trials, with an average follow-up time of 10.4 years, the <I>Cancer</I> 

article concluded that mammography in fact lowered the rate of mortality 

from breast cancer in women aged forty to forty-nine by about 16 percent. 

Indeed, these researchers argued, the true benefit was likely to be 

greater than that. First, the technology of mammograms is constantly 

improving. Second, not all the women in the groups scheduled to receive 

mammograms actually showed up for their examinations. Finally, Smart and 

his associates presented an argument for eliminating from consideration 

the results of the Canadian trial, because it had what they regarded as 

worrisome problems. For instance, almost four times as many advanced 

cancers were diagnosed in the women who had mammograms as in the women in 

the control group--a disproportionately high number of very dangerous 

tumors, which in the critics' view makes the experiment unrepresentative. 

If data from the Canadian trial were discarded, the researchers 

calculated, mammography would lower the rate of mortality from breast 

cancer for women in their forties by 24 percent.<p>

Do the meta-analyses settle the matter? Yes and no. Even if one accepts 

the highest values from these overviews for the risk reduction associated 

with mammography--23 percent for women over fifty, 24 percent for 

women in their forties--the figures do not mean what people think when 

they read headlines about them. The percentages refer to the <I>relative 

</I>risk reduction--a statistical measurement calculated by dividing 

the difference between the risks in the test and control groups by the 

risk in the test group. For example, if a clinical trial shows that a 

treatment cuts the risk of dying from a disease from 70 percent in the 

control group to 50 percent in the test group, the relative risk reduction 

is 70 minus 50, or 20, divided by 50, which works out to 40 percent. This 

percentage sounds large, and it is of great import to medical researchers. 

But it has little to do with the question of interest to individual 

women--the <I>absolute </I> difference in risk between those who are 

screened and those who are not. Using the example I just gave, that 

difference would be 20 percent--half the relative risk reduction. In 

other words, the figure from the meta-analysis is the answer to the 

question "Given that I have breast cancer, how much will I have cut my 

risk of dying if the tumor was detected mammographically?" It is not the 

answer to the question "If I am a typical woman, how much will I cut my 

risk of dying from breast cancer by having an annual mammogram?" <p>

Unfortunately, in this case the absolute reduction is much smaller than 

the relative reduction. According to a rough calculation described by 

Russell Harris and Linda Leininger, of the University of North Carolina at 

Chapel Hill, in the <I>Annals of Internal Medicine </I> in April of last 

year, annual mammographic screening for 10,000 women aged fifty to seventy 

will extend the lives of only two to six of them each year. ("The many 

must be screened to benefit the few," Harris and Leininger remarked.) For 

younger women, they argued, the benefit is even more meager: annual 

screening of 10,000 women in their forties will extend the lives of just 

one or two a year. As Harris and Leininger observed, "the use of the term 

'marginal' to describe this risk reduction seems justified." <p>

Even this small benefit may be more apparent than real. Almost all 

breast-cancer experts agree that mammography, which can diagnose smaller 

tumors, picks up some slow-growing cases of cancer that might otherwise 

never be caught. If these tumors grow sufficiently slowly, they will 

rarely become dangerous in a patient's lifetime. Discovering them will 

thus manufacture an apparent excess of "cures." Because we will detect the 

same number of big, dangerous, fast-growing tumors, the "cures" of 

slow-growing cancers will appear statistically only a number of years 

after diagnosis. Even if mammography had no actual effect on mortality, it 

would still produce a small statistical increase in survival many years 

down the pike. In a clinical trial the test group, with its frequent 

examination by mammography, would have a greater number of less-dangerous 

cancers diagnosed within it than would the control group--a form of 

length bias that would lead predictably to the modest prophylactic effect 

observed in the meta-analyses. <p>

Society should ensure that this effect is worth the cost of obtaining it, 

which includes both the direct cost of mammography itself and the indirect 

cost of biopsies, laboratory analyses, and the time women must take off 

from work for checkups. (The emotional costs of the huge number of false 

positives are substantial too, but cannot be reckoned by this kind of 

accounting.) Charles Wright and C. Barber Mueller calculated in their 

<I>Lancet </I>article what they called a "low" estimate for the cost of 

mammography: $1.2 million for each woman benefited. Two previous 

cost-benefit analyses, they noted, produced comparable figures.<p>

Now contrast the cost of mammography with that of another widely used 

cancer-screening technique: the Pap smear for cervical cancer. Named after 

George Papanicolaou, the physician who developed it in the 1930s, the test 

is less expensive than mammography, simpler to perform, and far more 

reliable. Because the Pap smear can detect cervical cancer in its long 

latent stage, before the cancer invades surrounding tissue, the test is 

widely believed to reduce the mortality of invasive cervical cancer by 90 

percent. According to a study published in 1990 in the <I>Annals of 

Internal Medicine </I>by David Eddy, of the Duke University Center for 

Health Policy Research and Education, screening 10,000 women with a Pap 

smear every three years from their twenties to their seventies would 

prevent about 200 of them from developing invasive cervical cancer; if 

each detected cervical cancer translated into an additional ten years of 

life, the cost to society would be approximately $150,000 per woman 

benefited. Eddy's calculation cannot be directly compared with that of 

Wright and Mueller, because it used a different methodology. Nonetheless, 

it is clear that Pap smears provide much more benefit than mammograms, at 

a small fraction of the cost.<p>

Is mammography worth it? I would argue, with Wright and Mueller, that "the 

benefits of mass population screening, even in older women, are too small 

and the harm and cost generated too great to justify widespread 

implementation of screening mammography." In fact, the authors suggest 

that routine mammography should be recommended only for women at high risk 

of developing breast cancer, such as those whose mothers or sisters 

developed breast cancer early in life. There is little factual basis for 

this plausible-sounding suggestion, though. <p>

A similar radical stance was adopted by Michael Baum, the research 

director of the British Institute of Cancer Research, who quit England's 

national breast-cancer-screening advisory board last September because 

nationwide mammography is "not worth doing." Having helped to set up the 

country's screening program, he was disturbed by claims about the 

effectiveness of mammography. The London <I>Sunday Times </I> quoted Baum 

as saying, "There is a political correctness about screening. I took pride 

in setting up the service, which is as efficient as it can be, but just 

because you are doing something efficiently, it doesn't mean it is worth 

doing." <p>

Abandoning widespread mammography in the United States is probably not 

feasible. After years of effort invested in encouraging mammography, to 

reverse course would cause widespread confusion and anger. Alarmed by the 

contradictory recommendations of "experts," women would probably keep 

having mammograms, just to be safe--and in their shoes I might do the 

same. Moreover, many physicians believe that routine mammography 

encourages women to come in for regular checkups, and thus may play an 

important role in general preventive medicine.<p>

On balance, then, I reluctantly support the status quo. When my patients 

come in for their mammograms, I do not try to dissuade them. But I tell 

them that the most optimistic interpretation of the available evidence 

suggests that routine mammography has only a marginal effect on a woman's 

chances of surviving breast cancer--and that it may have no effect at 

all.<P><br>

<CENTER><b>ARE WE CURING <br>

BREAST CANCER? </b><p>

</CENTER> Once a tumor has been found, whether by mammography or 

palpation, it must be treated. The basis for the contemporary approach 

dates back to the 1890s, when William Halsted, a professor of surgery at 

Johns Hopkins University, developed radical mastectomy--the technique 

for removing a breast, the underlying chest muscles, and the lymph nodes 

in the armpit. A giant in medical history, Halsted was held in such 

respect that surgeons after him took an uncommonly long time to admit that 

his ideas about cancer were off base. He believed that breast cancer oozed 

slowly through the lymphatic system of the body the way foul water from a 

brackish pond travels through ditches to other parts of the landscape. 

(The lymphatic system is the collection of ducts, lymph nodes, and other 

organs that drain the tissue fluid called lymph into the bloodstream.) To 

Halsted's way of thinking, breast cancer could be cured by carving a wide 

swath around the initial tumor and its draining sites, leaving clear 

margins of healthy tissue--a scorched-earth approach. <p>

Seventy-five years later a number of North American researchers began 

questioning Halsted's ideas. Instead of seeping slowly throughout the body 

from its initial site, breast cancer seemed to hop from place to place as 

cells sloughed off by the main tumor mass floated through the bloodstream. 

If this was true, removing a woman's entire breast would often be 

pointless, because most of the tissue surrounding the tumor would be 

healthy. After this heretical notion provoked much controversy among 

cancer specialists, Bernard Fisher, of the University of Pittsburgh, put 

together a series of large clinical trials that were intended to resolve 

the dispute. These trials demonstrated that a much less drastic operation 

called a lumpectomy was appropriate in many cases; when combined with 

radiation therapy it provided a chance of survival indistinguishable from 

that provided by Halsted-style mastectomy. After the results were 

published, in the mid-1980s, surgical practices changed. Remarkably, 

though, they didn't change very fast. Even today only a third of the women 

who undergo breast surgery have lumpectomies, whereas at least two thirds 

probably could, in light of the size of their tumors. The rest have 

modified radical mastectomies, a somewhat less severe version of Halsted's 

operation.<p>

In the same period researchers questioned another tacit assumption about 

breast cancer: that lumps in the breast appear suddenly and must be 

treated quickly. Instead we have come to think that most breast tumors 

take years to develop to detectable size; some need decades. In its 

initial stages the tumor would be visible under a microscope--if one 

could somehow scan the entire breast with such precision. Only after 

months or years, however, can the malignancy be detected on a mammogram or 

by palpation. Yet standard practice still involves a rush to operate after 

diagnosis. The patient wants to know the details of her condition right 

away, and surgical exploration is the only conclusive means of providing 

this information. But surgeons also operate partly in the name of "getting 

this thing out before it spreads." I cannot count the number of times I 

have seen a surgeon solemnly tell anxious family members in the hospital 

waiting room, "Well, we got it all." Although surgeons today target their 

work more carefully and humanely than they did in the past, they still 

ignore a crucial fact: we cannot know whether we "got it all." Although 

our treatments can eliminate the primary tumor (not a small consideration, 

given its potential danger), there is little evidence that we actually 

eradicate breast cancer in any more patients than we did decades ago. <p>

As I said, switching when appropriate from mastectomy to lumpectomy leaves 

survival rates unaffected--the less-severe operation simply does the 

same job. And we have, in my view, less than compelling evidence that 

routine mammography benefits otherwise healthy women. Any improvement in 

our treatment of breast cancer must therefore come from radiation or 

chemotherapy, both of which are by now standard practice. After a 

lumpectomy, according to a meta-analysis published last November in the 

<a href="http://www.nejm.org/">

<I>New England Journal of Medicine</I></a>, radiation decreases the risk of 

recurrence in the breast region (local-regional recurrence, as it is 

known) to that associated with full mastectomy--five to 10 percent 

during the next ten years. Without radiation the risk is about 20 percent. 

But radiation has no known effect on distant metastases from breast cancer 

(nonlocal recurrence), which are the chief sources of danger. As a result, 

post-surgical radiation has no demonstrable effect on survival--a 

point seldom made clear to patients. Reducing local recurrence is a 

reasonable goal, because any tumor in the breast could be lethal. But it 

will not diminish the danger from metastases.<p>

Nor should we think that the modest benefit from radiation has no price. 

Radiation therapy is rough on the body. It kills cells, inducing 

inflammation in the breast. Responding to the inflammation, cells called 

fibroblasts proliferate and lay down scar tissue. Fifteen to twenty-five 

years after radiation therapy tissues in the irradiated area often feel 

thick, hard, even wooden--a strange, unpleasant sensation. Meanwhile, 

the blast of radiation may have created genetic damage that will lead to 

other types of cancer. For instance, worrisome evidence suggests that 

radiation may promote lung cancer in the irradiated side of the body. The 

risk seems slight, but its mere possibility should remind physicians that 

radiation therapy is not without its price. <p>

Chemotherapy is a more complex issue, with better-established benefits and 

fewer side effects than it had in the past. Chemotherapeutic compounds 

kill cancer cells; the hope is that they will destroy any metastases 

lurking in the body. Thirty years ago chemotherapy was a treatment of last 

resort, administered only to patients with extensive metastatic disease. I 

can recall flying overnight to the University of Wisconsin in 1959 to pick 

up some precious vials of 5-fluorouracil, one of the first, 

then-experimental chemotherapeutic treatments, for a woman whose cancer 

was overwhelming her liver. I was dismayed when the drug made her 

extremely sick, though I thought that it might have postponed her death a 

little. In the early 1970s researchers discovered that chemotherapy was 

also effective when several agents were administered right after 

surgery--as an adjuvant treatment, in the jargon. Today chemotherapy 

is usually given in the form of a pharmaceutical cocktail, one of the most 

common being cyclophosphamide (sold principally under the trade name 

Cytoxan), doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and the original 5-fluorouracil (sold 

under several names, but usually called 5-FU). Although we have discovered 

how to moderate the side effects of chemotherapy, it is still heavy going. 

Common complaints include fatigue, nausea, hair loss, mouth sores, 

diarrhea, and premature menopause. <p>

Chemotherapy is more effective in younger, pre-menopausal women than in 

older, postmenopausal women. Many researchers believe that premenopausal 

women receive this extra benefit because the drugs chemically destroy the 

function of their ovaries, frequently stopping their monthly 

estrogen-progesterone cycles. The decline in hormone production affects 

the two out of three tumors that are estrogen- or 

progesterone-receptor-positive. Deprived of the chemical catalyst they 

need to grow, the metastases often shrink, lengthening the time until they 

become dangerous.<p>

Before chemotherapy, doctors sought to create a similar effect by directly 

removing patients' ovaries. If the cancer recurred, they tried to amplify 

the effect by removing women's adrenal glands. These small, triangular 

organs sit atop the kidneys and secrete hormones, one of which is DHEA, a 

still-mysterious substance that is a favorite preoccupation of health 

faddists. Most women convert some of the DHEA into estrogen, thus 

producing small amounts of estrogen after menopause. Even cutting out the 

adrenal glands--a procedure involving major abdominal 

surgery--wasn't the final step. In their zeal to combat estrogen, 

doctors also injected women with testosterone or prescribed synthetic male 

hormones. <p>

Although these treatments sometimes slowed the progress of breast cancer, 

their cumulative impact was horrific and even barbarous. After having the 

breast and underlying tissue on one side of her chest cut away and covered 

with a thin skin graft, a woman could be subjected to intense radiation 

therapy, primitive forms of chemotherapy, the removal of her ovaries, and, 

eventually, the removal of her adrenal glands. If this failed, she might 

be injected with male hormones that made her skin oily, pimply, and hairy. 

<p>

Things are better today. Surgery is often less severe; chemotherapy can be 

more tolerable; and, perhaps most important, there is a substitute for 

removing the adrenal glands and injecting women with testosterone. In the 

1970s researchers discovered that the actions of estrogen and other 

hormones can be blocked chemically by drugs called hormone antagonists, of 

which the most noteworthy is tamoxifen, which is sold under the trade name 

Nolvadex. Circulating in the body, tamoxifen molecules prevent breast 

cells from linking up to estrogen or progesterone molecules by attaching 

themselves to the cells in their place, blocking the hormones completely. 

Because hormones can stimulate the growth of the majority of breast tumors 

that are estrogen- or progesterone-receptor-positive, the potential of 

tamoxifen for treating this type of cancer is clear. (Tumors that do not 

respond to hormones grow faster and are less treatable.) Tamoxifen can 

cause irregular periods or aggravate hot flashes; it also apparently 

increases the risk of uterine cancer. But it is a vast improvement over 

removing women's adrenal glands.<p>

Many studies have shown that the unwanted side effects of chemotherapy and 

antihormonal therapy are offset by the benefits. A compelling example is 

the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, an Oxford-based 

meta-analysis of 133 randomized clinical trials around the world which 

examined the effects of chemotherapy and antihormonal tamoxifen therapy on 

74,652 women with breast cancer. In the trials breast-cancer patients were 

usually given mastectomies or lumpectomies and then divided randomly into 

two groups: one that received some type of chemotherapy or antihormonal 

therapy (the test group) and one that did not (the control group). The 

Oxford group reported in 1992 that women who underwent either treatment 

after surgery had a 12 to 14 percent greater chance of surviving for ten 

years than those who did not.<p>

Note, though, exactly how this good news was phrased. The improved 

survival prospect for women who underwent these treatments was in 

comparison with the prospect for breast-cancer patients who received no 

systemic therapy--a relative, rather than absolute, increase in 

survival. Without chemotherapy, a woman with breast cancer faces a 55 

percent chance of dying within ten years, according to the Oxford team. 

Chemotherapy cuts the figure to 48.7 percent, an absolute difference of 

6.3 percent. Similar figures appeared in the tamoxifen trials. After 

surgery 41.2 percent of the women receiving tamoxifen died within ten 

years, whereas 47.4 percent of the control group died--an absolute 

difference of 6.2 percent. The treatments, then, buy some time for some 

women, and this is a very good thing; any woman told that she has even a 

small chance of surviving longer with adjuvant treatment will likely 

choose it. Nevertheless, we should not be extolling these therapies as 

major breakthroughs.<p>

"Wait a minute," some readers may be saying. "Are you being too quick to 

dismiss these results? Don't these decreases in risk mean that we are 

eliminating this disease in some people? It may be a small number, but 

aren't we curing a few more than we did in the past?" These questions are 

difficult to answer, not least because they involve coming up with a good 

definition of "cure." For instance, if a woman of sixty-five is treated 

for breast cancer and then dies five years later of a heart attack, was 

she "cured" of cancer? Her family, friends, and even her doctor might 

think so, because the disease never troubled her again. Indeed, a common 

clinical definition of "cure" is survival for five or ten years. Many 

researchers would be less quick to claim a cure, because the cancer might 

have been on its way to recurring when the heart attack intervened. <p>

Acknowledging these complexities, statisticians evolved a precise 

definition for "cure" in the 1950s. A true cure of a lethal disease like 

breast cancer is achieved <I>only </I>when people with that disease face 

the same chance of death as others in the population of the same age and 

sex. Such true cures are possible with many diseases. Most pneumonia 

sufferers, for instance, after recovering with the aid of antibiotics have 

exactly the same prospects for survival as people who have never had 

pneumonia. Like pneumonia, some cancers, including cervical cancer, 

childhood leukemia, superficial melanomas, and Hodgkin's disease, can be 

truly cured. <p>

Breast cancer, unfortunately, is not among this select group. As far as we 

know, a woman found to have invasive breast cancer is always at higher 

risk of dying prematurely than women without breast cancer. Even thirty 

years after her diagnosis she is up to sixteen times as likely to die of 

the disease as a woman in the general population. That is why responsible 

researchers in this field avoid the word "cure." Even as they report 

advances, they must acknowledge the reality: Postsurgical chemotherapy and 

antihormonal therapy do buy time--an important advance. The slowed 

progress of the disease can give a woman additional years of life and even 

allow her to die of other, less traumatic, causes. But breast cancer is 

every bit as incurable as it was in Halsted's day. <P><br>



<CENTER><b>ANOTHER VIEW <br>OF BREAST CANCER </b> <p>

</CENTER>In 1935, 26.2 out of every 100,000 women died of breast cancer. 

That was a long time ago, of course, when life expectancy for women was 

sixty-four years. Americans now live longer, which means that diseases of 

the elderly are more common. Although breast cancer affects many young 

women, it is still principally a disease of middle and old age--the 

median age at diagnosis is sixty-four. Statisticians must adjust raw data 

about incidence and mortality to compensate for underlying demographic 

shifts. In 1992, the latest year for which figures are available, the 

adjusted rate of mortality was 26.2 women per 100,000--the same as in 

1935. (The death rate rose a bit from 1986 to 1989 and declined by about 

the same amount from 1989 to 1992.) Since 1935 medicine has seen 

improvements in surgical technique and anesthesia, and the introduction of 

mammography, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, along with an enormous 

jump in general medical knowledge. But all this progress has had no effect 

on the chances that an individual woman will die of breast cancer. To my 

way of thinking, the constancy of the death rate in the face of rising 

incidence and aggressive treatment is a strong hint that we need to 

approach the disease in another way. <p>

When I discussed the evidence relating to mammography, radiation, and 

chemotherapy, I was in the realm of fact--although some colleagues may 

disagree with my interpretation. In what follows I am moving into 

unsteadier terrain. Of course, I believe that my view of breast cancer is 

correct, and much of it is shared by other specialists. But I will be 

satisfied if I can persuade readers that the mere existence of a coherent 

alternative explanation raises questions about the mainstream view. <p>

As I have said, almost all cancer researchers think that the disease is 

triggered by an accidental change in the DNA of at least one cell. That 

cell divides, producing two cells, then four, then eight, and so on, with 

the volume of the tumor doubling in each successive generation. By the 

time the tumor has doubled twenty-three times, the original cancer cell 

has multiplied to more than eight million. At that point the tumor is 

about an eighth of an inch in diameter, just big enough to be detected 

(sometimes) by a mammogram. <p>

Such a tumor is not very dangerous by itself; the danger lies in the 

metastases. The question is how soon the tumor metastasizes. <p>

For almost thirty years John S. Spratt, a cancer surgeon now at the 

University of Louisville Department of Surgery, has been measuring the 

growth rates of breast tumors. In one of his most recent studies, 

performed in collaboration with researchers from Heidelberg, Germany, 

Spratt examined the progressive mammograms of 448 women who had tumors 

that turned out to have been visible in mammograms made before the tumors 

were diagnosed. (The women's doctors were not necessarily at fault for 

missing the tumors; in many cases mammographic imagery is ambiguous.) 

Comparing first, second, and even third mammograms provided evidence of 

how fast the tumors grew in the intervals. The median doubling time was 

260 days, but the range was considerable: the fastest tumor doubled in ten 

days, the slowest in 7,051 days--that is, almost twenty years. These 

figures have striking implications. <p>

Consider a woman who is unlucky enough to develop a single cancerous cell 

on her forty-third birthday. If the woman is especially unlucky, the cell 

has a fast doubling time of, say, thirty days. Twenty-three cell 

generations later the tumor might be visible on a mammogram; in another 

six or seven doublings it will be just big enough to feel. By then the 

woman will be forty-five. She will probably die before her fiftieth 

birthday. If, though, the woman develops a cancer with a slow doubling 

time of, say, 360 days, twenty-three doublings will take about 

twenty-three years, at which point the tumor might be seen with 

mammography. The tumor will be palpable in another six or seven years, 

meaning that without mammography it probably would not be detected until 

the woman was in her mid-seventies. By that age some people have already 

died of other causes. <p>

I have simplified these calculations considerably. Spratt and his German 

colleagues found that breast cancers do not grow at a constant rate but 

instead slow down as time passes. Yet the principle holds that tumors that 

begin with fast doubling rates grow faster than tumors that begin with 

slow doubling rates at comparable stages of formation. <p>

Close scrutiny of tumor doubling times could explain why the earlier 

diagnoses provided by mammography seem to provide so little prolonging of 

individual lives, despite the statistical appearance of benefit caused by 

earlier diagnosis. Although mammography is able to spot tumors as small as 

an eighth of an inch, which contain eight million cells, the average size 

at diagnosis with mammography is about 600 million cells. Such a tumor is 

only a bit more than a quarter of an inch across, but it has already 

doubled almost twenty-seven times and may have been in the body for 

decades. The average size of tumors detected by palpation is about 45 

billion cells and about an inch and a quarter in diameter; these tumors 

have doubled an additional eight or nine times. To argue that earlier 

diagnosis provides an important benefit, one must believe that the tumor 

is considerably likelier to spread in those eight or nine later doublings 

than it was in the preceding twenty-seven. <p>

There is no evidence that this is the case; indeed, the small amount of 

available data suggests that this view is wrong. With mammography we can 

see breast tumors earlier than we could before. But it is illogical to 

assume that our newfound ability to observe breast tumors between the 

twenty-seventh and thirty-fifth doublings means that they are especially 

likely to spread during this time or afterward and not before. If tumors 

are more likely to metastasize after rather than before mammography can 

detect them, the burden is on mammography advocates to demonstrate it. 

Meanwhile, I believe that the reasonable course is to assume that breast 

cancer can spread at any time in its development, and that metastasis has 

probably already occurred by the time we are able to detect the primary 

tumor. If this view is correct--and I should stress that studies to 

prove it have not yet been conducted--then it would explain why 

research has had such difficulty proving that mammography can save women's 

lives.<p>

Similarly, examination of tumor doubling times could explain why 

chemotherapy boosts five- and ten-year survival rates but has little 

impact on the annual percentage of women who die of breast 

cancer--that is, why it helps women with the disease to live longer 

but leaves them just as likely to die of metastatic breast cancer in the 

end. My best guess is that adjuvant chemotherapy wipes out 95 to 99.9 

percent of the residual cancer cells in a patient's body. (It doesn't get 

them all because the remaining tumor cells are innately resistant to 

chemotherapy.) Expressed as a percentage, the figures are impressive, but 

the actual impact is surprisingly slight. Suppose that a woman's tumor has 

metastasized and that the new tumor has grown to a million cells--a 

lot of cells, but not enough to be seen by the naked eye, or palpated, or 

spotted by any current imaging method (CAT scan, ultrasound, magnetic 

resonance imaging, and so on). If chemotherapy kills 99 percent of the 

cancer cells in a woman's body, this prophylactic treatment will reduce 

the metastasis from a million cells to 10,000. The remaining cells, which 

are resistant to chemotherapy, will keep on proliferating, more than 

likely at the same rate. In six and two thirds cell generations the tumor 

will have grown back to a million cells and the woman will be right back 

where she was before treatment began. <p>

Cruelly, chemotherapy helps least those who need it most. If a woman's 

cancer has the short doubling time of thirty days, the six and two thirds 

doublings the tumor needs to recover from chemotherapy translate into 

about 200 days. Because chemotherapy is often administered monthly for six 

months, the gain is roughly equivalent to the length of treatment. 

Producing so much suffering, chemotherapy would in this case be a dubious 

exercise. If the woman's cancer has a doubling time of 360 days, however, 

she would gain 2,400 days, which is six and a half years. That sounds like 

a good payoff, but does she need it?If cancer were diagnosed in that woman 

at sixty-four (the median age of diagnosis), her slow-growing metastases 

would probably not become life-threatening for twenty to twenty-five 

years, when she would be in her late eighties. Because most people do not 

live that long, there would be little point in subjecting her to a round 

of chemotherapeutic treatment that would give her another seven years when 

she probably would die of something else in the meantime. If chemotherapy 

has little impact on a woman's chance of surviving either aggressive or 

indolent tumors, is it any wonder that it makes few inroads on mortality? 

<p>

At the same time, chemotherapy should not be dismissed. The calculations 

above, for doubling times of thirty and 360 days, represent extremes; I 

used them to illustrate my point. A more representative example would 

apply Spratt's median doubling time of 260 days to my hypothetical 

forty-three-year-old woman. If, as before, the first cancer cell develops 

on her birthday, the resultant tumor could take eighteen to twenty years 

to show up on a mammogram. (Such calculations are necessarily inexact, 

because individual tumors do not always grow at the same rate.) The woman 

would then be in her early sixties--near the median age of diagnosis. 

With no treatment other than lumpectomy, she would be likely to die before 

the age of seventy-five. But if chemotherapy gave the woman the time it 

would take the tumor to double another six or seven times, the onset of 

life-threatening metastatic disease would be postponed until the woman was 

at least eighty; antihormonal therapy might buy an equivalent number of 

years. In real terms the achievement would probably be smaller, because 

people in their eighties are likely to die of heart disease or some other 

condition. Nonetheless, the woman would have gained five to ten years of 

life. This is a precious gift, one that she and her doctor can justly 

celebrate. <p>

But consider the breast-cancer patients doctors most dread 

seeing--women in their thirties or forties. Such cases are relatively 

uncommon; breast cancer owes its status as the leading killer of women in 

this age group mostly to the even lower likelihood that they will be 

killed by anything else. Nonetheless, the individual tragedy of a disease 

that strikes down young, vibrant people makes it disproportionately urgent 

to treat them. Sadly, younger women in whom cancer is diagnosed are more 

likely than older women to have fast-growing tumors, because slow-growing 

tumors are usually still too small to detect. Given the probable doubling 

rates, these women will be lucky if we can give them an extra five years. 

Five years is, of course, much better than nothing--but much less than 

the thirty or forty years these women will lose. Anyone who treats younger 

breast-cancer patients knows that we will not have made major progress in 

the treatment of this disease until we can give women like these, with 

fast-growing cancers, thirty doubling times rather than six or 

seven.<P><br>

<CENTER><b>CANCER OLD AND NEW</b><p>

</CENTER>In effect, mammography today provides our definition of breast 

cancer. Any tumor spotted on a mammogram is treated, almost reflexively, 

with surgery, radiation, and often chemotherapy and antihormonal drugs. 

Thinking about doubling times suggests the inadequacy of this approach. 

When doctors diagnosed breast cancer by palpation in annual exams, they 

found principally fast-growing tumors--ones whose average doubling 

time, according to the work of Spratt and other researchers, was about 

ninety days. Despite decades of work, medicine still is unable to treat 

this kind of cancer effectively. Today the spectrum of breast cancer is 

different. Perhaps because of the hormonal changes created by the changes 

in women's lives, physicians are increasingly likely to observe the "new" 

cancer described above, which is slower-growing and much less dangerous. 

These cancers, because they progress so much more slowly, have a radically 

different impact on women's lives. For that reason we should be more 

discriminating in how we treat them.<p>

"New" may be a misnomer for this slow-growing breast cancer. Although its 

incidence has risen, I suspect that it has been with us for at least fifty 

years; we just weren't able to see it. In fact, I would not be surprised 

if someday we are all found to harbor somewhere in our bodies several 

small, slow-growing tumors that will never cause us any problems. (They 

are beaten to the punch by cardiovascular disease or faster-growing 

cancers.) <p>

Among the most important varieties of the new breast cancer is the <I>in 

situ</I> tumor--the small, localized, almost nongrowing tumor that at 

the time of diagnosis has seemingly neither become invasive nor developed 

the capacity to metastasize. Prior to mammography, as noted earlier, <I>in 

situ</I> tumors accounted for only one to two percent of all breast-cancer 

diagnoses, whereas today in communities where people see doctors often and 

have lots of tests, <I>in situ</I> tumors account for at least 10 percent 

of all breast-cancer diagnoses. After lumpectomy and radiation, only one 

out of ten <I>in situ</I> malignancies recurs in the next five to eight 

years. <p>

Most of my colleagues celebrate this as a triumph, because it appears that 

we are catching cancers earlier than ever and curing more of them. They 

may be right. But consider this--if one out of ten <I>in situ 

</I>cancers recurs after treatment, nine out of ten do not. If my view is 

correct, even without treatment many or most <I>in situ</I> cancers would 

never have grown big enough to be detected by palpation, let alone to pose 

a threat to life. They might even have become invasive and metastasized, 

but the metastases would also be too small to be detectable and would 

never be lethal--rendering the recurrence rate and thus the question 

of treatment ultimately unimportant to survival. As a result, mammography 

is only leading physicians to diagnose an ever-larger number of harmless 

tumors. Patients who otherwise would never have known they have cancer may 

needlessly suffer through the unique pain, anxiety, disfigurement, and 

expense associated with modern medicine and cancer. For all we know, the 

chief effect of mammography has been to disguise our inability to cure the 

old cancer, by burying it in cases of new cancer. <P><br>

<CENTER><b>WHEN THE DIAGNOSIS <br>

IS POSITIVE </b> <p>

</CENTER>Because of the prevalence of <I>in situ </I> and other 

slow-growing breast cancers, women who receive a positive mammogram should 

not despair. Two thirds to four fifths of positive mammograms lead to 

biopsies that do not reveal cancer. Even if the biopsy indicates cancer, 

the patient should keep in mind that not all tumors are truly dangerous, 

and she should strive to learn what kind of tumor she has.<p>

Although scientists are divided in their opinion of its accuracy, I 

believe that one of the most promising gauges of risk is the "S-phase 

fraction," which is a rough measure of a tumor's doubling time, derived 

from a technique known as flow cytometry. Technicians calculate this 

measure by chopping up a small amount of tumor tissue in a kind of 

specialized blender, staining the cell nuclei with a dye, and squirting 

the result one cell at a time through a very fine nozzle. The cells shoot 

through a thin laser beam, each nucleus casting a shadow as it crosses the 

light. Computers record the shadows with enough detail to discern the 

approximate percentage of cells in the sample that are dividing. From 

these data physicians can infer whether the cancer is aggressive (a 

doubling time of sixty days or less), moderate (sixty-one to 150 days), 

indolent (151 to 300 days), or very indolent (more than 300 days). Because 

tumor growth rates may change over time, and metastases do not necessarily 

march in lockstep with the tumors that spawned them, the actual situation 

faced by patients is more complex than indicated by this summary. 

Nevertheless, Ibelieve that the broad principle holds:armed with 

information about a tumor's growth rate and the patient's age at 

diagnosis, doctors could often be more informative than they are now about 

what lies ahead for their patients. <p>

If doctors could accurately gauge tumor growth rates, using any 

agreed-upon test, my strong hunch is that about a third of the tumors now 

detected would be found not to need treatment beyond removal of the tumor 

itself. Perhaps another quarter of women in whom breast cancer is 

diagnosed could gain considerable time--enough to take them safely 

into old age--with antihormonal therapy alone. The remainder could be 

helped by the combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, though 

not nearly as much as the providers of these treatments or their patients 

would hope. For this last group of women, I am very sorry to say, modern 

medicine has less to offer than newspaper headlines suggest. The outcome 

was dictated well before diagnosis--by the date the first cancer cells 

developed and by the rate at which they grew. <p>

If, as I suspect, a woman's fate is set very early in the development of a 

tumor, it seems implausible that advances in detection will have an impact 

on the disease. One can always hope that science will develop a wonder 

drug that eradicates tumors completely, even when they can't be seen or 

felt. But for the present I think we should focus research on improving 

our ability to distinguish between women with breast cancer who can 

benefit from aggressive treatment and the larger number who will gain 

little from it no matter what we do. <p>

The ultimate hope is preventing this awful disease, perhaps by modifying 

the contemporary hormonal environment that seems to promote it. 

Researchers at the University of Southern California have been examining 

ways to lower young women's exposure to reproductive hormones. Another 

approach is to use an anti-estrogen drug like tamoxifen preventively in 

postmenopausal women whose histories of breast problems indicate that they 

are at high risk of developing cancer; I am involved in a study that is 

examining this kind of treatment. The risks in changing the hormonal 

balance of millions of women are considerable, however, and it seems 

likely that any new preventive for breast cancer will have its own side 

effects. <p>

Advances in this area will surely be slow, but they may be the only 

realistic hope for eventually lowering the death rate from breast cancer. 

Meanwhile, we should carefully consider whether we are misleading some 

women with messages of unwarranted hope at the same time that we are 

needlessly terrifying and hurting other women by diagnosing and treating a 

condition that will never pose a threat to their lives.

conclusions from epidemiologic reports</i></font></center><p>

	

	<pre>



	</pre>

	

	

	<font size=5>I</font>t's tempting to develop an immunity to health reporting. Many of us believe

that today's ominous medical advisory will become tomorrow's tired joke, along

the lines of the rat who has to drink a thousand cans of diet soda a day to get

cancer. We're hardened to reports of health hazards, and have come to expect

warnings to be quickly overruled by future research. This is a dangerous

assumption, however. Frequently the error is not in the research but in its

interpretation.<p>



<p>



Epidemiologic evidence is particularly prone to this problem. Epidemiology, the

study of the causes and patterns of disease in human populations, is

misunderstood so often precisely because it appears to be so accessible. The

epidemiologist's job can be likened to that of a detective--he cracks the code

of the disease by uncovering its mode of operation. To do this, an

epidemiologist can do several things. One is to follow a large group of people

for a long period of time, see what diseases they develop, and then correlate

the diseases with other factors in their lives. An example of such a "cohort

study" is the Framingham heart study, in which a sample of the adult population

of Framingham, Massachusetts, has been followed since 1948, in order to tease

out factors that influence their risk of heart disease. Another epidemiologic

method, called the case-control approach, involves comparing victims of a

particular disease or condition with people who don't have it, and looking for

a significant difference between the groups in some variable like diet, living

conditions, age, or ethnic background. An example would be a study published in

1979 in The Lancet, for which the researchers had looked at oral-contraceptive

use by a group of women who had suffered heart attacks and by another group who

hadn't.<p>



<p>



The purpose of both approaches is to piece together a pattern that will point

to the underlying cause, or causes, of a particular disease or syndrome. An

individual study provides clues but is not designed to provide proof that a

particular disease is caused or prevented by a particular agent. Since

epidemiologic research involves people rather than laboratory animals, it is

especially tempting to extrapolate from the sample in a particular study to the

public. This is generally a mistake.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE recent front-page reports of a link between breast cancer and moderate

alcohol consumption offer an excellent example of how misleading such

extrapolations can be. The studies prompting the headlines, published last May

in The New England Journal of Medicine, were done by Dr. Arthur Schatzkin, a

senior staff fellow at the National Cancer Institute, and Dr. Walter Willett,

an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health.

Both were cohort studies. Both found an association between moderate alcohol

consumption--as few as three drinks of beer, wine, or liquor a week--and an

increased risk of breast cancer, an increase of as much as 50 percent. These

papers were accompanied by an editorial by Saxon Graham, an epidemiologist at

the State University of New York at Buffalo. Graham recommended that women at

high risk of breast cancer "curtail their alcohol ingestion." Such women, he

said, include those who have a family history of the disease, who are obese,

who were older than twenty-five when they had their first child, or who have

few or no children. <p>



<p>



This, clearly, is no small group, and it would seem that millions of women are

risking decades of life for the sake of an occasional quick one. Such is not,

however, the case. Understanding why requires a grounding in statistics.<p>



<p>



Breast cancer is an extremely common disease. One in eleven women, or about

nine percent of all women, will get it at some point. It seems logical to infer

from this fact, in combination with the studies' estimates of increased risk,

that drinking half a bottle of wine a week increases one's risk of breast

cancer from nine to nearly 14 percent--a sobering prospect. Several reports

made just this inference, but it is incorrect. As the Harvard Medical School

Health Letter pointed out in a follow-up of the Schatzkin and Willett studies,

published last July, the figure of nine percent includes all women, while the

estimates of a 50 percent increased risk given by both studies are based on a

comparison between drinkers and non-drinkers. Also, the studies suggest that

the women whose risk of breast cancer is most increased by drinking are women

otherwise at low risk for the disease--young women of normal weight with no

family history of breast cancer. Very few people in this category get breast

cancer, so it is easy for any variable to appear to the lay person to modify

greatly their risk. A statistician's evaluation of the data, undertaken at the

request of the Harvard newsletter, concludes that if these studies accurately

reflect incidence in the population as a whole, moderate drinking is

responsible for only one or two percent of all breast-cancer cases.<p>



<p>



Does this mean that one to two percent of all women who get breast cancer bring

it upon themselves by enjoying an occasional beer? Not necessarily. There are

factors that confound even this relatively modest conclusion--factors that have

to do with the way the researchers chose to frame their studies. For example,

neither study took the subjects' early diet into consideration. What a woman

ate as a child and teenager is suspected of having a significant effect on her

risk of breast cancer. But since the diet-cancer connection has not been

proved, and since it is almost impossible to get information on early diet (how

many fifty-year-olds remember in detail what they ate as teenagers?), early

diet was not taken into consideration in either the Willett or the Schatzkin

study.<p>



<p>



Nor was exercise considered. Research done at the Harvard School of Public

Health and the State University of New York at Buffalo suggests that exercise,

especially during childhood and adolescence, decreases the risk of breast

cancer. But, again, this research is not conclusive, so exercise was not

included as a variable in either study.<p>



<p>



This does not mean that the studies are incorrect or misleading. In fact, there

have been at least a dozen other reports linking breast cancer with alcohol

consumption. One recent study was published in the April issue of the Journal

of the National Cancer Institute. Elizabeth Harvey, an epidemiologist who was

also a co-author on the Schatzkin study, concluded in the NCI Journal report

that<p>



drinking even moderate amounts of beer, wine, or liquor was, indeed, associated

with increased breast-cancer risk, but only for women who began drinking when

they were under thirty years old. What women drank after they hit thirty seems

to have had no significant effect on their risk. Harvey told me that this paper

received little publicity, and it was not acknowledged in the New England

Journal of Medicine editorial. But what concerns her is that all the press and

television reports have called for a change in women's drinking habits because

of the other studies. She considers particularly misleading the comments of a

network-television medical reporter, who suggested that viewers already at high

risk of breast cancer should abstain entirely. However, such comments are

certainly understandable in light of Saxon Graham's NEJM editorial. Graham

recommended that women at high risk cut back on their drinking not because the

science necessarily dictated it but because he believed it to be prudent.

Journalists simply took his recommendations one step further.<p>



<p>



The NEJM published the Schatzkin and Willett studies back to back, along with

the Graham editorial, because the journal's editors realized that they were

provocative, not only to the informed academic community but also to the

public. Health and medical reporters commonly subscribe to The New England

Journal of Medicine--it is the most comprehensive, easily understood, and

highly publicized journal in its field--and so the Schatzkin and Willett papers

received much more attention than they would have if they had appeared in some

more obscure or specialized publication. It is clear that the authors wanted as

broad an audience as possible--an audience that would include journalists and

other lay people.<p>



<p>



The alcohol-and-breast-cancer studies are valid and important pieces of work,

but, as the authors insisted, they are preliminary. No one can assume a

cause-and-effect relationship between drinking moderate amounts of alcohol and

contracting breast cancer. It is quite possible that something that goes along

with drinking, such as eating cocktail snacks or sitting on bar stools, is what

increases the risk of cancer. It could also be that women who drink, on

average, exercise less or eat more fat or consume fewer vitamins than women who

do not drink. Drinking might thus be a mere artifact, the fall guy for some

other, as yet unknown culprit.<p>

<font size=5>E</font>PIDEMIOLOGIC studies are particularly vulnerable to premature interpretation

by both the press and scientists eager to stimulate public interest. They are

naturally intriguing. But they cannot, by definition, provide proof of the

cause of a problem. The associations they uncover can seem overwhelming, and

when enough studies over a long period have pointed to the same conclusion,

scientists will agree to accept an agent or combination of agents as the

"cause" of a disease. The majority of smokers, for example, do not get lung

cancer, and scientists cannot say with absolute certainty that some other,

predisposing factor is not involved. Still, the association between lung cancer

and smoking is so strong--smokers have a risk of developing lung cancer ten to

twenty times greater than that of nonsmokers--that smoking is generally

accepted to be an important cause of lung cancer. Tobacco interests continue to

dispute this assumption. The statistical link between breast cancer and

moderate alcohol consumption is by comparison extremely weak: light drinking

appears not even to double a woman's risk of getting cancer. Such a weak

association does not allow conclusions to be drawn. It merely suggests a

relationship that deserves further exploration.<p>



<p>



Epidemiologic studies are prone to misinterpretations for other reasons, too.

For example, it is almost impossible to get a truly random sample of the

population to study, and the choice of study participants can markedly bias

results. A rather extreme example of this is a study done several years ago

that showed an association between pancreatic cancer and coffee consumption. It

was a retroactive study, in which patients hospitalized for the treatment of

pancreatic cancer were compared with a control group of patients, over 30

percent of whom were hospitalized for other digestive disorders. The authors of

the study found that the cancer patients drank significantly more coffee than

the other patients, which caused them to suspect a link between coffee drinking

and cancer. Their methods were later challenged by other experts, who pointed

out that patients with digestive disorders are likely to restrict their coffee

intake. Clearly, the control group selected by the research team was entirely

inappropriate. Some subsequent studies have suggested a more tentative

association between coffee and pancreatic cancer, but the public still links

the two strongly because of the highly publicized study.<p>



<p>



Another problem is that epidemiologic research is often heavily dependent on

subjects' reports of their own behavior. Memory is notoriously selective, and

tends to screen out what it would prefer had never happened. For example, the

continuing confusion over whether obese people truly eat more than people of

normal weight is due in part to the fact that it is nearly impossible to get

good dietary histories from anyone, let alone from the obese. Thus scientific

reports suggesting that obese people eat no more than people of normal weight

share shelf space with reports claiming quite the opposite.<p>



<p>



The inherent limitations of the epidemiologic approach do not render it

invalid. But like most scientific research, population studies provide

information that is meaningless when considered in isolation. There are very

few, if any, genuine "breakthroughs" in science or medicine. Yet too often

researchers are pressed into implying, and journalists into reporting, that

breakthroughs have been made--as one researcher told me, scientists, like

everyone else, are driven by ego. But as a rule it is the gradual accumulation

of evidence that leads to scientific understanding. It is up to the public to

stop expecting miracles and to maintain an open but critical mind.<p>

	<center><i><font size=4>Though it is commonly believed that American health-care delivery and research

benefit men at the expense of women, the truth appears to be exactly the

opposite</i></font></center><p>

	

	<pre>



	</pre>

	

	

	<font size=5>"W</font>hen it comes to health-care research and delivery, women can no longer be

treated as second-class citizens." So said the President of the United States

on October 18, 1993.<p>



<p>



He and the First Lady had just hosted a reception for the National Breast

Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group, after receiving a petition containing 2.6

million signatures which demanded increased funding for breast-cancer

prevention and treatment. While the Clintons met with leaders of the group in

the East Room of the White House, a thousand demonstrators rallied across the

street in support. The President echoed their call, decrying the neglect of

medical care for women.<p>



<p>



Two years earlier Bernadine Healy, then the director of the National Institutes

of Health, charged that "women have all too often been treated less than

equally in . . . health care." More recently Representative Pat Schroeder, a

co-chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, sponsored legislation

to "ensure that biomedical research does not once again overlook women and

their health." Newspaper articles expressed similar sentiments.<p>



<p>



The list of accusations is long and startling. Women's-health-care advocates

indict "sex-biased" doctors for stereotyping women as hysterical

hypochondriacs, for taking women's complaints less seriously than men's, and

for giving them less thorough diagnostic workups. A study conducted at the

University of California at San Diego in 1979 concluded that men's complaints

of back pain, chest pain, dizziness, fatigue, and headache more often resulted

in extensive workups than did similar complaints from women. Hard scientific

evidence therefore seemed to confirm women's anecdotal reports.<p>



<p>



Men more often than women undergo angiographies and

coronary-artery-bypass-graft operations. Even though heart disease is the No. 1

killer of women as well as men, this sophisticated, state-of-the-art

technology, critics contend, is selectively denied to women.<p>



<p>



The problem is said to be repeated in medical research: women, critics argue,

are routinely ignored in favor of men. When the NIH inventoried all the

research it had funded in 1987, the money spent on studying diseases unique to

women amounted to only 13.5 percent of the total research budget.<p>



<p>



Perhaps the most emotionally charged disease for women is breast cancer. If a

tumor devastated men on a similar scale, critics say, we would declare a state

of national emergency and launch a no-cost-barred Apollo Project-style program

to cure it. In the words of Matilda Cuomo, the wife of the governor of New

York, "If we can send a woman to the moon, we can surely find a cure for breast

cancer." The neglect of breast-cancer research, we have been told, is both

sexist and a national disgrace.<p>



<p>



Nearly all heart-disease research is said to be conducted on men, with the

conclusions blindly generalized to women. In July of 1989 researchers from the

Harvard Medical School reported the results of a five-year study on the effects

of aspirin in preventing cardiovascular disease in 22,071 male physicians.

Thousands of men were studied, but not one woman: women's health, critics

charge, was obviously not considered important enough to explore similarly.

Here, they say, we have definite, smoking-gun evidence of the neglect of women

in medical research--only one example of a widespread, dangerous phenomenon.<p>



<p>



Still another difference: pharmaceutical companies make a policy of giving new

drugs to men first, while women wait to benefit from the advances. And even

then the medicines are often inadequately tested on women.<p>



<p>



To remedy all this neglect, we need to devote preferential attention and funds,

in the words of the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association, to

"the greatest resource this country will ever have, namely, the health of its

women." Discrimination on such a large scale cries out for restitution--if the

charges are true.<p>



<p>



In fact one sex does appear to be favored in the amount of attention devoted to

its medical needs. In the United States it is estimated that one sex spends

twice as much money on health care as the other does. The NIH also spends twice

as much money on research into the diseases specific to one sex as it does on

research into those specific to the other, and only one sex has a section of

the NIH devoted entirely to the study of diseases afflicting it. That sex is

not men, however. It is women.<p>



<p><br>



<font size=5>I</font>N the United States women seek out and consequently receive more medical care

than men. This is true even if pregnancy-related care is excluded. Department

of Health and Human Services surveys show that women visit doctors more often

than men, are hospitalized more often, and undergo more operations. Women are

more likely than men to visit a doctor for a general physical exam when they

are feeling well, and complain of symptoms more often. Thus two out of every

three health-care dollars are spent by women.<p>



<p>



Quantity, of course, does not guarantee quality. Do women receive second-rate

diagnostic workups?<p>



<p>



The 1979 San Diego study, which concluded that men's complaints more often led

to extensive workups than did women's, used the charts of 104 men and women

(fifty-two married couples) as data. This small-scale regional survey prompted

a more extensive national review of 46,868 office visits. The results, reported

in 1981, were quite different from those of the San Diego study.<p>



<p>



In this larger, more representative sample, the care received by men and women

was similar about two thirds of the time. When the care was different, women

overall received more diagnostic tests and treatment--more lab tests,

blood-pressure checks, drug prescriptions, and return appointments.<p>



<p>



Several other, small-scale studies have weighed in on both sides of this issue.

The San Diego researchers looked at another 200 men and women in 1984, and this

time found "no significant differences in the extent and content" of workups.

Some women's-health-care advocates have chosen to ignore data from the second

San Diego study and the national survey while touting the first study as

evidence that doctors, to quote once again from the Journal of the American

Medical Women's Association, do "not take complaints as seriously" when they

come from women: "an example of a double standard influencing diagnostic

workups."<p>



<p>



When prescribing care for heart disease, doctors consider such factors as age,

other medical problems, and the likelihood that the patient will benefit from

testing and surgery. Coronary-artery disease afflicts men at a much younger

age, killing them three times as often as women until age sixty-five. Younger

patients have fewer additional medical problems that preclude aggressive,

high-risk procedures. And smaller patients have smaller coronary arteries,

which become obstructed more often after surgery. Whereas this is true for both

sexes, obviously more women fit into the smaller-patient category. When these

differences are factored in, sex divergence in cardiac care begins to fade

away.<p>



<p>



To the extent that divergence remains, women may be getting better treatment.

At least that was the conclusion of a University of North Carolina/Duke

University study that looked at the records of 5,795 patients treated from 1969

to 1984. The most symptomatic and severely diseased men and women were equally

likely to be referred for bypass surgery. Among the patients with less-severe

disease--the ones to whom surgery offers little or no survival benefit over

medical therapy--women were less likely to be scheduled for bypass surgery.

This seems proper in light of the greater risk of surgical complications, owing

to women's smaller coronary arteries. In fact, the researchers questioned the

wisdom of surgery in the less symptomatic men and suggested that "the effect of

gender on treatment selection may have led to more appropriate treatment of

women."<p>



<p>



As for sophisticated, pioneering technology selectively designed for the

benefit of one sex, laparoscopic surgery was largely confined to gynecology for

more than twenty years. Using viewing and manipulating instruments that can be

inserted into the abdomen through keyhole-sized incisions, doctors are able to

diagnose and repair, sparing the patient a larger incision and a longer, more

painful recuperation. Laparoscopic tubal sterilization, first performed in

1936, became common practice in the late 1960s. Over time the development of

more-versatile instruments and of fiber-optic video capability made possible

the performance of more-complex operations. The laparoscopic removal of ectopic

pregnancy was reported in 1973. Finally, in 1987, the same technology was

applied in gallbladder surgery, and men began to enjoy its benefits too.<p>



<p>



Years after ultrasound instruments were designed to look inside the uterus, the

same technology was adapted to search for tumors in the prostate. Other

pioneering developments conceived to improve the health care of women include

mammography, bone-density testing for osteoporosis, surgery to alleviate

bladder incontinence, hormone therapy to relieve the symptoms of menopause, and

a host of procedures, including in vitro fertilization, developed to facilitate

impregnation. Perhaps so many new developments occur in women's health care

because one branch of medicine and a group of doctors, gynecologists, are

explicitly concerned with the health of women. No corresponding group of

doctors is dedicated to the care of men.<p>



<p>



So women receive more care than men, sometimes receive better care than men,

and benefit more than men do from some developing technologies. This hardly

looks like proof that women's health is viewed as secondary in importance to

men's health.<p>



<p><br>



<font size=5>T</font>HE 1987 NIH inventory did indeed find that only 13.5 percent of the NIH

research budget was devoted to studying diseases unique to women. But 80

percent of the budget went into research for the benefit of both sexes,

including basic research in fields such as genetics and immunology and also

research into diseases such as lymphoma, arthritis, and sickle-cell anemia.

Both men and women suffer from these ailments, and both sexes served as study

subjects. The remaining 6.5 percent of NIH research funds were devoted to

afflictions unique to men. Oddly, the women's 13.5 percent has been cited as

evidence of neglect. The much smaller men's share of the budget is rarely

mentioned in these references.<p>



<p>



As for breast cancer, the second most lethal malignancy in females,

investigation in that field has long received more funding from the National

Cancer Institute than any other tumor research, though lung cancer heads the

list of fatal tumors for both sexes. The second most lethal malignancy in males

is also a sex-specific tumor: prostate cancer. Last year approximately 46,000

women succumbed to breast cancer and 35,000 men to prostate cancer; the NCI

spent $213.7 million on breast-cancer research and $51.1 million on study of

the prostate. Thus although about a third more women died of breast cancer than

men of prostate cancer, breast-cancer research received more than four times

the funding. More than three times as much money per fatality was spent on the

women's disease. Breast cancer accounted for 8.8 percent of cancer fatalities

in the United States and for 13 percent of the NCI research budget; the

corresponding figures for prostate cancer were 6.7 percent of fatalities and

three percent of the funding. The spending for breast-cancer research is

projected to increase by 23 percent this year, to $262.9 million;

prostate-research spending will increase by 7.6 percent, to $55 million.<p>



<p>



The female cancers of the cervix and the uterus accounted for 10,100 deaths and

$48.5 million in research last year, and ovarian cancer accounted for 13,300

deaths and $32.5 million in research. Thus the research funding for all

female-specific cancers is substantially larger per fatality than the funding

for prostate cancer.<p>



<p>



Is this level of spending on women's health just a recent development, needed

to make up for years of prior neglect? The NCI is divided into sections dealing

with issues such as cancer biology and diagnosis, prevention and control,

etiology, and treatment. Until funding allocations for sex-specific concerns

became a political issue, in the mid-1980s, the NCI did not track

organ-specific spending data. The earliest information now available was

reconstructed retroactively to 1981. Nevertheless, these early data provide a

window on spending patterns in the era before political pressure began to

intensify for more research on women. Each year from 1981 to 1985 funding for

breast-cancer research exceeded funding for prostate cancer by a ratio of

roughly five to one. A rational, nonpolitical explanation for this is that

breast cancer attacks a larger number of patients, at a younger age. In any

event, the data fail to support claims that women were neglected in that era.<p>



<p>



Again, most medical research is conducted on diseases that afflict both sexes.

Women's-health advocates charge that we collect data from studies of men and

then extrapolate to women. A look at the actual data reveals a different

reality.<p>



<p>



The best-known and most ambitious study of cardiovascular health over time

began in the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, in 1948. Researchers started

with 2,336 men and 2,873 women aged thirty to sixty-two, and have followed the

survivors of this group with biennial physical exams and lab tests for more

than forty-five years. In this and many other observational studies women have

been well represented.<p>



<p>



With respect to the aspirin study, the researchers at Harvard Medical School

did not focus exclusively on men. Both sexes were studied nearly concurrently.

The men's study was more rigorous, because it was placebo-controlled (that is,

some subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebos instead of aspirin);

the women's study was based on responses to questionnaires sent to nurses and a

review of medical records. The women's study, however, followed nearly four

times as many subjects as the men's study (87,678 versus 22,071), and it

followed its subjects for a year longer (six versus five) than the men's study

did. The results of the men's study were reported in the New England Journal of

Medicine in July of 1989 and prompted charges of sexism in medical research.

The women's-study results were printed in the Journal of the American Medical

Association in July of 1991, and were generally ignored by the nonmedical

press.<p>



<p>



Most studies on the prevention of "premature" (occurring in people under age

sixty-five) coronary-artery disease have, in fact, been conducted on men. Since

middle-aged women have a much lower incidence of this illness than their male

counterparts (they provide less than a third as many cases), documenting the

preventive effect of a given treatment in these women is much more difficult.

More experiments were conducted on men not because women were considered less

important but because women suffer less from this disease. Older women do

develop coronary disease (albeit at a lower rate than older men), but the

experiments were not performed on older men either. At most the data suggest an

emphasis on the prevention of disease in younger people.<p>



<p>



Incidentally, all clinical breast-cancer research currently funded by the NCI

is being conducted on women, even though 300 men a year die of this tumor. Do

studies on the prevention of breast cancer which specifically exclude males

signify a neglect of men's health? Or should a disease be studied in the group

most at risk? Obviously, the coronary-disease research situation and the

breast-cancer research situation are not equivalent, but together they do serve

to illustrate a point: diseases are most often studied in the highest-risk

group, regardless of sex.<p>



<p>



What about all the new drug tests that exclude women? Don't they prove the

pharmaceutical industry's insensitivity to and disregard for females?<p>



<p>



The Food and Drug Administration divides human testing of new medicines into

three stages. Phase 1 studies are done on a small number of volunteers over a

brief period of time, primarily to test safety. Phase 2 studies typically

involve a few hundred patients and are designed to look more closely at safety

and effectiveness. Phase 3 tests precede approval for commercial release and

generally include several thousand patients.<p>



<p>



In 1977 the FDA issued guidelines that specifically excluded women with

"childbearing potential" from phase 1 and early phase 2 studies; they were to

be included in late phase 2 and phase 3 trials in proportion to their expected

use of the medication. FDA surveys conducted in 1983 and 1988 showed that the

two sexes had been proportionally represented in clinical trials by the time

drugs were approved for release.<p>



<p>



The 1977 guidelines codified a policy already informally in effect since the

thalidomide tragedy shocked the world in 1962. The births of armless or

otherwise deformed babies in that era dramatically highlighted the special

risks incurred when fertile women ingest drugs. So the policy of excluding such

women from the early phases of drug testing arose out of concern, not out of

disregard, for them. The policy was changed last year, as a consequence of

political protest and recognition that early studies in both sexes might better

direct testing.<p>



<p><br>



<font size=5>T</font>HROUGHOUT human history from antiquity until the beginning of this century

men, on the average, lived slightly longer than women. By 1920 women's life

expectancy in the United States was one year greater than men's (54.6 years

versus 53.6). After that the gap increased steadily, to 3.5 years in 1930, 4.4

years in 1940, 5.5 in 1950, 6.5 in 1960, and 7.7 in 1970. For the past quarter

of a century the gap has remained relatively steady: around seven years. In

1990 the figure was seven years (78.8 versus 71.8).<p>



<p>



Thus in the latter part of the twentieth century women live about 10 percent

longer than men. A significant part of the reason for this is medical care.<p>



<p>



In past centuries complications during childbirth were a major cause of

traumatic death in women. Medical advances have dramatically eliminated most of

this risk. Infections such as smallpox, cholera, and tuberculosis killed large

numbers of men and women at similar ages. The elimination of infection as the

dominant cause of death has boosted the prominence of diseases that selectively

afflict men earlier in life.<p>



<p>



Age-adjusted mortality rates for men are higher for all twelve leading causes

of death, including heart disease, stroke, cancer, lung disease (emphysema and

pneumonia), liver disease (cirrhosis), suicide, and homicide. We have come to

accept women's longer life span as natural, the consequence of their greater

biological fitness. Yet this greater fitness never manifested itself in all the

millennia of human history that preceded the present era and its medical-care

system--the same system that women's-health advocates accuse of neglecting the

female sex.<p>



<p>



To remedy the alleged neglect, an Office of Research on Women's Health was

established by the NIH in 1990. In 1991 the NIH launched its largest

epidemiological project ever, the Women's Health Initiative. Costing more than

$600 million, this fifteen-year program will study the effects of estrogen

therapy, diet, dietary supplements, and exercise on heart disease, breast

cancer, colon cancer, osteoporosis, and other diseases in 160,000

postmenopausal women. The study is ambitious in scope and may well result in

many advances in the care of older women.<p>



<p>



What it will not do is close the "medical gender gap," the difference in the

quality of care given the two sexes. The reason is that the gap does not favor

men. As we have seen, women receive more medical care and benefit more from

medical research. The net result is the most important gap of all: seven years,

10 percent of life.<p>

<font size=3><b>CULLEN MURPHY<br>



Managing Editor</b></font><p>







<p>

<br)

<p>

October 20, 1995<p>



<blockquote>



<p><br><p><br>



<font size=5>W</font><font size=4>elcome to the World Wide Web site of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> magazine.<p>



<p>



All forms of communication are a marriage of content and medium, and the

interplay between the two necessarily evolves over time. Even in its long

incarnation--138 years this month--as an object printed on paper, the magazine

has metamorphosed in appearance in many ways, as all magazines do. In the

second half of the nineteenth century advertising was added to <i>The

Atlantic</i>'s pages. In the twentieth century illustrations began to

supplement the printed text and to adorn the cover. The size of the magazine

grew from that associated with a literary journal to that associated with

mainstream general-interest magazines. Content, too, has changed, with more

emphasis on in-depth reporting and analysis of public affairs to complement the

magazine's traditionally strong literature and criticism.<p>



<p>



<i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> on the World Wide Web represents yet another

natural progression, as we strive to make the contents of the print magazine as

easily accessible as possible to as many people as possible. In many respects

there can be no real substitute for the print magazine itself, as far as it

goes; the basic technology, like that of books, seems as admirably suited to

the needs of the human form as are trousers or gloves. But the words "as far as

it goes" are important: electronic media obviously can do a great many things

that print alone cannot. <i>The Atlantic</i> on the Web, we hope, will offer

ample demonstration of that fact, while maintaining the same high standards

that our print readers have come to expect.<p></blockquote>

<font size=5>S</font>omeday Joni Mitchell will release an indispensable boxed set. Until then we can
buy either her back catalogue or <i>Hits </i>and <i>Misses</i> (Reprise), two
CDs that visit, respectively, the high points of her three-decade recording
career and some equally high but lesser-known points. Mitchell seems to have
been born an old soul, possessed of a Zen-like knowledge that everything
changes with perspective and time, and all we can do is hold on to our memories
until they change too. That she arrived at this insight as a full participant
in the Dionysian frenzy of the sixties probably explains why her album sales
have never quite lived up to her considerable reputation. She was haunted
by loss and mortality when everyone else in her generation was grabbing for the
gusto. Now that all the other Baby Boomers are haunted by loss and mortality,
her songs take on an almost unbearable poignance. If you haven't listened to
"Woodstock" for a while, try turning out the lights and putting on the
headphones. It's just Joni and her electric piano and the idealism of a
generation in all its courage and naivet&eacute;. Chills and misty eyes are
guaranteed. Mitchell's other great talent as a lyricist is her wonderful knack
for weaving in political themes without coming off as didactic or overly
earnest. When she sings a line like "They paved paradise/And put up a parking
lot" in the upbeat "Big Yellow Taxi," you want to sing along and tap your foot.
Only afterward, upon reflection, are you blasted by that old loss and
mortality. Finally, Mitchell has always had the musical imagination to frame
her lyrics. Whether accompanying herself with her idiosyncratic guitar picking
or working with the best jazz musicians in the world, she has never gone for
the obvious note. Just the right one.<b>

	<font size=5>I</font>t is nice to come upon seasonal music
that was not simply thrown together for quick December sales. <i>Blessed
Quietness: A Collection of Hymns, Spirituals and Carols</i> (Atlantic), the
first solo collection from 
<A HREF="http://atlantic-records.com/Cyrus_Chestnut/Bio.HTML">Cyrus Chestnut</A>, is far from the usual jazz versions
of sacred tunes. Chestnut's style is grounded in the Baptist Church, so the
material here is as basic to him as "I Got Rhythm." When he eases "Jesus Loves
Me" into stride, or adds a pastel interlude to "Silent Night," he is working
from the heart rather than straining for variation.<p>

More-secular musical Christmas presents often come in boxed sets, like
<i>Dexter Gordon: The Complete Blue Note Sixties Sessions</i> (Blue Note). The
tenor saxophonist Gordon (1923-1990) was a jazzman with several lives,
including bebop innovator in the 1940s, leader of the expatriate renaissance in
the 1970s, and unlikely Oscar nominee (for the film <i>'Round Midnight</i>) in
the 1980s. His most creative playing, however, took place in 1961 following a
decade of obscurity. This six-CD set, which covers 1961-1965, is filled with
Gordon's commanding tenor in such classic sessions as <i>Go</i> (with the
pianist Sonny Clark) and <i>Our Man in Paris</i> (with Bud Powell). The
accompanying booklet contains extensive correspondence between Gordon and the
Blue Note office, and provides a portrait of a hip charmer which, like the
music, is far more representative than the dissipated has-been captured in
Gordon's cinema triumph.<b>

	<font size=5>F</font>rom the Beatles to the Police, England produced an amazingly high percentage of
the best rock-and-roll bands in the world. Since the early eighties, however,
the country has produced almost no one great. Oasis has generated a huge
following there and a respectable one here by combining derivative melodies
with vocals that fall halfway between John Lennon and Johnny Rotten, but no one
would accuse them of having anything to say. 
<A HREF="http://www.kulashaker.co.uk/main.html">Kula Shaker</A> may be just the band
to put England--and India--back on the musical map. Deeply influenced by Hindu
mythology, they create tightly constructed songs out of trancy whirlwinds of
psychedelia and tribal drumming. Their lyrics are about the nature of illusion
and reality, some of them sung in Sanskrit--certainly a rare occurrence in pop
music. Also rare among new English bands in these days of rave: they can play
their instruments and keep the special effects in the service of the song. The
juxtaposition of eerie Indian scales with the drive of rock-and-roll seems far
more integrated than when it was first tried, in the sixties.<b>

	<font size=5>C</font>hances are as you read this article
there is a production of <i>The Nutcracker</i> somewhere in your vicinity.
Choose whatever metaphor you like--warhorse, cash cow, goose that lays golden
eggs--this ballet, in all its various guises from the elaborate to the
touchingly makeshift, sells tickets. Run <i>The Nutcracker</i> for a few
days (or weeks or months), the reasoning goes, and you can afford to present
more-esoteric fare come spring. In fact a number of <i>Nut</i>s are themselves
esoteric: Nureyev's is creepily psychological, Mark Morris's hilariously
contrarian. But to my mind, the very familiarity of the ballet is the draw,
although one can certainly sympathize with the stagehands and musicians and
performers who, along with certain jaded members of the public, feel like
fleeing from the room as the curtain rises yet again. Nonetheless, it is at
just that moment, out in the dark of the auditorium, that some of us are
settling in our seats, preferably with a little one at our side; this is, after
all, an entertainment for families. Ideally one would always go with one's
grandmother, and indeed it was with his own granny in mind that Donald Byrd
fashioned his newfangled yet old-fashioned <i>The Harlem Nutcracker</i>.
(Donald Byrd/The Group: Northrop Auditorium, Minneapolis, December 4-7;
Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York City, 11-15; University Musical Society,
Ann Arbor, Michigan, 18-21; Wiltern Theater, Los Angeles, 27-29.) And so he has
made Clara (the little girl who receives the Nutcracker as a Christmas gift,
setting the whole plot in motion) herself a matriarch who recalls her youth
during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s. Rather than the traditional
Tchaikovsky score, Byrd has used Duke Ellington's thirty-five-minute
arrangement, amplified by the composer David Berger's gospel interludes and
additional Ellington-style material. Another period <i>Nutcracker</i> is my own
favorite: Robert Joffrey's exceptionally beautiful Valentine-card vision of
Victorian America, circa 1850. Himself an acknowledged "Christmas nut," the
late choreographer adored everything about the holiday season. This exquisitely
rendered and merry production features local children in charming cameo roles
at all of its stops on tour, and local orchestras as well. (The Joffrey Ballet
of Chicago: Rosemont Theatre, Chicago, November 25-December 8; Hancher
Auditorium, Iowa City, December 9-15; Orange County Center for the Performing
Arts, Costa Mesa, December 23-29.)   <b>--N.D.</b><p>

	<font size=5>F</font>arce: it is a funny genre. . . By literary standards, Moli&egrave;re's
<i>Scapin</i> is no gem, but as a springboard for clowning, it still has lots
of bounce. What's it about? Fathers and children, servants and masters (Scapin
is one of the former), marriage plans run amok--if anyone tries to elaborate,
run for your life. Know, though, that Bill Irwin has lately taken up the
knockabout French classic for an eagerly awaited Broadway revival by the
Roundabout Theatre Company (December 4-March 9; 212-869-8400). Irwin, whose
loose-limbed antics have won him a MacArthur "genius" award, has in his time
toyed with the idea of playing Hamlet. But lots of others are in line for the
Dane's inky cloak and suits of solemn black, and so far our true-begotten bozo
has found no takers. Which leaves him free for such happy tasks as directing
and starring as the scamp who pulls the strings in what promises to be a
side-splitting show.     <b>--A.B.</b><p>

	<font size=5>F</font>ilm buffs will remember <i>Whistle Down the Wind</i>
	 (1961) as a minor classic
that explores the contradictory realities of kids and grown-ups. Three children
rescue three kittens from drowning and hide them in their father's barn. Next
morning they discover a bearded stranger there, asleep in the hay. In context
it does not seem all that far-fetched for them to mistake him for Jesus.
(Shortly, in a wondrous touch of magic realism, they are dancing over a
hillside to the jaunty soundtrack accompaniment of "We Three Kings.") In fact,
though, the man is wanted for murder. The circumstances of his crime
are never revealed, nor is he seen to do any harm. When the law catches up with
him, he goes gently. Mute and disconsolate, the children witness his capture.
Mawkish as the tale may sound in the retelling, on the screen it has a
disarming and at times blunt innocence. Perhaps that quality will survive in
the new Broadway-bound Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, directed by Harold Prince,
which transposes the action from bleak black-and-white Lancashire to a
Louisiana backwater; it receives its world premiere this month at the National
Theatre, in Washington, D.C. (December 6-February 9; 800-447-7400).

<font size=5>B</font>ased on the troubled life of Australian concert pianist David Helfgott, Scott
Hicks's playful <i>Shine </i>steers clear of the linear arc of conventional
biopics while maintaining a broad accessibility that won the movie top prizes
from both the press and the public at the 1996 Toronto Film Festival. The movie
darts back and forth in time, mimicking the structure of a concerto as it
traces the roots of David's emotionally unstable adulthood to his unhappy youth
under the repressive wing of his ambitious father (Armin Mueller-Stahl), a
Polish-Jewish refugee whose rigidity is outstripped only by devotion to an
abstract idea of family unity that cripples his sensitive son. Escaping England
to study under the legendary music teacher Cecil Parkes (John Gielgud), David
suffers a complete collapse after a triumphant performance and returns to a
life spent in and out of mental institutions in Australia. Brilliant
 performances by Noah Taylor (<i>The Year My Voice Broke</i>) as the young David
and Geoffrey Rush as the adult David convey not only his nerdy pathos but also
the hyperkinetic charm that drew so many kind people to him, including the
astrologer (Lynn Redgrave) who helped to salvage his life and career. Jan
Sardi's screenplay, though witty, presses almost every line of dialogue into
the service of a simplistic master narrative--damaged father produces damaged
son--that stops this touching, expert, and often wildly funny movie just short
of greatness. Still, one is left hungering for a sequel that chronicles the
astonishing match between David and his astrologer.<p> <br>

<font size=5>T</font>he extraordinarily imaginative Danish
filmmaker Lars Von Trier (<i>Zentropa</i>, <i>The Kingdom</i>) makes his bid
for the mainstream with <i>Breaking the Waves</i>, the story of a remarkable
marriage between Bess (Emily Watson), an impish woman who dwells just this
side of sanity in an austere Calvinist community on the Scottish coast, and
Jan (Swedish actor Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd), a worldly oil-rig worker who 
falls in love with Bess's trusting innocence. When Jan is brought home paralyzed
by terrible injuries from an accident at sea, he persuades his young bride to
"aid his recovery" by taking other lovers (and regaling him with the details),
in the hope that she will thus lead the normal life he can no longer offer her.
The acting is superb (Katrin Cartlidge, last seen in <i>Before the Rain</i>, is
especially good as Bess's loving but bossy sister-in-law), and the movie,
exquisitely shot with a hand-held camera by the gifted cinematographer Robby
M&uuml;ller, also has a score that will thrill fans of early-seventies pop. Yet
before long it becomes clear that all this talent is being poured into kitschy
romantic melodrama, for Bess becomes the tiresome child-whore-saint icon that
excites the fantasies of all too many male filmmakers. She's Mary Magdalene in
hot pants, and after the hundredth shot of her guileless saucer eyes and
beatifically parted lips smudged by tarty lipstick, I was overcome by an urge
to do the unthinkable--throw popcorn at a saint and head for the exit.<p> <br>

<font size=5>A</font>lthough it's set in eighteenth-century Versailles and littered with giant wigs,
Patrice Leconte's new movie is in no sense a regulation period picture.
Newcomer Charles Berling plays Gregoire Ponceludon de Malavoy, a mildly
blue-blooded, idealistic young engineer who arrives on Louis XVI's doorstep to
beg for resources to drain the mosquito-infested swamps of his home region and
so save his countrymen from disease. Once at court the naive Gregoire gets
sucked into the rotting culture of an aristocracy in decline, where neither
sincerity nor decency but wit and the ability to ridicule others open doors to
the few favors the King has left to bestow. Caught between his love for
Mathilde (Judith Godreche), a free-spirited young scientist raised on Rousseau,
and the attentions of a conniving courtesan (a majestic Fanny Ardant), Gregoire
struggles between means and ends until he realizes he's being used. Leconte's
most ambitious work to date, <i>Ridicule</i> is a film of ideas, ripe with
the moral passion of good historical drama and speckled with both the
precisely placed venom of Restoration comedy and the waggish antics to be
expected from the versatile director of <i>The Hairdresser's Husband</i> and
<i>Monsieur Hire</i>. By the time Gregoire rises from a final humiliation to
tell the court that the Voltaire they quote so liberally is, unlike them,
"ridiculously compassionate," you're as primed as France was for the revolution
just around the corner.<p>

In retrospect, the year 1965 is one in which the fulcrum of nationaldestiny held in equal balance a lingering optimism and a gathering despair.<em>The Secular City</em>, which celebrated the unprecedented freedom availableto human beings in an urban context where traditional religion no longerreigned, and which urged people to search for "a nonreligious interpretation ofbiblical concepts," fell on the optimistic side in its conception of thefuture, a future in which rational human beings at last seemed capable oftaking competent control. It became one of the most surprising best sellers ofthe 1960s, and now enjoys the status of a cultural milestone. But as Harvey Coxhimself acknowledges in his most recent book, <em>Fire From Heaven</em> (1994), asurvey of the rapidly growing Pentecostal movements around the world, his firstbook holds up better, at least in the short term, as a prospectus than as aprophecy. "Today," he writes, "it is secularity, not spirituality, that may beheaded for extinction." That sentiment is the subtext of Cox's article in thisissue, which examines the robust growth of Pat Robertson's Regent University, aschool that embodies conservative Christianity in America.<p>The hallmark of Harvey Cox is the honesty that governs how he reports what hesees--that, and his engagement with some of the basic issues that confront theworld. He has labored on relief operations with the United Nations. He wasjailed for his activities in the early days of the civil-rights movement. Hehas been among the foremost advocates of communication between adherents of theworld's major religions, and in that cause has spoken to countlesscongregations and university audiences, on every continent save Antarctica. Atthe same time, Cox has pursued a career as a "public theologian" in thetradition of Reinhold Niebuhr, publishing a dozen books aimed primarily at anonacademic audience.<p>In the months ahead the term "religious right" will be wielded often inshorthand fashion to refer to a factor that figures significantly in nationalpolitics. It is indeed a significant factor. But, as Harvey Cox's article helpsto explain, it does not figure in a single, predictable way.   --THE EDITORS</blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

The noise level was heightened in 1993 by the turmoil that swirledaround Professor Tony Martin, of Wellesley College. A tenured professor inWellesley's Department of Africana Studies, Martin assigned to one of hisclasses portions of the book, which singles out Jews for special prominence in<AHREF="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/African_Studies/Articles_Gen/Atlantic_Slave_18139.html">the Atlantic slave trade</A> and for having played a particularlyprominent role in the enslavement of Africans in the Americas. He was accused of anti-Semitism,and wrote a brief book to refute the charges. The title of Martin's book,<i>The Jewish Onslaught: Despatches From the Wellesley Battlefront</i>, gave aclear preview of his opinions. It was a mixture of discussion, factualrefutation, and angry recrimination. This last predominated, with paragraphsthat opened using language like "To the Jews, and to their favourite Negroeswho have insisted on attacking me I say . . ." His views on <i>The SecretRelationship</i>'s use of historical materials amounted to a barrage ofenthusiastic endorsements. Ironically, Martin's assertion that "Jews were verymuch in the mainstream of European society as far as the trade in African humanbeings was concerned" was very close to what many Jewish scholars had claimedsome thirty years before.<p>Martin, in one of his endorsements, made a startling assertion concerning slaveownership by Jews: "Using the research of Jewish historians, the book suggeststhat based on the 1830 census, Jews actually had a higher per capita slaveownership than for the white population as a whole." <i>The SecretRelationship</i> does in fact approach making that suggestion, and since theclaim would appear to be a pivotal one, it is worth examining. <p>In order to assess such a claim, one must resort to details. Martin's purportedactuality is wrong on its face if applied to the "white population" of theUnited States "as a whole," because in 1830 only a handful of white northernersstill owned slaves. Jews were concentrated in the North, and they constituted avery small minority there. Even if the statement is taken as applying only tothe states in the American South that had not adopted gradual emancipationlaws, it remains badly flawed. A careful and honest footnote in <i>The SecretRelationship </i>reveals that "Jewish scholars" had concluded that Jews in theSouth lived mostly in towns and cities. Neither this book nor Martin's explainsthe significance of this fact. In actuality, slave ownership was much morecommon in southern urban areas than in the southern countryside. The relativelyhigh proportion of Jewish slaveholding was a function of the concentration ofJews in cities and towns, not of their descent or religion. It is also the casethat urban slaveholders of whatever background owned fewer slaves on averagethan rural slaveholders, including those on large plantations. Thus theproportion of slaveholders has never been an accurate measure of the social oreconomic importance of slaveholding, unless it is assessed on a broadlyregional or state-by-state basis. In this instance, as in so many others, thestatistical data do not stand up and cry out their own true significance.<p><i>The Secret Relationship</i> is interesting in many respects. It has anunnamed editor and provides no indication of personal authorship. The titlepage declares that it was "Prepared by The Historical Research Department [of]The Nation of Islam," but does not explain why this is "Volume One" or what maybe offered in ensuing volumes. The book is ostensibly a scholarly work, repletewith a short bibliography and a huge collection of footnotes. Its opening "Noteon Sources" asserts that it "has been compiled primarily from Jewish historicalliterature."<p>A second title page of <i>The Secret Relationship</i> announces that "Blacksand Jews have recently begun to question their relationship and its strategicrole in their individual development" and that the book "is intended to providean historical perspective for intellectual debate of this crucial socialmatter." The word "individual" raises the question whether persons or groupsare intended. Individual African-Americans and individual Jews as persons? Ortwo distinct individual groups? <p>As for the mechanics of scholarship, they present a central difficulty. Thefootnotes are extremely difficult to check in the form in which they arepresented: although they follow the custom (in common with most of thehumanities but not the social sciences) of providing a complete citation uponfirst mention and a shortened author-title-page version for ensuing ones, andare placed at the bottom of the page, they are numbered consecutively--all1,275 of them--rather than starting afresh with each chapter. A readerencountering a brief reference to a presumably important article on Jewishslaveholding in the South (such as one on page 304, in footnote No. 1,238) canfind a fuller citation--on page 91, in footnote No. 349--only after nearly anhour of thumbing through the book. Having gone this far, the reader must thenconsult the "Footnote Abbreviations" at the beginning of the book in order todiscover a reference that might be usable in a library. The citation names athree-volume work edited by Abraham J. Karp. Upon consulting that work, whichactually has five volumes, one learns that the article in question is byBertram W. Korn. The same article by Korn is listed in <i>The SecretRelationship</i>'s "Selected Bibliography," but in another set of volumes, withan incorrect date and no indication that it was reprinted elsewhere severaltimes.<p>Footnotes matter because verifiability depends on them. In the Karp-Korninstance we are nearly home, though we do not yet know when the article waspublished--and, of course, the date matters greatly. We can determine it onlyby consulting actual copies of the article, which turns out to be "Jews andNegro Slavery in the Old South, 1789-1865," which originated as an address bythe president of the American Jewish Historical Society and was first publishedin 1961.<p>The date, it turns out, falls within a period when Jewish scholarship about thehistory of Jews in the United States was moving away from predominantlyfiliopietistic studies of ancestry and achievement and toward a moresophisticated assessment of the role of Jews in American culture. Korn'sarticle contains a great deal of specific information to which <i>The SecretRelationship</i> has been thoroughly faithful. Overall, though, the conclusionsKorn drew from his data were very different: he made a strong and persuasivecase that there were few Jews in the planting class in the South, that Jews hadhistorically been forced into commercial enterprises, that in the Old Souththey were typically city dwellers, that a small number participated in thedomestic slave trade, that they treated their slaves no better or worse thanother slaveholders, and that the few Jews in the South without exceptionendorsed slavery. The thrust of Korn's article was that Jews were not muchdifferent from other white southerners in their views on race and slavery.<p>Dating such historical writing is critical, given the shifting state ofhistorical scholarship over time. Many of the works cited in <i>The SecretRelationship </i>are so old that it would be generous to call them outdated. Ofthe first sixty-odd, nearly a third date from before 1950 and eight from the1890s. In contrast, a recent pamphlet on the Atlantic slave trade that waspublished by the American Historical Association as an aid to scholars andteachers cites four sources that date from 1949 through the late 1960s andtwenty-eight published since 1970.<p><font size=5>Y</font>ET surely the compilers of <i>The Secret Relationship</i>will feel that such disparities merely confirm their case--that by avoiding these older historicalwritings, the history establishment has been hiding the facts about theimportant role played by Jews in the enslavement of Africans and theirdescendants in the New World. The AHA pamphlet does not, in fact, even mentionJews. The compilers will no doubt take this omission as further confirmationthat the participation of Jews has been kept a secret.A more serious difficulty with <i>The Secret Relationship</i> lies in itsgeneral stance toward historical evidence. The compilers assumed that the bookwould be most persuasive if it were based almost entirely on "Jewishsources"--that is, retrospective histories written by Jews--and that therewould be general agreement with the proposition that each group can mostpersuasively write its own history, a proposition that most historians findeither naive or dangerous or both. On occasion this strategy deprives <i>TheSecret Relationship</i> of evidence that would have bolstered its case, as withestimates of the total number of Africans killed by the Atlantic slave trade.The compilers cite figures gathered by both Jewish and non-Jewish Westernhistorians but ignore the higher estimates claimed by Joseph Inikori, anestablished scholar from Nigeria. <p>The compilers have avoided another distinction that most historians regard ascrucial--that between primary sources, written at the time, and secondary ones,written later on the basis of the primary sources. The evidence presented inthe footnotes consists almost entirely of secondary historical accounts,written mostly by Jews and often in the late nineteenth and early twentiethcenturies, when Jews newly arrived from Europe were trying to establishthemselves as full participants in their new country. At that time many ofthose immigrants saw the African slave trade and <AHREF="http://squash.la.psu.edu/plarson/smuseum.html">slavery</A> as a keyfeature of the American experience, and participation in it as truly American. In fact, itwas.<p>Many of these early Jewish-American writers thus missed the hideousness and thetragedy of what they were describing. Even Korn's 1961 article today seemsdownright blind to the suffering of the victims of the slave trade and theirdescendants. Since then, however, Jewish-American scholars have written some ofthe best studies of the internal workings of African-American slave communitiesin North America, and have been applauded by many African-American scholars fortheir understanding.<p>In assessing most historical works it is necessary to focus on mere details, onthe minutiae that constitute the evidentiary base of the enterprise. <i>TheSecret Relationship</i> includes numerous lists of Jewish shipowners andslaveholders. Its final chapter catalogues the involvement of numerous peoplewith Jewish names who are documented as having participated in the persecutionof Africans and especially African-Americans.<p>In addition, there are seventeen tables based on official U.S. Census data.These are drawn from the years 1790, 1820, and 1830, simply because those yearsare mentioned in secondary accounts written by Jews. There has been no analysisof the original data. The censuses of 1850 and 1860 are not considered,although the data from those two years were more informative.<p>To many readers, quibbling about census material may seem trivial; but when onegets down to individual cases, names and details are important in anyhistorical work. The city of Newport, Rhode Island, was indeed active in theeighteenth-century slave and rum trades, and it had a flourishing community ofJewish merchants. Readers of <i>The Secret Relationship</i> are told that thewriting of Jewish historians "seems to suggest that <i>all</i> the stills inNewport were owned by the Jews" in the eighteenth century. So much for themaking of rum, a commodity commonly used in the slave trade and also a directproduct of that same traffic. But what, then, is one to make of the fact thatmembers of the Coggeshall family, who first came to Rhode Island as Quakers andlater switched to the Church of England, were in the business of distilling onthe eve of the American Revolution? In 1772 both Nathaniel Coggeshalls (fatherand son) were "distillers."<p>Readers wanting to explore such a matter will not be helped by the book'sindex, which has no entry under "Newport," even though that little city isdiscussed or mentioned on at least eight pages. Similarly, there are no entriesfor much briefer mentions of Natchez and New Orleans, though other cities arethere, such as Detroit--not in the <i>D</i>s but in the <i>M</i>s, under"Michigan."<p><font size=5>T</font>HERE are several interrelated problems with this study. Itsets out to reshape the prevailing historical record concerning the treatment of Africans andAfrican-Americans during the period of the slave trade and slavery. Far fromasking any question at all, this book begins with an answer--that Jews wereespecially important in exploiting Africans. It is able to demonstrate, atleast ostensibly, that they were. This is the central difficulty: the book setsout to prove a thesis and pays little attention to evidence that might modifyor contradict it.If one were to inquire more neutrally into what role Jews played in theAtlantic slave trade, one would find that it was a considerable one during theformative years of the trade, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and avery small one when the trade reached much greater volume, in the eighteenthand early nineteenth centuries. This change in the role of Jews relative to theroles of other Europeans had to do with shifts in power and culture thatoccurred among various Atlantic-European nations over a period of some 500years. The trade was dominated first by the Portuguese, then by the Dutch, andthen by the English and, to a much lesser extent, the French.<p>The reasons for the important role of Jews in the early years of the slavetrade are not hard to find. To put the matter in summary terms, Jews inmedieval Europe had effectively been pushed by the Western branch of theChristian Church away from land ownership and into commerce and financialdealings. During those early years of western overseas expansion many Jewscontinued to find opportunities for drawing wealth from commerce and finance.Under heavy threat in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, many Portugueseand Spanish Jews found refuge in the Netherlands, a quasi-nation that by thattime had a widely reputed tolerance for religious diversity. Jewish citizens ofthe Netherlands were able to participate in domestic and foreign trade,including the slave trade on the coast of West Africa and in the Americas.These Jews, along with many Christian Dutch traders, supplied slaves not onlyto the Dutch colonial enterprises in Brazil and Surinam but also toCura&ccedil;ao and other islands in the Antilles for transhipment to the NewWorld colonies of other European nations. Ironically, Jews were therefore ableto make major investments in landed enterprises--which in tropical Americameant slave plantations--in Brazil and then Surinam.<p>This brutal trade in human beings was carried on by various African peoples andsociopolitical entities in West and West Central Africa. The participation ofthese groups also waxed and waned over the 500-year period. Internaldevelopments in Africa played an important part in determining how the tradevaried from place to place and from time to time. The expansion of Dahomey andof the Asante kingdom, for example, along with the declension of power in Oyo,had fully as much effect upon neighboring African peoples as the different butroughly parallel shifts in the balance of power among European nations had uponEurope.<p>Developments in Africa are of course not the concern of <i>The SecretRelationship</i>. Owing to the nature of available data, historians will neverknow as much about international, inter-ethnic, and interreligious conflicts inwestern Africa as they know about those in Western Europe. In the latter regionProtestants, Jews, and Roman Catholics, who lived in several politicalentities, traded in human beings with a great many more societies in Africa,whose members thought of their differences in such distinct terms as to defycomparison, but to whom such differences also mattered greatly.<p>One aspect of the present issue, however, is utterly clear: by focusing on theimportance of the activities of one internationally distributed religious groupof Europeans, the Jews, this book ignores diversities in Africa. In addition,by treating Africans as mere objects of trade, it deprives all Africans oftheir own <i>agency</i>, of their capacity to control or at least deal withtheir lives and their history, including the activities of powerful men whoenslaved other Africans and traded them to Europeans. In effect, it treatsmillions of African people as a mere undifferentiated blob, a pool of helplessvictims totally lacking in the perception, will, and power necessary to resistor to take advantage of economic opportunities. Such a focus radically distortsthe historical record.<p>This theme also has a depressingly familiar ring, because for many years whiteAmericans were saying almost exactly the same thing about black Americans. Thedusty old image is still clear in its reverberatory way--<i>those people</i>really couldn't accomplish anything, for <i>they</i> were always and inherentlyacted upon, rather than taking active roles in determining their fate. Thus thereader is thrust backward in time, forced to stare at facing mirrors. Thereflections bounce back and forth, continually conveying the earliest imagesgenerated not on the West African coast but in Western Europe and in its NewWorld settlements. Those images originated with the oppressors, not theoppressed. </blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

	<font size=5>M</font>ost of the modern classical composers, in the periods when they were digging

for roots, found it stimulating (but not quite inspiring) to hoe the fierce

rhythms of jazz. You can cite Ravel, Stravinsky, Gruenberg, Krenek, Carpenter,

Milhaud, and Copland for specific instances of jazziness; and like all other

human beings, they were not immune to the blues. Right now in New York City, it

is not considered a rare sight to see Leonard Bernstein leap from his table in

a smoky nightclub and rip off a number or two with the performers on the

bandstand. It all goes with the bohemia of desperation that sometimes engulfs

classical composers.<p>



<p>





But in the past few years, the jazz musicians, in a period when their own roots

are slightly withered, have been doing some leaping of their own. They are

using the surface techniques of the classics as a base for their own little

improvisations. And they are not really satisfied unless they have a hundred

symphonic musicians behind them while they are doing it. Jazz is now a familiar

commodity of the concert hall, an accepted cultural export to foreign

countries, and a subject for learned discussion. Most of the expressions of

happiness have been squeezed out of it.<p>



<p>



Everyone who has attended a jazz concert in the past five years has been

exposed to the painful moments when the spokesman for the musical group stands

before the audience and mumbles: "This here is a fugue--rondo

form--counterpoint--solo improvisations--return to theme. And we call it

'Dunkirk,' where everybody got away safe."<p>



<p>



The musicians who indulge in such fantasies are reflecting a segment of

contemporary jazz that has been dubbed the "Third Stream." It is a term coined

to describe what Gunther Schuller defines as the "attempts in various ways to

bring together the sounds and feeling of jazz with the more extended format of

contemporary symphonic literature.<p>



<p>



Schuller, a former French-horn player with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra who

now devotes full time to composing, conducting, and teaching, and John Lewis,

the musical director and pianist of the Modern Jazz Quartet, are the leaders in

the attempted amalgamation of jazz and classical idioms. Dave Brubeck has

plunked his own quartet down before several symphony orchestras, and his

brother Howard composed a piece titled Dialogues for jazz Combo and Orchestra,

which was recorded by Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic (Columbia

CL 143 CS-8257). Lewis and his chamber jazz group have performed with several

symphonic aggregations, notably in Germany, where this type of synthesis has

been seriously received. Jimmy Giuffre, a saxophonist-clarinetist whose style

has been torn in several directions of late, recently recorded his Piece for

Clarinet and Orchestra with the Sudwestfunk Orchestra of Baden Baden (Verve

8395, 68395), about as earnest a disaster as could be conceived.<p>



<p>



In 1960, four weeks of intensive work and a $5000 grant were spent at the

School of Jazz in Lenox, Massachusetts, in an attempt to synthesize a group of

classical strings with various jazz soloists. The work in progress was

described to the press as revolutionary in character, but the final result at

the graduation concert was a painful rendition of a few belabored

orchestrations that had been turned out almost thirty years before. The

catalyst needed to fuse the diverse musical elements was as unknown to the

teachers and pupils as it was to the already established star performers to be

found in the field.<p>



<p>



And yet, as with everything else; there is an exception to prove the rule.

There is an album that contains a jazz musician improvising to a written

background played by a symphonic string section, and it is one of the most

exhilaratingly delightful musical experiences of the past several years. It is

titled Focus (Verve 8412, 68412), and it features tenor saxophonist Stan Getz,

as soloist with a sixteen-piece string section, playing seven selections

composed by Eddie Sauter and conducted by Hershy Kay.<p>



<p>



Getz is the most satisfying tenor saxophonist at work today. There is none of

the flashy denseness of Sonny Rollins or John Coltrane in his work and his

predilection for ballads softens the edge of his newly acquired fierceness. He

is a court master of his instrument and brings freshness of thought and feeling

whatever he plays. His improvisational genius and superb technique are the

contemporary culmination of the mainstream of jazz.<p>



<p>



Sauter wrote the seven pieces for Getz in just under a year. Each composition

was written as an entity, with no special provision made for an accompanying

soloist. "What I wanted to do," said Sauter, "was write it like a string

quartet, with space to move things. I'd let them make their own time and

rhythm. . . . I wanted to write pieces that had continuity of thought and shape

and that had enough thematic strength to hold together almost in their own

right. And I always left, in the back of my mind, a space for another part to

be added. I didn't know what was going to happen in that area. That was the

hole I left for Stan."<p>



<p>



The finished pieces were scored for an orchestra of ten violins, four violas,

two cellos, a bass, a harp, and percussion. The group was built around the

Beaux Arts Quartet: Gerald Tarack, first violin; Alan Martin, second violin;

Jacob Glick, viola; and Bruce Rogers, cello. Getz's preparation for the

recording session was a quick perusal of a sketchy lead sheet of the scoring

and close attention to the musicians rehearsing the set pieces. The recording

was done in three sessions, with several takes made of each piece. Getz's

improvisations were the only variable factor. Usually the best take stood out

from the rest, and little splicing was done with the finished product. Most of

the editing was strictly an engineering matter, the balancing of sound between

the tenor saxophone and the orchestra to highlight the individual

characteristics of each.<p>



<p>



On one piece, however, it was impossible to decide which of the two takes was

the better one, so it was decided to splice them together into one sequence

rather than discard a note from either. This piece is the most exciting number

in the album. It is titled "I'm Late, I'm Late," and is a marvelous blending of

fierce rhythms, exciting sonorities from the strings, and a wild and woolly

Getz, darting in and through the symphonic riffs of the background.<p>



<p>



In this number, Sauter has conjured up an almost perfect recreation of the dash

of the Mad Hatter to the tea party in Walt Disney's version of Alice in

Wonderland. Drummer Roy Haynes, whose versatility is remarkable, pushes the

strings harder and harder in a musical representation of that huge gold watch

being plucked out of the pocket and shoved back in. Meanwhile, Getz floats

above the action, at times commenting wryly and dispassionately on what is

taking place, and at times being so caught up in the excitement that his horn

fairly shrieks for Alice to get out of the Hatter's way. It is one of the most

effective jazz program pieces that has ever been put on records.<p>



<p>



The other numbers vary in mood and intensity; dreamy and romantic, hard and

fierce, soft and mellow, stimulating and relaxing. The titles are

representative descriptions of what takes place within: "Her," "Pan," "I

Remember When," "Night Rider," "Once Upon a Time," and "A Summer Afternoon."<p>



<p>



Through them all, the focus is on Getz's saxophone, but his artistry is such

that he never intrudes in the set piece; he is always part of the musical

framework that has been laid out. His warm, easy tone flows through the ballad

pieces, and on the up tempos he shows such strength of attack, such ability to

swing that he carries the strings and rhythm along with him at his pace and

inclination. His improvisation has so great an air of newness, of originality,

and of intensity of feeling that he gives hope for the future in this

sidestream of jazz.<p>



<p>



For it is a sidestream, albeit one that seems to be occupying more and more of

the attention of serious jazz musicians. One group of jazz seekers, notably

Ornette Coleman, Sonny Rollins, Cecil Taylor, Don Ellis, and Paul Bley, have

been making their sound either by running up and down the scales at breakneck

speed while changing chords, according to the phases of the moon, or by

grabbing individual notes and beating them to death.<p>



<p>



There is another type of endeavor that is becoming more and more popular with

the young jazz composers and players. It can only be described as "non-jazz

jazz." It is somewhat similar to the Third Stream in its formation, but it has

none of the pretensions. One of the outstanding examples of this offshoot can

be heard in an album titled A Day in the City: Six Jazz Variations on a Theme

by the Don Friedman Trio (Riverside RLP 384), featuring Friedman on piano, Joe

Hunt on drums, and Charles Israels on bass.<p>



<p>



Friedman is a 27-year-old composer-pianist from the West Coast who has worked

everything from bop bashes to cocktail lounges. Recently, an instructor in

composition gave him the task of writing a set of variations on the theme of an

old folk song, "The Minstrel Boy." Friedman worked out the variations on a

linear line only, without the chord sequences that are necessary for jazz

improvisation. But as the piece became a part of him, he conceived the

programmatic possibilities, and he chose a chord sequence that seemed

appropriate to the composition's mood. The result is A Day in the City, with

sequences designated as "Dawn," "Midday," "Rush Hour," "Sunset," "Early

Evening," and "Night." The moods are presented in terms of rhythm, and can

follow the story line in the musical scenes.<p>



<p>



The best description that can be given of A Day in the City is that it is

pleasant to hear. There is nothing startling in it. The soloists carry the

listener through a place named York City, and the whole album has a surge that

is vital, warm, and provocative. It is not jazz, but jazz-oriented. In all

events, good music.<p>



<p>



We must focus, therefore, on Getz if we are to find a reason why Focus is an

exciting piece of jazz while the efforts of Schuller, Lewis, Brubeck, Giuffre,

and the others turn out to be neither jazz, classical, nor good program music.

The amalgamation that was desired by these musicians was never achieved, and

the results are bits and pieces interspersed among other bits and pieces.<p>



<p>



Focus is no answer to the problem that has been plaguing the jazz musicians

seeking a way out of the maze. It gives them a goal to work toward in emulating

Stan Getz's jazz genius. The pieces by Eddie Sauter are first-rate and possess

qualities to spark a soloist to the top of his abilities. But it is the fire

alone that gives heat and light, and it is Getz who burns brightly throughout.

Focus is an exceptional album that features a group of alchemists who found the

right combination through hard work and a little bit of luck. It is hard to say

whether same men could do it again under similar circumstances. It is easy to

say that probably no other group now recording can accomplish anything as

outstanding. That is a sad state. But that is the sad state of jazz today.<p>

It was hard to see in Lincoln, a failed Senatecandidate from Illinois with a reputation for moderate views on how the nationshould deal with slavery, the lineaments of the Great Emancipator. <i>TheAtlantic</i>'s candidate for the nomination had been William Henry Seward, who"represented the most advanced doctrines of his party"--that is to say, he wasmore radical than Lincoln on the issue of abolition. The editors disliked theidea of compromise with "the slave power." But as a practical matter they camearound to Lincoln in the end. His willingness to countenance slavery where italready existed would perhaps mean that the threat of secession would recede.His opposition to the extension of slavery to the territories meant that thepublic fight against slavery would continue. In utterance Lincoln'sdenunciation of slavery remained eloquent and unequivocal.<p>"On Abortion:A Lincolnian Position," this month's cover story, explores thegrounds of Lincoln's closely argued views on slavery, finding in them apolitical language and logic relevant to the most morally charged issue inAmerican politics since slavery. George McKenna, a political scientist at theCity College of New York, first conceived the idea for this article whilestudying the Lincoln-Douglas senatorial debates of 1858--debates preceding theelection that Lincoln lost. "What you might call the morphology of the debateover the extension of slavery to the new territories," McKenna says, "wasstrikingly similar to the current debate over abortion."<p>Among the parallels he sees:<p><li>Lincoln and Douglas agreed that slavery was a moral issue, but to Douglas, asto proponents of abortion rights today, the central question was an essentiallyprivate one. Lincoln perceived a great public dimension that transcended thesphere of merely private choice.<p><li>Douglas showed little interest in whether a slave was a person. Lincoln, likepro-lifers today, argued that the question of personhood was paramount.<p>But Lincoln did not want to make slavery illegal:that would tear the countryapart. He wanted, rather, to stop its spread, and to hope and work for the daywhen moral suasion and public sentiment would accomplish what had not beenaccomplished in law. Ultimately, of course, this position proved untenable--inthe matter of slavery. But McKenna argues that Lincoln's initial approach toslavery offers a model that politicians who want to heal the divisions in thecountry over abortion should follow.   --THE EDITORS</blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

	<font size=5>I</font>N <I>Miles: The Autobiography</I> the trumpeter Miles Davis remembers his excitement

at hearing the Billy Eckstine Orchestra, with Charlie Parker and Dizzy

Gillespie, in a St. Louis nightclub in 1944. It was his first in-person

exposure to bebop, and also his baptism by fire as a musician--just eighteen at

the time, he was pressed into service as an emergency fill-in. "The way that

band was playing music--that was <I>all</I> I wanted to hear."<p>



<p>



Davis's reaction was typical of that of most young musicians in the 1940s. What

thrilled them about bebop was its impossible combination of the breakneck and

the Byzantine. It was all they wanted to hear and all they wanted to play. But

an early mark of Davis's singularity was that soon after becoming Gillespie's

protege and Parker's sideman, he also became their loyal opposition. "Diz and

Bird [Parker] played a lot of real fast notes and chord changes because that's

the way they heard everything; that's the way their voices were: fast, up in

the upper register," Davis observes in <I>Miles</I>, which was written in

collaboration with the poet and journalist Quincy Troupe. "Their concept of

music was <I>more</I> rather than <I>less</I>. I personally wanted to cut the notes down."<p>



<p>



Davis's entire career can be seen as an ongoing critique of bebop: the origins

of "cool" jazz (his collaborations with Gil Evans in the late 1940s), hard bop,

or "funky" (his 1954 recording of "Walkin'"), modal improvisation (the track

"Milestones" in 1958 and the 1959 album <I>Kind of Blue</I>), and jazz-rock fusion (In

a <I>Silent Way</I> and <I>Bitches Brew</I>, both recorded in 1969) can be traced to his

efforts to tear bebop down to its essentials. Unable as a younger musician to

play "fast," or "in the upper register," Davis became an innovator out of

necessity.<p>



<p>



His decision, in 1969, to court a younger audience by playing rock venues,

adding amplified instruments to his ensemble, and cranking up both the volume

and the beat also amounted to a critique of modern jazz, which he felt had

become tired and inbred. So, in effect, did his withdrawal from the recording

studio and public performance from 1970 to 1980, years in which "sex and drugs

took the place that music had occupied in my life until then and I did both of

them around the clock." He barely touched his horn in these years, but he

haunted jazz with his silence.<p>



<p>



Two groups of listeners now feel that Davis has sold them out: jazz fans of a

certain age who have never forgiven him for going electric, and the rock

audience that discovered him with <I>Bitches Brew</I> and--try as it might--can't get

with the slick techno-funk he has been recording since <I>The Man With the Horn</I>,

in 1981. But the audience he has his sights on now, although he's unlikely to

reach it without a hit single, is the audience that grooves to Prince and

Michael Jackson, and commercial survival doesn't seem to be his only

motivation--ego, racial identity and a desire for eternal youth (or continuing

relevance) all seem to be mixed up in it.<p>



<p>



For many of his more worshipful fans, of all ages and races, Davis's music has

always been just one component of a mystique that also involves his beautiful

women, his up-to-the-minute wardrobe, his expensive taste in sports cars, and

his scowling black anger: his celebrity boils down to an insider's life-style

and an outsider's stance. His magnetism is so powerful that fans who haven't

liked anything he's done in years continue to buy his records and to attend his

concerts, irrationally hoping for a reversal of form.<p>



<p>



On stage he remains an electrifying presence, although you wonder now when you

go to hear him (as you do with the seventy-one-year-old Dizzy Gillespie, but

for a different reason) not how well he'll play but how much.  He has become a

kind of roving conductor, walking from sideman to sideman, describing what he

wants from them with a pump of his shoulders or a wiggle of his hips, blowing

riffs into their faces and letting them pick it up from there. He still turns

his back on the audience for much of the show, as he was infamous for doing in

the 1950s and 1960s The difference is that now he has a wireless microphone on

his horn which allows him to be heard clearly with his back turned--and that

audiences would be disappointed, at this point, if he failed to strike his

iconographic pose. Though his shows are never boring, you're not quite sure how

you feel about them afterward. Is Davis admirable, as his apologists would have

it, for refusing to rest on his laurels--for keeping up with the latest black

musical and sartorial fashions? Or is there something pathetic about the sight

of a sixty-three-year-old man in clogs, parachute pants. and jheri curls

shaking his fanny to a younger generation's beat?<p>



<p>



"When I hear jazz musicians today playing all those same licks we used to play

so long ago, I feel sad for them," he writes.<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

Most people my age like old, stuffy furniture.  I like the new Memphis style

of sleek high-tech stuff . . . . Bold colors and long, sleek, spare lines. I

don't like a lot of clutter or a lot of furniture either. I like contemporary

stuff. I have to always be on the cutting edge of things because that's just

the way I am and have always been.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



Anyone this vigilant about staying on the cutting edge is chasing trends--not

starting them, as Davis did in jazz from the late forties to the early

seventies (<I>Bitches Brew</I> and most of the double albums that followed it, though

turbid in retrospect, were undeniably influential at the time).<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>D</font>AVIS'S major accomplishment of recent years isn't any 

of his recordings but <I>Miles</I>, which enjoys an obvious advantage over 

the Davis biographies by Ian Carr, Jack Chambers.  Eric Nisenson, and Bill 

Cole.  Without the full involvement of their subject, these were 

essentially turntable companions--critical guides to Davis's work within a 

biographical framework.  But with <I>Miles</I>, Davis proves to be his own 

most perceptive critic (at least about his music before 1969), and the book 

is so successful in capturing Davis's voice (including his incessant, if 

tonally varied, use of profanity) that the odd line that sounds like the 

work of his collaborator (as when, for example, Davis supposedly resorts to 

quoting a jazz critic to describe the dramatic contrast between his style 

and that of his former sideman John Coltrane) calls for a double take.<p>



<p>

  

"The challenge .  . .  is to see how inventive you can become melodically," 

Davis writes, offering the clearest explanation I have ever read of the 

advantages of improvising on modes or scales rather than chord changes.  

"It's not like when you base stuff on chords, and you know at the end of 

thirty-two bars that the chords have run out and there's nothing to do but 

repeat what you've done with variations." <I>Kind of Blue</I>, which popularized 

modal improvisation, was the most influential jazz album of its period, but 

it was a disappointment of sorts for Davis, he writes.  The sound he wanted 

on <I>Kind of Blue</I>, and feels that he didn't quite achieve, was that of the 

"finger piano" (probably an African thumb piano) that accompanied a 

performance he saw by an African dance troupe.  Though Davis himself 

doesn't make the connection, this provides an unexpected rationale for the 

three electric pianos that phase in and out behind the horns on <I>In a Silent 

Way</I>.<p>



<p>



He writes about fellow musicians with an eye for detail that brings them into

photograph-like focus. On Gil Evans, for example:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

When I first met him he used to come to listen to Bird when I was in the band.

He'd come in with a whole bag of "horseradishes"--that's what we used to call

radishes--that he'd be eating with salt. Here was this tall, thin, white guy

from Canada who was hipper than hip . . . . But bringing "horseradishes" to

nightclubs and eating them out of a bag with salt, and a white boy? Here was

Gil on fast 52nd Street with all these super hip black musicians wearing peg

legs and zoot suits, and here he was dressed in a cap. Man, he was something

else.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



While acknowledging his genius, Davis characterizes Charlie Parker as "greedy,"

a man who "was always trying to con or beat you out of something to support his

drug habit."<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

Bird always said he hated the idea of being thought of as just an entertainer,

but . . . he was becoming a spectacle. I didn't like whites walking into the

club where we were playing just to see Bird act a fool, thinking he might do

something stupid.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



<I>Miles</I>'s considerable value as jazz history isn't what makes it such a

page-turner. Autobiography is a problematic literary form, because it's never

clear which is being submitted for the reader's approval, a book or its author.

Davis writes that he loved Parker as a musician but "maybe not as a person,"

and the Miles Davis who emerges from <I>Miles</I>--as complex as any character in

recent fiction--elicits a similar ambivalence from the reader.<p>



<p>



His treatment of women is contemptible: he isn't averse to slugging them to

keep them in line. It isn't bad enough that he talks with unconvincing remorse

of hitting his own women; the story intended to illustrate Billy Eckstine's

tough-guy credentials has Eckstine slapping a would-be girlfriend while Davis

looks on approvingly. He is spiteful toward the actress Cicely Tyson, the most

recent of his ex-wives:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

Cicely has done movie and TV roles where she played an activist or something

like that, a person who cared a lot about black people. Well, she ain't nothing

like that. She loves to sit up with white people, loves to listen to their

advice about everything and believes almost everything they tell her.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



Davis's fame and his relatively privileged upbringing (his father was a dentist

and an unsuccessful candidate for the Illinois state legislature) haven't

spared him from injustice, such as being clubbed over the head by a white

policeman after he was ordered to move on from the entrance of a New York City

nightclub in which he was performing in 1959. But much of what Davis interprets

as racism is his own hubris, as when he accuses white jazz critics of having

written approvingly in the mid-sixties of such black avant-gardists as Ornette

Coleman, Cecil Taylor, and Archie Shepp in an effort to deflect attention from

<I>him</I>. (Never mind that the critics most identified with what was then called

"the New Thing" were Amiri Baraka and A. B. Spellman, both of whom are black.)

He is peacock vain. He tells of admiring himself in a mirror in 1956, when his

star was on the rise. He wasn't yet making as much money as he thought he

should be, but he was looking "clean" in Brooks Brothers and custom-made

Italian suits. "I felt so good that I walked to the door and forgot my

trumpet."<p>



<p>



He writes of getting together every so often with the late James Baldwin in

France and "lying our asses off." You have to wonder, as you do with all

autobiographies, how much deliberate lying is being done here. Probably not a

lot, because for a man this caught up in his own mystique--a man fully aware

that his art and life are already the stuff of legend--just telling the truth

about himself as he sees it amounts to a form of self-aggrandizement.<p>

	<font size=5>T</font>he alto saxophonist Charlie Parker, the subject of 

	<I>Bird</I>, a new film produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, assured 

	himself of immortality when he recorded "Ko Ko" for Savoy Records, on 

	November 26, 1945.  This was not the first time that bebop was 

	performed in a recording studio, nor was "Ko Ko" the first bebop 

	"original" extrapolated from the chord sequences of an existing tune--a 

	practice that did not begin with bebop, contrary to popular belief.  

	For that matter, Parker ("Bird" to fans and fellow musicians) was not 

	the first improviser to recognize that despite the nondescript melody 

	of Ray Noble's "Cherokee," which served as the basis for "Ko Ko," its 

	fast-moving chords held the potential for a tour de force; the tenor 

	saxophonist Charlie Barnet had beaten him to it by six years, and had 

	had a big hit with "Cherokee."<p>



<p>



Yet there was really only one historical precedent for "Ko Ko"--Louis

Armstrong's 1928 "West End Blues." As Armstrong had done, Parker with one

performance reshaped jazz into his own image of it by establishing an exacting

new standard of virtuosity. Listeners encountering "Ko Ko" for the first time

are likely to be most astonished by Parker's insouciance in defamiliarizing

Noble's melody, and by his nimble execution at a tempo that starts off reckless

and gives the impression of speeding up as it goes along. But the most

remarkable aspect of the performance is its reconciliation of spontaneity and

form--the impression of economy despite the splatter of notes; the surprising

continuity of suspenseful introduction, staccato bursts, pulsating rests, and

phrases so lengthy that they double back on themselves at the bar lines.

Parker's contemporaries faced the challenge of not only matching his technique

but also emulating his harmonic and rhythmic sophistication, and his successors

still face the same challenge.<p>



<p>



Parker's innovations--and those of the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and the

pianist Bud Powell--are today so ingrained in jazz that it is difficult to

remember that bebop was initially considered so esoteric and forbidding that

only its originators could play it. "Ko Ko" would seem to prove the point.

Stimulated by Parker, the drummer Max Roach made a breakthrough of his own on

"Ko Ko," with an unyielding polyrhythmic accompaniment that amounted to a

second melodic line. Gillespie, who had been forced into service as a pianist

in relief of Sadik Hakim (listen to Hakim's disoriented introduction on

"Thrivin' on a Riff," recorded earlier at the session, and you'll know why),

also had to spell the trumpeter Miles Davis on "Ko Ko." Davis, then still in

his teens and making his recording debut, declined even to try his luck on the

piece.<p>



<p>



Parker was twenty-five but already addicted to heroin; he would be dead in less

than ten years. Two weeks after recording "Ko Ko" he traveled with Gillespie to

Hollywood for a nightclub engagement that lasted almost two months, despite the

generally hostile reaction of southern-California audiences to bebop (the new

style had been nurtured in secret on the East Coast, its dissemination hindered

by a musicians' union ban on new recordings and by wartime restrictions on

materials needed to manufacture records). Parker did not return to New York

with his bandmates; instead, he cashed in his airline ticket to buy drugs. The

next six months were a panicky time, as crackdowns by the Los Angeles police

sent the street price of heroin soaring and often made the drug unavailable at

any price. In August of 1946 Parker was confined at Camarillo State Hospital

after being arrested for setting fire to his hotel room following a disastrous

recording session.<p>



<p>



Parker spent six months at Camarillo and returned to New York in April of 1947.

He then began a period in which he could do no wrong--at least in the recording

studio, where he produced an unbroken succession of masterpieces for Dial and

Savoy, including his most memorable ballad performance, a harmonic tangent on

George Gershwin's "Embraceable You." Already married and divorced twice, he

wooed two women almost simultaneously, marrying one in 1948 and two years later

moving in with the other without bothering to divorce the first. In 1949 he

triumphed at the International Jazz Festival, in Paris. In 1950 he made the

first of several records on which he was accompanied by strings and woodwinds,

the format that brought him his greatest popular success.<p>



<p>



But he never kicked his drug habit for good, and he also drank to such excess

that his weight ballooned to more than two hundred pounds. Despite his drawing

power, nightclub owners gradually became reluctant to book him, for fear that

he would show up in no shape to perform or not show up at all. At one point he

was banned from Birdland, the Broadway nightclub that had been named in his

honor in 1950. Although he somehow eluded arrest for possession, the cabaret

card he needed in order to perform in New York City nightclubs was taken from

him without due process, at the recommendation of the narcotics squad, in 1951.

The incident that is said to have broken him was the death from pneumonia of

his two-year-old daughter by his common-law wife, Chan Richardson, in March of

1954. Late that year he swallowed iodine in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. He

died of lobar pneumonia on March 12, 1955 while watching television in the New

York apartment of the Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter, a wealthy jazz

patron. He was thirty-four, but physicians estimated his age at fifty to

sixty.<p>

<p>



<font size=5>F</font>OREST Whitaker stars as Charlie Parker in <I>Bird</I>, 

which was written by Joel Oliansky.  Miming to Parker's actual solos, with 

his eyes wide open and his shoulders slightly hunched and flapping, 

Whitaker captures the look we recognize from Parker's photographs and the 

one surviving television kinescope of him (a 1952 appearance on Earl 

Wilson's <I>Stage Entrance</I>, which is featured in the excellent jazz 

documentaries <I>The Last of the Blue Devils</I> and <I>Celebrating Bird: The 

Triumph of Charlie Parker</I>).  Unfortunately, Whitaker is unconvincing 

offstage, where most of <I>Bird</I> takes place.  On the basis of his brief but 

riveting turn as the young, possibly psychotic pool shark who spooks the 

master hustler, played by Paul Newman, in Martin Scorsese's <I>The Color of 

Money</I>, Whitaker was the right choice to play Parker--he's a master of the 

put-on, among other things.  But Whitaker's performance is too tense and 

pent-up to bring Parker to life, and by the end of the movie the actor 

seems as much the victim of heavy-handed direction and writing as the 

character does.  Even at the epic length of two hours and forty-three 

minutes, the narrative of <I>Bird</I> feels hurried and absentminded.  The movie 

has more flashbacks within flashbacks than any since Jacques Tourneur's 

1947 <I>Out of the Past</I>. You're never quite sure who's remembering what, 

what year it is, how famous Parker has become, or how long he has to 

live.<p>



<p>



Why is it always raining in jazz films, and why are the vices that kill

musicians always presented as side effects of a terminal case of the blues? It

merely drizzled throughout Bertrand Tavernier's <I>'Round Midnight</I>, and though

that film felt false in other ways, the mist was congruent with the slow-motion

music performed by the tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon, who was playing an

ailing musician and who himself is said to have been ill during the filming.

The music in <I>Bird</I> is bebop in its first ebullient and defiant manifestation,

but the mood of the film is downcast, with rain gushing against the windows of

melodramatically underlit interiors.<p>



<p>



This Charlie Parker has a storm cloud over his head. His unconscious is haunted

by symbols--or, to be more specific, by a cymbal, which flies across the screen

and lands with a resounding thud every time he drifts off. The vision is based

on an incident said to have occurred, to which Eastwood and Oliansky have given

too much interpretive spin. As an untutored seventeen-year-old in Kansas City,

Parker forgot the chord changes to "I Got Rhythm" while playing at a jam

session with Jo Jones, who was then the lionized drummer in the Count Basie

Orchestra. Jones threw one of his cymbals to the floor as a way of gonging the

teenager offstage. Except for overwrought conjecture by Ross Russell in a

purple passage toward the end of <I>Bird Lives!</I>, there is nothing in the

voluminous literature about Parker to suggest that this public humiliation

haunted him for the rest of his life. On the contrary, it is usually cited as

the incident that strengthened his resolve to become a virtuoso. But in

<I>Bird</I>'s retelling, the echo of that cymbal deprives Parker of all pleasure.

The film's Parker wants to rage but can only snivel, even when hurling his horn

through a control-room window. You don't believe for an instant that this

frightened sparrow could have summoned up the self-confidence to make a name

for himself in the competitive world of jazz in the 1940s, much less set that

world on its ear with "Ko Ko." Parker's torment is here, but not his hedonism

or his genius or the hint of any connections between them.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>M</font>UCH of what <I>Bird</I> tells us about Parker is 

hooey, and at least one of "Bird's" inventions is an abomination--a 

character, a slightly older saxophonist who knew Parker as an upstart in 

Kansas City, who is jealous when Parker becomes the talk of New York.  A 

final encounter with this saxophonist seals Parker's doom.  Parker stumbles 

down 52nd street, dazed to find that the jazz clubs that were the settings 

for his early triumphs have given way to strip joints.  (The excuse for his 

surprise is his having been holed up in the country with Chan Richardson 

for a few months, but anyone who knows anything about jazz during this 

period has to wonder if he's been on the moon--articles in the national 

press were bemoaning the departure of jazz from "The Street" as early as 

1948, and this is supposed to be 1955.)  Told by an acquaintance that he 

hasn't seen anything yet, he wanders into a theater where his old Kansas 

City rival is knocking 'em dead with greasy rhythm and blues <I>a la</I> King 

Curtis.  This triggers Parker's final breakdown.  Even assuming that it was 

necessary to invent a fictional nemesis for Parker, why name that character 

Buster, which the filmmakers should have known was the first name of one of 

Parker's real-life Kansas City mentors, the alto saxophonist Buster Smith?  

And why pretend that Parker, who is said to have found good in all kinds of 

music (and who, according to the composer David Amram, once compared his 

music to that of the rhythm-and-blues group The Clovers), would have been 

shocked into a fatal tailspin by the advent of rock-and-roll?<p>



<p>



The music in <I>Bird</I> seems phony too, even though Parker recordings were used for

most of the soundtrack. There were fans who followed Parker around the country,

sneaking cumbersome wire recorders into nightclubs to preserve his work and

shutting them off when his sidemen improvised. Eastwood and Lennie Niehaus, the

film's music supervisor, go these amateur engineers one better by filtering out

Parker's sidemen altogether in favor of new instrumental backing. In addition

to being unfair to the sidemen, many of whom were capable of keeping up with

Parker, this removes him from his creative context and gives no sense that

bebop was a movement.<p>



<p>



But Parker is out of context throughout <I>Bird</I>. The film would have us believe

that he had little curiosity about the world beyond jazz, which in turn showed

only opposition to him. In reality the musicians who worshipped Parker remember

him as well read, with a consuming interest in twentieth-century classical

composition. And black jazz musicians of Parker's era had a direct influence on

those white artists from other disciplines--the nascent hipsters and beats--who

were beginning to define themselves as outlaws from middle-class convention.

Parker was a source of fascination to these poets, novelists, and abstract

impressionists, who saw his artistic drive and suicidal self-indulgence as the

yin and yang of a compulsive nature pushing against physical limitations and

societal restraints. In <I>Bird</I> few white characters, except those from the jazz

underground, seem to know or care who Parker is, and he isn't sure himself.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE pity of all this is that Clint Eastwood is a jazz fan, and <I>Bird</I> is

supposed to have been a labor of love. In 1982 Eastwood directed and starred in

<I>Honkytonk Man</I>, the gentle, admirably straightforward story of a

Depression-era Okie troubadour called Red Sovine, who succumbs to tuberculosis

before realizing his dream of performing at the Grand Ole Opry. Among its other

virtues, that film managed to suggest the satisfaction that music brings both

to performers and to audiences. Perhaps believing that Parker was subjected to

a harsher reality than the character Sovine because he was black and a drug

addict, Eastwood has tried to find a more insistent rhythm for <I>Bird</I>, but the

one he has come up with feels choppy, disconnected, and pointlessly arty, with

dated experiments in time and point of view forcing him against his best

natural instincts as a storytelling director.<p>



<p>



A character based on Charlie Parker first appeared on screen in the guise of

Eagle, a heroin-addicted saxophonist, played by Dick Gregory in the forgotten

<I>Sweet Love, Bitter</I>(1967), which was taken from John A. Williams's novel

<I>Night Song</I>. Although Gregory's performance was surprisingly evocative, Eagle

was merely a peripheral figure in a civil-rights-era melodrama about a white

liberal college professor on the run from his conscience. In the late 1970s

Richard Pryor was supposed to star in a film about Parker that never got

made--which is probably just as well, because Pryor brings so much of his own

persona to the screen that Charlie Parker would have been buried. That leaves

us with <I>Bird</I>, a jazz fan's movie in the worst possible sense--a movie with

the blues, a <I>Birdland, Mon Amour</I> that wants to shout "Bird lives!" but winds

up whispering "Jazz is dead." <I>Bird</I> communicates the melancholy that every jazz

fan feels as a result of the music's banishment from mainstream culture. In

projecting this melancholy on Charlie Parker--whose music still leaps out with

its reckless abandon, and whose triumph should finally count for more than his

tragedy--Eastwood has made another of those movies that make jazz fans despair

that mainstream culture will ever do right by them or their musical heroes.<p>

	<font size=5>J</font>OHN ZORN, whom John Rockwell, of <I>The New York Times</I>, has called "the single

most interesting, important and influential composer to arise from the

Manhattan 'downtown' avant garde since Steve Reich and Philip Glass," is the

only musician I've ever considered suing. I'm not entirely joking. In 1989,

when Zorn (whose name in German means "anger"), wearing a T-shirt that read DIE

YUPPIE SCUM!, was playing Ornette Coleman tunes on alto saxophone with his band

Spy vs. Spy at the Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia, he put me and

everyone else in the small auditorium at risk of permanent hearing loss by

recklessly turning the volume up as high as it would go.<p>



<p>



I'm not ordinarily squeamish about loud music, but Spy vs. Spy's opening

downbeat was so brutal that I thought I felt my eardrums break. Thirty seconds

into the first tune my head was spinning as though I had been drunk and awake

for days on end, and my stomach began to churn in response to the music's

velocity, which I decided was almost as senseless as the volume. Zorn and Spy

vs. Spy--the alto saxophonist Tim Berne, the bassist Mark Dresser, and the

drummers Joey Baron and Michael Vatcher--were grinding Coleman's music down

into a feelingless, monochromatic din. They treated his compositions, which are

benchmarks of free jazz, as though they were speed metal (bohemianized heavy

metal, without the oversize stage accouterments) or hard core (the most

dystopian contemporary mutation of what used to be called punk). Although

intended as homage, the concert amounted to heresy, presenting Ornette Coleman

without the swing, sensuality, and blues-based <I>joie de vivre</I> that make even his

own forays into rock and funk recognizable as jazz and identifiable as his.<p>



<p>



All around me people were fleeing with hands over their ears, while a handful

of mostly younger audience members, there for the duration, sneered at them. I

should have fled too, but a combination of shell shock and journalistic

instinct kept me glued to my seat. (Someone, maybe an infuriated Ornette

Coleman fan, overturned a sales table of Zorn albums and compact discs on his

way out.) Who would have thought that a quintet without a single electric

instrument could inflict such pain? As though to add insult to injury the band

members chatted among themselves between salvos but didn't address the audience

until about twenty minutes and nine or ten numbers had passed. When Baron

glanced up from his drums, rather dazed-looking himself, I thought, and asked,

"How ya doin' out there?" I didn't hear anybody answer him.<p>



<p>



This nightmare was still on my mind when I spoke with Zorn in New York last

spring. "A lot of people were outraged when they first heard Ornette play his

music in the fifties and sixties," he said, in defense of his similar junking

of Coleman on his 1989 album <I>Spy vs. Spy</I> (Elektra Musician 9 60844). "The speed

and the power and the volume, those are elements that admittedly were not part

of Ornette's original conception. But those are essential elements in bringing

it up to date, in giving it the same impact it had then. Volume is an important

parameter. It's visceral. Physical."<p>



<p>



Granted, with practically anything now permissible in music, the threat of

physical damage posed by unreasonable volume might be the last remaining shock.

But shouldn't a musician be wary of long-term effects on his own hearing?

"Forget about it," said Zorn, a mild-looking thirty-seven-year-old native New

Yorker with a long, narrow face, stylish eyeglasses, and, when I saw him, the

beginnings of a ponytail.<p>



<p>



"My ears are blown already. I've been playing loud music for a long time." But

he admitted that some of his sidemen wear earplugs. "That's the loudest

situation they've ever been in," he said, referring to Naked City, another of

his bands, which, in addition to jazz tunes and movie themes, plays old surfing

hits and Zorn's own hard-core originals--a repertoire for which, I told him,

top volume does seem appropriate. When I heard Naked City perform live, they

were less painfully noisy than Spy vs. Spy.<p>



<p>



That observation brought a hoot. "We probably weren't loud enough, then," Zorn

said.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>B</font>Y Zorn's current standards, probably not. One of those New Yorkers who gives

the impression of being as proud of his city's sleaze as Iowans are of their

corn, Zorn delights in his self-created role as the bad boy of Manhattan's

eclectic fringe music scene. By now it's part of the identity he brings onstage

with him.<p>



<p>



In 1989, when the Brooklyn Philharmonic performed his "For Your Eyes Only" as

part of New Music America, an annual showcase for avant-garde music which is

staged in a different city each year, he used the space allotted him in the

festival brochure for a biography to attack NMA for annually sponsoring the big

names who "look good on grant applications or concert posters." (Most reviewers

lambasted Zorn for taking the money if he felt that way, but his piece had been

commissioned by the Brooklyn Philharmonic, which considered the piece its own

to perform whenever it wished.)<p>



<p>



Zorn once wrote a piece for the Kronos Quartet which called on the members of

that resolutely with-it but essentially straitlaced string ensemble to bark and

growl like dogs. That's an example of his humor at its most lighthearted, but

it can be heavy-handed, too. He once faxed a message to an Austrian concert

promoter requesting that his trio be billed as ZOG--an acronym for

"Zionist-occupied government," which is a rallying cry for The Order, the Aryan

supremacist group that murdered the Denver talk-show host Alan Berg in 1984.

The trio, which Zorn describes as "the world's first all-Jewish heavy-metal

band" and whose other members are the guitarist Elliott Sharp, a veteran free

improviser, and the drummer Ted Epstein, from Blind Idiot God, Zorn's favorite

speed-metal group, ultimately decided on the name Slan, after a monster in a

1950s science-fiction novel.<p>



<p>



Zorn, in short, is exactly the sort of rude, overgrown adolescent you would go

out of your way to avoid, if only he weren't so . . . well, interesting,

important, and influential (at least potentially). A decade ago he seemed just

a minor figure in the New York avant-garde--not innovative, just eccentric. At

that time his work consisted mostly of "games" pieces, which were prankish,

discontinuous, Zorn-"cued" group improvisations with titles like "Archery,"

"Rugby," and "Soccer." These sounded like frat-house Stockhausen and qualified

as Zorn compositions only in the sense that a party can be said to belong to

the person who throws it.<p>



<p>



Then Zorn sprang a delightful surprise with <I>The Big Gundown</I> (Nonesuch 9 79139),

a 1986 album on which he played the film music of Ennio Morricone, an Italian

composer best known in this country for his soundtracks to Sergio Leone's

spaghetti westerns. But Morricone has a much greater range than that, as Zorn

showed. The album would have been notable if only for rounding up a who's who

of lower-Manhattan music, including the keyboard player Wayne Horvitz and the

guitarists Bill Frisell and Fred Frith, all of whom subsequently joined Naked

City. With its kinesthetic mix of musical styles and its equivalent of jump

cuts, wipes, fades, and dissolves, it played like a witty essay on the

relationship between music and film--the perfect salute to its subject. In an

obvious parallel with contemporary painting, the album established Zorn as a

composer by acquisition, capable of altering a work's meaning by shifting its

context. He gave new significance to the word "cover," traditional

record-business parlance for slavish emulation of another artist in an attempt

to tap a new audience (in the 1950s, for instance, Pat Boone and other white

artists "covered" Fats Domino and Little Richard). In Zorn's terms,

reinterpretation in another style is the ultimate act of homage.<p>



<p>



A year later he followed up with <I>Spillane</I> (Nonesuch 9 79172), an album whose

lengthy title track so successfully evoked the testosterone-and-bile ethos of

its pulp-novelist namesake that, as Zorn complained to me, it was accepted as

another of his covers rather than as an original work. With these back-to-back

releases, Zorn helped to clarify a previously murky new aesthetic:

"avant-garde" as an <I>attitude</I> toward music, and an eclectic, self-contained

genre, rather than simply a vanguard movement in classical, jazz, or pop

music.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>Z</font>ORN called attention to an audience whose values were identical to his as a

performer, and that had just been waiting for someone like him to come

along--something usually true of only the biggest pop stars, and almost never

true of avant-gardists. "In general, my generation and younger, this is how we

grew up," Zorn, who was born in Manhattan and raised in Queens, told me. "We

had an unprecedented variety of music available to us, because of the

availability of everything on LP."<p>



<p>



Zorn's mother, a professor of education, liked classical music and world ethnic

recordings; his father, a hairdresser, listened to jazz, country, and French

chansons. "And through my brother, who's seven years older and wanted to be a

greaser in the fifties, I was exposed to doo wop and the Silhouettes, groups

like that." Around the age of fourteen, Zorn says, he immersed himself in

Stravinsky, Webern, Ives, Varese, and such contemporary experimental composers

as Stockhausen and Mauricio Kagel. "But all through that period I was listening

to the Doors and playing bass in a surf band." As a high school student

commuting daily from Queens to Manhattan, he also spent a lot of time in

Manhattan's repertory movie houses, sometimes watching movies for so long that

he had to sleep at a schoolmate's apartment in Manhattan.<p>



<p>



He found himself spellbound by film music--"the many styles a film composer has

to know in order to complement the images," he says. "In that sense I think the

great film composers are the precursors of what my generation is doing today.

His pantheon includes Morricone, Bernard Herrmann, John Barry, Dmitri Tiomkin,

Jerry Goldsmith, and Henry Mancini. Zorn's biggest formative influence of all,

though, was Carl Stalling, whose music for Warner Bros. cartoons he worshiped,

he realized later, for its discontinuity and use of Stockhausen-like "sound

blocks."<p>



<p>



Stalling is suddenly in vogue. Last fall, in New York, <I>Bugs on Broadway</I>

featured Bugs Bunny cartoons accompanied by a live orchestra playing Stalling's

original music. The best of his sound tracks for Bugs, Daffy Duck, Road Runner,

and others in the animated menagerie have now been collected on <I>The Carl

Stalling Project: Music From Warner Bros. Cartoons 1936-1958</I> (Warner Bros.

976027). Zorn, in the liner notes, praises Stalling for "following the visual

logic of screen action rather than the traditional rules of musical form," thus

creating "a radical compositional arc unprecedented in the history of music."<p>



<p>



After high school Zorn briefly attended Webster College, in St. Louis. "a very

small hippie liberal-arts school that let you study whatever you wanted to and

was the only college that would accept me." It was there that he "got turned on

to the jazz scene seriously," through live exposure to Julius Hemphill, Oliver

Lake, Hamiet Bluiett, and other then-local musicians who had bonded into a

collective called BAG, for Black Artists Group. "I knew I didn't have a place

in that, but I didn't really want a place. Jazz was just another kind of music

I studied and learned from."<p>



<p>



When trying his hand at straight jazz, Zorn can be controversial without any

effort. On <I>News for Lulu</I> (Hat Art 6005), a 1987 trio session with Frisell on

guitar and the trombonist George Lewis, Zorn plays compositions by Sonny Clark,

Kenny Dorham, Hank Mobley, and Freddie Redd--unsung jazzmen associated with

Blue Note Records in the late fifties and early sixties, a period and a sound

now being driven into the dust by solemn young neoclassical hard-boppers.

Zorn's approach is the antithesis of theirs. To begin with, his instrumentation

is unorthodox (no rhythm section), and his choice of tunes is noncanonic. And

instead of merely zipping through the chord changes of the tunes, he pays

careful attention to their melodies and rhythms, finding in them

improvisational possibilities that even their composers overlooked.<p>



<p>



Not everyone appreciates Zorn's fresh slant on hard bop. Some reviewers dismiss

it as his desperate attempt to mask his lack of conventional musicianship. Such

criticism irks Zorn, although he swears it doesn't. "Some people say I can't

play the changes, some people say I can't play in tune, and some people say I

can't play the saxophone," he told me. "My basic response is I'm doing the best

I can. You can spend your whole life, like Frisell has, learning to get inside

the chords. I don't do it that way."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>Z</font>ORN'S way still includes free improvisation. Last May he gave a three-night

retrospective of his games pieces--each involving a different group of

improvisers--at the Knitting Factory, in lower Manhattan, a few blocks from his

apartment. I was in the audience the first night, sitting behind two musicians

awaiting their turn to go onstage. "Which piece is this?" one asked the other

during Zorn's "Rugby." "I don't know. Don't they all sound alike?" the second

musician replied. I had the feeling that they'd had this conversation many

times before.<p>



<p>



A truism about free improvisation is that it's fun to play but murder to sit

through. Another truism is that you have to be there: it doesn't work on disc.

At the Knitting Factory the rowdy fraternity of Zorn's music won me over,

especially the trio piece "Rugby," performed by the cellist Tom Cora and the

violinist Polly Bradford, with Zorn on saxophone and duck calls. (Apparently

more considerate of audiences on his home turf than of those on the road, he

warned that "Rugby" would be "excruciatingly loud," though it really wasn't.)

But I hesitate to recommend even <I>Cobra</I> (Hat Art 2-6040), arguably Zorn's most

successful record in this genre, which I listened to immediately upon receiving

it in 1987 and have had no interest in playing since.<p>



<p>



Along with <I>The Big Gundown</I> and <I>Spillane</I>, the best introduction to Zorn's work

is <I>Naked City</I> (Elektra/ Nonesuch 9 79238), on which he takes genre-bending to

delicious new extremes. Zorn being Zorn, <I>Naked City</I> tries your patience with a

cluster of eight ear-numbing rants by the band and the screaming singer

Yamatsuka Eye, none lasting more than thirty-eight seconds. My advice is to

skip selections ten through seventeen when programming the CD, because the

other eighteen tracks justify the effort. Zorn atones for <I>Spy vs. Spy</I> with a

crafty reinterpretation of Ornette Coleman's "Lonely Woman," loaded with

verbatim Coleman quotes over a this-means-business bass line appropriated from

John Barry's "The James Bond Theme" (which is itself transformed into a Jimi

Hendrix-style rave-up a few tracks later). It shouldn't work, but it does. The

most satisfying of the disc's several movie themes are Georges Delerue's

"Contempt" (done as an art-rock symphony, a la Glenn Branca) and Morricone's

"The Sicilian Clan," on which Zorn's improvisation takes the form of an edgy

but wonderfully apposite countermelody.<p>



<p>



Of the Zorn originals, the one that stays with you the longest is "Saigon

Pickup." It's just under five minutes long, and it comes at you in sections (as

Fred Astaire said of a femme fatale in the Mickey Spillane parody in the movie

<I>The Bandwagon</I>): a minimalistic, almost Philip Glass-like piano theme; then Zorn

squalling over an Asian-sounding scale; then a country-and-western pastiche;

then back to the piano theme, this time reinforced by string synthesizer; then

more squalling, followed by more C&amp;W; then some lounge jazz; then some

psychedelic organ and reggae drumming; then a gleeful, Ornette Coleman-like

melody; then more country, more squalling, more minimalism, and the final fade.

Yet it isn't a hopeless audio collage. You never feel as though you're being

given a smug demonstration of what's currently hot in music, as you sometimes

do with Zorn (on this album's "Graveyard Shift," for example).<p>



<p>



Zorn's breadth is such that he tends to fragment the intrepid audience he

already has, which would seem to put mass-cult adulation out of the question.

But on tracks like <I>Naked City</I>'s "Latin Quarter," "Reanimator," and "Batman" (a

Zorn original, not Prince's movie or Neal Hefti's TV-show theme) the group

rocks out so hard that some of his fans have begun to think of it as Zorn's

"boogie" band--his ticket to commercial success. Guess again. Naked City's

second release, due later this year, will consist of what Zorn calls "classical

covers" of works by Debussy, Ives, and Scriabin, among others. It's all part of

Zorn's determination to take listeners by surprise. Let's hope this one doesn't

hurt.<p>

contemporaries recapitulate modern jazz</i></b></font></center>

	

	<pre>



	</pre>

	

	

	<font size=5>J</font>UST eighteen when he made his debut with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, the

trumpeter Wynton Marsalis answered the prayers of those who feared that the

clock was running out for jazz, as it clearly already had for the blues. Most

of the surviving heroes of swing and bebop were in decline, and the prevailing

wisdom was that no successors were in the wings. But here was an immensely

gifted musician still in his teens who played straight-ahead jazz, rather than

funk or fusion. That he was a black second-generation jazzman (the son of the

obscure pianist Ellis Marsalis) from New Orleans, the city generally

acknowledged to be the birthplace of jazz, was taken as an especially good

omen.<p>



<p>



This was in 1980, and Marsalis has since achieved a celebrity rare for a

contemporary jazz musician, partly as a result of his parallel career in

classical music. At twenty-six he is no longer a prodigy. He is now four years

older than Miles Davis was when he recorded the first of his classic nonet

sessions, two years older than Clifford Brown was when he recorded "Jordu" and

"Joy Spring." It is time to ask if Marsalis has fulfilled his potential, what

his influence has been on musicians his own age and younger, and whether he has

expanded the audience for jazz, as many hoped that he would.<p>



<p>



The answer to the first question is a qualified yes. With his chill tone and

jabbing attack, Marsalis still echoes Miles Davis, just as he did eight years

ago with Blakey. Moreover, now that Marsalis leads his own band, he takes his

cues from the quintet that Davis led from 1964 to 1967, which included the

pianist Herbie Hancock, the bassist Ron Carter, the drummer Tony Williams and

the saxophonist Wayne Shorter (who is still the primary role model for

Marsalis's brother, the saxophonist Branford Marsalis, older than Wynton by one

year and a former member of his group). Yet Marsalis has made progress in

finding a voice of his own. There is a sly wit to his half-valve work that owes

nothing to Davis, although it does recall the veteran trumpeter Clark Terry,

one of Davis's early influences. Another sign of Marsalis's enhanced

individuality is the way he has zeroed in on the most provocative aspect of the

Davis Quintet's music from the middle sixties: its circling,

now-you-hear-it-now-you-don't approach to the beat.<p>



<p>



Marsalis is one of very few jazz musicians able to line up enough work to keep

a band together full-time, and his rapport with his rhythm section on the

recent <I>Marsalis Standard Time--Volume 1</I> (Columbia FC-40461) attests to the

virtues of stability in personnel. There are moments when Marsalis, the pianist

Marcus Roberts, the bassist Robert Leslie Hurst III, and the drummer Jeff Watts

sound as though they were playing in four different time signatures. But

actually they are stretching a basic quadruple meter four different ways,

accenting different beats in every measure, and trusting that the listener will

feel the downbeat in his bones. The effect is mesmerizing, and it would be

beyond the ken of a group hastily assembled for a recording date.<p>



<p>



<I>Marsalis Standard Time--Volume 1</I> is the first of Marsalis's albums (discounting

a best-forgotten 1984 encounter with strings) to be mostly given over to

vintage pop songs of the sort that provided excellent vehicles for improvisers

from Louis Armstrong to John Coltrane but that too many younger musicians have

rejected in favor of their own compositions. The album is a reminder of the

outstretched hand that such songs have long offered to audiences trying to find

a point of entry into jazz. Although the reckless tempos frequently reduce the

melodies to unrecognizable blurs, the hint of familiarity left in the standards

"Caravan," "April in Paris," "Foggy Day," "The Song Is You," and "Autumn

Leaves" brings the Marsalis quartet's rhythmic cunning into a sharp focus

lacking in his other albums.<p>



<p>



The two songs on the album that are Marsalis originals--a fleet blues and an

almost motionless ballad--seem out of place, not because they are intrinsically

unworthy but because they are not subjected to as many rhythmic variations as

the standards. "Memories of You," a solo feature for Roberts, begins

promisingly, with wrinkled blues shadings and Thelonious Monk-like rhythmic

hesitations, but falters as a result of Roberts's attempt to cram the entire

history of jazz piano, from stride to free, into one three-minute performance.

There are two versions of "Cherokee," both taken at a tempo considerably less

punishing than the one that Charlie Parker set when he reharmonized the song as

"Ko Ko," in 1945, but punishing enough to tongue-tie Marsalis. He redeems

himself, however, on a lovely interpretation of Benny Goodman's old sign-off

theme "Goodbye" and a straightforward reading of "New Orleans" that comes

across as a modernist's heartfelt tribute to Louis Armstrong.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE question of Marsalis's influence is tricky. Even without him, musicians in

their twenties might be looking back two decades for inspiration, to the period

before John Coltrane's death, in 1967, and the gradual defection of Miles Davis

and his sidemen to high-tech funk--the last time when there was anything

approaching general agreement on what constituted the state of the art. But

inasmuch as Marsalis's emergence identified this anachronistic impulse as a

movement, such subsequent arrivals as Branford Marsalis, the alto saxophonist

Donald Harrison, the drummer Marvin "Smitty" Smith, and the trumpeters Terence

Blanchard and Wallace Roney are Wynton's children.<p>



<p>



Despite his large stylistic debt to Wayne Shorter, Branford Marsalis once 

seemed the most promising of these young musicians, but he has failed to 

deliver.  His mastery of his instrument is impressive, and so is his grasp 

of jazz history.  Called on to evoke Ben Webster's burly savoir faire in 

"Take the 'A' Train," on Mercer Ellington's <I>Digital Duke</I>(GRP 

GR1038), Marsalis performs the task admirably.  But <I>Renaissance</I> (Columbia 

FC-40711), his own most recent album, suggests that his ability to mimic 

different styles is not necessarily an asset.  Each of his phrases seems to 

be enclosed in quotation marks: not only "Wayne Shorter" but "John 

Coltrane," "Sonny Rollins," and "Joe Henderson," too.  All that is missing 

is "Branford Marsalis."<p>



<p>



Donald Harrison and Terence Blanchard are from New Orleans, like the Marsalis

brothers, whom they succeeded in the Jazz Messengers. The recent <I>Crystal Stair</I>

(Columbia FC-40830) is typical of the four albums they have made as co-leaders

of their own group since 1983. The level of musicianship is high, and there is

as much rhythmic detail and acceleration of tempo as on <I>Marsalis Standard

Time--Volume 1</I>, but Harrison and Blanchard lack Wynton Marsalis's command of

dynamics, and the result is that each track is indistinguishable from the one

before it. The Marsalis brothers are the models for Harrison and Blanchard,

which means that <I>Crystal Stair</I> sounds like the 1965 Miles Davis Quintet twice

removed. On <I>Eric Dolphy and Booker Little Remembered Live at Sweet Basil</I>

(ProJazz CDJ-640, available only as a compact disc with a companion cassette of

the same material), Harrison and Blanchard are cast in the roles of the two

late musicians, who were among the most individualistic in jazz. The other

participants in this 1986 New York club session are the pianist Mal Waldron,

the bassist Richard Davis, and the drummer Ed Blackwell, all reprising the

roles they played on the original Dolphy and Little recordings, recorded at the

Five Spot in New York in 1961. Although Blanchard is out of his depth trying to

capture Little's melancholy, Harrison surprises the listener with searing

improvisations that are satisfying in their own right, if too conventional in

pitch to evoke Dolphy.<p>



<p>



Marvin "Smitty" Smith, once the drummer in the Harrison-Blanchard group, makes

his debut as a leader with <I>Keeper of the Drums</I> (Concord Jazz CJ325), an album

that owes much of its vibrancy to Smith's savvy in recognizing the individual

abilities of the members of his ensemble--Wallace Roney, the trombonist Robin

Eubanks, the pianist Mulgrew Miller, the bassist Lonnie Plaxico, and the

saxophonists Steve Coleman and Ralph Moore--and his allocation of solo space in

a way that shows each off to best advantage. Coleman's angular phrasing is well

suited to the Dolphy-esque "Miss Ann," for example, and the sanctified

call-and-response patterns of "The Creeper" are custom-made for the blues-based

styles of Roney and Miller. Roney's <I>Verses</I> (Muse MR-5335), which benefits from

Tony Williams's tidal-wave drumming, is more of a blowing date, and this proves

to be an advantage on "Slaves" and the title track, two themeless blues with

crescendoing solos by Roney, Miller, and the tenor saxophonist Gary Thomas. But

on the remaining tracks, including the Miles Davis-Bill Evans composition "Blue

in Green," these three soloists adhere too timidly to the guidelines set by

Davis, Evans, and Coltrane in 1959 on the famous original.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>O</font>N all these recent albums rhythm is secondary to pulsation, and harmony is

frequently suspended in the interest of mood. In that sense these albums recall

those Miles Davis made for Columbia in the middle sixties and those his sidemen

made for Blue Note during the same period, with a stable of like-minded

musicians that included the vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, the trumpeter

Freddie Hubbard, and the tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson. What gave the Blue

Note albums urgency was their moderation while a revolution was going on

elsewhere in jazz, in the more iconoclastic music of Coltrane, Ornette Coleman,

Cecil Taylor, Albert Ayler, Sun Ra, and Archie Shepp.<p>



<p>



These newer records convey an urgency, too, but it is the urgency of fighting

the clock, of insisting that there is still adventure to be found in a

twenty-year-old style of jazz that represented a cautious retreat even when

new. It is not surprising that the musicians, in their twenties, are finding a

ready audience among lifelong jazz fans at least a decade older. Nostalgia for

the recent past is a widespread vice, catered to by the very technology that

was supposed to hurl us into a future from which there would be no looking

back. The new ghosts in the machine include oldies radio, television reruns,

vintage films on video cassette, and Beatles and Motown reissues on compact

disc (a format still so expensive that consumers feel safer sticking with the

tried and true). But nostalgia is a vice to which jazz fans are especially

susceptible. In the late 1960s Bob Dylan and the Beatles won for rock-and-roll

more intellectual cachet than jazz had ever enjoyed, and both rock and

rhythm-and-blues supplanted jazz as music for hedonistic release.<p>



<p>



For many listeners, New Age music now serves as the backdrop for meditation

that Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders once provided. It's been a long time, in

other words, since a passion for jazz was regarded as hip rather than quaint.

So a yearning for a time when Miles Davis was a trend-setter both musically and

sartorially is understandable, even among those too young to remember such a

time firsthand.<p>



<p>



The underside of this nostalgia is a widely felt anger that discounts the

onslaught of rock in order to put the blame on jazz for its own banishment from

mainstream culture because of its excesses after 1965. Wynton Marsalis gives

voice to this animosity in statements like this one, from a recent interview

with the critic Leonard Feather: "When you come to New York, there's a whole

school of musicians who are called the avant-garde, and you don't really [need]

any craft requirements to join their ranks. All you have to do is be black and

have an African name...." Were it not for the fact that he has no past deeds of

his own to recant, Marsalis could be the spokesman for the jazz auxiliary of

Second Thought, the coterie of <I>mea-culpa</I>-ing former radicals turned

neo-conservatives. Although Marsalis has expressed admiration for Ornette

Coleman, the erosion of standards in the avant-garde is a recurring theme in

his interviews, and because he neglects to name names, he tars all of Coleman's

progeny with his brush. "It's much, much easier to whip up this hasty,

fast-food version of innovation than to humble yourself to the musical logics

that were thoroughly investigated by [the] masters," he recently complained to

Stanley Crouch, once an avant-garde drummer and firebrand poet but now the jazz

critic most in sympathy with Marsalis's reactionary aesthetic.<p>



<p>



A good many jazz listeners agree with Marsalis, and much of what he says has

the ring of truth. "Just to think of the arrogance behind a statement like 'I

play world music . . . ,'" he told Feather. "You're admitting that you're

giving non-specific, second-hand treatment to different types of music . . . .

" The avant-garde's naive fascination with ethnic music is worthy of Marsalis's

ridicule. But it is good to remember that in addition to toying with African

thumb piano and doussn' gouni and didjeridoo, the avant-garde restored clarinet

and tuba to the jazz ensemble, to say nothing of importing such suspect

"concert" instruments as violin and cello, thus relieving the inherent monotony

of trumpet, saxophone, piano, bass, and drums (the lineup still generally

favored by Marsalis and his followers). It was also such nominal avant-gardists

of the 1970s as Roscoe Mitchell, Joseph Jarman, Muhal Richard Abrams, Anthony

Braxton, Anthony Davis, and Henry Threadgill who rekindled interest in

composition by avoiding theme-solos-theme formats, and who put jazz back in

touch with its pre-Charlie Parker heritage by reinvestigating ragtime, marches,

Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, and Jelly Roll Morton.<p>



<p>



There is no way to turn back the clock on all that has happened in jazz over

the past two decades, nor should we want to try. To his credit, Marsalis <I>has</I>

brought new audiences to jazz, although the critic Steve Futterman is not the

only one who wonders if all that Marsalis has accomplished is to persuade "his

upscale audiences that jazz could be as boring as they'd always secretly

feared." Those of us who are more familiar with the rich diversity of

contemporary jazz know that boredom isn't an issue so long as the music keeps

evolving. Still, it should give anyone pause to consider that all of the most

intrepid jazz experimentalists are now in their forties or older, while the

leading musicians under thirty see themselves as craftsmen making small

refinements in a time-tested art. Progress is frequently a myth in jazz, as in

most other aspects of contemporary life. But it is a myth so central to the

romance of jazz that the cost of relinquishing it might be giving up jazz

altogether.<p>

	<font size=5>J</font>AZZ is upon us everywhere. To deny the fact is to assume the classic ostrich

pose, head buried in the sand, tail-feathers to the sun. To shout alarm

hysterically from the housetops, is to exhibit over-confidence in clamorous

indignation as a purifier of morals, if it be not wholly to ignore historic

precedent.<p>



<p>



The situation we are facing is not new. It offers many problems which are

grave, yet seemingly not more perplexing than those which have arisen, under

similar conjunctures, in the past. True it is that the dance to which jazz

music has been coupled is not precisely setting an example of modesty and

grace. True, also, that certain modern dance-perversions have called up music

that is as noxious as the breath of Belial. Only by a bold stretch of fancy can

this delirious caterwauling be brought under the head of music proper--or

improper; as noise, its significance at times becomes eloquent to the point of

leaving little or nothing to the imagination.<p>



<p>



However, let us remember that the worst of our present dances are not beginning

to approach in barefaced wickedness the almost unbelievable performances of our

forefathers, for which we need not seek much further back than the time of the

French Revolution, when the 1800 dance-Halls of Paris were not enough to hold

the whirling pairs, but dancing went on gayly in churches and in cemeteries.

And let us admit that the best of jazz tunes is something infinitely more

original--perhaps even musically better than the so-called "popular" music that

America produced in the "good old days," that golden age which lives only in

the mythology of disappointed sinners.<p>



<p>



My ideas on the dance and the possible causes of its recurring degeneration I

have set forth in an article, "Why do we dance?" which appeared in the Musical

Quarterly for October, 1920. I shall merely remind you that almost every race

and every age have known social conditions which result in an unloosing of

instincts that nature wisely has taught us to hold well in check, but which,

every now and then, from cryptic reasons, are allowed to break the bounds of

civilized restraint.<p>



<p>



Such excesses have not infrequently attained to tragic madness. The silly, lewd

gyrations for which jazz is held responsible by some are the release of tension

in a witless, neurotic stratum of society. But such dances were common long

before the word "jazz" was coined. Our latest dance craze has known the Tango,

the "shimmy," the various zoological trots, to much the same purpose that now

cries out for jazz.<p>



<p>



Whoever wishes to reform the dance must break the grip that clutches partner

against partner, in shuffling, wriggling ambulation. Abolish the comparative

intimacy of that twofold company; make room for the benign third party that

turns company into crowd; devise a dance in which there is general

participation, as there was in the quadrille, the figure dances, the milder

forms of country reels, and you will not only improve the tone of public

amusements, but possibly you may open a way for dance-music to resume a

swifter, ampler, and more sweeping gait, instead of the repeated, jogging,

stubborn motives which lead to stupid, short, reiterated movements.<p>



<p>



For the present, I am not concerned with dance reform, nor am I interested in

jazz as an accompaniment to Terpsichorean atrocities; it is rather the musical

side of jazz--how it originated, what it represents, and what it may lead

to--upon which I shall try to throw a little light.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>O a great many minds, the word "Jazz" implies frivolous or obscene deportment.

Let me ask what the word "sarabande" suggests to you? I have no doubt that to

most of you it will mean everything that is diametrically opposed to "jazzing."

When you hear mention of a "sarabande," you think of Bach's, of Handel's slow

and stately airs; you think of noble and dignified strains in partitas,

sonatas, and operas of the eighteenth century. Yet the sarabande, when it was

first danced in Spain, about 1688, was probably far more shocking to behold

than is the most shocking jazz to-day. The sarabande seems to have been of

Moorish origin. Then, as now, the oriental, the exotic touch, gave dancing an

added fillip. When Lady Mary Montagu, writing from Adrianople in 1717,

described the dance that she saw in the seraglio of a rich Mussulman, she made

allusions which leave no uncertainty as to the exact nature of these

proceedings. Something of that character must have belonged to the earliest

sarabandes. They were the proud Hidalgo's hoolah-hoolah.<p>



<p>



A French author, Pierre de Lancre, wrote in 1613: "The courtesans who mingle

with the players have given this dance such a vogue on the stage, that there is

hardly a young girl in the country who cannot copy them to perfection." How

truly the same might be said of our generation; it is the stage that starts a

novel mode of dancing, the public which is alert to ape it and outstep it.

Father Mariana, in his book De Spectaculis, published in 1609, devoted a whole

chapter to an attack on the sarabande, accusing it of having done more harm

than the bubonic plague which devastated Europe in the Middle Ages.<p>



<p>



Again, we hear it alleged that the moral corruption worked by jazz is vastly

more calamitous than was the material havoc wrought by the World War. And yet,

as we know, this once objectionable sarabande finally became a matrix wherein

the greatest musical composers have cast some of their loftiest and purest

inspirations. Dances, popular and no doubt shocking in their day, have

furnished the soil for the cyclic growth from which has sprung, by way of the

concerto and sonata, the grandest form of absolute music, the orchestral

symphony.<p>



<p>



What the waltz was when first it set Vienna spinning, when it turned Paris into

one big whirlpool, has been variously chronicled by pious and blushing

witnesses, none of whom was more perturbed than the impious poet, Lord Byron.<p>



<p>

<blockquote>

     Not soft Herodias, when, with winning tread,<br>



     Her nimble feet danced off another's head; <br>



     Not Cleopatra on her Galley's deck <br>



     Displayed so much of leg or more of neck, <br>



     Than thou, ambrosial Waltz.<p>

</blockquote>

<p>



Yet Weber was to vest such bareness in the spacious mantle of his art, and

Chopin crown it with the coronet of quality. I have taken the license of

rapidly rehearsing these few historical facts, to answer those who might

question my saneness in bestowing upon the musical side of jazz so much as a

particle of studious thought. Without speculating what the future development

of jazz may be, what ultimate contribution to musical styles it may make, there

is an excuse for believing that long after the dance known as jazz will happily

have vanished, investigators in the field of musical history will have occasion

to search for the inception of these peculiar tunes, to seek for traces of

contemporary opinion on their merit or their faults. I frankly think that it

would set us down a rather jaundiced lot, if those investigators were to

discover no sign of unbiased appraisement, nothing but wholesale ranting

against a laxity of morals which was inveterate before the frenzied beaters of

pots and kitchen kettles became entitled to full membership in the Musical

Union.<p>



<p>



Let me emphatically state that I in no way sympathize with these perpetrators

of infernal din, who are giving a poor imitation of the admirable savage, with

his highly perfected and astonishingly diversified art of sounding pulsatile

instruments.<p>



<p>



The savage stands far above the clownish tricks of rubbing sandpaper, blowing

shrieky sirens, or hitting at random a battery of gongs. The savage is

immeasurably more cultured than the person who belabors a piano with his whole

body and, thrumming two or three ill-assorted chords, frantically fumbled

together in endless and stale repetition, tries to tell you that he is playing

jazz. As a matter of fact, he is doing nothing of the kind.<p>



<p>



Like any other type of music, jazz can be bad or good. I am not defending bad

jazz any more than I would defend a bad ballad or the bad playing of Beethoven.

I have no intention of standing up for the insolent plagiarists who

misappropriate and disfigure Rimsky-Korsakof, Puccini, and that superlative

master, Johann Strauss. One of the most audacious in this little game is said

to be a good musician, conductor of a practised band, the son of a respected

Supervisor of Music in Public Schools of Denver. (So says the New York Times.)

I am certain that the apostle of vulgarization who should try to rewrite

Shelley's poems in slang would be broken on the wheel and quartered. And I

should be delighted to help set up the punitive machine if musical barbarians

were to be similarly executed. <p>



<p>



So much, then, to clear the stage, and range into a solid background the

protests and restrictions, upon which I shall ask you to fix, from time to time

a reassuring glance, while I step to the proscenium and speak my little piece.

The burden of it is this: there exists such a thing as good jazz music, and

good jazz is a great deal better, and far more harmless, than is a bad ballad

or the bad playing of Beethoven. And, if you are open-eyed in surveying our

musical tendencies, you cannot pass blindly over the unspeakable riff-raff of

our male and female balladists: the "Smile" songs; "Bubble" songs; "Mother,"

"Mither," and "Mammy" songs; the sloppy "Sweetheart" drivel; above all the

unpardonable maltreatment of the classics by the multitude of

amateurs--offenses infinitely worse than good jazz. And to the latter I now

come.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>J</font>AZZ, as a state of mind, is symptom, not malady. Jazz, in the guise of music

is both anodyne and stimulant to the afflicted. To the immune, it is an

irritant. The term jazz, as applied to music, is rather elastic. It embraces

not only the noisy-noisome sort, the jumble-jungle kind, but a type that

refines upon and meliorates the racy stuff of wilder species with matter of a

distinctly and engagingly musical nature. Good jazz is a composite, the happy

union of seemingly incompatible elements. Good jazz is the latest phase of

American popular music. It is the upshot of a transformation which started some

twenty years ago, and culminated in something unique, unmatched in any other

part of the world. Fifteen years ago we had progressed to the insipid "Waltz me

around again, Willie," to the Coon-song and Rag-time factories in the back

parlors of the West Twentieth streets of New York. With the period of

"Everybody's doing it, doing it, doing it," about 1912, we reached the short

insistent motive which was to usurp the prerogatives of songfulness.<p>



<p>



Then, one fine day, in 1915,--or fine night, I should rather say; for, if I

remember correctly, it was in the second act of a mildly entertaining

operetta,--we were treated to "The Magic Melody." A young man, gifted with

musical talent and unusual courage, had dared to introduce into his tune a

modulation which was nothing extraordinary in itself, but which marked a

change, a new regime in American popular music. It was just the thing that the

popular composer in the making had been warned against by the wise ones as a

thing too "high-brow" for the public to accept. They were foolish prophets. The

public not only liked it: they went mad over it. And well they might; for it

was a relief, a liberation.<p>



<p>



Gradually, the courageous young man found imitators more daring than himself.

Harmonic richness and variety entered victoriously where stereotyped cadences,

barren and threadbare progressions, had reigned ad nauseam. Mind you, I am not

setting milestones with the tunes I have named; I merely wish to suggest to you

different stages of a continuous evolution, by songs which were typical of

each.<p>



<p>



I have not given the subject sufficient study to say definitely at what point

the course of popular American music took a new turn, but, unless I am very

much mistaken, "The Magic Melody," by Mr. Jerome Kern, was the opening chorus

of an epoch. It is not a composition of genius, but it is very ingenious. While

it is almost more tuneless than was "Everybody's doing it,"--if that be

possible,--and largely adheres to the short, insistent phrase, it stands on a

much higher musical plane. Its principal claim to immortality is that it

introduces a modulation which, at the time it was first heard by the masses,

seized their ears with the power of magic. And the masses, for once, showed

excellent judgment.<p>



<p>



Mr. Kern subsequently proved to be one of the most fertile, tasteful, and

characteristic composers of light music. When he tries to be purely melodic, he

is apt to fall back upon cheap sentimentalism, tinged with spurious folk-song

color. But his little harmonic device had a hue all its own; and popular

parlance decided that it was "blue."<p>



<p>



A veil of mystery covers the first dark deed that went by the name of "Blue."

Forever hidden, perhaps, is the identity of the melancholic culprit who

perpetrated it, although stout hearts are ready to cite the man, the place, and

the tune. They are not apt, however, to tell you of an ancestral and bona-fide

"blue chord," which Richard Wagner deliberately chose in order to make more

graphic the word blau when Tristan, in the beginning of Tristan and Isolde,

refers to the green, but distant, shore as shimmering still in a blue haze.

That is the sublime instance.<p>



<p>



The ridiculous one is the maudlin glissando on ukulele and steel guitar, the

tear-duct of popular music. What stainless ears considered a rather weird turn

of the melody, a morbid shifting of harmonies, entered the dictionary of

professional jargon as "blue note," or "blue chord."<p>



<p>



I am under the impression that these terms were contemporary with, if they did

not precede and foreshadow, the period of our innumerable musical "Blues." What

the uninitiated tried to define by that homely appellation was, perhaps, an

indistinct association of the minor mode and dyspeptic intonation with poor

digestion; in reality, it is the advent in popular music of something which the

textbooks call ambiguous chords, altered notes, extraneous modulation, and

deceptive cadence.<p>



<p>



The trick had irresistible charm; everybody tried it. It was in the preludes

and interludes of the popular songs that the radicals began to break down the

old order--that is, in those measures where the voice did not interfere with

their freedom. The hackneyed "Till ready" was mercifully dispatched to limbo,

and superseded by some dexterous harmonic tricks that not only stood, but

demanded and deserved, rehearing. Instead of the traditional sequence of

dominant diminished-seventh, and dominant-seventh harmonies--which formed the

time-worn transition into the refrain and accompanied the chanted announcement:

"when he to her did say,"--there sprang up a diversity of the freshest, most

unexpected modulations, which fell upon the ear like drops of evening rain upon

a parched and sun-baked soil. The various shades of blue, in which untutored

harmonists indulged, ranged all the way from faint cerulean to deep indigo. The

last could often be more fittingly compared to mud.<p>



<p>



Between the earlier "rag" and the "blues," there was this distinction: the rag

had been mainly a thing of rhythm, of syncopation; the blues were syncopation

relished with spicier harmonies. In addition to these two elements of music,

rhythm and harmony, the people--who in the beginning had known but one thing:

melody fastened upon a primitive and weak harmonic structure of "Barbershop"

chords--the people, I say, who had stepwise advanced from melody and rhythms to

harmony, lastly discovered counterpoint. And the result of this last discovery

is jazz. In other words, jazz is rag-time, plus "Blues," plus orchestral

polyphony; it is the combination, in the popular music current, of melody,

rhythm, harmony, and counterpoint.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>E</font>ACH of these four ingredients bears racial features which are unequivocally

American. Yet this Americanism is not exclusively a tribal one; it is not

content to borrow from the negro, to filch from the Indian. What marks of

oriental inflections it shows hail from the Jordan rather than from the Congo

River. While the primitive syncopation was taken over from the colored man;

while the Semitic purveyors of Broadway "hits" made us an invaluable gift of

their more luxurious harmonic sense of the contrapuntal complexity of jazz is

something native, born out of the complex, strident present-day American life.

Where did you hear, before jazz was invented, such multifarious stirring,

heaving, wrestling of independent voices as there are in a jazz orchestra? The

saxophone bleats a turgid song; the clarinets turn capers of their own; the

violins come forward with an obligato; a saucy flute darts up and down the

scale, never missing the right note on the right choral; the trombone

lumberingly slides off on a tangent; the drum and xylophone put rhythmic

highlights into these kaleidoscopic shiftings; the cornet is suddenly heard

above the turmoil, with good-natured brazenness. Chaos in order,--orchestral

technic of master craftsmen,--music that is recklessly fantastic, joyously

grotesque,--such is good jazz. A superb, incomparable creation, inescapable yet

elusive; something it is almost impossible to put in score upon a page of

paper.<p>



<p>



For jazz finds its last and supreme glory in the skill for improvisation

exhibited by the performers. The deliberately scored jazz tunes are generally

clumsy, pedestrian. It is not for the plodding, routine orchestrator to foresee

the unexpected, to plan the improbable.<p>



<p>



Jazz is abandon, is whimsicality in music. A good jazz band should never play,

and actually never does play, the same piece twice in the same manner. Each

player must be a clever musician, an originator as well as an interpreter, a

wheel that turns hither and thither on its own axis without disturbing the

clockwork.<p>



<p>



Strange to relate, this orchestral improvisation, which may seem to you

virtually impossible or artistically undesirable, is not an invention of our

age. To improvise counterpoint was a talent that the musicians in the

orchestras of Peri and Monteverdi, three hundred years ago, were expected to

possess, and did possess, to such a high degree that the skeleton scores of

those operas which have come down to us give but an imperfect idea of how this

music sounded when performed.<p>



<p>



A semblance of this lost, and rediscovered, art is contained in the music of

the Russian and Hungarian gypsies. Just as that music is a riotous

improvisation, throbbing with a communicative beat, ever restless in mood, so

is jazz. Just as the gypsy players are held together by an identical,

inexplicable rhythmic spell, following the leader's fiddle in its harmonic

meanderings, each instrument walking in a bypath of its own, so is the ideal

jazz band constituted--that is, the jazz band made up of serious jazz

artists.<p>



<p>



Franz Liszt could give a suggestion of gypsy music on the keyboard. He had a

way of playing the piano orchestrally. There are few people who can play jazz

on the piano. Jazz, as much as the gypsy dances, depends on the many and

contrasting voices of a band, united in a single and spontaneous rhythmic,

harmonic, and contrapuntal will.<p>



<p>



The playing and writing down of jazz are two different things. When a jazz tune

is written on paper, for a piano solo, it loses nine tenths of its flavor. Only

the bitter grounds are left. In that form, also, it is not unlike the clavecin

music of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, of which only the melody was

noted over a figured bass, or "ground."<p>



<p>



Jazz, fortunately, can be preserved on phonographic records for our

descendants. They will form their own estimate of our enormities. If we had

such records of what Scarlatti, Couperin, and Rameau did with their figured

bases, we should need fewer realizations, restitutions, and renditions by

arranger and deranger. Of the people whom I have heard play jazz on the piano,

I can name but two who have impressed me with their uncanny skill with their

infallible musicianship. One of them is a young man in Boston who will play you

the ten piano sonatas of Scriabin by heart (!), one after the other, and, if

you have survived that, will give you some transcendental jazz which, I wager,

you will declare eminently more worth-while than all the metaphysical ramblings

of Scriabin's "third period."<p>



<p>



My other young friend hails from New York; he is an accomplished player of

Chopin and Debussy, yet nowhere quite so much at home as when he seems to grow

another pair of hands, is over all the keys at once, and with the touch of

wizardry, conjures up tonal jazz spooks that leave you baffled but grinning

with delight.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>H</font>ERE is something in music that is a more topical, a more comprehensive

expression of the modern American spirit, than all our coon songs, our

pseudo-Indian wails, the regional songs of a hundred years ago, the tenth-rate

imitations of vile English ballads, the imperfect echoes of French

impressionism. Good jazz is enjoyed by capital musicians, by men who are

neither inordinately immoral nor extravagantly uncultured. It has fascinated

European composers like Stravinsky, Casella, Satie, as Debussy was fascinated

before them by rag-time. "Golliwog's Cakewalk" and "Minstrels" are works of the

purest art, notwithstanding the fact that the essence of their peculiar charm

was filtered from the emanations of the music-hall.<p>



<p>



Maurice Ravel, last summer, told Mr. Edward Burlingame Hill, who was visiting

him, that he considered jazz the only original contribution America had so far

made to music. Nor do American composers of repute disdain to try their hand at

it. Leo Sowerby, the young Chicagoan, who is the first musical stipendiary to

be sent to the American Academy in Rome, has been guilty of sounding the jazz

note in his chamber music and in a piano concerto. No less respectable a person

than Professor Hill himself, associate professor of music in Harvard

University, a man who may be credited with harboring no desire for cheap

notoriety, has signed his name to a "Study in Jazz" which Messrs. Pattison and

Maier have played in their remarkable recitals for two pianos, and which,

arranged for full orchestra, I believe, has been programmed by M. Monteux for

the regular concerts of the Boston Symphony. There is frank and appropriate

tribute paid to jazz in Mr. John Alden Carpenter's "Krazy Kat" ballet.<p>



<p>



What more conclusive evidence could you demand to prove that jazz--good

jazz--is not devoid of musical possibilities, not wanting in musical merit? If

the fastidious musician succumbs to it, can you blame the people of America and

Europe for liking good jazz?<p>



<p>



Perhaps some of my hearers have begun to be agitated with wonder whether I am a

paid emissary of the "affiliated dance-hall proprietors," or a hireling of

unscrupulous publishers and phonograph companies.<p>



<p>



As a matter of fact, in standing up for good jazz I am not making a plea for

the deplorable dances of our day; I am not defending the prurient panders of

the musical fraternity; I am not absolving the indiscriminate manufacturers of

records. Against all three I want to register a loud, emphatic protest. But I

cannot rouse myself to such a pitch of virtuous wrath that blindness is the

result. Nor will I admit that music, at its worst, can be guilty of all the

misdeeds that have been laid to jazz.<p>



<p>



Let the reformer sacrifice his days and nights in the noble endeavor to save

mankind from the diabolic pitfalls which constantly surround it. For one thing,

the champion of righteousness may rely upon the satiety of the public which,

sooner or later, is sure to make an end of every "rage," including jazz dances.

It is more than likely that he does rely on it, and therefore is all the more

enthusiastic in his reform. He has, however, so far overlooked the powerful

assistance that he might derive from bringing into wider prominence the musical

and artistic potentialities of jazz. Nothing will help more speedily to lower

it in the esteem of the public at large than gently to hint, artfully to

suggest, subtly to insinuate, that it may have some vague, remote relation to

Art.<p>



<p>



If jazz music has any of the gypsy music's fitness for survival, it will leave

a trace, unsoiled by memories of indecorum and police raids. Meanwhile, the

curious and heretical inquirer may be pardoned for dwelling reflectively upon

so odd a case as that presented by the gradual accession of melody, rhythm,

harmony, and counterpoint to the leading role in the popular music of America,

a process covering barely more than five decades. It has no parallel in musical

history, unless we take musical progress as a whole during the last five

centuries. Good jazz, once brought into the focus of unclouded criticism,

reveals, aside from the grosser features visible to a naked eye in the dark,

some finer lineaments, which make it appear justly entitled to the benefit of

honest doubt, based--if on nothing else--on the examples of the sarabande, and

the waltz.<p>



<p>



Of course, someone may interpose that we cannot drive jazz, waltz, and

sarabande in one and the same harness; that the musical vehicles of 1922 are as

different from those of 1822, or 1722, as is a snorting eight-cylinder

automobile from a featherweight Tilbury, or a pompous statecoach drawn by

six.<p>



<p>



Quite true. Yet some argumentative and jazz-loving person might come along and

retort that, while the means and speed of locomotion have changed, human nature

has remained stationary, or, at least, much as it always was and will be. Said

person might add to our embarrassment by averring that perhaps the real trouble

is a momentary shortage in Handels, Webers, Chopins. And how shall we prove him

wrong?<p>

	<font size=5>A</font>LTHOUGH Gil Evans is widely regarded as the leading jazz orchestrator after

Duke Ellington, his career has been mottled with the ironies, paradoxes, and

inconsistencies more typical of minor cult figures. Born in 1912, Evans is a

year older than Woody Herman and only two years younger than Artie Shaw. But

his harmonic values, which owe more to bebop and the French impressionistic

composers than to big-band swing, distance him from his own generation. Evans,

who was pushing forty when he initially made an impression on his peers,

nearing fifty when he attained a modicum of popular recognition, close to sixty

when he formed a permanent ensemble, and over seventy when he wrote his first

film score, was a slow starter who might never have gotten started at all

without a shove in the right direction from the trumpeter Miles Davis, in the

late 1940s.<p>



<p>



At that time Davis and Evans must have seemed odd running mates. Davis, still

in his early twenties, had just completed an apprenticeship with the alto

saxophonist Charlie Parker. Parker was the foremost exponent of bebop, which

was then still a radical new form of jazz delighting in the subversion of

pop-song convention. Evans had been an obscure staff arranger for the Claude

Thornhill Orchestra, a sometimes experimental dance band famous for dreamy

ballads like "Snowfall" and "A Sunday Kind of Love." It was admired by the

beboppers for its translucent voicings, which were made possible by an unusual

instrumentation that included French horn and tuba in addition to the

conventional brass and reeds.<p>



<p>



Soon after leaving Parker's group Davis formed a nine-piece band, the Miles

Davis Nonet. Although it was smaller in size than Thornhill's group and it

derived some of its phraseology and rhythmic crispness from bebop, its

instrumentation and palette resembled Thornhill's--it, too, boasted French

horn, tuba, and vibrato-less reeds. Significantly, one of the Davis Nonet's

arrangers was Evans, whose orchestrations of Charlie Parker compositions for

the Thornhill Orchestra had a few years earlier proposed just such a synthesis

of bebop abandon and Thornhillian reverie.<p>



<p>



The 78s that the Miles Davis Nonet recorded for Capitol in 1949 and 1950 (later

collected on an LP titled <I>The Birth of the Cool</I>, now out of print) were

recognized as masterpieces only in retrospect. In part this was because Davis

quickly abandoned this measured approach for an earthier, more casual

improvisatory style dubbed hard bop long after the fact. This suggests that the

<I>sound</I> of the Miles Davis Nonet (its most striking characteristic) was a

reflection more of Evans's sensibility than of that of the titular leader.<p>



<p>



Evans arranged only one of the twelve numbers recorded by the Nonet, and

collaborated with Davis on another. Yet the arrangements by Davis, John Lewis,

Gerry Mulligan, and John Carisi were rife with what would soon become

recognized as Evans trademarks--the shadow play of horns scored across

sections, oppositions of low brass and high reeds, harmonic insouciance

bordering on modality. Like Duke Ellington, who is often assumed to have

written "Take the 'A' Train" and "Things Ain't What They Used to Be," Evans had

mastered the genius's trick of creation by proxy.<p>



<p>



But after those early sessions with Davis he retreated into the shadows, 

until Davis called him back again almost a decade later.  From 1957 to 1959 

Evans arranged and conducted three albums for Davis that rival Ellington's 

showcases for Cootie Williams and Rex Stewart as fully realized concertos 

for trumpet and orchestra.  On the strength of <I>Miles Ahead</I> (Columbia 

PC 8633), <I>Porgy and Bess</I> (Columbia PC 8085), and <I>Sketches of Spain</I> 

(available only on cassette, Columbia CGT 38220), Evans began to finish 

second only to Ellington in the composer-arranger category of jazz 

magazines' year-end popularity polls.<p>



<p>



But "arranger" is too limited a designation for him, and "composer" is too

grandiose. Evans has never been a prolific composer, and few of his pieces have

won acceptance in the familiar jazz repertoire. Yet it is unlikely that Kurt

Weill's "My Ship" and even a more indigenous number like Dave Brubeck's "The

Duke" would have become enduring jazz favorites without Evans's intervention on

<I>Miles Ahead</I>. The wistful countermelody with which Evans lightened and modalized

George Gershwin's "Summertime" on Davis's <I>Porgy and Bess</I> album has since become

part of the composition, as far as many jazz musicians are concerned, although

one wonders how many of them realize that they are paying homage (if not

composer's royalties) to Evans as well as to Gershwin. Much the same is true of

the tempo-changing fanfare that Evans devised to separate Davis's solo from

John Coltrane's on a 1956 recording of Thelonious Monk's "'Round Midnight" on

Columbia. The anxious, floor-pacing vamp with which Evans introduced John

Benson Brooks and Harold Courlander's ballad "Where Flamingos Fly" on a 1956

date for the singer Helen Merrill and on a 1961 date under his own name

recently resurfaced on the guitarist Stanley Jordan's version of John Lennon

and Paul McCartney's "Eleanor Rigby," of all places. And it would be difficult

to imagine "Spain," the pianist Chick Corea's best-known composition, without

the working model of Evans's arrangement of Joaquin Rodrigo's <I>Concierto de

Aranjuez</I>, from <I>Sketches of Spain</I>.<p>



<p>



In one sense, what Evans does is analogous to what a great improviser like

Sonny Rollins does when he bestows his favors on Tin Pan Alley. The difference,

of course, is that much of Evans's "improvisation" takes place beforehand, on

score paper. Like Rollins, he tends to isolate and expand upon discrete

elements of his source materials--an especially provocative passing chord,

perhaps, or an insistent rhythmic vamp, or an unexpected melodic ellipsis--and

discard the rest. As a result, his interpretations have the aura of newly

imagined works, ontologically independent of their inspirations. The best

illustration of this is his 1963 reworking of Kurt Weill's "The Barbara Song"

(on <I>The Individualism of Gil Evans</I>, now out of print), in which he translates

the composer's anarchic staccato into a languid reverie that is more

characteristic of Evans than of Weill, but no less brilliant for that.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>E</font>VANS influence on younger jazz orchestrators rests on his association with

Davis. It can be argued that his albums with the trumpeter--which were

commissions, after all, despite their collaborative nature--misrepresent Evans,

suggesting that he was a formalist, an advocate of brevity and melodic

compression, in a period when other jazz composers and arrangers joined

improvising soloists in recklessly exploring the possibilities opened up by the

advent of the long-playing disc. By 1970, when Evans finally launched his own

big band after several unsuccessful earlier attempts, his music had left

compression behind in a quest for greater expansion. Evans's recent output has

suffered from laxity. Frequently characterized as an exacting conductor around

the time of his albums with Davis, Evans has since become alarmingly

laissez-faire. It was often said of Ellington that he could communicate what he

wanted from his orchestra with no more than a shrug or a nod; Evans sometimes

seems too laconic to make even those gestures. Big bands have traditionally

been characterized as either soloists' bands (the Count Basie Orchestra of the

late 1930s is the most celebrated example) or arrangers' bands (the Basie band

of the late 1950s will suffice). The Gil Evans Orchestra is an anomaly: a big

band led by a great arranger but ruled by its soloists, which, given their

prolixity, may be leaving far too much to chance.<p>



<p>



Even so, few bandleaders offer as much as does Evans at the top of his form--as

he is for much of the two-record set <I>Gil Evans &amp; the Monday Night Orchestra

Live at Sweet Basil</I> (Gramavision 18-8610-1), which was recorded in a New York

nightclub in 1984 but not released until last year. The set has more than its

share of bloat, in the shape of a Charlie Parker blues medley set to a funk

rhythm, and Alan Shorter's "Parabola," each of which consumes an entire LP side

without benefit of thematic material varied enough or improvised solos meaty

enough to justify such elongation.<p>



<p>



But the remaining two sides are richly rewarding. It hardly matters that the

raw material of Herbie Hancock's "Prince of Darkness" is minimal: Evans's

orchestral swirls create the illusion of an ingratiating melody out of a series

of harmonic vacillations, and there is a nicely paced solo by Lew Soloff, the

latest in a long line of versatile players that Evans uses as Miles Davis

surrogates. On Charles Mingus's "Orange Was the Color of Her Dress, Then Blue

Silk," featuring the tenor saxophonist George Adams, Evans's barrelhouse

accelerandos and lusciously vocalized reeds illuminate the erotic turbulence

that quickened all of Mingus's ballads (and the saxophone solo has a yearning

quality that Adams never displayed with the late composer). Evans's treatment

of "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat," Mingus's eulogy for the tenor saxophonist Lester

Young, is slightly less successful, because the featured soloist, the alto

saxophonist Chris Hunter, relies too heavily on double-timed bebop

licks--knowing which soloist to call on is apparently no longer one of Evans's

strengths. Two numbers are reprised from an album of Jimi Hendrix compositions

that Evans made and that is now out of print. As reimagined by Evans, "Up From

the Skies" is a pleasant etude for the entire band, with especially comely

brass figures. But the ambitious "Voodoo Chile" loses its punch about midway

through, and Hiram Bullock's Hendrix-like guitar improvisation fails to conjure

the spirit of the late rocker, whose charm was in the disparity in scale

between his bombastic guitar virtuosity and his mumbled, affectless vocal

delivery. Earlier on, though, there is wonderfully comic braying by Howard

Johnson on tuba, along with atmospheric synthesizer mewling by Pete Levin. Just

the raucous tone of the performance is gratifying, in light of the strained

gentility most jazz musicians bring to rock-and-roll. Johnson, who plays both

brass and reed instruments, is the ensemble's most valuable member--except for

the leader, who plays what he once self-effacingly described as "cheerleader"

piano.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>L</font>IKE all jazz performers of his longevity and standing, Evans is forced to

compete with his past, in the form of reissues. Magnificent though it is in

places, <I>Live at Sweet Basil</I> suffers by comparison with <I>Out of the Cool</I> (MCA/

Impulse 5653, also available on compact disc), an album from 1961 that

resurfaced last year. <I>Out of the Cool</I>'s most noticeable flourish is "La

Nevada," a simple four-bar minor-to-major riff that swells and contracts for

almost sixteen minutes, behind a succession of soloists including the trumpeter

Johnny Coles, the bass trombonist Tony Studd, the guitarist Ray Crawford, the

bassist Ron Carter, and the tenor saxophonist Budd Johnson. "La Nevada" is

clearly the prototype for <I>Live at Sweet Basil</I>'s "Parabola." But what rescues it

from the monotony of "Parabola" is Elvin Jones's and Charlie Persip's

varicolored percussion. Over the past two decades Evans has borrowed much from

post-Beatles pop, to uneven effect. Synthesizers have given him more color to

work with. But the regimented dance patterns of rock and funk, instead of

giving his music more forward motion, have brought it closer to the rhythmic

standstill it has long courted with its slowly dissolving harmonies.<p>



<p>



It might be Evans's recent albums and live performances that are misleading,

not his classic albums with Davis. Evans's lively adaptations of Mingus's

"Boogie Stop Shuffle" and "Better Git It in Your Soul," and his brass

arrangements for the pop singers Sade, David Bowie, Ray Davies, and Jerry

Dammers, among others, paced one of last year's most entertaining

films--<I>Absolute Beginners</I>, the British director Julien Temple's hyperkinetic,

wildly uneven paean to fifties youth culture and CinemaScope musicals, which

was a box-office smash in England but a box-office flop in the United States.

Avoid the U.S. soundtrack release, a single album that excludes Evans's

instrumentals, in favor of Virgin VD 2514, a two-record British import. (Evans

is also credited with helping to orchestrate Robbie Robertson's score for

Martin Scorsese's <I>The Color of Money</I>, but his hand is nearly undetectable.)<p>



<p>



To recommend the <I>Absolute Beginners</I> set over <I>Live at Sweet Basil</I> would be

perverse. The soundtrack played much better on screen than it does on record,

where the absence of improvisational development works against it as real jazz.

But <I>Absolute Beginners</I> at least has greater focus than one has come to expect

from Evans lately, and this may be partly because it was recorded in the

studio, like the albums with Davis and unlike the many in-concert LPs that

Evans has released since 1978.<p>



<p>



Evans belongs back in the studio, where greater focus is a prerequisite, and

where arrangers are in their element. He could go back with his band, if that

is what he wants, but he also deserves an opportunity to be relieved of the

burden of leading a band. He deserves an opportunity to pick the soloists for

an entire album of Mingus or Ellington or Billy Strayhorn or Kurt Weill, for

whom he has long shown a special affinity--or even Stephen Sondheim, whose

compositions have strangely been overlooked by jazz musicians but whose

spiraling harmonies seem tailor-made for the Evans treatment.<p>



<p>



Even a reunion with Davis might be possible. Or maybe Evans could be persuaded

to re-create Thornhill. Or he could come back into the studio for projects of

his own choosing. His concert recordings, though uneven, demonstrate that he

has maintained his creativity remarkably late in his career. The studio is

where that creativity can best be fulfilled.<p>

	<font size=5>F</font>orecasting the paths that big-band jazz might travel is difficult now that

another of its pacesetters has reached the end of his journey. In symbolic

terms, the loss of Count Basie, who died last April, a few months shy of his

eightieth birthday and a year away from his golden anniversary as a bandleader,

is incalculable. Among big-band leaders only Duke Ellington exerted more

long-term influence upon jazz and American popular music. Indeed, Ellington and

Basie are often cited in the same breath as exemplifying everything rich and

grand and irretrievable in the jazz past--the Duke and the Count, the last of a

bygone aristocracy.<p>

Yet Ellington and Basie represented contrasting approaches to the jazz

orchestra. For Ellington, the big band was a blank page, upon which he wrote

the most enduring body of orchestral literature in jazz history. Basie

functioned more as an editor, although his signature was just as plain. Even in

the 1930s, when the Basie Orchestra was enjoying its first national triumph

with its largely unnotated arrangements (the bulk of them credited to Basie),

the leader's piano was less pad and pencil than general-assignment desk,

according to the testimony of his sidemen. "Basie would start out and vamp a

little, set a tempo, and say 'that's it!'" the trombonist Dicky Wells remarked

in his 1971 autobiography, <I>Night People</I>.<p>

He'd set a rhythm for the saxes first, and [the alto saxophonist] Earle Warren

would pick that up and lead the saxes. Then he'd set one for the bones and we'd

pick that up. Now it's our rhythm against theirs. The third rhythm would be for

the trumpets, and they'd start fanning with their derbies . . . . That's how

Basie put his tunes together. He had a big band, but he handled it as though it

were six pieces.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

According to the outside arrangers whom Basie employed with increasing 

regularity beginning in the mid-fifties, band rehearsals generally found 

Basie penciling out everything in their scores he recognized as superfluous 

to the real matter at hand--that ineffable sensation jazz partisans call 

swing, practically a Basie patent.  Although he gave the impression of 

being a laissez-faire leader--delegating musical authority to deputies, 

including the alto saxophonist Marshal Royal and the rhythm guitarist 

Freddie Green--Basie apparently demanded of his sidemen a commitment to 

basics as single-minded as his own.  He seems to have had little tolerance 

for errant behavior off the bandstand; to judge from what his intimates 

say, he had no vices or affectations, save for the captain's hat he wore in 

later years.  ("<I>Count Basie!</I>  Where'd you park the ship, Count?" an old 

Kansas City crony asks him in the film <I>The Last of the Blue Devils.</I>)<p>



<p>



To say that big bands were essentially the domain of composers and arrangers

until the arrival of the Count Basie Orchestra in New York in 1936 would be an

exaggeration, for there were charismatic improvisers in such "composer's" bands

as Ellington's, Fletcher Henderson's, and even Paul Whiteman's. Still, it is

fair to say that Basie deflated some of the pomposity that had attached itself

to the big-band idiom, by encouraging his men to blow the blues as freely in

performance as they might during informal gatherings. Basie deployed the full

complement of horns not so much to frame his soloists as to goad them on with

escalating call-and-response background riffs that ricocheted from section to

section on the greased wheels of a locomotive rhythm section that included

Basie, Freddie Green, the bassist Walter Page, and the drummer Jo Jones. A

spirit of big-band camaraderie infused the unrefined ensemble passages, and

jam-session rivalry fueled the solos, with three pairs of evenly matched

opponents (the trumpeters Buck Clayton and Harry Edison, the trombonists Dicky

Wells and Benny Norton, and the tenor saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel

Evans) locking horns. As if all this weren't excitement enough, Jimmy Rushing

stood out front hollering the blues as if trying to shout down the entire

aggregation.<p>



<p>



This loosening of musical inhibitions was not something the Basie Orchestra, or

any other band, accomplished by itself. Nor was it Basie's major contribution

to jazz. Amid his band's explosions there were subtleties and divinations. For

quite some time jazz rhythm sections had been moving away from a rigidly

syncopated two beats to the measure toward a more rippling and evenly

accentuated four-four, but it took the rhythm team of Jo Jones and Walter Page

to map the route clearly for all to follow. Lester Young presaged bop, cool,

and even free jazz with his reed-thin vibrato (a contest to the beefier tone of

his section mate Evans), his musings on chord substitutions and passing tones,

his peering around bar divisions, and his games of cat-and-mouse with the

beat.<p>



<p>



This great band remains the standard against which all other big bands have to

be measured (Duke Ellington's being <I>sui generis</I>), and it is small wonder that

most come up wanting. The retooled Basie band of the 1950s was a precision

instrument nicknamed "The Basie Machine" by its admirers--a phrase that caught

on with the band's detractors as well. Despite the presence of a number of

competent soloists, including the cornetist Thad Jones and the saxophonists

Frank Foster and Frank Wess, the stars of this band were the arrangers

(including Foster, Neal Hefti, Ernie Wilkins, Buster Harding, and Wild Bill

Davis) who codified the informal Basie style into a tight, instantly

recognizable sound. Yet if this band was noticeably less freewheeling than the

original model, it was no less potent, and judged as an ensemble rather than as

a donnybrook among rugged individualists, it may even have been the superior

unit. One must turn to Ellington to hear a consummation of brass and reeds as

blithe and incandescent as the Basie Orchestra's recordings of Foster's "Shiny

Stockings," Hefti's "Cute," and Davis's hit arrangement of "April in Paris" (a

guilty pleasure, this last item--exhilarating despite its pop-goes-the-weasel

quotes, fake endings, and Basie's coy exhortations of "One more time!"). The

Basie Orchestra of the fifties was a machine whose motor purred; and hindsight

reveals that Basie was right in gear with the larger movements of the period.

The emergence of hard-bop groups, like the Jazz Messengers and the Horace

Silver Quintet, signaled that jazz was returning to basics after a decade of

creeping intellectualism--and Basie, though his music bore scant resemblance to

the hard-bop phenomenon, was a man who had sworn by basics all along.<p>

<font size=5>B</font>ASIE leaves an impressive legacy.  A number of 

collections bear the title <I>The Best of Count Basie</I>, but only one fully 

warrants the superlative: the two-record set of the Basie Orchestra's 

landmark Decca recordings from the late thirties, which includes the 

original versions of "One O'Clock Jump," "Jumpin' at the Woodside," 

"Swinging the Blues," "Every Tub," "John's Idea," and "Doggin' Around"(MCA 

2-4050).  Perhaps the best thing about this <I>Best of</I> is that it whets the 

appetite for more vintage Basie.  A good place to start is with the Bennie 

Moten Orchestra, the outfit that served as incubator for the Basie 

Orchestra in Kansas City in the mid-thirties.  Regrettably, there is not a 

single domestic collection of Basie's work with Moten now available, but 

French RCA Victor has released three double albums devoted to that seminal 

band; Basie figures prominently in two of them, <I>The Complete Bennie Moten</I>, 

Volumes 3/4 (PM 43693) and <I>Volumes 5/6</I> (PM 45688).  Both <I>Good Morning Blues</I> 

(MCA 2-4108) and <I>SuperChief</I> (Columbia 31224) are delightful two-record 

potpourris of Basie's music from the thirties, the latter especially 

valuable because it includes four numbers with just Rushing, Young, the 

trumpeter Carl Smith, and the Basie rhythm section.  (<I>Super Chief</I> only 

scratches the surface.  The rest of the influential 1936-1939 Basie 

small-group sessions were last available spread out over the five 

double-album sets of Columbia's <I>The Lester Young Story</I>, which are now out 

of print--though all five still turn up in remainder bins from time to 

time.)<p>



<p>



The 1940s were a decade of transition for jazz, and some of the changes were

reflected in the styles of the parade of tenor saxophonists who marched with

the Basie band following the death of Evans and the defection of Young: Don

Byas, Paul Gonsalves, Illinois Jacquet, Lucky Thompson, Wardell Gray, and

Charlie Rouse. The best compendium of forties Basie is the two-record import

<I>The Indispensable Count Basie</I> (French RCA Victor PM 43688), although both Blues

by Basie (Columbia PC 36824) and <I>One O'Clock Jump</I> (Columbia Special Products

JCL 997) have plenty to recommend them, not the least of which is that they are

comparatively easy to come by.<p>



<p>



Basie's output during the fifties and the early sixties was staggering, and

most of his best albums from that period remain in print, including <I>April in

Paris</I> (Verve 2641), Basie (popularly known as <I>The Atomic Basie</I>; Roulette

59025),<I>Basie Plays Hefti</I> (Emus 12003), and the two-record sets <I>16 Men Swinging</I>

and <I>Paradise Squat</I> (Verve 2517 and 2542).<p>



<p>



The seventies and eighties witnessed no decline in the quality or quantity 

of Basie's work.  The last decade of his life was the most productive of 

his career, at least in terms of his own coming out as a pianist.  When 

there is a roll call of the great soloists from the Basie Orchestra of the 

thirties, the leader's name is usually conspicuous by its absence.  Long a 

reticent soloist, Basie finally began claiming the spotlight for himself, 

after several nudges in the right direction from his record producer Norman 

Granz.  In addition to documenting the still vital Basie Orchestra on such 

fine Pablo releases as <I>Farmers Market Barbecue</I> (2310 874), <I>Me and 

You</I> (2310 891), and the recent 88 <I>Basie Street</I> (2310 901), Granz 

inaugurated a series of small-group sessions that pitted Basie against 

veteran improvisers of equal caliber.  There were memorable confrontations 

with the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie (<I>The Gifted Ones</I>, 2310 833), the 

tenor saxophonist Zoot Sims (<I>Basie and Zoot</I>, 2310 745), and the blues 

singers Joe Turner and Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson (<I>Kansas City Shout</I>, 2310 

859), as well as several brushes with fellow pianist Oscar Peterson 

(including <I>Satch and Josh</I>, 2310 722), and carefree trio dates with the 

bassist Ray Brown and the drummer Louis Bellson (<I>For the First Time</I>, 2310 

712, and <I>For the Second Time</I>, 2310 878).  All these records point to 

Basie's sustained vigor, his telling economy, and his sneaky wit, and they 

send the listener back to thirties Basie for his bare-bones solos and 

ad-lib intros.  It was always possible to hear echoes of Fats Waller and 

the grandiose Harlem stride men in even the leanest of Basie's 

improvisations, but it also becomes possible, in retrospect, to hear 

premonitions of such modernists as John Lewis and Thelonious Monk in 

Basie's pregnant silences, the illusory bend of his blue notes, and the 

dot-dot-dash inevitability of his figurations.  At last the cat is out of 

the bag: Count Basie was one of the masters of Jazz piano.<p>



<p>



<p>

<p>



<font size=5>B</font>ASIE'S felicities as a pianist notwithstanding, his name will always be

synonymous with big bands. Over the past three decades the Basie Orchestra

suffered bouts of inertia, as any institution sometimes does, but it seemed to

be on the move again in recent years. A week after Basie's death the Willard

Alexander agency confirmed that the Basie Orchestra would indeed soldier on

without its leader. A refusal to let go of the past reduces history to

nostalgia; aesthetically, ghost bands are sweet cheats, no matter how pristine

their intentions. Taking over the reins of the Duke Ellington Orchestra after

his father's death, ten years ago, Mercer Ellington promised to blow the

cobwebs off some of the masterpieces from the twenties and thirties that Duke

had long ignored. But many of the veteran Ellingtonians who had conspired to

give the latter-day Ellington Orchestra its distinctive voice had died or were

to die within a few years of their leader, and many others had retired. Mercer

soon found himself conducting an Ellington Orchestra in name only for audiences

eager to hear a nostalgic medley of Ellington's hits rather than obscure but

historically central Ellington compositions. (Thus the languors of the Broadway

revue <I>Sophisticated Ladies</I>.) Even assuming there can be a Count Basie Orchestra

without Count Basie, can there be a Basie Orchestra without his longtime

sidekick Freddie Green, himself reduced to part-time status by the infirmities

of age?<p>



<p>



Only a few musicians from the golden era of big bands are still out there on

the road. Lionel Hampton continues to put on a terrific show, and the

indefatigable Woody Herman is as vital and amenable to change as ever, even if

his band is no longer a spawning ground for great stylists. Buddy Rich fronts a

big band whenever he is physically and economically able to, and Artie

Shaw--ever the iconoclast--has sent a ghost band on the road, though he is

still very much alive. Benny Goodman's poor health makes recurring rumors that

he will again enter the fray seem like wishful thinking. <p>



<p>



Big bands are an endangered species, if by <I>big band</I> one means a style of

presentation associated with the popular music of the thirties and forties. But

within jazz <I>big band</I> also reveals sheer love of size, and big bands in that

sense are still plentiful--college lab bands; television talk-show orchestras;

busman's-holiday "rehearsal" bands like those that begat the Thad Jones-Mel

Lewis Jazz Orchestra in New York in the mid-sixties and the Toshiko

Akiyoshi-Lew Tabackin Big Band in Los Angeles a decade later; expanded units of

fluctuating sizes and instrumentations led by pantonalists like Sun Ra, George

Russell, and Muhal Richard Abrams, protean composers for whom the orchestra

promises wider compositional latitude, much as it must have for Ellington.<p>



<p>



Still, the downscale economics of jazz ensure that most rehearsal bands will

remain just that, performing before live audiences only rarely. Orchestras like

Russell's and Abrams's tend to exist only in the recording studios, save for

appearances at European festivals and an occasional week at a New York club. It

hardly seems likely that big bands of any kind will ever again enjoy the

widespread popularity that the big swing bands enjoyed in the years leading up

to the Second World War, when jazz and popular dance music were virtually one

and the same. Nothing in jazz is quite as thrilling in quite as many ways as a

roaring big band. But the melancholy fact of the matter is that since jazz has

evolved into an art music of limited popular appeal, contemporary jazz

musicians will have to forgo the luxury of thinking big, except on rare

occasions. The loss of Count Basie hits harder for underscoring everything else

jazz has lost and figures to go on losing.<p>

<blockquote>



	<font size=5>T</font>HE image on the screen is a village street in Nigeria. Brightly dressed people

are clustered in a circle playing drums, giant calabashes, double-reed horns,

and a sort of violin with horsehair strings. Ornette Coleman is standing in the

middle of the circle, switching from alto saxophone to trumpet and back, laying

alternations of skittery runs and long, expressive blue notes into the

simmering stew of cross-rhythms and gutty, jagged melodies. The picture focuses

and refocuses cyclically on the face of a woman, sad or blank or unknowable

like the whitewashed walls of the village. Her ululating rises sharply above

the music like the barking of dogs.<p>



<p>



Behind the television set a collage covers a brick wall. There is an empty

space helmet, a tube oozing green paste, the convolutions of a naked brain, an

ARVN officer with a pistol shooting a suspected terrorist through the head. The

victim is falling in multiple exposure, changing color from flesh tones to a

washed-out gray. A corner is hung with the spirit images of Z. K. Oloruntoba, a

Nigerian who paints ghosts and gods into rich, stylized color canvases full of

disembodied eyes and mysterious protoplasmic movement. Z.K. is hanging his

first New York show downstairs, in the storefront where Ornette often

rehearses. Ornette is in another corner, sighting down a pool cue. "Take aim,

then hit it," he says, dropping one of his stripes into a side pocket. "If you

wait, you lose your aim." The cries of children in the SoHo street float in

through the open third-floor window.<p>



<p>



Ornette's sparkling green tunic creases and his brow knits as he arches over

the pool table. He lives in a world of clear, endlessly permutating images, of

global musics, folk and classical and jazz, that interpenetrate. Not so long

ago he was dissuaded from putting out an early mix of his Columbia album

<I>Science Fiction</I> that had on it an inordinate amount of echo in the horns. He

liked it, he explained, because the echo "made the sound visual, like a

mirror." He calls his orchestral piece <I>Skies of America</I> "a kinetic kaleidoscope

composition." On the television, the Nigerian video tape has been replaced by

the Ornette Coleman quartet performing in Milan. Ornette's trumpet and Dewey

Redman's musette are playing a loose unison, both their voices distinct, like

the unisons in the Nigerian music. On a table in the center of the large loft

are a score for ninety-piece orchestra, notes for Coleman's as yet unpublished

book on his Harmolodic Theory, and a box of specially painted postcards

announcing the opening of Z.K.'s show. "Aren't his things beautiful?" Ornette

asks as he makes another cushion shot. "I met him when I was in Nigeria, bought

his work. And just having it in my possession I learned that, you know . . .

it's harmless and it's there. Eight ball in the corner pocket."<p>



<p>



Whack! "You know, most artists think they're above show business, but an artist

is not a different person; he just has a different title. The fact that you're

an artist doesn't mean that you're not supposed to learn to read and write and

count. It just happens that if you're an artist, you haven't had any time to be

doing lots of other things. I know that when I was going to school I was

learning geometry, history, and science, and also I had an art class. So

education must include all those things as having something to do with the

concept of value in relation to intelligence. I never thought of myself as

being a person that just dealt with music and everything else was irrelevant. I

like the involvement of bringing things into existence that better the life of

people. I love that concept. And whatever it's called, to me that's art. Do you

want to rack up the balls for another game?"<p>



<p>



Ornette's conversation is often like his painting <I>The Circle with a Hole in the

Middle</I>, which graces the cover of his Atlantic album <I>The Art of the

Improvisers</I>. His music manifests the same thought pattern, circling around the

theme, moving far afield, returning to the starting point when you least expect

it, and moving away again, progressing by variations of feelings and ideas,

balanced like Humpty Dumpty on the edge of the void, the hole in the middle of

space and time.<p>



<p>



The Ornette Coleman quartet that debuted in New York at the old Five Spot, in

the fall of 1959, approached the void and, at times, tumbled into it. The

listeners that first night included Leonard Bernstein, Gunther Schuller, Nesuhi

and Ahmet Ertegun, John Hammond, and almost every musician in town. Some heard

formlessness and chaos, others a sound that would radically alter the course of

jazz and inform the work of a generation of musicians to come. "In the music we

play," Ornette said, "no one player has the lead. Anyone can come out with it

at any time." This new approach to group playing looked ahead with its

polyrhythms, geared to exploration rather than to predetermined patterns, and

its melodies that proceeded through a complex of unstated modulations rather

than riding on a cushion of traditional chord progressions. But the music

looked back through the jazz tradition with its collective improvisations and

its personal, speechlike approach to intonation and phrasing, so much like the

ensemble and solo styles of the early Southern and Southwestern blues and jazz

musicians. In the fall of 1971, Ornette reassembled his original quartet to

record <I>Science Fiction</I>. In twelve years the style had become classic, distilled

into the kind of unique, breathtaking perfection that characterized the work of

Lester Young, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, and a handful of other black

innovators.<p>



<p>



By the beginning of 1972 twenty-one Ornette Coleman albums were listed in the

Schwann catalogue. All but one were small group recordings, and all but two or

three of the compositions were Coleman originals.<p>



<p>



"I started writing before I started playing," he explains. "I didn't start

playing until later, because nobody would hire me. But when I went to audition

my tunes for Les Koenig [of Contemporary Records, Los Angeles] he liked me

playing my own music, so I got the date. And yet it's been twelve years and

they're still saying I haven't paid off the cost of the record." For a decade

Ornette channeled his compositional ideas into providing frameworks for his

combo to improvise on. Somehow he found time to write a string quartet and a

piece for strings and woodwinds. Then he was awarded a Guggenheim, which

allowed him to devote more time to writing, and last summer <I>Skies of America</I>, a

full-length work for soloist and symphony orchestra, was given its premiere at

the Newport-in-New York jazz festival.<p>



<p>



In a sense, the composition is "about" the many things that have happened to

Ornette Coleman since March 19, 1930, when he was born in Fort Worth, Texas,

"under America's skies." More specifically, it is about being black, feeling

exploited, working for recognition as an artist and a man in a society that has

often been aloof, condescending, or hostile. He started on the alto saxophone

at the age of fourteen, switched to tenor two years later, and played in

numerous Texas rhythm-and-blues groups. He first left Fort Worth as a

teen-ager, with a carnival band. He was dismissed from the tent show for

playing bebop, stranded in New Orleans, threatened by racist sheriffs in

Mississippi. In Baton Rouge a gang of roughnecks beat him up and threw his

tenor off a hill, so he went back to the alto, which is still his principal

horn.<p>



<p>



He went to Los Angeles with Pee Wee Crayton's blues band and spent the better

part of the fifties there, working at various odd jobs, studying music theory,

practicing and composing whenever he could. He continued to develop his own

expression, and gradually a few musicians began to understand, especially the

trumpeter Don Cherry, bassist Charlie Haden, and drummers Ed Blackwell and

Billy Higgins. Ornette, Cherry, Haden, and Higgins worked with pianist Paul

Bley at Los Angeles' Hillcrest club in 1958, and struck out on their own later

that year.<p>



<p>



During the sixties he was the subject of numerous articles, which either

idealized or vilified him, and a series of "misunderstandings" with record

executives and club owners made him more and more distrustful of the white

middlemen who still control the presentation and dissemination of jazz and

popular music in America.<p>



<p>



"America is a very good country for a Caucasian human being," he says, "because

regardless of what his native tongue is, if he changes his name and speaks

English he could be of any Caucasian descent. And believe me, that is a very

successful form of freedom. If you're black you can change your name, you can

do anything you want to, but the color of your skin defeats you from having the

same privileges as what I just spoke about. This is the tragedy of America.<p>



<p>



"John Lennon says women are the niggers of the world. Well, I guess the Jewish,

the Italian, and the Irish people were the niggers of the white world. But you

can take any Irish or Jewish or Italian person, and when they return from their

job and go home they are returning to an original concept of who they are as a

person. When they're on the street, selling their merchandise or doing anything

to relate to the country in a land of the free, home of the brave situation,

they speak English, take an English name, and that's it. When they get home,

whatever their name is or whatever they are knowing in their ancestral

background, they can live that. And I think that is very beautiful for a human

being to have, where he can go out in the world and make a living for himself

and then come home and have his ancestral roots still intact. That is one thing

that black people here have never yet had. I'll tell you, man, I'm so tired of

feeling that being black in America has something to do with not being white in

America that I find I can no longer be involved in social functions that have

to do with intellectualism or art or racial questions. Knowing the things I've

just said to you, I find myself being totally . . . paranoid about some person

trying to get ahead in life when I'm one of the many persons he can use to get

ahead without feeling that he's doing anything wrong.<p>



<p>



"I would like to have the same support for <I>Skies of America</I> as any artist that

the public has heard and enjoyed. And everybody in their heritage and natural

state of being wants success; no one is basing their involvement in anything on

a negative attitude. I'm speaking about success humanly, intellectually,

racially, financially, and religiously. I mean success in those senses of

knowing that they have something to do with having less enemies and more

friends, or less debts and more objects, less evil and more love, or less

hatred and more happiness. And I don't want someone to pat me on the back and

not truly listen or try to understand the piece of music. I get lots of lip

service that has to do with the value of my work having to always be dictated

to me by people who have no interest in my welfare at all. I've written lots of

music, but not because I wanted to have someone say oh, isn't he a wonderful

writer. I wrote the music because I <I>could</I> write the music, and then secondly I

wrote it because if I hadn't written it down I wouldn't have had any way of

keeping it and explaining it to others.<p>



<p>



"One day I finally realized that all the music I had heard, someone had made it

possible for me to learn or hear it by simply writing it down or repeating it.

So since I became aware that it had something to do with writing, I decided

that was what I wanted to be. That's the concept of <I>Skies of America:</I> to give

people an insight into things that I've done and to show them that they could

also participate with me in doing it.<p>



<p>



"Anywhere you go," he says, "you're going to have some problems with people not

getting into your music. And you're going to get lip service."<p>



<p>



The modern black American composer-improviser is particularly subject to this

lip service syndrome, and to what Ornette calls "a very New York cliche thing:

people satisfying you mentally but never giving you anything that you want."

One reason is that the music of an Ornette Coleman, a Cecil Taylor, an Anthony

Braxton, or a Sun Ra draws on a much wider spectrum of influences than many

listeners have been exposed to. In addition to past and present jazz, there are

the repertoire of modern concert music, the amplification and pulselike beat of

rhythm-and-blues and rock, and the infinitely diverse musical traditions of the

emerging nonwhite nations. The black composer may use in a single piece

elements from any number of these primary sources. Living as he does in Western

urban centers, wired into the output of cultures he would never have come into

contact with a few decades ago, he hears, and uses, any music that comes

naturally to his particular sensibility.<p>



<p>



The more he hears, the more connections he makes. The vocalized scream in

Ornette's sound, for example, is a tone split into its harmonics or overtones.

This practice was characteristic of blues musicians and singers as far back as

the beginnings of "race recordings," and it can be heard in pure African music.

Ngbaka (central African) soloists on the musical bow are able to draw a

multitude of harmonics from the single "ground" tone of the bow's string, just

as a saxophone virtuoso like Ornette runs harmonics over a root that is sounded

simultaneously. But modern European and American "classical" composers are also

interested in harmonics. Iannis Xenakis, for instance, often indicates in his

scores which particular partials of a given tone are to be sounded. The complex

African polyrhythms currently in favor with many jazz groups were finding their

way into modern concert music as early as Varese's 1931 <I>Ionization</I>. And many of

today's major jazzmen were playing "jazz/rock" long before its current vogue,

often because the only jobs they could get were with rhythm-and-blues bands.<p>



<p>



This unusual number of reference points has left much of the new black music in

a commercial vacuum. The music is often too intricate and demanding for the

traditional smoke-filled nightclub, but it has yet to attract the widespread

private and foundation support that would make regular concert hall

performances possible. While some of Coleman's contemporaries, such as Cecil

Taylor and Ken MacIntyre, have accepted positions in the black studies programs

of Eastern universities, others--Pharaoh Sanders, Sun Ra--continue to function

in the nightclub milieu. Ornette, who continues to write for his quartet as

well as for orchestra, and whose recently completed theory book is potentially

a major shaping influence on the younger generation of black

composer-instrumentalists, hopes to utilize all these outlets, provided, of

course, that they become available to him. Since <I>Skies of America</I>'s premiere he

is beginning to feel that maybe he's on an upswing.<p>

Forty-nine years later Xiaostill thinks that Joyce carried his virtuosity too far. He has earned the rightto his reservations: he and his wife, Wen Jieruo, have just finished a laborthat might have humbled Hercules--translating <i>Ulysses</i> into Chinese. "Inold age one should do something monumental," says Xiao, who is eighty-five."This translation is quite monumental." As the name implies ("Ulysses" is a Romanization of "Odysseus"), <i>Ulysses</i>is organized around the Greek myth known as the <i>Odyssey</i>. Homer's sagatells the story of Odysseus, the king of Ithaca, who sails with his army tosack the city of Troy. Odysseus has some difficulty getting back home. Onlyafter ten years, and a goodly number of Boy's Own adventures, is he restored tohis faithful wife, Penelope, and his stalwart son, Telemachus.<p>Joyce masticates Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> and spits it out in his saga of a day(June 16, 1904) in the life of two Dubliners, Leopold Bloom (Ulysses) andStephen Dedalus (Telemachus). Penelope is represented by Bloom'snot-so-faithful wife, Molly. <i>Ulysses</i> does not slavishly follow the<i>Odyssey</i>, though each episode in the ancient tale has a counterpart in themodern one. For example, in one Homeric episode Odysseus descends to Hades, theworld of the dead; in Joyce's version Leopold Bloom--a Jew and therefore, likeOdysseus, an outsider--goes to a funeral. If Homer marks the beginning ofWestern literature, Joyce suggested, <i>Ulysses</i> was its culmination. "Thetask I set myself technically in writing a book from eighteen different pointsof view and in as many styles," he wrote to his benefactress, Harriet ShawWeaver, "all apparently unknown or undiscovered by my fellow tradesmen, thatand the nature of the legend chosen would be enough to upset anyone's mentalbalance."<p>Xiao and Wen don't need to read Joyce's paean to his own genius to appreciatethe mental upsets that <i>Ulysses</i> can produce. "There are places," Xiaosays, "where I think he made it unnecessarily difficult." His fellowtranslators can only agree. <i>Ulysses</i> has been translated into more thantwenty languages, including Icelandic, Arabic, Malayalam, and, fittingly,Irish. Perhaps the surprising thing is not that it has now been translated intoChinese but that the translation is only now available. <p>Much of the delay can be attributed to the antipathy of the Chinese Communiststoward bourgeois liberal Western culture. Joyce's work became caught in theChinese government's straitened view of literature's role--that it should extolthe morally upright deeds of workers, peasants, and soldiers.<i>Ulysses</i>--bawdy, irreverent, and anti-heroic--hardly suits. Nor did theMaoist cultural commissars appreciate the literary merits of <i>Ulysses</i>,considering it too pessimistic, subjective, and personal. And perhaps worst ofall, it was not concerned nearly enough with the great theme of class struggle.Even with the end, in 1976, of the Cultural Revolution, in which China tried topurge all foreign influences (except Marxism) from the land, Xiao and Wen wereconfined to translating only what was deemed to be safe material, such as thework of Henry Fielding, Charles Lamb, and Arthur Schlesinger Jr.<p>So when the two were just about ready to publish their translation, Xiao tookthe precaution of writing a series of articles for the Chinese press describingthe American trial in 1933 that established that <i>Ulysses</i> was not a dirtybook. China would look backward, he argued, if it were to ban or censor thebook six decades later. Xiao also pointed out the book's "progressive" stance:it was anti-anti-Semitic and anti-imperialistic. <p>The strategy worked. Published last year, with no interference, the firstedition of the three-volume translation sold out its 85,000 copies; a secondand a third edition were rushed into print. "We publishers had to be brave totake this kind of risk," says Li Jingduan, the editor of Yilin PublishingHouse, in Nanjing. "I never imagined this book would be so welcomed by theChinese reader." Considering the price--about $15, or roughly a week's wagesfor a high school teacher in China--the sales are phenomenal, and the couplehave become modest celebrities. They keep clippings about their work in twothick albums in their book-cluttered four-room apartment near Tiananmen Square,and clearly enjoy the fuss. Wen positively purrs as she recalls a book-signingin Shanghai that attracted a thousand readers. "Five police officers had tocome to keep order," she says. "Very excellent." The story made the front pagesof Shanghai's newspapers.<p>Xiao and Wen both have traumatic personal memories of times when China was notnearly so accommodating, and see their translation as a major advance forChina's cultural life. "I feel that this translation of <i>Ulysses</i>signifies that China at last has opened herself not only in technology andscience but also in literature," Xiao says.<br><p><br><p.> <font size=5>T</font>ranslating <A HREF="http://astro.ocis.temple.edu/~callahan/joyce.html">Joyce</A> is no party game in any language, of course. Even a simplesentence like "And going forth, he met Butterly" presents dangers. In fact inthe book Buck Mulligan and Stephen Dedalus meet no one named Butterly.Mulligan, Stephen's roommate, is just tossing off a clever remark as he andStephen leave their residence south of Dublin. He is referring, crudely, as ishis wont, to the biblical description of Peter after his betrayal of Jesus:"and going forth, he wept bitterly." In English the allusion is obvious enough.In German, though, after much cogitation, the thought has been put this way:they went forth "<i>und weinte Buttermilch</i>"--or "and wept buttermilk." InChinese it is translated for sound: they "went out and met Ba Teli," meaning"to hope earnestly-special-inside," but in context signaling a group of foreignsounds. Well, okay: the reader is clued in that the phrase is more than itseems. But a lot is lost in translation.<p>Another example: Stephen recalls that he has borrowed a pound from the poet andwriter George Russell, who styles himself "A.E." Thinking of his debt, Stephenpuns "A.E.I.O.U." In the German, Italian, Czech, and Latvian translations, theexpression is simply left as it is, which must be rather baffling to readers.Most others include a native-language gloss. In the 1929 French translation thepassage reads "A.E. <i>Je vous dois</i>. I.O.U." In Spanish it is "A.E. <i>Tedebo</i>. I.O.U." In Hungarian the vowels are changed, killing the joke:"A.E.K.P." The same is true in Croatian, where an explanation is also added:"A.E.J.V.D (<i>Ja vam dugujem</i>)." "You can only do your best," says FritzSenn, of the Z&uuml;rich James Joyce Foundation. Senn is an authority on Joycetranslation. "But of course, if a joke is explained, it is no longer funny."Right. Is there any way to translate Stephen's witticism about Shakespeare'swife: "If others have their will, Ann hath a way"?<p>Many languages at least share the Roman alphabet, and therefore, to varyingdegrees, a common corpus of sounds. The name Leopold Bloom looks and soundsmuch the same from Dublin to Detroit, from Harare to Hanoi.<p>Enter China and the rules change. To begin with, there are only 404 possiblephonetic combinations in Mandarin, far fewer than in English. Wordplay isinevitably distorted. And Chinese is ideographic, not alphabetic; "home," forexample, is represented by a stylized picture that has traditionally beeninterpreted to be a pig beneath a roof. <i>Ulysses</i> is not pictorial butaural, and comes alive most vividly when read aloud.<p>To make things more difficult, Chinese is a tonal language. In Mandarin, theofficial national tongue, there are four possible tones to each sound: highlevel, rising, falling rising, and falling. The tones make a difference. For acrude example of the sounds, consider using the word "Ma" in these differentcontexts: "Oh, Ma!" in surprised anger at seeing your mother where sheshouldn't be, "Oh, Ma!" in exasperation, "Ma" in sober conversation, and "Oh,it's Maaa" in warning at an unexpected phone call from the matriarch. InChinese, tones change the meaning of a word, not just the emphasis. The fourtones for "<i>ma</i>" mean, respectively, "mother," "hemp," "horse," and "tocurse." (A fifth tone for "<i>ma</i>," which is actually atonal, turns asentence into a question.)<p>Proper names are not always translated syllable for syllable. If "America" wereto be written sound for sound--that is, one Chinese character for eachsyllable--it could be construed as "inferior beautiful beneficial addition."That's not a bad metaphor for Chinese ambivalence toward our country, but thestandard term for America is actually <i>mei guo</i>, which sounds like"America" said with a mouthful of marbles. At least the name translates well:"Beautiful Country." Sometimes names are assigned with reference not to soundat all but to the way China understands the world. This magazine, for example,named after a great body of water, is translated as "<i>The Great Western OceanMonthly</i>."<p>And finally, normal Chinese discourse is sometimes best translated loosely.When Americans see each other on the street, they ask, "How are you?" But whentwo Chinese acquaintances meet, they greet each other this way: "<i>Chi lema?</i>"--literally, "Have you eaten yet?" That does not call for a recitationof the day's diet any more than "How are you?" is an invitation to describeone's fitness program. Therefore, in translating Chinese into English, "<i>Chile ma?</i>" becomes "How are you?"<br><p><br><p> <font size=5>S</font>o it's no wonder that Xiao was not altogether thrilled when a Chinesepublisher suggested in 1990 that he undertake a translation of <i>Ulysses</i>.Pity the poor soul who has to deal with a fairly typical scrap of<i>Ulysses</i> like this one:Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of allhorse.Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the street: veryperipatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through spaces smaller thanred globules of man's blood they creepy-crawl after Blake's buttocks intoeternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow. Hold to the now, thehere, through which all future plunges to the past.I asked Judy Arase, a translator, to find this passage in the Chinesetranslation and then, without reference to <i>Ulysses</i>, translate it fromthe Chinese back into English. Here's the result: How about laying bare your dagger-like definitions? That which is the nature ofa horse is the essence of all horses. They revere the up-down flow andsurging-beginning. God: cries in the street. Downright leisure school ofthought. Space: the thing you are bound to see. They slowly crawl towardseternity, boring through spaces smaller than man's red blood cells, chasingafter Blake's buttocks. This vegetable world is only but its shadow. Holdtightly to the here and now; all of the future shall surge into the pastthrough it.The translation is inventive and carries something of the texture of Joyce'sprose. Still, it's not quite the same: for one thing, it's far toointelligible.<p>Wen was undaunted by the complexities; indeed, she was positively eager to takea crack at Joyce. Then sixty-two, and recently retired from a career as atranslator of Japanese and the editor of other people's English translations,she felt it was time to put her skills to the test. "In Chinese there is anexpression, `Only the head, not the tail'"--meaning that a work has beenstarted but not completed. "For forty years I only polished the translations ofothers. I never had a chance to translate a famous book, a classic. Why not<i>Ulysses</i>?" Eventually she persuaded her husband that they could crack ittogether. The project has been an act of teamwork from the beginning, with Wendoing the first draft, Xiao applying the polish, and the two of them arguingover the final version.<p>Beginning in October of 1990 they set the following schedule: Rise at 5:00 eachmorning (Wen often had to rouse her less committed husband), work until 8:00,and pause for breakfast. Then work until lunch, and again into the lateafternoon. Wen worked nights and weekends as well, putting in, she figures,fifteen hours a day just about every day. She even gave up television andnewspapers. For two years her sister took over the household, doing theshopping, cooking, and cleaning, so that the couple could work. The sister diedin 1992; the translation is dedicated to her memory.<p>The couple leaned heavily on published sources to untangle Joycean knots; theycite Don Gifford's annotated <i>Ulysses </i>as a particular help. Theyconsulted the Chinese Catholic Church, foreign-language specialists,geologists, doctors, and others for specialized knowledge. The Irish Embassyhelped with specifically Irish references. What's "blarney"? Wen asked. Theanswer, as translated: "flattery as usual." And "on the shaughraun"? A driftingstate of mind. The embassy also provided reference books, maps of Dublin, and avideotape of the movie version of <i>Ulysses</i>, which was invaluable becauseWen and Xiao have never been to Ireland. A Canadian resident in Beijing helpedresearch linguistic oddities like "smutty moll for a mattress jig" --Joycespeakfor "prostitute."<p>Xiao and Wen were also able to refer to a work in progress by a man named JinDi, a Chinese literary scholar now living in the United States, who began hisown Chinese translation of <i>Ulysses</i> in 1978 but has not yet seen all ofit into print. Bits of Jin's work had been published by the time Xiao and Wenbegan theirs, and they acknowledge that they saw these, though not the twelvechapters that had appeared in Taiwan by 1993. Jin is somewhat chagrined that hehas been working longer and yet is finishing later. But there is room for morethan one Chinese translation. The Japanese, after all, are on their fourth.Xiao and Wen do not claim that their work is flawless; they are, however,delighted to have published first. "A gold medal is better than the silverone," Wen says.<p>The work is not, in fact, flawless. A sharp-eyed Chinese reader has pointed outa few mistaken translations from the Latin. More important, sometimes thingsare just missed. <p>Molly and her lover, Blazes Boylan, eat Plumtree's Potted Meat during theirassignation; the term is translated as "plum tree trademark canned meat." Goodenough, but it misses the pun: "potted meat" was Dublin argot for sex. WhenLeopold recalls Molly's description of the plump Ben Dollard, that his finesinging voice was a "bass barreltone," the translation does not embody the playon words. His voice and shape, she is saying, are derived from barrels of Bassbeer. Joyce experimented with different ways of expressing cat sounds:"mkgnao," "mrkgnao," "mrkrgnao," and, prosaically, "miaow." In Chinese, whichdoes not have the array of sounds English has, the characters don't change.<p>Still, Xiao and Wen don't miss much. First, they adapted Chinese-language toolsto the challenge. Most Chinese names have three syllables (Deng Xiaoping, MaoZedong, Zhou Enlai); the Chinese transliterations of Leopold Bloom and StephenDedalus have seven each. Stephen's is rendered phonetically--"<i>Si di fen . Dida le si</i>." The unusual number of characters, the midline period betweenthem, and the use of a few classical (rather than simplified) Chinesecharacters are all unmistakable signals to the Chinese reader to ignore themeaning and just note that it signifies a name. (A literal translation would be"This-base of a fruit-fragrant. Enlighten-extend-coerce-this.") The practice issimilar to using "#%*&amp;!" to indicate a curse in English; a reader doesn'tdelineate each symbol but just consumes the meaning. Bloom, wandering through anewspaper office, reads in type the name of the friend whose funeral he hasjust attended: mangiD kcirtaP (Patrick Dignam backward). In Chinese the eightcharacters used to render the name are likewise reversed. When the moral pubowner, Davy Byrne, "smiledyawnednodded all in one," the issue was trickier.Chinese characters are never smooshed together. Xiao and Wen used a quirk ofChinese grammar that implies simultaneously occurring actions.<p>They also adapted Chinese styles to Joycean ones. Molly, Leopold, and Stephenall have interior monologues, and all sound different. Molly is not very welleducated. She occasionally misuses difficult words, and her thoughts, in thefamous soliloquy that ends the book, have an earthy resonance. Stephen, theteacher and literary scholar, is philosophical. And Leopold is a middle-classbloke with a big heart who often thinks about sex and bowel movements. So inthe Chinese, Molly is rendered in working-class Beijing slang, Stephen mostlyin classical Chinese, and Leopold mostly in a mixture of modern and classicalthat dates from the early twentieth century. By varying the styles, thetranslation manages to convey the differences in character among the three.<p>When there is no linguistic or literary analogue, which is most of the time,footnotes do the job. So much of <i>Ulysses</i> is built around puns,allusions, and time- and place-specific Irish humor that it really cannot betranslated; one must simply plough through. Wen and Xiao made the most readableChinese translation they could and then explained the Joycean quirks infootnotes--5,991 of them, the most in any Chinese book ever published. Xiaothought that was several thousand too many, but Wen prevailed. The reviews inthe Chinese press pay tribute to the couple's thoroughness, and howeverunwieldly the footnotes may be to read, they are the only way to clue Chinesereaders in to Joyce's intentions. <p>Take the pun on Shakespeare's wife, Anne Hathaway (whose name Joyce misspells,incidentally). The translation reads "If other women are capable of followingtheir hearts for that which they desire, Ann herself has her own ways." Afootnote makes the point that the original is a pun on "Ann Hathaway."Sometimes--a lot of the time--the explanations are considerably more complex.T. Lenehan bumps into Bloom at a newspaper office and announces, "Madam, I'mAdam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba." In the Chinese text this is translated"Madam, I'm Adam. And before seeing Eve, I was Abel." The footnote fills in theconsiderable gaps: These two short sentences can be read the same from either end, joined togetherby "and." "Eva" [Eve] and "Elba" have similar pronunciations. The sound of Adamand Eve's second-born son, "Abel," is similar to "Able"; the quotation can beread as "Madam, I'm Adam. Before seeing Eve, I was Abel." Another reading comesfrom mixing together the several elements of Napoleon's saying that there is no"cannot" in his dictionary, his post-defeat banishment to the island of Elba,and his impotence; the first phrase can be reconstituted as "Mad am, I mad am,"and the latter as "Before seeing Elba, I did not know the word `cannot.'""Able" can be understood as "can be done" or "not impotent." Elementary, really.<p><br><p><br> <font size=5>A</font>nthony Burgess, no mean Joyce	scholar, has said, "Literature cannot betranslated, only the appearance of literature, the arrangement on a page ofwords which do a minimal job, that of describing action, feelings, and dialogueof a fairly easily translatable kind."True enough, and yet . . . so what? By the Burgess standard, theEnglish-speaking monoglot would be cut off from Tolstoy, Garc&iacute;aM&aacute;rquez, and Lu Xun. And even if the poetry doesn't always rise, action,feelings, and dialogue count too. One of the joys of <i>Ulysses</i> is justgetting lost in the pub talk and the commonplace to-ings and fro-ings of dear,dirty Dublin. The texture may not--cannot--be exactly the same in Chinese as inEnglish, but it is possible to get a rude, true sense of it. <p>Joyce himself was a gifted linguist who spent his working life as an instructorof languages. He must have known that if <i>Ulysses</i> fulfilled its destiny,it would inevitably find a home beyond English--itself a foreign import toIreland. In fact, the first translation of <i>Ulysses</i>, a German effort in1927, came out before the book could be legally published in the United Statesor Britain. It is difficult to believe that Joyce, hardly parochial in his ownwork, would frown on the labors of Xiao and Wen. For if <i>Ulysses</i> is theend of literature, as Joyce believed, the remaining eternity must includeChina, the world's longest-lived civilization. <p>There are limits, though. No one in China is offering to translate <i>FinnegansWake</i>. </blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

	<font size=5>T</font>HE relationship between jazz and "serious" music has been a touchy subject for

seventy years. Critics have portrayed jazz as either a primitive folk music or

the real classical music of this century. Throughout his life Duke Ellington

found himself right in the middle of this controversy. He played his music at

the Cotton Club and at Carnegie Hall. Where did it belong? The true home for

Ellington's music has yet to be determined, but a steady outpouring of new

recordings and criticism allows us to achieve a fresh view of his vast

legacy.<p>



<p>



Mark Tucker's Duke Ellington Reader (1993)--a 500-page anthology of writings

about the Duke, the contents of which are illuminating, sobering, maddening,

and occasionally inspiring--documents a mixed history of appreciation and

incomprehension behind the current movement to elevate Ellington to the highest

ranks of twentieth-century composers. This status is assumed by the Smithsonian

Institution in its exhibition "Beyond Category: The Musical Genius of Duke

Ellington," which is in the midst of a three-year tour of the country, and in a

pedestrian 1993 biography by the curator of the exhibit, John Edward Hasse.<p>



<p>



The Smithsonian acquired a huge collection of Ellington material from the

composer's family in 1988. It should keep musicologists busy for the next

several centuries. Neither the exhibit, which seems aimed at the very young,

nor Hasse's biography, which reads like a coffeetable book, reveals any

surprising new insights into the man or the music. No matter: the music is what

counts, and with every passing month new Ellington CDs appear, covering his

entire recording career, from 1923 to 1973.<p>



<p>



Yet despite the musical evidence, Ellington remains controversial. In his 1987

biography of Ellington the curmudgeonly critic James Lincoln Collier raised the

question of whether Ellington should be considered a composer at all, on the

grounds that he "rarely wrote out a composition in complete form" and that so

many of the works were composed collaboratively. In his biography Hasse

questions Collier's evaluation of Ellington. But Hasse does lend considerable

substance to the charge that many of Ellington's compositions were in fact

written by or with others--a situation not always accurately reflected in the

copyright.<p>



<p>



The who-wrote-what question is, however, a red herring. None of the musicians

with whom Ellington composed--not Bubber Miley, not Johnny Hodges, not Juan

Tizol, and not even Billy Strayhorn, Ellington's classically trained, musically

distinctive alter ego--produced significant music when separated from him.

Ellington had a genius for making music out of other people's music.<p>



<p>



Ellington was an assembler. His band and his compositions were collections of

instrumental colors and musical styles brought together by his guiding

sensibility. Although he created many original melodies from distinctively

chromatic and wide-leaping lines (as in "I Got It Bad" and "Prelude to a

Kiss"), and was arguably the most advanced jazz harmonist of his time, he

constructed many of his pieces with familiar phrase units, which gained new

meaning through surprising juxtapositions. Many Ellington pieces incorporate

bits of blues, harmonic progressions based on ancient jazz like "Tiger Rag,"

tune structures from Broadway standards, and actual melodies from other

people's songs. These allusions and transformations were not criminal acts of

plagiarism; they were a compositional method.<p>



<p>



Once we view Ellington in this light, we can place him head to head with the

other great musical pickpocket and assembler of twentieth-century music: Igor

Stravinsky. After all, both composers turned Chopin's Funeral March to their

own ends (compare the beginning of Stravinsky's Piano Concerto with the end of

"Black and Tan Fantasy"), and both dared to reharmonize "The Star-Span-gled

Banner" and recompose large chunks of Tchaikovsky. And each relied on a close

collaborator--Strayhorn for Ellington, Robert Craft for Stravinsky-- to

function as a composer. Most important, both were able to transform almost any

available musical material through the power of an instantly recognizable

style.<p>



<p>



Some music grows like a plant from a seed, gradually evolving toward its

ultimate goal--call it organic. Other music sounds pasted together and shows

its joins--call it cubist. And some music seems to express a timeless

perfection--call it geometric. Geometric form is rarer in a medium as

provisional as jazz, but you can hear it in such well-polished pieces as Art

Tatum's "Willow Weep for Me" and Fletcher Henderson's "Down South Camp

Meeting," that anthem of the swing era. Listening to a Sonny Rollins solo, in

contrast, we hear an idea gradually unfold and build, often over many

choruses.<p>



<p>



Ellington's music is different--more compact and contrived than Rollins's, less

stable than Henderson's. Listen to "Harlem Airshaft" (1940) after "Down South

Camp Meeting." They belong to the same up-tempo genre, and yet the Ellington

composition sounds more complicated, dense, and disorienting. Both pieces are

in three sections. In the Henderson the outer sections create an architectural

balance, a symmetrical frame for the main tune. Ellington begins "Harlem

Airshaft" with several short, disconnected phrases, each in a different key,

which forecast the different musical ideas to come. This rapidly cross-cut

sneak preview sets up the final chorus, which superimposes the three ideas of

the piece. From beginning to end the musical themes--all of them swing-era

commonplaces of no particular originality--appear in a state of active

contrast, not static balance. If Henderson's piece is pure swing, Ellington's

is second-degree swing--swing about swing. <p>



<p>



Yet at the same time, Ellington's tour de force of counterpoint and structure

is a pure jazz composition, a typical "I Got Rhythm" spinoff so unassuming in

its ingenuity that some critics, including Gunther Schuller, dismiss it as not

much more than a series of cliched riffs. To make complexity seem effortless is

the hallmark of a great stylist. Ellington's music is as elegantly put together

as were his suits, shirts, and ties--and his stage persona. (Stravinsky was

also quite a dresser.)<p>



<p>



Ellington's orchestra was, uniquely, an ensemble of individuals. Its

distinctive sonority began with the 1920s "jungle style" of Bubber Miley's

plunger-muted trumpet, which was soon confirmed by the growl and plunger sound

of Joe "Tricky Sam" Nanton's trombone and then amplified by Harry Carney's

baritone sax. The three components of the jungle style come together in "East

St. Louis Toodle-Oo," with its distinctive blend of sass and pathos.

Significantly, the sound of the piece as a whole comes from a blending of

idiosyncratic personal styles and instruments from different choirs. At the

time it appeared, in 1926, it sounded like no other jazz.<p>



<p>



The jungle style, with (for better or worse) its Cotton Club associations,

would make Ellington famous, but he soon introduced very different elements

into his band--namely, two performers whose style derived from Sidney Bechet,

the master of blues inflections whom Ellington later called "the foundation."

Johnny Hodges and Barney Bigard brought a sensuousness to the band through

their liquid arabesques of sound and continuous bending of pitch, which

counteracted the rough gutbucket quality of Bubber Miley (and later Cootie

Williams), Joe Nanton, and Harry Carney. This contrast might have given another

band an identity crisis. For Ellington it became a principle that he pursued

further: by 1940 the sound of the band was built of sharply contrasting

sonorities within each instrumental section.<p>



<p>



Ellington's precise command of individual colors within his orchestra recalls

Rimski-Korsakov's principle that an orchestrator should assign melodies only to

instruments uniquely equipped in register and tone color to play them--a

principle perfected by Ravel and Stravinsky.  Ellington applied this idea not

just to instruments but to specific performers: in his scores he assigned lines

by name of player rather than of instrument. This approach had a drawback, in

that it left the repertory of the band exposed to changes in personnel. Between

the start of the famous Ben Webster-Jimmy Blanton recordings of 1940 and 1941

and the 1943 Carnegie Hall concert, Cootie Williams and Barney Bigard left the

band, and Blanton, whose bass playing transformed its rhythmic feeling, died

tragically at the age of twenty-three. It was to be another decade before

Ellington's orchestra achieved a recognizable and stable cast of players.<p>



<p>



To some critics the dispersal of the "classic" 1940 band marked the end of

Ellington's significant contribution to jazz. I think they undervalue the

pleasures provided by the Ellington band of the fifties, which featured the

heady gin-and-dry-vermouth mixture of Jimmy Hamilton's classical-style

clarinet, Clark Terry's whimsical flugelhorn, and Ray Nance's sinuous violin.

But then, I have always had a fondness for the artsy, even louche, side of

Ellington, which made many of his critics uneasy.<p>



<p>



By the sixties Ellington had turned his personnel problems into a strength by

recording with musicians outside his band such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis

Armstrong, Coleman Hawkins, Charles Mingus, and John Coltrane. Now all of jazz

history became, in effect, his band. In this series of collaborative recordings

Ellington assembled a jazz canon thirty years before the notion of classic

jazz. (The ultimate collaboration--the joint recording of the Basie and

Ellington orchestras made in 1961--reveals an unintended historical irony: by

the time the two bands met, they had lost their individuality to such an extent

that they seemed indistinguishable.) In 1963 Ellington created one of the first

classic big-band anthologies with Recollections of the Big Band Era, a

recording that combines reverent reconstructions of charts by Henderson and Sy

Oliver with savage deconstructions of Guy Lombardo, Stan Kenton, and George

Gershwin. I doubt that any of today's jazz-repertory orchestras would allow

themselves such creative liberties--but then, as Stravinsky said when he was

criticized for rewriting Pergolesi, Tchaikovsky, and Gesualdo: "You respect but

I love."<p>



<p>



Jazz rarely confronts us with the temporal anxiety on which so much classical

music depends. In most jazz performances the form is simply a repeated harmonic

framework within which improvisation can happen. Where the large classical

forms create interest by postponing events in order to establish a sense of

arrival, jazz usually delivers its goods "in the moment," in the music critic

Francis Davis's phrase. Sitting in a club, we listen to an open-ended series of

choruses, happy to be present when a great soloist has time to stretch out.<p>



<p>



Historically, however, there are two unrelated sources of a more articulated

jazz form: the lingering influence of ragtime and the three-minute playing time

of the 78-rpm record. The ragtime form stemmed from "Stars and Stripes Forever"

and similar popular marches, which were built in parade style, usually from

three different tunes, the most memorable saved for last. Many of Scott

Joplin's rags followed a similar three-tune pattern, which persisted in jazz.

Ellington showed less interest in adhering to the strict formal outlines of

ragtime than in the larger idea of building a piece out of more or less

dissimilar parts.<p>



<p>



Ellington's formal mastery is no secret. The French jazz critic Andre Hodeir

devoted twenty pages of heated existentialist prose to the formal design of

Concerto for Cootie. (You can smell the Gauloise in a sentence like "Concerto

for Cootie is a masterpiece because it shows the game being played for all it

is worth, without anything's being held back, and because the game is won.") In

the concerto we see Ellington the cubist at his most refined. In order to bring

out different aspects of his trumpeter's style, Ellington assembles three

elements: a call-and-response tune played with the mute, an eight-bar growled

blues, and an exuberant Armstrong-style melody for the open horn. All are

connected by short linking passages of two or three bars, which give the whole

structure a flexible, sprung unpredictability.<p>



<p>



Even the arrival of a bona fide Kansas City slugger like Ben Webster did not

deflect Ellington from his constructive experiments toward the looser approach

of the Basie band. "Cotton Tail," a showcase for Webster and Ellington's

nearest approach to Kansas City style, builds to an explosive frenzy through a

calculated mixture of expectation and surprise. There are six statements of a

standard "I Got Rhythm" structure, and five of them contain a land mine. After

a series of increasingly energized swerves and surprises, the final phrase of

the final chorus repeats the opening tune--just once, with no padding or

extension--and then it's over. Stunned by the elegant succinctness of the

conclusion, we can hear that the piece was a brilliant ruse: a battle royal

between Webster's sax, which is amplified into the Supersax team of the fifth

chorus, and the brass section, Ellington's loyal commandos. Guess who wins.<p>



<p>



Although many critics honor Ellington as a creator of miniatures, or

three-minute masterpieces, his extended works are more controversial. Critics

of Black, Brown and Beige, one of the longest of all his compositions, are

nearly unanimous in blaming the music's failure on Ellington's allegedly

defective formal sense. The piece, they say, is too long and too diffuse, and

Ellington did not have the skills (that is, conservatory training) to sustain

such a long structure. <p>



<p>



Other composers, such as Gershwin and William Grant Still, did apply symphonic

devices to jazz material, and the results are jazz-tinged symphonic music, not

jazz. Ellington always composed his music from the formal resources of jazz as

he understood them. He built his longer pieces, as he built his shorter ones,

out of the four-, eight-, twelve-, and thirty-two-bar units of the blues and

the standard popular song, though he frequently stretched these units by a bar

or two and inserted short linking passages. There were no useful precedents for

this kind of large structure, and so Ellington experimented with a number of

different approaches to it. Black, Brown and Beige (1943) and Harlem (1951)

combine the results of his previous formal research in richly articulated

structures that are episodic yet intertwined--and that "tell a story." The

variety of Ellington's formal devices amply proves that he did not suffer from

a lack of conservatory training in form any more than in orchestration, another

supposedly arcane field.<p>



<p>



Ellington's creative career, like Stravinsky's and Beethoven's, can be divided

into three periods. The "late period" of all three composers was long viewed

with suspicion. There are several simple explanations for the neglect of the

later Ellington. With the rise of rock, he never produced a hit tune after

"Satin Doll" (1953)--much to his dismay, for he counted on his pop-tune

royalties to subsidize the band. Despite the lack of hit tunes, Ellington's

late period was one of great fecundity and invention, ranging from a constant

stream of pieces played once and forgotten to the pungently noir symphonic

score for the film Anatomy of a Murder, the joyful, witty ballet music for The

River, and the three Sacred Concerts, whose mixture of naivete and the sublime

may someday be heard in relation to The Magic Flute. Much of his late music

took the form of suites written for festive premieres, sometimes in

collaboration with Strayhorn, which cover a huge amount of expressive

territory. The earliest, the 1944 Perfume Suite, opened up an avenue of erotic

speculation that would reach its fulfillment twenty years later in Charles

Mingus's The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady.<p>



<p>



If I had to single out one masterpiece from Ellington's late period--one to

place alongside Stravinsky's Agon--my choice would be the Shakespearean Suite,

otherwise known as Such Sweet Thunder (recently re-released on CD by Sony).

Both these youthful works were completed in 1957, when Stravinsky was

seventy-five and Ellington fifty-eight. Both are suites of short dances which

take as their subject a world of the late Renaissance--French court ballet and

Elizabethan theater, respectively--and evoke that world through the

unmistakable styles of their composers. The works also invade each other's

territory. Agon has several jazzy moments, particularly in the Bransle Double.

Though Stravinsky rarely had anything good to say about jazz, and to my

knowledge never even mentioned Ellington in his writings, he frequently made

use of jazz figures, notably in the Ebony Concerto, written for Woody Herman,

and Symphony in Three Movements, both of which appeared two years after Black,

Brown and Beige.<p>



<p>



Although Such Sweet Thunder is clearly Ellington-Strayhorn jazz, it trespasses

boldly into the world of art music. Four of the movements are written as

sonnets, following the fourteen-line iambic pentameter design of the poetic

form--Stravinsky called this process of turning poetic meter into music, which

he used in Apollo, "versification." Each of these sonnets gives an Ellington

soloist a chance to speak through his instrument, thereby connecting the

Elizabethan soliloquy with the talking-horn wa-wa technique perfected by Joe

Nanton.<p>



<p>



Three movements give us Shakespearean portraits within recognizable Ellington

genres. Othello appears in the title number, a series of African-tinged blues

choruses, jaunty yet mysterious, recalling "Ko-Ko." Cleopatra's barge is evoked

by some Tizol-style exoticism in "Half the Fun," and in Billy Strayhorn's

"Star-crossed Lovers," Romeo and Juliet receive the benediction of a lush

Hodges ballad. Four other movements open up new territory. "Lady Mac"(beth) is

a down-home ragtime waltz with a tricky twenty-bar phrase structure that serves

as a vehicle for a suave Clark Terry solo. "The Telecasters," according to the

liner notes, represents the Three Witches (three trombones) and Iago (Harry

Carney). While the programmatic premise may be tongue-in-cheek, its opposition

of two dark colors demonstrates the principles of Ellingtonian counterpoint.

But this is a warm-up act in contrapuntal acrobatics to "Up and Down, Up and

Down," which compresses the entire story of A Midsummer Night's Dream into

three event-packed minutes. If ever there was an Ellington composition that

lived up to the phrase "beyond category," this is it. Then it goes even

further: with "Madness in Great Ones" the Danish Prince turns up in a

screech-trumpet mad scene that sounds like it could be the Art Ensemble of

Chicago or Anthony Braxton some fifteen years later.<p>



<p>



It seems almost too easy these days to say, with our saxophonist President,

that jazz is "America's classical music." Although the phrase has a nice ring

to it, it raises all sorts of questions (why classical? why American?) and then

hides them under the flag. Even the impeccable Whitney Balliett recently termed

Ives, Copland, and Barber "European apples" as opposed to that "American

orange" Ellington--you can see Charles Ives's mouth foaming with Yankee rage.

And I like to think that you can see Ellington himself shaking his head in

dismay at the latest tyranny of category.<p>



<p>



I've put Ellington head to head with Stravinsky not to set up a contest--would

it matter who won?--but to suggest that the music of these two great

twentieth-century composers can be talked about in the same terms and that when

viewed from certain perspectives, the two men might have more in common with

each other than with figures in their own traditions. As an assembler of music

and a creative plunderer of the past, Stravinsky is closer to Ellington than he

is to a more conventionally traditional and "sincere" composer like

Rachmaninoff. As a musical architect and an alchemist of tone color, Ellington

resembles Stravinsky more than he does an improvisational genius like John

Coltrane. Both composers treated tradition as a field they were free to

reshape--call it historical chutzpah. How's that for a category?<p>

But on arecent bike ride in the hills and valleys above Orvieto, in the region ofUmbria, I decided that there could be no finer place to own a stone farmhousethan among the green, green plains and hills that overlook the Tiber, farbelow, as it makes its way down to Rome. Rounding the switchbacks of a long,ecstatic descent from the small town of Castiglione back to Orvieto, passingright through the arch of a medieval watchtower at one turn, I kept identifyingperfect, foursquare houses in attractive states of disrepair. That's the one, Iwould say to myself. No, that one. I could hardly believe that perhaps the mostbeautiful landscape I had come upon in Italy was just beside the mainnorth-south highway--Italy's first superhighway, the A1--and less than twohours north of Rome.<p>I was predisposed to enjoy beauty, having begun the morning in the simplecomfort of La Badia, a hotel in a former abbey with much of its twelfth-centuryexterior and its nineteenth-century restoration intact, dramatically situated afew kilometers from the high bastions of Orvieto. Built on a plateau ofvolcanic rock, Orvieto is famous for its exceedingly ornate Gothic cathedral,with fa&ccedil;ade sculptures that helped to define Western images of hell, andmosaics as brightly colored as the Sony sign in Times Square. It should befamous for the ice cream at the Gelateria Pasqualetti, just behind the church,made by a master craftsman concerned with using the freshest fruit, which inthe fall includes figs, persimmons, and prickly pears, and with obtaining thecreamiest and deepest-flavored chocolate and pine-nut gelati. The path from theold town down to the modern one runs along medieval bastions and gray-blackwalls of volcanic stone so sheer that walking it you can feel, as I had thenight before, trapped on the ramparts of the castle of the Wicked Witch of theWest. (The crenellated twelve-sided tower of La Badia was my beacon; Iencountered no flying monkeys.) <p>The day was full of chance discoveries. I took my morning cappuccino in Porano,a pleasant village straight uphill from La Badia on the other side of Orvieto,where for a festival that Sunday there happened to be big pictures made ofcolored sawdust in the streets; around the main church the pavement pictureswere made of rose petals. Heading south, I followed rusty yellow signs toseveral Etruscan tombs, and to my happy surprise was able to rouse localcustodians who let me in. Traces of the Etruscans, enigmatic, artisticallyinnovative pre-Roman people who traded with the Greeks, are abundant north ofRome. Their subtly colored tomb paintings, by turns severe and gay, have mostlybeen taken to museums--for example, the newly installed National ArchaeologicalMuseum, behind the cathedral in Orvieto, which has a superb collection of<i>bucchero</i>, or<i> </i>lustrous black Etruscan pottery. The pottery'sbulbous and scalloped shapes, thin walls, and incised decoration seem moremodern and desirable than anything Greek or Roman. Even if the tomb's originalpaintings and objects have been removed or stolen, their rectilinear shapes andoften extensive layouts are there for the traveler on back roads who keeps aneye out.<p>What other part of the world offers so many unexpected pleasures--or so manyexpected ones, if you're always on the alert for exceptional food, as I am?Umbria is, after all, the source of some of Italy's best olive oil, every bitthe equal of Tuscany's in roundness and peppery bite, and of black truffles.The abundant truffles are less famous than Italy's white ones, but are said tobe the equal of France's Perigord black truffles, and are served with a moregenerous hand. The best Umbrian souvenirs, to my mind (genuine <i>bucchero</i>being hard to find and on the expensive side), are little bottles of choppedtruffles in oil, which you can get at Carraro, the best salumeria in Orvieto.Antonietta Carraro, the tart-tongued proprietress and chief cook, cheerfullyheckles customers in line when they get impatient for her room-temperaturerustic pizzas; savory little <i>panicelli</i>, rolls studded with localprosciutto and pecorino (sheep's-milk cheese); and <i>tisichelle</i>, marvelousbiscotti made with wine, olive oil, and anise seeds from a centuries-old recipethought to be restorative for its lack of eggs and butter.<p>For years <AHREF="http://www.mi.cnr.it:80/WOI/deagosti/regions/umbria.html#Umbria">Umbria</A>was an add-on to people's Tuscan itineraries, a place to break up the trip between Rome and Florence or Siena. But Umbria has its ownidentity: it is more rural than Tuscany, while sharing much of Tuscany'snobility and beauty. Even if today Umbria is siphoning tourists from Tuscany,who think they are discovering the very discovered Spoleto and Gubbio and Todi,large tracts of the region will be virtually empty whenever you visit. The besttime is autumn, when the black truffles are chopped into and over many dishes,and the air is cool but the hills are still green. <p>Umbria calls itself "the green heart of Italy," perhaps to turn its landlockedstatus into an asset, perhaps to emphasize the lack of industrialization, whichhas been a main reason for the ever-increasing sales of land and houses toforeigners who once would probably have bought in Tuscany. Certainly thestunning landscape is enough to make a visitor to Italy set aside at least afew days to see the region.<p>I keep returning to Umbria to try to understand its soul. It isn't easy. NancyHarmon Jenkins, an American writer on food who has long had a house on theborder with Tuscany, calls Umbria "veiled." The legacy of Saint Francis, whowas born in 1182 in Assisi, the region's principal tourist site, makes thesmall towns and hills where he preached both alluring and unknowable--like apainting by Piero della Francesca, who in the mid- 1400s worked in and aroundthe region. The Umbrian regard for nature helps explain the high numbers ofpolitical greens, both Italian and foreign, who have settled in the region; itspacific legacy is today more apparent than that of the soldiers who foughtbloody battles from Roman times onward. "Umbria spawned a superabundance ofsaints, warriors and artists--so many that almost any town can claim one ormore for its own," Curtis Bill Pepper, an American writer who has lived foryears near Todi, has written. "Nowhere in Italy is there such a compost ofprayer, violence and art."<p> Although more than two million <br>	tourists a year visit Assisi, the townretains its spirituality, which pervades the streets and buildings--many ofthem housing orders and other religious organizations, and almost all of thembuilt of the region's pinkish stone--without ever seeming either oppressive orexclusive. The Giotto frescoes of the life of Saint Francis, magnificentlyrestored in the Upper Church of the vast Basilica of Saint Francis (a decadebefore the cleaning of the Sistine Chapel, their startlingly bright colorscaused controversy), are the artistic core of Umbria.Surprisingly for a town that lives on day traffic, Assisi has severalrestaurants that serve local dishes at reasonable prices. Ravioli stuffed withwild greens and sheep's-milk ricotta were so good at Ristorante San Francesco,whose terrace overlooks the Upper Church, that I sneaked into the kitchen tosee where they came from. The hillsides around Assisi, the owners informed me;a <i>contadino</i>, or farm worker, had brought a basket of spiky raponzolithat morning. In keeping with Umbria's sobriquet, its greens seem at oncesweeter and more pungent than any in the surrounding regions. La Stalla, at theend of the town, shows the Umbrian mastery of the grill, serving rustic foodsuch as torta al formaggio (bread with melted local cheese) at modest prices.<p>My two favorite Umbrian towns, Bevagna and Montefalco, lie a short drive fromAssisi. Bevagna, on the plains, reflects Umbria's wealth in the twelfth andthirteenth centuries, when many of its great churches were built. (During theRenaissance, Umbria was papal property, and its riches went elsewhere.) Two bigand handsome Romanesque churches stand right across from each other in the mainsquare. In the basement of the town hall, which sits between them and datesfrom 1270, is a curious turn-of-the-century theater, visible through the newlyrestored arched windows. When I visited in late spring, the town was busilypreparing for some sort of festival--one clearly more for its own residentsthan for tourists, who were nevertheless welcome.<p>Every region seems to have a town that people claim is its "balcony" or"railing," and Montefalco is Umbria's: it sits on a high hill with views allaround. Montefalco has a marvelous museum, in a former Franciscan church madeinto a gallery in 1895 and recently brightened and reopened. The masterpiece ina noteworthy medieval and Renaissance collection is the fresco cycle of thelife of Saint Francis by Benozzo Gozzoli, painted about 150 years afterGiotto's and showing many of the same scenes. If Giotto expresses all of SaintFrancis's passion and renunciation of worldly pleasures, Gozzoli, a Florentinewho worked for the Medici in Florence, is true to Saint Francis's mercantileorigins: the colors and fabrics (Francis's father sold textiles) are sumptuous,the air cosmopolitan. Yet Gozzoli was surely moved, too, by his subject, andcomparing the two cycles makes a very pleasant day's labor.<p> A good base for excursions to all<br>	these towns is Le Tre Vaselle, a hoteland restaurant in Torgiano, a town put on the map by Giorgio Lungarotti, whosewines have in thirty years come to be among the most respected in Italy.Torgiano is a half hour by car from Perugia and most of the well-known hilltowns. The inn, in a seventeenth-century building, is comfortable and luxuriousbut not ostentatious; the smallish rooms are decorated with rustic furnitureand local textiles, examples of which are for sale at a handicrafts shop alsoowned by the Lungarottis. (Giorgio's two daughters have joined him in thebusiness.) The family has already opened, adjacent to the hotel, thebest-mounted, most informative wine museum in Italy, which is worth visitingeven if you don't stay at the inn. The inn's good food is naturally builtaround an all-Lungarotti wine list.<p>Perugia has in the nearly twenty years since I first saw it gone from being aprovincial capital enlivened by foreign students to being a sprawling citypractically engulfed by small industry. The students still come: they study atthe University for Foreigners, which was begun in 1921 to encourage foreignexchange. There's an important state university for Italians, too, and at nightthe main square, with its famous medieval fountain, is jammed with youth. Jazzlovers come for the long-established summer jazz festival, one of Europe's bestknown. The city merits at least half a day--a morning, to be sure of findingopen the National Gallery of Umbria, just restored and rehung, with itsmagnificent Piero della Francesca polyptych, also just restored. <p>Entering the city by car requires navigating a maze of mini-cloverleafs; youhave to park outside the walls and take escalators to the center. This entranceturns out to be delightful, because of the Piranesi-like spaces you travelthrough in the sixteenth-century walls of the Rocca Paolina. A papal fortressthat once dominated the city, the Rocca Paolina was mostly torn down byresentful citizens in the 1860s, at the time of Italy's unification; the wallshave become a kind of urban museum with piped-in music. You can have a thickhot chocolate and sacher or linzer torte at the Pasticceria Sandri, which haslong been owned by a Swiss family and has a Viennese Art Nouveau interiorthat's still intact. For decades Perugia meant Perugina chocolates to Italians,and in particular Baci ("Kisses")--chocolate-hazelnut balls ("decidedlynipple-like," Faith Heller Willinger calls them in <i>Eating in Italy</i>)wrapped in star-patterned foil with little romantic verses inside.<p>A Torgiano base also gives you access to Spoleto, which is best visited whenthe famous summer arts festival hasn't overtaken it, and to Gubbio, anothermedieval hill town. Tourists have taken note of Gubbio's excellent state ofpreservation, and they seem to be the only people there. I would rather drivealong the northern edge of Lake Trasimeno, just west of Perugia, to theolive-oil press of Alfredo Mancianti, who produces some of the most prized oilin Italy; in the same building is a charming shop where you'll often encounterhis proud father, Faliero, who bought the press in 1952. The trip will alsoshow you the lake, and it's hard to go wrong at any of the restaurants in theresort towns around it, which generally serve local fish such as perch andcarp. Another well-regarded oil producer is Maria Possenti-Castelli, nearTerni, who produces a powerfully truffle-flavored oil. Both sell their oils inelegant bottles worth carrying home.<p>The food of <A HREF="http://www1.iol.it/tci.sdp/html/e1800101.htm">Umbria</A>is simpler than that of any of the surrounding regions. There are only a few ingredients in a typical dish, such as the great spaghettialla Norcina, with its sauce of black truffles, garlic, and anchovies. The dishis named for Norcia, a town on the other side of Spoleto that is worth visitingfor the picture it gives of untouristed everyday life. What's more, in <i>Italyfor the Gourmet Traveler</i>, which will be published next March, Fred Plotkinsingles out Norcia as the best food town in Umbria. It's worth driving there,he says, to try the lentils--Italy's most famous--from the nearby town ofCastelluccio (which doesn't have Norcia's abundance of good places to eat), andthe various sausages and hams. "<i>Norcineria</i>" is a generic word thatbutchers all over Italy use for their line of pig products, and the butcher isa "<i>norcino</i>." Plotkin points out the restaurants Trattoria dal Franceseand Granaro del Monte.<p>The reason to go to Umbria--more than food, more than charming hill towns,more, perhaps, than frescoes--is that mystic landscape. The back road from Todito Orvieto, up hills and across valleys, past a medieval castle in the middleof the tiny town of Prodo, overlooking Lake Corbara far below, is another routelike the one that induced my bicycling ecstasy. The twenty-four-mile passage,which for the last third is dominated by the almost hallucinatory image ofOrvieto rising on its volcanic base, has inspired many of the foreigners whohave the means to indulge real-estate lust to find their ideal life there, atleast seasonally. The rest of us can drive up from Rome for a few days, andkeep dreaming. </blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

	<center><i><font size=4>At the very heart of winged flight lies the banked turn, a procedure that by

now seems so routine and familiar that airline passengers appreciate neither

its elegance and mystery nor its dangerously delusive character. The author, a

pilot, takes us up into the subject</i></font></center><p>

<font size=5>P</font>EOPLE who distrust the sensations of flight, who balk when an airplane banks

and turns, are on to something big. I was reminded of this recently while

riding in the back of a United Boeing 737 that was departing from San

Francisco. Directly over the Golden Gate we rolled suddenly into a steep turn,

dropping the left wing so far below the horizon that it appeared to pivot

around the bridge's nearest tower. For a moment we exceeded the airline maximum

of a thirty-degree bank, which is aerodynamically unimportant but is imposed

for passengers' peace of mind. Sightseeing seemed more important now. Our

pilots may have thought we would enjoy a dramatic view of the famous bridge and

the city beyond. But as the airplane turned, startled passengers looked away

from the windows. A collective gasp rippled through the cabin.<p>



	The reaction did not surprise me: as an instructor of beginning pilots, I've

heard gasps and worse from my students. Pilots are merely trained passengers.

They have to be told not to flinch, whimper, or make audible appeals to the

Savior. They have to be encouraged to ride the airplane willingly, as they

would a horse, to think as it thinks. And they have to be persuaded of the

strange logic of the turn. At its core lies the relationship between banking,

and the resulting flight path, and the fact, difficult at first to accept, that

neither can be felt.<p>



	Most people -- certainly the ones who were sitting next to me over San

Francisco -- would insist that they can indeed feel the bank. We have all had

the experience while reading or dozing on an airliner of feeling a lurch and

looking up to see, as expected, that the airplane is tilted. The lurch comes

when the airplane dips or raises a wing, starting into a turn or starting out

of one. Sometimes we can even give a direction to the bank. But if we then

close our eyes, we have no way of telling that we are sitting at an angle. I

know from experience how difficult it is to convince people of this. When the

bank is visible -- for instance, on a clear day -- the tilted horizon looks so

unusual that the view overpowers other perceptions. But during flight on black

nights, or in clouds, the bank is imperceptible, and passengers are heedless.

They may feel the odd lurch, but they have no way of guessing the airplane's

degree of bank. The inner ear, and with it the sense of balance, is neutralized

by the motion of flight. The airplane could be momentarily upside down and

passengers would not know.<p>



	Of course, none of this matters unless you are the pilot. But historically

pilots have made the same mistakes as passengers. Having been given the

airplane, they had to learn to use it. Generations were required. Eventually

they admitted that instinct was unreliable in clouds, and that they needed

special instruments to tell them what was happening to the plane. Without the

instruments they went into mysterious banks and dived out of control. Thus was

born the most basic distinction in flying, between conditions in which the turn

is visible and conditions in which it must be measured. The ability to fly

through weather and in darkness is more important than speed in the conquest of

distance. The mastery of the turn is the story of how aviation became practical

as a means of transportation. It is the story of how the world became small.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>S</font>OME definitions are in order. The bank is a condition of tilted wings, and the

turn is the change in direction that results. The connection between the two is

inexorable: the airplane must bank to turn, and when it is banked, it must

turn. The reason is simple. In flight with level wings the lifting force of the

wings is directed straight up, and the airplane does not turn; in a bank the

lifting force is tilted to the side, and the airplane therefore must move to

that side. It cannot slide sideways through the air, because it has a vertical

fin on the tail, which forces the turn by keeping the tail in line behind the

nose. The result is an elegantly curved flight path, created as the airplane

lifts itself through the changes in direction.<p>



	The turn, however, comes at a price. As the bank steepens, the airplane has

greater difficulty holding its altitude.  Flown at bank angles approaching

ninety degrees -- in which the wings point straight up and down -- a normal airplane cannot keep

from descending. In such "knife-edge" flight the force that once lifted the

wings in a direction perpendicular to the earth's surface is now directed

parallel to it, and gravity pulls the airplane down. However, if the pilot

controls the airplane carefully and allows it to keep turning, it will happily

roll past the vertical, onto its back, and finally right side up again. During

such a maneuver San Francisco Bay would momentarily appear above you, and the

Golden Gate Bridge would seem to hang from the water. This is fine if you are

prepared for it. Full rolls are the purest expression of flight. They are

normally flown only in fighters and other acrobatic airplanes, but if you

ignore convention, you can fly them in any airplane, including a Boeing 737.<p>



	None of this would have comforted the man sitting next to me during that steep

turn over the Golden Gate. He was large, sharp-eyed, and alert. When the wing

dropped, he said, "Hey!" and grabbed the armrests. Now he rode "above" me in

the bank, leaning into the aisle as if he feared toppling into my lap. He need

not have worried. If he had dropped his pen, it would have fallen not "down" in

the conventional sense -- toward me and the earth -- but rather toward the tilted

carpet at his feet. If he had dangled the pen from a string, it would have hung

at a ninety-degree angle with respect to the tilted floor.<p>



	A dangled pen is a primitive inclinometer, like a plumb bob or the heel

indicator on a sailboat. On land or at sea it will hang toward the center of

the planet. But in flight it will hang toward the floor, no matter how steeply

the airplane is banked. A carpenter's level would be equally fooled. This

peculiar phenomenon is a manifestation of the turn's inherent balance. The

earth's gravity acts on an airplane, and of course on objects in an airplane,

but so do the forces of inertia, the desire of any mass to keep doing what it

has been doing. The neatness of this Newtonian package is beautiful to behold.

Bob Hoover, a stunt pilot, mounted a video camera in his cockpit, set an empty

glass on the instrument panel, and poured himself a soft drink while flying

full rolls. Our United pilots seemed inclined to fly the same way. If they had

done so, as we passed inverted above the Golden Gate Bridge and saw it hanging

from the water, my sharp-eyed neighbor could have watched his pen dangling

toward the sky. During the roll the flight attendants could have walked upside

down. And some passengers, too busy to look outside, wouldn't even have

noticed.<p>



	The human body is another inclinometer. Undisturbed by the view, it sits

quietly, dangling toward the tilted floor, churning out memos for the home

office. The man next to me was not about to fall into my lap. He could have

relaxed, lowered the tray in front of him, and called for a coffee. Unlike a

table on a sailboat, an airplane tray requires no gimbals. Flight attendants do

not develop sea legs. They brew coffee on a fixed counter, deliver it without

worrying about the bank angle, and fill cups to their brims. Full cups make

people behave during turns: if they try to hold them level with the earth, the

coffee pours out and scalds their thighs. If this is hard to believe, imagine

the alternative -- an airplane in which "down" was always toward the ground.

Bedlam would break loose in the cabin during turns.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>A</font>S long as its wings are level, an airplane is well mannered and slow to anger.

If you pull its nose up and then release the controls, it puts its nose back

down; if you push it down, it answers by rearing up. Like horseback riding,

flying consists mostly of leaving the beast alone. The problem is that this

particular beast does not stay on the trail unguided, and once it strays, it

develops a strong impulse to self-destruct.<p>



	Unguided, any airplane will eventually begin to bank. That by itself would be

fine if you didn't mind the resulting turn. But as the bank tilts the lift

force of the wings, reducing their vertical effectiveness, it erodes the

equilibrium that previously countered the pull of the earth. The airplane

responds to the loss by lowering its nose and accelerating. Sitting in the

cockpit with folded arms and watching it proceed is like letting a

temperamental horse gallop down a steepening slope: it requires steady nerves

and a morbid curiosity. In flight the slope steepens because the acceleration

tightens the airplane's turn, which increases its bank angle, which causes

further acceleration. Sooner or later a sort of aerodynamic lock-in occurs. The

airplane banks to vertical or beyond, and points its nose straight down.<p>



	That's the spiral dive. In its most lethal forms it is called the graveyard

spiral. The airplane flies in ever-steeper circles and either disintegrates

from excessive speed or hits the ground in a screaming descent. Most flights

would suffer this end if the pilot (or auto pilot) did not intervene. In good

weather the intervention is easy. When you see that the airplane has banked,

you unbank it. During turns you hold the controls more firmly, and keep the

nose from dropping.<p>



	The increased loading caused by inertia during a well flown turn is felt

within the cabin as a peculiar heaviness. Pilots measure it in "Gs," as a

multiple of gravity's normal pull. An airplane that banks to thirty degrees

creates a loading of 1.15 Gs: the airplane, and everything in it, temporarily

weighs 15 percent more than normal. Fifteen percent is hardly noticeable. But

when the bank grows only a bit steeper, to forty-five degrees, the load

increases to 1.4 Gs: people feel pressed into their seats, and they might

notice that the wings have flexed upward. Technically it is not important.

Airplanes are strong. Pilots shrug off two Gs, and may feel comfortable at

twice as much. But passengers are unaccustomed to the sensation. As we pivoted

over the Golden Gate, I estimated that my neighbor had gained about eighty

pounds. Had he dangled his pen toward the tilted floor, it would have pulled on

the string with surprising force. This might not have reassured him. But the

extra heaviness is a measure of the pilot's success in resisting the spiral

dive. If we had felt "normal" during the turn, it could only have meant that

the nose was dropping fast toward the water.<p>



	No pilot would make such a mistake on a clear day. The view from the cockpit

is dominated by the horizon, the constantly renewing division between the sky

and the earth. It forms a line across the windshield, and makes immediate sense

of the airplane's movements. In clouds or on black nights, when they cannot see

outside, pilots keep their wings level by watching an artificial horizon on the

instrument panel. The artificial horizon is a gyroscopically steadied line,

which stays level with the earth's surface. The airplane pitches and banks in

relation to this steady line, which in spatial terms never moves. Of course, in

<i>airplane</i> terms it does move -- which presents a problem, because pilots are part

of the airplane: they fly it from within, strapped to their seats. In clear

skies they would never misjudge a bank as the tilting of the earth, but with

their view restricted to the abstractions of the instrument panel they

sometimes do just that: when the airplane banks, they perceive the motion as a

movement of the artificial horizon line across the face of the instrument. This

causes them to "fly" the wrong thing -- the moving horizon line, rather than

the fixed symbolic airplane. For example, as turbulence tilts the airplane to

the left, the pilots, tilting with it, notice the artificial horizon line

dropping to the right. Reacting instinctively to the indication of motion, they

sometimes try to raise the line as if it were a wing. The result of such a

reversal in such cases is murderous. Pilots steer to the left just when they

should steer to the right, and then in confusion they steer harder. While

cruising calmly inside clouds, I have had student pilots suddenly try to flip

the airplane upside down. These were perfectly rational people, confronted by

the turn.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>A</font>IRPLANES did not shrink the world overnight. The Wrights flew straight and

level at Kitty Hawk in December of 1903, and nobody paid much attention. They

went home to Dayton, rented a cow pasture, and spent the following year

stretching their flights and learning to turn. The first detailed account of

their flights appeared in <i>Gleanings in Bee Culture</i>, a journal for beekeepers

published in nearby Medina. The editor, A. I. Root, traveled to the pasture and

on September 20, 1904, saw Wilbur fly the first full circle. Bees, of course,

are the great specialists in full-circle flying; they spend their days on

round-trip missions, and construct whole worlds out of their ability to turn. I

do not know if Root was influenced by these thoughts, but he understood the

significance of the Wrights' achievement. The U.S. Army was slower to catch on.

Five years later, after much persuading by the Wrights, it reluctantly took

delivery of its first airplane. In 1909 horses still seemed more glorious.<p>



The war in Europe changed that. Unsullied by the carnage in the trenches,

pilots chased across the sky, turning hard on each other's tails. The war

taught them to fly with confidence, and encouraged the myth of instinct. Those

who survived made the dangerous discovery that they could feel at home in the

sky. They learned to accept the strangeness of a steep ban -- the G load and the

tilted horizon -- and the magic of a full roll. Nonetheless, they still believed

in instinctive balance: when they ducked through small clouds and emerged with

their wings slightly tilted, they did not appreciate the significance of this

small clue -- did not suspect the importance of the unfelt bank. Although

scientific thinkers on both sides of the Atlantic had, by the end of the war,

come to understand the intricacies of the banked turn, pilots, trapped by

vanity, paid little heed. And because pilots at the time rarely flew in bad

weather or on black nights, they did not expose themselves to the conditions

that would have fostered deeper insight.<p>



At the end of the war regular airmail service started in Europe and the United

States. It made airplanes useful to the public for the first time, gave birth

to the airlines, and placed pressure on the pilots to operate on schedules.

They followed rivers and railroads in open-cockpit biplanes, flying under the

weather, sometimes at extremely low altitude, dodging steeples and oil

derricks. Many pilots were killed.<p>



	In December of 1925 a young Army pilot named Carl Crane got caught in the

clouds at 8,000 feet directly over Detroit while trying to fly a congressman's

son to Washington, D.C., in a biplane. Crane later became a famous master of

the turn. Recalling this particular flight, he said, "In a short time I was

losing altitude, completely out of control. I could not fly the airplane at

all -- it had gotten into a spiral dive. Halfway down I looked around at my boy

in the back, and he was enjoying the flight no end. He was shaking his hands

and grinning, and I was slowly dying because I knew we were going to crash."<p>



	The boy in the rear cockpit was just unaware. Crane had an altimeter and an

airspeed indicator. He thought he was dying "slowly" only because of the way

experience is compressed when an airplane goes wild. People's minds can work

extraordinarily fast. Pilots tend to think not about God or their lives but

about solutions. Crane searched his training and remembered only vague

admonitions to stay out of bad weather. Of course, he was in it now, and

couldn't see a thing. He knew he was turning but could make no sense of the

compass. It is a notorious problem: because the earth's magnetic field does not

lie parallel to the globe's surface but dips down toward the magnetic poles,

the compass responds to banks by spinning erratically, jamming, and sometimes

showing turns in reverse. Crane did not know which wing was down, let alone by

how much. If he tried to level the wings, he was just as likely to roll upside

down as right side up. If he tried to raise the nose, the effect would be

exactly the opposite: the turn would quicken, steepening the descent. For a

pilot these are the central issues of the spiral dive. Crane understood none of

it at the time, but he sensed that his situation was hopeless.<p>



	In modern times air-traffic control recorded the radio transmissions of an

unskilled pilot who, with his family on board, tried to descend through

overcast. After he lost control, he began to sob into the microphone, begging

the radar controllers to tell him which side was up. But radar shows air

traffic as wingless blips on a map, and is incapable of distinguishing banks.

Controllers are in the business of keeping airplanes from colliding. Pilots are

in the business of flight control. This one had instruments on board by which

he could have kept his wings level, but in the milkiness of the clouds he

became confused. The controllers listened helplessly to his panic and, in the

background, to the screams of his children. The transmissions ended when the

airplane broke apart.<p>



	Crane's biplane was stronger. "Finally it got down to under a thousand feet,

and I said, 'Well, here we go. I'm going to look at my boy once more.' And as I

turned around to look at him, a sign went by my wing. It said 'Statler Hotel.'

I had just missed the top of the Statler Hotel. In all the mist and rain, I

could see the buildings and the streets. I flew down the street and got over

the Detroit River, and flew about ten feet high all the way to Toledo, shaking

all the way."<p>



	Shocked by the way intuition had abandoned him, Crane began to ask questions.

For years he got no intelligent answers. Veterans of the military and the

airmail service still insisted they could fly "by the seat of the pants," and

they thought less of those who could not. Their self-deception now seems all

the more profound because the solution to the problem of flying in clouds and

darkness -- a gyroscope adapted to flying -- was already widely available.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE gyroscope is a spinning wheel, like a child's top, mounted in gimbals that

allow it freedom of movement. It has two important traits: left alone, it

maintains a fixed orientation in space (in relation to the stars); and when

tilted, it reacts in an odd but predictable way. Elmer Sperry, the great

American inventor, started playing with these traits in the early 1900s. As a

curiosity, he designed a gyrostabilized "trained wheelbarrow," and he tried,

without success, to interest a circus in it. Undiscouraged, Sperry turned to

the U.S. Navy instead, and interested it in gyro-compasses and ship

stabilizers. Competitors in Europe developed similar devices, and during the

buildup to war interested their countries' navies, too.<p>



	Airplanes were an intriguing sideline. Sperry built a gyroscopic auto pilot in

1910, not to enable blind flight but to stabilize the otherwise unruly early

flying machines. In 1915 he began to ponder instrumentation, and with prescient

insight into the problems of flight was able after three years to produce the

first gyroscopic turn indicator, an instrument still in use today. Its face

consisted of a vertical pointer, which indicated turns to the left or right.

(Necessarily, it also included a ball like the one in a carpenter's level, an

inclinometer that showed not bank but "skid" or "slip" --  conditions of

imbalance.) Sperry called the instrument a "crutch for the compass." In his

patent application he described it as an instrument that would allow pilots to

fly indefinitely through clouds, implying that without it they could not.<p>



	One of the earliest cloud flights with a turn indicator was made by William

Ocker, an Army pilot, in 1918. Though he, too, spiraled out of overcast, he

concluded correctly that his mistake had been to favor sensation over the

instrument's indications. During the 1920s a few Post Office pilots began to

fly by instruments. When Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic, in 1927, a

turn indicator kept him from spiraling into the sea when he met fog. Two years

later Jimmy Doolittle made a "blind" landing, after flying a complete circuit

around an airport in a special biplane modified with a domed cockpit from which

he could not see outside. The landing itself was a technical dead end. Once

Doolittle was over the field, he reduced the power and waited until the biplane

plunked into the grass -- a technique that would not be practical for the

airlines. More significant were the special devices that made the precisely

flown circuit possible. The airplane was equipped with navigational radios, an

airspeed indicator, an improved altimeter, a turn indicator, and two new

gyroscopic instruments from Elmer Sperry -- a gyroscopic compass and an

artificial horizon. This combination was so effective that it still forms the

core of instrument panels today. Doolittle compared the artificial horizon to

cutting a porthole through the fog to look at the real horizon. Devising

technology was the easy part. The more stubborn problem of belief remained. As

late as 1930 one of the airlines wrote to Sperry complaining about a mysterious

problem: the instruments worked fine in clear air, but as soon as they were

taken into clouds, they began to indicate turns.<p>



	Still worried about his near collision with the Statler Hotel, Carl Crane read

with fascination the descriptions of Doolittle's flight. He was now, in 1929,

an Army instructor at a training base in Texas. Though his superior officers

disapproved of instrument flying, Crane was convinced of the need for

gyroscopes.  He finally got permission to cover over a cockpit and turn one of

the biplanes into an instrument trainer. While he was at work on this, William

Ocker wandered into the hangar. Ocker didn't look like much of a pilot, with

his bifocals and his mournful, puritan face, but	he had a powerful mind and the

restless soul of a missionary. The truth about instrument flying had come to him in 1926, during a routine medical examination

in San Francisco.  To demonstrate that the senses could be fooled, a doctor

had asked Ocker to close his eyes while being spun in a chair.  Ocker felt the

chair begin to turn, and guessed the direction correctly -- but when the chair

slowed, he felt it had stopped, and when the chair stopped, he felt it was now

turning in the opposite direction. For the doctor, it was a trick on the inner

ear, an amusing exercise in vertigo. For Ocker, it was a stunning revelation:

the sense of accelerating into a turn is the same as that of decelerating from

the opposite turn. The chair induced the same false sensations that led pilots

to mistrust their turn indicators. Even those who accepted their inability to

feel the bank were losing control. Ocker now knew why. He had found here in the

spinning chair the proof that instinct is <i>worse</i> than useless in the clouds.<p>



Ocker became so obsessed with the spinning chair that he was hospitalized twice

for sanity tests and later banished by the Army to Texas. His preaching had

become tiresome. Nonetheless, he had discovered the most disturbing limitation

of human flight -- the feelings that cause people to sway dizzily from

wings-level flight into spiral dives. Having gyroscopes is not enough. Pilots

must learn to believe them, even though their bodies may have invented phantom

turns. And fiction can be compelling. I have seen students break into a sweat

in the effort not to submit.<p>



	Ocker and Crane began a systematic exploration of flying inside clouds. In

1932 they published <i>Blind Flight in Theory and Practice</i>, the first clear

analysis of instrument flying. The book had an enormous influence. The authors

tried to lay to rest the old faith in flying by instinct. They described the

physics of the turn and the confusion experienced by the inner ear, but their

most dramatic argument grew out of an experiment with pigeons. From everything

pilots had learned, it seemed evident that birds, too, must be unable to fly without a visible horizon. Ocker and

Crane blind folded pigeons, took them up in biplanes, and threw them out. Sure enough, the

birds dropped into fluttering emergency descents -- they panicked and went down

like feathered parachutes. It is possible, of course, that they did not like

the blindfolds, which were made of Bull Durham tobacco pouches. But anyway, the

experiment was the kind pilots understood. If God had meant birds to fly in the

clouds, He would have given them gyroscopes.<p>

<p>



<font size=5>B</font>IRDS are not the perfect flyers that you might expect. They cannot fly through

heavy rain. They get sucked up by thunderstorms, frozen by altitude, and burned

by lightning. They crash into obstacles, wander offshore, run out of fuel, and

die by the millions. They would rather not migrate in bad weather, and usually

don't. Nonetheless, it now appears that Ocker and Crane may have been wrong:

there is evidence that some birds do occasionally fly inside clouds. This is

big news. Word of it appeared in 1972, in the proceedings of a NASA symposium

on animal navigation. Hidden among reports like "When the Beachhopper Looks at

the Moon" and "Anemomenotactic Orientation in Beetles and Scorpions" (that

is, "When a Bug Feels the Wind") was a paper titled "Nocturnal Bird Migration

in Opaque Clouds." It was written by Donald Griffin, the Harvard zoologist who

discovered the use of sonar by bats. Griffin reported that he had bought a

military surplus radar and on overcast nights in New York had tracked birds

that seemed to be flying inside clouds. There were only a few, and Griffin was

able to track them only for a couple of miles, but they appeared to be flying

straight. Griffin's biggest problem was uncertainty over the flight conditions

at the birds' altitude. Were the clouds really as thick as they looked from

below? Were the birds really flying blind? Griffin had good reason to believe

so, but as a scientist he had to be cautious. His final report, in 1973,

reinforced the earlier findings but was more cautiously titled "Oriented Bird

Migration in or Between Opaque Cloud Layers." Ornithologists still cite it from

memory. To those interested in bird navigation, the difference between "in" and

"between" is just a detail; the point is, the birds seemed to know their way

without reference to the stars or to the ground. But to birds, whose first job

is keeping their wings level and controlling their turns, the distinction might

be crucial. Griffin, a former pilot, understands its importance. I recently

mentioned to him my impression that some ornithologists seem stuck on the

ground, and he laughed. "I keep telling them, 'Gee, birds fly!'"<p>



	Assuming they fly in the clouds, the question is how? Ornithologists have no

answer, and they shy away from speculation. It is known that birds navigate by

watching the ground and the positions of the sun, the moon, and the stars --

none of which would help them in clouds. But they may also use a host of

nonvisual clues, and may use mental "maps" based on sound, smell, air currents,

variations in gravitational pull, and other factors. Experiments have shown

that some species are extremely sensitive to magnetic forces. In their heads

they have magnetite crystals surrounded by nerves, which may give them

intuitive knowledge of their direction (and location) in the earth's magnetic

field.<p>



	Another possibility is that birds have internal gyroscopes of a primitive

sort. This is less farfetched than it seems: the rhythmic flapping of wings

could have the effect of Foucault's pendulum, allowing a bird to sense turns

without any external cue. A pendulum is more than a hanging weight -- it is a

hanging weight that has been pushed and is swinging freely. Swinging gives a

pendulum its special ability to maintain spatial orientation. Leon Foucault was

the French physicist who first used one, in 1851, to demonstrate the rotation

of the earth: though the pendulum appeared to change direction as it swung, in

fact the plane of its swing remained constant, and the apparent change was

caused by the turning of the earth underneath it. If birds rely on the pendulum

effect, they are not alone. Flies and mosquitoes (along with more than 85,000

other species of Diptera) use specially adapted vibrating rods to maintain

spatial orientation in flight. Not only can they turn sharply, roll upside

down, and land on the underside of leaves, but they can do it in fog.<p>



	Pilots, too, have relied on pendulums. It is said that an airliner inbound to

New York in the 1950s lost all its gyroscopes in heavy weather over Block

Island. The captain was a wise old man who had risen with the airlines from the

earliest airmail days and was approaching retirement. A lesser pilot might have

fallen for the trap of intuition. But the captain simply took out his pocket

watch, dangled it from its chain, and began to swing it toward the instrument

panel. Flying by the pendulum and the compass, he proceeded the length of Long

Island in the clouds. After breaking into the clear near the airport, he landed

and wished his passengers a good day.<p>



	The story is not impossible. I had it in mind one night when I flew out over

the Pacific Ocean in a small airplane. High clouds darkened the sky. The light

of a fishing boat drifted close by the coast. Flying a mile above the water, I

headed beyond it, into complete blackness.<p>



	Nowhere can a person find greater solitude than alone in flight. At night in

clouds and over water, the cockpit becomes a world of its own, and the

instrument panel another world within it. The instruments glow in a warm light,

telling the strange story of the airplane's motion. Enjoying this isolation, I

flew on until, behind me, the fishing boat was a distant glimmer. The

gyroscopes functioned perfectly. The radios were blissfully silent. I hooked a

metal pen to a fishing line and dangled it from a knob on the ceiling. Flying

by the artificial horizon, I made a steep turn and watched the pen dangle

toward the tilted floor. Then I straightened out, pushed the pen toward the

instrument panel, and released it. It swung for almost a minute before

requiring another push. Each renewal would, of course, erase the pendulum's

spatial memory. Nonetheless, I thought the device might work. After turning

parallel to the coast, I covered the gyroscopes with slips of paper.<p>



	The night air was smooth. The pen swung rhythmically toward the panel and

back. When eventually the airplane banked and therefore turned, the swinging

pen, though it continued to swing through a point perpendicular to the floor,

maintained a memory of the airplane's original heading, and seemed to have

redirected itself to the left. This could only mean that the airplane had

banked to the right. I steered left gingerly, hoping to raise the right wing

just enough to return to straight flight. The pen seemed to stabilize in its

new direction. I renewed the swing, shoving the pen again directly toward the

panel. It soon confirmed that the airplane had indeed leveled its wings. After

the compass settled, it showed that I had turned twenty degrees to the right.

Lowering the left wing cautiously, watching the pen swing to the right, I crept

back to my original heading. Later, when I tried to make a large turn, I

spiraled and had to peek at the gyroscopes. But with the wings level again I

flew on for miles, learning to work with the swinging pen. Trust comes slowly

in the indication of turns. It is a peculiar faith that makes the world so

small.<p>

	<font size=5>S</font>OMETIME in 1954, when he was twenty-four years old, the trumpeter Clifford

Brown became one of the greatest jazz soloists. His playing, already celebrated

for its fluency and imagination took on a rhythmic grace, an added ease at

whatever tempo he was confronted with, and a variety that made his phrases

billow and float as naturally as silk in a gentle wind. A brilliant melodist

with a big, singing tone, Brown was playing with warmth, forthrightness, and a

headlong swing reminiscent of the young Louis Armstrong. Two years later he was

dead, a victim of a car crash that also killed the pianist Richie Powell and

Powell's wife.<p>



<p>



Brown's death affected musicians all over the country. The saxophonist Benny

Golson, for example, wrote "I Remember Clifford" in tribute. The tragedy

devastated Max Roach, the leader with Brown of the Clifford Brown-Max Roach

Quintet, which had begun in 1954. Only recently has Roach been able to play

music associated with Brown, whom he has called "a sweet, beautiful

individual." Brown made an impact with his personality as well as with his

horn. At a time when jazz musicians were popularly associated with big egos,

drugs, and alcohol, he was a clean-living, soft-spoken family man. The recent

issue of his complete Blue Note recordings includes a picture of him holding

his infant son; his widow, whose notes provide one of the real charms of the

collection, remembers him explaining jazz to the infant. Sonny Rollins called

Brown "perfect all around." and the drummer Alan Dawson, who roomed with Brown

when they were both in the Lionel Hampton big band, recently described him as a

"down-home guy, a quiet, country, slow-talking kind of guy." Few musicians have

inspired the love that Brown seemed to attract. Thanks to a number of recent

reissues, we can follow virtually all of Brown's short career.<p>



<p>



His rise was swift. At his death he had played trumpet for only ten years. When

he was fifteen, in 1945, his father gave him his first trumpet, but in 1950 he

had an accident that kept him from his music for a year. By then he had already

been working around Philadelphia. Back on the job in 1951. Brown was praised by

Charlie Parker and hired by Chris Powell, the leader of a rhythm-and-blues band

called Chris Powell and His Blue Flames.<p>



<p>



The composer T. J. Anderson, who first saw Brown with the Blue Flames, recently

said, "Clifford had this articulate type of playing where you separate each

note clearly. Also he could play in between the beats real well. And he

communicated."<p>



<p>



In 1952 Brown made his first records, as a sideman with the Blue Flames. He

took a warm, Dizzy Gillespie-ish solo on the novelty calypso "I Come From

Jamaica" and a relatively sophisticated chorus on "Ida Red." (Both are

available on <I>The Beginning and the End</I>. Columbia, KC 32284.) In June of 1953 he

recorded with Lou Donaldson and then J. J. Johnson, and in August he was making

his first recordings as a leader. "Brownie Speaks," from the Donaldson session,

shows his fat tone and his cleanly articulated lines with their brilliant runs.

Only when we compare these solos with later ones can we find flaws in them. At

times he would seem almost driven at fast tempos; he might string together

pairs of eighth notes in the first chorus, accenting the first note of each

pair and varying the pell-mell action only with an occasional triplet. A year

later he sounded effortless and expansive on even the fastest numbers.<p>



<p>



Perhaps he hadn't yet found his perfect drummer. From the late summer of 1953

to the spring of 1954 Brown was a fan of the rough, bashing style of Art

Blakey, with whom he had made several recordings. Later in 1954 he and Roach

began the collaboration that made Brown famous. What Roach offered Brown was

firm support and a clear, ringing sound in a relatively un-busy style. Roach is

a melodic drummer. Where Blakey pounded and prodded, Roach let Brown's own

melodies unravel. (We can hear Blakey pressing Brown on the Blue Note

recordings made live at Birdland in February of 1954. The Blakey, Donaldson, J.

J. Johnson, and early Clifford Brown sessions, including several previously

unreleased takes, have been issued on <I>The Complete Blue Note and Pacific Jazz

Recordings of Clifford Brown</I> by Mosaic Records, 197 Strawberry Hill Avenue,

Stamford, Conn. 06092. This five-disc set is available only through the mail,

for $42.50 plus $3.00 for postage.) Blakey is the quintessential hard-bop

drummer, and Roach is a cooler technician. Brown, given his own virtuosity,

didn't need to be pushed. He had something in common with the cooler "West

Coast" sound: a love of uncluttered melody. Just before the first session, in

August of 1954, of the Clifford Brown-Max Roach Quintet, he recorded such tunes

as "Blueberry Hill" and "Gone With the Wind" and his own "Joy Spring" and

"Daahoud" with a group of West Coast musicians. On "Blueberry Hill," then an

easygoing hit for the blithely rocking Fats Domino, and on "Joy Spring," a

gentle, bouncing number, Brown seems to be discovering the value of

disengagement, of one step taken backward. He sounds as poised as a boxer

dancing confidently on the balls of his feet.<p>



<p>



It is that poise and the incomparable appeal of his improvised melodies that

make Brown's playing with Roach so bewitching. In the less than two years they

had as a team, Brown and Roach went into the studios together fifteen times,

once to make <I>Clifford Brown With Strings</I> (EmArcy EXPR1011), a favorite album of

virtually every modern trumpeter, twice in jam sessions, and the rest of the

times with the quintet. Brown also accompanied the singers Sarah Vaughan and

Helen Merrill. All these recordings are being made available in new pressings

by Polygram, among them two albums of material that was either never before

released or released only in edited form (<I>More Study in Brown</I>, EmArcy 195JI and

<I>Jams2</I>, EmArcy 195J2). They are also being issued as compact discs that largely

eliminate the distortion of Max Roach's cymbals heard on some of the original

recordings.<p>



<p>



The quintet remade tunes that Brown had recorded earlier (such as "Daahoud" and

"Cherokee"), and without exception Brown sounds better, more richly inventive,

on the later versions. If he sputtered a little on the "Cherokee" recorded with

Blakey in 1953, his 1955 version is played with warmhearted panache. He begins

his solo on the walking blues "Sandu" with a laid-back phrase so captivating

that it makes what comes afterward almost unnecessary. He developed an uncanny

ability to invent short, unexpected phrases that tell whole stories. At the

beginning of his second chorus of "Pent-Up House" (on the Sonny Rollins album

<I>Three Giants!</I>, Prestige 7821), he plays an almost childlike six-note melody,

varies it in a repetition, and then gradually walks away from it. But the

melody stays with you.<p>



<p>



On the night before he was killed, Brown was playing with a pickup group in a

session that was recorded informally. Three of the numbers were issued by

Columbia, on <I>The Beginning and the End</I>. They find Brown in an exuberant mood,

playing Charlie Parker's "Donna Lee" at an impossibly fast tempo, and sounding

bumptious on the Miles Davis hit "Walkin.'" When he plays "Night in Tunisia,"

he seems to be inviting comparison to the two giants of the modern jazz

trumpet, Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie. Thoroughly original, he was at the

time their only competition. "Night in Tunisia" leaves a space for a solo break

that boppers from Gillespie on have used to show their agility. Brown modestly

avoids the typical bravura display with a slow, relaxed descending phrase, and

then proceeds with a genial, consequential solo that becomes more exciting with

every note. The fire seems to come from deep within him--and that's the way it

should be in jazz.<p>

	<font size=5>J</font>azz is enduring what appears to be a mid-life crisis. As in people, the

telltale symptom is a drooling infatuation with youth. It all began with the

success of Wynton Marsalis, who was just twenty when he released his first

album, in 1982. Overlooking the fact that musicians as talented as Marsalis are

rare at any age, the major record labels have been signing untested young

instrumentalists in the hope that lightning will strike twice. Not

surprisingly, given the promotional effort of which these labels are capable,

those young musicians are virtually the only jazz performers now receiving any

notice. They are being treated as such a novelty that it's becoming difficult

to remember that jazz was once assumed to <I>require</I> the vigor of youth.<p>



<p>



For a reminder of the way things used to be, I recently reread an essay called

"Why Do They Age So Badly?," by the late French critic and composer Andre

Hodeir. (Written sometime in the 1950s, it was included in Hodeir's 1962

collection <I>Toward Jazz</I>, translated by Noel Burch.) Lamenting that what lay

ahead for any jazz musician who reached middle age having achieved some degree

of recognition was "an unremitting decline, an inevitable subsidence into

complacency," Hodeir argued that "jazz has one thing in common with sports: it

requires its performers . . . to be in first-rate physical condition." But

whereas "the aging athlete is <I>obliged</I> to retire" (Hodeir's italics), jazz

audiences permit older musicians to go on suiting up, as it were, until they

drop. Hodeir cited as an example of fans reluctant to "repudiate their

traditional idols" a Parisian audience that responded worshipfully to the

trumpeter Roy Eldridge in 1950, "when he was already well on the decline."<p>



<p>



In 1950 Eldridge was all of thirty-nine, with at least twenty-five more years

of crackling solos ahead of him. What has aged badly is Hodeir's arguments,

although in fairness it should be acknowledged that he was one of the first to

write about jazz with such candor and that his essay dates from a period when

bebop--then considered the ultimate in modernity--must have made the mature

accomplishments of swing-era veterans like Eldridge seem a little passe.

Reading "Why Do They Age So Badly?" in 1991, I find myself wondering what

Hodeir would make of the alto saxophonist Benny Carter, who turned eighty-four

last month, and whose powers as an improviser remain miraculously unimpaired.<p>



<p>



The perseverance of elderly musicians is an open invitation to sentimentality,

and Carter long ago reached the age at which an instrumentalist elicits

admiration merely for playing, no matter how shakily. But I really do believe

that Carter, who aside from Lionel Hampton is the last surviving major figure

of the 1930s, is still making vibrant contributions to jazz six decades later.

In so doing, he offers present-day audiences a singular thrill--the chance to

look back on history as it continues to unfold.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<p>



<font size=5>C</font>ARTER has been around practically forever. Although the standard discographies

show him to have made his recording debut with Charlie Johnson's Paradise

Orchestra, in 1928, Carter himself remembers participating in a session with

the blues singer Clara Smith four years earlier. His first recorded arrangement

(of "P.D.Q. Blues," for Fletcher Henderson) was written in 1927, the same year

he published his first composition ("Nobody Knows," co-written with Fats

Waller). After working as a sideman with Henderson and Chick Webb, and serving

as music director of McKinney's Cotton Pickers and leader of the Wilburforce

Collegians, Carter formed the first of his own big bands in 1932.<p>



<p>



These are dates that I have selected almost at random from the detailed 

chronology included in Morroe Berger, Edward Berget, and James Patrick's 

exhaustive two-volume <I>Benny Carter: A Life in American Music</I> (1982).  

Another piece of information might give a better sense of just how long 

Carter has been active in music.  The album usually cited as his best is 

<I>Further Definitions</I> (MCA Impulse MCA5651), from 1961.  It reunited him with 

his fellow saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, whose path had regularly crossed 

his over the decades, most notably with Henderson in the twenties and on 

the four titles they recorded together with the guitarist Django Reinhardt, 

in Paris in 1937.  Two numbers were reprised from that 1937 session, with 

Phil Woods and Charlie Rouse taking the places of the French saxophonists 

Andre Ekyan and Alix Combelle.  For the album Carter, whose trademark as an 

arranger is his rich saxophone voicings, also orchestrated Hawkins's 

emblematic 1939 solo on "Body and Soul" for four horns, and paid homage to 

Duke Ellington and Ben Webster by including the famous sax-section chorus 

from their 1940 recording of "Cotton Tail." <I>Further Definitions</I> was hailed 

as a latter-day triumph for Carter upon its release, almost thirty years 

ago.<p>



<p>



Carter has long inspired something approaching awe in his fellow musicians. He

surpassed even Johnny Hodges as the primary influence on the alto saxophone

before the arrival of Charlie Parker, in the 1940s. But he also plays credible

trumpet (Dizzy Gillespie, who was in his brass section as a young musician,

once said of him that "he was always the best trumpet player in his band"), and

he might have become one of the greatest of jazz clarinetists had he not

abandoned the clarinet in 1946.<p>



<p>



Although he is one of only a handful of musicians to have left a mark on jazz

as both an improviser and an orchestrator (Cab Callowa, Benny Goodman, and

Artie Shaw were among the rival bandleaders who played his arrangements in the

thirties and forties), Carter never succeeded in keeping an orchestra together

for very long, and finally disbanded for good in 1946. What makes this so

surprising is that Carter's first band enjoyed the services of Sid Catlett,

perhaps the greatest of big-band drummers, and that Gillespie, Teddy Wilson,

Chu Berry, Ben Webster, and Miles Davis were Carter band members at one time or

another. It probably also hindered Carter that he was in Europe from 1935 to

1938, when America was catching swing fever, and in Hollywood, writing music

for movies and TV, for much of three decades, after playing on the soundtrack

of and helping to orchestrate the music for <I>Stormy Weather</I> in 1943.<p>



<p>



Carter was underutilized and perhaps racially typecast by the studios: 

although he worked on more than two dozen theatrical films, including <I>An 

American in Paris</I>, <I>The Sun Also Rises</I>, <I>The Guns of 

Navarone</I>, and <I>Red Sky at Morning</I>, his only complete scores were 

those for <I>A Man Called Adam</I>, a 1966 jazz movie starring Sammy Davis, 

Jr., and <I>Buck and the Preacher</I>, a 1972 western with Sidney Poitier 

and Harry Belafonte.  Carter's best work for TV was his music for some 

thirty-five episodes of the crime series <I>M Squad</I> in the late 1950s.  

The four selections from <I>M Squad</I> included on <I>All of Me</I> 

(Bluebird 3000-2-RB), a recent reissue, demonstrate Carter's ability to 

produce idiomatically convincing jazz within the framework of TV-genre 

conventions.<p>



<p>



Carter again became a full-time jazz musician around 1976.  His stepped-up 

pace since then, in both playing and composing, has created the happy 

illusion that he is playing better than ever, and we have had more 

opportunities to hear him.  Everyone I know who writes about jazz seems to 

have his own favorite Carter solo recorded since that time.  Mine is his 

virtuoso turn on the standard "Lover Man," from his otherwise uneventful 

1985 album <I>A Gentleman and His Music</I> (Concord Jazz CCD4285).  In 

addition to being the recent solo that best demonstrates Carter's 

undiminished instrumental command, it is also the one that best illustrates 

his confident embrace of contemporary rhythmic values.  Hearing "Lover 

Man," you know at once you're listening to Benny Carter, thanks to that 

enviably urbane intonation of his (which Hodeir, ever the nay-sayer, once 

characterized as "effeminate") and to that rococo approach to harmony he 

once shared with Coleman Hawkins.  Still, this isn't a solo you could 

imagine Carter playing fifty or even twenty years ago, because his 

asymmetrical double-time phrasing is so modern in conception--it's just 

short of abstract, despite his fealty to the melody.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>L</font>ATE last summer Carter shared a bill with the vibraphonists Milt Jackson and

Bobby Hutcherson at Lincoln Center, just up the block from where the apartment

house he lived in as a child once stood; the area was called San Juan Hill in

those days, and it was known as a rough neighborhood. Jackson and Hutcherson

each played a set accompanied by just a rhythm section; then they joined Carter

and a big band for the premiere of a suite called "Good Vibes," which Lincoln

Center had commissioned from Carter for this occasion. Although both the

featured soloists interpreted Carter's new music with relish, neither paid him

the courtesy of performing even one of his tunes during the first half.<p>



<p>



In a way, the evening was typical. The only Carter tune you're ever likely to

hear during a jam session is "When Lights Are Low," which musicians usually

know not from Carter's recordings of it (the first was with the singer

Elisabeth Welch, in 1936, and the most famous was with Lionel Hampton on

vibraphone, three years later) but from the version Miles Davis recorded in

1953, without Carter's elegant bridge. For that matter, Carter himself is

frequently guilty of not featuring enough of his own tunes when he plays

nightclubs and festivals.<p>



<p>



I asked about this when I spoke with him by telephone in his home in southern

California late last year. "That's been because I've always felt that when

people come to hear me, they want to hear me play songs with which they're

already familiar," he told me in a tone intended to communicate that this

policy was the result of practicality not undue modesty. "But you know,

somebody else once asked me the same question, and I told him that I don't play

many of my own tunes because the audience wouldn't know them. He pointed out

that they never will get to know them if I don't play them. But I have started

traveling with lead sheets of my tunes for the musicians I might play with who

don't know them."<p>



<p>



The proof of Carter's genius as a composer can be found on <I>Central City

Sketches</I> (Musicmasters CIJD 60126X), featuring Carter with the American Jazz

Orchestra, a New York repertory ensemble directed by the pianist John Lewis.

This includes flawless performances of Carter compositions ranging in vintage

from "Blues in My Heart" (1931), which would have been a perfect vehicle for

Jackson at Lincoln Center, to the title suite, which Carter completed just in

time for a concert he played with the AJO at Cooper Union a week or so before

the recording session, in 1987. In addition to reviving interest in Carter, the

Cooper Union concert, which was talked about for months afterward, supplied a

rationale for the emerging jazz-repertory movement: it called attention to

still timely masterpieces that weren't likely to be heard in concert unless

someone made a special effort to perform them.<p>



<p>



<I>Marian McPartland Plays the Benny Carter Songbook</I> (Concord Jazz 

CCD4412), with Carter augmenting the pianist McPartland's trio on six of 

eleven tracks, nicely complements <I>Central City Sketches</I>, featuring 

as it does informal interpretations of such outstanding Carter tunes as 

"When Lights Are Low" (as on the disc with the AJO, the bridge is 

restored); "Lonely Woman," sung by Peggy Lee in 1947 and not to be confused 

with pieces of the same name by Ornette Coleman and Horace Silver; "Only 

Trust Your Heart," a bossa nova introduced by Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto 

in the 1964 TV film <I>The Hanged Man</I>; and "Doozy," a sinuous blues that lives 

up to its name, first recorded on <I>Further Definitions</I> and performed twice 

on <I>Central City Sketches</I>.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>C</font>ARTER now records so regularly that it has become possible to pick and choose

among his albums. <I>All That Jazz Live at Princeton</I> (Musicmasters j059-2C), his

latest, recorded in concert last year at Princeton University, where he

frequently conducts master classes, suffers from a humdrum selection of

tunes--nothing new by Carter, who seems unfamiliar with the chord changes to

Thelonious Monk's "Hackensack" and Clifford Brown's "Blues Walk"--and

unrewarding vocals by Carter, the trumpeter Clark Terry, and a glib singer

named Billy Hill. (Hill was once a member of the pop group the Essex, whose

delightful "Easier Said Than Done" reached No. 1 in 1963.) Carter is the only

reason for hearing <I>The Return of Mel Powell</I> (Chiaroscuro CR[D] 301), which was

recorded aboard the S.S. <I>Norway</I> in 1987. Powell, who once played piano in Benny

Goodman's big band and who last year won a Pulitzer for "serious" composition,

sounds as though he's slumming here, or as though he thinks it's still 1938.

His choppy, foursquare rhythm inhibits Carter, who seems more in his element

when surrounded by relative modernists than he does in the company of musicians

from his own era.<p>



<p>



Along with <I>Central City Sketches</I>, the plums in Carter's recent discography are

<I>My Man Benny--My Man Phil</I> (Musicmasters :036-2C), from 1989, on which he piques

the alto saxophonist Phil Woods into some beautifully animated playing, and

<I>Over the Rainbow</I> (Musicmasters 5015-2C), from 1988, which rivals even <I>Further

Definitions</I> in demonstrating Carter's unparalleled skill at writing for

saxophones. The most irresistible of the eight performances on <I>Over the Rainbow</I>

is the standard "Out of Nowhere." After individual choruses by Carter and

fellow saxophonists Frank Wess, Herb Geller, Jimmy Heath, and Joe Temperley

(plus a brief spot by the pianist Richard Wyands), Carter leads the saxophones

through a speedy series of harmonic variations so full of swagger that at first

I assumed I was hearing an orchestration of the solo Coleman Hawkins played on

this tune with Carter and Django Reinhardt in 1937.<p>



<p>



Carter recorded for a variety of labels, large and small, in the 1930s, and

this might explain why--with the exception of a no-longer available boxed set

in the Time-Life Giants of Jazz series--no comprehensive survey of his early

recordings has ever been issued by an American company. Before berating

American companies for not giving us seminal Benny Carter in chronological

order, it's good to remember that these performances are still protected by

copyright in the United States, though they no longer are in Europe.

Classics--a French label that is distributed here by Qualiton Imports (24-02

40th Avenue, Long Island City, MY 11101)--has come to the rescue with five

volumes (so far) of <I>Benny Carter and His Orchestra</I> (Classics 522, 530, 541,

552, and 579).<p>



<p>



In addition to all of Carter's big-band sides through 1940, these splendidly

remastered compact discs include his work with the Chocolate Dandies, a small,

studio-only group drawn from the ranks of the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra and

other big bands, and the twelve ahead-of-their-time-and-then-some performances

recorded in 1933 by the Ellington-smitten Irish composer Spike Hughes and "His

Negro Orchestra," which was actually Carter's big band augmented by such star

soloists as Coleman Hawkins and Red Allen. Carter isn't extensively featured on

the material by Hughes, but his band distinguishes itself in interpreting

Hughes's ambitious scores, and both "Noctourne" and "Music at Midnight" offer

striking examples of Carter's abilities as a clarinetist.<p>



<p>



Reissues like these usually put elder musicians in the hopeless position of

competing with their past accomplishments. Carter actually seems to be gaining

on himself as the years roll by. In baseball it's possible to chart the

progress of a Darryl Strawberry or a Roger Clemens by measuring his record

against that of a Willie Mays or a Sandy Koufax at a similar stage in his

career. In jazz, too, we can measure the accomplishments of Wynton Marsalis as

he nears thirty by comparing them with the accomplishments of Louis Armstrong,

Roy Eldridge, Dizzy Gillespie, or Miles Davis at the same point. We can compare

Sonny Rollins at sixty with Coleman Hawkins at that age. But against what other

jazz octogenarian can we measure Benny Carter? There has never been anyone like

him.<p>

You would think that here, at least,<br>

In dens by night, on tawny sands by day,<br>

Poor Brother Ass would be a kingly beast.<br>

So does the casuarina seem to say,<p>





Whose kindred haziness<br>

Of head is flattering to a bloodshot eye;<br>

So too the palm's blown shadows, which caress<br>

Anointed brows and bodies where they lie,<p>





And Angel's Trumpets, which <br>

Proclaim a musky scent in fleshly tones.<br>

Yet in this island soil that's only rich<br>

In rock and coral and Calusa bones,<p>





It's hardihood that thrives,<br>

As when a screw pine that the gale has downed,<br>

Shooting new prop-roots from its trunk, survives<br>

In bristling disarray by change of ground,<p>





Or the white mangrove, nursed<br>

In sea-soaked earth and air, contrives to expel<br>

From leafstalk glands the salt with which it's cursed,<br>

Or crotons, scorched as by the flames of Hell,<p>





Protectively attire<br>

Their leaves in leather, and so move to and fro<br>

In the hot drafts that stir the sun's harsh fire,<br>

Like Shadrach, Mesach, and Abednego.<p>

        The Coming Immigration Debate,</a> April 1995<br>

		

		A review of Peter Brimelow's <i>Alien Nation: Common Sense About

       America's Immigration Disaster</i>, in which the author finds that Brimelow, an

       Englishman by birth, has summoned up another vision of danger to the common European-American

       stock. Unless radical corrective measures are quickly taken, Brimelow says,

       unchecked Third World immigration will overwhelm the United States -- its culture,

       its economy, and its ethnic identity -- within a matter of a few decades.<p>

		

		<li><a href ="../../election/connection/Immigrat/miles1f.htm">A Bold Proposal 

		on Immigration,</a> June 1994<br>

		California will cease to be a democratic polity unless it lets its Mexican

       immigrants vote in local elections. Politically impossible? Yes -- but a

       that political calculus.<p>

Asickly, timid child by nature, on that October afternoon he was facing thebiggest battle of his young life. He wiped his nose on his sleeve. He had justone chance, just one weapon that the neighborhood bully of that long-agoBronx neighborhood did not have: a gun. <p>"It was incredible. I showed him the gun. That was it!" Laughter bursts anewfrom the handsomely jowled, middle-agedface of Ray Meal as he remembers his first triumph. Sitting in his quietlyopulent Los Angeles office, he is heavily tanned (Meal adores cruising on hisyacht, <i>Marlene</i>, named for his second wife and the mother of hissix-year-old son, Barnabas), and exudes that kind of radiant physical well-beingthe New York executive rarely achieves. His gleeful expression is a sign to thevisitor that the doughty eight-year-old is still there, unwearied by decades ofhigh-stakes gambling on the knife edge of new entertainment technologies. <p>"Ironically, I had a chance to hire the guy later on," Meal continues. "Heowned a janitorial company he could have quadrupled in size! Unfortunately, hisconnections . . ." Meal raises his hands, as if to say "What can you do withpeople like that?" As he does so, gorgeous gold cuff linksa gift from agrateful ex-Attorney General Ed Meese sparkle at his wrists.<p>Suddenly he gets up and walks over to stand pensively next to one of the thirty-sevenfloor-to-ceiling windows that were manufactured especially for him in Venice, Italy. He sighs.<p>"You know, there's a lot of people hurting out there. I'm an old-fashionedliberal Democrat with a capital D, so it hurts me. Here." He gestures towardhis heart. "Right here, I mean."<p><p><p>	Here is a brief silence, and the hum of traffic becomes audible.	Meal, Dwayne Bern, who is a cable-industry analyst at Mincing Barney and a neighborof Meal's in Malibu, and I are seated in Meal's office, which has stunningviews of La Cienega Boulevard. While Meal and Bern resume their discussion of apossible merger with MachoWorldmundo, the Spanish-language news network, I amfree to explore the impressive room. The patrician taste of the man iseverywhere evident. Items chosen for their value and rarity mingle withmementos of Meal's long business life for example, the group photo of the jurythat acquitted him of racketeering in the "Forty-Carat CZ Affair." Still moreitems are of emotional significance--for example, the simple drawing byBarnabas. The drawing will never be worth any money, and yet he has kept it.Ever watchful, Meal, though deep in a business conversation, perceives mythought. "I keep that because my kid did it! I know, I know," he says affably."Another guy in my position would have tossed it long ago. But not me. Let'ssee." He consults his large watch. "Barnabas is out swimming with Cher's kidsright now! He's a great kid. You know what he said to me one time? It made meso proud! He said, `Dad, you're important!' I swear to God, those were hisexact words. I love that kid. See those hunting prints? I got all of them fromLillian Vernon. I just can't imagine letting someone else choose my things forme. Choosing beautiful objects is for me a form of self-expression!"<p>Dwayne Bern speaks up. "He is a giant in his capacity for love, yet is a manwho can hobnob with the Sultan of Brunei!"<p>"But they say I tear the wings off flies, Dwayne," Meal says sadly.<p>"They're trying to knock you off your pedestal, Ray. Jealous!"<p>I am impressed by this demonstration of something for which Ray Meal has becomealmost legendary: the loyalty he inspires in those who work for him.<p>	In the fifty-odd years since that October day when an eight-year-oldlearned a lasting lesson in his fight with the neighborhood bully, Meal haspretty much attained whatever his blunt-fingered hand has reached out to grab--from business empires to the string of well-bornwomen he is known for dressing in a luxury that is astounding even by thestandards of this mega-rich milieu. At the same time, his name has become a byword for the kind ofopenhearted management style that may in the end be our only advantage over theJapanese. Meal considers this openheartedness to be the legacy of his reveredfather, George, who died in 1955, leaving his son with a profitablefoundation-garment business. Its motto, "We Cater to Stouts," has beensentimentally engraved on every sheet of letterhead printed, and in stone onthe fa&ccedil;ade of every building Ray Meal has occupied, since he forged theconglomerate that is now known as Control Panties-Raymedia Communications.<p>Asked whether he has enjoyed beating out so many competitors, Meal concedesthat he has. "Oh, definitely. Very much so."<p>But now that he is embroiled in controversy, his credit--and hiscredibility stretched to the limit, the question is, Can Ray Meal win onemore?<p>Over the past six years Meal has made no secret of his desire to control themultimedia programming-and-distribution empire of his longtime nemesis ArnoldCreem. Years ago, when Meal and Creem alone foresaw the potential of cable,their faith provided a bond for the two wary entrepreneurial loners--much as iftwo cowboys had crossed paths on the trail and for one night swapped yarns andslept by the same fire. But all that seems long ago now, and in fact, accordingto the people around Creem, never happened. <p>Nevertheless, Meal insists that the two men are friends. "Are you kidding?While the networks and telephone companies are stumbling around with theirpants around their ankles, and Arnold and I <em>alone</em> foresaw thepotential of cable? Don't listen to gossip! Arnold and I are buddies that go way back."<p>When I ask whether he is worried about what promises to be a titanic duel withhis friend, he replies, "I'm not afraid of Arnold. I respect him, but I don'tfear him. I esteem him, but he doesn't get me apprehensive. No way he evenmakes me self-conscious!"<p><p><p>	He's terrified of Creem. Creem is, like, his nemesis." 	I am speaking privately with a concerned Dwayne Bern, a veteran of the first titanic Meal-Creem dealand a recipient of some of Meal's greathearted largesse.<p>"That was in 1989. I'd told Ray I didn't know what to get my kid for hisbirthday. Next thing I know, there's this big package arriving from LillianVernon! Ironically, the same day I hear about the mess with Creem. It was areal tough time for all of us. Just the uncertainty, if nothing else! And I'lltell you something Ray won't discuss. Ray Meal's hair was brownish with orangehighlights. The next day it's white!" Bern sighs. "I just hope to hell it isn'tall starting up again with this new buyout thing. I mean, you get together twoguys who <i>both</i> foresaw the potential of cable, and you get them in alife-and-death conflict of these dimensions . . ."<p>When I remark that he looks dejected, Bern explains that he hates what he terms"all this cannibalism." He has clearly been scarred by events that occurred thelast time Meal and Creem tangled--in the Forty-Carat CZ Affair, when it tooksix months for the dust to settle on Wall Street. By the time it did, twovenerable brokerage houses had shut their doors for the last time, and Ray Mealhad come within a hair of being ousted from the chairmanship and board ofdirectors of the very empire he had built. He had also been indicted on sixfelony counts.<p>Despite a rocky start Meal was stung by the public reaction to the news that hehad drawn $72 million in salary and bonuses the previous year 1989 had been abanner year for him <i>and</i> for Creem. But no one who foresaw the potentialof cable in those days can forget the ludicrous spectacle presented by a trioof television networks craven, and perhaps bloated with complacency as theyrisked everything to gain ownership of the syndication rights to the long-canceledseries <em>Love, American Style</em>. On the West Coast, Meal was taking amuch-deserved week off, planning to spend it at his palatial Malibu estate,where, besides gourmet cooking, he and Marlene enjoy skateboarding.<p>"Those bastards didn't even bother to call a meeting of the full board, forChrist's sake!" I am sitting in a hot tub under an angry red moon with stockyAngelo Imbimbo, Ray Meal's former bodyguard and longtime companion. "One minuteeverything's fine and dandy. `Glad the old boy's taking some time off!' `Hey,boss, don't worry about a thing!' Next thing you know, it's <em>'Kweek!'</em>"He makes the familiar throat-cuttinggesture. "I thought the mob was bad!" he concludes ruefully. "Course Creem wasbehind it. He engineered the whole thing. From <em>outside</em> thecompany!"<p>"Audacious? Sure, Arnold is audacious," remarks longtime Creem friend JerryMathers. "I'd say Arnold is one of the most audacious guys around. And he'dbeen dreaming of that for a long, long time. Why? Because Arnold Creem had the<em>distribution</em>, but he needed the <em>software</em>. It's a classicbusiness situation. He had the Christian Broadcasting Network; he had the ownership of<em>Hey, Vern, It's Ernest</em> for the next twenty years, along with the much-ballyhooednew series <em>FBI: Female Body Inspectors</em>. Can you blame him if he alsowanted the wireless-videophone capacity whereby viewers could call each otherup and discuss the show afterward from their cars, actually seeing each other'sfacial expressions while they talked? Because let's face it otherwise you don'tget the nuance!<p>"Once he could take control of the software, cellular-, and sensi-phonedivisions, favorite series characters could appear at Control Panties' fivetheme parks. Do you wonder Arnold was drooling? But the real jewel in theControl Panties crown was Meal's priceless library of old Laraine Day movies,which would fall right smack into Arnold's lap!" Mathers chuckles. "It wasincredible. Control Panties-Raymedia stock fell seventy-five percent over thenext thirty days. Meal was desperate to get his hands on some capital. Hetalked to everybody, he went everywhere. He had three cellular phones in hiscar! But when all that about Prince Charles came out, he had them all removed.Unfortunately for Ray Meal, though, Creem doesn't like to be pushed, and he hasnerves of steel. In other words, Arnold knows how to wait. Well, when it wasall over, only the Sultan of Brunei came through for Meal, and it was adisappointing thirty million. For him that's about the same as `Gosh, I'd liketo help, but . . .' Meal even went crawling to Sheila Creem to try to get heron his side! Well, everybody knows what happened next. Toto Schultz andAll-Butter Candies!"<p><p><p>	He felt that the world was changing, becoming the playground of a	 few media giants. Sure, I wanted in! And by the end of 1989 Ray Meal needed<em>me</em>."<p>Although Toto Schultz, chairman and CEO of All-Butter Candies, was born into anold moneyed family, you'd never know it to look at his face, which is scarredand thuglike. His Orlon clothes look slept in, and his accent is pure Brooklyn.In contrast, Meal is always impeccably turned out by his Bond Street tailor,his taste in shirts running to sober pinstripes, his shoes generally the loaferor slip-on type, always highly polished and well fitting. He also douses himself liberallywith Wild Musk men's cologne before any meeting he deems important. <p>As for the events leading up to Schultz's decision to make a large infusion ofcapital into Control Panties-Raymedia, none of the men involved will speak ofthem in detail. Even Dwayne Bern is afraid. What is known is that after theapproach was made by Schultz ($50 million in stock, $25 in cash), Meal had onelast, desperate meeting with Creem. He flew into the Silverado Country Club oneday in late November for a private meeting with Creem, who keeps an attractivetwo-bedroom condo on the golf course there. It was on this occasion that Mealpresented Creem with the famous Lalique crystal cream pitcher, with the words"To me you're not fat!" etched on one side and "I like you!" on the other.<p>"Ray was always different that way," muses Tony Imbimbo. "When Gianni Agnelliof Turin turned down his request, Ray didn't just let it go at that. He had acow's udder sewed onto a monkey and sent it to Agnelli. It's an Italian thing Itold him about. He got a big kick out of it. But that's the kind of prank helovesthe more elaborate the better! Ray has--how can I put it? a big, bigheart!" Imbimbo sighs and says, "We have a way of saying it in Italian, butEnglish is such a cold language."<p>"Another time was when he had Diane Sawyer and a film crew walk onto their boatjust as his wife, Marlene, was screaming, 'Chintz headboards, you stupidpansy!' at the captain. I guess she thought he was the decorator." Imbimbochuckles quietly at the memory. "After that Ray had a little bit more controlin the marriage."<p>I ask Imbimbo about rumors that Meal himself may have an ungovernable temper,and he says he has never heard that. Yet I find many who admit they areterrified.<p>"I would say I am tough, yes, but not nasty," Meal says when I ask him aboutthis, later on the day of our Los Angeles meeting. "Those who think otherwisemay be misinterpreting me."<p>At this point Meal seems anxious to change the subject. I see a return tochildlike, spontaneous joy in his plump features.<p>"Did you see this? Hey, did you see this?" Meal hands me a large framedphotograph of a dark-haired youth. "It's Eric, my love child. I will not name his mother! (Arnold Creemsays it was Agnes Moorhead, but it wasn't!) Isn't he great? Just graduatedRutgers!" When I ask what Eric's major was, Meal pauses for thought and thensays, "Gymnastics!" <p>As my afternoon with Meal draws to an end, I ask him what lies ahead. "Themerger with Creem. But it's in the lap of the gods. Hey, I think I'll callDwayne Bern. Want to listen in? We're gonna talk about MachoWorldmundo again.<em>Worldmundo!</em>" he yells joyously.<p><p><p>	Kidding aside, at that evening parting Ray Meal for the first time looked	his age. I was not to see him again until one and a half years later, on theoccasion of his triumphant press conference celebrating Control Panties-Raymedia's first dividend in four years. We gathered in the Capitol rotunda, inWashington, D.C., which had been newly redecorated for the occasion. In a briefstatement an ebullient Ray Mealwith Barnabas at his side--thanked his patientstockholders and his wife, Marlene, and announced the retirement of Mr. TotoSchultz from the board of directors of Control Panties-Raymedia Communications.("Toto," he said, turning to his friend, "it's what the Greeks call fate.") Inconclusion he said huskily, "And Arnold, I know you're out there listening. Mydoor is always open. The cool, serene beauty of Laraine Day awaits yourviewing. As you know, Marlene and I have built a screening room with everyluxury you can think of, including a seat with your name on it, Arnold,dear."<p>The audience was hushed, as if mindful that here was a demonstration of thegiant capacity for love they had heard so much about--perhaps the trait forwhich Ray Meal will be most remembered. The eyes of a hundred journalists and athousand more of the merely curious were glued to the portly figure in the trimBond Street suit, as he mopped his face with a Hermes scarf, handed to himquickly by his wife. He gestured with the scarf and cleared his throat.<p>"Arnold, think it over one last time! Together we could be, we could be . . .Time Warner! Time Warner without the debt! Thank you, everybody! Thanks forlistening!"<p>Thousands of panty-shaped balloons began their descent from the lofty Capitol dome, as what was probablyone of the most hardened, cynical audiences in the history of the world filedout of the august building. Yet these people seemed to me undeniably movedsomewere sobbing. So persuasive was Meal's brief statement, so magical was the manhimself, that many undoubtedly resolved then and there to write morethoughtfully about Control Panties-Raymedia in the future. Many, perhaps, madea private vow to support in print Control Panties' right to merge with ArnoldCreem, in order that, in accordance with their rights as citizens, the Americanpublic may watch shows like <em>FBI: Female Body Inspectors</em>. <p></blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

align=right hspace=10 vspace=10  alt="Langewiesche Photo">							



<font size=5>"E</font>nclosed are Two Pieces on Algeria." With those words,  typed on plain white

bond, William Langewiesche introduced himself to the editors of <i>The Atlantic

Monthly</i>.  Although neither piece quite stood on its own, the editors were

drawn to the unusual grace and power of Langewiesche's writing and sent him on

assignment to North Africa for a more ambitious piece of reporting. The result

was the November, 1991,<i> </i>cover story,  "The World in Its Extreme" -- his

first article to appear in a general-interest magazine. (He had, however,

written frequently for aviation magazines;  he is a professional pilot and

first sat at the controls of an airplane at the age of five.)  Since that

article, from which his recent book <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec

/obidos/ISBN=0679429824/theatlanticmonthA/"><i>Sahara Unveiled:  A Journey Across the

Desert </i></a>(1996) grew, Langewiesche has reported on a diversity of subjects

for <i>The Atlantic</i>:  travel in the Sahara, the Sudanese Islamic

government,  the "banked turn" in aviation, and the U.S.-Mexican Border -- the

last a two-part story that led to his first book, <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec

/obidos/ISBN=0679759638/theatlanticmonthA/"><i>Cutting for Sign

</i></a>(1995). Currently at work on a book about flying, he hopes soon to make his

way to the Himalayas. <p>

<font size=5>K</font>HARTOUM, the capital of Sudan, was built in splendor by the British at the

confluence of the Blue and White Niles. It has changed since colonial times. I

landed there in the heat and blackness of midnight, and shared the airport cab

with an aging American who looked as if he had drifted too long. The cab was a listing Renault with a

roof rack. The driver wore rags, and drove anxiously, leaning forward over the

wheel. The nightly curfew was in effect, and armed soldiers loomed out of the

darkness at the intersections to check our identities. No one spoke. I guessed

that the American was in sales-- of what, I didn't ask. Sweat streamed down his

face. We took him to the Hilton, near a bridge guarded by tanks. He argued with

the driver over the fare, and then came up close to me and almost spat out his

words. "You're gonna get ripped."<p>



	The cab carried me deeper into the city, through dark, deserted streets, past

crumbling buildings and more soldiers. I noticed a boarded-over flophouse, a

dormant gas station, a refrigerator lying open amid the rubble. The place might

have suffered artillery strikes, but had not; war has not visited Khartoum

itself for a century. Under cover of the curfew, I knew, the secret police were

out and about, making arrests. I had already heard about the so-called ghost

houses into which their victims disappear, sometimes forever. The victims are

those said to be enemies of the Islamic revolution that swept over Sudan in

1989, and that promised to bring good government, in the form of God, to this

godforsaken nation.<p>



	Greater Khartoum is a dispersed conglomeration of about five million people.

It sprawls for forty miles from desolate refugee camps on the southern

outskirts, north past the airport and the city center, across the two Niles,

and through the neighborhoods of Omdurman and North Khartoum. Diminished by its

poverty, it never seems that large. Here and there office towers stand like

rocks above the sea of crumbling concrete and adobe. The towers are designed

for elevators and air conditioners in a city subject to daily power outages.<p>



	Oil-rich Arabs are to blame for the towers. The British are harder to judge.

The Sudanese blame them for the civil war that has pitted the successive

governments of Khartoum against rebels in the south. That war has been fought

most years since shortly before the British pulled out, in 1956. And it is true

that the national borders as drawn by the British seem to invite trouble. They

enclose the largest country in Africa and the Middle East, and one of the most

hopeless. With a territory nearly a third the size of the United States, Sudan

has practically no industry and few natural resources beyond river water and

some untapped oil reserves. Poverty, famine, and sickness are endemic.

Moreover, although Sudan is strongly Muslim, it is not uniformly so: a quarter

of the Sudanese, who in total number about 25 million, are Christians or

animists, and they show no desire to convert to Islam. The Muslims themselves

are not uniformly sectarian. Sudan is further riven by ethnic loyalties (the

country encompasses some 500 ethnic groups) and loyalties to region and to

tribe. This diversity lies behind the civil war, which in recent years has

driven perhaps a million non-Muslim refugees from the southern war zone into

the tattered camps in and around Khartoum, in the north. Their suffering is not

new. War has been a fact of life in Sudan for centuries. The British were naive

to believe they could impose standards of fair play on that troubled land.<p>



	But the British deserve credit for what they did achieve. Beyond Khartoum,

they built the roads, railroads, and irrigation canals that continue magically

to support the city. And at least their administration buildings were

functional. Britain's neoclassical and stolid brick structures still house

government ministries along the tree-lined banks of the Blue Nile.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>ODAY those ministries are controlled by revolutionaries -- radical Muslims who

have instituted a vigorous and ideological government based on the teachings of

the Prophet Muhammad. They are of course part of the much larger revival

sweeping the Muslim world. Scorned as "fundamentalists" by their opponents, the

Sudanese leaders prefer a less loaded label -- they call themselves "Islamists."

Since coming to power in 1989, they have turned their nation into the second

radical Islamic state, after Iran. Their success in attaining power has had

compelling effects on all of North Africa and much of the Middle East, where

many countries teeter on the brink of their own Islamic revolutions. This has

disturbed the West. The United States has been angered in particular by Sudan'

s foreign policy -- by its encouragement of revolutionaries beyond its borders,

its close friendship with Iran, and the help it gives to Islamic Jihad, Hamas,

and other international terrorist groups, whose warriors are said to train on

Sudanese soil. The U. S. government, which had already led a campaign to cut

off financial assistance to Sudan, last year added the country to its list of

terrorist nations.<p>



	But terrorism is not the important story in Khartoum. In fact, the issue of

terrorism -- immediate though it seems -- may deflect one from the task of

contemplating the character of the broader Islamic revolution. Fifteen years

after the fall of the Shah the revolution has spread beyond the Shiites of

Iran, transformed itself, and gathered force among the Sunnis, who constitute

90 percent of the world's Muslims. It holds out the hope, its apologists say,

of establishing forms of authority based on a conception of life uniquely

adapted to some of the most dissatisfied and ungovernable places in the world.

The movement seems to be shaping up as one of the great political upheavals of

our century, and maybe of the next.<p>



	The revolution is still young and disorganized. It includes a bewildering

array of political strategies and religious beliefs. This is hardly surprising:

there are nearly a billion Muslims in the world, and they are anything but

homogeneous. Militant Islamists quarrel constantly over what constitutes the

"true" Islam, an especially self-righteous debate that darkens their future

with the possibility of internecine war. Nonetheless, their differences may be

less important than they once were. A remarkable characteristic of this

revolution is its continuing appeal <i>throughout</i> the Muslim world. Islamists

share the confidence of battle. More important, they believe in a common

destination -- a society under the just rule of God. And many of them believe

they have a powerful tool to work with. It is the ancient system of Islamic

law, greatly revitalized, called the shari'a.<p>



	In its widest definition "shari'a" means "the path to the watering place." In

its narrower definition it means "Islamic jurisprudence," an accumulation of

laws and procedures based on the Koran and on knowledge of Muhammad's ways, as

interpreted by classical schools of legal thought. The two definitions -- the

religious path and the law -- are in fact the same. Because Islam considers God

to be everywhere, it does not separate religion from government. This means

that the shari'a cannot distinguish between sin and civil infraction. But this

legal philosophy is not as primitive as it sometimes looks. The shari'a

recognizes that most sins are trivial. And although it includes harsh

punishments such as flogging, amputation, and stoning to death, it also

includes safeguards for the accused, at least in theory. In any event, the

Islamists who came to power have tried to use the shari'a beyond crime and

punishment, as a blueprint for a just and harmonious society.<p>



	Five years after the revolution in Sudan the Islamists have brought about

almost the exact opposite of what, to judge from their prior writings, they

intended. The civil war rages, the secret police operate without restriction,

the press is censored, the military reigns, and political opponents of the

Islamists and the military languish in ghost houses when they are not simply

killed. It is true that life has never been easy in Sudan, and it would have

been unrealistic to have expected any ideology to save the Sudanese from

themselves. But by most measures -- and especially by the measure of political

oppression -- Sudan is worse off as an Islamic state than it was before. That

would be easier to understand if the Islamist leaders were -- like others

within the revolution -- simple authoritarians, believing in the rule of the

sword. That has been the way of strong Muslim rulers of the past. To some

extent it is the way of Iran today. But the leaders of Sudan presented

themselves as something new. Though fervent Muslims, they are not clerics. They

think of themselves as progressives, which within the context of Islamic

tradition they indeed are. Their idealism is, in a perverse way, what makes

Sudan so interesting. Like so many would be reformers in other places and other

times, the professors proposed enlightenment but delivered a nightmare. Sudan

today offers a glimpse of what the future may hold for other Islamic countries

that pursue a radical Muslim dream. It is a leading example of the capacity of

Islamic revolution to thwart its own ambitions.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>K</font>HARTOUM University is the seat of Sudan's Islamist revolution. It was built by

the British, and originally named Gordon Memorial College, after Charles

"Chinese" Gordon, a general who was speared and decapitated by rebellious

Sudanese shortly before dawn on January 26, 1885. For most of the nineteenth

century Sudan had been subject to military rule by Egypt, which in turn was

gradually becoming a British holding. Gordon was a famous troubleshooter who

had once served on loan to Egypt as the governor of Sudan, and who was sent

back to Khartoum to organize an orderly retreat in the face of overwhelming

rebel forces. Instead he organized Khartoum's defense, which failed after about

a year. The victorious Sudanese had risen under a Muslim messiah, the Mahdi,

who now moved across the river and built a new Islamic capital, at Omdurman.

The Mahdi died soon afterward, but his Islamic nation lived on for thirteen

years, until British and Egyptian troops returned and defeated it bloodily in

September of 1898.<p>



	The British were conscientious administrators as well as good soldiers, and

among the elites of Khartoum they gained admirers by their sincere efforts to

improve the country. The pride of their colonial government was the founding of

the brick college on the banks of the Blue Nile. After national independence,

in 1956, the renamed college became a hotbed of Sudanese politics. On campus

and in government the "graduate constituencies" argued earnestly. Their debates

had an ineffectual quality that sympathetic outsiders regularly confused with

gentleness.<p>



	That was the world of young Hassan al-Turabi. Today, at age sixty-one, he is

the power behind Sudan's Islamist regime. A small man with a gray beard and a

thin, boyish face, Turabi wears a turban and the whitest robes I have ever

seen. His shoes are unstained by the streets -- no mean feat for anyone in

Khartoum. The white Mercedes in which he gets around the city is equally

spotless.<p>



	I have heard Turabi called the Madison Avenue ayatollah, because he has slick

manners and obvious problems with credibility. At a 1992 discussion with

scholars in Florida, he countered reports of torture in Sudan -- widely

confirmed by human-rights groups -- by saying, among other things, that the

Sudanese are by nature sensitive, and therefore prone to overreact to

late-night interviews under the glare of strong lights. During two

conversations I had with him Turabi spoke smoothly of Sudan's opposition to

terrorism. He also denied that he played any role in government. His assertions

were strangely transparent, as if he did not expect me to believe them, but

needed somehow to reassure himself.<p>



	Nonetheless, Turabi is a person of substance. A legal scholar with advanced

degrees from London and Paris, he has served as Sudan's Attorney General and as

the dean of the law school at Khartoum University. He is a devoted

revolutionary, but one who is more interested in the social effects of Islam

than in its strictly spiritual aspects. In Islamist terms he is a believer in

not being held to interpretations of Islamic law that are too literal-minded or

old-fashioned.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>A</font> BIT of theory is necessary. Muhammad, who lived about 600 years after Jesus,

was a reformer of law and faith. By discouraging clerical hierarchies, he

founded a government and religion based on personal and direct devotion to

God.<p>



	But rather than accepting his invitation to contemplation and flexibility, his

followers retreated into dogma. This began to happen soon after his death, and

was tied in to leadership struggles. It was formalized 300 years later, in the

tenth century, when the Sunni Muslims and some Shiite Muslims declared the

period of <i>ijtihad</i> to be closed. "<i>Ijtihad</i>" is an important word: it means the

interpretation of the Prophet's laws to encompass issues not discussed directly

in the traditional sources -- ranging from the most personal questions of faith

to more public questions of government and law. Muhammad specifically

encouraged <i>ijtihad</i>. When his followers declared it closed, they meant not only

that the shari'a was complete but also that individuals should have no thoughts

of their own. They condemned Muslims to a thousand years of literalness.<p>



	It is the issue of reopening <i>ijtihad</i> that has animated many modern Islamist

intellectuals and clerics. It is no coincidence that an Islamic revolution

first occurred in Iran, where <i>ijtihad</i> was a principle that had been kept alive

by Shiites. It is a principle that Turabi, a Sunni Muslim, has long espoused.

Whether in economics, education, or political thinking, Turabi argues, the need

for change is obvious. In Muslim lands the Western model of secular government

has produced some modern downtowns and highways, but otherwise mostly

dictatorship and misery. The Sudanese couch their rhetoric in a wistful

idealization of the past, because their tradition requires it. But what has

actually seemed to inspire them is the chance to rework society along new

lines. In theory, as expressed in Islamist writings, these new lines include

modern egalitarian concepts of individual dignity and worth and human rights.

<i>Ijtihad</i> is the tool that allows the Islamists to discover these principles

within their own faith, rather than borrowing them from abroad.<p>



	Because of the importance of the Sudanese experiment in Islamic eyes, Turabi

has become perhaps the most influential Islamist in the world. Visiting

Islamists wait to see him in an enclosed veranda that leads to his office.

There are no obvious security precautions. Turabi was once assaulted and nearly

killed, but that was in Canada. In Khartoum an attacker would have nowhere to

run.<p>



	People who have known Turabi since he was young, and who themselves have lived

through the frustrations of the postcolonial period of Sudanese history, say

they are not surprised by his rise. Turabi was the brilliant son of a religious

leader from an eastern province. He came to Khartoum in 1951, as a young man,

to study law.<p>



	While his fellow students espoused Western solutions to Sudan's problems --

Marxism, socialism, liberal democracy -- Turabi joined a small and powerless

group called the Muslim Brotherhood. After graduating from law school he spent

the better part of a decade studying in Europe, and upon his return he took

control of the Muslim Brotherhood movement. Sudan was by then eight years into

independence, and already terribly troubled. Though plaintive, the explanation

of Abdelwahab El-Affendi, a Sudanese Islamist, is succinct: "The alternatives

being peddled to the Islamic world view . . . were no more than second-hand

second-rate misunderstandings of ideologies that were in themselves flawed."

The same might be argued about the Islamist ideology today, but by the time of

the 1989 military coup that brought Turabi and the Islamists to power, the

Sudanese were torn inside and too tired to argue.<p>



	The details bear some sorting out. Islamic law in a modern politicized form

actually came to Sudan in September of 1983, before the Islamist coup, when the

long-standing dictator Jaafar Nimeiri introduced a new shari'a-based penal

code. Nimeiri wanted to hang on to power and stamp out crime. At first the

citizens of Khartoum turned out by the thousands to enjoy the spectacle of

Islamic discipline. The shari'a sharply reduced crime, but then metamorphosed

into political terror. To enforce the code, Nimeiri established summary courts

that held ten-minute trials and dispensed thousands of punishments, including

floggings, amputations, and executions. Amputees from those years are a common

sight on the streets of Khartoum.<p>



	This was hardly justice as the Islamists envisioned it, but they were willing

to compromise. To his discredit, Turabi supported the new laws, and openly

turned against the abuse only at the very end, after Nimeiri ordered his

arrest. Nimeiri was overthrown in 1985, and after a short period of military

rule Sudan passed through a few years of real but ineffective democracy.

Islamic punishments were suspended, though Nimeiri's "September Laws" remained

on the books, because by then it would have been politically impossible to get

rid of them. Khartoum was caught in the larger currents of the Middle East, and

by popular sentiment was becoming more devout.<p>



	The army officers who seized control in 1989 were themselves radicalized

Muslims. They were headed by Lieutenant General Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who, as

the head of a junta called the Revolutionary Command Council, remains formally

in charge today. Soon after the coup the junta quietly handed power to Turabi

and his Islamist brethren in the National Islamic Front, a political group that

had grown out of the Muslim Brotherhood. This was done by turning to Turabi for

guidance, and inviting his operatives to infiltrate the civil bureaucracy and

the military creating, in effect, a shadow government. Early in 1991 the

government of Sudan instituted a new criminal code that revitalized the

shari'a. Turabi himself, despite his obvious authority, remains in what might

be called the foreground of the background.<p>



	This state of affairs has led to ambiguity about who is really in charge --

the military strongmen, who are increasingly reviled for their bloody ways, or

their brainier friends outside the army, the Islamist intellectuals led by

Turabi. The situation is often as unclear to the players as it is to the

spectators. Factions shift within factions, and each requires the others to

define itself. The disarray is useful to Turabi. It allows him to duck

responsibility and claim credit as needed.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HAT Turabi can sometimes duck responsibility is no doubt a tactical

convenience. That he often needs to, however, points up a profound problem

within the Islamist regime itself. It is simply this: there is no imaginable

scheme by which the new and enlightened shari'a can function as a universal and

stabilizing legal system in a country as fragmented as Sudan.<p>



	This is so whether or not one accepts Turabi and the Islamists at face value

-- accepts them, that is, as sincere idealists. To accept them at face value,

one must understand that those, like Turabi, who would return to the path of

Muhammad by reopening <i>ijtihad</i> seek also to conform to the Islamic ideal in

another matter: its tolerance. Islam intends to be respectful of certain other

beliefs. This tolerance means that in an Islamic nation that takes itself

seriously as such, each tolerated religious community must be allowed to live

by its own laws. In a nation like Sudan, where God appears to people in widely

different ways, this raises insurmountable obstacles to the universal

applicability of Islamic law.<p>



	Even if this were not the case, the fact is that there are many who resent and

bitterly oppose Turabi's shari'a -- not only among the Christians and animists

in the south or in the growing refugee camps around Khartoum but also in the

Muslim sects and among the large number of faithful Muslims who would prefer to

see Sudan become a secular state. Whether because it is self-limiting in theory

or because it is divisive in practice, the shari'a is hardly a system of legal

authority that can unite a heterogeneous and quarrelsome nation. And whether

for the one reason or the other, a large portion of Sudan is effectively

exempted from, or resistant to, the shari'a.<p>



	And so one faces a situation where governance, such as it is in Sudan, exists

on two planes. There is the public plane: The Islamists have established

shari'a courts and staffed them with ideologues who stick to the letter and

spirit of the law. Shari'a courts duly handle certain classes of infractions,

and those who come under their jurisdiction find themselves living in a

fundamentalist Muslim state. I have heard of cases in which, true to the ideal

of tolerance, Christians who have landed in shari'a court for violations of

Islamic strictures have found themselves exonerated.<p>



	And then there is the not-so-public plane, which consists of the military, and

the secret police forces, and other groups acting with or without the direct

knowledge of Turabi or the military leaders, who fill the vacuum left by the

inadequacy of civil government with a regime of continual terror. Opponents of

the military do not find their way into shari'a courts. They are taken out and

shot.<p>



How do the two planes coexist? There is, I believe, a deep psychological

process at work in Sudan, in which the state-directed terror is not

acknowledged philosophically by many of the Islamist intellectuals -- not to

the outside world, and perhaps not in any fundamental sense to themselves. As

noted, there hangs about Turabi himself an atmosphere of reflexive denial.

Rather than overtly plotting the political terror, the Islamists turn their

backs on it, and let it happen as a matter of distasteful necessity in

revolutionary times.<p>



	Not all the Sudanese Islamists, of course, bother to pay even lip service to

tolerance. Hard-liners within the National Islamic Front tell Turabi that

compromise with non-Muslims must be for outside consumption only, that he must

win the war in the south and then impose Islamic standards -- if not Islam

itself -- on everyone. Turabi surely understands their argument. If he does not

impose the shari'a on everyone, the Islamic revolution will flounder. But if he

does impose the shari'a on everyone, the Sudanese revolution will lose whatever

it has of a soul. So Turabi wavers, and dreams beyond the nation -- dreams the

old dream, of a pan-lslamic movement that might someday sweep the world.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE enemies of the revolution should take no pleasure in the shari'a's inherent

weakness. As they applaud the concessions made to certain non-Muslims and

summon international pressure to limit the more corporal of the Islamic

punishments, they must also face the other half of the equation--that outside

the realm of the shari'a system, extralegal punishments have proliferated. The

secret police pervade Khartoum.<p>



	As Turabi admits, prisoners of the secret police have been interviewed under

strong lights. They have also been whipped, sliced, burned, clubbed, shackled

and hung by their wrists or ankles, mutilated, blinded, shocked, and starved.

They have been deprived of light, space, water, medicine, and sleep. They have

been lowered into deep wells poisoned with animal carcasses. They have been

subjected to mock executions. The horrors are reported to be more common in the

provincial cities, some of which I visited, where zealous authorities can

operate out of the view of anyone in the capital who might be inclined to scold

them. In the western mountains and in the south, where the shari'a does not

pretend to apply, there is effectively no law but war. The victims in the

battle zones are rebel soldiers and spies, and their families, and people who

are known to them or who might be.<p>



	In Khartoum the victims are all criminals and rabble-rousers, real and

imagined. It is probably inevitable that the university has been a special

target for the government's anger. When students marched in 1992 against the

rising cost of education, soldiers moved onto the campus, shot several

demonstrators, arrested others, and closed the school for the rest of the year.

Department heads have been purged, Islamist stalwarts promoted, and professors

intimidated. At the department of political science, when I asked one academic

about opposition to the regime, he looked frightened and would give no answer

except "We teach the curriculum."<p>



	In another office an important Islamist was only too glad to talk. He was

young, slight, and so soft-spoken that at times I could not hear him. I was

interested because he was once known as a moderate, and probably still thought

of himself as one. We discussed restaurants in Princeton, New Jersey, where he

had been in school. Mostly, though, I listened to him talk politics. His

subject was the Foreign Ministry, but it could as well have been the

university, or Khartoum, or the nation at large. He said, "The Islamists

discovered that taking power and placing a few people is not enough. The

diplomats at the ministry were brought up in the Western way, and they do not

always defend Sudan as they should. As an Islamist, you have a different view

of national interests. You would love to win over the diplomats, and re-educate

them without losing their expertise. You would love to inject them with your

own views, but this is very difficult."<p>



And so you apply a little force.<p>



	During my stay I spoke often to dissident students, singly and in groups. They

sought me out on the campus and found me at the cafeterias that serve soft

drinks by the Blue Nile, and in the courtyards, and on the open pathways where

they could see others who approached. They complained about discrimination,

intimidation, censorship, and hypocritical government. They complained about

their poverty and their future. Some were Catholics or Copts, but most were

sincere Muslims. And yet, rather than rejecting the Islamist creed, many had

plunged deeper into it. And why not? Trapped like prisoners from birth, they

sought solace and meaning in their faith. They reminded me of a man I had seen

sitting on the street by the Ministry of Justice. He was emaciated and

obviously very ill. As I passed, he looked up and said, "Hello, I'm fine." He

wore Muslim dress, and held a small Koran in his hands. His only solace was

that his faith was still strong.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>C</font>RIPPLED no less by their apparent capacity for self-deception than by the

shari'a, those in power who can be described as idealists are still trying to

build an Islamic democracy. Their attempts at devising a system of public

participation amid the prevailing horror of oppression are as ambitious as they

are unremittingly pathetic.<p>



	The officer charged with designing a new Sudanese governmental structure --

one that might somehow accommodate the country's fractious elements -- is

Brigadier General Hassan Hamadain, a heavy man in a green uniform with stars on

his shoulders. He had a furrowed brow, and an uncertain manner that I found

endearing. We talked in his uncluttered pine-paneled office, which he wanted me

to see. With no apparent irony he said, "In Sudan we are very sensitive to

dictatorships, and we try to avoid them."<p>



	He later said, "All political systems known to the world have been implemented

in Sudan, and they have all failed to provide stability." By this he meant

multi-party and one-party systems. The solution, to be contained within a

federal structure, will allow no parties at all. It will consist of an ornate

arrangement of "cascading congresses," through which power will flow upward

from neighborhood and village committees, through state and national

assemblies, to, finally, the presidency itself.<p>



	Having assured me that this scheme will answer Islam's twin requirements of

consultation and consensus, the general launched into the details, reading

haltingly from notes that he seemed to have stayed up late preparing. He had a

telescoping pointer with which he occasionally directed my attention to a

colored flow chart on the wall. Here in Khartoum, where the real power

structure is intentionally ill-defined, his chart seemed outlandish. But I

think he had convinced himself. He had the willingness of a student assigned

the project of dreaming up a government.<p>



	Afterward I asked, "How do you keep your utopia from turning into a nightmare?

In Libya the neighborhood committees have been turned around and used for

control."<p>



	He looked wounded. "We are trying to give people a free hand to build social

institutions in all areas."<p>



	"How can you do that and ban parties simultaneously?"<p>



	He searched through his notes. "Parties are vehicles of modern institutions.

Sudan is a traditional society."<p>



	"Even so, by banning parties you don't solve the problem of the tribes and

religious sects."<p>



	"You're right. We need time to eliminate this problem."<p>



	I asked him how that would be done, and how much time. He did not know. I

remembered the Attorney General, a sinister man who, when asked about the

consequences of the shari'a's not being applied to some non-Muslims, answered,

"Yes, I'm thinking about setting up a committee to look into it."<p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE importance of Sudan is not Sudan. Before giving his life there a century

ago, Charles Gordon wrote, "What a useless possession is this land!" Hassan

al-Turabi may find it so as well. Gone already are the fond days of

abstraction. Sudanese Islamists now scramble to distance themselves from the

increasingly unpopular military junta that gave them power. But even if they

survive its eventual downfall, their movement will take turns they can neither

predict nor follow. Islamic revolution is not the monolithic thing of the

popular imagination. Its glory will pass on -- to Algeria, perhaps, or Egypt --

leaving Sudan to poverty and division. Turabi is an observant man and a student

of history. As a Muslim, he has to accept the frustrations of his fate: to have

been born ambitious and idealistic -- and Sudanese. Perhaps in his most private

thoughts he knows already that he will die disillusioned. There will be no

reforming of distant lands, let alone his own.<p>



	This much is clear: the Islamic revolution is caught in a dilemma. If it is to

deliver genuine solutions, it will have somehow to abandon the cynical pursuit

of power that has characterized Muslim politics for centuries. But if, instead,

in the pursuit of <i>ijtihad</i> and modern forms of justice, the revolution returns

to purer principles of Islam, it may find impossible standards there. That is

the lesson of Sudan. No one has yet shown that the modern Islamist creed is an

ideology suited to governing.<p>



	Foreign Islamists still travel to Khartoum for inspiration, but as they ponder

their struggles at home, the sight of what has happened in Sudan must occasion

in them a feeling of dread. As they, and we, watch the green flag of Islam

spread across the map, one thought should be uppermost: It is one thing to win

power, and quite another to wield it. <p>

	<font size=5>D</font>AYS from Djanet, in the wild and mountainous desert of southeastern Algeria,

the pickup blew a tire. A goat in the back lay down to die. My host, the

driver, was a young nomad with rings on his fingers. He hauled the goat to its

feet and then mounted the spare tire and said, "Don't worry. If you love a woman,

she can never hurt you. The desert is my woman." This alarmed me. I had another

metaphor in mind. A vehicle in the Sahara is a life raft, and ours had sprung a

leak: with the barest hiss the spare was losing air. We kept afloat only by

working an old bicycle pump. I remembered a Frenchman who had assured me, "You

are never alone in the desert." Easy to say in Paris, but I already knew of

people who had been too alone. You can lie for months here without being found.

Short of that, solitude is one of the beauties of the Sahara. Now we navigated

trackless valleys and sailed sand seas. We gave up on the goat, and abandoned

its carcass to the shade of thorns. And finally we got to Djanet, a lovely

oasis town at the foot of craggy cliffs. I have since become more objective,

but at the time, I thought it was the most luxurious place on earth.<p>



	There are other Saharas, some too tame. In Tunisia mass tourism has made a

caricature of the desert and turned young men into pimps. I once joined a group

of Spaniards there, and saw the land fast from behind glass. Our guide grappled

with the age-old problem of what to do with a desert. He named rock

formations -- the "lion," the "camel," the "cathedral." He sold dunes and

traditions. He used superlatives without content. "At Tamerza is the most

interesting waterfall. You absolutely must see it -- everyone does." The

waterfall was unusual, perhaps. Also liquid and cool. We splashed in it and

took pictures. The guide was a jester, ambiguous in the way of paid companions:

he seemed to disdain other Tunisians, and secretly to despise us as well. He

wanted us to admire the mirages, but there are mirages in Spain, too. The

Spaniards felt excluded and unfulfilled. This was Tunisia, the impenetrable

Sahara. Morocco is worse.  <p>



	Algeria is better, maybe because thirty years ago the Algerians threw the

French out. Algerians have become proud and somewhat distant. If they are poor,

they are not hungry. If they hustle each other, they do not bother strangers.

In the vast south, which is the desert, they themselves are accustomed to

travel. They are hospitable but not fawning. They appreciate their own solitude

and respect that of others. They have not spoiled their desert: it is the real

Sahara. Still, I cannot recommend a vacation there without admitting that

Algeria is troubled. After the near victory of the Islamic party in national

elections, and a subsequent military crackdown, last year a low-grade civil war

broke out that so far has claimed more than a thousand lives. The struggle is

limited to the north, mostly to savagery between authorities and rebels in the

capital, Algiers. To date foreigners have not been attacked.<p>



	In fact the capital is worth a few nights on the way to the Sahara. It

sparkles across hills on a blue Mediterranean bay. Though the suburbs boast a

Hilton and a Sofitel, the best place to stay is the Es-Safir (phone

011-213-273-5040, fax 273-7863), a venerable colonial-era hotel in the city

center, where for $40 you get a room with a high ceiling and a bath. Forget the

museums and the beaches. Algiers is tense and watchful. The economy has gone

underground. Walk the streets and study the face of resurgent Islam. You

probably should stay out of the casbah this year. The calls to prayer sound

like calls to action.<p>



	But you can also skip the city center, and fly Air Algerie from Algiers to

Djanet, two hours away by Boeing on a flight any day but Tuesday. The airline

is competent and safe. Except during the height of summer it runs an additional

weekly flight directly from Paris to Djanet. The flight takes only four hours,

but by some measures covers as great a distance as exists anywhere.<p>



<font size=5>D</font>JANET stands at 3,600 feet at the base of the Tassili-n-Ajjer plateau, which

rises almost twice as high. It is an old trading center for Tuareg nomads, the

veiled warriors of the high desert. Because of its altitude, the area is not

prohibitively hot, even in the summer, and nights are cold in the winter. The

town is home to 10,000 people. It consists of villages built of stone which

melt into the hillsides along a dry riverbed. It has an old French fort, a

market, and a typical date palmery. You can easily spend a couple of days

there, watching the Arabs, Tuaregs, and black Africans. Along the main street a

shaded cafe serves tea and good strong coffee. The little restaurants won't

make you sick. As elsewhere in the Sahara, the drinking water is clean.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the main hotel, a concrete box

longingly named The Z&eacute;ribas, after the airy stick-walled huts of

tradition. Better to stay six miles out of town at the other hotel, called

T&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; Villages, where a room for two costs $60 and

includes breakfast.<p>



	The hotel is run by T&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; Voyages, the most reputable

guide service in the Algerian Sahara. This is convenient, because Djanet alone

is not enough to see -- you'll want to poke around the desert. For $90 a day per

person ($50 for children) T&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; Voyages includes the

room, all meals, and a Toyota Landcruiser with driver. The price is based on

there being four passengers per vehicle, and is the same whether you make day

trips from the hotel or venture farther, camping in the desert. You may also

travel by camel or by foot with pack mule. Though all this quickly becomes

expensive, straying from Djanet without a guide and a good vehicle would be

foolish. T&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; Voyages says it has never lost a client.

Its phone number in Djanet is 011-213-9735053; its head office is in Ouargla,

at 970-7562, fax 970-2936.<p>



	Language is not a great obstacle. French is widely spoken, along with Arabic

and Tamachek, the Berber dialect of the Tuaregs. English is less common,

because American and British visitors are rare. But visitors talk too much

anyway, and expect too much of their guides. Local people know less than they

pretend to. You can learn more by reading a few books beforehand (if you read

French, you'll want to look for the <i>Guide Bled Algerie</i>, which is far and away

the best guidebook available; in English look for the out-of-print <i>Search for

the Tassili Frescoes</i>, by Henri Lhote), and trusting the guides simply to

navigate. In Algeria at least they don't require you to ski the dunes and they

don't name the rocks.<p>



	After a morning's drive south from Djanet you come to a desert of scattered

acacias, and to a canyon and a spring where nomads camp. The women may slip

into their tents. The men may make tea, and sit with you for hours in silence

and the buzzing of flies. The goats will bleat. The children will stare.<p>



	Farther to the south and east, after a day or so of hard travel, the Sahara

descends toward Niger and Libya into valleys so hot that the wind blows upward

and sand dunes mount the canyon walls to escape. Nomads do not venture here.

This is the Tadart, a wilderness within a wilderness, a desert of sculpted

stone. It requires patience to visit: at midday you pass long hours sheltering

from the sun under overhanging rocks; at night, under the brilliant stars, you

must reassure yourself that elsewhere life continues. I have tried, and been

unable, in the Tadart to imagine Manhattan.<p>



	Closer to Djanet lies Erg Admer, a sea of 300-foot dunes extending for more

than a hundred miles toward the Hoggar Mountains. By Algerian standards Admer

is a small erg, but its sand will line your horizons and fill your shoes. For

all its size, the most surprising characteristic of the Sahara is the speed

with which it changes. It is full of hidden worlds. The most compelling of them

rises to the east, in the rugged Tassili plateau. Accessible only by steep

cliffside trails, the Tassili contains one of the world's great collections of

prehistoric rock art. Rock drawings can be found in highlands throughout the

Sahara, hundreds in the Tadart alone, but only here in the Tassili is there

such a concentration-- perhaps 400,000 Neolithic paintings and engravings,

which together chronicle the human history of the Sahara. If you are physically

tough, you can hike up to the closest site and back in a day. It's better to

pack in supplies and spend a week. The richest site is at Sefar, a two-day walk

from the trailhead. And the Tassili is spectacular canyon-cut country. The art

gives you an excuse to wander through it.<p>



<p>



PEOPLE began to paint the rock there about 8,000 years ago, during a long wet

spell. They drew gods with round heads, and illustrated a Savannah roamed by

the largest African mammals. Rivers flowed in the canyons, and crocodiles

lurked, and there was good fishing near Djanet. Around 4000 B.C. new people

arrived with domesticated cattle, bringing with them the finest period in

Saharan art, the so-called Bovine: they drew realistic cows and graceful human

beings. Because of similarities of hairstyle and village life, clearly shown on

rock paintings, it seems likely that they were the ancestors of the modern

Peul, herders of the Sahel. Speculation that they wrecked their homeland by

overgrazing it seems unfair, since larger climatic forces were at work. After

2000 B.C. the desert began to return. The rivers dried up, and the African

mammals drifted south. On a cliffside near Djanet an engraving shows a weeping

cow. Around 1500 B.C. armed horsemen appeared, driving chariots at full gallop.

They were Berbers from the north, and they took over. The art declined, and the

desert deepened. Then, just before Christ, came the camel.<p>



	It came from Arabia as a domesticated animal, and soon supplanted the horse

and chariot. Fierce horsemen became even fiercer camelmen, the indomitable

Tuaregs. This is not as improbable as it might seem. Horses don't endure the

hard desert, and wheels require roads. In a brilliant book titled <i>The Camel and

the Wheel</i> (1990), the Columbia history professor Richard W. Bulliet describes

how camels came to dominate throughout North Africa and the Middle East. All

that was required was an efficient camel saddle -- and one was invented in

northern Arabia a few centuries before Christ. It was excellent as both a

packsaddle and a riding saddle. Afterward even the memory of the wheel was

lost.<p>



	Incidentally, the problem with camels is the hump, which is made of fat and

cannot support a load. The first saddles went on behind the hump, since there

was not enough space in front. But the rear was weak and wobbly. The

northern-Arabian solution was a saddle that straddled the hump with a frame of

inverted Vs. It allowed the camel to carry heavier packs, and it provided the

rider with a high, stable perch from which to swing a sword. According to

Bulliet, this was the invention that won the Arab world. It remains the

packsaddle of the Sahara today.<p>



	The rock art continues. The most recent works are primitive representations of

trucks and Junkers trimotors. The Tuaregs know that the hoof has been

surpassed. Still, they cling to their camels. For riding and making war, they

have gone beyond the Arabs. They breed a tall, thin camel with a back so long

that they can put their riding saddles <i>before</i> the hump. This places the rider

low, within the upper reach of a horseman, but improves the handling. Tuaregs

nestle their bare feet against their camels' necks and direct the beasts with

gentle pressure. If you go to Djanet, you might do the same, for the sake of

history alone. <p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE Sahara is a desert so vast that no airplane can 

diminish it. Certainly this one couldn't. I sat behind the pilots in the cockpit of an Air Algeria

turboprop lumbering at 18,000 feet across southern Algeria. The airplane was a

Dutch-built Fokker 27, a stodgy forty-passenger twin, doing 220 miles an hour;

it had come from the capital city, Algiers, on a roundabout three-day run to

the oases. Now we were bound for Adrar, an oasis remarkable even here for heat

and lack of rain. It was midday, midsummer. Outside the Sahara stretch in naked

folds to the horizon, brilliant and utterly still. It was blanketed by a haze

of dust, suspended not by winds but by heat. The only sign of people was a

trace of smoke rising in the distance. Below us a canyon cut through the

downslope of the Hoggar Mountains. To the south lay the Tanezrouft, a plain so

barren that drivers in the open desert mistake stones for diesel trucks, and so

lonely that, it is said, migrating birds land beside people just for the

company.<p>



The captain wore a white shirt with epaulets. He had pasty skin and the look of

an experienced pilot  --  bored, dissatisfied, underexercised. He flew with sloppy

control motions, like someone enduring a machine that he does not like. For him

this was a tough assignment. He was from Algiers, which is on the coast, and

had not had time to acclimatize. He must have suffered at night in the oasis

hotels.<p>



For me the flight was a luxury. I leaned over the ventilator and enjoyed the

coolness, knowing it wouldn't last. We had come to a road called the

Trans-Saharan, a faint scar running north-south across the desert. It was a route I had traveled by bus and

truck. Maps show it in bold ink, like an established highway, but much of the

pavement is broken and unusable. Across the center of the Sahara it dissolves

into bands of braided tracks. Drivers get lost, and each year some die of

thirst.<p>



"There is nothing out here," the captain complained. He spoke French, which is

the second language of the Sahara, after Arabic.<p>



I thought, <i>Nothing here</i>? But this is the Trans-Saharan, the route of dreams, a

way across the desert! On earlier trips I had felt every mile of it. I

remembered one ride on a truck, in a passenger box thick with heat, bodies, and

dust. We laughed when the first bump threw us from the benches; the second bump

smashed us agains the ceiling, and suddenly it was no longer funny. For two

days we held on, waiting for the pounding to end. That was the worst. Elsewhere

in the Sahara I had felt other miles  --  by foot, communal taxi, cargo truck,

moped, even river steamer.  I had come to the Sahara as others might travel to

the Himalayas, to see the world in its extreme. There is no other place as hot

and dry and empty. There are few places as hostile to life. Yet it is lived

in.<p>



	The captain was disgusted by the place. He said, "You let a sheet of paper

fall and it takes forever to hit the ground. It's the heat." He tried to be

polite. He asked me about the condition of the road. He asked me where I had

been and where I was going, and why. He knew I was a writer, and also a pilot,

and this made him doubly distrustful. Why would a pilot travel so much by

ground? And what was there to say about such emptiness? I tried to explain. He

seemed worried about me.<p>



I worry too. The problem is not how little there is to say but how 

much  --  not how empty the Sahara is but how complex. Geographers still disagree about the

most basic terms. For instance, if "desert" is defined by dryness, should the

pluviometric threshold be six inches of rain a year or twice as much? Should

"desert" be defined by variability of rainfall? By rates of evaporation? By

hours of sunshine? Or should we choose a human standard and define deserts as

places we can neither plant nor settle without irrigation?<p>



	Underlying these choices is the question of whether isometric lines drawn on a

map can ever encompass the real thing. Describe the Sahara? We can't even

measure it. Keeping this in mind, here are a few facts:<p>



<ul>

<li> The Sahara is the world's largest desert, about the size of the United States

including Alaska. It fills the northern third of Africa, stretching 3,100 miles

from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. In the north it is bounded by the Atlas

Mountains and the Mediterranean. In the south it encounters no geographic

barrier. There it has expanded into the populated grasslands of the Sahel,

uprooting millions of people, throwing them against one another, and spawning

wars. Expansion, which is apparently the result of long-term climatic changes,

accelerated by overpopulation, overgrazing, and deforestation, is neither

uniform nor ineluctable. There are years even now when rainfall and vegetation

push the desert back. From north to south the Sahara is at present about 1,200

miles deep.<p>



<li> There are two central mountain ranges. The Hoggar Mountains, of southern

Algeria, climb to 9,852 feet, and the Tibesti, of northern Chad, culminate at

11,204 feet, the highest point in the desert. The rest of the Sahara is flat,

made up of plateaus and low hills covered mostly by gravel and rock. Only a

fifth of it is sand, formed into dune seas known as ergs. One fifth is still a

lot of territory. The Libyan erg alone is the size of France.<p>



<li> The Sahara is geologically ancient. Its basement is gently arching granite,

dating back five billion years to the beginning of geologic history. As the

continents drifted and the global climate shifted, northern Africa became

ocean, forest, lake, swamp, desert, and ocean again. A series of inundations

over millions of years laid down the sedimentary plains visible today. The

rocks hold mineral riches: oil and natural gas in the north, uranium in the

south, iron and phosphate in the west. For the desert people, the most

important discoveries have been the vast aquifers in the north.<p>



<li> Unlike deserts caused by features of topography, the Sahara is a weather

desert, caused by the flow and physics of the atmosphere. Imagine it as a

solar-powered air pump. The thermal equator, a line connecting the hottest

points on the globe, runs through Africa ten to twenty degrees north of the

geographic equator -- in other words, just south of the Sahara. As air is heated

along this line, it rises. As it rises, it cools, and forms rainstorms. These

storms define the southern limit of the desert. Meanwhile, at the surface the

rising air sucks in dense Saharan winds from the north. These winds in turn are

replenished by the air directly overhead. Since the sinking air contains

virtually no moisture, northern Africa is a desert. The weather is a closed

loop, completed far above the surface by southerly winds.<p>



<li> Evaporation rates in the Sahara are the highest in the world. The relative

humidity averages 30 percent, and it has been recorded as low as 2.5 percent.

If you measure dryness by the net yearly amount of radiant heat at the surface

versus the amount of heat that would be necessary to evaporate the annual

rainfall -- the so-called dryness ratio -- the excess evaporative power of the

Sahara ranges from a factor of ten to infinity. The ratio is high partly

because there is so little rain. Most of the Sahara receives less than three

inches a yean (New York's annual rainfall is forty-three inches.) Even the

wettest areas, along the outer edges, suffer from unreliability: it may rain

today and next week, and then not again for years. There are large areas where

nothing grows. At the center of the Sahara are 800,000 square miles of hyperarid plateaus, some of which

have been practically sterilized by drought. In such places bacteria die

quickly, and cadavers, partly mummified, decompose slowly. Think of sundried

apricots.<p>





<li>In the open desert the most successful animals are human beings. The most

common are mice, ants, and flies. There are also jackals, bats, lizards,

vipers, long-legged spiders, and scorpions. Butterflies and birds fly long

distances across the worst terrain. Antelopes, mountain sheep, ostriches, and

foxes, once widespread, have fallen to the repeating rifle and the all-terrain vehicle. Of the large Saharan

mammals only gazelles remain, and they, too, are being hunted into oblivion.

Camels do not exist in a wild state. They may roam at large, but they are bred

and branded. Camels are valuable, because they endure in the desert almost as

well as Toyotas.<p>

<font size=5>O</font>F the twenty passengers aboard the Air Algeria Fokker only one was a woman,

and she was veiled. She sat stiffly, not daring to look outside, while her

children wandered the aisle. The men seated near her wore white robes and

turbans. They were Arabized Berbers and Berberized blacks -- traders, students,

soldiers on leave. Some had the beards of the Islamic revival. In the back sat

four Tuaregs, lanky, fine-featured nomads of the central Sahara. They smelled

of woodsmoke, and wore <i>chchs</i>, long cotton strips wrapped around the head and

forward across the nose and mouth. The <i>chch</i> is more than an answer to sun and

dust; it masks the wearer and gives him the power of anonymity. The Tuareg are

renowned warriors. They fought off the French into this century. Now, across

the Tanezrouft, in Mali and Niger they have risen again in rebellion against

the central governments.<p>



The Tuareg are Berbers too, like most people in the Sahara. "Berber" is a

broad descriptive term that includes a wide range of groups descended from

Eurasian horsemen who arrived 3,000 years ago. It derives from 

<i>barbarus</i>, Latin

for "foreign and uncivilized," and, unintentionally, it still expresses a

common attitude toward North Africans. Saharans are also called Arabs, which

might be a more polite label. The Arabs are if anything overcivilized. Their

armies came to the northern Sahara in the seventh century A.D. Though the

armies didn't stay long, Arabs interbred with the Berbers, and imported a

language, a culture, and a new religion -- Islam. Over the following centuries

this potent Arab combination spread south, gradually weakening and replacing

the Berber traditions. Today, although there may yet exist in the Sahara some

"pure" Arabs, and there are a good many pure Berbers, the majority of the

Sahara's population represents a mixture to some degree.<p>



The Sahara is an Islamic desert, but this does not mean that it is a unified

desert. Throughout the Sahara you hear the refrain "Our Islam is the true

Islam," implying that the neighbors' is not. The neighborhood consists of ten

sometimes unfriendly nations. Recent events in the Persian Gulf have heightened

their differences. As you might suspect by looking at a map, the borders

between them are arbitrary. They were drawn to meet the needs of colonial

administration, and they remain wild and unmarked. Nonetheless, when you cross

one, what is surprising is not how little the desert changes but how much the

context does.<p>



	In the south are four landlocked countries -- Mali, Niger, Chad, and Sudan.

These are miserable places, bearing the brunt of the desert's expansion and

plagued by civil wars. Along the coastline are the five countries of the

Mahgreb: Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. None is happy.

Mauritania is brutal and xenophobic; Morocco suffers under a reactionary king;

Algeria and Tunisia are politically and economically bankrupt; Libya, the only

wholly Saharan nation, has been cursed with Muammar Qaddafi. Egypt, to the

east, along the Nile, is a riverine society with problems too intricate and

particular to summarize here.<p>



Throughout the Sahara a sense of change is in the air.  Socialism, liberalism,

and military rule have failed. Pan-Arabism has proved to be an empty promise.

But over the past few years a potent ideology has resurfaced -- Islamic

fundamentalism. Islam is a religion that provides for both law and government.

Ever since the Iranian revolution it has taken on new relevance, as an

alternative to the models of the West, as a homegrown answer to disorder,

corruption, and inequality. The large, vigorous fundamentalist movement has

become the dominant political factor in the Sahara.<p>



North African fundamentalists are Sunni Muslims, less frantic than the Shiites

of Lebanon and Iran. No one knows what will result if they take over. Will

there be more Irans --  radical, repressive, and hostile to the West? Or will

something new and more benign be created? In Algeria the Islamic party may

eventually seize power. An Islamic government there would have

profound -- perhaps revolutionary -- effects on the entire region.<p>





<font size=4><b>Water in Adrar</font></b><p>





<font size=5>A</font>drar is a provincial capital in central Algeria, a town 

of 15,000, laid out in

wide streets between ocher buildings. It sits at the center of a region of

oases known as the Touat, astride an ancient caravan route from Gao and

Timbuktu. I went there to look at irrigation. My host was a young merchant,

Moulay Lakhdar Miloud. Moulay is a title of respect. There are a lot of

Moulays, and many seem to know one another. I once heard the Sahara described

as the United States of Moulay.<p>



Moulay Miloud is a bachelor with a narrow, intelligent face and a moustache.

His friends call him Uncle Moulay. He was dressed in a pressed white robe. We

sat on the floor of his living room and waited out the hot midday hours,

drinking brown water from a plastic jug. The water was brown because Miloud had

mixed in cade oil. The cade is an evergreen bush that grows in the Atlas

Mountains. Saharan nomads use its oil to seal the inside of goatskin water

bags. Miloud did not have a goatskin, but he came from a long line of desert

travelers. He bought the oil in small bottles and added it to his water for

flavor and good health. The mixture smelled of pine sap and tasted of clay.

Miloud smiled, pleased that I liked it. But I would have drunk anything. I had

been for a walk.<p>



"It's raining less," Miloud said. "And every year it's hotter. Nomads can no

longer survive this climate. "<p>



I believed him.<p>



The house, like Miloud, was small and immaculate. It had a fan and an

evaporative cooler. The living room was furnished Saharan style, with

mattresses, pillows, and colorful rugs. Black-and-white enlargements of nomads

hung on the stucco walls. A guitar stood in the corner. <i>The Cosby 

Show</i>, which

is broadcast by national television, flickered soundlessly on a TV screen. A

stereo played screechy Saharan music. In the hallway, by a portrait of Bob

Marley, was a postcard of three naked women. They were grotesquely fat. Miloud

said, "In the summer even the mind shuts down. You get tired of television,

music, and books. There is no stimulation. There is little to say. You are too

much indoors."<p>



For good reason. Outdoors the temperature was 124 degrees Fahrenheit. During my

walk the air had been still, the sky milky with dust. There was no shade. The

streets were deserted. The heat hit hard, a physical assault, burning skin,

eyes, and lungs. I felt threatened and disoriented. I had drunk my fill

beforehand, but an hour without water was all I could stand.<p>



The Sahara is hot because it is sunny. In Adrar out of some 4,400 hours of

annual daylight there are 3,978 hours of direct sun, on average. (Paris, home

of the great Saharan colonizers, gets 1,728 hours of sun.) Elsewhere in the

desert the count is equally high. And this is steep-angle sunlight, powerful

stuff. In the winter, air temperatures can drop to freezing at night and rise

to 90 degrees by noon; soil temperatures can fluctuate so brutally that rocks

split, a process called insolation weathering. In the summer the Sahara is the

hottest place on earth. The record, 136 degrees. Fahrenheit, is held by al Azizia,

Libya. Airborne dust makes things worse. It traps heat radiated by the hot

soil, and is why in Adrar the desert does not cool much on summer nights.<p>



Late in the afternoon Miloud and I drove an old Renault to one of the outlying

oases. The road was paved. It led past neglected palm groves and then across

rolling sand and dirt. In the far distance I could make out the dunes of the

Erg Chech, the enormous and uninhabited sand sea that extends 600 miles, across

Mali and into Mauritania. Miloud said, of the land on either side of the road,

"In the winter all this is green." Translation: if it rains, a few translucent

grasses may sprout. The average annual rainfall in Adrar is less than an

inch.<p>



The two dozen oases of the Touat sit at the receiving end of the largest dry

watercourse in the Sahara, an ancient riverbed called the Messaoud. It is a

long, shallow depression where water still lies close underground. Oases are

not the waterholes of public imagination but irrigated groves of date palms.

They are artificial creations. The ones in the Touat are famous for the

engineering of their traditional wells. Known as <i>foggaras</i>, these are gently

sloping tunnels, burrowed for miles into higher terrain. Since their paths are

marked by frequent mounds around excavation shafts, they look like the diggings

of giant moles. The <i>foggaras</i> were built centuries ago, not to find water but to

bring it to the oases in a constant flow. They are self-filling subterranean

aqueducts. They are not, however, self-maintaining.<p>



Our destination appeared as a green line against the dusty sky. The line

became a palm grove and an ancient fortified village, or <i>tsar</i>, of about a

thousand people. In searing heat we walked through the streets -- a warren of

baked mud and dark, built-over passages just wide enough for a loaded camel to

pass. There were no camels now, only a few sad donkeys hauling firewood. The

inhabitants were Haratin blacks, descendants of slaves, who still occupy the

lowest level of Saharan society. Racism exists throughout the desert, though it

is tempered somewhat by the egalitarian precepts of Islam. I do not mean to

suggest that modern Islam has brought enlightenment to the Sahara.

Fundamentalism never seems to promote understanding. But Saharan society is

noticeably different from ours in the way it is softened by the vitality ot its

religion.<p>



A band of dusty children followed us into the desert to the <i>foggaras</i>. Water

was still flowing, but the <i>foggaras</i> were slipping into disrepair. One reason is

that maintaining them -- digging them out, shoring them up -- is dangerous and

difficult work, and since the abolition of slavery there has been no ready

supply of labor. A more immediate reason was in the concrete shelter nearby. It

housed an electric pump, drawing water from a bored well. The modern world had

arrived, and no one was complaining.<p>



The system of distribution was still the traditional one. We followed the

ditches that carried the water back to the village. Upstream it was drawn for

drinking; downstream it was used for washing and sewage. The water that finally

flowed toward the palm grove was, let's say, rich in nutrients. It was also

precious. Water rights are inherited, bought, and sold, and are more valuable

than the land itself. Within the grove the water is divided and metered through

finger-width gateways into an intricate branching of channels. In the end it

spreads into individual plots, separated by dikes and protected against wind

and sand by adobe walls. There the date palms grow.<p>



Date palms are well adapted to the Sahara. They thrive on sun and heat, and

will produce fruit in water that is ten times as salty as human beings should

drink. Though they require large amounts of irrigation for the first few years,

they then tap into groundwater and become self-supporting. They also shade the

irrigated vegetable crops -- most commonly corn and tomatoes.<p>



This grove was small by Algerian standards -- about a half square mile of

junglelike vegetation. We strolled through it on dirt paths between the plots.

The shade was dense, but it provided no relief from the heat. Dead fronds

drooped from the trees and littered the ground. Miloud pointed to them and said

that when he was young, the farmers would have been ashamed. Yellow butterflies

flitted about. Ants carried oversized trophies. A turbaned man hacked at the

earth. A ditch gurgled with polluted water. I stopped to list the other sounds:

the distant music of Arab horns, a dove cooing, a donkey braying, a cricket,

birds trilling, children laughing, the thunk of a woodchopper, a sharper

hammering, a rooster crowing, flies buzzing, a chanted prayer.<p>



<font size=5>E</font>ARLY one morning Miloud and I drank coffee at a cafe. The conversation turned,

as it often does with young Saharans, to religion. I listened and tried to

understand. But when Miloud mentioned his hatred for Jews, I answered back. I

said that he was mythologizing them. I said that even if, as an Arab, he

resented Israel, he had to distinguish Jews from Israel. I said that he even

had to distinguish Israelis from one another. He retreated to history and

talked of what he called ancient crimes -- the Jews' unwillingness to accept the

new word of God and his Prophet. Muslims have a strictly chronological view of

progress: their faith rests in the idea that Mohammed was the final prophet,

and that his message supersedes all others. I asked Miloud how he could hold

individuals responsible today for the deeds of their distant ancestors. I said,

What if I were a Jew? He answered, But you are not. He was unbending, and our

arguments became circular.<p>



I remembered a conversation with a policeman in another oasis. He said, "The

French? Oh, yes, we fought a war; we hate them."<p>



I asked, "What about the Russians?" The oasis had a military base and a small

contingent of Soviet advisers.<p>



"They are godless. We hate them, too."<p>



"And the Germans?"<p>



"They are fascists. We hate them."<p>



"And Americans?"<p>



"Oh, no, Algerians do not hate Americans." He hesitated. "Except for

imperialists and Jews -- we hate them most of all."<p>



Since there are few Jews remaining in the Sahara, the anti-Semitism there has

become somewhat academic. It is disquieting nonetheless. I have friends in the

northern Sahara whose daughter is a bright, charming schoolgirl, a picture of

sweet innocence. Once when I was over for dinner, she smiled and said, "If an

Israeli ever came here, I would . . ."<p>



"What would you do?" her mother asked gently.<p>



"I would kill him."<p>



The television news had been filled with brutal home videos of the 

<i>Intifada</i>,

the Palestinian uprising. They have become a staple of Islamic solidarity.<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HERE is a limit to the insulating qualities of adobe construction, a

temperature extreme beyond which walls go critical and begin to magnify the

heat. I have studied this: the walls do not cool down at night; at dawn the

inside surfaces are hot to the touch; by day they are hotter still. The houses

become solar ovens. Concrete is worse: it gets hotter in sunlight and no less

hot after dark. In the big Soviet-style buildings you can burn bare feet on the

second floor. Air-conditioners and evaporative coolers are rare, and

replacement parts are rarer.<p>



During the peak months of summer people move outdoors. In the morning and late

afternoon they sit in the shade cast by the walls. At midday they hide as best

they can, under an awning or a tree. Strangers flock to the hotels, where the

lobbies have fans and high ceilings. The secret police flock there too, for the

same reasons, and also to investigate the strangers. Everyone waits. At night,

while hotel guests lie trapped in their rooms, the Saharans eat and sleep in

the gardens.<p>



Miloud and I went to dinner in Adrar at the house of Nouari, a bookish

construction engineer. He had also invited a tall, shy hydrologist, who the

next day was to guide me through a modern irrigated farm north of town. The

four of us sat on carpets in the sand behind the house.<p>



It was a sweltering night, the temperature still over 100 degrees The stars were

blackened by dust. The meal was lit by kerosene lanterns on a barrel. Nouari's

wife and mother cooked for us but did not appear.  Sexual apartheid reigns in

much of the Sahara, and pudency demands that women stay hidden from male

guests. I made no mention of the women. Nouari poured water from a pitcher and

we washed our hands.<p>



We started with raw milk and dates. Nouari said, "The Prophet recommended

dates."<p>



Miloud added, "Milk and dates make a complete meal. They are all a person

needs to eat."<p>



Nonetheless, we also had tripe, couscous, and melon. Afterward we drank tea

brewed by Nouari on a butane burner, and the discussion returned to dates.<p>



Dates are so important that oases are measured by the size of their groves.

The largest have more than a million trees; the smallest have a thousand. After

the Algerian war of independence against the French, which ended in 1962, the

groves were nationalized by the socialist regime. Later they were privatized,

returned to the original owners, but they have not recovered their earlier

glory. The inhabitants of the oases are crazy about their dates. They eat them

directly off the branch; they dry them and eat them; they bake, boil, and fry

them and eat them. They are date gourmets, and can distinguish hundreds of

varieties by taste, texture, and color. They know date facts: that a thousand

dates grow in a single cluster, that half the weight of a dried date is sugar,

and that dates are rich in minerals and vitamins. Nouari listed them, taking

care that I note every one: "Vitamins A, B, C, D, E."<p>



The hydrologist added, "Dates help against cancer. Research is being done in

the United States at a big university."<p>



Nouari described the yearly pollination performed by the farmers. He recited

the line from the Koran that is read while this is done: "In the name of God,

mild and merciful. "<p>



Miloud observed that the tree itself is a wonderful resource. With help from

the others, he went through all the uses of it. They are too many to list here,

but they can be summarized as follows: things that can be done with wood and

palm fronds. The hydrologist finished by saying, "The Prophet loved the tree

too." It is not surprising that the neglect of the groves in the Sahara has

added fuel to the fire of Islamic revolt.<p>





<font size=5>T</font>HE hydrologist's name was Sollah. In the morning he took me to see the

irrigated farm, which he called a model. It sprawled across 800 unshaded acres

in virgin desert -- an American-style operation, privately owned, with a bright

tractor and a crew of Haratin black workers. Circular irrigation systems stood

over wheat stubble. There were greenhouses, and plots of tomatoes, peppers,

pimientos, cucumbers, melons, and cantaloupes. There was plenty of mud. This

was modern agriculture -- energetic, productive, and perhaps wasteful. I told

Sollah that it looked like farms in California. He was pleased, and asked why.

I answered, Cheap water. This pleased him even more, because it was his water.

He had directed the government crew that drilled the first well.<p>



	We went to drink the results. Two pumps drove a heavy flow of water into a

holding tank. The water was sweet and cool. They had struck it with an

Oklahoman rig at a depth of 450 feet. The water ran dirty with sand and mud for

two days, and afterward turned clear. The project took a month to complete,

which is about average. There are several crews like Sollah's in the province.

Together they have been drilling forty-five wells a year.  Every well has

produced.<p>



	Most of the Sahara is too dry for drilling. If you do hit water, either there

is too little or it is too salty or too expensive to pump out. It might sustain

a few settlers, or people passing through. It is not worth thc cost of getting

to it. But here, in the northern third of the desert, large reserves of fresh

water lie under the parched surface. The shallowest have for centuries

irrigated the towns and oases. They can be got at by foggaras and hand-dug wells.

They are susceptible to drought and overuse; the water table falls, crops fail,

and settlements must be abandoned. But if it rains, even far away, eventually

the shallow reserves are replenished.<p>



	Of greater importance for the future are the deep aquifers, whose discovery

was a by-product of the search for oil. The mere knowledge of their existence

has had a profound effect on life in the Sahara. Known as confined aquifers,

they are pools of fresh water trapped in permeable rock strata at depths of 300

to 6,000 feet. They hold as much water, according to one estimate, as the

Amazon River discharges in two years. That is a lot of water. What's better,

much of it is under pressure. Once tapped, it rises to the surface and forms

artesian wells. Geysers have shot hundreds of feet into the air. Wells have

been capped to keep villages from flooding.<p>



	Water works powerfully on the souls of Saharans. Muammar Qaddafi has launched

an agricultural revolution in Libya, and is building gigantic irrigation

projects. He believes he will transform his sands. If for nothing else, he is

respected for this. Other Saharans have equally grandiose dreams. Miles of

tomatoes, potatoes, rice paddies, fish farms, horizons of grain -- the United

States of Moulay. If there is water in the desert, anything is possible.

Sollah, a quiet and rational man, was suffused with the glory of his mission.

Even the taxi driver who took us out to the farm had an opinion. He believed

that irrigation would eventually bring rain. Call it reverse desertification,

the trickle-up theory.<p>



	But there is a problem. The deep aquifers are being recharged very slowly, if

at all. This means that the aquifers contain mostly fossil water, deposited

long ago, when the Sahara was not a desert. The water that Sollah and I were

drinking was perhaps 5,000 years old. In western Egypt well water may be five

or ten times as old. My comparison to California was only partly correct. Much

of the irrigation water in the American desert comas from rivers and

reservoirs -- short-term, renewable surface supplies. Some waste is perhaps

affordable. The deep water of the Sahara is different: you pump it here for

keeps. Like oil, it is not renewable.<p>



	A second problem is that despite the large reserves, only a small fraction of

the stored water can be extracted economically. There are many reasons for

this, including lowering tables, loss of artesian pressure, expense of

drilling, expense of pumping, and increasing salinity. Scientists argue that

new wells should be drilled sparingly, and water used wisely. They use terms

like "practical sustained yield" -- meaning you take out no more than is going

in. They say an aquifer is like a bank account -- if you must draw it down, the

reason should be to build a return in the long run. They warn about unchecked

exploitation, and talk about the end's coming as soon as 2025.<p>



	Their advice passes like wind. Saharans are no wiser than the rest of us. They

dream of green. It is the color of Islam. In Algeria the fundamentalists have

promised to make a garden of the desert. Words come easily.<p>







<font size=4><b>Life in Tamanrasset</b></font><p>





<font size=5>A</font>lgerians called it the extreme south, with the same feeling

 that we put into our

"Far West." It is the land of more so: drier, fiercer, and wilder, a desert of

parched basins and volcanic mountains, of buttes, cinder cones, and confused

black rock. You can walk for hours absorbed by the drama of desolation and

distance. The view is mesmerizing, like a night sky. The peaks give it depth;

the nomads give it scale. It is the central Sahara, a long way to everywhere.

Then you turn around and find Tamanrasset.<p>



	There are no date groves in Tamanrasset, and few trees. Perched nearly a mile

high in the Hoggar Mountains, it is the boomtown of the Sahara. Northerners

criticize it as an austere place, where Islam is practiced strictly, alcohol is

forbidden, and Arab women, even veiled, rarely venture onto the streets. There

is no telephone connection, no good road, and no decent postal service -- only a

downlink for national television. Groundwater is so limited that new households

are not allowed to hook up to the municipal system and old households are

severely rationed. People live on deliveries from private water trucks that

scavenge supplies from distant wells. Despite plans to pipe in water hundreds

of miles from the south, no one expects the situation to improve. The town is

growing too fast. Over the past decade its population has swollen to 45,000,

mostly with northerners seeking their fortune on the frontier.<p>



	The reason is trade. Tamanrasset sits at the geographic heart of the desert.

Linked to the north by 1,200 mostly paved miles of the Trans-Saharan Highway,

it dominates a network of dirt tracks stretching into Mali, Niger, and Libya.

The trading works by barter: Algerian food is transported from the north and

exchanged for new and used consumer goods that come in from the uncontrolled

economies to the south. It is a difficult business, and much of it is illegal.

There are worries about border police and soldiers, breakdowns, banditry, and

death by thirst. Nonetheless, plenty of people are willing to take the risk. In

the Extreme South everything that moves comes through Tamanrasset.<p>



	The oldest building in town is a small adobe fort with crenellated walls which

looks like a set piece out of a Foreign Legion movie. It was built by Charles

de Foucauld, a French religious hermit who came here in 1905 to live among the

fearsome Tuareg. At the time, Tamanrasset was an encampment of twenty straw

huts. Foucauld, intending to found a monastery, chose it because of its

isolation and poverty. He was a bit of a nut, and drew no followers. During the

First World War various Saharan tribes revolted against the French, a faint

echo of the European struggle. Foucauld took sides and began sending reports to

the French colonial army. On the night of December 1, 1916, the rebels lured

him out of his stronghold, bound him hand and foot, and shot him in the head.<p>



	After the war the French built a larger fort across the way, and Foucauld

joined the French pantheon as a Catholic martyr in the cause of colonialism.

The Foucauld myth still accounts for much of the tourism in Tamanrasset. This

frustrates Algerians, who want the business but have an active memory.<p>



	Today the two forts are at the center of town and the main street passes

between them. The street is crooked, shaded, and lined with adobe buildings

stained ocher and set against a clear sky. Every evening, when the mountain air

turns cool, people meet there to stroll and to talk in the sidewalk cafes. Arab

and Berber businessmen make deals over sweet tea, pulling thick wads of cash

from under their gowns. Black women in colorful print dresses balance baskets

on their heads. Veiled Tuareg men ride by on camels. Barefaced Tuareg women

lead their lovely daughters down the sidewalks. Uniformed soldiers stroll in

twos and threes.<p>



The style of the street is not completely spontaneous.  Some time ago a German

architect was brought in on a five-year contract to spruce up the place.

Citizens now criticize his work. Particularly galling to them is a garish

administration building in mock-Saharan style, and a public square with cement

columns that cast no shade. The centerpiece of the square, in this town without

water, is a fountain. It has never been turned on, and is slowly filling with

garbage. To protect Tamanrasset from such mistakes in the future, an

architectural advisory committee has been formed. Its guiding light is a young

man named Salah Addoun. Tall and energetic, he has close-cropped black hair,

dark Berber skin, and a ready smile. At thirty-four, Addoun is one of the most

admired men of Tamanrasset.<p>



	He was raised in the desert, not far from Adrar. After six years of university

studies in structural engineering and architecture, he moved to Tamanrasset.

Now, while waiting for the licenses that will allow him to open the town's

first private architectural studio, he works for his uncle's construction firm.

His office is a concrete cubicle off an equipment yard -- a noisy, dusty,

crumbling room lit by a single bulb that hangs from the ceiling. Addoun

disdains luxury. He draws carefully on an inclined school desk, and is

interrupted by questions from the yard crew. He builds houses for the middle

class, shops for shopkeepers, and housing projects for the government. His

designs are spacious, cool, and well adapted to the Saharan culture. There are

separate quarters for men and women; he believes that the sexes must not be

forced to mix. Addoun is a strict traditionalist.<p>



	He is also a fundamentalist Muslim, and has recently become more devout.

Alienated by the corruption and incompetence of the political system, he has

turned to the Koran for solutions. In fact, he believes that the Koran contains

solutions to all the world's problems. Addoun is an intelligent and

well-educated man. His absolute faith is hard for a Westerner to understand.<p>



	One day, while brewing tea in the mountains, we talked about fate. He said,

"Two weeks ago my neighbor Boucenna went off with a driver down the

Trans-Saharan toward In-Guezzam. Halfway there they broke down -- it was the

carburetor.  The driver hitched a ride in a passing truck to fetch a part, and

he left Boucenna to guard the car. After a few hours Boucenna decided to leave

after all, and he set off on foot. He made it twenty kilometers before he

died."<p>



"He must have panicked," I said.<p>



	Addoun shook his head. "Boucenna was not a coward. And he was not stupid. But

for every man there are two times that are inescapable -- the time of birth and

the time of death. These are not places but times. Boucenna walked because his

time had come."<p>



I said, "You mean death is everyone's destination."<p>



"I mean there is a time, and it is predetermined."<p>



	We left it at that, unsatisfied. Even between friends some gaps are

unbridgeable.<p>



	In this confrontation between civilizations the Saharans have an advantage:

they know the West better than the West knows them. One window is France, the

historical colonial master and current destination for emigrant workers. The

other window is television, and it looks directly onto the United States. In

Tamanrasset there are shows about cowboys, gangsters, suburbanites, teenagers.

At a glance people can distinguish Los Angeles from New York, Texas from

Florida. By observing us from the outside, they learn more than we might

suspect.<p>



	Addoun and I spent an evening watching television in an open courtyard. A

movie was showing, dubbed in French. A beautiful actress lay on the beach. I

asked Addoun what he thought: was she a whore to exhibit herself?<p>



He laughed at me. "Why, because of the bathing suit?"<p>



"Your Islam will ban them."<p>



"For our women, not for yours."<p>



"What is the difference?"<p>



"The difference, my dear friend, is purely cultural."<p>



Later, perhaps to change the subject, he said, "You can tell an American movie

by the cars. "<p>



	I pointed to the screen. "That's a Volkswagen."<p>



	"It's how they shot the cars -- they advertise them. You wait, there'll be a car

chase. "<p>



There was.<p>



	He said, "In French movies they advertise food. There's always a scene where

they're eating dinner "<p>



	He thought for a while. "In Arab movies they show weddings."<p>



Addoun has not yet married. He wants to start his business first, and build a

proper house. His girlfriend lives elsewhere; she writes him regularly. He will

not tell me her name. When he does take a wife, his friends may never meet

her.<p>



<font size=5>B</font>Y Western standards women in the Sahara do not have easy lives. Once, in a

northern oasis, I met a modern-looking man in a business suit who ran a movie

theater that women were forbidden to enter. His name was Amar Hamim. That week

he was showing a cheap Hollywood movie. I forget the title and plot but

remember some bare breasts and love scenes, a theater full of men, and an

atmosphere thick with sexual tension.<p>



	This was in an oasis where the women who ventured onto the streets wrapped

themselves in white shrouds and allowed only a single eye to show. Hamim and I

were walking together when we passed one of them. At first she seemed like just

another shrouded figure -- as anonymous and uninteresting as she was meant to be.

But then we exchanged glances, she and I, and I discovered an eye of the most

exquisite beauty --  oval, almond colored, lightly made up, with long lashes. The

eye was warm, lively, and inviting. I didn't need to see more.<p>



	I nudged Hamim and asked if he had noticed. He smiled and said, "But she's

married -- that's why she veils herself. "<p>



"And your wife, does she wear a veil?"<p>



"Of course!" He was shocked that I had asked.<p>



	Later I pointed to an unveiled woman in a tailored suit. "Who is she?"<p>



"A whore."<p>



"You know her?"<p>



He shook his head.<p>



	"Maybe she works in an office." Women do, in the more liberal oases.<p>



	"She's a whore." He was emphatic.<p>



	It is difficult to understand how any woman could share this view, but many

seem to. The Islamic revival, which advocates strict separation of the sexes,

draws enthusiastic support from masses of young and educated women. Even in the

cities they have returned voluntarily to the veil. They cloister themselves,

and encourage their husbands and brothers to join the movement. They believe

that Islam represents the true emancipation of women, here on earth as well as

in heaven. They argue that it is the West that enslaves, with its moral decay

and sexual exploitation. No one knows if this is revolutionary zeal or a

sustainable attitude. There are other women who oppose the fundamentalists -- but

quietly. They are trapped for now. Some Western observers believe that they

will triumph in the end. They argue that sexual apartheid will prove to be the

weak link in Islamic government.  <p>



<font size=5>A</font>DDOUN and I went to lunch at the house of Moulay Lakhdar Abderhadim, one of the

most successful businessmen of Tamanrasset. He lived in a wealthy district, out

beyond the camel market. To the unaccustomed eye it was a dismal area. Chickens

and goats picked through garbage in the rutted dirt streets. There were long,

monotonous compound walls, crumbling and neglected, stained brown with mud and

blowing dust. Only the vehicles hinted at money: black Peugeots, Range Rovers,

and Land Cruisers, worth two to three times their price in the United States.<p>



	We knocked at a metal gate. After a delay, while the women scurried out of

sight, we were let in by an old black man in a robe and turban. Addoun greeted

him warmly and introduced him as a friend of the family, though clearly he was

a servant. We entered a lush garden of fruit trees and flowering bushes. The

house was sprawling, single-story, made of stone and adobe. Addoun knew his

way, and led me into the sitting room, where Abderhadim reclined on a mattress

watching a soccer game on television. Abderhadim is plump and soft, and has

thinning hair. He wore a blue running suit zippered up tight around his throat.

A blanket was draped over his legs; Abderhadim suffers from rheumatism, and it

had flared up in his knees. Addoun and I sat on cushions on the floor. The

doorway gave onto a courtyard, brilliant with desert light. Other men arrived.

The servant came with a bowl of couscous, and sat with us.<p>



	Abderhadim said he was a trader in food, car parts, and other goods, as the

opportunities arose. I asked him to explain. He said he was an importer by

default. "Niger is very poor. But you can find everything there." I asked if it

was difficult doing business across such distances, with no roads, no

telephones, and nonconvertible currencies. He smiled and said, "We are all

Muslims."<p>



	Another man, dressed in a white robe and turban, told a story to illustrate

the social contract in the Sahara: His uncle was a trader in Tamanrasset who

for years ran camel caravans to Niger and Mali, carrying dates and salt to the

south, and returning with chickens. His name was Salem Ben Hadj Ahmed. In 1953,

on the way to Agadez, Niger, he and his men came across the encampment of a

nomadic family. The father and older sons had gone off hunting, leaving the

mother and her youngese children. The woman made the caravaners welcome, gave

them water, and prepared to slaughter a sheep in their honor. But Ahmed stopped

her, since his men had killed a gazelle and had fresh meat. They ate the

gazelle, and in the morning moved on. It was Ahmed's last trip; he was getting

to be an old man. Afterward he stayed in Tamanrasset and sent out trucks to do

his business. He died in 1968. News of his death spread by word of mouth

through the desert. One day a letter arrived for his son. It was from Niger,

and it said that his father had forty-five sheep there; he should come and get

them. The son had never heard of these animals. He checked the will and found

no mention of them. However, he set out for Niger and eventually found the

nomad whose wife had offered the sheep so many years before. The sheep was

Ahmed's, the nomad said, and so were her offspring.<p>



	The nature of the trade has changed little since then. The destinations are

the same, as is much of the cargo. If anything, Islamic values have grown

stronger. Over tea Abderhadim got down to details. Some of the commerce is

legal. Dates from the northern oases are exported; camels, goats, and chickens

are imported. The exports exceed the imports, and so over the course of a year

the merchants of Tamanrasset build credit in the neighboring countries. Then,

most springs, a fair is held in the town during which the government relaxes

import restrictions. Consumer goods, mostly Japanese, flood across the borders.

The fair is an exception to the regulated Algerian economy -- a sanctioned

experiment in free trade. In Tamanrasset the balance sheets are returned to

zero, and the goods are sold to buyers from the north.<p>



	But the real profits are in smuggling. Abderhadim admitted it reluctantly, and

only because others were in the room. After pointing out that he himself never

broke the law, he explained how it is done. The driver who carries a load of

declared Malian goats into Algeria might on the next trip south head out with

an outlawed cargo of Algerian wheat bought at subsidized prices. The truck that

hauls Algerian dates down the Trans-Saharan to Niger might return by a less

public route with a load of precious car parts.<p>



	"Electronics are the best," one of the guests said. "They are small and light

and easy to hide, and they don't spoil in the heat."<p>



And you can mark them up 1,000 percent.<p>



	The government has fought back with expanded patrols and stiff prison terms.

It has declared a nationwide war on contraband, and is filling the jails with

small-time bunglers. People in Tamanrasset are not concerned. The Sahara is a

big place, and practically unpoliceable.<p>



	Before leaving, I mentioned the fundamentalists. They claim to be economic

liberals. What if they take power? Might they not do away with the import

restrictions? And wouldn't this undercut business? Abderhadim urged me not to

worry. His logic went like this:<p>



	A free-market economy, though of course desirable, is only a remote

possibility.<p>



	The Islamic fundamentalists are moralistic, which is of course also desirable.

They might find new reasons to ban consumer goods.<p>



	Thanks be to Allah, business prospects in Tamanrasset remain excellent.<p>





<font size=5>I</font>N the town's poorest neighborhoods the houses are small and dilapidated but

still private. Travelweary Land Rovers list through the streets. An old man

ushers a donkey and cart out of a passageway. Veiled women duck out of sight

when a stranger approaches.<p>



Despite the obvious poverty, there is no sense of overcrowding or misery. The

children playing in the dirt seem bright, well-nourished, happy. There is no

denying the successes of Algerian socialism: literacy among the young is almost

universal; medical care is free; in a country where under the French people

sometimes ate locusts to stay alive, no one goes hungry. As the socialist

system disintegrates, it is being replaced by other forms of welfare, including

the extended family, money sent home from Europe, and the Islamic requirement

to give to the poor. Money as well as power is being concentrated in the hands

of the imams.<p>



	Misery in Tamanrasset is reserved for the desert outskirts, where refugees

from Mali and Niger suffer hunger and disease. Most are illegal immigrants.

They live in shacks and donated Red Cross tents. The smallest children go

naked, and the older ones dress in rags. Flies infest their eyes. There are no

medical clinics, no schools, and only a few wells. The men look for day work,

the women take in laundry, and the young boys go downtown to beg and to hawk

cigarettes. They cause trouble and commit crimes, for which they are resented.

The parallels to Algerians in France are ironic and unavoidable.<p>



	The neglect is intentional. Two years ago the chief of police told me, "The

drought is over. It's time they left." Since then many of the refugees have

been deported, but the next drought has hit, and others have replaced them. It

is a sign of the desperation farther south that people keep coming.<p>





<font size=5>A</font>DDOUN does not like the French. They imprisoned his father during the war of

independence, and killed perhaps a million others. The memories are fresh. And

there are more recent reasons. As an army officer, Addoun went to visit friends

in Paris and Marseilles. I have seen pictures of him on the trip, standing

erect in jacket and tie, looking like a movie version of a sophisticated Arab.

He describes staying on Isle St. Louis in an elegant townhouse with linen napkins, fawning servants, and an

immaculate bathroom. The luxury offended his spartan tastes. He fled south on

the train, and suffered the hostility of his fellow passengers. On the Cote

d'Azur he was thrown out of a cafe for being Algerian. Now in Tamanrasset he

endures the French tourists.<p>



	Other tourists include Germans, Swiss, Italians, and sometimes Japanese. There

are not as many now as before; the political troubles keep them away. But you

see them wandering the streets in cautious groups. Most come in by plane and

stay a few days on a package tour. They buy gifts, ride camels through the

outlying hills, and are taken in fourwheel-drive caravans into the Hoggar

Mountains, where they visit the Christian hermitage founded by Charles de

Foucauld in 1910. The hermitage, staffed by monks, consists of five stone huts

atop the 8,950-foot Assekrem Plateau, a windswept high point sixty miles from

Tamanrasset. The view is desolate and unending. For a few dollars you can spend

the night in a stone dormitory.<p>



	A different breed altogether are the Europeans who come to Tamanrasset on the

Trans-Saharan. For them the town is just a way station on the long trip across

the desert. The ones remembered are the lone eccentrics, the walkers,

wanderers, bicycle riders, and lost souls. One man came through pushing a

wheelbarrow. He was Swiss, and he pushed his wheelbarrow through much of Africa.<p>



	Most of the motorists -- the ones you see daily on the main street -- are more

conventional. They travel in groups of four-wheel-drive trucks, usually to

Dakar or Abidjan or some other famous place with a beach. The trucks are

equipped with colorful decals, with placards proclaiming EXPEDITION, and with

gas cans, tires, shovels, and steel tracks for the sand. The drivers are

dashing and self-conscious, mostly Germans and French playing the explorer.

They wear bandannas around their necks and swagger through the hotel, smelling

of sweat and dust, talking loud. Addoun calls them "chichi." They seem to have

seen too many cigarette ads.<p>



	Then there are those who pass through in two-wheeldrive luxury sedans,

especially Mercedes. The cars are to be sold in Niger, or Nigeria, or points

beyond. A Mercedes Benz is the ultimate earthly good in Africa, and the class

of traders, politicians, and smugglers that floats on top has earned a new

name -- the <i>Wabenzi</i>. Many of these cars on the Trans-Saharan are said to be

stolen, provided with papers to satisfy the Algerian police. They are driven by

experienced drivers. I talked to one Frenchman who had made the trip fifteen

times before. He was barrel-chested and balding, with a drooping moustache and

muscular arms -- a tough guy right off the docks of Marseilles. I asked if he

worried about losing his way. No, never, he said. He did this for a living. I

didn't ask what he had done before. He took me to see the BMW he was ferrying

south. Under the dust and mud it was gleaming black and very new. It had a

digital radio and a burglar alarm. I asked him if he ever had trouble. No,

never.<p>



	There are others for whom driving a car, stolen or not, is a one-time

adventure. Most are young, middle-class, and studiously carefree. They are

thin, bearded Germans and tangle-haired Frenchwomen. In Africa they have

rejected the constraints of European society. They wear Ali Baba pants and

sandals, and have the kind of self-congratulatory conversations you hear

between cruising yachtsmen in warm waters. These are the people who get lost.

It happens most often after they leave Tamanrasset, somewhere on the way to the

border of Niger or in the hundreds of miles of wilderness that lie beyond. It

is fierce country. Every month it gives up the bodies of the naive and the

reckless.<p>



	Recently four young Germans -- three men and a woman -- left Tamanrasset in a

Mercedes. They drove south to within sixty miles of Niger and then turned east,

probably to avoid the border police. They got lost. They wandered 400 miles to

the Libyan border, turned around, wandered back, and ran out of gas. Their

families came to Tamanrasset to search for them. They distributed copies of a

poster with photographs. Absurdly, the poster was written in German. In bold

print it read, LOST IN WEST AFRICA! Weeks later the Mercedes and three male

corpses were found. The woman was presumed buried by blowing sand.<p>



	I saw the poster tacked to a wall at La Source, a hostel built around a spring

of bubbling mineral water three miles outside town. I was there for tea with

Addoun and his friends. The poster was in the entranceway, and the photographs

had been slashed with a knife. When I remarked on this to my companions, they

seemed unsympathetic.<p>



	"They're dead anyhow," one said, as if that explained the slashes.<p>



"They brought it on themselves," said another.<p>



	Addoun was more expansive. "The families blamed us for not finding them

alive -- but how could we have? Just look at the emptiness here."<p>



<font size=4><b>Driving in the Sahara</b></font><p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE dangers of driving in the Sahara are not limited to foreigners. Anyone can

break down. Anyone can get lost. Salah Addoun has at various times said to

me:<p>



	"When you break down, you have to be calm, because the desert is calm."<p>



	"When you get lost, you should sit. Wait. One hour, two hours, a full day.

Sit. You will find your orientation."<p>



	"Tourists panic and drive aimlessly. They are afraid of the lion before the

lion."<p>



	"As you believe in life, you must also believe in death."<p>



	In a northern oasis I met a retired truck driver, a lively old man named Lag

Lag who had nearly perished in the desert in 1957. Lag Lag and an assistant

were driving a diesel rig through trackless sand when they lost their way;

after several days of wandering they ran out of fuel. They carried water, and

so they were in no immediate danger. But the long-term prospects were not good.

Walking out was impossible, and it was unlikely that anyone would come their

way. The sun forced them into the shade under the truck, where they dug a

shallow trench. Day after day they lay there, watching their water dwindle and

waiting for Allah's will. They turned inward to Islam, and talked about death

and afterlife. Though they had a small supply of food, they abstained from

eating, fearing that it would magnify their thirst. Dehydration, not

starvation, is what kills in the desert. And thirst is among the most terrible

of all human sufferings.<p>



	The physiologists who specialize in thirst seem never to have experienced it.

This surprises me. You would think that someone interested in thirst would want

to stop drinking for a while. It is easy to arrange, and can be done safely.

But the physiologists pursue knowledge, not experience. They use words based in

Greek, which soften the subject. For instance, they would describe the

Sahara -- the burning sand, the fierce, relentless sky -- as 

<i>dipsogenic</i>, meaning

"thirst-provoking." In discussing Lag Lag's case, they might say he progressed

from <i>eudipsia</i>, meaning "ordinary thirst," through bouts of 

<i>hyperdipsia</i>, meaning

"temporary intense thirst," to <i>polydipsia</i>, by which they mean "sustained,

excessive thirst." We can define it more precisely: since <i>poly</i> means "many,"

<i>polydipsia</i> means "the kind of thirst that drives you to drink anything. " There

are specialized terms for such behavior, including <i>uriposia</i>, "the drinking of

urine," and <i>hemoposia</i>, "the drinking of blood." For word enthusiasts, this is

heady stuff. Nonetheless, the lexicon has not kept up with technology. Blame

the ancients for not driving cars. I have tried, and cannot coin a suitable word for "the

drinking of radiator coolant."<p>



	This is what Lag Lag and his assistant started drinking. They had been under

the truck for several weeks. They wrote good-bye letters to their families and

stuck them up in the cab. The assistant cried. Lag Lag was annoyed and said,

"When you die, you die." He was a good Muslim. He lay calm.<p>



	Finally, the two of them having drunk most of the coolant, Lag Lag had an

inspiration. He drained oil from the engine and poured it into the fuel tank.

The assistant had given up hope, and wanted no part in the experiment. Lag Lag

figured the oil would combine with the dregs of diesel fuel, and the mixture

might ignite. He climbed into the cab, cycled the glow plug, and pressed the

starter. The engine turned over and rumbled to life. The astonished assistant

scrambled aboard. Spewing dense blue smoke, the truck rolled forward. After

some miles they came to a track. With no idea where they were, or where the

track led, they followed it. Allah was with them. A refrigerated van appeared,

with water, meats, and vegetables. It was driven by a friend. They broke the

seal on the back, built a fire, drank, and feasted. As the specialists say,

they rehydrated.<p>





<font size=5>D</font>RIVING in the north is no longer so dangerous. A network of hard-surfaced

roads branches out from the Trans-Saharan, linking the oases. The roads are

narrow and sometimes interrupted by drifting sand, but well maintained.

Although the distances are great, help is never far away. There are cargo

trucks, passenger buses, army-convoys, occasional private cars, and swarms of

yellow taxicabs. These taxis, mostly beat-up Peugeot station wagons, shuttle

from one oasis to the next. Airline managers must dream of such schedules: the

taxis never leave with less than a full load, and they arrive when they please.

In that sense they are like the bush taxis of black Africa, but they are less

crowded (only six passengers) and better driven. They are also better driven

than the cabs of New York, and much cheaper. For the price of a trip from Grand

Central to La Guardia, you can travel a full day in the Sahara. The desert

undulates under a brilliant sky. You pass a ruined fortress, a stand of palms,

a camel wandering untethered, a dry riverbed filled with refracted sunlight,

shimmering like water. There is no dispatch radio. Instead, a tape deck plays

melodic readings of the Koran.<p>



	The south is different. There are few roads and few taxis. You drive most of

the time over open desert, following tracks that are braided, eroded, obscured

by dirt and sand. The braiding occurs when one driver gets stuck and others

detour around the signs of trouble, making new tracks. Still others follow,

mire down in turn, and pick new ways through. The Oregon Trail used to braid

the same way. In the Sahara every truck, every car, every motorcycle leaves its

trace. This repeats itself over the years until a route consists of a band

maybe twenty miles wide of crisscrossing tire marks. Intersecting routes lead

off to unknown destinations. Seen from the air, the tracks might make sense; on

the ground they become hopelessly confusing. People follow them in circles.

There is no one to ask directions from, and no one to help you if you break

down. South of Tamanrasset heavy traffic on the Trans-Saharan means two trucks

passing ten miles apart, on opposite ends of a basin.<p>



	This is a subject close to Salah Addoun. His father was lost in the desert

while driving with friends. It was 1962, the year of Algerian independence.

Addoun's father wrote farewells on his <i>chch</i>. He survived a month and was the

last to die. The next day his body was discovered. Addoun was six.<p>



	Years later Addoun set out on a trip at sunset, to avoid the heat of day.

After a full night of driving he came to some lights -- and found himself back

where he had started. As he says, Allah did not choose his death then. More

recently he was a passenger in a desert taxi across the sands southwestward

from al Golea to a village called al Homr. After a while one of the passengers

said to the driver, "Where are you going?"<p>



"To al Homr."<p>



The passenger said, "No, al Homr is toward that star there."

He pointed to the left. The driver was unsure. The passenger took the wheel and

followed the star to safety.<p>



	These are the skills of the nomad, and they require an encyclopedic knowledge

of the land. One old man explained navigation this way: "Yes, by the stars at

night. In daylight by local knowledge of the desert -- this soil, this tree, this

ruin, these tracks, these shadows before sunset. It is passed down from father

to son, and spoken of among friends." He said "local," but we were discussing

the smugglers who drive hundreds of miles across the open desert.<p>



	Concerned about the number of drivers lost in the south, the Algerian

government has marked the main routes with metal pylons every ten kilometers.

Ten kilometers is 6.21 miles, and drivers still get lost. For marking the

Trans-Saharan south of Tamanrasset, the authorities decided on something more

visible. This is the stretch that causes the most trouble. For 280 miles the

route descends across infernal badlands to the border with Niger. There are no

wells and few landmarks. Drivers take days to negotiate it. The solution was to

be 451 white concrete markers, one every kilometer. A kilometer is 0.621 miles,

an easy distance for seeing from one marker to the next. Addoun's company won

the contract. It was springtime. He set off from Tamanrasset on foot followed

by a three-man crew in a Land Cruiser carrying supplies and topographic charts.

Over two weeks he walked the entire distance, surveying thirty kilometers a day

and driving stakes at the prescribed intervals. He did this as casually as you

or I might go for a weekend stroll -- no photographers, no expedition flags.

Once the stakes were in place, he returned to Tamanrasset, gathered a larger

crew, and set off with trucks carrying steel molds. Pouring the concrete took

an additional three months. Thinking of his father, I asked if the walking had

been a pilgrimage of sorts. He smiled and said he had needed the exercise. I

asked if his markers would make the driving easy. He said no, he was not a

dreamer. Smugglers and adventurers would still get lost. People would still

take shortcuts, break down, or get stuck. And the tracks would still braid.<p>



<font size=5>I</font> caught a ride on one of a pair of battered trucks exporting dates down the

Trans-Saharan to Agadez, Niger. It was the only public transportation available

heading south. Addoun saw me off. He introduced me to the chief driver, a

bearded man with quick, amused expressions, whose name was Ali. He wore stained

trousers, a ragged shirt, and no shoes. Addoun had told me that Ali was the

best: he practically lived in the desert. He was a trader as well as a driver;

the trucks and the cargoes belonged to him. The dates were lowquality export

varieties in burlap sacks. I asked Ali what he would return with from Niger. He

said chickens.<p>



The other driver was a gaunt, silent Tuareg, who spoke no French and little

Arabic. I was assigned to his truck. Addoun gave me a <i>chch</i> against the sun

and dust, a blanket for the nights, and a sack of oranges to share with my

fellow passengers. On my truck there were ten of them -- Tuaregs and black

Africans, immigrant workers heading home. They peered down at me from atop the

cargo. I threw my duffle on board and climbed up to join them. Each driver had

an assistant, and started rolling without him. The assistants pretended not to

notice. At the last possible moment they swung into the cabs. It was late

afternoon.<p>



By sundown we had settled into a rhythm. The trucks were like great beasts,

guided lovingly across treacherous terrain. We wallowed and rolled, hesitated,

backed, and shuddered. The gears ground. On high-speed level ground the engines

bellowed and the tires heaved dust, and we hit twenty miles an hour It was not

to be a fast trip.<p>



The darkness closed around us, and we probed it cautiously with yellow

headlights. The trucks competed for the lead. Now we were ahead, watching our

dust swirl around Ali's lights; now we were behind, tasting his dirt, following

his single red taillight. We made camp late, drank from fifty-gallon drums

lashed to the chassis, and built two miserly fires. Campfires in the Sahara are

fed by twigs and refuse, and are sparing of fuel. I have seen entire meals

cooked on a few scraps of cardboard. Tonight we baked unleavened bread in the

sand below the fires. After scraping the loaves clean we shredded them into

goat stew, and ate from communal bowls. The air turned cool. I walked away and

rolled myself into a blanket under brilliant stars. The desert was silent.<p>



Hours later a truck passed. I heard its engine clearly, and after a while saw

its lights creeping through the distance. It crested a rise maybe five miles

away and disappeared. Someone was pushing hard for the border, giving dimension

to the night.<p>



	We left before dawn, and the next day passed through a land of torn hills,

where sand lay in pockets too deep to escape. This was why passengers were

taken along: the trucks bogged down often. You could sense the trouble coming

on: the double-clutching of uncooperative gears, the desperate shifting-down,

the shuddering loss of momentum, the halt, the surrender. We dug ourselves out

with hands, shovels, and sand ladders. The sand ladders were ten-foot segments

of portable runways from the Second World War -- perforated metal strips,

designed to link together and support the weight of an airplane. Now they

supported the export of dates. Each truck carried a pair. I sometimes had the

feeling we were digging our way across the Sahara. Other people had not

succeeded; we passed the rusted hulks of their cars, partly buried in the sand.

I saw an old Volvo, a Lada, Renaults, Peugeots, Volkswagen buses, and a Fiat

clustered around the worst spots.<p>



	In the late afternoon nomadic children materialized from the empty desert.

They ran toward us in a flock, waving plastic bottles to be filled. We stopped

and gave them water. They had copper skin, ragged robes, and hair in wild

dreadlocks. They begged for sugar, but we had none. I finally spotted their

camp at the base of a hill -- two tents, some goats, a camel, a woman watching.

The children waited for us to leave. They stood looking up, shielding their

eyes from the sun. Then they trudged off, lugging the heavy water bottles. They

lived this way, off the traffic of the Trans-Saharan. It has become a moving

oasis.<p>



	That night I mentioned to Ali that I had seen only one of Addoun's markers.

Ali answered, "It's better to find your own way. " I asked when we would get to

the border. He was amused by the question. "Maybe not tomorrow," he said.<p>



	Maybe not ever, I thought the following afternoon. Against all reason, the

trucks had been driving in loose formation, miles apart, as if to demonstrate

that maddening disinclination to prudence that one encounters so frequently in

the Third World. I was angered but not surprised when we lost sight of each

other.  After an hour in a maze of trackless basins, I began to worry. So,

apparently, did our driver. He parked, killed the engine, and without a word

marched off to a nearby hill, where he stood looking. I followed him. In all

directions the land was empty. I left him there and returned to the truck. My

concern was not Ali but the ignorance of our driver. I sat and waited. The

desert was calm. I had hours to consider the worst. Somewhere out here, perhaps

not far away, the Belgians had been lost.<p>



	They were husband, wife, and five-year-old boy, driving a Peugeot sedan for

resale in Burkina Faso. At first their trip went fast, from Algiers through the

northern oases to points south. Eventually the pavement ended. They were

prepared to spend nights in the desert, but the driving was slower than

expected. They were encouraged when they made Tamanrasset. After resting there

they pushed on, planning on three days to the border.<p>



	When they got lost, they still had plenty of gas, and they set out to retrace

their route. This was not easy, because the ground was hard-packed and rocky.

They grew even more confused. But getting lost was part of the adventure, a

special game for carefree Europeans. We know this because the woman later wrote

it down. People dying of thirst in the desert often leave a written record.

They have time to think. Writing denies the isolation.<p>



 The car broke down. They rationed their water and lay in the shade of a

tarpaulin. The rationing did not extend their lives. They might as well have

drunk their fill, since the human body loses water at a constant rate even when dehydrated. The only

way to stretch your life in the desert is to reduce your water needs: stay put,

stay shaded, and keep your clothes on.<p>



	The Belgians hoped a truck would pass. For a week they waited, scanning the

horizon for a dust-tail or the glint of a windshield. The woman wrote more

frantically. Their water ran low, then dry. They grew horribly thirsty. After filtering it

through a cloth, they drank the radiator coolant.<p>



	Water is the largest component of our bodies, but we have little to spare. In

the hottest desert we can lose it (mostly by sweating) at the rate of two

gallons a day while resting in the shade, or four gallons a day walking.

Because sweating keeps us cool, we function well in extreme heat as long as we

have plenty of water. We need a <i>lot</i> of water -- say, half again as much as a camel over the course of a year. The

rule is to drink until your thirst is gone and then drink a little more. If

water is available, you naturally maintain your fluid content within a range of a quarter of a

percent. If water is not available, juice, Coke, or beer is just as good.

Apparently, radiator coolant also works. But what happens when it all runs out? Inevitably this becomes the

question for anyone stranded in the Sahara. I can only list the symptoms.<p>



Thirst is first felt when the body has lost about 0.5 percent of its weight to

dehydration. For a 180-pound man that amounts to about a pint. With a two

percent loss (say, two quarts) the stomach is no longer big enough to hold as much as the

body needs, and people stop drinking before they have replenished their loss,

even if they are given ample water. This is called voluntary dehydration, though it is not a

conscious choice. Up to a five percent loss (about one gallon) the symptoms

include fatigue, loss of appetite, flushed skin, irritability, increased pulse rate, and

mild fever. Beyond that lie dizziness, headache, labored breathing, absence of

salivation, circulatory problems, blue skin, and slurred speech. At 10 percent

a person can no longer walk. The point of no return is around 12 percent (about

three gallons), when the tongue swells, the mouth loses all sensation, and swallowing becomes

impossible. A person this dehydrated cannot recover without medical assistance.

In the Sahara it may take only half a day to get to this stage. Now the skin

shrinks against the bones and cracks, the eyes sink, and vision and hearing

become dim. Urine is dark and urination is painful. Delirium sets in. In a hot desert climate, as the body

dehydrates, a disproportionate amount of water is drawn from the circulating

blood. The blood thickens and finally can no longer fulfill its functions, one

of which is to transport heat generated within the body to the surface. It is

this heat that ultimately kills. The end comes with an explosive rise in body

temperature, convulsions, and blissful death.<p>





	After the radiator coolant was gone, the Belgians started sipping gasoline.

You would too. Call it <i>petroposia</i>: Saharans have recommended it to me as a way

of staying off battery acid. The woman wrote that it seemed to help. They drank

their urine. She reported that it was difficult at first, but that afterward it

wasn't so bad.<p>



	The boy was the weakest, and was suffering terribly. In desperation they

burned their car, hoping someone would see the smoke. No one did. They killed

their son to stop his pain. Later the husband cut himself and the wife drank

his blood. At his request she somehow broke his neck with a rock. Alone she no

longer wanted to live. Still, the Sahara was fabulous, she wrote, and she was

glad to have come. She would do it again. She regretted only one thing -- that

she had not seen Sylvester Stallone in Rambo III. Those were her last lines.

The family's remains were found later, and returned to Tamanrasset.<p>



<font size=5>S</font>it, wait, you will find your orientation. Ali drove up after several hours. He

had been behind us, stuck in deep sand over his wheels; we had not been lost at

all. We headed south again, and arrived at the border late in the night, at the

village of In-Guezzam.<p>



	To find In-Guezzam, go to the end of the earth and keep driving. It sits on a

hot plain, a sad settlement of adobe and concrete -- a customs outpost and police

station, a cafe, a gas station, a dirt runway, and a few houses. We spent the

morning at the Algerian exit post, filling in forms and answering questions

from hostile policemen. When they released us, we drove off into the braided

noman's-land that separates the two countries. These noman's-lands exist

everywhere in the Sahara, presumably because the countries are too hostile to

put their posts back to back.<p>



	After fifteen miles we came to the border station at Assamakka, Niger. A line

of fifty-gallon drums stood in the dirt, a roadblock without a road. On the

other side was a settlement of shacks, a tree, and a barracks. The soldiers

were black-skinned southerners. One wore an Australian bush hat and carried a

Bowie knife. Another wore twin pearl-handled revolvers. A third fingered an

automatic rifle. I wondered what they had done to be banished to the remote

north of their country. They seemed discouraged by fate, and resentful at being

waked from their midday dreams. After taking our passports they ordered us to

unload the trucks, every sack. Then they went back to sleep. Children emerged

from the shacks, hawking cigarettes, soft drinks, and chickens. Two Ethiopians

approached me for help. They had been deported by Algeria and refused entry by

Niger. For weeks they had been stuck between the countries, living on donations

from passing strangers. They were hungry and sick. I gave them my blanket and

my last oranges. They handed me a crudely written letter to the United Nations

High Commissioner on Refugees. I promised to pass it on when I got to the

capital, and I did.<p>



	The guards returned to probe the sacks for hidden weapons, which they said

were being smuggled to the rebellious Tuareg. Ali remarked, "Why would we come

through this checkpoint? It is a big desert." He seemed amused, and infinitely

patient. The guards pawed through our luggage, confiscating the small

stuff -- pens, batteries, and rolls of film. They did not ask directly for money.

After another day they seem to have realized that Ali would outwait them. They

stamped our passports and let us go.<p>



<font size=5>I</font>n Arlit, 150 miles to the southeast, you have made the crossing and have

arrived suddenly in black Africa. Arlit, in Niger, is a uranium town. The

streets are noisy and bustling, and travelers from the desert are greeted by

energetic hustlers. The Sahara is all around, but now the road is paved. It

leads south for another 150 miles, to the ancient caravan center of Agadez.<p>



	Agadez is a poor, mudwalled town, dominated by a sixteenth-century adobe

mosque and its Sudanese-style minaret, rising ninety feet above the dusty

streets. Once, the town sat on the southern fringe of the desert, and prospered

on a booming trade in slaves, gold, and salt. Now the desert has moved farther

south, and the town runs on a little commerce, a little charity, and a little

international aid. There are wells here, and government offices. As a result,

the population of Agadez has swollen with refugees from the droughts. The

refugees remain even when the rains come. Their herds are dead, and they have

nothing to return to.<p>



	From Agadez I took a bus 550 miles southwest to Niamey, the capital of Niger,

and watched the desert disappear. It was a good, clean bus, with

air-conditioning and a stereo. The driver sat upright and wore lightly tinted

sunglasses. There was drama in the way he drove, flashing through villages,

overtaking the cars ahead. He had a multi-tone horn, and he could make it talk.

Thanking, scolding, proclaiming, the Niamey bus was coming through.<p>



	At first the land was barren, a desert of gravel and gullies. Then acacias

became more frequent. Three hours out of Agadez the country turned to rolling,

eroded grassland, inhabited in the valleys by isolated families. Later the

grass turned thicker, and the country began to resemble American rangeland,

with goats and long-haired cattle. There were villages of round huts and

cultivated fields of hand-planted corn. Then we came to a reservoir, the first

open water I had seen in thousands of miles. The wind pushed up little waves

that lapped the shores. The shores were farmed. There were flooded trees. I

delighted: water is life.<p>



	We stopped only for roadblocks and prayers. At the roadblocks illiterate

soldiers peered at our identity papers and tried to record our names in

ledgers. They asked me to help. At prayer time the passengers knelt together in

the dirt, and the driver responded by playing a cassette of the Koran.<p>



After dark we drove along the border with Nigeria, through frequent villages.

There was no electricity and no moon, and the night was black. In the markets

lining the road the vendors lighted their wares with kerosene lanterns. There

were hundreds of them, casting flickering orange light on thousands of milling

villagers. Everyone was outside, enjoying the evening. We stopped for dinner in

the largest town, and I wandered in the crowds, listening to the constant

calling. Sitting on a bench with others, I ate a bowl of rice with a spicy

sauce, impossible to see in the darkness.<p>



	In Niamey I went to the national museum to find the remnants of a famous tree.

It was an acacia, and it had grown in the Tenere, the great sand desert east of

Agadez. For hundreds of miles in any direction it was the only tree. Maps

showed it. Then, in 1973, a Libyan truck driver collided with it and knocked it

down. The trunk was hauled to the museum. Out in the Tenere a simple metal

statue was erected. Someday I will go to see it, a most peculiar monument to

driving in the desert.  <p>



<font size=4><b>Desertification in Mauritania</b></font><p>



<font size=5>S</font>ome 4,000 miles to the west of Niger, beyond Mali, lies 

Mauritania. I flew to

Nouakchott, its capital, which is accessible in virtually no other way. There

are no tourists in Mauritania. It is one of the world's most wretched

countries. Malnutrition and disease are endemic, and in bad years there is

famine. There are few roads, schools, or hospitals. Politics is driven by

poverty, fear, and racial division. The military rules repressively. The towns

are in disarray. For all this the Sahara can be blamed. The desert is expanding

rapidly and has overwhelmed the country.<p>



	Mauritania was given life by the French in 1960, as a desert nation to be

ruled by desert nomads but to include a fertile strip of savanna and riverland

along the southern border. In thirty years much has changed. By leaps and

bounds the savanna is turning to sand. The drought has done more than damage

the savanna; it has deepened the desert itself. Dunes have buried whole

villages.<p>



	In theory there are solutions. You can drill wells, irrigate crops, stabilize

dunes, and plant trees. You can teach people to use the land more carefully,

not to overgraze, overcut, or overpopulate. You can balance indigenous and

imported technologies. You can preach hope that agriculture in the south might

someday feed the country's two million people.<p>



	In fact there is little reason for optimism. Only rain can threaten the

desert, and in recent years there has been mostly drought. The power of weather

dwarfs human effort. In the past decades the pluviometric threshold of six

inches of annual rainfall -- the minimum for grazing -- has moved south sixty

miles. Nouakchott, once surrounded by grasslands, is now swept by blowing

sand.<p>



	The Sahara is mercurial, and does not attack in regimental formation. It

sprouts in barren patches here and there, perhaps a hundred miles ahead of the

absolute desert, and bypasses the greenbelts planted to block its advance.

Greenbelts are trees, Maginot lines in a losing war against the climate. If

they survive, they protect only themselves. Farther on, around a well, near a

village, for miles outside a city, the land goes bad. People steepen the

decline once it has begun. There are more of them than ever before, wielding

better tools. But it is hard to blame them. They cannot wish themselves away,

and they must eat. The land cannot support them. The rains have stopped. This

is the process called desertification.<p>



	The flight gave me no preparation for the conditions in Mauritania. I sat

comfortably in the airplane watching the sun set against the ocean horizon,

drinking strong black coffee. A fog bank lay below us. To the east the Sahara

stretched in graceful plains. I sampled a pastry. I wiped my hands with

perfumed towelettes. Then we were on final approach over a coastal desert of

sand and gravel. Shacks passed by the right wing. We landed, and disembarked by

a ramshackle terminal. The dusk was thick with heat, dirt, and humidity. Within

minutes my shirt was soaked through.<p>



	Mauritania is edged on the west by the sea, on the north by the Polisario

rebellion of the Western Sahara, on the east by the roadless desert, and on the

south by hostilities with Senegal. The Nouakchott airport is the gateway to the

outside world, and the few flights are booked weeks in advance. With some

regret I watched the airplane depart for Mali. The remaining daylight was gray

and threatening. I did not like the looks of the soldiers who loitered on the

ramp, eyeing the passengers. I stood in the crowd, fighting mosquitoes and

flies. Ahead, the police were carefully checking identities, and bodily

searching the men. I wondered what they hoped to find.<p>



	The other passengers were native Mauritanians, returning from the hajj

pilgrimage to Mecca. Most were Moors, members of a Berber subgroup who speak an

Arabic dialect known as Hassaniya and who form the upper caste of Mauritanian

society. The men wore traditional Saharan robes, while the women wore full

dresses with colorful scarves, and went unveiled. Though many people

undoubtedly spoke French, none would talk to me. They were reluctant to be seen

with a foreigner.<p>



	Mauritanian society is closed and hierarchical. Below the ruling caste of

Moors is a Haratin class of slaves and ex-slaves, known as Black Moors. Slavery

was banned in 1980, but it continues today. That is less shocking than it might

seem: free people die of starvation in Mauritania, and some slaves prefer their

servitude. The third level of society, below the Haratins, is made up of

farmers and pastoralists from the sub-Saharan south -- black Africans with ties

to Senegal and Mali, who have never been integrated into the desert society.

They inhabit the savanna and the prime farmland along the Senegal River, and

constitute perhaps half the population. The Africans are a problem for the

ruling Moors, who despise and fear them and worry that they will rise in

revolt. The Moors would like to reduce their numbers.<p>



	In April of 1989 riots broke out for three days, during which 400 of these

"foreign" blacks were hunted down and slaughtered. Afterward Mauritania

expelled as many as 170,000 of them, calling them Senegalese. Senegal responded

in kind, and the two nations settled into the state of near-war that exists

today. In Mauritania the persecution continues. Along the Senegal River the

army is driving people from their land. There are rumors of killings. In the

name of national security the area has been closed to outside observers.<p>





<font size=5>O</font>fficially it is called the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. This is a cynical

play on words, but one with relevance to the country. In Mauritania the

military has assumed not only command of the government but also the trappings

of Islamic purity. Islam there has become a tool of social control, wielded to enforce discipline. Shari'a, the severe Islamic code,

was instituted in 1980, both to pre-empt the small fundamentalist movement and

to reinforce the power of the ruling Moors. Since then the government's Islamic

rhetoric has grown stronger, and for the same reasons. The African underclass,

though devoutly Muslim, is not pleased. Arabism and Islam are closely linked.

By declaring its religious credentials, the military has aligned itself with

the Arab north, at the expense of the Africans. In Mauritania policy usually

boils down to racial division. For now no one dares to object. The military

knows what it is doing.  As thc Sahara squeezes the populations together, the

choice is between Islamic discipline and ethnic disunity, between the military

and all-out civil war. In Mauritania, Islam is martial law.<p>



	Nouakchott itself is a political creation, founded in 1957 as the capital of

the soon-to-be nation. It is a dispersed, low-rise city of boulevards and

blockhouse architecture -- a place that speaks of the Mauritanian expanse. Goats

wander the alleys. Donkeys haul loads of precious firewood to be sold in small

bundles. The buildings are concrete, crumbling, dirty, and hot. There are few

cars and fewer trucks. Scant downtown traffic lights regulate the flow of green

Toyota vans packed to the limit with thirty or more passengers. The wind blows

constantly, carrying the desert with it. Sand is everywhere. Slowly it is

turning even the busiest streets into tracks. Inside the buildings workers

sweep it, shovel it, and take it back outside.<p>



	The most surprising fact about Nouakchott is its size. Downtown you might

guess it at 100,000 inhabitants. The actual number is closer to 800,000 -- more

than a third of the entire country's population. Most of the people are Moors.

They live in squatters' camps that ring the city, and are discouraged from

coming downtown by government policy and lack of transportation. Many are

semi-nomadic: if the summer rains come, they leave with their goats for the

open desert. When the season changes and the land can no longer support them,

they return to the capital, where there is electricity and water. The goats

graze on refuse, at times on cardboard alone. The people have more elaborate

needs. They suffier hunger and sickness, but in Nouakchott, at least, they

manage to stay alive. Nouakchott is Mauritania's most efficient distribution

center for foreign food and medicines.<p>



	I drove out to the squatters' camps with a Moorish businessman who explained

his work as "sometimes import-export." We went to the animal market, in a sea

of tents and flimsy shacks. Pencil-thin nomads crowded around us. My host said,

"They are not as miserable as they seem. They think that by living like this

they can force the government to give them housing and land. It is mostly

fakery." And these were his fellow Moors. I wondered what he thought of the

black Africans.<p>



	We bought a struggling lamb at the market, forced it into the trunk, and drove

home. The businessman lived in a two-story concrete house with a large parlor.

It was too hot inside, so we sat out back on a rug in the sand, and drank Coke

and traditional Saharan tea. Nearby a slave slaughtered and skinned the lamb. I

write "slave" without being sure. He was a Haratin black with a peaceful face.

He wore no chains. This is the modern form of slavery -- a lifelong but willing

servitude. I have seen it also in Tamanrasset. If I had asked, he would have

been called a friend of the family. He was clearly more than a servant.<p>



	It was the week of the tree. On the television news we watched a government

minister plant a sapling in the desert. There was no mention of world events.

The businessman sneered. "They are confused and afraid, and don't know what to

say. So they say nothing."<p>



	We went to his office, in a shabby building. He sat in grand style behind a

large desk. On the wall hung the mandatory portrait of the President, Colonel

Taya -- a handsome man with a moustache. I sat at a coffee table. We talked

business -- about the economic potential of Mauritania, the iron deposits in the

north and the rich fishing grounds off the coast. We talked imports and

exports. He argued that American magazines need permanent representatives here.

He discussed the strategic importance of the country. He was like a man on dry

ground pretending to row a boat. The room had not been swept, and sand was

accumulating in the corners.<p>





<font size=5>I</font><i>NSHALLAH</i>: God willing. You hear it again and again in conversation, a sort of

cultural reflex, a constant reminder of faith. We will meet for tea, God

willing. The weather will change, the rains will come, and our herds will

survive, <i>inshallah</i>. And if none of it happens, that, too, is God's will.<p>



	Westerners accuse Islam of excessive fatalism -- but fatalism is just the

ingredient necessary to function in the Sahara. I talked to the director of the

Peace Corps in Mauritania, who said that the American way is to take action

today for a better life tomorrow -- which is equally a statement of faith. In

Mauritania the Peace Corps has proved largely impotent. The desert twitches,

and sweeps aside good intentions. If nature has been subdued in the industrial

West, in the Sahara it, or God, remains the primordial power. You live here as

a guest. Soon you learn to think like others, and find yourself even in your

most private thoughts saying inshallah.<p>





<font size=5>K</font>IFFA is the capital of a region called the Assaba, 350 miles to the east of

Nouakchott, on the paved road that crosses southern Mauritania. The road is

interrupted by frequent security checkpoints. Immediately to the south there is

trouble on the river; to the north there is desert. The law is as capricious as

the weather. The soldiers are uncertain. I went by air to Kiffa, and overflew

their scrutiny.<p>



	Once a fertile savanna, the Assaba has come under full assault by the Sahara.

The airport at Kiffa is a dirt runway scraped through the brown scrubland

outside town. I waited to disembark while an old woman tried to descend the

stairs. She was a back-country Moor, a nomad from the open desert. For minutes

she hesitated in the doorway. She gripped the rails and surveyed the angle. Her

problem was not physical inability but understanding. These were her first

stairs: she had climbed them to get on the airplane, and now she had to figure

a way down. A crowd at the bottom shouted advice. She turned one way, then the

other, and finally started down backward. Halfway down she ran out of ideas and

froze. Her expression was anguished. A group of men came from below and lifted

her to the ground.<p>



	It was summer, the end of the rainy season. A cumulus cloud towered in the

haze and humidity. No one dared hope for a storm; for months the sky had been

full of false promise. The land was sparse. The people at the airport looked idle and

unhealthy.<p>



	I do not know the population of Kiffa, and I am not sure anyone does. It looks

like a town of 10,000; I would guess that because of drought the number is

triple that. Still, it is dispersed and uncrowded. Stone houses line empty dirt

streets. The place is brown and tan, like the desert dust that settles on it.

Groups of young Moorish men in white and pale-blue robes walk abreast. They are

haughty and unwelcoming. Here, too, relations between the races are difficult.

There is a market, run by African women, where the heat is magnified by the

confines of airless alleys. Elsewhere there are a few small grocery stores with

butane refrigerators to keep bottled drinks cool. There is no electricity.

People dig individual wells and drink tainted water. There is no sewage system.

Cholera, polio, measles, tuberculosis, malaria, typhoid, hepatitis, a host of

parasites, and probably AIDS exist here. One death is hardly distinguished from

another<p>



	I stayed in Kiffa with a Peace Corps worker named John Stingley. At age forty

he was a wizened, balding man with a full beard and a cautious expression -- not

the poster image of an enthusiastic volunteer. Stingley was a sometime rock

musician and forester from coastal Oregon. His last job there had been as a

low-paid technician, trudging the rainy slopes and counting saplings. He told

me he joined the Peace Corps out of curiosity. He said he wanted to dry out his

boots.<p>



	He was idealistic, too. With three years of forestry school behind him, and a

lot of practical experience he thought he could do the world some good. The

Peace Corps had sent him to the front lines to plant trees and fight the

Sahara. He was a better soldier than most. Near the completion of the two-year

tour only fifteen of his original group of forty-one volunteers remained. The

others had quit owing to sickness and discouragement. Stingley himself had lost

thirty pounds and gained back only fifteen. He lived in Kiffa utterly alone,

with little backup. His relations with the local authorities were poisoned by

corruption, mistrust, and racial politics. Stingley stayed on, but he no longer

believed he could help. He had grown his trees and watched them die. He blamed

Mauritanian neglect and the weather. Now he was only counting the days until

the end. It is not easy to fight a hopeless war.<p>



	The Peace Corps rented his house from the biggest landlord in town. It was a

two-room bungalow at the center of a walled dirt yard. With the exception of a

scraggly tree by the porch, the yard was bare. This embarrassed Stingley, who

said he would have planted it except for the herds of neighborhood goats. They

were the bane of his existence. They bounded over the walls and wandered the

yard at will. Goats are among the worst culprits in desertification. They eat

even spined plants, and destroy young trees by cropping them down to their

roots. Stingley hated them with professional vigor, but he might have missed

them if they were gone. Together he and the animals danced a mad ballet. When

he spotted them in his yard, he stepped threateningly off the porch and waved

his arms. They watched and pretended not to care. He started after them, and

they thundered around the house in mock fright. He was nimble and sly, and

doubled back to catch them by surprise. They thundered the other way, just out

of reach. He threw stones; they pranced. If he cornered them, they escaped over

the wall and returned later to test his vigilance.<p>



	We drew water from a deep well at the front of the yard. It was a laborious

job of hauling up buckets hand over hand and filling plastic jerricans.

Stingley did not mind. He filtered and sterilized the water with the patience

of a man living alone. His housekeeping was immaculate. He cooked on a camp

stove and ate simply. He kept a daily journal in tight handwriting. He was

proud that he had not been sick for months.<p>







<font size=5>I</font>N brilliant sunlight the next morning we went to the nursery, where a crew of

Africans cared for seedlings under Stingley's direction. The laborers were

employees of the Mauritanian forestry department, to which Stingley was

attached as a sort of extension agent. They had not been paid in months, and

were growing weak from malnourishment. Stingley claimed that the bosses were

keeping the wages. He could not bear the suffering of his men and had lent them

money from his own meager salary. In return they treated him as their friend

and protector. He had protested on their behalf, to no avail. He was frustrated

by his inability to help.<p>



	Still, he brightened up among his seedlings. There were some 40,000 of them in

the nursery, grown in sacks for transplantation. He led me through, bending

over them, cupping the fragile leaves in his hands, discussing the attributes

of the different species. Mostly he raised mesquite, which roots well in

difficult soils, finds water, grows fast, and can be cut to the ground and

survive. The other seedlings were acacias, desert bushes, and a local tree

called the neem, which was his favorite, because of its resistance to goats.<p>



	Within the confines of the nursery the project was successful: after several

reseedings Stingley had achieved a 90 percent germination rate. I asked about

the longer-term prospects of survival. He shook his head, In the United States

the survival rate is roughly 80 percent; he guessed survival in Mauritania to

be at most eight percent, depending on the project. He blamed livestock, lack

of care and watering, and the weather. He described walking through old

projects in which every sapling was dead. He described watching his own

saplings die.<p>



	We discussed the current crop. Most of the trees were intended for planting

along the roads leading out of town. The idea was to fight drifting sand. But

there were no trucks or crews available, and already the planting season was

ending. Stingley had heard rumors that in fact many of the trees were destined

for the yards of the governor and the chief of police. He shrugged. "At least

they might get watered."<p>



	Other trees were being given away on the street. One afternoon, as we watched,

the nursery crew handed 15,000 seedlings over a fence to crowds of women. The

women seemed delighted. Stingley was skeptical. He had wanted to sell them

for.a token fee and include instructions on how to plant them. I asked him if

he thought any would survive. He smiled quizzically and answered, 

<i>Inshallah</i>.<p>



	We went to see recent plantings at the northern edge of town. They were

mesquite bushes, regularly spaced across the upwind slope of a long, powdery

dune. A group of children from nearby houses followed us across a fence and

along the crest. The land to the northeast was a vast eroded plain, a desert

shadow of earlier savanna. A few sturdy trees remained, but the grass was gone,

turned to dirt and sand. The land was harsh but not lifeless. Spiny bushes had

taken root along the washes and in the shelter of rocks. A car track led across

the plain and disappeared into the distance. Out there the main mass of the

Sahara stretched in eternal buttes and sand seas. The sunlight was relentless;

it pushed away even the memory of rain.<p>



	Here on the dune the mesquite plantation had failed. The sand had kept moving,

exposing the roots of the bushes, slowly killing them. The fence sagged where

we and others had climbed over it. Soon it would let in the goats. I asked the

children which way the dune was drifting. They pointed here and there. But I

could see for myself that it threatened their houses. The sand was slipping

into town.<p>

Over the next sixty hours, working in teams of two, they will docalisthenics, run, swim, canoe, orienteer, climb, rappel, shoot, and parachute.They will encode messages, decode messages, assemble weapons, and hurl handgrenades. They will march most of the night, and then they will march all thefollowing night. They are here, voluntarily, for the start of the Best RangerCompetition, probably the most arduous sporting event in the world.<p>The contest, held each spring in southern Georgia, consists of twelve eventsthat follow one another with little pause for two and a half days. During thecompetition the soldiers sleep no more than a few minutes at a time andscarcely eat: only two warm meals are served, neither of them during the brutalfinal thirty-five hours. Were participation coerced, Best Ranger wouldundoubtedly violate the <A HREF="http://www.tufts.edu/departments/fletcher/multi/texts/BH241.txt">Geneva Convention</A>.<p>Not surprisingly, the competition isn't open to the public. To enter, one mustfirst become a Ranger. These soldiers are elite, highly trained members of theU.S. Armed Forces, often used, like Navy SEALs, for hazardous and tacticalmissions. To become a Ranger, a soldier must graduate from the Army'ssixty-one-day Ranger course, widely considered the military's most gruelingprogram. A line from the Ranger credo boasts, "Surrender is not a Ranger word."Rangers are found in all branches of the U.S. military, and also in the armedforces of several foreign countries; all are eligible for the Best RangerCompetition.<p>The contest was founded in 1982, by the Ranger course's commanding officers, asa way to simulate the strain and stress of wartime conditions--and to identifyand honor the most mentally agile and physically fit two-person team in themilitary. (All Ranger training is done in teams of two, and this format isretained for the competition. Both members of a team must complete everyevent.) So far no women have entered, and non-American soldiers have faredpoorly. In the United States, though, the Best Ranger Competition is regardedas an Armed Forces Olympics, and winning it is one of the greatest noncombathonors a soldier can earn. (The only material reward is an engravednine-millimeter Beretta.) So many hundreds of Ranger teams are eager to enterthat some battalions must stage preliminary competitions to see who qualifiesfor the big show.<p><center>	<img src="./art/ranger.gif" width=400 height=160></center><font size=5>A</font><font size=3>lmost to a man, the soldiers who arrive for the 1995 event are sinewy,not brawny; their movements evoke felinity and grace rather than raw power.They are earnest, ramrod soldiers who wear crew cuts and call one "sir" nomatter how many times they're told it's unnecessary. Their sentences arepeppered with military slang: tired Rangers are "smoked puppies"; blisteredsoles are "hamburger feet"; an all-out effort is "going Richter."<p>The team favored to win is a pair from the Hawaii-based 25th Infantry Division:Captain Michael Trisler and Staff Sergeant Eric White. Both men are enteringtheir third Best Ranger Competition, though it's their first together--injuriesto their previous teammates led to their being paired for this event. Both areobsessed with winning. White, who finished fifteenth in 1993, was in positionto win the 1994 competition when a severe case of blisters on his teammate'sfeet slowed them to eleventh place. Trisler, meanwhile, took third in 1993, andthen prepared mightily for the 1994 contest. Like most teams, he and hispartner were granted a special dispensation from regular military duty,allowing them to train full time for four months. A momentary lapse inconcentration during the marksmanship event resulted in a second-place showing.Trisler was scheduled to leave the Army, but decided to remain an extra yearsolely to have another shot at Best Ranger. "During the competition the pain isunrelenting and unbelievable--sixty hours of agony," Trisler says, stretchingwith White a few minutes before the start. "Yet it is somehow addictive. Forthree years this race has completely consumed our lives."<p> Trisler and White, fast friends, create an interesting juxtaposition. Trisler,twenty-seven, a West Point graduate from rural Indiana, is farm-boy blond, withruddy skin and an affable demeanor that masks a fierce competitiveness. At WestPoint he was a standout swimmer and water-polo player (and, indeed, he has aswimmer's willowy physique). He is handsome, brilliant, athletic--the kind ofperson one expects will one day be President. White, twenty-nine, is anenlisted man from the Pennsylvania steel belt, a high school dropout, laconicand introverted, with jet-black hair and sharp eyes. He is less approachablethan Trisler, but also less intense. He was reared on ice hockey and now wearshis Army cap as if it were a helmet, keeping the brim so low that it shades hisentire face. On the backs of White's hands, written in thick black marker, arethe initials <i>A</i>, on the left hand, and <i>W</i>, on the right. Theyserve, White says, as a motivational memorial to his younger brother, Andy, whodied of testicular cancer in 1993.<p>Trisler and White's biggest challenge is expected to come from another teamfrom the 25th Infantry Division, a pair of brash and exceptionally talentedBest Ranger rookies, Sergeant David Howell and First Lieutenant DougMcCormick.<p>The first event is appropriately militaristic: a physical-fitness test.Push-ups --eighty close-cropped heads snapping up and down in the early-morninglight--are followed by sit-ups, a two-mile run, and then pull-ups. Each eventin the Best Ranger contest is scored separately; some are tallied by time, someby place finished, some by a combination of the two. Any given event startsonly after all teams have finished the previous one or have been eliminated byfatigue or cutoff time (each event and subevent has a strictly enforced maximumfinishing time, ranging from thirty seconds for knot tying to twelve hours forland navigation). This system allows the fastest teams to grab a bit of restbetween events, and usually causes the weak groups to drop out swiftly. In anaverage year half the teams are forced to abandon the competition.<p>The second event is rifle marksmanship; it is followed by precision parachutingand a long-distance canoe race. All are held in searing Georgia heat; it's thekind of day when shade is worth money. Soon after sunset--fourteen hours intothe contest--comes the foot march, the event that usually eliminates the mostteams. A twenty-mile-plus nighttime race, the march has been scrupulouslydesigned to torment the soldiers both physically and mentally. The route iskept secret until the event begins, and the exact distance isn't announceduntil the finish (it's always between twenty and twenty-five miles), so thesoldiers roam through the blackness not knowing how far they have to go.<p>The march must be made wearing combat boots and carrying a fully loadedmilitary rucksack--a bulky canvas contraption that weighs sixty-five pounds.Every soldier must also carry an M16 rifle (eight pounds), and one member ofeach team must haul a toaster-oven-sized field radio (twenty-three pounds; withspare battery, another two).<p>The Best Ranger Competition is unlike almost all other endurance contests inbeing a team sport. The pair that develops the best synchronism is usually thepair that wins; two people battling individually are unlikely even to finish."You need to learn your partner's moods better than your spouse's," one Rangersays. "You've got to know when to yell, when to coax, and when to hold his packfor a few minutes." Trisler and White, for example, have perfected a sort ofsymbiotic tug-of-war, Trisler wanting to go all-out all the time, Whitesupplying the voice of moderation. The result is a speed perfectly suited to asixty-hour marathon. <p>During the all-night march the pair move in a state of almost hypnoticconcentration, silently negotiating cadence, scarcely speaking. "Water?" "No.""Pace?" "Fine." And then there is no sound for hours, save for the rhythmicscrape of boots over loose gravel. Trisler and White are the fourth team home,arriving in just under five hours. Their eyes look as dull as the screen of anunplugged television. White's back, chafed raw from the canvas pack, looks asif it had been whipped with a cat-o'-nine-tails. Trisler's socks glisten withblood; his toenails are black.<p>Howell and McCormick appear far healthier. They have finished the foot march insecond place, ten minutes ahead of Trisler and White, and are now first in theoverall standings. Trisler and White are third. Both teams rest while theslower competitors stagger in. Doctors wander through the finish area, lancingblisters. There are sharp hisses through clenched jaws. Ten teams do not makethe six-hour cutoff. <p>After the march, at two-thirty in the morning, the soldiers begin thecompetition's longest event, an extensive series of brief cerebral tasks calledthe Ranger stakes.<p><li> See this pile of metal parts? Assemble an M14 rifle, an M16 rifle, an M60machine gun, and a nine-millimeter pistol from it. Go!<p><li> See this rope? Tie a clove hitch, an anchor bowline, a Prusik, and afigure-eight slipknot. Go!<p><li> See this map? . . . See that sniper? . . . See this detonation cord? . . .See these hand grenades? . . . See that target? . . . See this coded message? .. . And so on, for fifteen hours.<p>The Ranger stakes mark the midpoint of the competition. Howell and McCormickwin the event and strengthen their lead; Trisler and White move up to secondplace. The following event is the climb-and-rappel--a dash up and slide down asixty-foot tower. Then comes land navigation, which is like the foot march onlytougher. Again it takes place during darkness, again the soldiers must carryall their gear, and again the course is unknown. But this time no set route isimposed:the soldiers are given a topographic map and a compass and are droppedoff in the woods twenty miles from camp. The first team home after registeringat eleven checkpoints is the winner.<p><font size=5>B</font><font size=3>y the start of land navigation sixteen of the original forty teams are gone,and most of the remaining soldiers appear slack, lobotomized. Their movementsare disjointed; their minds seem fogged. They are limping, bleeding, groaning.A few are ill. One says nothing but "Ow, ow, ow," in rhythm with his steps.Most teams need nearly the full twelve-hour allotment to complete the course.The coaches, meanwhile, sit around camp and fret. They are almost always BestRanger veterans, and they know how their men feel. They have the delicate taskof selecting teammates--most direct several teams--and are in charge ofdesigning a thorough training schedule. Coaches' theories on Best Rangerpreparation vary. First Sergeant William Ulibarri (1987 winner) says, "You cannever train your body to withstand something like this, but you can train yourmind. Learn to consider pain and sleep as nonexistent and you'll do well."Sergeant First Class Bobby Beiswanger (1990 winner) says, "If you're in amazingshape, if your body can take anything, your brain has no choice but to shut upand follow." Staff Sergeant Pete Roethke (1993 runner-up, and coach of bothTrisler and White and Howell and McCormick) says, "If the boys ain't bitching,you ain't training 'em hard enough."<p>Trisler and White take second in land nav; Howell and McCormick are rightbehind them. The overall standings remain unchanged, and with four events togo, Howell and McCormick's lead seems insurmountable. Trisler even mumblessomething about remaining in the Army <i>another</i> year.<p>Still, the competition is far from over; even by Best Ranger standards, thefinal hours are cruel. Right after land navigation the soldiers must sprintthrough the Army's infamous Darby Queen obstacle course. Over the nearly1.5-mile course are twenty-five obstacles, representing just about everypossible arrangement of pine logs, many in vast, towering structures with nameslike Tarzan and Tough Nut and Belly Buster, which must be climbed up, crawledthrough, balanced upon, and leaped from.<p>Just before Howell and McCormick are scheduled to run the course, their manicpace and Best Ranger inexperience catch up with them. Howell, who has beencomplaining of stomach cramps all night, gets sick: he slumps against a tree,poleaxed by pain. Trisler and White, figuring they'd rather drop fromexhaustion than finish second, decide to go Richter. In one of the mostremarkable performances in Best Ranger history, the pair proceed to break theDarby Queen course record. Their time, just over fourteen minutes, isn't simplya Best Ranger record--it's the all-time best, eclipsing the performances ofthousands of soldiers who have run it fresh. The nearest Ranger team finishesmore than a minute behind them; Howell and McCormick, hurting badly, turn intheir worst performance of the competition--eleventh place. With three eventsleft, the two teams are tied. It's the closest Best Ranger ever.<p>It doesn't end that way. Trisler and White have seemingly tapped into anextraordinary zone beyond exhaustion, an endorphin-splashed runners' high. Theyfinish second in the water-confidence test, a circus-act event that includes arun across a log suspended forty feet above a pond. They win the distanceswim--a quarter-mile lake crossing while dragging a 140-pound load (afterthey've been dropped into the water from a helicopter). And they take fifth inthe buddy run, a 2.7-mile race to the final finish line. Howell and McCormickplace behind them in all three, and the 1995 Best Ranger title goes to Trislerand White.<p><font size=5>A</font><font size=3>t the finish the champions wrap each other in a bear hug that is halfcelebration, half mutual support. They wear the haggard, elated looks of newlyfreed prisoners of war, their mouths dangling open in jellied smiles, theireyelids at three-quarters-mast. Within moments they're the only competitorsstill standing. Around them, strewn at their feet as if in supplication, arethe forty-two other surviving soldiers, moaning and groaning in variedexpressions of anguish. A few will require brief hospitalization, primarily fordehydration. Trisler and White, their wounds relatively minor, embrace forseveral minutes. But then Trisler pulls away, the ebullience in his facetempered by a wrinkle of confusion. For three years the two havesingle-mindedly pursued this goal. Trisler looks at White and asks,tentatively, "Now what do we do?" </blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

Scored for the exotic ensemble of contralto voice,alto flute, viola, guitar, and percussion (including vibraphone, butprominently bongos), <i>Le Marteau </i>was remotely jazzy and vaguely oriental,rhythmically frantic yet emotionally cool. It was atonal, but without the angstof most of the atonal music I knew. Heard today, it might seem quintessentiallyfifties--a vodka martini set to music, with instrumentation not far from whatyou would hear on a Chet Baker record or, with those bongos, a hi-fi demo. Butat the time, I felt that I had been granted a vision of the musical future. Isat down and wrote a piece for flute, vibraphone, and bongos, to be played asfast as possible. My revelation was not unique. <i>Le Marteau </i>affected composers of severalgenerations, who began to turn out flute-and-vibraphone music by the yard.Because the recording was conducted by Craft, it signaled a laying on of handsby Igor Stravinsky, who lavished praise on <i>Le Marteau </i>and predicted(perhaps ironically) that in twenty-five years Boulez, the enfant terrible ofthe European avant-garde, would be a concert staple. <p>It did not turn out that way. Today the avant-garde is a thing of the past.Boulez, who turned seventy in March, is far more active as a conductor than asa composer. The most recent recording of <i>Le Marteau sans ma&icirc;tre</i>,widely considered the signature piece of the post-Second World War era, hasnever even been reissued on CD, although a forthcoming DGG disc, following aseries of new releases tied to Boulez's birthday, should bring it back intocirculation sometime in 1996. <p>Boulez remains one of the most puzzling figures in the music of our time.Although he composed <i>Le Marteau sans ma&icirc;tre </i>when he was aroundthirty, it turned out to be the beginning of the end of his main creativephase. He has composed little new music over the past twenty years. In the wakeof Boulez's turbulent years at the New York Philharmonic, in the mid-1970s, thewriter Joan Peyser rolled out the Freudian machinery in her book <i>Boulez</i>(1976) and just sounded crass--with her suggestion, for example, that hesuffered from crippling emotional inhibitions as a result of his Catholicupbringing. Today critics are more likely to see Boulez as a victim of his ownvision of musical history. When modernism went out of style, they say, Boulezwas left stranded. Yet the ecstatic reception Boulez receives these days whenhe conducts in Chicago or Vienna--neither city a bastion of modern music, fromwhich Boulez never strays--suggests that Boulez is not so easily consigned tothe historical dustheap. <p>I would propose a different model of Boulez's career: the typical trajectory ofa mathematical genius. Like many mathematicians, Boulez had his great ideas inhis early twenties, when he burst onto the Parisian musical scene as a radicalcomposer and a scathing polemicist who intended to rewrite the history oftwentieth-century music to justify his own innovations. You can hear his brashbrilliance in his very first published work-- the deceptively titled Sonatinefor flute and piano, which Boulez wrote in 1946, a work that was neither smallnor neoclassical. <p>This has to be one of the most original opus No. 1s in the history of music,because it fuses the two warring schools of modern music--those of Stravinskyand Schoenberg. Boulez saw that Stravinsky had revitalized rhythm, whileSchoenberg--and, more important, his pupil Anton Webern--had reconfiguredharmony through the twelve-tone technique. Yet when Boulez composed thesonatina, Stravinsky had apparently ceased his harmonic explorations, andSchoenberg was still using the rhythms of Brahms. Webern, the only composer whomight have shown the way forward, was dead, shot by an American soldier in afreak accident that made him into a martyr for the European left. Why notcombine the progressive elements of the two schools? Hurling Stravinskianrhythms at Schoenbergian harmonies, the young Boulez smashed the musical atom,releasing in the sonatina an explosion of musical violence, nervousness, andinstability.<p>What could he do for an encore? Boulez expanded the style of the flute sonatinain two visionary cantatas based on poetry by the great surrealist Ren&eacute;Char: <i>Le Visage nuptial </i>and <i>Le Soleil des eaux</i>. In his SecondPiano Sonata, written in 1948, at the age of just twenty-three, Boulez feltsufficiently confident of his grand synthesis to take on the very heights ofmusical accomplishment--late Beethoven. The sonata deliberately evokesBeethoven's monumental Hammerklavier Sonata op. 106, and in the recording byMaurizio Pollini the comparison seems almost valid. The sonata was a triumph ofwhat is termed <i>l'audace</i> in French, <i>chutzpah</i> in Yiddish. <p>The rapid development of Boulez's music soon reached its first crisis, however.Around 1950 Boulez befriended two composers who challenged his leadership ofthe avant-garde: Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage. Where Boulez had seen thefuture of music emerging from a crossbreeding of elements from the past,Stockhausen and Cage called for a break with all previous music. Stockhausenreduced music to "information," while Cage refused to differentiate musicalsounds from either noise or silence. Having removed any remaining mystique frommusic, they could impose arbitrary designs on it, including pure chance.Stockhausen wrote a piano piece whose nineteen episodes could be played inwhatever order the performer chose so that no two performances would be thesame. Cage introduced chance into the act of composing itself by letting the<i>I Ching </i>choose his notes for him. Any formal logic in these pieces wouldexist solely in the minds of misguided listeners. <p>Boulez must have felt himself outflanked. His music entered an "experimental"phase, in which he pursued "total serialization," incorporating electronicmusic and elements of chance into a series of works some of which werewithdrawn from performance after "unsuccessful" premieres. While correspondingwith Cage (their letters have now been published), Boulez composed<i>Structures</i>, Book I, for two pianos, a 1952 work in which systematic"pre-composition" takes the place of traditional composition; the convergenceof pitches, rhythmic values, and dynamics is caused by arbitrary ordering. Attimes <i>Structures </i>still sounds like Boulez--it has the edgy violence ofthe earlier music, though the piece gives the listener nothing to hold on toexcept those vestiges of the earlier music. Unlike Boulez's earlier and laterworks, the music of the short-lived experimental phase sounds--judging by thefew remaining recordings--nasty and astringent. But in 1953 Boulez turned againto the poetry of Ren&eacute; Char and began to write <i>Le Marteau sansma&icirc;tre</i>. It was his second grand synthetic "solution," a fusion of hisyouthful style with the speculative structures of Stockhausen and even the"oriental" tinge of Cage. And this time it sounded beautiful. <p>Just after <i>Le Marteau</i>, Boulez began to conduct--often rather shakily. Herehearsed the orchestra and choir for the 1958 Parisian premiere ofStravinsky's <i>Threni</i>, the first completely twelve-tone piece thatStravinsky wrote; the composer himself would be at the podium on the night ofthe performance. It was such a disaster that Stravinsky vowed never to conductin Paris again. Yet by 1963 Boulez could lead a knock-your-socks-off renditionof <i>Le Sacre du printemps</i> that challenged Stravinsky's own. There were asyet no signs that conducting would detract from composing. Boulez was engagedin several major creative projects, in particular <i>Pli selon pli</i>, a hugework for soprano and orchestra, described as a portrait of StephaneMallarm&eacute;. This was clearly intended to be Boulez's masterpiece, but itdisappointed many listeners, Stravinsky among them. <i>Le Marteau sansma&icirc;tre </i>was beautiful; <i>Pli selon pli</i> was just pretty. The musicglittered and shimmered, a little too much like Ravel. The nervous energy ofBoulez's earlier music was missing. In its place was an encyclopedia ofcoloristic subtleties and numerous opportunities for the conductor to displayhis skill through intricacies of rhythm and cueing. Many of Boulez's laterscores are set up as games of tag-you're-it, in which the conductor shapes thepiece within the act of performance. Boulez the composer was serving Boulez themaestro. <p>Figuring everything out at twenty-one can be dangerous. Boulez seemed to betrapped in his initial creative insight, and rather than compose he devotedhimself to conducting the music that had inspired his own precociouscompositions. IT would be tempting to blame the fall of Boulez the composer on the rise ofBoulez the conductor. From the early 1960s on Boulez devoted more and more timeto conducting--first at the British Broadcasting Corporation SymphonyOrchestra, then at the Cleveland Orchestra, and finally at the New YorkPhilharmonic, where he was the controversial music director from 1971 to 1977.He now leads his own <A HREF="http://www.ircam.fr/eic/index.html">EnsembleInterContemporain</A>, in Paris, and guest-conducts the Chicago Symphony, theCleveland Orchestra, and the Vienna Philharmonic.  Even Boulez's conducting career is curious, though. Beginning with his earliestrecordings he restricted himself to a repertory of modernists: Debussy, Ravel,Stravinsky, Bart&oacute;k, Var&egrave;se, Berg, Schoenberg, Webern,Messiaen--many of whose works he has now recorded two or three times. Later headded Wagner and Mahler (and, just this year, some Strauss) to the list, andalso the music of a few of his contemporaries: the Italian Luciano Berio, theHungarian Gy&ouml;rgy Ligeti, the Englishman Harrison Birtwistle, and two oddlycoupled Americans, Elliott Carter and Frank Zappa. This is a large repertory,but it has huge gaps that no other active conductor would allow. Just amongtwentieth-century composers Boulez does not perform Prokofiev, Shostakovich,Britten, Poulenc, or Copland. And despite his highly publicized role as adefender of new music, he has ignored the works of the minimalists andpostmodernists, including Philip Glass, John Co-rigliano, and Alfred Schnittke.<p>Boulez's biases suggest a direct link between the composer and the conductor:heconducts only works that relate to his own creative agenda--works that, as hesays, open up "new terrain." Boulez conducts these pieces as if they were hisown, stripping them of their historical roots. He is interested not inconnecting Mahler with Bruckner (whom he never conducts), or Webern with Brahms(ditto), but rather in showing how Mahler and Webern point the way to Boulez.This may sound narcissistic, but it has enabled Boulez to bring unique insightsto his interpretations. <p>If Boulez's early career can be compared to that of a math genius, in his laterphase he appears to be more a master politician, in the French manner. Havingexhausted his own new terrain by age thirty-five, Boulez has spent the rest ofhis life administering it and erecting monuments, both physical and virtual.The physical monument is <A HREF="http://www.ircam.fr/index-e.html">IRCAM</A>(Institut de Recherche et de Coordination Acoustique Musique), Boulez's personal Kremlin for research and development, atthe Beaubourg, in Paris. The virtual monument is his recorded repertory. <p>IRCAM realizes a very French idea of a think tank-cultural monument: bring thebest and brightest together in a central location, and give them total power.It's either a formula for greatness or a white elephant--the jury is still out.To date, the acoustical research conducted at IRCAM has had little impact onthe music world. <i>R&eacute;pons</i>, a piece Boulez wrote to show off histechnology, toured the United States in 1986 and sounded like just anothertingling and tinselly late-Boulez composition, helped not at all by its tiredelectronic sounds and naive light show. IRCAM has failed to produce a singlemajor new composer, perhaps because, especially in the early years, Boulez keptout the minimalists and postmodernists, the new enfants terribles. (Boulez'sinclusion of Zappa was a halfhearted gesture to the next generation.) Yet theEnsemble InterContemporain has become one of the finest twentieth-centuryensembles in the world, as its recordings of Carter, Ligeti, and Weberndemonstrate. And at IRCAM, Boulez, who has always seemed ill at ease in NewYork, takes on the contented look of the lord of the manor.  BOULEZ'S recordings may have a more lasting significance. They preserve hisdistinctive view of modernism. Modernist music, as <AHREF="http://www.ircam.fr/eic/revendiquer.html">Boulez</A> understandsit, emphasizes color and rhythm rather than the more familiar melody and harmony.Boulez has compared the music of his favorite composers to the paintings ofKlee, Kandinsky, and Mondrian. Reversing a line of Wallace Stevens, Boulezmight say that music is sounds, not feelings. He engages with works that arerich in tone color, and he applies an analytic prism to them, so that everyelement becomes audible. At rehearsals he is notorious for taking apart achord, tuning and balancing every instrument in the orchestra until perfectionis achieved. Even his detractors admit that he has the keenest ear in thebusiness. Boulez can be heard at his best in his new recordings of Debussy's ballet<i>Jeux</i> and Webern's Five Pieces for Orchestra op. 10. Debussy wrote hisscore for a sexually suggestive Nijinsky ballet whose man and two women aredressed for tennis. Debussy was particularly proud of the orchestration, whichevokes both rustling leaves in the twilight and palpitating hearts. He saidthat he wanted the music to sound as if it were "illuminated from behind," andthat the orchestra should be "<i>sans pied</i>"--weightless, in flight. Boulezcaptures these qualities better than anyone else ever has. You can hear everyflickering element in Debussy's complex textures. This new recording is alsothe fastest around; it whirls breathlessly into a violent frenzy when the coyflirtation of the action gets out of control--"<i>sans pied</i>" indeed. <p>It is difficult today to explain to young people the huge impact that Webern'smusic had in the postwar period. After his death his music, previously barelyknown, became the model for the younger generation and also for oldercomposers, such as Stravinsky and Aaron Copland, who were seeking a secondyouth. His style, however, was reduced to predictable clich&eacute;s by hisendless imitators, particularly those of the younger generation. Where he oncehad to be rescued from obscurity, he now has to be saved from the dullingeffects of familiarity, and Boulez's performances do just that. In the magical,minuscule Five Pieces, scored for an orchestra of solo instruments includingguitar, mandolin, harp, harmonium, and cowbells, Webern distilled music intofleeting sparks of color, or distant, barely audible overtones. For somelisteners these fragments may mark the end point of a tradition--the smallestshards remaining from the wreckage of a Mahler symphony. For Boulez, however,they marked a beginning. His performance of the Five Pieces makes them soundlike music for Adam in Eden. Every color glistens, every tiny gesture tingles.The central piece, a litany played against tolling bells, reveals the moment inwhich music brings time to a stop. Listen to these pieces as if they came fromnowhere, as if you had never heard a note of music before in your life, andBoulez will open up a new world for you--as Webern did for him so many yearsago.</blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

On the tin stowed under the upstairs sink<br>

The mule team circulates in silhouette:<br>

Yeoman hand-scrub of workingmen and sons<br>

Going back to before his father was born.<p>





And so he pictures vast bleached dunes<br>

Shimmering to the vanishing point,<br>

The chalky powder heaped in mounds<br>

And hauled to the city by wagon train<p>





To meet demand, a grand procession.<br>

So let tar bleed from telephone poles,<br>

Let engine blocks ooze rainbow slicks<br>

And bike chains jam with caked-up gunk--<p>





He's heard his father say one scoop will cut<br>

Through any crap, no matter what,<br>

Just work the lather good, keep at it.<br>

He's fallen into rhythm now, a little remote,<p>





A little dreamy: the team marches round<br>

The tin like ants, his wrists turn and turn<br>

In a reaming motion, and his head spins<br>

To think of all the pitch-black hands<p>





Squelching away at this dinner hour,<br>

Filling washbasins with oily rivers.<br>

And now his suds froth even darker.<br>

His skin's on fire. He feels certain<p>





The storied mines can't last forever:<br>

The dunes will dwindle into moon dust,<br>

The mules will litter the desert floor<br>

With hollow skulls. He knows in his bones<p>





He's turning into the kind of upstart<br>

Who never misses a chance to flout<br>

A father's orders about what not to touch<br>

Or take apart. In the fogging mirror<p>





He sees himself far older, doubled over<br>

Fiendish smears that won't rinse out<br>

(Some industrial taint? Indelible ink?)<br>

Faithfully, furiously, though he scours.<p>

<p>

I have a young friend in the television business in New York whosejob does not require him to dress for work in the conventional sense; he canwear jeans and T-shirts to produce the promotional spots for his cable channel.But once a week he wears a suit, a fine shirt, and a bow tie. He is more thansix feet tall and in the past three years has gone from shoulder-length hair toa shaved head. The only constant in his appearance is a bow tie, once a week."I hate the grunge look," I tell him. "Why don't you wear a bow tie everyday?"<p>"A bow tie is like a wrapped gift," he tells me. "If I wore one every day, itwouldn't be a treat."<p>	<img src="./art/bow-purp.gif" align=left>I own 147 bow ties. Most of them I bought myself. Some of them have been givento me by friends. Often these gift ties have little lights in them, connectedto batteries that fit in a shirt pocket, and the lights spell out messages likeHAPPY FOURTH OF JULY and REDSOX IN 1999. Or they are decorated with feathers ordesigned to spin around like windmills. Until my junior year in college I worebow ties only to high school proms. These bow ties were always the clip-onvariety. Early in my junior year in college a roommate and I were invited to ablack-tie dinner. My roommate had grown up in New York City, had gone toboarding schools, and had attended numerous coming-out parties on Long Island,in Connecticut, and in the city. When he saw me clipping on my black bow tie,he grabbed it from my hand, threw it on the floor, and jumped up and down on ituntil the clips were broken. "<i>Never</i>," he cried, "wear a clip-on bow tie.<i>Never</i> admit you even <i>know</i> anyone who does." My roommate wassartorially intimidating. He wore straw boaters in the spring. He worewhite-linen suits to class. When he didn't wear braces to hold up his pants, hepulled a silk tie around his waist and knotted it like a belt, just like FredAstaire. Being a successful roommate is like being a successful husband orwife: it's a careful dance. He didn't want to teach me how to tie a bow tie. Hewanted to tie it <i>for</i> me, whenever I was forced into a formal situation.My job was to get him through exams. His only advice for me when we parted was"Remember, tying a bow tie is like tying your shoes in the dark while drunk."<p><font size=5>I</font><font size=3> actually learned to tie a bow tie from a friend of my parents', a friend myfather dismissed as someone who "thinks he's Peter Pan." Mike, my parents'friend, lived in New York. He had gone to Harvard, class of 1928, and spent hisworking life in the retail business as an executive, starting in handbags. Myjunior year in college I used to escape from my family during vacations and staywith Mike and his wife, who always welcomed young people. Mike wrote poetry. Hetook Chinese-cooking courses at a time when Chinese restaurants specialized inegg foo young and brown sauces. He specially painted a wall of his apartment onwhich he projected films of the sea crashing against rocks, so that he could"hold nature to my bosom." He owned a negative-ion machine, which he would turnon when he retired for the night in a pessimistic mood; it would pump outenough good vibrations during his sleep to allow him to awake an optimist. "Abow tie is like the ideal life," Mike told me. "You have to play with it, tweakit, to get it right. Even then, of course, it's always a bit askew. But itshould be." He stood next to me in front of his full-length closet mirror andwalked me through the steps: "Let the ends hang down, left side longer thanright. Left hand over right hand, make a knot, form a bow with the front piece,flip over the back half, search for the little hole . . . and pull the endthrough. Now you fiddle and diddle and decide who you are in the bow-tiespectrum."<p>	<img src="./art/bow-red.gif" align=right>"What do you mean?" I asked Mike, as he undid my tie and signaled me to tryit.<p>"Well," he said, "the little-polka-dot people are generally lawyers,professors, or doctors. Stripes are what these same lawyers, professors, ordoctors wear on weekends--more informal. A tie with a single stripe and littlefigures like animals represents a club--golfing, social, or professional--towhich the wearer belongs. You will be expected to know this and not to inquireas to what these little figures mean." <p>I know that bow-tie people tend to appear cocksure of themselves--people likeProfessor I. B. Cohen, of Harvard; Archibald Cox, of the Watergate hearings;Louis Farrakhan. They are also often short men, like Arthur Schlesinger Jr. andSenator Paul Simon. Mike at the time told me to be careful of short men who arecocksure of themselves. Luckily, I suppose, they often wear bow ties--the deadgiveaway.<p>I practiced my tie-tying back in Boston, thrilled that I could master the artwithout having to give extra points to my old roommate. <p>One of my other roommates that junior year was James MacArthur, Helen Hayes'sson, a man who later played the role of Dano on television's <i>HawaiiFive-O</i>. His mother was about to open in a play on Broadway, <i>TimeRemembered,</i> by Jean Anouilh. Her co-stars were Susan Strasberg, thedaughter of the director Lee Strasberg, and a young Welshman starting hisAmerican career, Richard Burton. The play was having tryouts in Boston, andMacArthur's roommates were invited to opening night and to the cast partyafterward, at the Ritz. I wore my club bow tie, the kind you are not supposedto ask about. At the cast party I haunted Susan Strasberg, knowing that she hadto fall for a Harvard junior with just the right hint of insouciance at hisneck. The more I chased her, the more she chased Richard Burton, escaping meconstantly by jumping onto his lap and burying her head in his neck. Burton wasdrunk, and talking about how he was responsible for the discovery of DylanThomas. I kept trying to butt in to their conversation. At one point Strasbergexcused herself to go to the ladies' room. Burton looked at me as if I were anannoying undergraduate. He pointed a finger at me--or, rather, at my bow tie."Which are you?" he said, in that incredible voice. "A waiter or a clown?" Iflushed my bow tie down the Ritz toilet system and into Boston Harbor, andI heard Helen Hayes tell her son, as I was leaving the party, "He seems likesuch a nice young man . . . so neatly dressed."<p><font size=5>B</font><font size=3>ow ties have been around for more than 300 years, their origin traceable, asone story goes, to the court of Louis XIV of France in the 1600s. The Kingnoticed a company of Croatian soldiers who wore white silk kerchiefs aroundtheir necks. The King apparently loved the look, and appeared at court shortlythereafter with the white kerchief plus some lace and embroidery to heightenthe effect, along with a small bow in front to finish it off.<p>	<img src="./art/bow-grn.gif" align=left>Originally the Croats had wrapped their necks as a charm to guard the areaagainst sword swipes. "Cravat" comes from the French <i>cravates</i>, whichreferred to the Croatian soldiers. Cravats had grown larger and more elaborateby the eighteenth century. Necks were swathed in material that came as high as,and even obscured, the chin and part of the mouth. Stocks--starched-fabriccylinders like neck braces--were fitted around the necks of fashionablegentlemen of these times. These were surrounded in turn by silk or linencravats, held in place by white or black bows. Like women's hemlines, the bowswent up and down according to current fashion, tied sometimes near the chin,sometimes below the Adam's apple. Abraham Lincoln wore black bow ties with hiscollars turned down; English dandies wore smaller bow ties with stiff wingedcollars pointed up. But bows really flourished in the last decades of thenineteenth century. Women in the shirtwaist period, early in this century, woresmaller, neater bows, tied perfectly like shoelaces with ends symmetrical. Atvarious stages since the 1930s bow ties have been so small that they seemedfashioned for dolls or so outrageously large (during the 1960s) that theyseemed grotesque. Alan Flusser, an authority on men's clothing, wrote in 1985,"The general rule of thumb states that bow ties should never be broader thanthe widest part of the neck and should never extend beyond the outside of thepoints of the collar." These rules, like those for almost everything else inlife, were made to be broken.<p> <font size=5>C</font><font size=3>harlie Davidson has been running the Andover Shop, in Cambridge,Massachusetts, like a private club for more than forty years. He taught me thatbuttons are not enough on the cuffs of men's suit jackets: they must beaccompanied by proper buttonholes--buttonholes that work.<p>Charlie is famous for refusing to sell to people who wander into his littleshop and don't measure up under his quick assessment of their taste. In themid-1970s a wealthy businessman came into the store. He had been referred toCharlie. The man ordered three suits, custom made. Charlie took the order andtold the customer they would be ready in "about a month." After five weeks thecustomer, whose last name was Zachary, called to inquire after his suits.<p>"Notquite yet," Charlie said.<p>Another two weeks went by, and Zachary was put off again. Charlie had not madethe suits. "He'll get the message," Charlie told me. "I am not sure I like thecut of his jib."<p>Four weeks more, and Zachary called, irate. "What the hell do you do overthere?" he asked. "Make the clothes alphabetically?" After hearing this line,Charlie made the suits. Zachary had passed the test.<p>Charlie, the arbiter of good taste for Harvard men over many years, does nottrust people who wear bow ties. He says, "George Frazier, the writer who reallypopularized the term 'duende' [extraordinary sense of style], never wore a bowtie. He thought it was a contrived thing, that it made you look like a dandy.Bobby Short, to whom I've sold clothes for years, wears a bow tie only to work.Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. never wore them, and they were thebest-dressed men of their era." I was surprised that Charlie felt this wayabout bow ties, since he was the one who told me over the years not only aboutreal buttonholes on jackets but also that a true gentleman never wears cologne.He stubs out his cigarette with his toe, not his heel. He has a Dopp kit madeof silk, not leather. He stirs his drinks with his finger. Hundreds of Harvardmen have taken these and other Charleyisms to heart.<p>"Give me your rules for the bow tie," I asked.<p>"First of all," Charlie said, "when people ask me if I'm married, I always say,'Yes, but I'm not a fanatic about it.' So here's Number One: Do not wear bowsall the time. Keep the viewer off balance. Wear them once in a while, the wayyou might eat liver.<p>"Number Two: Never wear a bow tie to an interview or a pitch for new business.People will concentrate on the tie rather than on what you are saying.<p>"Number Three: In the men's-clothing business ten percent of tie sales were inbows . . . <i>forever</i>. Today it's fifteen percent or twenty percent, whichis unprecedented. This tells me that there is such ambiguity of roles todaythat men are desperate to assert <i>something</i>.<p>"Number Four: You would be amazed at the practical reasons people wear bows.Doctors have always worn them, because patients can't reach up and yank on themthe way they could with the four-in-hands. Certain men wear them in the summerbecause they eat more salads. Dressing can splash on long ties.<p>"Number Five: Men who wear bow ties care more about themselves than they doabout you."<p>I continue to wear my bow ties, despite the facts that I'm not short, I'm not adoctor, and I do care about other people. I am an incurable romantic, however.I have run with the bulls in Pamplona, and I make sure my bow ties, in Italiansilk, come from Carrot &amp; Gibbs, in Boulder, Colorado. Mike, my New Yorkmentor, used to quote from Conrad Aiken. "The lines always spoke to me ofbows," Mike told me, "so that's how I think of them." On appropriate occasionsI recite them as well:<p>Stars in the purple dusk above the rooftops<br>Pale in a saffron mist and seem to die,<br>And I myself on a swiftly tilting planet<br>Stand before a glass and tie my tie.  <br><p></blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

<blockquote>

<ul>



	<li><a href ="../../issues/96sep/rent/rent.htm">

        Victim Kitsch,</a> September 1996<br>

      With its pop sentimentality, <i>Rent</i> neutralizes avant-garde art into a form that

       hopeful critics take for Broadway's salvation.<p>

       

	<li><a href ="../../issues/96jul/young/young.htm">

        Like Young,</a> July 1996<br>

      Jazz has been attracting its first young audiences in decades -- but are they

       hearing a music without a future?<p>

	

	<li><a href ="../../issues/96jan/bud/bud.htm">

        Bud's Bubble,</a> January 1996<br>

      The seminal bebop pianist Bud Powell absorbed and extended the musical ideas of

      Charlie Parker, Art Tatum, and Thelonious Monk. But his genius was a victim of his

      madness.<p>

		

		<li><a href ="../jazz/Dmanhorn.htm">Man with a 

		Horn,</a> March 1992<br>

              As Stanley Crouch has observed, "Dizzy Gillespie carried and projected the moxie,

              the curiosity, the wit, and the pathos that enliven the world of jazz." Here Francis

              Davis captures the indefatigable vitality of the great bebop trumpeter in an essay

              published a year before Gillespie's death.<p>

              

              <li><a href ="../jazz/Dbetter.htm">Better With Age,</a> 

              September 1991<br>

              At the age of eighty-four, Benny Carter offered audiences "a singular thrill -- the

              chance to look back on history as it continues to unfold." In addition to appreciating

              Carter's longevity, Davis also recognizes Carter's impressive contributions to jazz

              composition.<p>

		

		

		  <li><a href ="../jazz/Dzorn.htm">"Zorn" for "Anger,"</a> 

             January 1991<br>

              "John Zorn is the only musician I've ever considered suing," writes Davis. Despite

              his bad-boy image and the eardrum-shattering volume of his live performances,

              Zorn's contribution to recent avant-garde music, especially his interpretations of film

              music, cannot be dismissed.<p>

              

              <li><a href ="../jazz/Dbook.htm">The Book on Miles,</a> 

             January 1990<br>

              At age sixty-three, Miles Davis, a man fully aware that "his art and life were already

              the stuff of legend," published <i>Miles: The 

              Autobiography</i>. In this review, Francis

              Davis reflects on the life of one of jazz's most important yet

              controversial figures.<p>

              

              <li><a href ="../jazz/Dbird.htm">Bird on Film,</a> 

             November 1988<br>

              In 1988 Clint Eastwood produced and directed <i>Bird</i>, a movie about the life of

              Charlie Parker. Unfortunately, according to Davis, the film "wants to shout 'Bird

              Lives!' but winds up whispering 'Jazz is dead.'"<p>

              

              <li><a href ="../jazz/Dborn.htm">Born Out of Time,</a> 

            April 1988<br>

              In an essay anticipating his July, 1996, essay "Like Young," Davis considered the

              influence of the then twenty-six-year-old trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and the extent of

              his influence on musicians his own age and younger.<p>

		

		<li><a href ="../jazz/Dlgscale.htm">  Large-Scale Jazz,</a> 

            August 1987<br>

              In the 1980s jazz composers were seen as the new innovators, relegating improvisers

              to secondary status. If one accepts the fact that composition was the key element in

              jazz in the 1980s, however, the central figure of the decade was clearly Duke

              Ellington, although he died in 1974.<p>

              

              <li><a href ="../jazz/Dproxy.htm">  Creator by Proxy,</a> 

            February 1987<br>

              Neither an "arranger" (too limited a designation) nor "composer" (too grandiose), Gil

              Evans was more of an improvisational translator. His genius lay in isolating and

              expanding various source materials, such as "a provocative passing chord, an

              insistent rhythmic vamp, or an unexpected melodic ellipsis."<p>

              

              

		<li><a href ="../jazz/Dornette.htm">  Ornette's Permanent Revolution,</a> 

            September 1985<br>

              "All hell broke loose when the alto saxophonist Ornette Coleman made his East Coast

              debut, at the Five Spot Cafe, in Greenwich Village, on November 17, 1959." Davis

              considers the effect of the revolutionary free-jazz movement spawned by Coleman on

              that fateful night.<p>

		

		<li><a href ="../jazz/Dbasie.htm">  The Loss of Count Basie,</a> 

            August 1984<br>

              "Among big-band leaders only Duke Ellinton exerted more long-term influence upon

              jazz and American popular music than Count Basie," observes Davis. Ellington's and

              Basie's styles differed greatly, however -- Ellington was a writer of jazz composition

              whereas Basie functioned more as an editor.<p>

You and I knew what there was to

lose,<br>



waiting on the railway platform like two men.<p>



<p>



Typically you were the brave one, weeping:<br>



blowing your nose into that numb handkerchief<p>



<p>



until I thought your brains would fly out through your face<br>



and you'd stand there holding your mind in both hands,<p>



<p>



relieved and stupefied. My sweetest friend,<br>



at least don't wave it at me when you leave.<p>



<p>



Me, I was angry. Am:<br>



that living in time requires<p>



<p>



this stupid tutorial pain. That God, in God's time,<br>



knows. How could a god feel anything<p>



<p>



for us, except remorseless pity?<br>



But I am jealous:what we are suffering<p>



<p>



is ours, He has<br>



no right to this.<p>





I think it is impossible to think of a god<br>



in any way except as actual. And what good<p>



<p>



would that do two men standing on a platform<br>



in the low cold, the brown sooty wind,<p>



<p>



an empty Sunday evening?<br>



I have pity enough<p>



<p>



for us both, even lacking grace.<br>



For now the god is merely a place<p>



<p>



to put the pity for a little while:<br>



so that we can move when your train arrives<p>



<p>



and pauses, for you to climb up then and go.<br>



Go. I wish you would.<p>

	<font size=5>J</font>AZZ scripture insists that composition is a frill, at best a springboard to

improvisation and at worst an obstruction to it. But jazz scripture also

insists on progress, and in the past few years improvisers have been retracing

their steps and composers have been the ones breaking new ground--writing

formally ambitious works that, while not eschewing improvisation altogether,

relegate it to second place and demand more rigorous self-editing by

improvising soloists. Many of these composers are rejecting jazz's traditional

isolationism to collaborate with poets, choreographers, and classical

musicians. <I>X</I>, the Anthony Davis opera about the life of Malcolm X, presented by

the New York City Opera last fall, is unique only in that it got funded--there

could be other Xs waiting to happen, by Ornette Coleman, Abdullah Ibrahim, and

Henry Threadgill, all of whom have described plans for grand initiatives. Other

contemporary composers who are thinking big--if only in terms of thinking

orchestrally, even when they are able to hire just six or seven

players--include Muhal Richard Abrams, Anthony Braxton, John Carter, Joseph

Jarman, Leroy Jenkins, Steve Lacy, Roscoe Mitchell, Butch Morris, James Newton,

Errol Parker, George Russell, Leo Smith, Cecil Taylor, Edward Wilkerson, the

members of the World Saxophone Quartet (Hamiet Bluiett, Julius Hemphill, Oliver

Lake, and David Murray), and the String Trio of New York (Billy Bang, James

Emery, and John Lindberg). But if one accepts the premise that composition is

the key element in jazz in the 1980s, the decade's central figure is not any of

these but Duke Ellington, who died in 1974.<p>



<p>



Ellington's influence has never been greater. Typed as a "jazz" composer only

by circumstance of race, he spent his career chafing at the restrictions of

jazz, much as his spiritual descendants are chafing now. His scope was

enormous. In addition to ballads even shapelier and riffs even more propulsive

than those expected of a swing-era big-band leader, his portfolio included tone

poems, ballet suites, concerto-like miniatures for star sidemen, sacred music,

topical revues, film scores, and extended jazz works unparalleled until very

recently and classifiable only as modern American music. He even wrote a comic

opera: <I>Queenie Pie</I>, the trifling but winsome score he was working on for public

television at his death, was finally staged last fall in Philadelphia and

Washington. The son of working people, who dared to imagine himself in top hat

and tails, an experimentalist who courted and won popular acceptance, Ellington

was one of America's greatest composers, regardless of idiom. He was also the

most quintessentially American, in the way that he effortlessly negotiated the

distance between popular culture and the fine arts, the dance floor and the

concert hall.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>I</font>N 1984 the Jazz critic Gary Giddins estimated that fifty hours of Ellington

recordings had been released in the ten years following his death. More have

been released since then, including long-forgotten studio sessions and concert

tapes previously circulated only among private collectors. Invaluable as much

of this material has proved to be, it is ironic that it has generally been

easier to come by than Ellington's most acclaimed work--the epochal sides he

recorded for RCA Victor in the early 1940s, for years available only on French

import or by mail order from the Smithsonian Institution.<p>



<p>



The release of <I>Duke Ellington: The Blanton-Webster Band</I> (RCA Bluebird

5659-1-RB29, also available on cassette and compact disc) late last year

indicates that RCA is finally beginning to realize what treasures lie in its

vaults. The four-record set collects the Ellington Orchestra's entire

commercially recorded output from March of 1940 to July of 1942--arguably

Ellington's most fertile period, though most of his large-scale works,

beginning with Black, Brown, and Beige, were still to come. By 1940 most of

Ellington's sidemen had been with him a decade or more, and he had been so

important in shaping their sensibilities that he could almost predict the

content of their improvisations. This familiarity enabled him to take daredevil

risks as a composer and arranger. The two newcomers alluded to in the

collection's title perhaps stimulated him even more. The bassist Jimmy Blanton,

the first jazz virtuoso on his instrument, gave the orchestra's syncopations

more bite, and opened Ellington up as a pianist. The arrival of Ben Webster,

the orchestra's first tenor-saxophone star, gave Ellington another crack

soloist to call on, as well as another color for his palette. (He acquired

still another, more exotic one in late 1940, when Ray Nance, who doubled on

violin, joined the trumpet section.)<p>



<p>



The detail of Ellington's writing and the individuality of his soloists are

always astonishing, no matter how many times one has heard the tracks on <I>The

Blanton-Webster Band</I>. "Concerto for Cootie," with its beautifully integrated

theme and improvisational variations by the trumpeter Cootie Williams, is a

masterpiece. In "Jack the Bear" the dialogues between Blanton and the ensemble

are thrilling. "Ko-Ko" offers intimations of modality and minimalism. The

delight of "Cotton Tail" lies in its breakneck Webster choruses and intricate

sax-section harmonizations. And the layered countermelody of "I've Got It Bad

(And That Ain't Good)" shows off the inspired conjugation of Johnny Hodges's

alto and Ivie Anderson's voice (as perfect a union as that between Lester Young

and Billie Holiday). "Main Stem" and "Harlem Air Shaft" are among the tracks

that show Ellington's ability to experiment even within the confines of the

blues and the thirty-two-bar song format. The numerous versions of pop hits of

the period show Ellington's powers of transformation, and Herb Jeffries's

ungainly warbling proves that even Ellington was human (with the exception of

Ivie Anderson, he never employed a first-rate singer on a regular basis). This

was also the period in which Billy Strayhorn, Ellington's protege, blossomed

into an influential composer and orchestrator under his mentor's watchful eye.

Strayhorn's "Raincheck" and "Johnny Come Lately" anticipate bebop phraseology,

and his "Take the 'A' Train," which ultimately became the Ellington Orchestra's

signature tune, cleverly underlines the band's playful swank. But the most

evocative Strayhorn piece here is "Chelsea Bridge," with its lordly Webster

solo; as a successful jazz appropriation of Ravel and Debussy, this remains

unsurpassed even by Ellington, a master impressionist in his own right.<p>



<p>



It is too bad that the producers of <I>The Blanton-Webster Band</I> failed to include

Ellington's 1941 duets with Blanton, or the small-group dates from the same

period led by Hodges, the clarinetist Barney Bigard, and the trumpeter Rex

Stewart, all featuring Ellington on piano. If it is true, as Strayhorn is said

to have put it, that Ellington's real instrument was the orchestra, it is

equally true that the piano became an orchestra at his urging. (<I>Money Jungle</I>;

on Blue Note BT-85129, a bristling encounter with the modernists Charles Mingus

and Max Roach, recorded in 1962 and reissued last year with other material,

provides a good long look at Ellington the dissonant stride pianist.) Although

the vintage performances on <I>The Blanton-Webster Band</I> have been digitally

remastered, the sound is not as vivid as on the French reissues, nor is the

pitch as accurate. If RCA finally intends to do justice to its Ellington

catalogue, its job is far from over--the Ellington Orchestra recorded

masterpieces for the label before 1940 and after 1942. <I>The Blanton-Webster Band</I>

is a godsend for those on a tight budget; others are advised to search the

specialty shops for French RCA's increasingly difficult-to-find <I>Works of Duke</I>,

twenty-four volumes available separately or in five boxed sets. Still, music

that is timeless and universal in its appeal belongs in chain stores as well as

specialty shops, which is why the reappearance of this material on a

well-distributed domestic label is so welcome.<p>



<p>



In the years since Ellington's death, iconoclastic performers associated with

the jazz avant-garde have recorded albums of his compositions. They have

brought their own agendas to his music, which has proved more malleable than

anyone might have imagined (although there is some justice in the complaints of

those who insist that to play Ellington means playing him his way). The most

striking of these revisionist homages are the flutist James Newton's <I>African

Flower</I> (Blue Note BT-85109), the pianist Ran Blake's <I>Duke Dreams</I> (Soul Note

SN-1027, distributed by Polygram Special Imports), and the World Saxophone

Quartet's <I>World Saxophone Quartet Plays Duke Ellington</I> (Nonesuch 79137-1). This

album is both the most recent and the most satisfying in terms of fealty to

Ellington's tempos and the ineluctable <I>rightness</I> of its deviations from text.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HAT so many performers who are generally adamant about playing only their own

material have chosen to interpret Ellington is eloquent testimony to his

inexhaustible influence, as are the Ellingtonian flourishes (sometimes filtered

through his disciple Charles Mingus) that pervade the ensembles of John Carter,

Abdullah Ibrahim, David Murray, and Henry Threadgill. But when I call Ellington

the key figure of the decade, it's not just because musicians continue to play

his tunes or to aspire to his orchestral majesty. Musicians from all stylistic

camps have long done that much, and Mercer Ellington has done an admirable job

of keeping his father's music in circulation, on albums like the new <I>Digital

Duke</I> (GR1038). Nor is it just because the plungered, speech-like brass styles

like the ones that Bubber Miley, Cootie Williams, Rex Stewart, and Joe Nanton

patented during their years with Ellington are again all the rage, thanks to

the trombonist Craig Harris and the trumpeters Lester Bowie and Olu Dara. Nor

is it because Anthony Davis and many other black composers are consciously, and

in some instances programmatically, giving musical expression to the goals and

frustrations of black society, just as Ellington did with such mural-like works

as <I>Harlem</I>, <I>The Deep South Suite</I>, and <I>Black, Brown, and Beige</I>.<p>



<p>



What is most significant is that today's visionary jazz composers are taking up

Ellington's unfinished task of integrating composition and improvisation. Jazz

is thought of as extemporaneous and fleeting--that is another part of its

romance--but these composers, in setting pen to paper, are aiming for a

perpetuity like that which Ellington achieved. They are realizing larger works,

as he did, and not worrying whether the results strike everyone as jazz.<p>



<p>



Of course, not everyone who listens to jazz is as sanguine about this

development as I am. Some fear that jazz is recklessly heading for the same

dead end that classical music arrived at earlier in this century, with

atonality and serialism. And it is true that the composers I am speaking of as

Ellington's heirs lack his common touch, his willingness to play the role of

entertainer, and will probably never find themselves in a position to develop

this commendable trait. Jazz has experienced growing pains since Ellington's

time, and the innocent idea of entertainment has been forced to submit to the

cynical science of demographics (it's a question not of what is entertaining

but of how many and whom it entertains). In its maturity--some would say its

dotage--jazz has become an art music, and because a reconciliation with pop

seems out of the question, a rapprochement with classical music is probably the

key to its survival. Ellington gives these contemporary composers much to

strive for, but his mass appeal is sadly out of their reach. A larger audience

should be part of what a composer dares to hope for when he starts thinking

big.<p>

The tribes may at any time reclaim inventoried items of cultural andritual importance. Tens of thousands of artifacts stand to be returned, andmany kinds of objects that are often displayed --pipes, medicine bundles, andmasks among them--will cease to be exhibited unless tribes consent. However,the majority of holdings, consisting of everyday items such as clothing andpottery, will not be affected. <br clear=all><h4>Health&amp; Safety</a></h4>November <strong>1</strong>, New York City's sidewalks may be even denser with smokers after	<img src="./art/alm-hlth.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>today, when employers must post a smoking policy. The requirement is part ofthe city's Smoke-Free Air Act, adopted last April and designed to limitexposure to secondhand smoke. It affects all employers and will serve to bansmoking in most parts of the workplace, including lounges, restrooms,cafeterias, and company vehicles. Unlike the hundreds of U.S. cities and townsthat have wholly eliminated smoking in the workplace, however, New York stillpermits smoking behind closed doors in private offices--so long as no more thanthree people, all consenting, are present--and in ventilated smoking rooms.These provisions have raised the ire of the anti-smoking lobby, which contendsthat they unfairly accommodate the habits of superiors, who are more likely tohave private offices, and the interests of the world's three largesttobacco-producing companies, RJR Nabisco, Philip Morris, and Loews, which areall headquartered in Manhattan. <br clear=all><h4>Food</a></h4>November <strong>10</strong>, starting today all foods regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture--that	<img src="./art/alm-food.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10> is, all meat and poultry products--that bear the word"healthy" or any of its derivatives on their labels must meet a new definitionof the word constructed by the department and the Food and Drug Administration.(All foods regulated by the FDA must comply by January 1.) "Healthy" foodscannot exceed specified amounts of fat, saturated fat, sodium, and cholesterolper serving, and they must contain at least 10 percent of the recommended dailyvalue of vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, or fiber--a stipulationthat will rule out some items, such as some fruit juices, that are generallyconsidered appropriate to a balanced diet. The joint definition is an effort toassure consumers of consistency; however, the FDA will allow a broader use ofthe word "healthy" in some instances, such as in a product's name, as long asit is not linked to specific nutritive content and is not grossly misleading.<br clear=all><h4>Q&amp;A</a></h4><i>The likelihood that a given thing will happen--for example, that one will fall victim to a terrorist attack 	<img src="./art/alm-qa.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>or win the lottery--is often measured againstthe odds of being struck by lightning. What actually are those odds?</i><p>According to the Statistical Assessment Service, in Washington, D.C., mediaestimates of the chance of being struck by lightning range from a comfortableone in five million to a somewhat disconcerting one in 10,456. Dividing thepopulation of the United States in a given year (248,709,873 in 1990) by thenumber of people killed by lightning (89) gives odds of one in 2.8 million. Butthis figure doesn't mean much, because some regions have more lightning thanothers, and individual behavior is also a factor. Defying all odds, howeverimprecise, is Roy Sullivan, a forest ranger who survived a world-record sevenlightning strikes.<br clear=all><h4>TheSkies</a></h4>November <strong>7</strong>, Full Moon, also known as the Beaver, Frosty, or Falling Leaves Moon. <strong>17</strong>,	<img src="./art/alm-sky.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10> the best time to observe the Leonid meteors comes just beforemidnight. This shower, although variable in intensity, has produced somespectacular displays, including, in 1966, an outburst that reached the rate ofsome 144,000 meteors an hour--the heaviest in recorded history. <strong>18</strong>,Venus, Mars, and Jupiter gather low in the southwest just after sunset, joinedNovember <strong>23</strong> by the crescent Moon.  <br clear=all><h4>Government</a></h4>November <strong>7</strong>, the first 1996 presidential primary of sorts will be held today. Atleast 20 cities, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Newark, Pasadena, and Tucson,and Spokane County, Washington, will participate in CityVote, a nonbinding"presidential preference balloting" open to all voters regardless of theirparty affiliation. The project is headed by Larry Agran, a former mayor ofIrvine, California, and a 1992 Democratic presidential candidate; its goal isto prompt candidates to address urban concerns earlier and more substantivelythan they have done in the past. The composition of the ballots will bedetermined by CityVote and city officials; undeclared as well as declaredcandidates are likely to be included. <br clear=all><h4>125 Years Ago</a></h4>Thomas Wentworth Higginson, writing in the November, 1870, issue of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>: "It 	<img src="./art/alm-yrs.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>is the charm of pedestrian journeys that they convertthe grandest avenues to footpaths. Through them alone we gain intimateknowledge of the people, and of nature, and indeed of ourselves. It is easy tohurry too fast for our best reflections, which, as the old monk said ofperfection, must not be sought by flying, but by walking. . . . The thoughtsthat the railway affords us are dusty thoughts; we ask the news, read thejournals, question our neighbor, and wish to know what is going on, because weare a part of it. It is only in the footpath that our minds, like our bodies,move slowly, and we traverse thought, like space, with a patient thoroughness."</blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

<b><i><font size=4>A veteran of

nearly twenty years of successful writing for stage and radio, Arnold 

Sundgaard describes himself as a "journeyman writer." He began his career with the

Federal Theater and with Writers' Projects in Chicago and New Orleans, and has

since devoted himself principally to libretti and musical plays. In spare

moments he has written a book, The Miracle of Growth, taught at three

universities and a college, and worked with Leonard Bernstein on the Omnibus

program about Beethoven. His work includes Everywhere I Roam, in collaboration

with Marc Connelly; Down in the Valley, with Kurt Weill; three operas with Alec

Wilder; and a jazz opera (composer unannounced) currently in progress. His

long, close association with contemporary music well qualifies Mr. Sundgaard to

discuss the position of jazz in 1955.</i></b></font>

	<font size=5>I</font>N the record catalogues jazz has a place of its own. It follows "Popular

Music," which is a vastly longer list. You will find in the jazz section, just

as in the folk division, no mention of composers as such. The names of Arlen,

Berlin, Carmichael, Gershwin are omitted. Instead you will find the names of

Armstrong, Basie, Condon, Dodds, Eldridge, Freeman, Getz--the men who make the

stuff. These craftsmen are themselves composers in that they possess the

remarkable gift of spontaneously scoring music as a group.<p>



<p>



A song of itself is not jazz, no matter what its origin. Jazz is what the

jazzmen searching together bring to it, take from it, find within it.

Spirituals, blues, stomps, ragtime, quadrilles, folk ballads, popular

songs--all these and more are the subjects of their creative scrutiny. Even the

most sensitive and skilled of jazz arrangers like Duke Ellington and Ralph

Burns cannot put down all that is actually played. Much is left free for

improvisation, and no precise method of notation has been developed to indicate

its rhythmic and emotional complexities. In most cases no formal score whatever

is followed. The song and its arrangement become for these men a means to an

end. The music used, in other words, is somewhat incidental to the inspired

uses to which it is put. For this reason jazz, within the realm of music,

thrives on endless exploration and ceaseless discovery.<p>



<p>



Coming, as it frequently does, as an outcry of a hurt suppressed or an

exuberance released, jazz strives to speak for and to the individual. Because

of this the group through which it speaks and from whom it must find its

support is seldom a large one. As Henry "Red" Allen said one night, "If you got

too many up there at once you start to get in each other's way!" So here are

voices speaking alone, speaking personally, yet drawing strength and deriving

character from the group. The "combo," as it is called, becomes almost a term

of affection. The word has been cut down from "combination," which means "a

union or aggregate made by combining persons or things together so as to effect

a purpose." While intended originally to describe restraint of trade, it could

serve quite easily as a description of love. And, like love, the playing of

jazz is one of the few rituals which permit such a feeling of shared joy, one

of the few arts in which creation and performance are simultaneous.<p>



<p>



Jazz, by its very nature, is a kind of freedom rooted in the sense of

responsibility. Each soloist is guaranteed unrestricted freedom but he must

exercise this privilege always with the other men in mind. Between them they

possess and treasure a common rhythm supporting a community of sounds out of

which the single voice is sustained and strengthened. A symphonic performance,

somewhat in contrast, demands a rigid control by composer and conductor; a

discipline in which the musicians expect and are expected to submit to an

outside will. (Imagine the pandemonium if the second trumpet of the Boston

Symphony suddenly stood up and took a few riffs on his own!) But in a jazz

group the total effect is the result of total contribution. The music exists

without a strong central authority. Perhaps this sounds dangerously close to

the classical hope for anarchism. In a sense it is exactly that, and in its

less skilled practitioners the result is indeed anarchy. When functioning at

its best, however, there is unbelievable order as each performer gives and is

given, as he sends and is sent. This responsibility does not begin and end with

the performers. In contrast to an alarmingly large body of contemporary music,

jazz expects to be listened to. It does not pretend to be soporific even when

accused of being an aphrodisiac.<p>



<p>



Jazzmen are a proud and independent lot; they refuse to conceal themselves

behind a potted palm. While great moments of jazz can be recorded, remembered,

and even revered, the art itself cannot be wrapped, stamped, and packaged like

dehydrated noodles. On the contrary, active participation here and now is the

very lifeblood of its existence. "The most inventive improvisation comes only

when the conditions are compelling," Gerry Mulligan has stated. And the

remarkable thing about jazzmen is that if nobody else will listen to them they

will play for themselves. Hence the jam session in its original meaning. Hence

the obsessive faith in their own striving. Hence the disdain of a commercialism

which seeks--and they know it--to standardize, to stabilize, and ultimately to

crush this lonely, loving art.<p>





<p>



<font size=5>H</font>ISTORICALLY the journey that jazz has taken can be traced with reasonable

accuracy. That it ripened most fully in the redolence of New Orleans seems

beyond dispute although there are a few deviationists who support other

theories of its origin. Around 1895 the almost legendary Buddy Bolden and Bunk

Johnson were blowing their cornets in the street and in the funeral parades

which have always enlivened the flamboyant social life of that uncommonly vital

city. At the same time, it must be remembered, Scott Joplin was producing

ragtime on his piano at the Maple Leaf Club in Sedalia, Missouri; and in

Memphis, W. C. Handy was evolving his own spectacular conception of the

blues.<p>



<p>



Jazz in its beginnings, however, relied more on a variety of traditional

ballads and songs than it did on new compositions. "Tiger Rag," for example, is

an inspired lift from an old quadrille, evidences of which still cling to the

notes. Most of the music grew out of fertile memories and atavistic impulses

rather than out of conscious study. "Head music" they still call it, and one of

the reasons Bunk Johnson joined Buddy Bolden's band was that he didn't have to

read notes in that organization. Even to this day there are jazzmen who are

reluctant to admit they can read music, because of the stigma which adheres to

the conservatory-trained professionals.<p>



<p>



Exactly why jazz developed the way it did on the streets of New Orleans is

difficult to determine even though a spate of explanations have poured forth

from the scholars of the subject. Obviously the need for it there was coupled

with the talent to produce it and a favorable audience to receive it. During

those early years the local urge for musical expression was so powerful that

anything that could be twanged, strummed, beaten, blown, or stroked was likely

to be exploited for its musical usefulness. For a long time the washboard was a

highly respected percussion instrument, and the nimble, thimbled fingers of

Baby Dodds showed sheer genius on that workaday, washday utensil.<p>



<p>



Also in New Orleans there was the lively tradition of the "second line" at

street parades, which was made up of eager youngsters imitating the elite among

the adult performers. Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory, Omer Simeon, Wingy Manone,

George Lewis, Barney Bigard--all of whom are abundantly alive and still playing

with the vigor of youngsters--were graduates of the "second line." There was a

truly intense rivalry between the various burial and marching societies and all

took great pride in their musical prowess. And then, as a final environmental

fillip, in the area known as Storyville there was as fine a group of brothels

as any city ever boasted, and the managers of these mansions were absolutely

without prejudice toward any form of art which would enhance the sense of

elation among their patrons. As Jelly Roll Morton said of the district,

"everything in the way of hilarity" was sought and sold there. There are those

who still look askance at jazz because it was partially a product of this and

other Bacchanalian playgrounds. But to condemn jazz for that reason is as

foolish as it would be to destroy a Greek vase because of the presence of

Silenus blatantly pursuing the maidens across a Grecian meadow.<p>



<p>



This favorable situation of responsive patron and stimulated performer allowed

the new music to thrive. One thing seems apparent in the development of the

style which it evolved: the Negro bandsmen (and those influenced by them) seem

to have applied their own special vocal technique and feelings to the

instruments which fell into their capable hands. Spirituals and blues were an

integral part of their heritage, and both forms of lament take on a strong,

driving quality when sung by Negroes without the debilitating effects of formal

musical training. As they sang, so they played. Fused to this tradition of

singing there was the equally profound effect of the "stomp," which grew out of

their own primitive folk dances. These were the racial colors and local

textures, Creole and working class amalgams, applied to the new music, and it

is logical to assume there would be no abrupt change in feeling simply because

of the acquisition of cornets, clarinets, "trambones," violins, and tubas. That

the vocal and instrumental styles were similar is still evident in the

musicianship of Louis Armstrong, whose voice and trumpet employ the same basic

style of jazz phrasing.<p>



<p>



When Storyville closed down in 1917 under the inexorable pressure of history,

the musicians of New Orleans began to wander under the pressure of economic

necessity. The easiest and most convenient mode of exodus was by riverboat, on

which some of them had already begun to play under Fate Marable, an early

bandsman who specialized in dance music for the Mississippi voyagers. Around

each bend in the river these musicians encountered fresh approval for their

form of music. Some of them lingered for a time in Memphis and St. Louis but it

was in the favorable climate of Chicago that most of them became most firmly

established. There in the South Side they found a home which possessed certain

essences comparable to those of the French Quarter in New Orleans.<p>



<p>



The story of the twenties in Chicago is almost too familiar to need repeating

here. What seems pertinent is to observe that jazz, once dispossessed,

gravitated toward a particular kind of environment in which its existence was

not only possible but, seen in retrospect, probable. The South Side of Chicago

during the twenties was Storyville on a much larger scale, and because of this

the New Orleans music continued an unbroken development there.<p>



<p>



The first real threat to the inner strength and natural development of jazz

came in the thirties with the depression and repeal. These twin pressures

provided, for the first time, a completely new set of circumstances with which

the music had to contend. There was now a second exodus, this time away from

gin-mills and steady employment. In one sense the music was, as it had never

been before, homeless. In another sense its home was everywhere. Fragmentation

set in and the musicians were scattered like the other uprooted families of the

period. Some of them found a subsistence employment playing rent party

music--"pitchin' boogie" it always had been called--and there was a brisk

revival of boogie-woogie, which had languished during the twenties. Little of

it is heard today; it was at its best on a battered upright piano with the

landlord howling outside the door and the tenants howling within. Whether

boogie-woogie was the victim of rent controls, low-cost housing projects, or a

change in musical taste is hard to say. All that remains is warm memories of

Jimmy Yancey, Pine Top Smith, and Cow Cow Davenport assisting in raising the

rent through song and a communal effort.<p>



<p>



The most sensationally successful of all jazz derivatives was swing, which

thrived in the late thirties. Here was a music that could be danced to with

zest and listened to with pleasure. (That it provided its younger auditors with

heroes such as Shaw, Sinatra, and Goodman is more of a sociological enigma than

a musical phenomenon.) But swing lost its strength and vitality by allowing

itself to become a captive of forces concerned only with how it could be sold;

not how it could be enriched. Over and over it becomes apparent that jazz

cannot be sold even when its practitioners can be bought. Like truth it is a

spiritual force, not a material commodity.<p>



<p>



During the closing years of World War II, jazz, groping for a fresh expression,

erupted into bop. Bop was a wildly introverted style developed out of a certain

intellectualism and not a little neuroticism. By now the younger men coming

into jazz carried with them a GI subsidized education and they were breezily

familiar with the atonalities of Sch&ouml;nberg, Bartok, Berg, and the

contemporary schools of music. The challenge of riding out into the wide blue

yonder on a twelve-tone row was more than they could resist. Some of them have

never returned. Just as the early men in New Orleans didn't know what the

established range of their instruments was, so these new musicians struck out

in directions which might have been untouched had they observed the academic

dicta adhering even to so free a form as jazz.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>S</font>INCE the heyday of bop, recent though it may seem to some, further

fragmentation has developed into what is referred to as "progressive." These

are the younger men, most of them still in their twenties, playing today. The

occasional designation for them as "cool" is merely a subheading for

conversational and record-blurb convenience. The term means little except that

it suggests a certain control and lack of frenzy. The music in this stage of

its evolution is inclined to be contemplative and introspective. In performance

and as a person Chet Baker, for instance, is completely without any of the

effusive histrionics or gregariousness of a Fats Waller or a Charlie Shavers;

the quiet mastery of mood and meaning emerging from his incredible trumpet

tends to command a hushed, almost reverent respect for the statement within

him.<p>



<p>



The progression implied in the term "progressive" has been twofold. For the

musician there has been a phenomenal advance beyond the rigid rhythmic and

harmonic limitations of the older music. Some of this is so striking that the

leader of a small dance band, listening to Lee Konitz and Gerry Mulligan for

the first time, cried out, "They knock me out, those kids. Where do they get

those frantic chords?" For the listener to this music there has been an

advance, or at least a change from the old bar and bedroom atmosphere to the

trappings and flavor of a Student Union recital lounge.<p>



<p>



One of the cashiers at the Basin Street in New York City, mourning over the

sedateness of the clientele, said, "Mothers bring their children to hear the

first few sets each night when these guys play. That's why we got a few rows of

chairs as well as tables. You'd think it was Town Hall or something!" And it is

true--the quality of the applause is strikingly similar to that of Town Hall

and the intent faces could be transferred to the Rathskeller at the University

of Wisconsin or the Lion's Den at Columbia and nobody would notice the

difference. "In the old days," the cashier continued, "they used to say the

music was so loud you couldn't hear yourself talk. Now they get sore if you

even whisper!" A strange, new audience, no question of that--they listen as

avidly to Oscar Peterson as they listen to the Bach Aria Group.<p>



<p>



Some of the music now being developed seems valid, warm, and forceful as in the

case of Mulligan; some of it borders on the self-conscious and seems coldly

intellectual as in the case of Brubeck. The brilliant performance and

startlingly original arrangements of Mulligan have won the admiration and

respect of such established professionals as Benny Goodman and Alec Wilder.

Brubeck has been acclaimed by college audiences from one jumping campus to the

next. Both Mulligan and Brubeck, along with an increasing number of others,

seem to be evolving an art form out of jazz in which the musically trained mind

will be able to bring to his work the exhilarating innocence and freedom of

folk expression. Not that either performer (and others with similar

backgrounds) is "folk" in the older sense of the word; both are too

sophisticated for that. But they seem to sense the necessity of speaking the

jazz idiom out of their own convictions.<p>



<p>



The question inevitably arises: Which of all these forces is truly jazz? It is

a little like asking: What is art? The answers, now found in many languages,

are numerous and various.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE shelf on jazz in the music room of the New York Public Library fairly

bulges with volumes in French, German, and Italian. It seems strange to read in

German a book called the Jazzlexicon in which you will find scholarly resumes

of such eminent jazzmen as Dizzy Gillespie and Cozy Cole. And there are

currently in the releases of several record companies examples of jazz as

played in Denmark, Sweden, and Australia. Obviously the form and style are no

longer limited to our own country. And jazz, as a youthful form of art, is

listened to as avidly in London as in Palo Alto or Ann Arbor.<p>



<p>



The musicians now entering the field of jazz are invariably more educated in

formal music than were the contemporaries of King Oliver and Jack Laine. There

is no escaping the force of history even at the cost of a pristine folk

expression. There are those who long for a return to Dixieland, believing that

the sounds produced there are evidence of a True Church. But no art can be

completely restored by the archaeologists who uncover it; they only can point

out where and when corruption began.<p>

Let us try to recall the beginnings of jazz. The form around which much of the

early music developed, the blues, was a simple twelve-bar phrase. It was the

very essence of simplicity. Not that the blues were or should be the limits of

jazz possibility, but an examination of their treatment may indicate how a song

lends itself to improvisation and stylistic freedom. One of the oldest, and so

described affectionately by Jelly Roll Morton, is "Mamie's Blues," which

begins:--<p>



<p>



    

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Two nineteen done took my baby away,<br>



Two nineteen took my babe away,<br>



Two seventeen gonna bring her back some day.<br>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





<p>



Within those three simple lines is compressed all the Odyssean anguish

necessary for musical exploration. There is no need here for involved rhyming

and qualifying clauses--that is the function of the music. Let the trumpet

state what departure means and the clarinet will describe what being alone

means. Let the trombone tell how long it is between departure and return and

then all three, supported by string bass, drums, guitar, or banjo, will find a

way to say that hope exists and will survive the agony of separation.<p>



<p>



Does this seem too simple an explanation? Then how explain the richness of

emotion and variety of expression which emerge from such a simple song when

played by skilled jazzmen? Are not these words the materials of their special

poetry?<p>



<p>



<PRE>

     When I saw you this morning, baby,

       why did you walk away?

     When I saw you this morning, baby,

       why did you walk away?

     Can't believe that you don't want me,

     I thought our love was here to stay.

</PRE>





<p>



In order to amplify and enlarge the impact of such a simple yet fecund idea the

musicians have, from time to time, tried to enlarge the scope of their

instruments and the intricacies of their arrangements. It would seem sometimes

that they wanted to get more out of their horns than was mechanically possible;

just as it has seemed sometimes that they tried to get more out of life than

was humanly possible. About many jazzmen one feels the urgency in them to live,

and to live at the outermost limits of human possibility. This urgency seems

unwise to the cautious of this world and disheartening to the vanquished. To

many others, accustomed to a less oblique conception of living, it is a little

like mountain climbing and the pursuit of white whales in that its suppression

is impossible and its explanation difficult.<p>



<p>



For the younger progressives of jazz, the exploitation of the blues has been

done so thoroughly and well by the older men that they feel the necessity to

look elsewhere for their musical source material. The rigidity of the mellowed

blues form and its strict chord structure doesn't permit them sufficient

freedom for the development of their present ideas. They hold the blues in high

regard and realize that if the pattern is changed they are no longer the blues.

It is like adding a fifth line to a quatrain; it may be a poem but definitely

it is not a quatrain. In other cases, as in a song like "Sweet Georgia Brown,"

the melodic line seems to have been developed directly out of the progression

of chords which in turn dictate, more or less, the harmony. The popular songs

of Kern or Rodgers or Porter offer more challenges and freedom, both

rhythmically and harmonically, and almost all the men beyond the stream of

Dixie work with this as material instead of the older pieces. In many cases new

music, none of it with words, is being written which will provide the musical

challenges their virtuosity suggests to them.<p>



<p>



The driving force behind all jazzmen is somewhat the same and the search for

fresh and vivid expression is the basis of musical growth. When asked why he

played the way he did a member of one of the younger groups said, "I guess it's

the only way I can talk the way I feel. I mean what I've got to say I can say

best this way." When asked, "Hell, what is it you want to say?" he looked far

in the distance, then tried to answer. He took seriously the fact that words

are not the only means of man's expression and if he wished to be heard fully

he would have to seek another kind of voice. But what he seemed to be saying

with the evanescent words of his music--in this case he spoke through a

trumpet--was that life is ephemeral and let us make the most of it. Poets have

suggested, too, as he was doing with his music that there is joy to be found in

the human situation as well as an inescapable sadness. Is it any wonder that a

serious concern for this complex of emotion should drive a verbally

inarticulate man to the bosom of his music?<p>



<p>



For a youth in search of identification, the urgency to life, which he finds in

jazz, becomes a vital symbol of hope and extramundane aspiration. A parent may

look on in horror at what he considers the baser aspects of this music. And

there is no denying that with a force so delicately powerful somebody will

cunningly try to mix in with it an element of fraud and deceit. But this calls

for honesty, discernment, and understanding rather than suppression, because

jazz, like the existence of blood and bone and flesh, is an affirmation of life

and should be permitted the freedom to find its own true voice and not be

shamed into silence.<p>



<p>



Since the time of New Orleans, jazz has run the gamut from simplicity to

complexity. Life, it has been observed, has run a similar course. If jazz is a

reflection of life, as it seems to be, why then has it aroused such antagonism

among many people? First, I think, because it challenges complacency. Secondly,

because it refuses to be bridled by the accepted and equivocal standards of

society. Thirdly, because it is never still; it does not hesitate to press

forward on every boundary of the emotions no matter how they may be denied. But

most of all it has tried to speak without guile or circumvention to the

troubled mind and bewildered heart. As long as doubt and loneliness exist this

music will try to speak to them. There will always be people who do not wish to

listen; to them the music is disturbing and they either deny the existence of

bewilderment or they wish to escape its deeper meaning. But disturbances of the

mind and heart cannot be quieted by logic or quelled by ridicule. As long as

this is true, jazz--as a voice from within--will find expression and survive.<p>

Again and again she ignoresthe tut-tutting of her friends and hurls herself at some mysterious stranger:JFK, McGovern, Carter, Dukakis, Clinton. Think of the <A HREF="http://www.umr.edu/~sears/primary/">Republican Party</A> as theDemocrats' serious-minded sister. In all but one of the past nine elections shehas opted for her highest-ranking or most senior leader: Nixon in 1960, 1968,and 1972; Ford, Reagan, Reagan, Bush, Bush. To find an election in which theparty rejected its heir apparent in favor of an insurgent, one has to look allthe way back to 1964, when the draft-Goldwater movement knocked aside NelsonRockefeller, the multi-millionaire governor of New York State.<p> This year three men--<A HREF="http://www.gramm96.org/">Phil Gramm</A>, <A HREF="http://www.umr.edu/~sears/primary/wilson.html">Pete Wilson</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.Nashville.Net/~lamar/">Lamar Alexander</A>--entertainserious hopes of besting 1996's Republican heir apparent, <A HREF="http://homepage.seas.upenn.edu/~lapple/bobdole.nscape.html">Bob Dole</A>. Gramm andWilson can at least claim some heir-apparent legitimacy of their own--Grammas the Senate's Mr. Conservative, Wilson as the governor of the largest statein the nation. Lamar Alexander, however, stands way, way back in the Republicanqueue. His r&eacute;sum&eacute; (two-term governor of Tennessee, Secretary ofEducation under George Bush), while creditable, ought to push him down amongthe <A HREF="http://www.iquest.net/lugar/lugar.html">Dick Lugars</A> and <A HREF="http://bizserve.com/specter/">Arlen Specters</A> and other no-hopers. But for all his lack ofreputation, Alexander is running a big-time campaign. <p>By the end of the June filing period he had raised $7.6 million, less than BobDole's $13.4 million, but a considerable amount of money by anybody'sdefinition. Six of the past eight Republican National Committee financechairmen have joined his campaign. Alexander has signed up the most brilliantof Republican media men, Mike Murphy; some of the cleverest of the Washingtonpolicy wonks; Pete Wilson's onetime biggest donor; and the man who chaired BobDole's 1988 New Hampshire campaign. The strategists of the Alexander campaigninsist that it is precisely because their man is <i>not</i> the heir apparent that he can incarnatethe populist, anti-Washington political passions of the 1990s. They intend,they say, to run an insurgency campaign, very like the campaigns that nominatedBarry Goldwater in 1964 and Jimmy Carter in 1976 and nearly nominated Gary Hartin 1984. <p>But there remains one difference: the Goldwater, Carter, and Hart campaignsdrew their strength from the enthusiasm of previously disorganized votingblocs. Goldwater excited the nascent conservative movement, Carter mobilizedevangelical voters, and Hart appealed to upper-income Democrats who leaned tothe right of their party economically and to the left of it on social issues.It is not, however, <i>voter</i> excitement that fuels the Alexander campaign.Alexander boasts nothing like the network of militants who seized theRepublican nomination for Goldwater. His campaign is a phalanx of Republicandonors and campaign operatives--an army of generals and colonels. For allAlexander's attacks on out-of-touch political elites, it's hard to remember aRepublican candidacy that has gambled so completely on the power andpersuasiveness of those same elites. And Alexander's ability to persist in thecontest with hardly any popular support--to go on paying the exorbitant costsof a first-tier presidential campaign despite his four-percent showing in thepolls--demonstrates that some people believe the gamble may not be an entirelymisconceived one.<p>But then, what choice has Alexander got? In an excess of irony, twenty years ofpolitical reforms intended to minimize the influence of wealthy donors andmaximize popular participation in the nominating process have achievedprecisely the opposite result. Increasingly, the crucial primary does not occurin any one particular state: it is a shadowy national competition to raisemoney, sign up prominent supporters, and impress the media in the yearpreceding the election year. It is this "elite primary" that winnowed out JackKemp, Dick Cheney, and other Republican aspirants. <p>The more ingenious Alexander, in contrast, has brilliantly turned the system tohis own advantage. The Tennessee law firm headed by the former senator HowardBaker is cheerfully paying him a salary of $295,000 for the services he canspare it in the intervals between full-time campaigning. (That sum lands with agratifying smack atop the $3 million to $6 million fortune that--as LisaSchiffren reported in the September <i>American Spectator</i>--generous friendshelped Alexander accumulate with hardly any money down.) And it is his successin the elite primary that has marked Lamar Alexander as a serious candidate in1996, despite his near-total invisibility among the Republican rank and file.<p><p><br><p><br>Materialist explanations of history have, for obvious reasons, fallen out offashion recently. Nevertheless, it is two hard material facts that shape thesystem of presidential-candidate selection: the primary schedule and thecampaign-finance laws. <p>As late as 1968 fewer than half the voting delegates at the national partyconventions were chosen by primary voters. That year Robert F. Kennedy wonevery primary he entered except Oregon's, but had he lived, he almost certainlywould have lost the Democratic nomination to the favorite of the party leaders,Vice President Hubert Humphrey. <p>Selection by party leaders was not to happen again. The late 1960s and early1970s were a time of immense suspicion of traditional elites and hierarchies,and in those years state after state abandoned the caucus or convention methodof delegate selection in favor of the primary. By 1972 a majority of those ableto cast a ballot at a national convention had been elected in a state primaryand arrived pledged to a candidate. But the two parties did not immediatelydigest the logic of the primary system, because for years it appeared thatlittle had changed--the nomination fight proceeded at the leisurely pace of theearly years of the century, beginning in Iowa in the dead of winter, arrivingin the big midwestern states in the spring, and culminating in California inearly June. <p>The first candidate to understand the implications of imposing a new method ofpicking delegates upon the old schedule was Jimmy Carter. He realized that bypainstakingly working the state of Iowa for months, almost as if he wererunning for governor, he could post a surprisingly strong showing in thatstate. His win there transformed him into a national figure, enabling him toraise money to fight the big, costly primaries later in the year. George Bushcopied the Carter method in 1980, and though he didn't win the Republicannomination, he did promote himself from being a relatively inconsequentialpolitician into the vice presidency.<p>But the Carter method hasn't worked since. In the mid-1980s the leisurelyschedule inherited from the bygone days of caucuses and state conventions beganto be compressed. Anxious to pull their party in a more conservative direction,southern Democrats grouped their 1988 primaries together in one "SuperTuesday." With hundreds of delegates from the nation's most conservative statesup for grabs on a single day in March, relatively early in the primary season,aspirants would, it was hoped, adopt a new, right-leaning political argot. Atfirst the plan backfired--with Richard Gephardt, Al Gore, and Michael Dukakisdividing the white vote, the surprise beneficiary of the first Super Tuesdaywas Jesse Jackson--but it did succeed in cramping the hopes of Carter-styleinsurgents by denying them time to capitalize on early successes in the smallstates. In 1988 Bob Dole and Pat Robertson relegated George Bush to ahumiliating third-place finish in Iowa, to no avail. In 1992 Pat Buchanan'sprimary challenge to President Bush soon fizzled out, despite an impressive 37percent finish in New Hampshire.<p>It is only in the past two years, however, that the primary system has reachedits full logical conclusion. Why, state party officials in places like Arizonaand Delaware wondered, should Iowa and <A HREF="http://www.fosters.com/FOSTERS/cgi-bin/walk.cgi/FOSTERS/info/d1/">New Hampshire</A> call the tune? <i>We wantto be relevant</i>. And why, officeholders in giant states like California andOhio asked in their turn, should dinky states like Arizona and Delaware takecontrol of the nomination from Iowa and New Hampshire? <i>We want to berelevant too</i>. And so was triggered a pell-mell scramble forward through thecalendar. <p>In 1992, despite Super Tuesday, it took the Republicans until April 27 tonominate 60 percent of their delegates, and until May 5--the old date of theOhio primary--to get past 70 percent. In 1996 nearly 70 percent of allRepublican delegates will have been nominated by April Fool's Day. Before, alosing candidate might keep struggling, hoping to pick up California's hugeblock of delegates in the first week of June. California now votes at the endof March, and after that a trailing candidate is effectively out of the race.<p>The intensification of the schedule does not merely speed up the nominatingprocess; it also spreads it out geographically. A candidate must now campaignin more states at the same time than ever before: Colorado and Connecticut,Georgia and Maine, Maryland and Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island, andVermont, will all vote on March 5, and New York on March 7. Then on to Texasand Oregon, Florida and Mississippi, Tennessee and Oklahoma, a week later.Jimmy Carter enjoyed seven weeks of relative calm in which to fund-raise afterIowa. In 1996 candidates will need to charter jets, gear up nationalorganizations, and buy Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City broadcast timeas early as mid-February. They'd better have their millions banked by thisChristmas--or even earlier. Even in New Hampshire, television commercials havebecome decisive. David Shribman, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington bureauchief of <i>The Boston Globe</i>, has covered New Hampshire primaries fortwenty years. He says it has long since ceased to be true that you can carryNew Hampshire by shaking hands: "You can't win if you're on the village greenbut not on the television screen."<p>Which bumps us up against the other hard fact of American politics: itscampaign-finance laws. These laws, adopted in the wake of the Watergatescandal, set a $1,000 maximum on any individual's gift to a presidentialcandidate and a $5,000 maximum on giving by a political-action committee. Theyalso effectively imposed a cap on what a presidential candidate who acceptsfederal matching funds may spend to win the nomination--in 1996 it will beabout $36 million. In one of politics' most spectacular examples of the Law ofUnintended Consequences, the Democratic authors of the reforms, who hoped tolimit the influence of the wealthy on the presidential race and at the sametime to enhance the relative clout of their trade-union allies (labor unions'PACs at the time were more powerful than they are now), instead enlarged thepower of contributors beyond all previous measure.<p>In unreformed America a candidate like George McGovern could run for officewith the support of a few very rich backers who held eccentric ideas. But withan individual-donor limit of $1,000 and a spending limit of $36 million, it nolonger suffices to locate a few eccentric millionaires. A candidate must spendthe now-all-important year before the primaries winning the support ofthousands of affluent contributors. It's like filling a bathtub with atablespoon. And since not even the most grimly determined candidate can woo somany people one by one, he or she must first win the support of the few hundredmaestros of the Rolodex who have proved their ability and willingness tosponsor the fund-raising galas, cocktail parties, breakfast meetings, andintimate suppers necessary to extract the requisite quota of funds from eachmajor region's check-writing Democrats and Republicans. What campaign-financereform has done is to take a commodity in which America rolls in ridiculousoversupply, money, and create an artificial shortage of it--and thus anartificial inflation of the influence and power of those who can mobilize it.<p><p><br><p><br>The wooing of these money mobilizers has, then, become one of the essentialfirst steps of modern campaigning. The pursuit of Cheney moneyman Mel Sembler,the Florida developer and Bush-appointed ambassador to Australia, was a contestas avidly fought and as important as any early caucus or straw-poll beautycontest. (In the end Sembler threw himself behind Alexander.) In his remarkablebook <i>The United States of Ambition</i>, Alan Ehrenhalt observes that the oldmechanisms for screening candidates have collapsed, and that candidates--oncenominated by parties--now nominate themselves. At the presidential level, atleast, that isn't quite true: the party bosses may have vanished, but in theirplace we have the Rolodex men, and behind them the press.<p>Compare Alexander with another Republican presidential aspirant--CarrollCampbell, of South Carolina. Like Alexander, Campbell was twice electedgovernor of a traditionally Democratic southern state. Like Alexander's,Campbell's tenure was widely regarded as an immense success: he modernizedSouth Carolina's antique government by shearing the powers of the state'slargely unsupervised boards, agencies, and commissions and enhancing the moreaccountable office of the governor. He worked for education reform, kept thestate's books in good order, and cut taxes. He deftly combined politicalconservatism with racial moderation. He even lured a car maker, BMW, to thestate. When George Bush lost in 1992, Campbell, too, began to plan a run forthe presidency. He believed that a win in the early South Carolina primarycould propel a popular governor to national prominence. Campbell had lined upthe support of financial contributors and some of his fellow governors. But asstate after state brought its primary forward, Campbell's hopes faded. <p>"They changed the ball game," he says. "The whole ball game. We figured we'dprobably be good for five or six million dollars. Under the old route I wouldhave run in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina and then gone into LittleTuesday. That was the old route: I had a chance to run, raise money as I went,and have a decent showing along the way. <p>"Now you've no time to raise money as you go. There's no time to do yourmailings and get it back in and keep up the cash flow. You have to run in allthe big states at the same time, which is an impossibility for a candidate whois not extremely well known or extremely well funded.<p>"I had a group of people in New Jersey and some in New York who were raisingmoney. I had some people in Texas, and I had a good group in California. Butthey couldn't raise the huge amounts because of the [per-contributor]limitations. I had people who could have raised enough money or givenindividually if they could have given at a higher level. You're not raisingmoney with a tablespoon; it's more like a teaspoon when it's compared with theamount of money you're going to spend."<p>Today Campbell gloomily occupies the presidency of the insurance industry'slobbying organization. <p>What's the difference between Alexander and Campbell? To a considerable extentit's Ted Welch, a former Republican national-finance chairman and Alexander'sprincipal Rolodex man. Welch had success publishing Bibles, dictionaries, andcookbooks, and then heaped up a larger fortune with lucrative real-estateventures in Nashville. He has known Alexander for nearly a quarter of acentury, and began discussing a run for the presidency with him as early as1982. Welch picked me up one Sunday evening at the Stouffer Hotel inNashville--a hotel he built in a downtown complex he developed--dressed in anexpensive blazer over a sport shirt. As we drove off, he picked up his carphone, telephoned the restaurant he'd chosen, and said with the guiltless gustoof the Sunbelt rich: "This is Ted Welch calling. Your landlord. Can we have aquiet booth at the back?"<p>Over a pizza he explained how his job is done. "I don't call strictly out ofthe blue. I'll have some reason to believe that he is either for or susceptibleto being for Alexander. One of Lamar's main fund-raisers in Florida has neverraised money before. Lamar taught her canoeing at an exclusive camp in Floridawhen Lamar was seventeen and this lady was thirteen. She happened to be afriend of mine to begin with. And she's become a very enthusiasticfund-raiser."<p>This reliance on friendships is typical of the Alexander campaign. Alexander'ssupporters seem not only to be uninterested in his message but to be activelydisregarding it. A moderate as governor and Education Secretary (although heprefers the term "activist conservative"), since the summer of 1993 Alexanderhas been seeking the presidency as an ultra-Jeffersonian radical. "Theprincipal threat to freedom abroad has collapsed," he says, "but the principalthreat at home has grown more menacing. The evil empire in the Kremlin has beendefeated, spreading freedom in its wake. But the government in Washington,D.C., has become an arrogant empire, spreading its tentacles into our everydaylives." To combat the arrogance of Washington, he has proposed radical reformof Congress: "Cut their pay and send them home. Cut in half the time Congressspends in Washington. Cut their pay in half. Take off the rules that prohibittheir taking a real job, and let them work alongside the rest of us." He callsfor a major devolution of responsibility from Washington to the states, endingthe role of the federal government in welfare, crime control, and education. <p>Strong stuff. Yet the Republicans applauding it seem to be drawn almostexclusively from the ideological middle of the Republican Party. Tom Rath,Alexander's genial New Hampshire campaign chairman, voted for Gerald Ford overRonald Reagan in the 1976 New Hampshire primary and for Howard Baker in 1980,and worked for Bob Dole in 1988. Bill Cahill, Alexander's New Hampshirecampaign director, was communications director for President Bush's NewHampshire primary campaign in 1988. David Wilson, one of the wealthiest men inTennessee and an Alexander donor for many years, strongly favored Bush in 1980.<p>To be sure, when asked, Alexander can tick off the names of supporters who hailfrom more-conservative precincts. Indeed, his communications director lastworked for Oliver North. But anyone who has hung around the conservativemovement and the Republican Party need only walk into Alexander's campaignoffice on Nashville's West End Avenue to recognize instantly the atmosphere ofRepublican centrism: the attractive, well-groomed young volunteers, theavoidance of hard-edged issues, the way words like "process" and "consensus"trip off tongues. "Lamar Alexander is a Howard Baker prot&eacute;g&eacute;through and through," says his longtime friend M. Lee Smith, now the owner of acompany that publishes legal newsletters. (Baker, of course, incarnatedmiddle-of-the-road Republicanism.) "Lamar is not a hard-core conservative. Hehas adopted a lot more conservative rhetoric in this campaign, I guess in partbecause the country is moving in that direction and the party especiallyhas."<p>Alexander himself avoids overtly ideological discourse. "I'm not running forsenator, and I'm not running for think-tank president. I'm running for chiefexecutive, and what you want in a chief executive to begin with is characterand temperament and the ability to make executive decisions." Unfortunately forhim, that's not what the secular and religious conservatives who form the onlypotential base of support for a challenge to Bob Dole want. They want someconfidence that a candidate not only can make decisions but will make decisionscongenial to them. And whether or not they feel that confidence depends on anelite that operates alongside the Rolodex men: the press. <p>In the past the press has mattered far more to Democratic candidates than toRepublicans--in part because the Republican nominee was usually marked out soearly, in part because Republicans have mistrusted the reporting of what theysee as the overwhelmingly liberal media. A sympathetic press helped BillClinton to regain his lead after Paul Tsongas won the New Hampshire primary in1992. Joe Klein, who wrote a cover story for <i>New York</i> magazine that issometimes credited with attracting the city's big Democratic donors to Clinton,recalls that "it was just obvious" that Clinton was the best candidate in theDemocratic field--which is, he hastily adds, as much a comment on that field ason Bill Clinton. But Clinton's superiority to Bob Kerrey and Paul Tsongas mightnot have been so obvious to voters who had not invested the time to learn ofthe former's flakiness and the latter's health troubles. The consensus onClinton, Klein recalls, was the product of the reporting of journalists, thebuzzing of party people and consultants, and the preferences of Democraticcheck writers in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles.<p>Now there have emerged explicitly Republican media to do for that party thesame sorting long done for Democrats by the tacitly Democratic networks andmajor metropolitan papers: magazines like <i>The American Spectator</i>,<A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/nationalreview/"><i>National Review</i></A>, and the new <i>Weekly Standard</i>, the editorial page of<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, and--maybe above all--Rush Limbaugh. WhenAlexander backers meet skepticism toward their claim that their candidate isthe most conservative in the race, they fall back on a second argument: that heis "sufficiently" conservative. Should the Alexander campaign show signs ofsucceeding, the credibility of that claim among Republican primary voters willdepend to quite an amazing extent on whether Limbaugh and the conservativepress buy it. <p><p><br><p><br>Is this bad? Is it wrong that relatively small groups of people should havearrogated to themselves the task of promoting potential Presidents, as TedWelch has done, or vetoing them, as the press has the power to do? The rhetoricof American democracy insists that it is wrong. Even Lamar Alexander--whosecandidacy exists only and entirely because of his skill at exciting theenthusiasm of Republican organizers--takes pains to present himself as anopponent of elites. Hence the trademark red-and-black-checked shirt.<p>But let's entertain for a moment a heretical thought. If not for the TedWelches, how could American democracy work? This is an enormous country, andvirtually everybody in it has work to do and children to raise. Once upon atime the machinery of the two great political parties sorted through thepotential candidates. But that machinery rusted away long ago. All that remainsis the candidates themselves, a hundred million voters unwilling to contributevery much more to the political process than their ballot on Election Day, and,interceding between them, some tens of thousands of donors, party activists,political professionals, and journalists. Some utopian political theoristsimagine that if it were not for this last group, American democracy wouldrevert to the intensely participatory politics of the earliest days of theRepublic. Fat chance. In an era of immense wealth and instant communications, apolitics somehow liberated from the political class--if such a thing can beimagined at all--would resemble the Jesse Jackson campaigns of 1984 and 1988and the Ross Perot campaign of 1992: ad hoc mass movements in the service ofcharismatic leaders. <p>As a country imbued with a deep ethic of social equality, America has neverreconciled itself to the existence of elites. Elites that frankly acknowledgetheir own existence and attempt to justify their own position--the Federalistleaders of the 1780s, the new industrial millionaires of the turn of thecentury--have without exception brought retribution crashing down upon theirheads. But the country's anti-elitism has never succeeded in replacing eliteswith direct popular government, both for the reason identified by James Madisonand Alexander Hamilton, two centuries ago--the country is too big--and for thereason frankly spelled out by Joseph Schumpeter in the 1940s: the job is toodifficult.<p>Instead, American anti-elitism has again and again replaced explicit eliteswith disguised ones. Ambitious state-chartered bankers and hungry landspeculators in New York exploited anti-elitist feeling to topple the toorestrictive Bank of the United States in the 1830s; the Harvard-educated NewDealers appealed to the same emotion to expand the power of people likethemselves over the American economy. The populist electoral reforms of the1960s and 1970s replicated the inevitable pattern. The party to make and unmakepresidential candidates has migrated from ward bosses in derby hats and checkedsuits to local business leaders who can fill a hotel ballroom with friends withcheckbooks.<p>Some may be tempted to adventure yet another round of political reform: fullpublic funding of campaigns or free television advertising. But somebody willstill have to decide whether Robert Dornan and Lenora Fulani get money and freetelevision, and how much, and how much Bob Dole and Bill Clinton get. Theproblem of unequal impact on the political system--if it is a problem atall--is simply an ineradicable one.<p>Maybe there's another way to think about this. Maybe we should be worrying lessabout the existence of elites and more about their quality, less about theirexcess of money and more about their deficiencies of public spirit. Maybe weshould worry that American society's primordial hostility to elites, itsdetermination to force those elites to disguise themselves and deny theirinevitable influence, nourishes their irresponsibility and stunts their senseof public obligation. Maybe we should accept as inevitable that those who carethe most about politics can most effectively sway the political system, andshould worry instead that this political elite itself is so easily swayed bycharm and a home-state accent. </blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

<blockquote>

	



	<font size=5>M</font>Y husband works for a giant corporation we call the Widowmaker. After a fast

start he's had ten years without a promotion. He's at his wits' end. So

I recommended that he try to distinguish himself there on Casual Wear Day, which

is every Friday, when they're allowed to wear their chinos and golf 

shirts.<p>



"Go barefoot," I recommended. "If your bosses come along, start yelling and

yodeling--'Turkey in the Straw.' That's the way to get noticed. Do that extra

bit that the other fellow won't." He didn't even bother to say no.<p>



He likes his job and even has a nerdy briefcase. He gets high ratings, so why

is this happening? Naturally, he doesn't want to go completely bald while still

at district level! I think there must be a way to help him.<p>



One evening in bed he was going over a report that he had to present the next

day. It said on the cover "AGENDA:Telco/Cable Cross-ownership." I laughed and

said, "Right below that you should put 'HIDDEN AGENDA: My Advancement in This

Company.' They might feel sorry for you. Like, 'Bob's quite humorous. Let's

surprise him with a promotion!'"<p>



</blockquote>



			<img src="./Lew.gif" hspace=10 vspace=10 alt=""><p>

<blockquote>



But he could not get into it. I know that his strategy will remain plain old

working hard year in and year out. Yet every so often he laughs horribly and

says, "You'll see, one of these days I'm going to make my move. I'm going to

storm the ranks of middle middle management!" He's really in a lot of pain.<p>



Even if he got promoted, we'd still be in debt. Especially since he'd probably

go straight out and install French drains in the basement or something, and

they are not interesting, however they may sound. And then, too, I don't have

any important jewelry yet, so I might go ahead and get something, sure--but then

I'd only be wearing it Friday nights, the nights we pop popcorn and rent

videos.<p>



However, I apparently do have the drive to succeed--even if meaninglessly--because I have come up with another idea, if only Bob will go for

it. It's like this: The atmosphere over at the Widowmaker is a very wholesome

one. "We're all deacons in the Methodist Church," they seem to be saying. Or "We

all just about <i>could</i> be deacons in the Methodist Church." Now, my poor

hubby is vying with about a million of these deacons. All of them--except that

Long Island guy we sold our car to--seem this way. All of them are Republican,

too, by the way--purely to do with their income taxes. If you ever ask them one

thing about any other aspect of politics, they'll laugh and say, "Hey,

remember, I'm just a tech weenie. I was <i>hired</i> as a tech weenie!" My

husband was also hired as a tech weenie, but he doesn't care about it one way

or the other.<p>



They talk about their cars and their car maintenance all day, even though they

now also have two young children to talk about. They are always saying they

went to put oil in their wife's car and it took four quarts! It's happened to

all the men at the Widowmaker at least once. Peering into that oil thing was

just like gazing into a bottomless well of anxiety. And besides, if they have

to go stand in a long line at the cafeteria, they'll say something like "Wish

me luck; I'll need it!"<p>



<font size=5>S</font>O that's the atmosphere over there, put on or genuine, as I perceive it from

Widowmaker picnics, etc. Well, my husband could never beat them at that

wholesomeness game, even if he does have a nerdy briefcase (which he shopped

high and low for, so that he could use it like a desk on planes!). My idea,

therefore, is for him to distinguish himself with an entirely different image

around the office. I would like him to present himself as a sort of dark

racketeer.<p>



If he would just buy himself a shiny silver-gray suit and a pale-blue Countess

Mara tie, and if he would change his name--and I mean change it to Lew Manette.

Then he should become a loner. Then, next time he's presenting a report on

Telco/Cable Cross-ownership, he should be seen to have kind of a bulge under

his arm. And in the cafeteria, while they're swarming all over their chili

dogs, he should tell them he's "nursing a single whiskey."<p>



When they send him on trips to Washington, Boston, or San Francisco, he will

cash in his plane ticket and drive without stopping in an old black Mercury

Montego. Before he leaves, he will remind the travel agent not to bother about

reserving a room--just to hand him some cash. This will get innuendo going.<p>



Once a month or so I'll go into the office and hang around all day in red capri

pants and a sharkskin halter. He won't acknowledge me or introduce me to

anyone, and I'll keep my legs up on his desk, doing my nails. I'll look up

indifferently when the United Way coordinator comes in.<p>



When a vice-president says to him, "Bob, I mean 'Lew,' I'll be needing you to

put together a twenty-minute speech for my meeting in San Francisco--you know,

competition among the local exchange carriers--" my husband will lean way back

in his chair and say, "Well, well . . ." in a sarcastic voice.<p>



Of course, I don't know what the other man's reaction will be, but surely this

approach has never been tried! Moreover, Lew's only concession to Casual Wear

Day will be to remove his jacket and go around with the gun showing.<p>



He will have no special relationship with his own secretary, but will get

little chores out of whichever woman happens to cross his path as he moves

among the cubicles like a lithe jungle cat. Sometimes, purely by accident,

he'll ask something of his own secretary. <p>



"Oh, Mr. Manette," she'll say, "I've been waiting and waiting for you to let me

do something!" <p>



He'll shrug and say, "It's Lew, babe, just Lew."<p>



As always, jittery groups will form and re-form just outside his line of

vision. One day someone will say, "He says his new name is Lew Manette."<p>



"I'm not sure whether he deserves to be promoted," another will add in a

tentative voice.<p>



"He used to be okay! He was hired as a tech weenie!"<p>



And then someone will murmur, "You'd better promote him, Willard. He could get

riled up."

<p>

<blockquote>





	<font size=5>S</font>PEED in music can be a form of abstraction. About fifteen or twenty years ago

the vibraphonist Milt Jackson, of the Modern Jazz Quartet, played an engagement

at a Philadelphia neighborhood lounge, accompanied by a trio of uninspired

local musicians. Visibly unhappy, Jackson sleepwalked through the first few

numbers, nearly sinking to the level of the house trio instead of trying to

raise it to his own. To make matters worse, a patron at the bar, who was either

drunk or eager to show the rest of us how <i>down</i> with bebop he was, acted

as if Jackson were taking requests. <p>





<A HREF="./budbg.gif"><img src="./budsm.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="" border=0></A>



The man wanted to hear a certain Charlie Parker tune. &quot;How 'bout some 'Scrapple

From the Apple,' brother?&quot; he whined before every number, disrupting the band's

concentration as Jackson counted off tempos. <p>



After enduring this several times, Jackson fixed the man with a contemptuous

stare. Without a word of warning to his sidemen, he tossed off the opening bars

of &quot;Scrapple From the Apple&quot; at a tempo about twice as fast as Parker's

moderate gallop. Racing to keep up with him after joining him on the bridge,

the local musicians were soon playing way over their heads. The tempo kept

accelerating, with Jackson's hands and mallets disappearing into twin blurs.

Small talk at the tables came to a stop, and there was an extra split second of

silence at the end, before we could bring our hands together to applaud. It

lasted just long enough for Jackson's final note to echo gracefully, and for a

familiar voice to plead, &quot;'Scrapple From the Apple,' huh, Milt? Do it for

<i>me</i>?&quot;<p>



<font size=5>I</font> DOUBT the barfly would have recognized &quot;Tea for 

Two&quot; at the diabolical tempo the pianist <A 

HREF="http://www.nwu.edu/WNUR/jazz/artists/powell.bud/index.html">Bud 

Powell</A> chose for the ten consecutive versions he recorded, one right 

after another, at a 1950 recording session with the bassist Ray Brown and 

the drummer Buddy Rich.  Some of these may have been false starts or 

incomplete takes; only the fifth, sixth, and tenth have ever been released.  

These three turned up again last year on <i>The Complete Bud Powell on 

Verve</i> (<A HREF="http://www.jazzonln.com/JAZZ/LABELS/VERVE2/583.htm">Verve</A> 314 521 669-2), a five-disc set of Powell's recordings 

from 1949 to 1956 for Norman Granz's various labels (Mercury, Norgran, and 

Clef, as well as Verve).  <p>



Take ten is the killer.  [Download an excerpt from <A 

HREF="./tea4two.aif">take ten</A> of "Tea for Two" (AIFF, 680 K).] Powell 

begins slowly, as he does on the earlier takes, with an arioso statement of 

the seldom-performed verse, all the while half humming and half grunting an 

eerie countersong (a tic he shared with Glenn Gould); the ghost 

&quot;voice&quot; here could actually be Brown bowing his string bass.  

After you've heard Powell play &quot;Tea for Two&quot; and know what's 

coming next, your pulse begins to race in anticipation.  A pianist I know 

says this performance is in &quot;one,&quot; by which he means that no 

bandleader could count off four beats that fast without getting 

tongue-tied.  Powell's improvised choruses hurry along at 336 quarter notes 

a minute, though a metronome would be useless in clocking his accelerating 

parade of sixteenths.  This is not a tempo you could tap your foot to--who 

can tap his foot that fast?<p>



Recognized by fellow musicians as the seminal <A 

HREF="http://www.nwu.edu/WNUR/jazz/ms-primer/ms-primer-2-3.html">bebop</A> 

pianist almost from the moment in 1943 when, as a teenager, he made his 

professional debut as a sideman with the trumpeter Cootie Williams's big 

band, Powell is usually spoken of today not as an innovator but as a 

carrier of innovation.  That is, he's credited with &quot;translating&quot; 

<A HREF="http://www.wam.umd.edu/~losinp/music/bird.html">Charlie 

Parker's</A> harmonic ideas to piano, much as J.  J.  Johnson is credited 

with translating them to trombone and Milt Jackson to vibraphone.  This is 

meant figuratively--a way of saying that Parker showed the way and others 

soon followed.  But the guitarist Bill De Arango tells an anecdote that 

puts a literal spin on the idea.  Powell could be obnoxious as a young man, 

and De Arango once heard him bedevil Parker at a jam session by echoing 

each of Parker's phrases on piano a split second after Parker delivered it 

on his horn.  <p>



Some performances of Powell's sound like direct replies to Parker.  A good 

example is &quot;Bud's Bubble,&quot; from Powell's daredevil first session 

as a leader, in 1947.  It's included on <i>Bud Powell: The Complete Blue 

Note and Roost Recordings</i> (<A 

HREF="http://www.jazzonln.com/JAZZ/LABELS/BN/bn30083.htm">Blue Note</A> CDP 

7243 8 30083 2 2), a four-disc set that arrived in stores almost 

simultaneously with <i>The Complete Bud Powell on Verve</i> and overlaps 

with it chronologically; the set begins in 1947 and ends with a track 

recorded in Paris in 1963, three years before Powell's death from 

tuberculosis, malnutrition, and the effects of alcoholism.  Nearly all the 

important recordings Powell made as a leader in the late 1940s and very 

early 1950s are on one or the other of these two sets, together with hours 

of performances from 1953 onward that trace his irreversible decline.  <p>



&quot;Bud's Bubble&quot; finds Powell at the top of his game. [Download an 

excerpt from <A HREF="./bubble.aif">"Bud's Bubble"</A> (AIFF, 621 K).] The tune itself--the

&quot;line,&quot; as musicians say--is essentially a speeded-up, more percussive version

of Parker and Little Benny Harris's &quot;Crazeology,&quot; which was itself based on the

chord changes in George and Ira Gershwin's &quot;I Got Rhythm.&quot; The specific Parker

performance that Powell is chasing is probably the warp-speed &quot;Ko Ko&quot; that

Parker had recorded just two years earlier, with Curly Russell on bass and Max

Roach on drums--the same rhythm team as on &quot;Bud's Bubble.&quot; The tempo here might

actually be a hair faster than on the tenth take of &quot;Tea for Two,&quot; and given

that hornlike lines delivered with such velocity on piano require that each

note be struck with even pressure and achieve equal duration, Powell's

effortless articulation becomes even more impressive than his speed. But the

most impressive aspect of all might be his ability to phrase coherently at such

a daunting tempo--to think that fast and to translate his thoughts into action.

<p>



Powell was no match for Parker on ballads or blues. All too typical of his

ballad interpretations, the Blue Note set's &quot;I Should Care,&quot; from 1947, and the

Verve set's &quot;You Go to My Head,&quot; from 1955, are somber and without lilt, full

of puddled arpeggios and sub-Lisztian block chords worthier of the average

cocktail pianist than of one of the finest improvisers in the history of jazz.

(In contrast, Powell's 1949 &quot;Celia&quot; and his 1951 &quot;The Fruit,&quot; both of which are

on the Verve set, can be counted among the most winning of original bebop

ballads, once you accept the premise that ballads don't have to be slow.) 

[Download an excerpt from <A HREF="./celia.aif">"Celia"</A> (AIFF, 833 K).]

Powell's blues, though crisp and delivered with &eacute;lan, lacked the

earthiness and melodic lilt of Parker's. But on up-tempo tunes of the sort at

which both men excelled, Powell enjoyed one advantage over Parker: he didn't

have to pause occasionally for breath. If only in that regard, his style wasn't

hornlike at all. <p>



Besides, to emphasize Powell's conceptual debt to Parker risks overlooking

Powell's considerable influence on several generations of pianists, beginning

with George Wallington, Walter Bishop Jr., and others of Powell's

contemporaries whose solos often anthologized his. Hank Jones and Tommy

Flanagan softened Powell's attack with generous amounts of Teddy Wilson and Nat

King Cole. Bill Evans's inner voicings originated in Powell's 1951 Verve

recording of &quot;Oblivion,&quot; and the beginnings of both McCoy Tyner and Cecil

Taylor are discernible in the skeletal harmonic structure and implied double

meter of Powell's 1951 Blue Note recording of &quot;Un Poco Loco.&quot; <p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE question of how much Powell owed Parker also 

ignores his arguably greater debt to two fellow pianists, Art Tatum and <A 

HREF="http://www.nwu.edu/jazz/artists/monk.thelonious/">Thelonious 

Monk.</A>  Powell's senior by fifteen years, and the reigning virtuoso 

among jazz pianists when Powell burst onto the scene in the late 1940s, 

Tatum once dismissed him as &quot;just a right-handed piano player,&quot; 

supplying a corollary of sorts to the notion that what Powell played with 

his right hand was merely transposed Charlie Parker.  Powell ultimately 

gained Tatum's approval by sitting down at Birdland, the famous New York 

nightclub, one night when Tatum was there and playing a song at lightning 

speed with his left hand alone.  <p>



Or so the story goes. But it misses the point--or Tatum did, if the story is

true. Powell in effect reconfigured the keyboard to the specifications of

bebop, not just spinning out fleet successions of single notes with his right

hand but also sounding broken chords and off-the-beat accents with his left.

His left hand catapulted his right. The best way to explain its often

misunderstood function in Powell's music might be to say that he <i>drummed

</i>with it, instead of playing stride bass with it in the manner of Tatum and

most other earlier jazz pianists.<p>



Powell's left hand was so effective that even as resourceful a drummer as the

young Max Roach seems to be there mainly to supply texture on &quot;Bud's Bubble&quot;

and his numerous other early recordings with Powell. You certainly don't miss

drums or bass on the eight performances from Powell's 1951 solo session for

Verve. (These include his first recording of his Gershwin-like &quot;Parisian

Thoroughfare,&quot; the one Powell tune to enter the standard repertoire, thanks

largely to a later recording by Roach and the trumpeter Clifford Brown, with

Powell's younger brother, Richie, on piano.) [Download an excerpt from 

<A HREF="./paris.aif">"Parisian Thoroughfare"</A> (AIFF, 748 K).] <p>



In keeping tempo with bass and drums on &quot;Tea for Two,&quot; Powell's left hand does

underline just how impossibly fast his right hand is moving. The specter of

Tatum hovers over all three of Powell's surviving takes of the song, which

Vincent Youmans composed for the 1925 Broadway musical <i>No, No, Nanette</i>.

The song was already known as a Tatum tour de force, a showcase for his

harmonic imagination and nimble fingers. (Hearing Tatum play the song in a

nightclub, Timme Rosenkranz, a jazz writer and hanger-on, once exclaimed, &quot;It

sounded like 'Tea for Two Thousand.'&quot;) That Powell bothered to record ten takes

of a tune deemed good enough for release on the fifth could be interpreted as

an attempt to beat Tatum at his own game, just as Powell frequently attempted

to beat Parker at his.<p>



Playing the verse, or introduction, in an exaggeratedly slow tempo was Powell's

idea (Tatum also began out of tempo, but with several bars from the end of the

song, the part that goes &quot;We will raise a family&quot;); he may have had it while

listening to Monk or playing informally with him. Monk, a connoisseur of the

American popular song, also led with the verse when he finally got around to

recording &quot;Tea for Two,&quot; in 1956. (Whereas Powell seemed intent on

demonstrating that he could play the song faster than anybody else, Monk seemed

determined to prove that he could play it slower.) Verse aside, what most

distinguishes Powell's &quot;Tea for Two&quot; from Tatum's is his abrupt bebop cadences

and the modernist gambit of reharmonizing the melody into ascending

chromatics--as much a form of disguise as the whirlwind tempo. Whitney

Balliett, the jazz critic for <i>The New Yorker</i>, in one of his periodic

forays into literary criticism, once characterized the novelist Alice McDermott

as &quot;Henry James without the furbelows and bibelots and antimacassars.&quot; This was

Powell's relationship to Tatum: he retained few of Tatum's neo-Victorian

frills.<p>



Another modern element in Powell's &quot;Tea for Two&quot; is the suggestion of

dissonance in his jabbing right hand--not as pronounced as on some of his

recordings of his own material but there all the same. This, too, would seem to

reflect the influence of Monk, of whom Powell was simultaneously champion and

disciple. At a time when Monk was still being dismissed as an oddball whose

work was irrelevant, Powell's liberal use of dissonance provided a blueprint

for jazz after Parker. <p>



Powell's influence (and Monk's) on instrumentalists other than pianists began

to assert itself only after Parker's death, in 1955. By that time Powell

himself was no longer the pianist he had been, and no longer quite the person.

<p>



<font size=5>B</font>EBOP'S wanton speed and abstraction--its affronts to melody and its cubist

approach to harmony and rhythm--still account for a large part of its appeal.

But at least as much of its lingering mystique depends on our perception of

many of its originators as self-destructive black outlaws whose philosophy

might as well have been that dying young was the best revenge against the

philistines and racists who would deny them both as artists and as men. <p>



It is frequently suggested in the literature on Bud Powell that he acted crazy

because Monk or Parker or the pianist Elmo Hope or somebody in a position to

know convinced him that it was the only sane way of dealing with an insane

world (early bop seemed precariously balanced on the thin line between madness

and black rage). But Powell was mad by any standard, from the outset of his

career. <p>



&quot;Bud was always . . . a little on the border line,&quot; the tenor saxophonist

Dexter Gordon once told the critic Ira Gitler. &quot;Because he'd go off into

things--expressions, telltale things that would let you know he was off.&quot;

Powell was first institutionalized in 1945, following an arrest for being drunk

and disorderly in a Philadelphia train station while on the road with Cootie

Williams. He is believed to have been beaten repeatedly about the head by the

arresting officers, and consequently to have suffered lifelong neurological

problems. <p>



He suffered his first nervous breakdown in November of 1947, eleven months

after recording &quot;Bud's Bubble,&quot; and was committed to a Long Island sanatorium

for almost a year. There he was first given shock treatments--possibly

electroconvulsive therapy, which induces seizure. Powell's 1951 arrest for

possession of a small amount of marijuana resulted in another extended period

of confinement and (some musicians believed)enough ECT to short-circuit him for

good. <p>



Powell has been undervalued as a composer, a point driven home in listening 

to the Verve and Blue Note sets in tandem.  His most ambitious piece was 

&quot;Glass Enclosure,&quot; which he recorded for Blue Note in 1953, with 

George Duvivier on bass and Art Taylor on drums.  [Download an excerpt from 

<A HREF="./glass.aif">"Glass Enclosure"</A> (AIFF, 604 K).] There's a story 

attached to the title.  Powell had been released from a mental institution 

only six months before.  Oscar Goodstein, the manager of Birdland, had been 

appointed Powell's legal guardian, and he kept Powell under what amounted 

to house arrest in an East Side high-rise.  &quot;They wanted to be sure 

he'd appear [at the club], so they took complete control of his life,&quot; 

Alfred Lion, of Blue Note Records, recalled years later.  &quot;One day 

Oscar gave me the key and I went up.  There was a piano there and [Powell] 

played me some new things.  One piece really stood out.  I asked him what 

he called it.  He looked around the apartment and said, 'Glass 

Enclosure.'&quot;<p>



Worlds away in mood from the effervescent &quot;Bud's Bubble,&quot; despite the grim

similarity of the two titles, &quot;Glass Enclosure&quot; juxtaposes to harrowing effect

an agitated blues riff and a ten-bar fanfare fit for a king. It includes no

improvisation; Duvivier probably deserves credit for the arrangement as well as

the steel-ribbed bass lines. This piece has to be played Powell's way or not at

all, which explains why it's so rarely performed. But Powell also composed any

number of conventional bop lines that might serve as excellent jam-session

vehicles--for example, the breezy &quot;Celia&quot; or, better still, &quot;Dance of the

Infidels,&quot; with its flatted and slightly demented bugle-call introduction, from

Powell's 1949 Blue Note date with Fats Navarro on trumpet and a very young

Sonny Rollins on tenor saxophone. Powell's introductions and bridges were often

wonderful little songs in themselves; this quality may have been another

beneficial effect of his friendship with Monk. <p>



It's possible that the reason so few musicians play Powell's compositions along

with the usual ones by Monk and Parker and Dizzy Gillespie is that Powell's

tunes are perceived as inextricable from his virtuosity as a pianist. But there

might be another reason. A first step for a composer who wants to make a number

a jazz standard is to perform it in concert night after night. Powell didn't do

this, at least to judge from recorded air checks of his 1950s New York

performances, which typically feature him playing pop standards and such

familiar bebop anthems as Gillespie's &quot;Salt Peanuts&quot; and &quot;A Night in Tunisia.&quot;

Powell either couldn't remember his own tunes by that point or was in no shape

to teach them to his sidemen. <p>



<font size=5>A</font> FEW months after recording his final Blue Note album as a leader, in the

closing days of 1958, Powell emigrated to Paris for five years, where he was

eventually cared for by the graphic artist Francis Paudras. (The friendship

between Powell and Paudras was the inspiration for the 1986 movie <i>'Round

Midnight</i>, though the character played by Dexter Gordon had more in common

with Lester Young). Paudras nursed Powell back to partial health, with the

emphasis on &quot;partial.&quot; <p>



&quot;He was overweight, sullen, and unapproachable, given to staring

silently at the wall, twiddling his fingers when not playing,&quot; Alan Groves

writes of seeing Powell in Paris in 1961, in the preface to <i>The Glass

Enclosure</i>, a slim but informative volume on Powell's life and career

written with Alyn Shipton and published in England in 1993. &quot;He sat virtually

motionless, and it was only his hands that moved when he did play. He appeared

to have no interest in his surroundings, and little interest in his music.&quot; <p>



Powell displayed symptoms that may have been related to schizophrenia or head

trauma. He was said to alarm people by grinning or grimacing for no apparent

reason, to look out at audiences with a blank stare, and to hold his breath

almost to the point of asphyxiation during some of his solos. According to

Groves and Shipton, Paudras once &quot;listened in on a long and sympathetic

interview with Bud [by a French doctor], at which Powell admitted to dreaming

at night that he was constantly playing the piano, and that, even when awake,

he was prone to the same dreams.&quot; <i>The Complete Blue Note and Roost

Recordings</i> ends, in 1963, with a version of &quot;Like Someone in Love&quot; that was

recorded during a lull in a Dexter Gordon session. [Download an excerpt 

from <A HREF="./inlove.aif">"Like Someone in Love"</A> (AIFF, 680 K).] Powell might as well be

playing that dream piano--he certainly doesn't sound obsessed with the one in

front of him. The track is as much an afterthought as Powell's death in New

York, three years later. It's difficult to believe that this pianist is the

same man who at his first recording session, only sixteen years earlier,

confidently tossed off eight numbers in the time allotted for four, with no

need for retakes. <p>



Powell never lost his velocity--only his intensity, his sense of continuity,

his rhythmic spring. The most alarming evidence on his American recordings of

his decline after 1953 was the decreased activity of his left hand. He

continued to drum with it, but almost absentmindedly--not to such furious

purpose as before. The later material on <i>The Complete Bud Powell on

Verve</i> and <i>The Complete Blue Note and Roost Recordings</i> isn't

appalling, just uneven. He would recapture his form and then lose it again,

often within one recording session or one number. Performances like &quot;Blue

Pearl&quot; and the two takes of &quot;Comin' Up,&quot; from his very last Blue Note session

as a leader, suffer only by comparison with his earlier works. To ask which

pianist's later work does not similarly suffer misses the point. Less than a

decade separates early Powell from late. A foreknowledge of this shadows even

his early masterpieces in tragedy. <p>

<blockquote>
	
<b>How did you come to write a piece on Bud Powell?</b><p>

<p>

The occasion seemed right for it given the release of two boxed sets, his 
complete Verve recordings and complete Blue Note recordings.  I also hadn't 
done a jazz piece for <i>The Atlantic</i> for a while.  The last jazz piece 
was on Roswell Rudd, a trombone player.  Since then I've done five or six 
pieces but they were all on various other things, everything ranging from 
Elvis Presley to Stephen Sondheim, rap, <I>Guys and Dolls</I>, and the 
TV-show <I>Seinfeld</I>.  But no jazz piece for a while, so it seemed like 
a good time to write one.<p>

<p>


<b>How does bebop fit into the history of jazz?</b><p>

<p>

It has become jazz in a sense. It's what most people think of when they think
of jazz at this point. It's what's usually meant. It's been the mainstream of
jazz for over forty years now and approaching a half-century, which is an
interesting development because it started off as a kind of avant-garde
movement, though I don't think any of the musicians themselves would have
described it that way. It's become synonymous with jazz in the same way that a
handful of composers like Beethoven and so on have become synonymous with
classical music. <p>

<p>

<b>Is there a point in history where bebop overtook traditional jazz?</b><p>

<p>

The most convenient place you could point to would be the 1941 recording by
Jay McShann's big band that has Charles Parker in the saxophone section. And he
did a solo. I don't think anyone at the time realized that this represented a
real break. Looking back, we can see that it did. We can see that as a real
transition point.<p>

<p>

<b>Do you think bebop makes a political statement?</b><p>

<p>

It's always tough to distinguish politics from culture in the first place. I
think a lot of it had to do with drugs and with the introduction of heroin.
Like that famous scene in <i>The Godfather</i>, whether it's true or not, when
they decide to concentrate on black areas in distributing the stuff. It sounds
like a sweeping statement to say that most of the important players had a
period in which they were hooked on drugs, but I think it might even be true. A
large number had gone through that and some of them didn't survive. It seems
part of the romance of the music--part of the romance both then and now. The
rebellious junkie-genius. Bud Powell was not a heroin user as far as anyone can
tell. But he certainly came close to drinking himself to death to get rid of
all the other problems that he had. I think because madness was so much a part
of that world that it's hard to separate Bud Powell's individual madness from
the madness of the music and the madness of the period. But here's somebody who
really was mad by any standards.<p>

<p>

<b>What drove him to his madness? Had he always had it?</b><p>

<p>

I think it's a combination of both.  A lot is blamed on three things.  
First there's the problem of race.  That compounded by the problems that 
artists face regardless of race, especially in pursuing something that is 
seen as a challenge to the status quo and is initially unpopular.  Third 
there was the clubbing over the head he suffered by the police and the 
shock treatment that he received during the various times he was 
insitutionalized.  There are earlier indications that he had antisocial 
tendencies.  He could be very erratic.  There's a story that's not in my 
piece about the first time that [Thelonius] Monk brought Powell to the 
after-hours sessions, when Powell was a very young man.  He gets kicked out 
because he puts his feet up on the new white table cloths.  The club 
management kicked him out.  There are plenty of stories like that from when 
Bud Powell was a teenager.  I think he was already drinking pretty heavily.  
<p>

<p>

<b>Was he just a defiant person?</b><p>

<p>

Yes, but his defiance expressed itself not only in his relationships with
record company owners or club owners, but with other musicians. One anecdote
that got left out of the piece for reasons of length: At that first recording
session the trio wound up recording eight numbers. They were only supposed to
record four, but the four went so smoothly without any hitch so they had extra
studio time. So the producer asked them if they'd record four more. For some
reason--and this is before LPs--they recorded what amounted to two 78 records
in each session--"a" side and "b" side. Powell said yes. The drummer Max Roach
said quite reasonably that they should be paid double for it. And Bud Powell
said to Max Roach, his own drummer: "What are you complaining for? You're just
keeping time. I'm doing all the work." If you listen to Max Roach's drumming,
he's not just keeping time. They almost came to blows and the producer had to
separate them. Then they recorded the other four numbers without a hitch.
Powell's arrogance and defiance expressed itself with other musicians too. At
least when he was a young man. When he got older he seemed lost, tragic--his
fighting days were over.<p>

<p>

<b>Do you see a relationship between the jazz music of that era and
African-American music of today--say rap or funk?</b><p>


<p>

I think people are always willing to make a connection between bebop and
hip-hop just because they rhyme. But I think there's a real connection between
the blues and hip-hop. The interesting thing about hip-hop is that it is a kind
of folk music, though it is dependent on technology. It is a kind of homemade
folk music with people using whatever means are available to them to make
music. I think one thing that separates 1940s bop players from musicians today
is that we shouldn't underestimate the ability and dedication it takes to learn
how to play an instrument. It is a skill that most people involved in hip-hop
have not mastered.<p>

<p>

<B>What do you think about the movie <i>'Round Midnight </i> ? You mentioned it in
your article as creating an appreciation for jazz.</B><p>

<p>

I wasn't much impressed with it at the time, but in memory it holds up a lot
better. It's certainly a better movie than <i>Bird</i>. It's got a nice rainy,
tea-stained atmosphere to it that gets at something. It's more a movie, despite
Dexter Gordon's performance, about fan-dom and fan-dom as a kind of fetish.
What's unfortunate about <i>'Round Midnight</i> from the standpoint of Bud
Powell is that Powell kind of gets confused with Lester Young and Dexter Gordon
himself and he becomes a kind of Everyman or Everycat. Bud Powell kind of gets
lost. It's hard to separate Bud Powell from the madness of the music or the
madness of the period. It becomes like a symptom of the times, rather than
something specific to him. And the same happens with his music, his fantastic
playing, not just from a technical standpoint--it's hard to play that fast
regardless of the music you're playing--but also rhythmically and harmonically.
It pointed to futher developments in jazz. Bud Powell has been seen as a kind
of adjunct to Charlie Parker, as the guy who translated Charlie Parker's stuff
to piano. If that's all he had done, that would certainly be quite an
accomplishment. But I think you could argue that if there was anyone equal to
Parker it was Powell.<p>

		ANNAH has an imaginary playmate. His name is Ryan Ray. I am first made

aware of him one Sunday afternoon as I prepare to mow the lawn. I gird up my

loins for it--snap into place my allergy mask, pull my ball cap down low and

tight on my head, hoist and hitch up my gym shorts and argyle socks. As I do

this--brace myself--Hannah bursts out the back door and shouts at the swing

set, "Ryan Ray! You get off that right now!" and then stands with her fists on

her hips, her jaw pushed forward, glaring at a swing that as near as I can tell

is empty, dangling and swaying loosely in the light wind.<p>



<img src="Swings.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>





I feel something cold arc through my chest, and believe for an instant that my

daughter has lost her mind. "Hannah!" I shout--a familiar voice, a line with

which to pull her back to this world. "Hannah! What are you doing?" <p>



She turns to face me and raises her hands, pink palms forward, signaling that

all is well. "It's okay, Daddy," she says. "He's off." And then she smiles

sweetly, takes two rabbit hops forward and one back, and runs into the house

again.<p>



I start the mower and lurch across the lawn, my face tucked in to avoid the

dust, my upper body vibrating as if I had hold of a jackhammer, and I see

Hannah as she was, standing on the patio and shouting at air. Surely Greta's

family is to blame for this--that collection of crackpots and loons, their

strangely coded DNA seeping into the gene pool, manifesting itself in the fifth

year of our daughter, prompting her to see rascals on empty swings.<p>



We once went to a dinner party given by an acquaintance at the small Missouri

college where I teach literature. The invitation came from a gaunt, hook-nosed

man in the biology department, whose office was across from mine and whom I

could hear breathing noisily throughout the day as he labored over his lecture

notes. "Shoe!" he had shouted one Friday afternoon, from out of the blue, from

across the hall, not bothering even to rise from his desk or show his face.

"You and the missus come to our house tomorrow at seven." And so we did; and

there we met a woman who was terrified of creating strange children.<p>



She sat at one end of the table, next to her fidgeting husband, and confessed

to us, complete strangers, and to three other couples of varying familiarity,

that she feared pregnancy. "Really," she said, leaning forward, enlarging her

eyes as if startled at the revelation, "how do you know that the kid isn't

going to grow up to be an ax murderer or something? I mean, what guarantees are

there?"<p>



After chuckling in what Greta later told me was an unbelievably condescending

manner, I began to explain the predicament of Raskolnikov, but abandoned the

allusion after noticing the dull faces of my dinner companions and the hot

glare of my wife. "I don't know," I said finally. "I suppose there aren't any

guarantees. It's not as if they're returnable."<p>



The woman smacked her lips tartly and shook her head. "You don't understand,"

she said. "How can you be sure that some crazy trait from somewhere in your

family won't be passed along to your child?" <p>



The table, of course, fell silent, everyone surely trying to imagine what sort

of lunatics lurked in this couple's past. The husband reddened and lifted his

eyes from his plate only once, briefly--an anxious, moist glance at the rest of

us, an act of such self-consciousness that I blushed and looked away.<p>



I wrestle the lawn mower around the posts of the swing set, trying to circle

tightly and cut my weed-whip time. Clumps of grass trail from the mower's

filled bag, beneath the dangling swings, upon one of which may be a phantom boy

scooping his gossamer legs to his chest, cursing me and my commotion, waiting

to lead my daughter to other worlds.<p>



I release the throttle and the mower bucks to a stop. My eyes are beginning to

itch, and I feel a thin scratching at the back of my throat. The wind picks up,

pressing its bullying heat upon me as I tilt the bag into a recyclable sack,

swirling the cut grass and dust until I have to step away, lift my mask, and

sneeze violently. I turn to see Hannah, her face bobbing like a pale balloon

behind the porch glass, laughing uproariously. A lover of physical comedy, she

has given up Barney for Chaplin and the Three Stooges; she delights in gouged

eyes and pratfalls.<p>



This past autumn she went trick-or-treating dressed as the Little Tramp, in a

baggy black suit, an undersized bowler, and a twitchy moustache. She waddled,

feet splayed, cane twirling, along the sidewalks in our neighborhood, thwarting

monsters with comic violence. At one treacherous corner, from behind a dark elm

a boy in a hockey mask leaped, waving a rubber ax and contorting his body

grotesquely, threateningly. Before I could step between them to protect her,

Hannah cracked him across the head with her cane, whereupon he dropped his ax

and ran jaggedly for home.<p>



"Why do you let her watch that stuff?" Greta asked later, as we sat in the

living room reading the newspaper. Hannah was in bed, still trembling, no

doubt, from bite-size Baby Ruths and Gummy Bears--the sugary spoils of

conflict.<p>



"What do you mean?" I said. "Chaplin was a genius. She's just cultivating a

taste for classic physical comedy."<p>



"It seems to me that she's cultivating a taste for violence."<p>



"Are you kidding me?" I leaned forward and rustled and snapped the sports

section in a display of pique. "Would you rather she had shrieked and fainted?

You're the last person I dreamed would buy into that horror-film clich&eacute;,

that brand of misogyny."<p>



Greta rolled her eyes. "This wasn't a B-movie scene, Joe. This was real life,

and she actually struck a kid over the head. And I tell you what: I'm going to

be angry if either you or she laughed about it."<p>



<img src="Patio.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>



"Of course we didn't," I said, snorting resentfully, but I felt a damp tangle

of uncertainty in my chest. Had I actually guffawed as Hannah smacked her cane

across the boy's startled head? Had we, father and daughter, then stood

snickering in the moonlight as he reeled up the street toward home? "Of course

not," I said. "But even if we had, I'm not sure I'd apologize for it. Our

culture has made female victimization the stuff of comedy for years. I'd think

you would appreciate women's appropriation of aggressive humor--it's Thelma and

Louise, La Femme Nikita."<p>



"Great role models," Greta said. "Lovely women."<p>



But I could see that the conversation had taken an odd turn, had progressed in

such a way that Greta now found herself on the opposite end of the court from

where she usually played, awkwardly having to question the subversion of gender

roles, the physical assertion of women.<p>



"Hannah's four years old," I said. "How was she to know that ax wasn't real?

I'd think any reflex of self-defense should be encouraged."<p>



"That's such crap, Joe," Greta said, standing now, attempting, I imagined, to

gain authority. "Just last week you were arguing that urban violence"--and here

she lowered her voice, set her jaw forward, spoke in a nasal, pompous tone that

was meant to parody mine--"<i>codes of reciprocal violence</i>,' could be

broken only if someone had the perspective to walk away, to not respond. Now

you're saying that we should encourage our daughter to bash heads?"<p>



"Of course not," I said, now standing too, secretly pleased that Greta had

actually been paying attention to my spiel the week before. "But <i>offing</i>

someone for scuffing your Nikes is different from defending yourself from

physical attack."<p>



"But she wasn't being attacked! This is Halloween! The neighborhood is filled

with costumed kids trying to be scary."<p>



"Aha!" I shouted, and Greta shushed me and glared and pointed at the ceiling,

to Hannah's upstairs bedroom. I ducked my head, a gesture of contrition, and

repeated, softly, "Aha. Just a minute ago you were saying that this was 'real

life,' not a B-movie scene."<p>





"Exactly," Greta said. "And so Hannah needs to be able to distinguish between

an actual and an imagined threat, because her hitting someone over the head has

real consequences--that's real life."<p>



For an instant I felt muddled, confused, in danger of losing the point before

this subtle equivocation. "Well," I said cautiously, "that's asking a lot from

a four-year-old. We don't even expect that sort of discrimination from cops

confronted by toy guns."<p>



"Well, maybe we should," she said, and turned and walked toward the kitchen.<p>



I stood there gnashing my teeth, feeling cheated. Greta should have been

pleased that Hannah had taken a cane to a monster's head. This, after all, was

the same woman who, upon hearing that an Ecuadorian hairdresser had lopped off

the penis of her abusive husband, simply raised her eyebrows and nodded.<p>



One of my students once told me that the older his parents grew, the more like

themselves they became, and I thought at the time that that was as precise an

observation on aging as I had come across: eventually we become caricatures of

ourselves--our ears and noses enlarging, our fears and biases assuming

grotesque, exaggerated proportions, our quirks becoming habitual, predictable,

farcical. But Greta was moving in the opposite direction, becoming less like

herself, and I was still stumbling after her, trying to figure out just who she

was.<p>



I once lay in bed and watched her as she slept, her mouth slack and pale on the

pillow; her eyelids blue-veined, translucent, puffy from slumber; an

astonishing growth of blonde down on her cheek and jawline. I marveled at the

idea that she was mine, my woman, my wife, the mother of my child, that we

lived together but that essentially I didn't know her--I had just come upon

her, a stranger, and had taken her home, so to speak, and here she was in my

bed, alive and inscrutable. I felt a vague sense of the kind of terror one

might feel if he were suddenly to discover that he had been living for years

with an undomesticated and dangerous animal.<p>



<br>

<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/I-small.gif" align=left 

height=44 alt="I"></font><sp> HAUL the sack of grass clippings around the side of the garage and return to

the mower. Hannah has vanished from the porch window into the depths of the

house, taking Ryan Ray with her, perhaps, or, I hope, leaving him outside to

fend for himself. I start the mower and watch it expel a cloud of dust and

white smoke, and I begin fighting it up a steep incline toward the back fence.

I smell my own breath, stale, heavy, coming in wheezing drafts beneath my mask;

taste blood on my teeth; feel chapped lips.<p>



As I wheel the mower around and begin my descent from the hill, I see Greta

standing on the patio, waving. She has a bit of a scowl on her face, and I feel

a sudden wash of anxiety. I try to recall if I've committed a crime recently. I

am struck by the audacity of men who keep mistresses or steal inheritances and

continue living with their wives, unaffected, going through the motions of

marriage as if blameless. I kill the engine and walk toward her, pulling down

my mask and pushing back my ball cap.<p>



Greta invites me to sit on one of the patio chairs. She drags and scrapes hers

over to me, so that when she sits, our knees are touching.<p>



"I've just had a conversation with Hannah," she says. "A boy in her preschool

class wants, she says, to 'sax' her."<p>



For an odd instant I think of Bill Clinton, in coat and tie and sunglasses,

blowing the saxophone on the Arsenio Hall show. "What?" I ask, though I know

exactly where she's going with this.<p>



"There's this boy, Freddie McGuirk, and he's been trying to hug Hannah on the

playground. During nap time he'll reach over and touch her and say that he

wants to 'sax' her."<p>



"Where does he touch her?" I ask, leaning forward.<p>



Greta nods. "Just on the arm. But she's pretty upset by it. She wanted to know

what 'sax' means."<p>



<img src="Desk.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>



I feel a clutching at my heart. I want to hunt down this Freddie McGuirk and

his father, who, I imagine, is a fat, beer-drunk auto worker. He'll wobble to

his front door wearing a T-shirt that rides up on his white gut, holding a can

of Old Milwaukee in his greasy hand, and Freddie will be standing behind him,

peering up at me with his filthy street urchin's face. "Are you Mr. McGuirk?"

I'll ask, clenching my teeth, balling my fist at my side. And in the instant he

nods, I'll club him with a left hook. As he crumples, I'll lift Freddie by the

throat and say, "Look, you little son of a bitch, if you ever touch or speak to

my daughter again, I'll break your stinking little neck."<p>



"I've made an appointment to see Rachel tomorrow afternoon at four," Greta

says. Rachel is the director of the pre-school, a tall blonde woman in on whom

I once walked as she sat on the toilet--her blue panties coiled about her

knees, her legs long and remarkably tan--while I was wandering the hallways,

looking at crayon drawings and waiting for Hannah to find her backpack. "Oh,

God, I'm sorry," I cried, slamming the door shut and standing on the other

side, weak with surprise. "That's okay," she shouted. "We take the locks off

all the doors, though we try to teach the children to knock before they open

one." "Of course," I said, and crept away, crouching a bit beneath the weight

of her rebuke.<p>



"Can you be there?" Greta asks.<p>



"Of course," I say.<p>



"Good. Rachel's going to invite the McGuirks, too. We need to take care of

this."<p>



We sit there, our knees touching, looking at each other. "What did you tell

Hannah?"<p>





Greta sighs. "I tried to distinguish good touching from bad touching," she

says, narrowing her eyes in recollection. "I asked her how she felt when her

friend Mason hugged her, and she said 'Happy,' and how she felt when Freddie

McGuirk hugged her, and she said 'Yucky.' I told her that she never had to let

anyone hug her or touch her who made her feel that way, yucky; that her body

was hers and that certain parts of her body"--and here Greta, with childlike

intensity, points to her own--"like her breasts and her genitals, are

especially private." <p>



She sighs again and shifts around in her chair. "And then I thought, Oh,

Christ, I'm going to make her afraid of the doctor or ultimately frigid or

something, so I told her that sometimes she might have to be touched there--by

Dr. Marks, for instance--to see if she's healthy and all, but that she should

always tell us if <i>anyone</i> touches her and makes her feel funny or

uncomfortable. I told her that someday, when she's <i>much</i>, <i>much</i>

older, she might be in love and want someone to touch her to give her pleasure,

because the body is a wonderful thing, but is only shared willingly, with

permission. And that is what sex is, but the yucky feeling isn't sex at

all--it's violence or meanness or something." Greta reaches up and covers her

face with her hands. "Oh, God. I don't know what I said. I've probably screwed

her up for life." <p>



I touch her shoulder. "No, hey, no," I say. "That was perfect. It was great,

really."<p>



Greta drops her hands and stands abruptly. "I'm going inside. You can finish

mowing." And she turns, pushes and scrapes her chair back into place, and walks

to the patio door.<p>



"Hey, Greta," I call, and she turns to face me. I hesitate, wanting to say the

right thing. "You know, she's lucky to have a mother like you." For an instant

Greta's eyes seem to blur, and then she gives me the finger and tells me, not

unkindly, to get back to work.<p>



While I'm mowing again, stumbling back and forth across the lawn, I recall that

just a few months earlier Hannah came home from preschool smelling of the

outdoors, of playground dust and wind, flushed and jumpy with excitement

because they were learning "Spanish" in her class. She demonstrated--held her

hands carefully before her chest and manipulated her fingers--and I laughed and

said, "Signing. You're learning to sign." And she looked at me as if I might be

trying to confuse her, and cautiously nodded her head and said, "Uh-huh," and

continued working her fingers, an expression of deliberate modesty on her face.

I think about this and find myself breathing quickly, shallowly. I have to stop

the mower and stand there, absurdly, in the middle of our tidy back yard,

panting as if I were about to die.<p>

<br>



<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif" align=left 

height=44 alt="T"></font>HAT evening, after her bath, Hannah comes into my 	study to say good-night.

She is wearing a yellow cotton nightie with blue-bowed teddy bears on it, and

she stands before me, her cheeks scrubbed and pink and her damp hair combed

back. She reaches up to me and I kiss her--a short, loving smack. I hold her

tightly, breathe her soapy scent, feel her ribs beneath my hands. She is

growing taller, leaner, her body lengthening from toddler squatness. I slide my

hand along her sloping back and begin to pat her bottom and find myself

hesitating, considering for a confused instant how she might interpret my

touch. Then I grow flushed with sudden anger and shame that I would even be

thinking this, scrutinizing gestures of affection. She rescues me, returns me

to innocence, by tugging me closer, pressing her mouth to my whiskery cheek and

chanting, "Good night, Daddy-bo-batty," inviting me to respond, "Good night,

Hannah-banana"--the liturgy of nonsense love, of untethered hearts. <p>



That night I rise from bed three times to make my way to the kitchen, where I

sloppily drink cold tap water, trying to quench a thirst that hangs stubbornly

in the back of my throat. Each time, as I retreat, I am momentarily touched by

an odd, dreamy sense of well-being, as if I had been returned to childhood and,

creeping the darkened hall from the bathroom, could hear my father's rhythmic

snores in the distance. I recall the limey scent of his skin, his hairy,

muscled arms lax against the sheets, his body curved toward my mother--a stay

against night terrors. I feel this each time and then am struck with the

realization that he does not live here, that I am the father, the protector. I

am vaguely frightened as I crawl into bed again, lie on my back and feel my

weight sagging into the mattress, recollect my graying temples, my aging body,

within which on such nights I attempt to still the panicked rushing of my

childish blood. <p>



<br>

	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/M-small.gif" align=left 

height=44 alt="M"></font>ONDAY afternoon I leave campus early and drive to La Petite Academy. In the

fenced playground a loose throng of shouting boys rushes about madly, changes

direction suddenly, instinctively, like a school of fish or a herd of

wildebeests. Small clusters of girls busily attend to other matters, scooping

sand into buckets and bowls, speaking urgently to one another in cartoon-mouse

voices. Drifting among these children are two giants: Mathilda, a middle-aged

woman with freckled arms and prodigious, matriarchal breasts; and Jennifer, an

athletic college girl with a dark ponytail and sunglasses, who, it is rumored,

while spending the previous summer as a nanny in New England allowed the

children's gray-haired father into her borrowed bed on a regular, comfortable

basis.<p>



"Hi, Professor Shoe!" she calls, waving and walking toward me. Behind her I see

Hannah's blonde head rise suddenly from a pack of playmates and search the air

for my presence, a cub sniffing the wind. When she sees me, she shouts "Daddy!"

and charges past Jennifer to meet me at the gate. After a cheerful collision

she abruptly turns serious. <p>



"Come see what we found," she says, her lower lip thrust forward dolefully.<p>



But Jennifer is before us now, and so I stand. "I will, sweetheart. Just a

minute."<p>



"Hi," Jennifer says, adjusting her sunglasses, crinkling her nose. "How are you

doing?" <p>



"Just fine, thanks, Jennifer. How are you?"<p>



"Fine," she says, nodding. A hot-pink fever blister is budding on the corner of

her mouth. "Just fine."<p>



Hannah is following the exchange, holding my hand, her face tipped upward and

one eye squinting into the sun.<p>



"The kids found a dead bird," Jennifer says. "They're going to give it a

funeral. Right, Hannah?"<p>



Hannah nods.<p>



"Really?" I say, but I am watching the rushing boys, particularly one who seems

to be the leader. He is scuffed and aggressive, wears a red crewcut, and

bullies the other boys with his elbows. "Who's that?" I ask casually. I imagine

him at nap time, running his scaly hand up my daughter's leg. "The one with the

red hair and the Ninja Turtle T-shirt."<p>



"Perry Gee," Jennifer says.<p>



My heart dips in disappointment, but I continue asking names until ultimately,

because I'm having no luck and the game is growing tiresome, I ask which boy is

Ryan Ray.<p>



At this Jennifer peers over the top of her sunglasses at the children,

frowning, repeating the name silently, and Hannah relaxes her hold on my hand.

She looks at the children too, but vaguely, nibbling on her lower lip. Then I

realize my mistake, and I scoop Hannah up into my arms, holding her as if she

might be snatched from me on the heels of this betrayal.<p>



"Sorry. Never mind," I say. "I was thinking of a boy in our neighborhood."<p>



Jennifer nods and licks her fever blister distractedly. Hannah leans into me

and whispers in my ear, "Come see what we found." And I go happily, as light as

the newly forgiven.<p>



At four o'clock Greta arrives, stern and striking in her black business suit,

and she and I walk to the main building. Its cavernous interior is cool and

smells of construction paper and paste. We click along the hallway to Rachel's

office, my stomach doing slow revolutions and feeding a thickness in my throat.

Rachel meets us at the door and invites us in. A rumpled-looking couple is

already present, sitting on a vinyl couch and whispering conspiratorially.<p>



"Joe and Greta Shoe, this is Gene and Linda McGuirk," Rachel announces,

gesturing gracefully, first to us and then to the McGuirks, who rise hurriedly,

knocking into each other, bobbing their heads and smiling and extending their

hands. He is a short, ruddy, walleyed man with an unfortunate moustache and a

pinkie ring. For an instant I am bolstered by the thought that if it came to

it, I could beat him in a fistfight. She is taller than he by half a foot, but

thin and pale and trying self-consciously to smile without revealing a pair of

coffee-stained buck teeth.<p>



"Hi, nice to meet you," we say to each other, everyone shaking hands clumsily.

I resist the urge to turn at last to Greta and shake her hand too, do a shtick,

vent the fear and violence in my heart.<p>



"Please, everyone, have a seat," Rachel says. She will be the moderator, the

voice of reason.<p>



I sit in a fat upholstered chair whose seat cushion collapses at the rear, so

that I am pinched, knees high, childish in the company of adults. While Rachel

speaks, I stealthily wrestle my way forward until I'm on the chair's edge,

magically dignified again.<p>



"Now, we're here today because we're all concerned about some interaction

taking place between Hannah and Freddie."<p>



The McGuirks nod emphatically, ready to confess sin. Greta sits with her chin

propped elegantly in her hand, staring at Rachel, unblinking.<p>



"As you all know," Rachel continues, "Freddie has apparently been touching

Hannah and making inappropriate suggestions about sex."<p>



As Rachel says this, I not only re-experience my initial outrage but

also--oddly, deplorably--feel a sudden interest in her legs, which are slender

and dark, touching at the knees and sloping smoothly to her crossed ankles. <p>



"I know that Joe and Greta have talked with Hannah about this and explained,

though probably earlier than they would have liked"--she pauses to smile

sympathetically at us--"what sex is and what constitutes its proper

boundaries." She shifts her attention to the McGuirks and leans forward; the

hem of her skirt rides provocatively up her thigh. "But I don't know if Gene

and Linda have had a chance to speak to Freddie yet."<p>



The McGuirks appear surprised, as if they had been caught napping, and then

they both begin speaking at once, he nervously fingering his sparse moustache

and she holding her hand protectively before her mouth.<p>



"I got home late last night, so Fred was asleep when I got home," he mumbles.<p>



"It's his brother," she moans. "He tells him things a little boy shouldn't

know."<p>



"And then of course I had to leave the house early this morning."<p>



"He shows him nasty pictures. I know he does."<p>



Rachel is listening attentively, her dark, thin-plucked brows knit. Beneath her

blonde hair are the roots of a brunette. I replay the bathroom scene from the

year before, seeing her perched on the toilet, facing me, her sandaled feet

pigeon-toed, her knees bound by blue panties, those long legs naked and brown.

Had I seen a pale bikini line? A tufted shadow? My pulse trips and quickens at

the prospect, but then slows as I recall her dress heaped modestly on her lap,

my own quick and remorseful exit. <i>Oh,</i> <i>God</i>, <i>I'm sorry</i>.<p>



"But, boy, I'm going to talk to him tonight!" Mr. McGuirk declares, banging his

plump fist on one knee. Mrs. McGuirk stretches her lip over her teeth and nods

in agreement.<p>



I am horrified by my inability to concentrate on this matter. I recall that two

nights before, while watching on CNN a weeping victim of natural disaster, a

Missouri farm wife who had lost her home and hundreds of acres to spring

floods, I realized I was only admiring the tangled sweep of her hair, the

sensual arc of her trembling lip. I fled to my study, to my books, seeking

redemption, trusting that reading would check my lust, bring me closer to God.

<p>



Greta folds her hands beneath her chin, extending the index fingers and

touching them at their tips. "I just think it's unfortunate that children can't

be children longer than this," she says. "Not that they shouldn't be aware of

their bodies and sexual difference and even desire, but that they should have

to begin thinking and worrying about aggression at this age--how to cope with

it. I just think it's unfortunate." And then, as an afterthought, "God knows,

once you enter that world, you're in it the rest of your life." <p>



The ambiguity of this remark, its confessional tone, startles me. While Rachel

and Linda McGuirk nod empathetically, I imagine that Gene and I are crouching

outside their circle, hulking, rapacious, mouth-breathing and hairy-backed.<p>



"Yes," I announce a bit too loudly, "I'm uncomfortable too with the idea that

children should be forced to negotiate the rituals and prohibitions of

sexuality, to enter into the sexual politics of adults."<p>



Everyone looks at me dumbly except Greta, who is concentrating on a loose

thread in the hem of her skirt, smoothing it meticulously with her finger. I

suddenly feel ludicrous and hot.<p>



Eventually, when we have all agreed that Freddie will be spoken to, that we are

reasonable people and can teach our children to behave properly, we stand and

shake hands again. Greta and I follow the McGuirks to the door, taking our

time, hanging back, so that we won't have to make small talk with them in the

corridor.<p>



In the parking lot we see them walking with a thin, blond-haired boy with

owlish glasses and enormous pink ears. "<i>That's</i> Freddie?" I ask. This

child, I recall, was not part of that stampeding herd of boys; rather, he sat

by himself on a swing, twisting and spiraling slowly, dragging his heels in the

sand, staring contemplatively at the sky.<p>



"Evidently," Greta says. She seems tired, or sad.<p>



"Hey, are you okay?" I take her elbow, slowing our pace.<p>



"Uh-huh." She looks at me and smiles, and I feel lightened by this act of

generosity, pleased that I have not somehow disappointed her.<p>



I watch the McGuirks approach their car--a white Ford Escort that's missing a

hubcap. I watch as Gene secures Freddie in the back seat, jauntily rounds the

trunk to the passenger's side and opens the door for Linda, places his hand

gently on the small of her sweat-dampened back, closes the door firmly. Seamus

Heaney once wrote about such gestures, the banalities of affection and care,

"Here is love like a tinsmith's scoop sunk past its gleam in the meal-bin," and

I think of this as Gene returns to the driver's side, trying to conceal a bit

of a limp, his trousers too short, his shoes scuffed and thinning at the

soles.<p>

<br>



	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif" align=left 

height=44 alt="T"></font>HAT night Hannah calls Greta from our bed to hers. 	Mom," she cries, her voice

small and fragile in the darkness. "Mom."<p>



I wait a few minutes, my feelings hurt, and then follow to her bedroom and

stand quietly outside the door. I am old and goatish in my boxers. I am growing

hair in improbable places.<p>



I see Greta's silhouette on the edge of Hannah's bed; she is speaking quietly,

stroking Hannah's hair.<p>



"Mom, are you going to die?" Hannah asks. <p>



The suddenness of this question shocks me, dislodging something. I want to step

into the room, turn on the light, and say, "No, of course not. Go to sleep

now." But in the concentrated stillness I hear Greta say yes, she will die

someday--that people die, and because she is older than Hannah, she will

probably die first.<p>



Just like that.<p>



Then there is quiet again, a broad, dark space within which they are surely

watching each other, carefully, seriously, Greta stroking Hannah's hair, their

hearts beating slowly, making necessary adjustments.<p>



"I'm really going to miss you," Hannah says finally. The declaration is so

clear that I lose my breath before it and must turn and make my way weakly back

to bed. <p>



When Greta returns, she tiptoes past me--her ankles cracking, the floorboards

creaking--to our bathroom, closes the door, and turns on the light. From the

bed I hear water rushing in the sink, and behind it what sounds like the muted

gasps of someone struggling for air. <p><br>





	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/F-small.gif" align=left 

height=44 alt="F"></font>RIDAY night at dinner Hannah announces the demise of Ryan Ray. We are eating

fried chicken and she is swaying side to side, as if to music, holding a

drumstick delicately with both hands.<p>



"What happened?" I ask.<p>



She licks her shiny upper lip. "A piano fell on his noggin," she says, and then

stretches her arm upward and lets her hand fall to her head. "Bonk!" she

cries.<p>



Greta and I look at each other. "Yikes," we say together. Greta kicks me under

the table. "Owe me a Coke."<p>



Synchronic utterances, I think, bode well, suggesting sturdy symmetry, the

binding of lives.<p>



In the fourth year of our marriage my sister Susan came to visit for a weekend,

and after a night of barhopping we returned jovially to our apartment, where

Greta scooped the startled Molly, our cat, into her arms, cradling and stroking

her until she ceased her nettled mews, closed her eyes, and rumbled and purred

with pleasure. I sat beside them, my arm around Greta's shoulders, my free hand

pressing Molly's paw, which clenched and unclenched with voluptuous rhythm,

exposing and retracting dangerous curving claws.<p>



Susan stood teetering before us, smiling mawkishly. "You two are going to make

such good parents," she moaned. And even then, at that moment, we recognized

the absurdity of the pronouncement--knew that our lives were so muddled and

treacherous that even the harmonized coddling of a cat could not last long.<p>



"Right," Greta said, and opened her arms to let Molly drop to the floor, feet

first. The cat walked away, her tail swishing peevishly.<p>



"Bonk! Bonk! Bonk!" Hannah cries, smacking the top of her head with her open

hand.<p>



"You're going to get grease in your hair," Greta says. She extends a napkin and

then snatches it away each time Hannah reaches for it. Plucking at air, Hannah

shrieks with laughter. I stretch my leg beneath the table and touch Greta's

foot with my instep, and because she leaves it there for me to stroke blindly,

monkeylike, I feel my heart bloom, and I smell spring beyond the open windows.

<blockquote>

<font size=5>D</font>avid Schiff, whose <A 
HREF="../../95sep/boulez.htm">music 
essays</A> have appeared in <I>The Atlantic Monthly </I>for several years, 
writes with a composer's ear: when he isn't writing, teaching at Reed 
College, in Portland, Oregon, where his courses touch on all kinds of 
music, or conducting the Reed undergraduate orchestra, he is composing.  
His opera <I>Gimpel the Fool </I>has been produced six times, and he is at 
work on concertos for jazz violin and viola.<p>

Schiff is a born New Yorker (he was educated at Columbia, the Manhattan 
School of Music, and Juilliard), and the city's rhythms appear both in his 
prose and in his music. So do Jewish themes. <A 
HREF="../everyman/everyman.htm">This month Schiff shows how 
Irving Berlin's immersion in American culture helped to transform a 
Russian Jewish immigrant into the nation's chief anthem maker.</A> His new 
viola concerto, inspired by klezmer music, is based on a fable of a cantor 
who leaves nineteenth-century Poland to seek fame and fortune in Western 
Europe and, to his ultimate destruction, finds it. <p>
Currently Schiff is revising his award-winning book <I>The Music of 
Elliott Carter </I>(1983), examining the works that Carter, under whom 
Schiff studied, has written since the book was published. And he is 
writing a book on George Gershwin's <I>Rhapsody in Blue</I>. The new book 
grew out of Schiff's June, 1993, <I>Atlantic </I>cover story on Leonard 
Bernstein. In his research Schiff found that Bernstein bore a grudge 
against <I>Rhapsody in Blue</I>: "He said it was just a collection of 
tunes, and you could rearrange it in any order--he accused it of 
having no musical form." Through imaginative reconstruction based on what 
he calls "sleuthing," Schiff is composing source material like what 
Gershwin might have drawn on--his musical trunk of ideas--in order 
to explain how Gershwin could have composed the piece so "artfully" in a 
matter of weeks.<p>
"I love writing for the theater," Schiff says, by way of introducing a 
piece of music he recently and very reluctantly abandoned. This one 
contained little of New York and nothing Jewish: Schiff and the librettist 
Stuart Flack imagine a meeting between Wallace Stevens and Charles Ives on 
a train back from the 1935 Harvard-Yale game. The two couldn't find anyone 
to commission it, though: "No sex, no violence, and two middle-aged men as 
heroes." Schiff seems as adept at straddling cultures as the composers he 
writes about. We're betting he'll find a taker.<p>

<blockquote>





	<font size=5>D</font>O pop tunes have an afterlife? A new three-volume scholarly edition of the

early songs of Irving Berlin, published for the American Musicological Society,

suggests that all music, whether pop or classical, passes from inspiration to

dissertation, living on as fodder for musicologists. <p>



I recently decided to test Berlin's suitability for the full scholarly

treatment in the privacy of my home. As I began singing and playing through all

190 of these songs, written from 1907 to 1914, I thought I had finally

discovered the secret to being the life of the party. The first few songs, for

which Berlin wrote the words only, had an irresistible klutzy charm in their

rhymes:<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

Oh Marie, 'neath the window I'm waiting<br>

Oh, Marie, please don't be so aggravating . . .

<p>



Impatiently I wait for thee here in the moonlight,<br>

Don't be afraid, my dusky maid, this is a spoonlight . . . <p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





I hit pay dirt with the seventh song, "Sadie Salome (Go Home)"<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

Don't do that dance, I tell you Sadie,<br>

That's not a bus'ness for a lady!<br>

'Most ev'rybody knows<br>

That I'm your loving Mose,<br>

Oy, oy, oy, oy<br>

Where is your clothes?<br>

You better go and get your dresses,<br>

Ev'ry one's got the op'ra glasses.<br>

Oy! such a sad disgrace<br>

No one looks in your face;<br>

Sadie Salome, go home.<br>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





Mel Brooks could not have undone Richard Strauss any better. I was ready to

invite all my friends over. <p>



Pounding on through the sixty songs of Volume I, I soon found I wasn't having

fun anymore. It was a long, long haul through a slew of forgettable "coon"

songs, "kike" songs, "guinea" songs, and "kraut" songs to get to "Alexander's

Ragtime Band." There are no forgotten musical gems here. Out of 190 songs you

may know only "Alexander" and "Everybody's Doing It Now"--and you probably have

to be at least fifty to remember the second, either with its original lyrics or

with the raunchier street lyrics I learned as a kid in the post-Second World

War Bronx.<p>



In his introduction to <i>Irving Berlin: Early Songs</i>, the musicologist

Charles Hamm provides an exhaustive guide to the songs, breaking them into

categories (ballads, novelty songs, ragtime songs, show songs) and

subcategories (high-class, rustic, domestic) with the acuity of a structural

anthropologist. He makes no claim for their musical value: this edition is

clearly meant as a form of musical archaeology, taking us back to the

prehistory of pop music. <p>



<IMG SRC="./Music.gif" ALT=" " ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="253" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10">



And once you become acculturated, these songs can seem closer in spirit to

today's popular music than to that of the "golden age." Most of them are

mechanical, vulgar, stereotype-ridden, and sexually suggestive. They take place

in the amoral anomie of the modern city, where a man can send his wife to the

country ("Hurrah! Hurrah!") and think about making love to his secretary. It's

a world of distinct ethnic enclaves, each with its own predictable dialect and

obsessions. Jews are all named Mose and Sadie and think only about money.

Italians talk-a like dis. Blacks strut their stuff and roll their eyes, singing

of dear ol' Dixie. Offensive? Yes, but with minor alterations they sound like

proto-MTV. The prehistory of pop music is a lot like its post-history.<p>



<font size=5>J</font>EROME Kern once wrote that Irving Berlin was not part of American music--he

was American music. It was a generous compliment, but wrong. Berlin cannot be

made to stand for all of American song. Yet it would be equally misguided to

view him as a kind of classical composer and study his complete works in order

to trace his personal artistic development. A printed overview of Berlin's

oeuvre may in fact obscure the vital connections to other songwriters and

performers who were essential to the existence of popular song. It will,

however, provide clues to the mysterious character of the songs' creator. <p>



Irving Berlin eventually earned a reputation for being the premier American

tunesmith, mainly because he kept writing hits over five decades, and also

because so many of his songs--"God Bless America," "White Christmas," "Easter

Parade," "Oh How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning," "There's No Business Like

Show Business"--became quasi-official national anthems. These songs seem to

have been written for Everyman, by Everyman. Their author seems invisible,

inscrutable, without a definable style or voice. Alec Wilder, in his great

study <i>The American Popular Song</i>, nails down the idiosyncrasies of Jerome

Kern, George Gershwin, and Richard Rodgers, but throws up his hands in

attempting to find Berlin's musical fingerprints. Berlin was the Homer of the

pop tune, and also its Zelig. Perhaps the early songs provide a key to his

ubiquitous anonymity; in any case they reveal something about our evolving

national identity. Berlin--as much as the moguls of Hollywood, some of whom

were his childhood friends from the Lower East Side--created a new American

landscape and then disappeared into it.<p>



Before I read the excellent biography of Berlin by Laurence Bergreen (<i>As

Thousands Cheer </i>) and the loving, intimate memoir by Berlin's daughter Mary

Ellin Barrett, I had formed my own picture of him, based on the songs and on

Abraham Cahan's great 1890s novel, <i>The Rise of David Levinsky </i>(a

favorite, by the way, of the lyricist Ira Gershwin). Cahan tells the story of a

Russian immigrant who achieves success in America by completely destroying his

inner life; he becomes a shell, relentless in his business pursuits and

incapable of any feelings--and yet not a monster. <p>



Berlin did not lack for emotions, but he had no problem exploiting them either.

When his first wife died, shortly after they married, he wrote "When I Lost

You," a sad waltz that, Bergreen says, "was the only song Berlin ever admitted

had a basis in the events of his life." When it became a hit, he started

turning out sappy waltzes by the yard, most of them forgettable, but others,

such as "Always" and "What'll I Do?" and "All Alone," even bigger hits than

"When I Lost You." <p>



Berlin's rise from poverty was even more astonishing than Levinsky's. Starting

with nothing on the Lower East Side, sleeping in flophouses on the Bowery, he

earned a vast fortune by the time he was thirty and married Ellin McKay, the

daughter of one of the richest men in America. Although he never lost his East

Side accent, he assumed the privileges of wealth as one to the manner born; his

daughter describes a life of quiet, tasteful luxury marred only by her father's

long bouts of depression, during which he would become even more invisible than

usual, shutting himself off even from his family. <p>



<font size=5>B</font>ERLIN'S success, unlike Levinsky's, depended on more than hard work and

business acumen--though in his life there was plenty of each. Born in Russia,

with Yiddish as his first language, Berlin was to use language itself as the

medium of his self-invention. Language for him was not something fixed and

traditional; it was an assemblage of exploitable accidents. According to

legend, even his name was the result of a typographic decision. A publisher

reduced his first name to "I." on the cover of the sheet music of his first

song, "Marie From Sunny Italy," which led the nineteen-year-old Israel Baline

to re-create himself with the names of an American author and a German city far

from the Russian shtetl of his birth. He simultaneously took on the airs of old

Knickerbocker New York and of the uptown German Jews who had already

assimilated into American society. <p>



Like Ira Gershwin and Groucho Marx, Berlin heard English through the ears of an

immigrant for whom sound and sense were in a state of constant recombination. I

suspect that even before they learned English, many Jewish lyricists had

experienced another culturally specific linguistic subversion. In Hebrew

schools, then as today, the language of the prayer book was learned

syllabically, with exercises in which arbitrary combinations of consonants and

vowels only gradually turn into words: <i>bah, baw, beh, bu, bi, boo</i>.

Students rapidly manipulate sound symbols that are completely detached from

meaning; many learn their prayers with no idea of what the words mean. No

wonder they can develop a sense for interlinguistic puns and internal rhymes

that native speakers never notice.<p>



As Philip Furia shows in his eye-opening book <i>The Poets of Tin Pan

Alley</i>, Berlin's contribution to the American language was "ragged" rhyme, a

mating of the immigrant's fractured perception of English sounds with the

dislocated rhythms of ragtime.<p>

Furia connects Berlin's assault on language with the techniques of the imagist

poets. The fusion of Yiddish rap and African-American ragtime turned out to be

the decisive step in the emergence of Berlin's nondenominational, non-ethnic

American identity, and also in the emergence of a new kind of national song

literature. As many critics have noted, "Alexander's Ragtime Band" is not

ragtime, and it appeared after the ragtime craze was over. But it transformed

ragtime, a regional and ethnic music, into a definition of American identity.<p>



The ups and downs of popularity could be a heavy burden for a composer. From

his daughter's memoir I learned that Berlin was a poker player, and it occurred

to me that his appearance of impersonality may have been a protective mask--a

poker face. A songwriter has to live with the luck of the draw, and when Berlin

went hitless he would fall into deep depression. It must have been unsettling

to write so many songs and have some of them --thirty, say, out of

thousands--become hits while most of the others soon vanished. Berlin was not

naive (he was part of the Algonquin Round Table), and he certainly had his

formulas. He claimed, with the appearance of false modesty, that there were

just six Berlin songs, with endless variants. And he knew when he had a sure

winner, such as "White Christmas," which he announced to friends was the

greatest song ever written. Yet in general the fate of songs is as

unpredictable as the public mood. Believing that the quality of a song was

measured solely by its popularity, Berlin suffered from the very mystique that

made him a national hero.<p>



<font size=5>I</font> WOULD like to think that the reason for the success and staying power of so

many of Berlin's songs was his skill, even genius, as a songwriter. Why do the

best ones live on to the extent that they do? And what about them is unique to

Berlin? In spite of Alec Wilder's bewilderment and Charles Hamm's indifference,

it is possible to get at the intrinsic quality of Berlin's songs. <p>



Let's start with some of the facts of Berlin's creative life. He and Cole

Porter were the only great songsmiths to write both music and lyrics; as most

of Volume I of <i>Irving Berlin: Early Songs </i>shows, Berlin began as a

lyricist. It's well known that though he was no concert pianist, he could get

around the piano, but only in the key of F sharp (on the black keys). He could

neither write down nor harmonize his songs--he could barely even sing them.

Throughout his life he depended on copyists and harmonists, who never claimed

that they had composed the songs themselves, and attested to the fact that

Berlin knew what he wanted harmonically when he heard it. <p>



For Berlin, then, a song was a wedding of words and melody. This may seem

self-evident, but it is quite different from the case of, for example, George

Gershwin, who always wrote the melody first and was deeply interested in

harmony. A great Gershwin song--"Nice Work If You Can Get It," for example--is

as much a harmonic composition as a melody. To understand its structure one has

to look at the elegant contrapuntal relation between the melody notes and the

bass. <p>



In contrast, Berlin's right hand did not know what his left hand was doing; he

was a pure melodist. If you play through Berlin's songs, you soon find that

many are ineptly harmonized, often with the bass simply doubling the melody.

Even "Blue Skies," which is built on a solid descending bass line, loses its

focus in the bridge. And yet it would be a mistake to say that Berlin's songs

lack musical discoveries--just listen to the way "Always" swerves out of key in

the eleventh bar of the chorus ("need a helping hand, I will understand") and

suavely finds its way back three bars later ("always, always"). That kind of

harmonic surprise is really a melodic invention--Berlin just took the ninth and

tenth bars of his tune and moved them up two steps. The harmony had to tag

along behind melodic intensification. <p>



Berlin was famous for composing at a piano that allowed him to change keys

while always playing in F sharp. I think the picture of him hunting and pecking

on the black keys may be misleading, though. His songs are full of accidentals

and out-of-key turns that he could not have played on the black keys alone

--and it's hard to imagine that he discovered them by manipulating the pedals

that moved his keyboard from one key to another. I assume that like most

composers, Berlin composed with his brain as well as his fingers, and that he

figured out how to use his keyboard to find melodies he had already composed in

his head. The shapes of these melodies reveal Berlin's distinctive genius:

because he did not have a conscious command of harmony, he had to make his

melodic lines all the stronger.<p>



Berlin brought his idiosyncratic technique to the most rigorously circumscribed

musical and poetic form since the days of the troubadours or the great haiku

poets. The tunesmith had to say "I love you" in just thirty-two bars, divided

squarely into four eight-bar groups, and the melody had to be singable and

memorable. Its range could not exceed an octave by much, and it had to have a

"hook" that would set it apart from other songs. <p>



The words were just as tightly prescribed as the music. Berlin usually set

himself a double task in the lyrics: his songs have a verbal tag and tell a

story. Usually the tag is a casual phrase: "What'll I do?," "Let's have another

cup o' coffee," "Come on and hear," "God bless America." Berlin's first

inspiration as a composer, I suspect, was the rhythm of the tag. He had a

genius for giving common American phrases the nervous musical impulse of the

modern city. Over and over he discovered the syncopation in ordinary speech

rhythms: "Anything you can do I can do better." (As an aside, I'll note that

today's music has singularly failed to bring contemporary English to a similar

state of life--a failure symbolic, perhaps, of larger failures.)<p>



Once he had his tag in place, Berlin could begin to tell a tale. Most of the

early songs are really nothing but vaudeville vignettes, presented in the

opening section, or verse, and punctuated by a refrain, or chorus, on which the

audience probably joined in. "My Wife's Gone to the Country (Hurrah! Hurrah!)"

unfolds a surprising story of extramarital liberation. Brown's wife leaves home

with the children to escape a heat wave. Brown takes out an ad in the newspaper

announcing the fact, and then sings it into a recording phonograph, rips down

"GOD BLESS OUR HOME" from the wall, tells his friend Molly "I love my wife, but

oh! you kid," and, when he starts to lose his voice, teaches a parrot to sing

the joyous refrain. It's a strangely self-reflective plot: the husband does not

turn into a philanderer, he turns into a songwriter, and his story becomes the

song. As in many of Berlin's songs, music, rather than being the vehicle for

emotional expression, is both the source and the outcome of the emotion.<p>



Berlin's later songs, like most popular tunes of the twenties and on, have

verses that are shriveled into mere introductions and choruses that are the

heart of the composition. Here the story had to be told within the strict shape

of the main melody, and so every note counted. "All Alone" is an object lesson

in how to tell a story in four melodic phrases. One: "I'm alone." Two: "Waiting

by the phone." Three: "Thinking if." Four: "You're alone too." The melody is a

link between one lonely person and another, and the melodic line is an arch,

moving, unusually, to a climactic high note in the third eight-bar unit (the

bridge) and then, equally unusually, retracing its steps. The final phrase,

instead of repeating the first, turns it upside down and backward, so that one

loneliness balances out the other. Each phrase of the song introduces an

element--a prop, an emotion, a person--that was not there before, so that by

the end we feel we've traveled quite some distance in space and feeling. Is the

song sad or happy? It starts with a sob and ends with a smile; there's a novel

in that. <p>



<font size=5>F</font>OR many critics, "Cheek to Cheek" is not only Berlin's masterpiece--as

memorable "as `Wagner's Wedding March,'" Wilder says--but also No. 1 in the

genre associated with Fred Astaire, which also includes Kern's "I Won't Dance"

and Gershwin's "They Can't Take That Away From Me."Some competition! It shows,

too, how far Berlin had come from "Sadie Salome." The song swings and sizzles

because it is a series of expanding gasps of pleasure. "Heaven": Berlin set the

word like an unexpected tingle, took its two-note figure up the scale with

growing intensity, and then walked it back down to the intimacy of "cheek to

cheek"--you can feel the brush of skin in the rhythmic bounce of that tag. The

phrases of the chorus are twice as long as usual, and so Berlin wrote two

different bridges, the first dippy ("Oh I love to climb a mountain . . ."), the

second impetuous ("Dance with me"). The song is so expansive that the return of

the opening musical phrase has to feel like a letdown, and most singers and

arrangers take the liberty of expanding it--listen to Sarah Vaughan spin it out

into ecstasy. Despite the giddy sexuality of the song, though, it still has

Berlin's typical faux naivet&eacute; (which you can hear the sassy Vaughan

mocking). The song isn't about the joys of sex, it's about the joy of

dancing--another of Berlin's displacements of emotion into a musical

performance. Music is a prophylactic for Berlin. All his songs seem a little

safer than we want them to be. <p>



Perhaps because of their emotional inhibitions, Berlin's songs, even the sad

ones, feel more like jingles than arias--they are advertisements for

themselves. It's all there in "Alexander's Ragtime Band." The tag: "Come on and

hear," with its teasing hint of blues and syncopation. The buildup: the tag is

repeated so that it hangs on the sixth degree of the scale--not the expected,

more consonant fifth. First surprise: the bugle call. The setup: repeat of the

opening phrase but with the words changed--"Let me take you by the hand." The

payoff: "the Swanee River played in ragtime"--not only the high note but a

coronation. Berlin takes the laurel crown from Stephen Foster, and we realize

that Berlin is Alexander, the leader of the band. It's a song about nothing but

its own unstoppable ambition--the immigrant dream in excelsis. <p>

	<font size=5>D</font>UKE ELLINGTON and I faced each other alone for the first time in a tent in

Newport, Rhode Island, in 1956. He was waiting go on stage to play at George

Wein's Newport Jazz Festival. It was an appearance that Ellington had his

doubts about, and with good reason; an appearance important to him, and

therefore one for which he had carefully prepared. He had not been drawing

large audiences. The lucrative college dates had been going to the Brubeck

Quartet, Miles Davis, and Erroll Garner. The Basie band was riding high. The

jazz impressario Norman Granz, Duke believed, was ignoring him in favor of

Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald. Even George Wein was not sure enough of

Ellington's drawing power to make him the star attraction.<p>



<p>



Ellington the composer was also in limbo. His best writing was, according to

his ever-present critics, fifteen years behind him, and he was reminded of it

wherever he went. All anybody wanted to hear was "Sophisticated Lady" and "Mood

Indigo." Jazz writers reminisced in print about the old band. They lamented the

loss of Cootie Williams and "Tricky Sam"; of Barney Bigard and Lawrence Brown;

of Ben Webster. They blasted the pyrotechnics of Cat Anderson and the trifles

Ellington called his latest compositions.<p>



<p>



Also, and unfortunately for me since I represented Columbia Records, Ellington

was not feeling kindly toward record companies. His years of hits during the

big-band days were long gone. His last Columbia contract had produced neither

sales nor distinguished albums, and record executives sought only new versions

of the same old tunes. He was anxious to record <I>Night Creature</I>, a work written

and scored for a symphony orchestra and the Ellington band, but the project was

too expensive. No record company wanted Ellington plus a hundred men playing

music "out of his category," which, of course, was jazz.<p>



<p>



But there was reason to hope for better things. Ellington at fifty-seven had

survived the collapse of the rest of the bands by being willing to accept low

prices, by accepting all one-nighters. Staying home did not appeal to him, and

he was writing every day. Johnny Hodges had returned to the sax section, and

Duke, sitting opposite me in that dressing tent, was willing to listen to my

proposal: a three-year contract at regular royalties with a thousand-dollar

advance for each recorded side. That, like all advances, appealed to him. One

record session would meet the band payroll for a week, and there had been too

many weeks recently when Duke had met the payroll of the highest-paid band

anywhere out of money he made as a writer and publisher of his own music. Also,

long experience with the vagaries of record royalty statements had convinced

Ellington to get all he could in front. "But <I>my</I> loot comes from publishing," he

reminded me. "We have to make new things. Don't talk to me 'bout no

'Sophisticated Lady.'"<p>



<p>



I agreed. I shared the opinion of Columbia's Goddard Lieberson that it was a

record company's responsibility to introduce and to preserve new music. My boss

had been financing a distinguished series of music by contemporary American

composers out of the profits of Mitch Miller's hits. These hits could also pay

for the new music of Ellington, who, I happened to believe, was the greatest of

American composers. "What have you got in mind?" I asked.<p>



<p>



I heard the warning tromp of Harry Carney's foot on the platform above us, then

two beats and the opening of Ellington's theme, "Take The 'A' Train," muffled

by the folds of canvas around us. Duke lit a cigarette. "Did you know," he

asked me, "that a drum is a woman?"<p>



<p>



"'A' Train" was building. I knew Duke would walk across the stage only at the

final, extended chord, precisely late as always. I knew that if I did not have

his agreement before that chord, I might not see him alone again for weeks. "Is

that the first album?" I asked. I was not going to take his bait.<p>



<p>



He laughed. His laugh was an explosive crack, nasal and slightly suggestive,

followed by a swallowed afterlaugh. "Man, that's not only the first album,

that's the mother of all albums. That's the story of Madam Zajj."<p>



<p>



The band blew on. "'A' Train" was entering its endless ending. Ellington stood

up. "Madam Zajj," he stretched the words. "She was always a lady, you know, but

she was also a drum."<p>



<p>



"Do we have a deal?" I asked as he turned toward the stage.<p>



<p>



"Record companies don't like me," Duke warned. "Are you sure you won't get

fired?"<p>



<p>



I assured him I wouldn't.<p>



<p>



"See you in New York next week," he called, disappearing through the tent

flap.<p>



<p>



I remained in the tent, listening to the soft purr of Ellington's traditional

greeting to his audience, the credit to Billy Strayhorn as the composer of "'A'

Train," the assurance that he loved them all madly, the modesty joke as he

called upon "the piano player" for the next number, "Satin Doll." I had no

doubts about the success of my deal with Duke. Nor did I have a suspicion that

both his life and mine were about to change dramatically. Before Ellington left

Newport he was to introduce a new suite, written and named for the festival,

including a section in which tenor saxophonist Paul Gonsalves was to play one

hundred and twenty-eight choruses that would cause a near riot in the audience

and would give Duke his first best-selling album. And I did not realize that

Duke was about to begin a decade in which he would write more new and more

widely acclaimed music than he had in years, would win a worldwide audience and

receive more honors than had ever before been bestowed upon an American

composer. I did not realize either that I was to be a part of that decade of

Ellington.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE recording and editing of Ellington's <I>A Drum Is A Woman</I> took up most of

three months, a period which established my relationship with Duke and made

possible a fairly intimate knowledge of this fascinating and complex man. I

learned about Ellington in a trial by fire, in night after night of working

until dawn; and although we were to be associated in many other projects, and

to be friends ever after, those first months were never surpassed for

concentrated study of the paradoxes that made up Duke Ellington.<p>



<p>



I learned quickly that Ellington had a passion for privacy. I soon understood

that he revealed small parts of himself to many different people, thereby

satisfying his need to be close to what he called his family, while at the same

time denying a complete and too revealing portrait of the whole man to any one

person. It would take a convention of Ellington friends and relatives, pooling

their knowledge of him, to put Ellington together, and even then, like a jigsaw

puzzle with missing pieces, he would emerge with patches of empty space in

crucial places.<p>



<p>



And it did not take long to understand his pride. He did not underestimate

himself and realized, of course, that nobody else did either. He could relish

the turning of understatement into Ellingtonian exaggeration when he referred

to himself as "the piano player." He alternated between the royal "we," the

modest "we," and the plural "we" with ease, and often in the same sentence. He

was fond of cliche, but only his own, and even the dialects of his conversation

were polished.<p>



<p>



<I>A Drum Is A Woman</I> is one of Ellington's most complicated fantasies. It is also

one of his most self-revealing works. It is an allegory paralleling the history

of jazz, as he described it, in which an elaborately fabricated drum is turned

into a very sophisticated lady who travels from Africa to the Caribbean to New

Orleans to New York City and finally to the moon, meeting in each place a

simple man always named Joe, and touching him with her spell before leaving him

for the next Joe. The idea was first suggested by Duke to Orson Welles in 1941,

set aside, but never forgotten. One explanation of Ellington's prolific output

is that he never abandoned an idea just because nobody reacted favorably to it.

Only time kept all his dreams from being realized, and there was never enough

of that. He used to tell me about a ballet idea he had involving an

ex-beautician from Harlem who became the queen of a West Indian island. She

dazzled her subjects by changing the color of the ocean around them as often as

she had once changed the colors of her customers' hair. The story had every

Ellington element in it.<p>



<p>



To understand and to work with Ellington, it was essential to understand the

members of his band, who were, like all who were close to Duke, extensions of

himself. Each to Ellington was a sound in the mosaic of his music. Each, in an

odd way, personified a part of the total Ellington personality. The longer I

knew Duke, the more convinced I became that he needed many bodies, many

separated minds and fingers, to reveal himself. This multibodied personality

was most apparent in the Ellington-Strayhorn unity. Billy Strayhorn,

Ellington's only co-writer, was a classically educated musician, small in

stature, quiet in his ways, shunning the spotlight and the grand manner. He was

both antithesis and metaphor to Ellington. He knew Ellington's mind so well

that he could and often did compose sections of the same suite, sections

indistinguishable from Ellington's contributions. Yet I was intrigued by the

musical difference between them. To me, Strayhorn expressed the feminine side

of Ellington. There is a delicately blended mixture of male and female in all

of us, and in the music they created together Ellington and Strayhorn completed

this balance.<p>



<p>



Duke Ellington's beginning our association with his story of jazz was

surprising to me. Ellington by the mid-fifties had been winning jazz polls for

years, had been so firmly categorized by critics and the businessmen of music

that the very word jazz angered him. As Whitney Balliett has observed,

Ellington's music was "based squarely on the rhythms and harmonies and

structures of jazz." and certainly Duke was proud that he and jazz had had

similar origins, just as he was always most comfortable in music when his band

settled down to a cooking beat and the shared excitement of improvisation. I do

not believe he fought jazz as music, or as a musical cage in which he felt

himself to be trapped. The music represented qualities of freedom, of humor,

and of invention exemplified in his own work. He often left jazz behind, just

as he left Harlem for the cities of the world, but he was never ashamed to be

home again.<p>



<p>



Ellington fought the word jazz because it had come to represent an economic

ghetto for musical minorities, and Ellington had had his share of

discrimination. When his band played Las Vegas in the fifties, they were not

allowed to enter the casino whose stage they graced. When they played Miami

Beach, they could not stay in the hotel that hired them. In music all

categories are restrictive, but for much of Ellington's career jazz was

surrounded by economic and even social walls. He used to introduce his trumpet

player, Clark Terry as "a musician beyond category." Each time he said the

words he was silently including himself.<p>



<p>



<I>A Drum Is A Woman</I> is Ellington's "parallel" of jazz, written, composed,

narrated, and performed by a man who saw himself as the one "Joe" that Madam

Zajj could not leave behind. To the end of his life he thought of <I>Drum</I> as one

of his supreme achievements.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>E</font>LLINGTON got his first break as a bandleader at the Cotton Club audition. He

arrived late by mistake. But the boss who was to hire a band that day also

arrived late; too late, in fact, to hear Ellington's competitor for the job.

Duke's band was hired, and Duke was never late accidentally again. Afterwards

he timed his lateness, and turned it into a performance as polished and

climactic as his music.<p>



<p>



At the first recording session for <I>A Drum Is A Woman</I>, I was introduced to this

Ellington style. As the hour for the recording approached, one man, Harry

Carney, was in his chair in the sax section. Carney's place in the Ellington

hierarchy was second to none, but Harry just could not be late. During the next

hour Russell Procope, another veteran with a penchant for promptness, arrived

to sit beside Carney. John Sanders, the conscientious librarian for the band,

passed out new music, and Sam Woodyard wandered idly through the studio looking

for his drums.<p>



<p>



During the first two hours of the allotted three-hour session, while the

engineer and I sat in the control room wondering if we would ever begin, the

band arrived one at a time. The last sideman to sit down was Johnny Hodges, the

highest-paid member of the band. The group, now in place, began to complain

loudly about wasting all night just sitting around. At that moment Ellington

walked into the room, stopping to kiss his female visitors, chatting with

everybody as he worked his way slowly toward the piano. Then, with a bow toward

the control room, he asked, "Am I late? Oh, dear. What time is it anyway?" He

never wore a watch.<p>



<p>



Ellington's formula for avoiding anger was as carefully considered and

studiously followed as his pattern for lateness. He told me once how to avoid

the corrosive effects of dispute. "Never talk to anybody on the telephone

unless you're lying flat on your back in the bed." Over the years I often

witnessed strong provocation for Ellington outrage, but rarely did I see him

angry. There was the time, for instance, when a member of the band quit and

took the entire first-trumpet book with him, a loss that would have put the

average band out of business and sent its leader off to a rest home. Duke

simply faked it until a new book could be prepared.<p>



<p>



While we were recording a new version of his "Happy-Go-Lucky Local" in a

Hollywood studio, he mentioned that the piece had been stolen, re-titled, and

turned into a well-known hit by another musician. "You can sue for every cent

of royalties," I reminded him. He turned to me and said, "We must be flattered

and just go write something better."<p>



<p>



But anger could flare up in Ellington. When, on rare occasions, a band member

arrived for an Ellington date later than he did, Duke was furious. We were in

his suite at the Warwick Hotel in New York City one afternoon when his

publicist, Joe Morgen, arrived with a copy of one of the now defunct picture

magazines in which there was a feature article by a reporter who had discovered

that Duke's legal wife, from whom he had long been separated, was living in

Washington, D.C. Ellington took one look at the caption and the photographs,

then stared silently at the traffic on Sixth Avenue. This was a penetration of

his privacy. I have never seen him so angry.<p>



<p>



Ellington heard the advice of many, listened to the advice of few, took almost

nobody's. Before his appearance at one of the Monterey Jazz Festivals, West

Coast counterpart of the Newport Jazz Festival, Jimmy Lyons, who coordinated

the nightly programs, entered the Ellington bus to discuss Duke's part of the

nightly program. Lyons had one favor to ask: that Duke not include his now

famous <I>Newport Festival Suite</I> in the Monterey program. Any reference to

Newport, Lyons felt, was unnecessary on his competitive stage. Ellington

listened, made no comment while he continued to choose his wardrobe from his

traveling closet. No sooner had the last sounds of "'A' Train" faded into the

gathering fog, however, than Duke announced as his opening number a section of

the <I>Newport Suite</I>. Whether it was petulance, or good programming, or just

Ellington, the message to Monterey's master of ceremonies was clear.<p>



<p>



Duke used strange methods for disciplining his band of unruly stars. I never

heard him fire anybody. He tolerated the intolerable from his musicians, both

because he respected their right to exercise their idiosyncrasies as he did,

and because confrontation was bad for his digestion. He reserved his anger for

those outside his circle, and that anger, while durable, was seldom explosive.

It arose always from what he considered to be unjust treatment of himself and

those he was fond of, and the subjects of his rages were always out of sight.

His way of punishing a band member for an infraction of his almost nonexistent

regulations, or for any deviation from the normal casual behavior, was

typically oblique. He would call upon the culprit to stand for endless solos (I

have watched Duke keep Paul Gonsalves or Hodges or Cootie thus in front of the

band), calling out every number that featured him, meanwhile lavishing high

praise upon him, encouraging calls of "Encore!" from the audience over the

breathless protests of the victim. It was punishment indeed.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><BR>



<p>



<font size=5>D</font>URING one of the long nights of editing <I>Drum</I>, a subject came up in our

conversation that revealed a side of Ellington I had never known before.

"You're a lucky man," he said, "because you have a family." That was also the

night Duke told me he included me in his family, a flattering announcement that

took me a long while to understand.<p>



<p>



Duke Ellington was seldom alone except in bed, and not always there. Yet he was

the most solitary and secretive man I ever knew. His prescription for privacy

was as elaborate as every other precept for his peace of mind. He surrounded

himself with what he referred to as circles of family. One of the innermost

circles was made up of his son, Mercer, his sister, Ruth, and their families,

who were his only relatives. Close friends, such as Billy Strayhorn and Arthur

Logan, Duke's doctor, formed another inner circle, as did members of his band

and their wives. As the series of concentric circles widened, they included

Ellington's oldest friends around the world, fans, other musicians, mistresses

and old girl friends, a few business associates: all very special people to

Duke. But he not only carefully separated these circles from one another, he

separated the segments of each circle, so that each of us who was included

somewhere in his revolving family shared with him an exclusive part of his

life. Rarely were even his closest friends gathered with him at the same time.

Seldom have I seen his relatives together in one room.<p>



<p>



An example of Duke's separated relationships was his strange treatment of a

woman who undoubtedly saw more of him than any other in the last half of his

life. He called her Evie, and often introduced her in my presence as Mrs.

Ellington. She shared his only permanent address, a West Side apartment in New

York City, and while never married to him, Evie performed many of the duties of

a wife even though she was never seen with Ellington in public.<p>



<p>



And Evie, a dark-haired, handsome woman, a former dancer with a dancer's long

legs and grace of movement, not only remained in an almost impenetrable

background, but was completely separated from the rest of Duke's family. When

he was in New York, she drove him to his appointments in the black Cadillac he

had given her, her prized possession. She joined us for late-night "breakfasts"

in the Hickory House on Fifty-second Street, sitting quietly beside Ellington,

seldom joining the conversation. Most of the time Evie lived alone, because

most of the time Ellington lived in hotel rooms around the world. But I saw

Evie often during these lonely periods, and came to understand both how much

she loved him and how painfully insecure she felt her position in his life to

be.<p>



<p>



Then there was Arthur Logan, a distinguished Harlem surgeon and civic leader,

who was much more than a doctor to Duke. He never missed a recording session

and would sit with his attractive wife, Marion, on the sidelines until all

hours of the night, somehow managing to appear in his clinic at eight every

morning. Arthur was the doctor for the entire Ellington band, and included me

among his patients, but it was to Duke that he gave his time and his devotion.

Ellington, who appeared to many to lead a life which defied all the rules for

good health, was in fact scrupulously cautious about taking care of himself. He

traveled with an overnight bag filled with various pills and medications;

usually spent half of each day in bed, although it was always the half when

everybody else was up; and called Arthur Logan from every city to ask, "How do

I feel?" Logan could usually reassure him, for, as Arthur often told me, Duke

was a medical marvel, with the physique of a man half his age.<p>



<p>



The sudden death of Arthur Logan in a fall from a bridge over New York's West

Side Highway in 1973 was one of the greatest losses Ellington had to sustain.

To the end of his life he had the best medical care the doctors of the world

could offer, but Arthur Logan was an indispensable segment of one of Duke's

closest family circles.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>E</font>LLINGTON'S relationship to his band was a carefully orchestrated affair. He

spent at least three or four hours a day on the bandstand, and the rest of each

day in the same city with his fifteen or more traveling companions. But he

never stayed in the same hotel with them for Ellington at ease was Ellington

once removed. The band members could always find him. On the other hand, there

were occasions when he could not find the band.<p>



<p>



Among band members Harry Carney was closest to Duke, not only because he had

been with the band longer than anyone else, but because it was Harry who drove

Duke from city to city, who sat beside him in Carney's big Chrysler during

those special hours of Ellington's day, the hours between two A.M. and dawn,

when Duke did his most creative thinking. Carney, whose baritone saxophone was

the foundation of the Ellington band, served as a rocklike presence for

Ellington on the road. Duke, who would not fly until finally he had to, who

would not ride in the band bus where he would be vulnerable to every complaint,

sat beside Carney through the night, watching the road map, confident of

Carney's driving and of his silent friendship.<p>



<p>



Duke's family was also separated geographically. There was no large city, no

small town in the country where an old friend or an old girl or both did not

wait for the next one-night visit. These friendships too were for life, but

they suited Ellington best because they were renewed, enjoyed, and suspended

again, usually within a twenty-four-hour period. The secret of Duke's security

was constant movement. He never owned a house. A thousand hotel rooms, a

thousand room-service waiters ready to push his breakfast table in on cue, a

thousand loyal friends waiting to handle any local problems he might have:

these made up the Ellington menage. Except for daily calls to Billy Strayhorn

or to Arthur Logan or to his sister, Ellington was out of town to most of his

friends and family.<p>



<p>



Still, I believe Duke Ellington was the most sentimental family man I have

known. He kept in touch with all of us and never lost one of us. Each came to

understand, as months and even years divided our reunions, that our place in

his family was secure. We also knew that every now and then the phone would

ring between six P.M. and six A.M. A dark, sleepy voice would say, "Good

morning. Did I wake you? I'm so sorry. What time is it anyway? What's

happening?"<p>



Duke was back. Our day with him began.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>A</font> few months before Duke's sixtieth birthday, Arthur Logan called me to a

meeting with himself and Billy Strayhorn. Arthur felt that something special

should be done for the occasion. Ellington birthdays were always reasons for

celebration, and always the celebration was encouraged by Duke himself, who

sent out birthday cards to hundreds of friends. It was one more Ellington

paradox that while he refused to recognize his own mortality, he loved

birthdays. Arthur had an idea for this special birthday, and he needed our

help.<p>



<p>



Logan was horrified by the state of Ellington's music files. Much that Duke had

written, even as recently as <I>A Drum Is A Woman</I>, was either lost or had never

been properly written down. It was Arthur's idea that the three of us should

spend the months before April 29, Duke's birth date, gathering up everything

ever written by him, making clean copies of it, and presenting to Ellington a

complete set of Ellington in bound volumes.<p>



<p>



It sounded like a fine idea. We considered it not only a unique gift for a man

who owned only his music and his wardrobe, but also a valuable contribution to

future Ellington archives. But, as Billy pointed out, a lot of the original

manuscripts had been lost. They would have to be taken down from records still

in the hands of collectors. Also, much of the music Duke had written over the

years never did have lead sheets, single-note copies of his melodies. All the

scraps and bits and remembered themes must be taken down again. It was a

prodigious job.<p>



<p>



We hired John Sanders, trombonist and copyist for the band, later to become the

only Ellington alumnus to enter the priesthood, and certainly one of the

best-equipped members of that body to deal with the frailties of his fellow

man. We swore Sanders to secrecy, set to work gathering the product of more

than thirty years, and patted ourselves on the back.<p>



<p>



The final stack of leather-bound volumes was impressive. I could not be present

on the night in Logan's apartment when the presentation was to be made by

Arthur and Billy, so I waited anxiously for Arthur's call the following day.<p>



<p>



"He was impressed," Logan told me on the phone. "He made polite noises and

kissed us all," he continued, his words coming more slowly, "but, you know, the

son of a bitch didn't even bother to take it home."<p>



<p>



So much for Duke Ellington's interest in his yesterdays.<p>



<p>



The agenda of complexities of this twentieth-century genius is long and

frustrating to any student of Ellington, particularly because Duke seemed such

a public man and was in fact such a private one. Suave, well-mannered,

literate, elegant, all these he was. Secretive, vain, suspicious, superstitious

he was also. Perhaps the right word to describe my relationship with him is

"parallel." a word Ellington liked to describe his own relationship with the

world he moved through. And he and his friends moved together, never quite

touching, never far apart.<p>

a world in which the Persian Gulf controlled two thirds of the world's oil 
for export, with $200 billion a year in oil revenues streaming into that 
unstable and politically troubled region, and America was importing nearly 
60 percent of its oil, resulting in a $100-billion-a-year outflow that 
undermined efforts to reduce our trade deficit. That's a scenario out of 
the 1970s which can never happen again, right? No, that's the "reference 
case" projection for ten years from now from the federal Energy 
Information Administration.<P>

Imagine another world in which <A 
HREF="http://www.fe.doe.gov/">fossil-fuel</A> use had begun a slow, steady 
decline; more than a third of the market for new electricity generation 
was supplied from renewable sources; the renewables industry had annual 
sales of $150 billion; and the fastest-growing new source of power was 
solar energy. An environmentalist's fantasy, right? No, that's one of two 
<A HREF="http://www.ganesa.com/ecotopia/HubShell"">planning scenarios for 
three to four decades from now, developed by Royal 
Dutch/Shell Group,</A> the world's most profitable oil company, which is 
widely viewed as a bench mark for strategic planning. <P>
A decade's worth of little-heralded technological advances funded by the 
<A HREF="http://www.doe.gov">Department of Energy</A> have helped to bring 
such a 
renewables revolution 
within our grasp. Yet budget cuts already proposed by Congress would 
ensure that when renewable energy becomes a source of hundreds of 
thousands--if not millions--of new high-wage jobs in the next 
century, America will have lost its leadership in the relevant 
technologies and will once again be importing products originally 
developed by U.S. scientists. Moreover, Congress's present and planned 
cuts in advanced transportation and fossil-fuel research and development 
impede efforts to maximize the nation's conventional-energy resource 
base.<P>
Although little can be done to change the first scenario, Congress's 
actions all but guarantee that if an oil crisis comes, our national 
response will be reactive, uninformed, and unduly burdensome. Having 
abandoned the technological means to minimize the crisis, the nation will 
be left in the next century with little more than its usual responses to 
energy crises: price controls or other rigid regulations, or unplanned, 
ineffective attempts to deal with the effects of sharp price or supply 
fluctuations. <P>
What's more, cuts in research on clean-energy technologies represent a 
statement by Congress--conscious on the part of some members, 
unintentional on the part of others--that global climate change is of 
little or no concern, and that domestic environmental problems, such as 
urban air quality and industrial waste, require nothing more than existing 
strategies. Yet the nation's "tools" for dealing with pollution are 
similar to those for dealing with an oil crisis, and new technology 
usually provides the most cost-effective solution. One example: A 
relatively small amount of money spent today to develop, test, and deploy 
highly reflective roofing and road material and plant shade trees could 
help cool the Los Angeles area by five degrees, reducing annual 
air-conditioning bills by more than $150 million. Since smog formation is 
very temperature-sensitive, such cooling would reduce smog concentrations 
by 10 percent, which would be comparable to removing three quarters of the 
cars on the road. The health-related benefits of that smog reduction would 
be worth $300 million a year. Applied nationally, the energy savings alone 
could exceed $10 billion a year by 2015.<P>
Although news coverage of the environment has focused on congressional 
efforts to roll back environmental regulations, cuts in 
environmental-technology programs will have as significant an impact on 
our quality of life in the long run. And by turning a blind eye to the 
technological solutions to environmental problems, we limit ourselves to 
far-more-onerous alternatives. The environmental regulations that Congress 
is rolling back today may become all the more necessary in the not too 
distant future.<P>
The programs being cut are not those failures of the past that are often 
mentioned by critics of federal energy research--for example, the 
synfuels program of a decade and a half ago. They are instead programs 
that have been delivering results for years. <A 
HREF="http://www.doe.gov/html/doe/whatsnew/yergin/ytfcont.html">A report 
released last June</A> 
by a blue-ribbon panel of independent energy analysts, led by the energy 
expert Daniel Yergin, the Pulitzer-winning author of <I><A 
HREF="http://www.gbn.org/BookClub/Prize.html">The Prize</A></I>, 
cited dozens of federally funded technological advances that "are 
generating billions of dollars worth of annual consumer energy savings and 
new business opportunities, and playing an important role in job 
creation." This is what will be lost.<P>
Government and the people it represents cannot expect that the best-case 
scenario will play out. Rather, government should in behalf of the people 
try to prevent plausible worst-case scenarios or take advantage of likely 
trends and opportunities through long-term investments that the private 
sector will not make (either because they are too risky or because the 
reward is too far off). Both of us work for the Department of Energy, and 
in this article we examine some likely scenarios concerning petroleum, 
power generation, and pollution to help focus attention on a quiet 
revolution in energy markets and energy technologies which will have a 
profound impact on U.S. economic strength, environmental health, and 
national security in the next century. The impact will probably equal that 
of the much-ballyhooed information revolution, which receives far more 
attention from policymakers and the media. Yet if we don't focus on energy 
today, our quality of life tomorrow will be permanently diminished.<P><br>
<CENTER><b>The Coming Oil Crisis</b><P>
</CENTER> <font size=5>G</font>iven that the most recent war America 
fought was in the Persian 
Gulf, let's start by examining the likelihood that an oil crisis will 
occur in the coming decade. Forecasting is always risky, especially where 
oil is concerned, but consider what a variety of experienced energy hands 
from every point on the political spectrum have said in the past year 
alone. Donald Hodel, who was a Secretary of Energy under Ronald Reagan, 
has said that we are "sleepwalking into a disaster," and predicts a major 
oil crisis within a few years. <A 
HREF="http://www.on-the-net.com/interskills/minis/energy.htm#futu">Irwin 
Stelzer, of the American Enterprise 
Institute, says that the next oil shock "will make those of the 1970s seem 
trivial by comparison."</A> Daniel Yergin says, "People seem to have 
forgotten that oil prices, like those of all commodities, are cyclical and will go 
up again." James Schlesinger, who was the Secretary of Energy under Jimmy 
Carter, has said, "By the end of this decade we are likely to see 
substantial price increases." In March of last year Robert Dole, the 
Senate majority leader, said in a speech at the <A 
HREF="http://www.chapman.edu/nixon/center/index.html">Nixon Center for 
Peace and 
Freedom,</A> "The second inescapable reality of the post-twentieth-century 
world is that the security of the world's oil and gas supplies will remain 
a vital national interest of the United States and of the other industrial 
powers. The Persian Gulf . . . is still a region of many uncertainties. . 
. . In this 'new energy order' many of the most important geopolitical 
decisions--ones on which a nation's sovereignty can depend--will 
deal with the location and routes for oil and gas pipelines. In response, 
our strategy, our diplomacy, and our forward military presence need 
readjusting." The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, not 
known for being an alarmist, in testimony before Congress last July raised 
concerns that a rising trade deficit in oil "tends to create questions 
about the security of our oil resources."<P>
Concerns about a coming oil crisis have surfaced in the financial markets 
as well. Last October, in an article titled <A 
HREF="http://pathfinder.com/@@aPplf5JaLwAAQJej/fortune/magazine/1995/951030/investing.oilplay.html">"Your 

Last Big Play in Oil,"</A> 
<I>Fortune</I> magazine listed several billionaires and "big mutual fund 
managers" who were betting heavily that oil prices would rise 
significantly. The magazine went on to suggest an investment portfolio of 
"companies that are best positioned to profit from the coming boom."<P>
Fundamental trends in oil demand and supply underlie this emerging 
consensus. First, the world will probably need another 20 million barrels 
of oil a day by the year 2010, according to the <A 
HREF="http://www.eia.doe.gov/">Energy Information 
Administration (EIA).</A>The <A 
HREF="http://193.133.97.7/re/paris.htm">International Energy Agency</A> 
projects an even 
greater growth in demand, following the inexorable tide of population 
growth, urbanization, and industrialization.<P>
Second, the world's population is expected to increase by 50 percent by 
2020, with more than half those additional people born in Asia and Latin 
America. And as farm workers move to the city, much more energy and oil 
will be needed. The fundamentals of urbanization--commuting, 
transporting raw materials, constructing infrastructure, powering 
commercial buildings--all consume large amounts of oil and 
electricity. At the same time, fewer farms will have to feed more people, 
and so the use of mechanization, transportation, and fertilizer will 
increase, entailing the consumption of still more energy and oil. An 
analysis by one of the Department of Energy's national laboratories found 
that a doubling of the proportion of China's and India's populations that 
lives in cities could increase per capita energy consumption by 45 
percent--even if industrialization and income per capita remained 
unchanged. <P>
Finally, industrialization has an even greater impact on energy use. As 
countries develop industries, they use more energy per unit of gross 
national product and per worker. Crucial industries for development are 
also the most energy-intensive: primary metals; stone, clay, and glass; 
pulp and paper; petroleum refining; and chemicals. In the United States 
these industries account for more than 80 percent of manufacturing energy 
consumption (and more than 80 percent of industrial waste).<P>
As <I>Fortune</I> has noted, if the per capita energy consumption of China 
and India rises to that of South Korea, and the Chinese and Indian 
populations increase at currently projected rates, "these two countries 
alone will need a total of 119 million barrels of oil a day. That's almost 
double the world's entire demand today."<P>
Barring a major and long-lasting worldwide economic depression, global 
energy demand will be rising inexorably for the foreseeable future. The 
Persian Gulf, with two thirds of the world's oil reserves, is expected to 
supply the vast majority of that increased demand--as much as 80 
percent, <A 
HREF="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo95/oil.html#oil02">according to the 
EIA</A>. Within ten to fifteen years the Persian 
Gulf's share of the world export market may surpass its highest level to 
date, 67 percent, which was attained in 1974. The EIA predicts that in the 
face of increased demand, oil prices will rise slowly to <A 
HREF="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo95/trends.html#trend02">$24 a 
barrel</A> 
(1994 dollars) in 2010. If, instead, they remain low, the Gulf's share of 
the world export market may rise as high as 75 percent in 2010.<P>
Although non-OPEC nations did increase production by almost 15 percent 
from 1980 to 1990, they increased proven reserves of oil by only 10 
percent. The net result is that the remaining years of production for 
non-OPEC reserves has actually fallen from eighteen years to seventeen 
years. On the other hand, while OPEC increased production by 20 percent in 
the 1980s, it increased its proven reserves by 75 percent. As a result, 
OPEC's reserves-to-production ratio doubled to ninety years.<P>
The growing dependence on imported oil in general and Persian Gulf oil in 
particular has several potentially serious implications for the nation's 
economic and national security. First, the United States is expected to be 
importing nearly 60 percent of its oil by ten years from now, with roughly 
a third of that oil coming from the Persian Gulf. Our trade deficit in oil 
is expected to double, to $100 billion a year, by that time--a large 
and continual drag on our economic health. To the extent that the Gulf's 
recapture of the dominant share of the global oil market will make price 
increases more likely, the U.S. economy is at risk. Although oil imports 
as a percent of gross domestic product have decreased significantly in the 
past decade, our economic vulnerability to rapid increases in the price of 
oil persists. Since 1970 sharp increases in the price of oil have always 
been followed by economic recessions in the United States.<P>
Second, the Persian Gulf nations' oil revenues are likely to almost 
triple, from $90 billion a year today to $250 billion a year in 
2010--a huge geopolitical power shift of great concern, especially 
since some analysts predict increasing internal and regional pressure on 
Saudi Arabia to alter its pro-Western stance. This represents a $1.5 
trillion increase in wealth for Persian Gulf producers over the next 
decade and a half. That money could buy a tremendous amount of weaponry, 
influence, and mischief in a chronically unstable region. And the breakup 
of the Soviet Union, coupled with Russia's difficulty in earning hard 
currency, means that for the next decade and beyond, pressure will build 
to make Russia's most advanced military hardware and technical expertise 
available to well-heeled buyers. <P>
The final piece in the geopolitical puzzle is that during the oil crisis 
of the 1970s the countries competing with us for oil were our NATO allies, 
but during the next oil crisis a new, important complication will arise: 
the competition for oil will increasingly come from the rapidly growing 
countries of Asia. Indeed, in the early 1970s East Asia consumed well 
under half as much oil as the United States, but by the time of the next 
crisis East Asian nations will probably be consuming more oil than we do. 
<P><br>
<CENTER><b>Abandoning the Solution</b><P>
</CENTER><font size=5>W</font>hat is the appropriate national response to 
the re-emerging 
energy-security threat? Abroad the Department of Energy has been working 
hard to expand sources of oil outside the Persian Gulf region--in the 
former Soviet Union, for example--and to encourage the privatization 
of the oil companies in Mexico and other Latin American countries.<P>
At home the DOE is encouraging greater production by providing royalty 
relief in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and similar incentives, so 
that the industry can drill wells that otherwise would not be 
cost-effective. The DOE is working to reduce the cost for the industry to 
comply with federal regulations. Finally, the department is spending tens 
of millions of dollars a year to develop new technologies that will lower 
the cost of finding and extracting oil--for example, using advanced 
computing to model oil fields. Still, few expect to reverse the 
decade-long decline in U.S. oil production. Some would open the <A 
HREF="http://bluegoose.arw.r9.fws.gov/nwrsfiles/RefugeSystemLeaflets/R7/Arctic/ArcticIndex.html">Arctic 


National Wildlife Refuge</A> to drilling, a plan the Clinton 
Administration 
has opposed on environmental grounds, but not even that would change our 
forecasted oil dependency much. This is true even using earlier, more 
optimistic estimates that the refuge could provide 300,000 barrels of oil 
a day for thirty years. The EIA projects that within ten to fifteen years 
the United States will probably be importing <I>thirty times as 
much</I>--some 10 million barrels of crude oil a day, even if the 
decline in other domestic production levels off in the next few years.<P>
Increasing domestic supply, although it may help to slow the rising tide 
of imports, cannot itself reverse the major trend. And reversing the 
nation's ever-increasing demand for oil would be difficult. The country is 
in no mood to enact higher energy taxes in order to bring our energy 
markets into better balance. To most people, an increase in gasoline taxes 
of even a few cents a gallon--let alone the amount needed to have a 
noticeable impact on consumption--is anathema. Similarly, Congress is 
in no mood for a regulatory approach, such as mandating increased fuel 
efficiency for cars.<P>
That leaves one solution for reducing consumption: the technological 
approach, which draws on America's traditional leadership in research and 
development. Here tremendous progress has been made. Given the uncertain 
nature of long-term, high-risk R&D in leapfrog technologies, the prudent 
approach is to explore a number of possibilities. The DOE has invested in 
the development of cars and trucks that are highly fuel-efficient, along 
with cars that run on electricity, on liquid biofuels from crops, crop 
waste, and municipal solid waste, or on natural gas. <P>
Consider biofuels. In 1994 research sponsored by the DOE created a 
genetically engineered organism that enhances the fermentation of 
cellulose, increasing the rate of conversion and the yield of ethanol. 
This achievement, described in the journal <I><A 
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/">Science</A></I>, was named one 
of the hundred most significant technological advances of the year by 
<I><A 
HREF="http://www.nde.swri.edu/systems/disk_rim/rd100_info.html">R&D</A></I> 

magazine. This and other federally supported research has 
brought the cost of making ethanol from $3.60 a gallon fifteen years ago 
to about $1.00 a gallon today. If biofuels R&D were funded at current 
levels for five to ten years, ethanol from fast-growing dedicated crops, 
crop waste, and wastepaper could be produced for as little as sixty to 
seventy cents a gallon by 2005. In a country with excess cropland, such as 
the United States, the potential for <A 
HREF="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/BFDP/BFDPMOSAIC/binmenu.html">biofuels</A> 
is enormous. Rather than 
paying some farmers not to grow anything, we might in the future pay the 
same farmers to grow dedicated bioenergy crops. In a country where 
cropland is scarce, such as China, bioenergy could come from municipal and 
agricultural wastes. <P>
Technologies are also being developed to make possible a superefficient 
<A HREF="http://www.hev.doe.gov/">hybrid vehicle</A> that has both an 
internal-combustion engine and some kind 
of energy-storage device, such as a battery or a flywheel. A very advanced 
hybrid has been described by Amory B. Lovins and L. Hunter Lovins (see 
<A HREF="wheels.htm">"Reinventing the Wheels,"</A> January, 1995, 
<I>Atlantic</I>). Supporting 
technologies include lightweight, superstrong materials and advanced 
engines, among other things. This research has been undertaken by the 
<A HREF="http://picard.aero.hq.nasa.gov/">Partnership for a New Generation 
of Vehicles,</A> a collaboration among 
several federal agencies, the DOE's national laboratories, and the auto 
industry. The goal of the partnership is to design and construct by 2004 a 
prototype clean car that has three times the fuel efficiency of existing 
cars and very low emissions, and also comparable or improved performance, 
safety, and cost. Such a car would allow domestically produced <A 
HREF="http://www.ev.hawaii.edu/">advanced 
technologies</A> to replace oil imports.<P>
Another direction that research is taking is toward advanced batteries for 
use in electric cars--among them the nickel metal-hydride 
battery--which promise to double the range achievable with existing 
lead-acid batteries. In conjunction with advances in clean power 
generation, described below, these batteries hold the prospect of 
replacing imported oil with domestically produced electricity.<P>
The technology that most experts would agree has the best chance over the 
long term of replacing petroleum use in the transportation sector is <A 
HREF="http://www.engr.uvic.ca/~dbryan/fuelcell.html">fuel 
cells.</A> These are compact modular devices that generate electricity and 
heat with high efficiency and virtually no pollution. They run on hydrogen 
converted from natural gas and other fuels. The National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration developed early versions of fuel cells for use on 
space missions. Over the past two decades the DOE has spent tens of 
millions of dollars on several types of fuel cells that will soon be used 
to power cars, trucks, utilities, commercial buildings, and industries. 
The Japanese government has been increasing its fuel-cell budget by an 
average of 20 percent a year for the past five years, and Japanese 
companies are less than five years behind U.S. companies in this 
technology. The Europeans are considering significantly increasing their 
fuel-cell funding. Sustained federal support might well give America the 
lion's share of a multibillion-dollar global market.<P>
Fuel cells are one of many advances that may increase the use of natural 
gas as a transportation fuel over the long term. Since 1992 the DOE has 
significantly increased its budget for research and development related to 
enhancing the supply and the efficient use of natural gas. It is seeking 
to encourage a wider use of natural-gas vehicles, to establish a 
nationwide infrastructure for fueling those vehicles, and to develop 
gas-turbine engines for light-duty vehicles.<P>
Current DOE programs--unlike those of the late 1970s, which required 
oil to cost $80 a barrel if they were to be competitive--are aimed at 
making alternatives competitive even if oil prices decline. The likely 
outcome of all the programs mentioned above should not be overstated: we 
will not achieve energy independence in the next fifteen years. What this 
investment portfolio does offer is a chance in the years thereafter to 
blunt any foreign threat to raise oil prices dramatically and to limit the 
economic and geopolitical impact of Persian Gulf oil in particular. At the 
same time, domestic jobs will be created if money that might have gone 
overseas to buy foreign oil goes instead to manufacturing superefficient 
cars and trucks or domestic biofuels.<P>
What's more, the rapid population growth and urbanization of developing 
nations, coupled with the harsh pollution that characterizes most major 
urban centers in those nations, ensure a tremendous market for 
low-emission, superefficient automotive technology. Our industrialized 
competitors have one inherent advantage in the race to develop the 
supercar: gas prices of $3.00 or $4.00 a gallon. Fuel efficiency matters 
more in their economies, and vehicles that use alternative fuels will be 
cost-competitive in their markets sooner. The primary counterbalance to 
that advantage is U.S. technological leadership in most relevant areas, 
stemming in part from historically higher levels of R&D spending.<P>
That counterbalance is about to disappear. Congress has cut the proposed 
fiscal year 1996 allocations for the DOE's 
advanced-transportation-technology budget by 30 percent. Moreover, the 
multi-year balanced-budget plan approved by the House and Senate would cut 
the budget for such technology by 60&#173;80 percent in real terms. <P>
The fact that the DOE has been collaborating with the auto industry in the 
Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles gives some in Congress a thin 
excuse to label the partnership's programs "corporate welfare." Yet 
Detroit's car makers agreed to match federal spending while coordinating 
their corporate research with the DOE's national laboratories in order to 
address the pressing national problems of oil imports and urban air 
quality. The last time America ignored the warning signs of growing 
dependence on imported oil, the Japanese were able to seize a significant 
share of the U.S. auto market with fuel-efficient cars. <P>
Congress's own Office of Technology Assessment released a report last 
September acknowledging that the DOE's "strategy of pursuing several 
different [vehicle] technology options is advantageous for a variety of 
reasons." Congress is ignoring the advice of the office it set up, 
staffed, and funded to provide independent advice on technological issues 
of national importance. Indeed, it apparently no longer wants to hear any 
advice on such issues.<A 
HREF="http://www.the-scientist.library.upenn.edu/yr1996/jan/ota_960122.html">Late 
last year Congress closed the Office of 
Technology Assessment for good.</A> <P>
That the nation's and the world's dependence on Persian Gulf oil will grow 
over the next decade seems inevitable. This is particularly true since 
most projections assume continuing significant technological progress in 
bringing down the cost of domestic production, in developing alternatives, 
and in using energy and oil more efficiently. But those projections have 
not factored in the federal government's plans to withdraw from its role 
in fostering the development and deployment of those technologies.<P><br>
<CENTER><b>The Renewables Revolution</b><P>
</CENTER><font size=5>P</font>redicting our energy future beyond 2010 is 
chancy, but here we 
have an opportunity to rely on perhaps the most successful predictor in 
the energy business: Royal Dutch/Shell Group. According to <I><A 
HREF="http://www.economist.com">The 
Economist</A></I>, "The only oil company to anticipate both 1973's 
oil-price 
boom and 1986's bust was Royal Dutch/Shell." Anticipating the oil shocks 
of the 1970s helped Shell to move from being the weakest of the seven 
largest oil companies in 1970 to being one of the two strongest only ten 
years later. Anticipating the oil bust was apparently even more lucrative. 
According to <I><A HREF="http://pathfinder.com/@@l4uqcJJaLwAAQKWj/
fortune/magazine/1995/950807/global500/profits.html">Fortune</I>'s ranking 
of 
the 500 largest corporations,</A> 
Royal Dutch/Shell is now not only the most profitable oil company in the 
world but the most profitable corporation of any kind.<P>
When such a company envisions a fundamental transition in power generation 
from fossil fuels to renewable energy beginning in two decades, a 
transition that will have a significant impact on every aspect of our 
lives, the prediction is worth examining in some detail. Chris Fay, the 
chairman and CEO of Shell UK Ltd., said in a speech in Scotland last year, 
"There is clearly a limit to fossil fuel. . . . Shell analysis suggests 
that resources and supplies are likely to peak around 2030 before 
declining slowly. . . . But what about the growing gap between demand and 
fossil fuel supplies? Some will obviously be filled by hydro-electric and 
nuclear power. Far more important will be the contribution of alternative 
renewable energy supplies." <P>
Fay presented a detailed analysis of future trends in energy supply and 
demand, noting that the fossil-fuel peak in 2030 would occur at a usage 
level half again as high as today's. Shell's analysis does not rely 
exclusively on supply limits--after all, for decades people have been 
worried about such limits, and the supply has continued to expand--but 
also incorporates a recognition of the tremendous advances that have been 
made in renewable-energy technologies over the past two decades and that 
are expected to be made over the next two decades.<P>
Although these advances in renewables have received very little media 
attention, they have persuaded Shell planners that renewables may make up 
a third of the supply of new electricity within three decades <I>even if 
electricity from fossil fuels continues to decline in cost</I>. An "Energy 
in Transition" scenario that they have prepared does not assume price 
increases in fossil fuels--also, as we have seen, a plausible 
hypothesis. Nor does Shell assume any attempt by governments to 
incorporate environmental costs into the price of energy, even though 
every single independent analysis has found that fossil-fuel generation 
has much higher environmental costs than non-fossil-fuel generation has. 
According to Shell's strategic-planning group, "The Energy in Transition 
future can claim to be a genuine 'Business as Usual' scenario, since its 
energy demand is a continuation of a long historical trend, and the energy 
is supplied in a way which continues the pattern."<P>
Indeed, in the past fifteen years the Department of Energy, working with 
the private sector, has reduced the costs of electricity from <A 
HREF="http://www.biomass.org/">biomass</A> 
(such as crops and crop waste) and wind, bringing them into the current 
range of wholesale costs for coal and other traditional sources of 
electricity: three to five cents per kilowatt-hour.<P>
A quiet revolution has already brought the United States almost eight 
gigawatts of biomass electrical capacity. Gasifying biomass and using 
advanced turbines could bring biomass power to 4.5 cents per kilowatt-hour 
within a decade, according to the <A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov">DOE's 
National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory.</A> Shell projects that by 2010 commercial energy from biomass 
could provide five percent of the world's power; using Shell's 
projections, we estimate that the value of that power generation could 
exceed $20 billion.<P>
Over the past fifteen years electricity from <A 
HREF="http://solstice.crest.org/renewables/re-kiosk/wind/index.shtml">wind 
power</A> has declined in 
cost by 10 percent a year. The problems of the windmills that were rushed 
to market in the 1970s, such as noise and TV interference, have largely 
been solved. With the DOE's help the old wind-turbine blades, borrowed 
almost directly from aircraft-propeller design, have been replaced with 
sophisticated blades designed to capture wind energy efficiently over a 
broad range of wind speeds and direction. Utilities are already receiving 
long-term bids for electricity from wind at 4.5 cents per kilowatt-hour in 
the best wind sites in the country. With a continued public-private 
partnership in technology advancement, wind could hit three cents per 
kilowatt-hour by 2020, and soon after that wind-power plants' annual sales 
could reach $50 billion.<P>
<A 
HREF="http://www.history.rochester.edu/class/solar/cells.htm">Photovoltaic 
(PV) cells,</A> which convert sunlight into electricity, now cost 
one tenth what they did in 1975. The DOE has invested heavily in new 
thin-film PV panels, which take advantage of U.S. expertise in 
semiconductor fabrication. Shell expects that PVs, along with fuel cells 
and small gas-fired power plants, will permit the growth of 
distributed-power systems. In developing nations distributed sources can 
obviate the need for huge power lines and other costly elements of an 
enormous electric-power grid (much as personal computers replace large 
mainframe computers). PV modules sold worldwide totaled less than four 
megawatts in 1980 and now exceed 80 megawatts a year; sales continue to 
grow. The Energy in Transition scenario predicts that photovoltaics and 
other direct conversions of sunlight will be the most rapidly growing form 
of commercial energy after 2030. Sales could quickly exceed $100 billion. 
Shell itself has bought two photovoltaics companies.<P>
This scenario, a highly credible one given Shell's reputation, is 
tantalizing, because it holds out the possibility that the world could 
within a few decades begin to realize the dream of nearly pollution-free 
energy. Consider also that the United States, which is now the leader in 
most areas of renewables technology, could simultaneously reduce its 
dependence on foreign energy supplies, reverse the trend toward an 
ever-increasing energy trade deficit, and capture a large share of what 
promises to be perhaps the largest new job-creating sector of the 
international economy.<P>
This is only a scenario; our actions today can have an impact, either 
positive or negative. According to Chris Fay, of Shell, "New technologies 
cannot leap from laboratory to mass market overnight. They must first be 
tested in niche markets, where some succeed but many fail. Costs fall as 
they progress down the 'learning curve' with increasing application." The 
long-term nature of research, and the real potential for failure, are why 
many options must be pursued at once and why many private-sector companies 
have been reluctant to invest. Fay observes, "Renewables will have to 
progress very quickly if they are to supply a major proportion of the 
world's energy in the first half of the next century. . . . They can only 
emerge through the process of widespread commercial experimentation and 
competitive optimization."<P>
Federal investments clearly make a difference in technology development 
and global market share. Consider the case of photovoltaics. In <A 
HREF="http://www.att.com/timeline/tline50b.html">1955 Bell 
Laboratories</A> invented the first practical PV cell. Through the 1960s 
and 
1970s investments and purchases by NASA, the Pentagon, and the <A 
HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/nsf/nsfpubs/guide/intro.htm">National 
Science Foundation</A> helped to sustain the PV industry and gave America 
leadership in world sales. In 1982 federal support for renewable energy 
was cut deeply, and within three years Japan became the world leader in PV 
sales. The Bush Administration began to increase funding for solar energy 
and, in 1990, collaborated with the American PV industry in efforts to 
improve manufacturing technology; three years later the United States 
regained the lead in sales in this rapidly growing industry. The Clinton 
Administration has accelerated funding for PVs.<P>
Sadly, however, the cuts of the 1980s have taken their toll: in the past 
decade German and Japanese companies snapped up several major American PV 
companies, which accounted for 63 percent of the PVs manufactured in the 
United States. Such purchases represent huge savings for our foreign 
competitors. They don't have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to 
determine which technologies succeed. They need only let the United States 
do the basic research, and then spend a few tens of millions of dollars 
plucking the winners when the federal government abandons funding for 
applied research.<P>
Although many members of Congress argue that the cuts in federal R&D will 
be made up for by the private sector, historically this hasn't happened. 
When the government pulls out of an area of technology, it sends a signal 
to the industrial and financial communities that the area has no long-term 
promise and that the federal government is not a reliable partner. The 
situation is especially bad today, because recent studies make clear that 
private-sector R&D has been fairly flat since 1991, and because U.S. 
companies have been shifting away from basic and applied research toward 
incremental product and process improvement--a shift that has been 
exacerbated by increased international competition and the downsizing of 
corporate laboratories.<P>
In addition, whereas the federal government only recently, and 
temporarily, increased funding for renewable energy, reversing the deep 
cuts of the 1980s, our foreign competitors have been steadily increasing 
such funding for a decade and a half. Whereas we once spent several times 
as much as the rest of the world combined, the rest of the world now 
significantly outspends us. Moreover, countries such as Germany, Japan, 
Denmark, and the Netherlands have far greater financial incentives for 
renewable energy. And their prices for electricity are typically much 
higher: in 1991 electricity cost Germany's industrial sector 8.8 cents per 
kilowatt-hour, whereas in the United States it cost 4.9 cents per 
kilowatt-hour. That means renewable energy will be cost-effective in 
foreign countries before it is in America.<P>
The primary competitive advantage the United States has had in renewables 
is technological leadership driven by long-term federal spending prior to 
the early 1980s and then the spending in the early 1990s. Recently 
Congress cut renewable-energy funding by 30 percent, and its multi-year 
budget plan calls for overall cuts of 60 percent or more by the year 2002. 
The cuts will have two effects.<P>
First, the transition to renewables that Shell envisions will probably be 
slowed somewhat, since America remains the leader in many relevant 
renewables technologies and U.S. government funding remains a sizable 
fraction of R&D funding worldwide. The transition, however, even if 
slowed, seems inevitable at some point in the middle of the next century. 
<P>
Second, when the transition occurs, the United States will miss what may 
well be the single largest new source of jobs in the next century. Mature 
areas like automobile manufacturing and aerospace haven't been significant 
net job producers for the country in two decades. The most highly promoted 
new area--the information revolution--is unlikely to provide as 
many jobs as manufacturing can, because making duplicate pieces of 
information generates many fewer new jobs than manufacturing duplicate 
pieces of hardware. Yet according to Shell's numbers, annual sales in 
renewable-energy technologies may hit $50 billion in 2020 and almost $400 
billion in 2040. In the later year such an industry would support several 
million jobs.<P>
Moreover, as said above, the United States will be importing $100 billion 
worth of oil annually ten years from now. With prudent federal investment 
today, that might be the peak, and we might then see a gradual decline as 
U.S. technology and domestic fuels, including homegrown biomass, replace 
imported oil. With Congress's cuts, however, we may be only augmenting our 
debilitating trade deficit in oil with an equally debilitating trade 
deficit in oil-replacing technologies.<P><br>
<CENTER><b>Preventing Pollution</b><P>
</CENTER><font size=5>T</font>he renewables revolution, inevitable or not, 
won't spell the end 
of the nation's or the world's environmental problems. In Shell's scenario 
overall fossil-fuel use will increase steadily for decades, peaking in 
2030 at a level half again as high as today's, and will not dip below 
current levels until 2100. If we are to achieve genuine 
prosperity--higher living standards accompanied by improved 
environmental quality--we will need to do better.<P>
Consider one of the nagging environmental problems around the world: urban 
air quality. Most cities have dark surfaces and less vegetation than their 
surroundings, creating a "heat island" that affects climate, increases 
energy use, and decreases habitability. Buildings' dark roofs and 
inadequate shade in summertime raise the demand for air-conditioning, so 
more power and pollution are generated. Heat islands raise the temperature 
of many cities by as much as five degrees, increasing the production of 
smog, which is typically created in hot weather. Finally, urban heat 
islands exacerbate all heat waves, contributing to summer fatalities.<P>
We know the basics of how to cool a city: Buildings need shade trees, and 
buildings, roads, and parking lots require light-colored surfaces. Cooler 
roads might cost slightly more initially, but they would probably last 
20&#173;50 percent longer because they reduce thermal wear and reduce 
ultraviolet damage. Over a twenty-year period trees could be planted 
cheaply, and roads, roofs, and parking lots could be resurfaced during the 
course of normal maintenance, saving the country billions of dollars a 
year.<P>
Clearly, the mitigation of urban heat islands is an important effort. The 
federal government has a crucial role to play in research and testing to 
help identify and develop the best roofing and paving materials, in 
funding computer models for determining the optimal approach to cooling a 
city, and in disseminating information in the nation and the world.<P>
This energy-saving, pollution-avoiding approach would be part of a much 
broader shift in the nation's environmental policy, which is vital if we 
are to be a prosperous country in the next century. The environmental 
paradigm that has predominated since the 1960s has been based on the 
notion that pollution is an inevitable by-product of business and that 
public- and private-sector efforts should be aimed at cleaning up that 
pollution after the fact or safely disposing of it in land, water, or the 
atmosphere. This so-called end-of-pipe approach is increasingly being 
challenged not only on environmental grounds but also on economic ones. 
Michael Porter, a professor at the Harvard Business School, wrote in the 
<A 
HREF="http://www.hbsp.harvard.edu/Web/hbsshow/hbr/backissue/sepoct95/article7.htm">September-October, 

1995, issue</A> of the <I>Harvard Business Review</I>, 
<P><blockquote>
When scrap, harmful substances, or energy forms are discharged into the 
environment as pollution, it is a sign that resources have been used 
incompletely, inefficiently, or ineffectively. Moreover, companies then 
have to perform additional activities that add cost but create no value 
for customers: for example, handling, storage, and disposal of 
discharges.</blockquote><P>
The traditional end-of-pipe approach involves three kinds of economic 
waste: two identified by Porter (using resource inputs and pollution 
outputs inefficiently) and the societal costs associated with the myriad 
harmful side effects of resource overuse (for example, dependence on 
foreign oil) and of pollution (such as human illness and agricultural 
loss).<P>
Because of the close connection between energy production and consumption 
on the one hand and pollution on the other, the Department of Energy 
provides a substantial majority--70 percent--of all federally 
funded <A 
HREF="http://www.em.doe.gov/poluprev/intro.html">pollution-prevention</A> 
R&D. Pollution-prevention technologies take a 
variety of forms. Renewable energy prevents pollution in the production of 
electricity. Fuel cells offer the hope of preventing pollution in the 
transportation sector. Many other sectors of the economy have equally 
great prevention opportunities.<P>
As Yergin's task force noted, <A 
HREF="http://syssrv9.nrel.gov/documents/eren/success.html">in the past two 
decades a DOE investment 
totaling about $1.1 billion in energy-efficient industrial technologies 
has yielded "approximately $2.5 billion in documented energy savings and 
net productivity gains, and the accumulation of these savings continues to 
grow at increasing rates."</A> By 2000 these investments will be 
generating 
savings of about $10 billion a year. Very few other federal investments 
produce as great a societal return on taxpayers' dollars.<P>
One technology, a process for dezincing (removing the galvanized coating 
from) scrap steel, provided the breakthrough that industry needed in order 
to recycle up to 10 million tons of scrap metal annually. By 2005 
electrochemical dezincing could reduce raw-materials costs by $150 million 
a year, saving 50 trillion BTUs in the process, and reduce the need to 
import at least 70,000 tons of zinc, for further savings of at least $70 
million annually. Another government-funded technology, vacuum-pressure 
swing adsorption, which is now used in manufacturing 15 percent of the 
glass made in the United States, reduces glassmaking emissions of nitrogen 
oxide by 90 percent and cuts furnace energy use by 25 percent.<P>
Something that is not widely understood is that most industrial pollution 
in the United States comes from the country's seven most energy-intensive 
industries: steel, aluminum, petroleum refining, chemicals, pulp and paper 
products, glass, and metal casting. These industries account for about 80 
percent of the energy consumed in U.S. manufacturing and for more than 90 
percent of the hazardous waste. They represent the greatest opportunities 
for increasing energy and resource efficiency while reducing pollution. 
That's why the DOE has been forming partnerships with these industries to 
develop clean technologies.<P>
Funding for pollution prevention is the best way for the nation to avoid 
the need for costly environmental regulations. The government has a role 
in encouraging pollution prevention for several reasons. First, 
pollution-prevention technologies often benefit each of many companies 
only a little bit, so no one company has an incentive to spend the 
necessary money by itself. Second, prevention has many societal benefits: 
it reduces energy and other resource consumption and improves the 
environment, among other advantages. Third, and most important, pollution 
prevention and resource efficiency help companies to shift money from 
consuming energy and resources to investing in technology and capital 
equipment, thus creating jobs and economic growth. Indeed, a shift from 
consumption to investment may be the single most important transformation 
the U.S. economy must undergo if we are to remain prosperous in the next 
century.<P>
A 1993 analysis for the DOE attempted to quantify the macroeconomic 
benefits of <A HREF="http://146.138.5.107/EPIC.EXE?EPIC">pollution 
prevention.</A> The study found that a 10&#173;20 
percent reduction in waste by American industry would generate a 
cumulative increase of $1.94 trillion in the gross domestic product from 
1996 to 2010. By 2010 the improvements would be generating two million new 
jobs, or roughly 1.5 percent of employment in that year. According to the 
study, this is "a relatively large impact considering that the investments 
driving it were assumed to be made for purposes other than increasing 
employment."<P>
Moreover, this analysis does not include the jobs to be gained from 
capturing the large and growing export market for clean technologies and 
processes. Resource inefficiency and environmental degradation are very 
real limitations on the attempts of developing nations to raise the living 
standards of their people, especially since most of those nations do not 
have the abundance of resources with which America is endowed. The World 
Bank estimates that by 2000 the countries of Asia alone will need to spend 
about $40 billion a year on clean technologies. By then the global market 
for environmental services and technologies is expected to exceed $400 
billion. The resource, environmental, and capital constraints on the 
developing world guarantee a rich export market for the nation that leads 
the world in developing clean technologies.<P>
As Michael Porter wrote in the <I>Harvard Business Review</I>, 
<P><blockquote>
We are now in a transitional phase of industrial history in which 
companies are still inexperienced in handling environmental issues 
creatively. . . . The early movers--the companies that can see the 
opportunity first and embrace innovation-based solutions--will reap 
major competitive benefits, just as the German and Japanese car makers did 
[with fuel-efficient cars in the early 1970s]. </blockquote><P>
That's why foreign governments are forming partnerships with their 
nations' companies to develop clean technologies: to overcome inexperience 
and ensure that they reap the benefits of early strength in the field. <P>
The Japanese government is betting heavily on clean technologies and 
renewable energy. It is vigorously pursuing the Asian environmental market 
through the Green Aid Plan, which is designed to help Asian countries 
prevent water and air pollution, recycle waste, conserve energy, and 
develop alternative energy sources. In 1993 Japan quadrupled funding for 
the Green Aid Plan, to $120 million.<P>
Germany, too, is moving in this direction, with regulations that 
increasingly push industry toward prevention, recycling, and life-cycle 
analysis. Proposed or pending regulations throughout Western Europe have 
implications for U.S. companies, as noted in a 1993 report prepared for 
the <A HREF="http://www.saturnmedia.com/96press/mfg/environ.htm">Saturn 
Corporation</A> by the University of Tennessee <A 
HREF="http://www.ra.utk.edu/eerc/clean2.html">Center for Clean 
Products and Clean Technologies:</A> "European auto manufacturers are the 
current world leaders in car recycling and the use of life-cycle 
assessment to design environmentally superior cars." <P>
One of the countries most attentive to prevention is the Netherlands, 
which spends about $500 million a year on environmental 
technologies--equivalent on a per capita basis to $9 billion in the 
United States. More than a third of that money is spent on pollution 
prevention. The Netherlands also uses its tax code to promote clean 
technologies by allowing firms that practice innovative pollution 
prevention to depreciate their investment in one year instead of over ten 
years.<P>
Congress, in contrast, has cut by a third the Department of Energy's 
proposed budget for the development and deployment of energy-efficient and 
pollution-prevention technologies--a step that threatens U.S. 
leadership in this crucial area. Congress has proposed still deeper cuts 
in its multi-year budget plans--cuts that would deny U.S. companies a 
great many opportunities to compete and the nation as a whole the 
opportunity to capture a big piece of a market whose potential is equal to 
that of renewable energy: several hundred billion dollars a year. <P>
Even the vitally important urban-heat-island-mitigation program described 
above has gone unfunded. For the 1995 and 1996 budgets the DOE asked for 
$2 million--a tiny sum by federal-government standards--for a <A 
HREF="http://eande.lbl.gov/EAP/AR/ueei/ueei3.html">Cool 
Communities program,</A> to take the idea beyond the realm of small-scale 
testing. Like many programs that save energy in a cost-effective way, the 
program would also reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, whose increasing 
prevalence in the atmosphere may be changing the earth's climate. The 
department included the Cool Communities program in its <A 
HREF="http://www.eren.doe.gov/partnering/epse/cc_wise.html">Climate 
Change 
Action Plan,</A> to meet the nation's international commitment to try to 
limit 
greenhouse gases.<P>
In both years Congress zeroed out the Cool Communities program. Why? 
Whereas the pre-1994 Congress was skeptical of global climate change, the 
new one is downright hostile to the concept, with some labeling it 
"trendy"and "scientific nonsense." <P>
Yet at a meeting last December of the <A 
HREF="http://www.unep.ch/ipcc/ipcc95.html">Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate 
Change,</A> representatives of 120 governments agreed that "the balance of 
evidence . . . suggests a discernible human influence on global 
climate."In a 1995 study scientists examined detailed records of weather 
over the past hundred years and concluded that weather extremes--heat, 
drought, excessive rain, or the kind of blizzard that the Northeast 
experienced in January--are becoming more common and that the extreme 
weather is almost certainly due to human-generated emissions of greenhouse 
gases.<P>
<I>The Economist </I>concluded last October, "Climate change is a 
legitimate worry. Although still riddled with uncertainties, the science 
of climate change is becoming firmer: put too much carbon in the 
atmosphere and you might end up cooking the earth, with possibly 
catastrophic results." <P><br>
<CENTER><b>Preparing for the Future</b><P>
</CENTER><font size=5>S</font>ome argue that energy forecasts are 
notoriously inaccurate and 
that for the Department of Energy to base decisions on them is risky. We 
cannot, of course, say with certainty that an oil crisis will occur in the 
next decade, that a transition to renewable energy will occur as Shell 
envisions, or that industry worldwide will shift to pollution prevention. 
But each of these things seems very plausible, if not likely.<P>
Another criticism often leveled at the DOE is that it has had big, 
expensive failures, such as the synthetic-fuels program, but few 
successes. The department has learned from experience, however, and its 
R&D portfolio is diverse, emphasizing small-scale technologies that have 
in fact been remarkably successful in the past. The recently concluded 
independent review of the department's energy-research portfolio cited 
dozens of examples of such technologies, among them a $3 million 
investment in energy-efficient windows made in the late 1970s, which has 
already saved U.S. taxpayers more than $1 billion in lower energy bills; a 
polycrystalline diamond drill bit that has reduced the cost of drilling 
for oil by $1 million per well; and many of the advances described above, 
including photovoltaics.<P>
Diversity is a key element of DOE policy today: diversify the world's oil 
supply, and diversify America's domestic supply and end-use options. 
Because no one can predict the future with certainty, or know the outcome 
of R&D in advance, the DOE must invest in many options. The sharp cuts 
that Congress is pursuing narrow the country's options and leave us far 
less flexibility to respond to future crises and opportunities.<P>
Finally, some argue that government investments are "corporate welfare," a 
term implying a giveaway with no societal benefits. But the DOE has formed 
partnerships with the private sector to develop leapfrog 
technologies--such as the fuel cell, solar energy, and clean 
industrial, building, and transportation technologies--that will 
benefit many segments of our society.<P>
Americans today have a duty to eliminate the deficit, rooted in their 
obligation to future generations, but the country also needs to 
acknowledge that public investment in R&D, far from being corporate 
welfare, is an investment in America's own future. As the Yergin task 
force wrote, Americans have an obligation to "assure for future 
generations that our Nation's capacity to shape the future through 
scientific research and technological innovation is continually being 
renewed."<P>
The cuts planned for the energy-efficiency-and-renewable-energy 
program--30 percent this year and 60&#173;80 percent over the next 
several years--far exceed the cuts planned in overall domestic 
discretionary funding to balance the budget. The impact of such cuts will 
be enormous. <P>
Perhaps the only way to begin to realize the loss to the future is to look 
at the past. Federal investment in research and development for national 
needs has been one of the great success stories in twentieth-century 
America. Why does the United States retain leadership and strong exports 
in vital industries like aerospace, computers, and biomedicine? American 
ingenuity and the private sector have certainly been instrumental in each 
of these industries. Yet these industries have also enjoyed government 
support for decades. Who can doubt that a sustained high level of federal 
funding--eight times as much money as America's leading competitor 
provides--is responsible for U.S. leadership in biomedical and 
biotechnological research?<P>
As for computers and software, the Pentagon's <A 
HREF="http://www.arpa.mil/">Advanced Research Projects 
Agency</A> "virtually single-handedly created the United States' position 
of 
world leadership in computer sciences," according to a Harvard Business 
School case study on ARPA. And of all R&D dollars spent in the aircraft 
industry from 1945 to 1984, some 85 percent came from the federal 
government. In an unexpected benefit of the kind that is common in federal 
R&D, much of the turbine technology that is today generating electricity 
and helping to keep down utility rates had its roots in government-funded 
work on jet engines.<P>
John Preston, formerly the director of technology development for the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Congress in 1993, "It seems 
clear that when the government teams up with academia and industry, and 
participates throughout the spectrum of technology, the United States 
becomes dominant in that industry." America's technological lead in most 
kinds of fuel cells and photovoltaics stems from almost two decades of 
NASA, National Science Foundation, and Pentagon support, followed by 
almost two decades of DOE support.<P>
Some of the most pressing national needs in the coming decades are to 
reduce the country's huge and growing trade deficit in oil, to minimize 
any economic or political threat that might arise from the growing world 
dependence on Persian Gulf oil, to prevent pollution, to avoid 
irreversibly changing the global climate, and to capture a large share of 
the enormous potential market for energy and environmental technologies. 
Remarkably, a great many of the 
same R&D investments can simultaneously achieve all these ends while 
cost-effectively reducing the energy bills of businesses and consumers. 
Equally remarkably, Congress demonstrates an overwhelming desire to gut 
the funding for investments by the energy-efficiency-and-renewable-energy 
program, although it costs Americans only $4.00 per person a year.<P>
Nothing is clearer to those who study the matter than that the world is on 
the verge of a revolution in energy and environmental technologies--a 
revolution made possible by more than two decades of U.S. government 
investment. This revolution can be expected to create a number of 
industries that collectively will provide one of the largest international 
markets and one of the largest sources of new high-wage jobs in the next 
century, with annual sales in excess of $800 billion.<P>
Yet just as our foreign competitors are starting to catch on to the major 
trends in this American-led revolution, Congress wants to pull the federal 
government out of every relevant technology, leaving America on the 
sidelines, perhaps for good. Only a misbegotten ideology could conceive a 
blunder of such potentially historic proportions. <p>

	<i><font size=4>New ways to design, manufacture, and sell cars can make them ten times

	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	
	<font size=5>O</font>n September 29, 1993, the unthinkable happened. After decades of 
adversarial posturing, and months of intensive negotiations with Vice 
President Al Gore, the heads of the Big Three auto makers accepted 
President Bill Clinton's challenge to collaborate. They committed their 
best efforts, with the help of government technologies and funding, to 
developing a tripled-efficiency "clean car" within a decade, and a year 
later they reported encouraging progress. Like President John F. Kennedy's 
goal of putting people on the moon, the Partnership for a New Generation 
of Vehicles (PNGV) aims to create a leapfrog mentality--this time in 
Detroit. However, the PNGV's goal is both easier to attain and more 
important than that of the Apollo program. It could even become the core 
of a green industrial renaissance--instigating a profound change not only 
in what and how much we drive but in how our whole economy works.<P>
The fuel efficiency of cars has been stagnant for the past decade. Yet the 
seemingly ambitious goal of tripling it in the next decade can be far 
surpassed. Well before 2003 competition, not government mandates, may 
bring to market cars efficient enough to carry a family coast to coast on 
one tank of fuel, more safely and comfortably than they can travel now, 
and more cleanly than they would with a battery-electric car plus the 
power plants needed to recharge it.<P>
To understand what a profound shift in thinking this represents, imagine 
that one seventh of America's gross national product is derived from the 
Big Three typewriter makers (and their suppliers, distributors, dealers, 
and other attendant businesses). Over decades they've progressed from 
manual to electric to type-ball designs. Now they're developing tiny 
refinements for the forthcoming Selectric XVII. They profitably sell 
around 10 million excellent typewriters a year. But a problem emerges: the 
competition is developing wireless subnotebook computers.<P>
That's the Big Three auto makers today. With more skill than vision, 
they've been painstakingly pursuing incremental refinements on the way to 
an America where foreign cars fueled with foreign oil cross crumbling 
bridges. Modern cars are an extraordinarily sophisticated engineering 
achievement--the highest expression of the Iron Age. But they are 
obsolete, and the time for incrementalism is over. Striking innovations 
have occurred in advanced materials, software, motors, power electronics, 
microelectronics, electricity-storage devices, small engines, fuel cells, 
and computer-aided design and manufacturing. Artfully integrated, they can 
yield safe, affordable, and otherwise superior family cars getting 
hundreds of miles per gallon-
roughly ten times the 30 mpg of new cars today and several times the 
80-odd mpg sought by the PNGV.<P>
Achieving this will require a completely new car design-- the ultralight 
hybrid, or "hypercar" (a term we now prefer to our earlier term 
"supercar," because that also refers to ultrapowerful cars that get a 
couple of hundred miles per hour rather than per gallon). The hypercar's 
key technologies already exist. Many firms around the world are starting 
to build prototypes. The United States is best positioned to bring the 
concept to market--and had better do so, before others do. Hypercars, not 
imported luxury sedans, are the biggest threat to Detroit. But they are 
also its hope of salvation.<P><br>
<b>THE ULTRALIGHT STRATEGY</b><P>
<font size=5>D</font>ecades of dedicated effort to improve engines and power trains have 
reduced to only about 80-85 percent the portion of cars' fuel energy that 
is lost before it gets to the wheels. (About 95 percent of the resulting 
wheelpower hauls the car itself, so that less than two percent of the fuel 
energy actually ends up hauling the driver.)<P>
This appalling waste has a simple main cause: cars are made of steel, and 
steel is heavy, so powerful engines are required to accelerate them. Only 
about one sixth of the average engine's power is typically needed for 
highway driving, and only about one twentieth for city driving. Such gross 
oversizing halves the engine's average efficiency and complicates efforts 
to cut pollution. And the problem is getting worse: half the efficiency 
gains since 1985 have been squandered on making engines even more 
powerful.<P>
Every year auto makers add more gadgets to compensate a bit more for the 
huge driveline losses inherent in propelling steel behemoths. But a really 
efficient car can't be made of steel, for the same reason that a 
successful airplane can't be made of cast iron. We need to design cars 
less like tanks and more like airplanes. When we do, magical things start 
to happen, thanks to the basic physics of cars.<P>
Because about five to seven units of fuel are needed to deliver one unit 
of energy to the wheels, saving energy at the wheels offers immensely 
amplified savings in fuel. Wheelpower is lost in three ways. In city 
driving on level roads about a third of the wheelpower is used to 
accelerate the car, and hence ends up heating the brakes when the car 
stops. Another third (rising to 60-70 percent at highway speeds) heats the 
air the car pushes aside. The last third heats the tires and the road.<P>
The key to a superefficient car is to cut all three losses by making the 
car very light and aerodynamically slippery, and then recovering most of 
its braking energy. Such a design could:<ul>
<li> cut weight (hence the force required for acceleration) by 65-75 percent 
through the use of advanced materials, chiefly synthetic composites, while 
improving safety through greater strength and sophisticated design<P>
<li> cut aerodynamic drag by 60-80 percent through sleeker streamlining and 
more
compact packaging <P>
<li> cut tire and road energy loss by 65-80 percent through the combination 
of better tires and lighter weight.</ul><P>
Once this "ultralight strategy" has largely eliminated the losses of 
energy that can't be recovered, the only other place the wheelpower can go 
is into braking. And if the wheels are driven by special electric motors 
that can also operate as electronic brakes, they can convert unwanted 
motion back into useful electricity.<P>
However, a hypercar isn't an ordinary electric car, running on batteries 
that are recharged by being plugged into utility power. Despite impressive 
recent progress, such cars still can't carry very much or go very far 
without needing heavy batteries that suffer from relatively high cost and 
short life. Since gasoline and other liquid fuels store a hundred times as 
much useful energy per pound as batteries do, a long driving range is best 
achieved by carrying energy in the form of fuel, not batteries, and then 
burning that fuel as needed in a tiny onboard engine to make the 
electricity to run the wheel motors. A few batteries (or, soon, a 
carbon-fiber "superflywheel") can temporarily store the braking energy 
recovered from those wheel motors and reuse at least 70 percent of it for 
hill climbing and acceleration. With its power so augmented, the engine 
needs to handle only the average load, not the peak load, so it can shrink 
to about a tenth the current normal size. It will run at or very near its 
optimal point, doubling efficiency, and turn off whenever it's not 
needed.<P>
This arrangement is called a "hybrid-electric drive," because it uses 
electric wheel motors but makes the electricity onboard from fuel. Such a 
propulsion system weighs only about a fourth as much as that of a 
battery-electric car, which must haul a half ton of batteries down to the 
store to buy a six-pack. Hybrids thus offer the advantages of electric 
propulsion without the disadvantages of batteries.<P><br>
<b>ONE PLUS TWO EQUALS TEN</b><P>
<font size=5>A</font>uto makers and independent designers have already built experimental cars 
that are ultralight or hybrid-electric but seldom both. Yet combining 
these approaches yields extraordinary, and until recently 
little-appreciated, synergies. Adding hybrid
electric drive to an ordinary car increases its efficiency by about a 
third to a half. Making an ordinary car ultralight but not hybrid 
approximately doubles its efficiency. Doing both can boost a car's 
efficiency by about <i>tenfold</i>.<P>
This surprise has two main causes. First, as already explained, the 
ultralight loses very little energy irrecoverably to air and road 
friction, and the hybrid-electric drive recovers most of the rest from the 
braking energy. Second, saved weight compounds. When you make a heavy car 
one pound lighter, you in effect make it about a pound and a half lighter, 
because it needs a lighter structure and suspension, a smaller engine, 
less fuel, and so forth to haul that weight around. But in an ultralight, 
saving a pound may save more like five pounds, partly because power 
steering, power brakes, engine cooling, and many other normal systems 
become unnecessary. The design becomes radically simpler. Indirect weight 
savings snowball faster in ultralights than in heavy cars, faster in 
hybrids than in nonhybrids, and fastest of all in optimized combinations 
of the two.<P>
All the ingredients needed to capture these synergies are known and 
available. As far back as 1921 German auto makers demonstrated cars that 
were about twice as slippery aerodynamically as today's cars are. Most of 
the drag reduction can come from such simple means as making the car's 
underside as smooth as its top. Today's best experimental family cars are 
25 percent more slippery still. At the same time, ultrastrong new 
materials make the car's shell lighter. A lighter car needs a smaller 
engine, and stronger walls can be thin; both changes can make the car 
bigger inside but smaller outside. The smaller frontal area combines with 
the sleeker profile to cut through the air with about one third the 
resistance of today's cars. Advanced aerodynamic techniques may be able to 
double this saving.<P>
Modern radial tires, too, waste only half as much energy as 1970s bias-ply 
models, and the best 1990 radials roughly halve the remaining loss. 
"Rolling resistance" drops further in proportion to weight. The result is 
a 65-80 percent decrease in losses to rolling resistance, which heats the 
tires and the road.<P>
Suitable small gasoline engines, of the size found in outboard motors and 
scooters, can already be more than 30 percent efficient, diesels 40-50 
percent (56 percent in lab experiments). Emerging technologies also look 
promising, including miniature gas turbines and fuel cells--solid-state, 
no-moving-parts devices that silently and very efficiently turn fuel into 
electricity, carbon dioxide, water, and a greatly reduced amount of waste 
heat.<P>
In today's cars, accessories--power steering, heating, air conditioning, 
ventilation, lights, and entertainment systems--use about a tenth of the 
engine's power. But a hypercar would use scarcely more energy than that 
for all purposes, by saving most of the wheelpower and most of the 
accessory loads. Ultralights not only handle more nimbly, even without 
power steering, but also get all-wheel anti-lock braking and anti-slip 
traction from their special wheel motors. New kinds of headlights and 
taillights shine brighter on a third the energy, and can save even more 
weight by using fiber optics to distribute a single pea-sized lamp's light 
throughout the car. Air conditioning would need perhaps a tenth the energy 
used by today's car air conditioners, which are big enough for an Atlanta 
house. Special paints, vented double-skinned roofs, visually clear but 
heat-reflecting windows, solar-powered vent fans, and so forth can exclude 
unwanted heat; innovative cooling systems, run not directly by the engine 
but by its otherwise wasted by-product heat, can handle the rest.<P>
Perhaps the most striking and important savings would come in weight. In 
the mid-1980s many auto makers demonstrated "concept cars" that would carry four 
or five passengers but weighed as little as 1,000 pounds (as compared with 
today's average of about 3,200). Conventionally powered by internal 
combustion, they were two to four times as efficient as today's average 
new car. Those cars, however, used mainly light metals like aluminum and 
magnesium, and lightweight plastics. The same thing can be done better 
today with composites made by embedding glass, carbon, polyaramid, and 
other ultrastrong fibers in special moldable plastics--much as wood embeds 
cellulose fibers in lignin.<P>
In Switzerland, where more than 2,000 lightweight battery-electric cars (a 
third of the world's total) are already on the road, the latest roomy 
two-seaters weigh as little as 575 pounds without their batteries. 
Equivalent four-seaters would weigh less than 650 pounds, or less than 850 
including a whole hybrid propulsion system. Yet crash tests prove that 
such an ultralight can be at least as safe as today's heavy steel cars, 
even if it collides head-on with a steel car at high speed. That's because 
the composites are extraordinarily strong and bouncy, and can absorb far 
more energy per pound than metal can. Materials and design are much more 
important to safety than mere mass, and the special structures needed to 
protect people don't weigh much. (For example, about ten pounds of hollow, 
crushable carbon-fiber-and-plastic cones can absorb all the crash energy 
of a 1,200-pound car hitting a wall at 50 mph.) Millions have watched on 
TV as Indianapolis 500 race cars crashed into walls at speeds around 230 
mph: parts of the cars buckled or broke away in a controlled, 
energy-absorbing fashion, but despite per-pound crash energies many times 
those of highway collisions, the cars' structure and the drivers' 
protective devices prevented serious injury. Those were carbon-fiber 
cars.<P>
In 1991, fifty General Motors experts built an encouraging example of 
ultralight composite construction, the sleek and sporty four-seat, 
four-airbag Ultralite, which packs the interior space of a Chevrolet 
Corsica into the exterior size of a Mazda Miata. The Ultralite should be 
both safer and far cleaner than today's cars. Although it has only a 
111-horsepower engine, smaller than a Honda Civic's, its light weight 
(1,400 pounds) and low air drag, both less than half of normal, give it a 
top speed of 135 mph and a 0-to-60 acceleration of 7.8 seconds--comparable 
to a BMW 750iL with a huge V-12 engine. But the Ultralite is more than 
four times as efficient as the BMW, averaging 62 mpg--twice today's norm. 
At 50 mph it cruises at 100 mpg on only 4.3 horsepower, a mere fifth of 
the wheelpower normally needed.<P>
If equipped with hybrid drive, this 1991 prototype, built in only a 
hundred days, would be three to six times as efficient as today's cars. 
Analysts at Rocky Mountain Institute have simulated 300-400-mpg 
four-seaters with widely available technology, and cars getting more than 
600 mpg with the best ideas now in the lab. Last November a four-seater, 
1,500-pound Swiss prototype was reported to achieve 90 mpg cruising on the 
highway; at urban speeds, powered by its 573 pounds of batteries, it got 
the equivalent of 235 mpg.<P>
Similar possibilities apply to larger vehicles, from pickup trucks to 
eighteen
wheelers. A small Florida firm has tested composite delivery vans that 
weigh less loaded than normal steel vans weigh empty, and has designed a 
halved-weight bus. Other firms are experimenting with streamlined 
composite designs for big trucks. All these achieve roughly twice normal 
efficiency with conventional drivelines, and could redouble that with 
hybrids.<P>
Hypercars are also favorable to--though they don't require--ultraclean 
alternative fuels. Even a small, light, cheap fuel tank could store enough 
compressed natural gas or hydrogen for long-range driving, and the high 
cost of hydrogen would become unimportant if only a tenth as much of it 
were needed as would be to power cars like today's. Liquid fuels converted 
from sustainable farm and forestry wastes, too, would be ample to run such 
efficient vehicles without needing special crops or fossil hydrocarbons. 
Alternatively, solar cells on a hypercar's body could recharge its onboard 
energy storage about enough to power a standard southern-California 
commuting cycle without turning on the engine.<P>
Even if a hypercar used conventional fuel and no solar boost, its tailpipe 
could emit less pollution than would the power plants needed to recharge a 
battery-electric car. Being therefore cleaner, even in the Los Angeles air 
shed, than so-called zero-emission vehicles (actually "elsewhere-emission," mainly from dirty 
coal-fired power plants out in the desert), ultralight hybrids should 
qualify as ZEVs, and probably will. Last May the California Air Resources 
Board reaffirmed its controversial 1990 requirement--which some 
northeastern states want to adopt as well--that two percent of new-car 
sales in 1998, rising to 10 percent in 2003, be ZEVs. Previously this was 
deemed to mean battery-powered electric cars exclusively. But, mindful of 
hypercars' promise, the CARB staff is considering broadening the ZEV 
definition to include anything cleaner. This alternative compliance path 
could be a big boost both for hypercar entrepreneurs and for clean air: 
each car will be cleaner, and far more hypercars than battery cars are 
likely to be bought. By providing a large payload, unlimited range, and 
high performance even at low temperatures, hypercars vault beyond battery 
cars' niche-market limitations.<P>
This result brings full circle the irony of California's ZEV mandate. 
Originally it drew howls of anguish from auto makers worried that people 
would not buy enough of the costlier, limited-range cars it obliges them 
to sell. The business press ridiculed California for trying to prescribe 
an impractical direction of technological development. Yet that visionary 
mandate is creating the solution to the problems. Like the aerospace, 
microchip, and computer industries, hypercars will be the offspring of a 
technology-forcing government effort to steer the immense power of Yankee 
ingenuity. For it is precisely the California ZEV mandate that radically 
advanced electric-propulsion technology--thereby setting the stage for the 
happy combination with ultralight construction which we call the 
hypercar.<P><br>
<b>BEYOND THE IRON AGE</b><P>
<font size=5>T</font>he moldable synthetic materials in the GM and Swiss prototypes have 
fundamental advantages over the metals that now dominate auto making. The 
modern steel car, which costs less per pound than a McDonald's 
quarter-pound hamburger, skillfully satisfies often conflicting demands 
(to be efficient yet safe, powerful yet clean): steel is ubiquitous and 
familiar, and its fabrication is exquisitely evolved. Yet this standard 
material could be quickly displaced--as has happened before. In the 1920s 
the wooden framing of U.S. car bodies was rapidly displaced by steel. 
Today composites dominate boatbuilding and are rapidly taking over 
aerospace construction. Logically, cars are next.<P>
Driving this transition are the huge capital costs of designing, tooling, 
manufacturing, and finishing steel cars. For a new model, a thousand 
engineers spend a year designing and a year making half a billion dollars' 
worth of car-sized steel dies, the costs of which can take many years to 
be recovered. This inflexible tooling in turn demands huge production 
runs, maroons company-busting investments if products flop, and magnifies 
financial risks by making product cycles go further into the future than 
markets can be forecast. That this process works is an astonishing 
accomplishment, but it's technically baroque and economically perilous.<P>
Moldable composites must be designed in utterly different shapes. But 
their fibers can be aligned to resist stress and interwoven to distribute 
it, much as a cabinetmaker works with the grain of wood. Carbon fiber can 
achieve the same strength as steel at half to a third of the weight, and 
for many uses other fibers, such as glass and polyaramid, are as good as 
or better than steel and 50-85 percent cheaper. But composites' biggest 
advantages emerge in manufacturing.<P>
Only 15 percent of the cost of a typical steel car part is for the steel; 
the other 85 percent pays for pounding, welding, and smoothing it. But 
composites and other molded synthetics emerge from the mold already in 
virtually the required shape and finish. And large, complex units can be 
molded in one piece, cutting the parts count to about one percent of what 
is now normal, and the assembly labor and space to roughly 10 percent. The 
lightweight, easy-to-handle parts fit together precisely. Painting--the 
hardest, most polluting, and costliest step in auto making, accounting for 
nearly half the cost of painted steel body parts--can be eliminated by 
laid-in-the-mold color. Unless recycled, composites last virtually forever: they don't 
dent, rust, or chip. They also permit advantageous car design, including 
frameless monocoque bodies (like an egg, the body is the structure), whose 
extreme stiffness improves handling and safety.<P>
Composites are formed to the desired shape not by multiple strikes with 
tool-steel stamping dies but in single molding dies made of coated epoxy. 
These dies wear out much faster than tool-steel dies, but they're so cheap 
that their lack of durability doesn't matter. Total tooling cost per model 
is about half to a tenth that of steel, because far fewer parts are 
needed; because only one die set per part is needed, rather than three to 
seven for successive hits; and because the die materials and fabrication 
are much cheaper. Stereolithography--a three-dimensional process that 
molds the designer's computer images directly into complex solid objects 
overnight--can dramatically shrink tooling time. Indeed, the shorter life 
of epoxy tools is a fundamental strategic advantage, because it permits 
the rapid model changes and continuous improvement that product 
differentiation and market nimbleness demand--a strategy of small design 
teams, small production runs, a time to market of only weeks or months, 
rapid experimentation, maximum flexibility, and minimum financial risk.<P>
Together these advantages cancel or overturn the apparent cost 
disadvantage of the composites. Carbon fiber recently cost around forty 
times as much per pound as sheet steel, though increased production is 
leading manufacturers to quote carbon prices half to a quarter of that. 
Yet the cost of a mass-produced composite car is probably comparable to or 
less than that of a steel car, at both low production volumes (like 
Porsche's) and high ones (like Ford's). What matters is not cost per pound 
but cost per car: costlier fiber is offset by cheaper, more agile 
manufacturing.<P><br>
<b>SHIFTING GEARS IN COMPETITIVE STRATEGY</b><P>
<font size=5>U</font>ltralight hybrids are not just another kind of car. They will probably be 
made and sold in completely new ways. In industrial and market structure 
they will be as different from today's cars as computers are from 
typewriters, fax machines from telexes, and satellite pagers from the Pony 
Express.<P>
Many people and firms in several countries are starting to realize what 
hypercars mean; at least a dozen capable entities, including auto makers, 
want to sell them. This implies rapid change on an unprecedented scale. If 
ignored or treated as a threat rather than grasped as an opportunity, the 
hypercar revolution could cost the United States millions of jobs and 
thousands of companies. Auto making and associated businesses employ one 
seventh of U.S. workers (and close to two fifths of workers in some 
European countries). Cars represent a tenth of America's consumer 
spending, and use nearly 70 percent of the nation's lead, about 60 percent 
of its rubber, carpeting, and malleable iron, 40 percent of its machine 
tools, 15 percent of its aluminum, glass, and semiconductors, and 13 
percent of its steel. David Morris, a cofounder of the Institute for Local 
Self-Reliance, observes, "The production of automobiles is the world's 
number-one industry. The number-two industry supplies their fuel. Six of 
America's ten largest industrial corporations are either oil or auto 
companies. . . . A recent British estimate concludes that half of the 
world's earnings may be auto- or truck-related." Whether the prospect of 
hypercars is terrifying or exhilarating thus depends on how well we grasp 
and exploit their implications.<P>
The distribution of hypercars could be as revolutionary as their 
manufacture. On average, today's cars are marked up about 50 percent from 
production costs (which include profit, plant costs, and warrantied 
repairs). But cheap tooling might greatly reduce the optimal production 
scale for hypercars. Cars could be ordered directly from the local 
factory, made to order, and delivered to one's door in a day or two. 
(Toyota now takes only a few days longer than that with its steel cars in 
Japan.) Being radically simplified and ultra-reliable, they could be 
maintained by technicians who come to one's home or office (Ford does this 
in Britain today), aided by plug-into-the-phone remote diagnostics. If all 
this makes sense for a $1,500 mail-order personal computer, why not for a 
$15,000 car?<P>
Such just-in-time manufacturing would eliminate inventory, its carrying 
and selling costs, and the discounts and rebates needed to move existing 
stock that is mismatched to demand. The present markup could largely 
vanish, so that hypercars would be profitably deliverable at or below 
today's prices even if they cost considerably more to make, which they 
probably wouldn't.<P>
America leads--for now--both in start-up-business dynamism and in all the 
required technical capabilities. After all, hypercars are much more like 
computers with wheels than they are like cars with chips: they are more a 
software than a hardware problem, and competition will favor the 
innovative, not the big. Comparative advantage lies not with the most 
efficient steel-stampers but with the fastest
learning systems integrators--with innovative manufacturers like 
Hewlett-Packard and Compaq, and strategic-element makers like Microsoft 
and Intel, more than with Chrysler or Matsushita. But even big and able 
firms may be in for a rough ride: the barriers to market entry (and exit) 
should be far lower for hypercars than for steel cars. Much as in existing 
high-tech industries, the winners might be some smart, hungry, unknown 
aerospace engineers tinkering in a garage right now--founders of the next 
Apple or Xerox.<P>
All this is alien to the thinking of most (though not all) auto makers 
today. Theirs is not a composite-molding/electronics/software culture but 
a diemaking/steel-stamping/mechanical culture. Their fealty is to heavy metal, not light 
synthetics; to mass, not information. Their organizations are dedicated, 
extremely capable, and often socially aware, but have become prisoners of 
past expenditures. They treat those historical investments as unamortized 
assets, substituting accounting for economic principles and throwing good 
money after bad. They have tens of billions of dollars, and untold 
psychological investments, committed to stamping steel. They know steel, 
think steel, and have a presumption in favor of steel. They design cars as 
abstract art and then figure out the least unsatisfactory way to make 
them, rather than seeking the best ways to manufacture with strategically 
advantageous materials and then designing cars to exploit those 
manufacturing methods.<P>
The wreckage of the mainframe-computer industry should have taught us that 
one has to replace one's own products with better new products before 
someone else does. Until recently few auto makers appreciated the 
starkness of the threat. Their strategy seemed to be to milk old tools and 
skills for decades, watch costs creep up and market share down, postpone 
any basic innovation until after all the executives' planned retirement 
dates--and hope that none of their competitors was faster. That's a 
bet-the-company strategy, because even one superior competitor can put a 
company out of business, and the company may not even know who the 
competitor is until too late. The PNGV is stimulating instead a winning, 
risk-managed strategy: leapfrogging to ultralight hybrids.<P>
It is encouraging that some auto makers now show signs of understanding 
the problem. In recent months the PNGV has sparked new thinking in 
Detroit. The industry's more imaginative engineers are discovering that 
the next gains in car efficiency should be easier than the last ones were, 
because they will come not from sweating off fat ounce by ounce but from 
escaping an evolutionary trap. Although good ultralight hybrids need 
elegantly simple engineering, which is difficult, one can more easily 
boost efficiency tenfold with hypercars than threefold with today's 
cars.<P>
Little of this ferment is visible from the outside, because auto makers 
have learned reticence the hard way. A long and unhappy history of being 
required to do (or exceed) whatever they admit they can do has left them 
understandably bashful about revealing capabilities, especially to 
Congress. And firms with innovative ambitions will hardly be eager to 
telegraph them to competitors. Corporations share a natural desire to 
extract any possible business and political concessions, and to hold back 
from extending to traditional adversaries (such as the media, politicians, 
and environmentalists) any trust that could prove costly if abused or not 
reciprocated. Thus automakers are more likely to understate than to 
trumpet progress. Also, the Big Three are progressing unevenly, both 
internally and comparatively: their opacity conceals a rapidly changing 
mixture of exciting advances and inertia. Only some executives appreciate 
that hypercars fit the compelling strategic logic in favor of changing how 
their companies do business, especially by radically reducing cycle times, 
capital costs, and financial risks. It is difficult but vital for harried 
managers to focus on these goals through the distracting fog of fixing 
flaws in their short-term operations. But signs of rapid cultural change 
are looming, such as General Motors' announcement, last February 3, that 
its corporate policy now includes the CERES (Coalition for Environmentally 
Responsible Economies) Principles, formerly known as the Valdez 
Principles--a touchstone of environmentalists.<P><br>
<b>THE COST OF INACTION</b><P>
<font size=5>T</font>he potential public benefits of hypercars are enormous--in oil 
displacement, energy security, international stability, forgone military 
costs, balance of trade, climatic protection, clean air, health and 
safety, noise reduction, and quality of urban life. Promptly and 
skillfully exploited, hypercars could also propel an industrial renewal. 
They're good news for industries (many of them now demilitarizing) such as 
electronics, systems integration, aerospace, software, petrochemicals, and 
even textiles (which offer automated fiber-weaving techniques). The talent 
needed to guide the transition is abundant in American labor, management, 
government, and think tanks, but it's not yet mobilized. The costs of that 
complacency may be high.<P>
Cars and light trucks use about 37 percent of the nation's oil, about half 
of which is imported at a cost of around $50 billion a year. We Americans 
recently put our sons and daughters in 0.56 mpg tanks and 
17-feet-per-gallon aircraft carriers because we hadn't put them in 32 mpg 
cars--sufficient, even if we'd done nothing else, to have eliminated the 
need for American oil imports from the Persian Gulf. Of course, more than 
just oil was at stake in the Gulf War, but we would not have sent half a 
million troops there if Kuwait simply grew broccoli. Even in peacetime the 
direct cost to the nation of Persian Gulf oil--mostly paid not at the pump 
but in taxes for some $50 billion a year in military readiness to 
intervene in the Gulf--totals nearly $100 a barrel of crude, making it 
surely the costliest oil in the world.<P>
Had we simply kept on saving oil as effectively after 1985 as we had saved 
it for the previous nine years, we wouldn't have needed a drop of oil from 
the Persian Gulf since then. But we didn't--and it cost us $23 billion for 
extra imports in 1993 alone. Gulf imports were cut by about 90 percent 
from 1977 to 1985 (chiefly by federal standards that largely or wholly 
caused new-car efficiency to double from 1973 to 1986). Yet they are now 
reapproaching a historic high--the direct result of twelve years of a 
national oil policy consisting mainly of weakened efficiency standards, 
lavish subsidies, and the Seventh Fleet.<P>
The national stakes therefore remain large. And even though the PNGV is 
starting to re-create Detroit's sense of adventure, hypercars still face 
formidable obstacles, both culturally within the auto industry and 
institutionally in the marketplace. Whether or not their advantages make 
their ultimate adoption certain, the transition could be either 
unnecessarily disruptive, shattering industrial regions and job markets, 
or unnecessarily slow and erratic in capturing the strategic benefits of 
saving oil and rejuvenating the economy. Auto makers should be given 
strong incentives to pursue the leapfrog strategy boldly, and customers 
should be encouraged to overcome their well-known lack of interest in 
buying fuel-thrifty cars in a nation that insists on gasoline cheaper than

<b>MARKET CONDITIONING AND PUBLIC POLICY</b><P>
<font size=5>T</font>he usual prescription of economists, environmentalists, and the Big Three-
though, it seems, a politically suicidal one--is stiff gasoline taxes. 
After painful debate Congress recently raised the gasoline tax by 4.3 
cents a gallon, leaving the price, corrected for inflation, the lowest 
both in the industrial world and in U.S. history. But in Western Europe 
and Japan taxes that raise the price of motor fuel to two or four times 
that in the United States have long been in place, with unspectacular 
results. Gasoline costing two to five dollars a gallon has modestly 
reduced distances driven but has had less of an effect on the efficiency 
of new cars bought. New German and Japanese cars are probably less 
efficient than American ones, especially when performance, size, and 
features are taken into account. Costlier fuel is a feeble incentive to 
buy an efficient car, because the fuel-price signal is diluted (in the 
United States today, by seven to one) by the other costs of owning and 
running a car. It is, as well, weakened by high consumer discount rates 
over a brief expected ownership, and often vitiated by company-owned cars 
and other distortions that shield many drivers from their cars' costs.<P>
This market failure could be corrected by strengthening government 
efficiency standards. But standards, though effective and a valuable 
backstop, are not easy to administer, can be evaded, and are 
technologically static: they offer no incentive to keep doing better. 
Happily, at least one market-oriented alternative is available: the 
"feebate."<P>
Under the feebate system, when you buy a new car, you pay a fee or get a 
rebate. Which and how big depends on how efficient your new car is. Year 
by year the fees pay for the rebates. (This is not a new tax. In 1990 the 
California legislature agreed, approving a "Drive+" feebate bill by a 
seven-to-one margin, although outgoing Governor George Deukmejian vetoed 
it.) Better still, the rebate for an efficient new car could be based on 
how much more efficient it is than an old car that's scrapped (not traded 
in). A rebate of several thousand dollars for each 0.01-gallon-per-mile 
difference would pay about $5,000 to $15,000 of the cost of an efficient 
new car. That would rapidly get efficient, clean cars on the road and 
inefficient, dirty cars off the road (a fifth of the car fleet produces 
perhaps three fifths of its air pollution). The many variants of such 
"accelerated-scrappage" incentives would encourage competition, reward 
Detroit for bringing efficient cars to market, and open a market niche in 
which to sell them. Feebates might even break the political logjam that 
has long trapped the United States in a sterile debate over higher 
gasoline taxes versus stricter fuel-efficiency standards--as though those 
were the only policy options and small, slow, incremental improvements 
were the only possible technical ones.<P>
Perhaps people would buy hypercars, just as they switched from vinyl 
records to compact discs, simply because they're a superior product: cars 
that could make today's most sophisticated steel cars seem clunky and 
antiquarian by comparison. If that occurred, gasoline prices would become 
uninteresting. Scholastic debates about how many price elasticities can 
dance on the head of a pin would die away. The world oil price would 
permanently crash as superefficient vehicles saved as much oil as OPEC now 
extracts. Feebates would remain helpful in emboldening and rewarding 
Detroit for quick adaptation, but perhaps would not be essential. The 
ultralight hybrid would sweep the market. What then?<P>
Then we would discover that hypercars cannot solve the problem of too many 
people driving too many miles in too many cars; indeed, they could 
intensify it, by making driving even more attractive, cheaper, and nearly 
free per extra mile driven. Having clean, roomy, safe, recyclable, 
renewably fueled 300 mpg cars doesn't mean that eight million New Yorkers 
or a billion still-carless Chinese can drive them. Drivers would no longer 
run out of oil or air but would surely run out of roads, time, and 
patience. Avoiding the constraint du jour requires not only having great 
cars but also being able to leave them at home most of the time. This in 
turn requires real competition among all modes of access, including those 
that displace physical mobility, such as telecommunications. The best of 
them is already being where we want to be--achievable only through 
sensible land use.<P>
Such competition requires a level playing field with honest pricing, so 
that drivers (and everyone else) will both get what they pay for and pay 
for what they get. But least-cost choices are inhibited today by central 
planning and socialized financing of car-based infrastructure, such as 
roads and parking, while alternative modes must largely pay their own way. 
Happily, emerging policy instruments could foster and monetize fair 
competition among all modes of access. Some could even make markets in 
"negamiles" and "negatrips," wherein we could discover what it's worth 
paying people to stay off the roads so that we needn't build and mend them 
so much and suffer delays and pollution. Congestion pricing, zoning 
reforms, parking feebates, pay-at-the-pump car insurance, 
commuting-efficient mortgages, and a host of other innovations beckon 
state, local, and corporate experimenters. Yet unless basic and 
comprehensive transport and land-use reforms emerge in parallel with 
hypercars, cars may become apparently benign before we've gotten good 
enough at not needing to drive them--and may thus derail the reformers.<P>
If the technical and market logic sketched here is anywhere near right, we 
are all about to embark on one of the greatest adventures in industrial 
history. Whether we will also have the wisdom to build a society worth 
driving in--one built around people, not cars--remains a greater 
challenge. As T. S. Eliot warned, "A thousand policemen directing the 
traffic / Cannot tell you why you come or where you go."<P></blockquote>

	<font size=5>P</font>aul Gagnon's <A 

	HREF="../95dec/Chilearn/chilearn.htm">"What Should Children Learn?"</A> 

	(December <i>Atlantic</i>) is

merely the latest bashing of American schools by someone who does not work in

them. <p>



Gagnon's reference to "our 25 percent dropout rate" is erroneous. In fact 83

percent of U.S. students graduate on time. Another four percent obtain GEDs,

and another four percent return to obtain a diploma after initially dropping

out.<p>



And they are not merely being socially promoted on the basis of seat time. Many

achievement-test scores are at all-time highs, many trends on the National

Assessment of Educational Progress are at all-time highs, the proportion of

students scoring above 650 on the math SAT is at an all-time high, and the

number of students taking advanced-placement tests has quintupled since 1978.

American students finished second among thirty-one nations in a 1992 study of

reading skills, and their 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles were the largest in

the world.<p>



Gagnon is at best functioning as a sophist when he says that the Committee of

Ten called for a rigorous curriculum "for all high school students <i>whether

or not they were going to college</i>." That's true, but the committee knew

that in 1894 only seven percent of age-eligible students were even <i>enrolled

</i>in high school. Gagnon chides Life Adjustment education for being

anti-intellectual, but at least its advocates were trying to cope with 100

percent of the population.<p>

	<i>Educational Researcher and Writer; <br>Executive Director, <br>Alliance for

Curriculum Reform<br>Alexandria, Va.</i><p>

	

	<br><br><br>

	

<font size=5>T</font>he pretense of neutrality undermines Paul Gagnon's case in "What Should

Children Learn?" It is precisely the notion of a fixed human nature that

historical revisionism rejects. That is why a content-based history organized

around agreed-upon standards is impossible as long as the academy and the

educational bureaucracy and unions are under the control of leftists who

operate on the assumptions that humanity is infinitely malleable, that there

are no "origins," that there are no "essentials of U.S. or world history" (no

masterpieces, no authentically seminal events, no heroes, no individuals of

global significance outside savage "cults of personality"), that history is

written by the winners to legitimize their status in an elitist hierarchy, and

that "history has no subject" aside from pure power relations.<p>

	<br><br><br>

	

<font size=5>P</font>aul Gagnon's proposal that education reform be returned to the local

level because of the failure to develop national standards is faulty from the

beginning.<p>



In the first place, he assumes, incorrectly, that the national public education

system is controlled by a gargantuan bureaucracy of mindless educators, which

he euphemistically refers to as the "educational establishment." In fact

education in this country is in the hands of the more than 100,000 lay persons

who sit on the autonomous boards of some 16,000 local school districts. The

average tenure of superintendents who offer professional leadership to

policymaking boards is about seven years--a fact that belies the assumption

that educators are in charge. <p>



Public schools in this country are little more than reflections of the quality

of life in the communities they serve. Any measure of academic standards

applied to students can be highly correlated to a number of economic, cultural,

ethnic, and political factors that profile the community where those students

attend school. Expecting schools to reform society is like asking a mirror to

improve the images it reflects. <p>

    <br><br><br>

	

<font size=5>I</font> could not agree more strongly with Paul Gagnon's argument that the

original draft of the history standards (I have not seen the latest revision)

placed far too much emphasis on matters not central to the role of a U.S.

citizen in the twenty-first century. The history panel was led down the same

path of overspecification that brought the arts panel to grief. However, I

don't believe that most Americans really wish to have their children read and

understand (to mention just a few of Gagnon's examples) "Hobbes, Locke, and

Montesquieu, Burke, Paine, the Federalists and the anti-Federalists" as

background for the study of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I

think Debra Wadsworth, in the recent Public Agenda Foundation report, is on the

mark when she says that Public Agenda found "a surprising degree of disdain

toward highly educated people and some sense of antagonism toward an

educational cultural elite." Until public attitudes toward learning change,

Wadsworth, Gagnon, and those who write letters to <i>The</i> <i>Atlantic

</i>are merely talking to ourselves.<p>

	<i>Paul Gagnon replies:</i><p>



Gerald Bracey disputes my 25 percent dropout rate, but the latest figures from

the National Center for Education Statistics show that 73.4 percent of the

appropriate age group earned high school diplomas in 1994-1995, much like the

73.2 percent of 1990-1991, the year my article cites. The NCES "dropout" rate

of only 10.5 percent for 1994-1995 ignores the "institutionalized," those not

in households, and those who never start high school at all. The Committee of

Ten sought equal and democratic schooling precisely because its members

expected a rapid rise in numbers of high school students, well beyond the 1894

percentages. Bob Whetstone says I assign school reform to the local level, but

I suggest something very different: <i>local implementation</i> of statewide

standards.<p>



Sadly, these letters either excuse unequal schools or seem resigned to them

because obstacles to change are too much for us. We are to think that

Americans, unique in the world, are so beset by awful forces (apathy, taxes,

conspiracies, unreformable communities) that we cannot do for our children what

others do for theirs. American exceptionalism--once too prideful--is turned on

its head, now to be abject. Happily, most letters from parents and teachers see

things differently and say we can do better.<p>

	<A NAME="lead poisoning"><H3>Lead Poisoning</H3></A>

	

	<font size=5>E</font>llen Ruppel Shell's insinuation that the hazards of lead poisoning have been

exaggerated to manipulate public policy to extremist ends is unfounded (<A 

HREF="../95dec/lead/lead.htm">"An

Element of Doubt,"</A> December <i>Atlantic</i>). <p>



First, the evidence is solid that lead poisoning is a serious public-health

problem. Thousands of laboratory, clinical, and population-based studies

conclusively document lead's adverse effects. The Bush Administration's

decision to reduce the threshold for lead in blood was justified (indeed,

necessitated) by the cumulative weight of evidence, including more than a dozen

epidemiological studies in the United States and abroad demonstrating that

low-level lead poisoning has a debilitating effect on children's intelligence,

hearing, attention span, learning, and behavior.<p>



Over the past two decades lead levels have decreased dramatically in the United

States, owing to the ban on lead in gasoline. But this impressive public-health

achievement is no reason to abandon efforts to protect those children still at

risk. <p>



With the active support of public-health advocates, the goal of national policy

has been redirected to lead-safe (rather than lead-free) housing. Shell's

reading of the 1992 federal law is backwards: rather than promoting "the

widespread removal of lead paint," it sanctioned strategies to manage existing

lead paint and narrowed the focus to exposure hazards--primarily deteriorating

paint and dust. The irony Shell tries to find in my family's living in a home

with lead paint demonstrates her ignorance of national consensus

recommendations for lead-safe housing.<p>



    <strong>Don Ryan</strong><br>



    <i>Executive Director, Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning</i><br>



    <i>Washington, D.C.</i><p>

 	

	<br><br><br>

	

	

		<font size=5>E</font>llen Shell's article is an ill-informed attack on the scientific basis for one

of the most successful public-health programs of this century: the reduction in

Americans' lead exposure. <p>



Shell gets some big facts wrong. We have not "kicked the lead habit," despite

significant controls (some by the voluntary action of private industry) on lead

in gasoline, paint, food cans, and plumbing. We are using more lead than ever,

according to the U.S. Bureau of Mines. Lead in lead paint, even in large chips

and fragments, is unfortunately bioavailable. X-rays have shown large pieces of

paint in the stomachs of children who were exposed by chewing and eating

flaking paint. The lead in soil often comes from exterior paints as well as

from gasoline. However, when lead-based paint is present inside homes, it

dominates as the source of lead in household dust. Children's blood lead rarely

doubles in the summertime; the fluctuations in blood levels often reflect

changes in absorption as well as distribution of lead between blood and bone.

<p>



Shell claims that no study has separated lead from other factors that can

affect children's neurobehavior and performance on intellectual and

developmental tests. Shell either rejected or did not know about many large

prospective studies investigating the association between lead and children's

attainment; these were controlled explicitly in study design, subject

selection, and analysis for the important socioeconomic and familial factors.

<p>



Shell accuses many of us who were involved in these victories of prolonging the

struggle artificially, for self-serving or institutional reasons. I live in a

city where the median blood-lead level, as of 1993, was still 10 micrograms per

deciliter, where public-health and housing departments lag far behind in

managing cases of frank lead toxicity, and where the goal of primary prevention

remains an unfulfilled dream. <p>

	<br><br><br>

	

	

	<font size=5>E</font>llen Shell claims that the government arbitrarily reset the definition

of poisoning at a blood-lead level below 25 micrograms per deciliter. "With the

stroke of a pen . . . the CDC changed 'lead poisoning' from a clear diagnosis

to a murky condition." In fact this new definition of toxicity was arrived at

after five years of study by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA used

about sixty external consultants and came to the conclusion that children's IQ

scores were lowered at blood-lead levels of 10 or perhaps lower. The Centers

for Disease Control committee, twenty-five people from many disciplines,

reviewed all these data in setting their guidelines. Their decision was no

rhetorical pen stroke but the consequence of an intense and critical review.<p>



Human epidemiological studies have their limits. Because we cannot give lead in

measured doses to matched children, we must study it as nature and human

activity distribute it to our subjects. There are, however, a number of elegant

studies of animals given lead at closely controlled doses. In both monkeys and

rodents behavioral measures showed effects closely resembling those found in

children. This is a powerful refutation of the argument that the lead effect is

actually due to socioeconomic factors. Shell nowhere indicates that there are

such data. <p>



Of my work Shell writes: "But although he is lauded for his crusade by

policymakers, journalists, and child advocates, Needleman has come under heavy

fire from scientists." Exactly two scientists have directed their fire at me.

Both were defense witnesses in a $100 million lawsuit brought by the Department

of Justice and the EPA against the owners of a lead mill and mine. I was the

principal government health witness. The suit was settled in favor of the

government. These two defense witnesses alleged that I had manipulated the data

in my research. This charge was investigated by my university and the Public

Health Service. Both investigative committees found that every one of the

allegations brought by these two people was false, and I am attempting to have

this corrected through the court. The committees did state that I had made two

deliberate errors in reporting. <p>

The characterization of lead poisoning, a serious but rare condition, as a

"national epidemic" is a dangerous rhetorical device that has frightened

parents and misled legislators. The selective appraisals and conclusions of Don

Ryan, Ellen Silbergeld, and Herbert Needleman, respectively executive director,

board member, and founding board member of the Alliance to End Childhood Lead

Poisoning, differ significantly from those of many other investigators. Two

major reviews of the epidemiological evidence on environmental lead and

children's intelligence (including several papers published by Dr. Needleman)

conclude that much uncertainty remains as to the impact of  mildly elevated

blood leads (at levels of 10 to 20 micrograms per deciliter of blood) on

children's health.<p>



Mr. Ryan may have somehow determined that his home is lead-safe, but the

consensus document from which he quotes makes the rather vague claim that 5 to

15 million housing units are not, and that many more will become unsafe as they

age. The document advocates the containment of homes with lead hazards as

merely an interim measure, and suggests that "other housing containing

lead-based paint" be dealt with once "scarce resources" become available. The

document states that "relatively little has been done to determine the most

cost-effective strategies for evaluating and controlling lead hazards in

housing"; it also makes clear that there is no consensus as to what constitutes

a permanently lead-safe house, save a house devoid of lead.<p>



In 1992 a committee of his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh found Dr.

Needleman guilty of the "deliberate misrepresentation" of procedures. Although

he was not found guilty of scientific misconduct, the National Institutes of

Health Office of Research Integrity, far from exonerating him, confirmed that

he had used "substandard" methodology and that his reports contained "numerous

errors and misstatements."<p>



Childhood blood-lead levels have dropped sharply over the past two decades,

corresponding with a well-documented increase in violence and learning

disabilities. Yet no right-thinking person would conclude from this that the

lowering of blood leads has resulted in such negative effects. What is likely

is that the increase in our children's behavioral and learning difficulties has

little to do with lead and a great deal to do with poverty and societal

disruption.<p>

AN the wishes of two Presidents, Republican and Democratic, of most
governors, of several Congresses, and of up to 80 percent of  the American
public and teachers simply be ignored? So it seems. Over the past five 
years
all of them have called for national academic standards, to make schools
stronger and more equal. But their will has been frustrated by the 
century-old
habits of American educators unable to conceive of excellence and equity
co-existing in the schools most children have to attend. This makes a
depressing story, but some of it needs telling if those children are to 
see a
happy ending. For to succeed where national efforts failed, state and local
school leaders, teachers, parents, and citizens need to understand what 
they
are up against, what has to be done differently, and how much is at 
stake.</font>  <p>

	</A>
They can begin by recognizing, and tolerating no longer, the vast inertia 
of an
educational establishment entrenched in many university faculties of 
education;
in well-heeled interest associations, with their bureaucracies, journals, 
and
conventions; in hundreds of research centers and consulting firms; in 
federal,
state, and local bureaucracies; in textbook-publishing houses and the
aggressive new industries of educational technology and assessment. On the
whole this establishment is well-meaning, and it is not monolithic, all of 
one
mind. But its mainstream, trained and engrossed in the means rather than 
the
academic content of education, instinctively resists any reform that starts
with content and then lets it shape everything else--most certainly the 
means.
<p>

Starting school reform by first deciding what every child should learn 
strikes
most people as only common sense. But to many American educators, it spells
revolutionary change. The standards strategy for school reform would give
subject-matter teachers and scholars, and the educated public, 
unprecedented
power to spur genuine change--change far deeper than questions of school
choice, methods, or management. Means and management are not the problem. 
The
overused business analogy breaks down: business first decides the content 
of
its product; means follow. But educators, unwilling to focus on subject 
matter,
have never decided what content everyone should know; the curriculum stays
frozen, incoherent and unequal. For more than a decade American citizens 
have
wanted high, common standards--the only new idea for their schools in a
century. But to get them, they will have to work around the establishment, 
and
overturn the status quo.<p>

			<img src="./cliff.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="">


The first step toward change was taken in 1983, when the National 
Commission on
Excellence in Education delivered a ringing wake-up call: "If an unfriendly
foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational
performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of 
war."
The commission's report, <a href="http://www.ed.gov/pubs/NatAtRisk/"><i>A 
Nation at Risk</i></a>, told us that other countries'
schools were doing better in both quality and equality of learning--and 
ours
were losing ground on each count. In the commission's words, "a rising 
tide of
mediocrity" belied our democratic promise that "all, regardless of race or
class or economic status, are entitled to a fair chance and to the tools 
for
developing their individual powers of mind and spirit to the utmost."<p>

<i>A Nation at Risk</i> gave rise to the standards strategy for school
improvement, talk or the avoidance of which has preoccupied American 
educators
ever since. It said that all high school students, regardless of 
background or
vocational prospects, needed a common core curriculum of four years of 
English,
three years each of mathematics, science, and social studies, and a 
semester of
computer science. The college-bound should add two years of foreign 
language.
In the early 1980s only 13.4 percent of our high school graduates had 
taken the
first four of those "new basics." Adding the computer semester dropped the
percentage all the way to 2.7, and adding foreign language made it 1.9.
"Mediocrity" was a mild word for what was going on. But the public paid
attention: many states and districts raised their core academic 
requirements,
over the objections of experts who declared that dropout rates would soar, 
for
minorities most of all.<p>

By 1990, the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/pubs/stats.html
">National Center for Education Statistics</a> found, 39.8 percent of
high school graduates had taken the recommended years of English, 
mathematics,
science, and social studies; 22.7 percent added the computer semester; 17.3
percent added both computers and the foreign language. Instead of rising, 
the
dropout rate for African-Americans declined, and for Hispanics remained 
roughly
stable. The percentage of African-American students taking the required 
years
of academic subjects rose from 10.1 to 41.1; for Hispanics it rose from 
6.3 to
32.7. "Top-down" recommendations, with state and local implementation, had 
made
a difference, and they continue, albeit at a slower rate, to do so. <p>

The glass, however, is still at best half full. And by comparison with the
democratization of public schools in other countries, it is well under half
empty. Our 25 percent dropout rate means that the roughly 40 percent of 
high
school graduates in 1990 who got the recommended classes made up only 30
percent of all young people of that age. In 1991, in two school systems at
opposite ends of the earth, about two thirds of the corresponding Japanese 
and
French age groups completed markedly more-demanding academic programs, 
which
included foreign languages. In both countries about half the students were 
in
programs combining technical and liberal education. Even disregarding 
foreign
languages, relatively few of our young people graduate from academic 
programs
that are as rigorous as those abroad. For fully equivalent programs, a 
generous
estimate of American completion would be 15 percent--about a quarter of the
French and Japanese completion rate.<p>

We used to say--and too many educators still say--that we cannot compare 
our
schools with those of other countries, because they educate only an elite 
and
we try to educate everybody. Untrue for thirty years, this is now the 
opposite
of the truth. They educate the many, and we the few. To our shame, a
disadvantaged child has a better chance for an equal and rigorous 
education,
and whatever advancement it may bring, in Paris or Copenhagen than in one 
of
our big cities.<p>

Comparing curricula makes us look bad enough, but what is behind the course
titles on student transcripts? Are American courses as substantial as those
abroad? To make them so, President George Bush and the nation's governors
launched a movement to set national standards for course content at 
meetings in
Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1989. <a 
href="http://www.ed.gov/pubs/goals/summary/goals.html">Goal Three of their 
statement</a> insisted that
course content be academically "challenging," comparable to that in the 
best
schools here and overseas, and--for equity--that all students be offered 
such
content and be expected to master it. Polls showed overwhelming public 
support,
even for a national curriculum. <p>

Shortly after, Congress set up a National Council on Education Standards 
and
Testing, to "advise on the desirability and feasibility of national 
standards
and tests." In its report of January, 1992, the council recommended both.
National content standards, it said, ought to "define what students should 
know
and be able to do" in English, geography, history, mathematics, and 
science,
"with other subjects to follow." A core of common content was needed to
"promote educational equity, to preserve democracy and enhance the civic
culture, and to improve economic competitiveness." It should set high
expectations, not minimal competencies; it should provide focus and 
direction,
not a national curriculum. <p>

The ball was handed off to the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">U.S. 
Department of Education</a>, which in turn
funded privately based consortia of scholars and teachers to decide what 
was
most worth learning in each major subject. The stage was set to open equal
opportunities for learning, to temper the curricular chaos of 15,000 school
districts, so that children would no longer be entirely at the mercy of 
where
or to whom they were born. Some of us in the Department of Education were 
sure
it could be done. We were wrong. The department itself never decided how 
the
standards strategy ought to work, or how to explain it to others. Last year
four of the national projects it had commissioned--in the arts, civics,
geography, and history--issued their documents. (Science and 
foreign-language
projects are still under way. A math project had been separately completed 
in
1991.) After spending more than $900,000, the English project had been 
defunded
for nonperformance, its professional associations unable to do for our 
language
and literature what other nations have done for theirs. (One subcommittee
solemnly voted that the phrase "standard English" be replaced by 
"privileged
dialect.") Only the civics document earned countrywide respect. The others 
met
with disbelief and complaint over their length and extravagant demands. The
American-history standards set off an ideological conflict that is still
boiling, an issue for presidential candidates at campaign stops. (For an
examination of the disappointing standards for world history, see page 
74.)<p>

A year after the standards projects reported, the national version of
standards-based reform is dead of multiple wounds, some self-inflicted, 
others
from our culture wars, still others from congressional antipathy to any 
federal
initiative, and most from American educators who have long resisted
establishing a common core of academic learning. Recovery now depends on 
the
states' choosing their own standards. But where a well-funded nationwide 
effort
collapsed, how can states step in and do it right? Are we as a people 
ready to
apply the standards of our very best schools, public and private, to all 
the
others, and reform a system that is generally mediocre and shamefully 
unequal? A
century of avoidance says no. <p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC1">THE
TEN 
</a>
<a name="RTFToC2">AND
THE NINE
</a></h3>
<font size=5>T</font>HE idea that democratic education requires a 
rigorously academic core for
every student is not new. The report of the illustrious Committee of Ten,
published in 1894, forcefully articulated it, calling for an established
academic curriculum for all high school students, <i>whether or not they 
were
going to college</i>. Italics are needed, for the committee was falsely 
accused
in its time of caring only for the college-bound, and thus of being 
elitist and
anti-democratic. This line is still taken by educators who have not read 
the
report.<p>

The story of the Ten's defeat and the triumph of progressive education's
dumbed-down version of John Dewey's ideas, which reads eerily like the 
failure
of the national-standards movement today, is best told in Richard 
Hofstadter's
<i>Anti-Intellectualism in American Life,</i> which won the Pulitzer Prize 
in
1964. Chaired by Charles William Eliot, the president of Harvard, the 
Committee
of Ten was made up of six university scholars (several had taught in 
secondary
schools), three high school principals, including the head of the Girls' 
High
School in Boston, and William T. Harris, the U.S. Commissioner of 
Education.
The common core they advocated required four years of foreign language and
English language and literature, three to four years of math and science, 
and
two to four years of history. Young Americans taking on the profession of
citizen, they said, needed a demanding curriculum, not the "feeble and 
scrappy"
courses offered in too many high schools. This was doubly important for 
"school
children who have no expectation of going to college," so that they might 
have
at maturity "a salutary influence" upon the affairs of the country.<p>

The report could have been written today. It anticipated the progressive
pedagogical agenda and our latest "innovations" as well. It decried the 
"dry
and lifeless system of instruction by text-book." Facts alone were 
repellent;
schooling was for "the invaluable mental power which we call the 
judgment." It
deplored mere coverage. To reach a common core of essentials, less was 
more:
"select the paramount." The committee argued for active inquiry in original
sources, studies in depth, individual and group projects, seminars, 
debates and
re-enactments, field trips, museum work, mock legislatures and 
conventions. All
possible teaching aids should be used: engravings, photographs, maps, 
globes,
and the "magic lantern." To make time, school hours needed to be longer and
more flexible. <p>

For the new curriculum the Ten urged that history, civil government, and
geography be taught as one. They wanted history and English "intimately
connected," with constant cross-referencing to other countries and eras, to
literature and art. They wanted more time for foreign languages, starting 
in
the elementary grades. The continuing education of teachers needed more
rigor--courses during the school year, taught by university scholars, for
teachers who needed "the spirit or the apparatus to carry their classes 
outside
. . . [the] narrow limits" of textbooks. Educators today reinvent these
century-old ideas and declare them "exciting," as though nobody 
before--least
of all academicians--could have thought such things.<p>

The Ten's marriage of common substance and varied methods--exactly the 
object
of today's standards strategy--was broken by the advent of a new corps of
nonacademic educators who argued that common requirements would force a
multitude of students to drop out. In 1911 a Committee of Nine on the
Articulation of High School and College turned the Ten on their heads. The
Nine, primarily public school administrators, insisted that school "holding
power" depended on meeting interests that "each boy and girl has at the 
time."
To focus on academics was to enslave the high school to the college, and 
lead
students away from "pursuits for which they are adapted" toward those "for
which they are not adapted and in which they are not needed." Schools 
should
focus on industrial arts, agriculture, and "household science." <p>

The influence of what Hofstadter called an "anti-intellectualist movement" 
also
stood out in <i>Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education</i>, issued in 
1918
by the National Education Association's Commission on the Reorganization of
Secondary Education, and nationally distributed by the U.S. Office of
Education. Again made up of administrators, the commission included no 
academic
subjects in its list of seven things high schools ought to teach: health,
command of fundamental processes (the three Rs), "worthy" home membership,
"worthy" use of leisure, vocation, citizenship, and ethical character. This
report, too, could have been written today, by the promoters of 
content-free
brands of "outcomes-based education," which they celebrate as new and
"transformational."<p>
<pre>

</pre>


<h3>
<a name="RTFToC3">MASS
TRIAGE
</a></h3>
<font size=5>F</font>ROM the 1920s on, vast numbers of children were 
locked into curricular tracks
and "ability groups" on the basis of surface differences--race, ethnicity,
language, social class, sex, "deportment," and intelligence as categorized 
by
inane notions of testing--that had nothing to do with their potential. At 
the
low point of this mass triage, leaders of the "Life Adjustment" movement 
of the
1940s consigned up to 80 percent of all American children and adolescents 
to
the nonacademic heap. Hofstadter called it the most anti-democratic moment 
in
the history of schooling. In the next decade James Bryant Conant's 
influential
book <i>The American High School Today</i> (1959) still sought no common
academic core and considered no more than 20 percent of students as
"academically talented." The rest, Conant said, should "follow vocational 
goals
and . . . develop general interests." And in <i>The Education of American
Teachers</i> (1963), Conant added that at the university level "a 
prescription
of general education is impossible unless one knows, at least 
approximately,
the vocational aspirations of the group in question."<p>

Thus spoke mainstream American educators, habitually failing to recall the
three distinct purposes of schooling--for work, for public affairs, for 
private
culture--and ever unable to imagine what free people could be as citizens 
or
private personalities outside their daily work. From the report of the 
Nine to
the present, educators (including those at many universities) have put
socializing the masses and job training ahead of intellect. At different 
times
socializing takes on various looks from group to group, left to right. But 
its
common root is distrust of ordinary people's minds and spirit. Unable to 
think
and seek the good, ordinary people must be socially engineered to amuse
themselves and to behave. We boast of escaping the old world's class 
system,
but cherish our own brand of social privilege. Academic standards, 
educators
have said for a century, are not for everyone--as though most people do not
deserve or need a liberal education, as though we want them not as equals 
but
only to work and to buy, Beta-minuses out of Aldous Huxley's <i>Brave New
World</i>. To feel better, we tell one another the story that schools can 
be
"different but equal," a swindle still outliving its twin, "separate but
equal." <p>

In contrast, the cataclysms of depression and war brought educators in 
Europe
to other views by the 1950s: it was time to democratize their schools, by
leveling upward. As European secondary schools were opened to all, the
political parties of the left resolved that the children of workers and the
poor should gain whatever personal and political power they could from the 
same
academic curriculum formerly reserved to the few.<p>

A generation earlier America had leveled downward, accepting a dual, 
unequal
school system sold to trusting citizens with warm words of solicitude by
expert-specialists. In fact those specialists were perpetuating elitism by
denouncing liberal education as elitist. Europeans were not so trusting as 
we,
either of experts or of one another. Out of revolution and class conflict 
they
had raised wariness to a high art, looking behind words for consequences. 
In
Europe the schools had been battlegrounds for ideas about human nature,
religion, history, national honor, and democracy itself. European 
democrats who
had suffered Nazi occupation were not about to accept the notion that 
schools
could be different but equal.<p>

Had we looked overseas after midcentury, we could have learned from both 
our
allies and our enemies in the Second World War. But we did not and still do
not. Those most reluctant to look abroad are the promoters of giddy 
educational
fixes that no foreign country would take seriously, from subjecting 
schools to
the "free market" all the way to killing off academic disciplines in favor 
of
"issue-based inquiry." Albert Shanker, the president of the American 
Federation
of Teachers, puts it squarely, as usual: Americans tolerate a "marked
inequality of opportunity in comparison with Germany, France, or Japan." 
Why do
students work harder in those countries, with the same TV and pop culture 
to
distract them? Because their educators have decided what all students 
should
know by the end of high school, Shanker says, and they have "worked back 
from
these goals to figure out what children should learn by the time they are 
ages
fourteen and nine." Standards are universal and known by everyone, so 
"fewer
students are lost--and fewer teachers are lost."<p>
<pre>

</pre>


<h3>CONTENT-BASED 

<a name="RTFToC4">REFORM</a></h3><p>
 <font size=5>G</font>RANTED, the U.S. Department of Education's own 
ambivalence did not help the
standards strategy's reception. What could easily have been explained as a
necessarily slow four-step process--in which most important decisions 
would be
left to states, local districts, schools, and teachers--remained in 
confusion.
And when expensive standards projects refused to discipline themselves and
lugged forth great tomes that looked like national curricula, the 
department
gave up trying. It let go the idea of a national core of essential 
learning and
decided to say that setting standards was now up to the states. <p>

Having fifty sets of standards need not mean disaster. But the Committee 
of Ten
was right: something close to national agreement on a vital common core is
indispensable to educational equity, to dislodge and replace the empty,
undemanding programs that leave so many children untaught and 
disadvantaged.
Without some such agreement, the much-heralded devolution of reform 
leadership
to the states could make things worse. <p>

The four steps essential to content-based school reform are no mystery. But
conventional educators will object to them, for they focus on subject 
matter
and must be carried out by subject-matter teachers and scholars, not by
curriculum specialists unlearned in academic disciplines. In step one, 
teachers
and scholars work together under public review to write the content
standards--brief, scrupulously selected lists of what is most worth 
knowing in
each academic subject. These have but one function: to lay before students,
parents, teachers, and the university teachers of teachers the essential 
core
of learning that all students in a modern democracy have the right not to 
be
allowed to avoid. "Core" means what it says: teaching it should take no 
more
than two thirds of the time given to each subject, the rest being left to 
local
school and teacher choice. <p>

This step is the most critical but most often misunderstood. What is a
subject-matter essential, or "standard," and what is not? It is specific, 
not
abstract, but it does not descend to detail. In history a typical standard 
asks
students to understand the causes of the First World War, with an eye to 
the
technological, economic, social, and political forces at work, together 
with
the roles of individuals, of accident, and of ordinary confusion. It does 
not
ask students to "master the concept of conflict in world history." Nor 
does it
ask them to memorize the names of the twenty central characters in the 
tragedy
of the summer of 1914. <p>

As they select each standard, scholars and teachers must consider whether 
they
can explain its importance when students ask "So what?" The First World 
War is
an easy example. What it did to Americans was to shape their lives and 
deaths
for the rest of the twentieth century--from the Depression and the Second 
World
War to the end of the Cold War, from our hubris of 1945 to our present 
fantasy
that we have spent ourselves too poor even to keep our parks clean or our
libraries open. If a standard cannot be explained to the young, or to an
educated public, it is either too general or too detailed. In a hurry, some
states have issued "common cores of learning" that are lists of healthy
attitudes and abstract "learning outcomes." Others have copied detail 
directly
out of the overstuffed national standards documents. Neither is a help to
teachers or curriculum makers.<p>

Step two was never "national" business: writing a state curriculum 
framework,
saying in which grades the essentials should be taught. Its function is to 
end
the plague of gaps and repetitions that only American educators seem 
resigned
to accept as normal. Articulating subject matter across the elementary and
secondary years also requires a collaboration of equals--teachers, 
scholars,
and learning specialists--each of whom has things to say that the others 
need
to hear. The word "framework," too, means what it says; it leaves the third
step--course design and pedagogy --to the school and the teacher. They must
have the authority to make the choices most important to them and to their
students: the topics and questions by which to teach the essentials, the
day-to-day content of instruction, the materials and methods best suited to
their students and to their own strengths.<p>

Step four, writing performance standards and tests of achievement, can 
sensibly
follow only when the others have been taken. But some states are hurrying 
to
award expensive contracts to outside testing firms before anyone has 
thought
about, much less decided, what is worth testing. To leave this to experts 
and
let the rush to "accountability"--which now has a potent assessment lobby
behind it--drive standards and course content will kill all chances for 
school
improvement. Not everything precious can be measured, and not everything
measurable is worth teaching; pap is pap, a drop or a gallon. So once more 
it
is teachers and scholars who must decide what to assess. <p>

Content-based reform will not always be easy even for teachers and 
scholars.
All who teach, from the grades to graduate school, will have to be 
differently
educated than they now are and teach differently than they now teach. For
example, the history learned at any level depends on the prior education of
both student and teacher. And the decision about what history to teach must
anticipate what is to be learned at higher levels. But this is not how 
American
schools and universities work. Teachers and academicians habitually shape 
each
course as an island entire to itself, as though what they teach, or do not
teach, matters to nobody but themselves --as if others had no right to 
notice,
and none to intervene. That must change.<p>

Schoolteachers and university scholars will have to accept each other as
equals, because aligning subject matter demands seamless, collaborative 
work
from pre-school through Ph.D. They rarely do so now. Nor do elementary and 
high
school teachers confer, or teachers in the same building. Apart from ego,
insecurity, and worries over turf, collaboration takes time, which schools 
and
universities rarely provide, and personal commitment, which they rarely 
reward.
Moreover, to choose essentials and to design frameworks and assessments,
educators will have to debate priorities. What <i>is</i> truly most worth
knowing? What must be left out? Academicians avoid such questions at all 
cost;
witness their chaotic college curricula. University faculties will have to
alter their major programs, giving up pet courses for others that better
prepare the next generation of teachers and help those already teaching. 
They
will have to battle colleagues into coherent general-education 
requirements for
underclassmen. To do all this, academicians will need to be broadly 
educated,
and be differently rewarded by administrative and trustee policies.<p>

States whose educators accept this degree of change will accomplish
standards-based reform. Where change is rejected, they will fail. The hard 
fact
is that anchoring school reform in academic learning--and putting teachers 
and
scholars in charge--is foreign in all senses. It would redirect the 
mainstream
of American education as the twentieth-century parade of much-hyped 
fashions
never has. Life Adjustment, "greening," the open classroom, "back to 
basics,"
career education, "futures learning," global consciousness, 
"doing-a-value,"
critical and creative thinking, and "outcomes-based" education (are there 
other
kinds?)--not one of these has ruffled the establishment or gotten beneath 
the
surface to substantial subject matter, and so not one has improved the 
schools
of most American children. Indeed, by leaving weary teachers awash in the
debris from successive tides of obsession and indifference, they have made
things worse.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC5">OBSTACLES
AND 
</a>
<a name="RTFToC6">PROSPECTS</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>O</font>F the obstacles reformers confront, the toughest may 
be our mad
utilitarianism. Consider the three aims of schooling--preparing the 
worker, the
citizen, and the cultivated individual. We put the worker ahead of the 
other
two, as if they had no effect on the nation's economy or the quality of 
work
done. Turning to citizenship, we bypass the substance of history, politics,
letters, and ideas and peddle ready-made attitudes. Thus American educators
have never had to think consistently about the moral, aesthetic, or
intellectual content of public schooling for the masses--the gifts that
academic subjects open for everyone.<p>

Since academics have been for the few, it follows that our teacher corps is
academically undereducated, ill prepared to offer challenging content to 
all
its charges. Teachers are not to blame. Since so little is expected from 
most
students, the university teachers of teachers--whether in content or
pedagogy--see no reason to ask much of <i>them</i>. The time it will take 
to
re-prepare teachers is itself an obstacle. There are no shortcuts to
content-based reform, which makes it vulnerable to hawkers of new fashions 
from
an education industry whose planned obsolescence leaves <i>haute couture 
</i>in
the dust.<p>

States will discover that the changes required by academic school reform 
will
call down showers of objection. "Standards alone will not solve our
problems"--as if anyone thought they could. "Standards will oppress 
minorities
and the poor"--as if the absence of standards does not leave educators 
free to
offer unequal schooling and tax cutters free to slash school spending.
"Standards will stifle innovation"--as though clear and equal standards 
were
not the best friends of innovators. Parents have seen far too many passing 
fads
that skew or empty the curriculum. Settled aims will make it easier to
experiment with school structure, school size, and all the ways that 
schools
have to be different from one another to meet different circumstances.<p>

States will find friends in teachers and citizens who, not overspecialized,
have no ideology to press, and who understand that the three purposes of
education--for work, for citizenship, and for private life--are by their 
nature
distinct, many-sided, requiring different, sometimes opposite, modes of
teaching aimed at different, sometimes opposite, results. Schooling for 
work is
a "conservative" function, demanding disciplined mastery of tasks from the
world of work as it is, not as we wish it to be, and objective testing of
student competence. Schooling for citizenship, in contrast, is a "radical"
activity, egalitarian and skeptical in style, mixing the hard study of 
history
and ideas with free-swinging exchange on public issues. The school nurtures
both teamwork and thorny individualism, at once the readiness to serve and 
the
readiness to resist, for nobody knows ahead of time which the good citizen 
may
have to do. To educate the private person, the school must detach itself 
much
of the time from the clamor of popular culture. It must be conservative in
requiring students to confront the range of arts, letters, and right 
behavior
conceived in the past, toward the liberal end that their choices be 
informed
and thereby free. <p>

People well know that to work at these three purposes, schools must serve 
both
society and the individual, must be close to daily life at some moments and
wholly insulated at others. They know that different things are learned 
best in
different ways, from drill to brainstorming, and that schools have to be
<i>both </i>disciplined and easygoing, hierarchical and egalitarian, at
different times for different subjects at different levels--mixing 
pleasure and
pain, each often following upon the other. <p>

In sum, they can understand why Theodore Sizer is not indulging in paradox 
when
he says that only "a loose system that has rigor" can correct what he 
describes
in <i>Horace's School </i>(1992)as "the inattention of American culture to
serious learning." We need, he says, "generous localism" applied with high 
and
common academic expectations. For a century we have resisted this, 
treating the
majority of our children as though they were learning-disabled. We say that
knowledge is power, but we have kept knowledge from millions of children,
adolescents, and even college students. Our chance to make this 
long-delayed
turn to democratic education is now in the hands of the states and local
schools.

<center><h1> 
Botched 
Standards</h1><p>



<i>Which is more important for young people to study--Magna Carta or the
Mongol empire? The latest answer may surprise you</i><p></center>


<font size=5>T</font>HE world-history document issued by the <a 
href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/nchs/
">National Center for History in the Schools</a>, at UCLA, and funded by 
the U.S. Department of Education and the
National Endowment for the Humanities, is worth a close look, as a 
cautionary
tale for reformers who may assume that scholars see the role of standards 
more
clearly than others do. Given its 314 pages, and the limited time schools 
allot
to world history, it is not helpful even for picking and choosing, because 
it
has no continuing questions to help readers focus on essentials, as better
textbooks do. To avoid the battles among specialists that selection would 
have
set off, its authors, careful to offend no vocal constituency, acted on the
dubious principle that all societies and all eras back to prehistory 
deserve
equal space in the education of young Americans. By so doing they buried
essentials under mounds of undifferentiated matter, much of it academic 
exotica
and antiquarianism.<p>

The document's failure is surprising, because its opening pages are 
eloquent on
why citizens must study history. No reason, it argues, is "more important 
to a
democratic society than this: <i>Knowledge of history is the precondition 
of
political intelligence</i>." It adds, "Without history, a society shares no
common memory of where it has been, what its core values are, or what 
decisions
of the past account for present circumstances." Also in italics is Etienne
Gilson's remark <i>"History is the only laboratory we have in which to 
test the
consequences of thought."</i> But between the promise and the execution we 
find
a chasm. The volume is weakest on thought and the consequences of ideas, on
core values and common memories, not only the West's but any 
civilization's. It
is thin on political turning points and institutions, and thereby on the 
drama
of human choice and its effects. For all its length and pretentious 
demands, it
scants the artistic, literary, and philosophical legacies of world 
cultures,
and it shortchanges the past 250 years, which saw so many of the decisions 
that
"account for present circumstances." <p>

Its treatment of world history has thirty-nine main standards, 108 
subheads,
and 526 sub-subheads, all of them called standards. None of the main 
standards
or subheads is devoted to ideas, whether philosophical, religious, 
ethical, or
moral, social, economic, or political. One must descend to the 526
sub-subheads, or to fragments of them. Neither the Judaic nor the Christian
principles that are the sources of Western values, morals, and views of 
justice
and of ideas of the individual's dignity and responsibility--even for
unreligious or anti-religious thinkers--are given more than one half of a
sub-subhead, less than a thousandth of the document's substance. The ideas 
of
Islam and of Protestant reformers fare no better. However, the topic 
"mastery
of horse-riding on the steppes" gets twice that space, the Scythians and 
the
Xiongnu fill two full sub-subheads, and the Olmecs get a main standard all 
to
themselves. <p>

On the secular side, there is nothing of medieval thought about just rules 
of
law, war, economic life, or social responsibility. Later we find nothing of
Renaissance or Reformation theory concerning society, economics, or 
politics.
Enlightenment thought and its impact on Church and State are relegated to a
single sub-subhead. French revolutionary ideas "on social equality, 
democracy,
human rights, constitutionalism, and nationalism" get one sub-subhead out 
of
ninety-four for the years 1750-1914. For the twentieth century a single
sub-subhead asks students to explain the "leading ideas of liberalism, 
social
reformism, conservatism, and socialism as competing ideologies in 20th 
century
Europe." Leninist and Fascist-Nazi ideologies are each assigned half of a
sub-subhead, so that only two sub-subheads must do for the political ideas 
and
ideology of the entire twentieth-century world. <p>

In squeezing European civilization, the document is also meager on the
political history that makes sophisticated citizens. There is nothing on 
the
failure of Athenian democracy to overcome the forces of pride and 
demagoguery.
The vast questions about Rome's decline that so preoccupied the American
Founders are compressed into part of a subhead, less than half the space 
given
the Gupta empire in India. As to politics in the years 1000-1500, a single
sub-subhead is devoted to "analyzing how European monarchies expanded their
power at the expense of feudal lords and assessing the growth and 
limitations
of representative institutions in these monarchies." So, buried and 
unnamed in
half of that sub-subhead are Magna Carta and the Model Parliament, along 
with
the prime political lesson that true constitutions require a balance of 
power
in society. In the same era entire standards take up the Mongol empire and
sub-Saharan Africa. <p>

The seventeenth-century English Revolution gets a single sub-subhead (out 
of
eighty-four for the era 1450-1770)--no more than "evaluating the interplay 
of
indigenous Indian, Persian, and European influences in Mughal artistic,
architectural, literary, and scientific achievements." The authors find 
nothing
special about English constitutional history that American citizens should
know, in keeping with today's fashion of decrying "Whig history," as 
though the
worldwide struggle for political freedom, and all of its sacrifice, 
setbacks,
and advances, were only a myth to hoodwink the innocent young. All but 
absent,
too, is the history of labor. In the section covering the twentieth century
there is no mention of trade unions, their battles and importance to 
democracy
and social justice, and why totalitarians make them their first victims. 
Even
the vast twentieth-century struggle of liberal democracies to overcome 
Nazism
and Soviet communism fades into pale generalities. <p>

Some of the weaknesses in the world-history document are but the reverse 
side
of American virtues: hopefulness and generosity; our eagerness to embrace
diversity, to be self-critical, to shun "ethnocentrism." In what other 
country
do people cringe at that word and are students required to study other 
cultures
but not their own? The standards also reflect our impatience with 
politics, our
reluctance to admit that only politics can turn aspirations into reality, 
and
our impatience with the gloomier views of human nature that accept the 
presence
of evil in the world, and the tragedy and imperfection of the human 
condition.
<p>

The fact remains, however, that in deference to current styles in the 
history
profession, the authors played down the Western sources of their own 
American
consciences, and failed to do the work of selecting what would best serve 
the
education of American students, or of society at large. Fortunately, their
introduction makes clear why state and local teacher-scholar teams must do
better. Nothing less is at stake than our political competence as a 
people.<p>

Taking the solidity of democratic institutions for granted, educators have
worried too little about the hard things they require citizens to 
understand.
Now, in the mid-1990s, we have reasons to pay more attention. For one 
thing, it
takes a perverse effort of will to deny that the effects of technology and
economics, demography and nature, make our problems and the world's more
complicated than ever. Or to deny that nostrums peddled by the loudest 
voices
in politics and talk TV and radio are more simplistic than ever. Or that
blaming "government" for every ill and anxiety--while not yet so virulent 
as
under the Weimar Republic--betrays a flaming ignorance of history and human
nature. <p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC7">WHAT
HISTORY 
</a>
<a name="RTFToC8">TEACHES</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>W</font>ITH respect to world history, what should Americans 
know and teach? What
is the main story? It is not the parade of military, technological, and
economic "interactions," or the endless comparisons among often 
incomparable
centers of great power, that global studies dwell upon--although these 
must, of
course, be taken into account. The big story is not the push to modernize 
but
the struggle to civilize, to curb the bestial side of human nature. What
students can grasp very well is that this is a common struggle, in which 
all
peoples and races are equal--equal in our natures, equal in the historical
guilt of forebears who pursued war, slavery, and oppression. Black 
Africans,
Anglo-Americans, Europeans, Native Americans, North African and Middle 
Eastern
peoples, Mongols, Chinese, and Japanese--all have pursued these things when
they have had the power to, afflicting one another and weaker neighbors.<p>

For our time, the first lesson to be learned from world history, the most
compelling story, is the age-old struggle of people within each culture to
limit aggression and greed, to nourish the better side of human nature, to
apply morality and law, to keep the peace and render justice. Students can 
see
the glory and agony of this struggle, and how often it has been lost. 
Because
human evil exists, good intent has never been enough. It has taken brains,
courage, self-sacrifice, patience, love, and--always with tragic
consequences--war itself to contain the beast. Against the twin 
temptations of
wishfulness and cynicism, history says that evil and tragedy are real, that
civilization has a high price but that it, too, is real, and has been won 
from
time to time. In history we find the ideas, the conditions, and the famous 
and
ordinary men and women making it possible. <p>

All peoples have taken part in the struggle to civilize. An honest look at 
the
past reveals a common human mixture of altruism, malevolence, and 
indifference,
and reasons for all of us to feel both pride and shame. Starting from any 
other
point of view is historically false, and blind to human nature. 
Historians--and
standard setters--have a special obligation to be candid. But many popular
textbooks are unfailingly pious about other cultures and ultra-critical of 
our
own, preaching a new-style ignorance in reaction against, but just as
pernicious as, our older textbook pieties about ourselves and disdain for
others. Both are pernicious because both sap the will to civilize. People 
who
are taught to feel specially guilty, or specially victimized, or naturally
superior, will not reach out to others as equals; they will not pay the 
costs
in toil, tears, and taxes always imposed by that struggle. <p>

This is not a "conservative" or "liberal" issue but one of trusting 
children,
adolescents, and adults to work with historical truth, however 
inconvenient or
impolite it may seem. History reinforces the rough notion of equality that 
we
learn on the playground and in the street: there are like proportions of
admirable and avoidable people in every imaginable human grouping--by age,
class, race, sex, religion, or cultural taste. Individuals are not equal in
talent or virtue, and certainly not equally deserving of respect. To teach
otherwise is to invite ridicule and resentment. Instead what must 
repeatedly be
taught, because it is not quickly learned--but is quickly forgotten in hard
times--is that in civilized society it is every person's <i>rights</i> 
that are
equally deserving of respect: rights to free expression, equal protection 
under
law, fair judgment, rigorous education, honest work and pay, an equal 
chance to
pursue the good. <p>

This hard truth we accept, and remember, only with the help of historical
insight, which is indispensable in forging a democratic conscience--that 
inner
feeling that we ought to do the right thing even if only out of prudence. 
For
we see again and again that societies failing to accord a good measure of
liberty, equality, and justice have hastened their own decay, particularly 
over
the past two centuries, since the American and French revolutions told the
world that these three were the proper aims of human life and politics, and
that it was right and possible to bring them to reality--by force if 
necessary.
<p>

Student-citizens need to be acutely sensitive to the central political 
drama of
world history since the 1770s--what Sigmund Neumann called the "triple
revolution" aimed at national unity and independence, at political 
democracy
and civil rights, and at economic and social justice. This, too, is not a
liberal or conservative matter. Whether we approve or deplore these ends, 
or
the means to them, does not lessen their force or our need to deal with 
them,
at home and abroad. Modern history tells us that whenever any one of them 
is
frustrated for long, masses of people will sink to envy, self-pity, fury, 
and a
search for scapegoats, f&uuml;hrers, and quick, violent solutions. <p>

Good history is not always fun to learn, any more than is chemistry or
mathematics, and we should not pretend that it is. The job of citizen is no
easier to prepare for than that of doctor or bridge builder. Nor is good
history always popular. It denies us the comforts of optimism or 
pessimism. It
gives the lie to nostalgia, whether for left-wing or right-wing or 
feel-good
politics. Its lessons offer no cure for today's problems, only warnings we 
are
silly to ignore. As they select the essentials of U.S. and world history, 
state
and local standard setters and curriculum makers can look for the 
particulars
that teach such lessons best--memorable events, ideas, and people whose 
stories
need telling, but always in the context of longer narrative history. <p>

For example, an American-history standard should require the ability not 
only
to recall points in the Constitution and Bill of Rights but also to 
understand
the ideas and events behind them, back to Greek and Roman thought and
institutions, to Judeo-Christian views of human nature and responsibility, 
to
<a href="http://www.traveller.com/~hrweb/legal/magnacrt.html">Magna 
Carta</a> and the English Revolution, 
to <a href="gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/98/1
">Hobbes</a>, <a 
href="http://nifty.bookstore.uidaho.edu/Philosophy/Locke,John/Default.htm
">Locke</a>, and Montesquieu,
<a href="gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/55/1
">Burke</a>, <a 
href"http://nifty.bookstore.uidaho.edu/Philosophy/Paine,Thomas/Default.htm">Paine</a>, 
<a href="http://www.mcs.net/~knautzr/fed/fedpaper.html">the 
Federalists</a> and the anti-Federalists. These essentials are
not grasped by playacting a few quarrels from hot Philadelphia afternoons 
of
1787--though playacting can make a good start if the script is based on
original sources.<p>

Moreover, the lesson of the Constitution is not nearly complete without
learning the harrowing consequences of a cheap answer to labor shortages 
that
American planters were sure they had found in the early 1600s--slaves from
Africa. A tortured Constitution, belying the Declaration's promise, was 
only
one, early payment. The Civil War followed, and even 620,000 dead did not
purchase the free and equal Union for which Lincoln prayed in his <a 
href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/inaugural/pres32.html">Second
Inaugural</a>. New chains of bondage were forged, and another century of 
repression
and humiliation followed, before the civil-rights movement of the 1960s
restarted a process of liberation whose grinding slowness continues to 
divide
and embitter us.<p>

Likewise, a world-history standard on the Second World War teaches little
unless that war is seen as a consequence of the outbreak of the First 
World War
and of the murderous incompetence with which it was fought, of the 
Bolshevik
Revolution, of world depression, of the furies and civic ineptitude that
destroyed the Weimar Republic, of Hitler's rise on the shoulders of private
armies, and of the liberal democracies' wishful rejection of the costs of
collective security, from the Paris Conference of 1919 through the Spanish
Civil War to the Nazi occupation of Prague in 1939. Nor can it teach nearly
enough without examining the Holocaust, the ultimate horror, itself a
consequence of all these things and more since the Middle Ages.<p>

The fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War brought back 
the
war's satanic nature, from Rotterdam to Dresden, Nanking and Bataan to
Hiroshima. The debates over guilt revealed widespread avoidance of 
history's
warnings. Some seemed to doubt that evil exists and has to be dealt with, 
even
by making war. Others seemed to deny that any war, launched for whatever 
cause,
will carry frightful human consequences, will be as hellish as weapons 
permit.
And 1945 was not the end. The Cold War followed from the effects of both 
world
wars. Draining lives and resources, fouling our politics, skewing economic
life, it divided us against one another, from the Red scares of the 1940s 
and
1950s through the bloody Korean and Vietnam wars. Its legacy clouds our 
view of
a changing world and its needs, not least our own need to distinguish 
between
force that is necessary and force that is not. All these afflictions are
consequences of human choices back to 1914 and earlier, many of them in 
pursuit
of cheap, quick answers in defiance of history's lessons and the 
imperatives of
civilized life.

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>L</font>EAD is among the most revered
	and the most maligned of elements. Historically its beneficent properties have made it hard to resist, though its virulence is
the stuff of legend. Lead was added to cosmetics and eye salves in predynastic
Egypt, and prescribed as a cure for fever, rash, indigestion, and lust in
ancient Rome. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder cautioned that "all the
current instructions on the subject of [lead's] employment for medicinal
purposes are in my opinion decidedly risky." But his warning went largely
unheeded by the Roman nobility, whose habit of drinking potions sweetened with
"sugar of lead" is said to have hastened the toppling of their empire. <p>
Lead acquired new uses in the industrial age with the mass manufacture of lead
solder, lead pipe, and lead-tinted pigments for glazes and paints. The
mineral's high density made it a natural to be used for bullets and shot, and
its malleability rendered it an ideal material for type--in which context it
came to the attention of Benjamin Franklin. Citing his own "lead colic,"
brought on by frequent encounters with the printing press, Franklin wrote, "The
mischievous Effect from lead is at least above Sixty Years old; and you will
observe with Concern how long a useful truth may be known, and exist, before it
is generally received and practis'd on."<p>
Franklin was right on the mark. Although some of lead's applications waned with
reports of its toxicity (for example, the French banned the manufacture of
leaded white pigments in the mid-1800s for fear of poisoning craftsmen), new
uses for the mineral continued to pop up well into the twentieth century: lead
tubes for toothpaste, lead sheathing for electrical wire, lead shields for
x-ray machines, lead plates for batteries, and lead and more lead in paint
smeared on everything from boat bottoms to baby carriages. By the early 1930s
severe lead poisoning, characterized by convulsions, coma, brain damage, and
death, was recognized as a fairly common disease of childhood. The paint
industry began voluntarily to reduce the amount of lead in its products in the
following decade, but the discovery of tetra-ethyl lead as an anti-knock
additive for gasoline increased lead mining worldwide. Sales of leaded gasoline
rose steadily through the 1960s, with a resulting dispersion into the
environment of millions of tons of lead from car exhaust. Meanwhile, more than
150 clinics were set up nationwide to deal with a steady stream of
lead-poisoning cases. Like the Romans, it seemed, we had entered into a devil's
wager with lead, using the public health as our stake. <p>
All that, of course, has changed. Over the past quarter century Americans not
only have kicked the lead habit but have turned on lead with the zeal of the
betrayed. Congress banned lead-based paint for residential use in 1978, and by
1990 the amount of lead in gasoline had dropped 99.8 percent from mid-1970s
levels. Also in 1990 cans with lead seams, no longer manufactured in this
country, constituted less than one percent of the market; copper or plastic
pipes, not lead ones, were standard in plumbing; lead solder had been banned;
and lead smelters and industries that used lead had been forced to limit their
emissions sharply. Blood-lead levels, measured in micrograms of lead per
deciliter of blood, dropped accordingly. In July of last year the results of
the first phase of the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,
published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, indicated
that average blood-lead levels had plummeted. Pockets of lead poisoning
remained, mostly in the inner city, but generally the numbers were cheering:
the survey concluded that only one half of one percent of children who were
tested had blood-lead levels exceeding the "intervention level" set in 1985 by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <p>
This triumph over lead is widely touted as one of the great public-health
success stories of the century, a stunning example of the strength of activism
over vested interests. But many are unwilling to declare victory. The
Environmental Protection Agency and the <A HREF="http://bio-3.bsd.uchicago.edu/Hhs/Lead/Lead-toxicity.html">Department of Health and Human Services</A>
say that lead poisoning continues to be the No. 1 "environmental disease of
children, affecting at least ten percent of all preschoolers." The CDC calls
lead poisoning the "most common and societally devastating environmental
disease of young children." And an influential Washington lobby, the Alliance
to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, states as "inescapable fact" that
"approximately ten percent of all U.S. preschoolers are lead-poisoned,
eclipsing other environmental health hazards and preventable childhood
diseases." Other groups and the media have picked up the chant, citing
widespread low-level lead poisoning as the trigger for ills ranging from
attention-deficit disorder to juvenile violence. <p>
Despite the impressive roster of medical and scientific organizations
supporting these claims, however, the characterization of lead poisoning as a
"silent epidemic" is not a scientific truth but a rhetorical pose. Symptomatic
lead exposure that causes clear clinical effects of mental or physical
impairment is exceedingly rare. Even moderate blood-lead elevations, at the
CDC's 1985 intervention level, are also quite uncommon. To get to the "one out
of ten preschoolers" figure, regulatory agencies now deem as "poisoned"
children whose lead-to-blood ratios fall between 10 and 25 micrograms per
deciliter --considered within the acceptable range five years ago. (Children in
the early 1960s averaged more than 20 micrograms.) With the stroke of a pen in
<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/i:/cehweb/nceh/pubcatns/1994/cdc/brosures/91lead.htm">1991 the CDC</A> changed "lead poisoning" from a clear diagnosis to a murky
condition, thereby enlarging eighteenfold the likely population at risk and
encouraging the enactment of sweeping anti-lead legislation. Sanford Weiner, a
specialist in risk assessment at the Center for International Studies at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, puts it this way: "The agencies moved
the goalposts."<p>
The CDC justified the new lead threshold by citing "scientific evidence" that
"some adverse effects occur at blood-lead levels at least as low as 10
micrograms per deciliter in children," and adding that this evidence is "so
overwhelming and compelling that it must be a major force in determining how we
approach childhood lead exposure." But the evidence, while provocative, is
hardly conclusive. Lead epidemiology is plagued by inconsistencies, largely
because exposure to lead correlates so neatly with a number of other factors
known to affect children's intelligence and psychological development.
Generally speaking, children of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to
be exposed to lead than are children of higher socioeconomic status, and they
are likely to have higher blood-lead levels. Low socioeconomic status is itself
a risk factor for poor performance on intelligence and developmental tests.
Therefore it's not clear whether lead is causing deficits or simply acting as a
marker for other factors known to affect performance. In a commentary in the
March, 1993, issue of the <i>Physicians for Social Responsibility
Quarterly</i>, the developmental psychologist Sandra Scarr, the Commonwealth
Professor of Psychology at the University of Virginia, wrote, "The child's
heredity and environment are correlated with lead exposure such that it is
extremely difficult, if not theoretically impossible, to disentangle the
effects of the child's broader biology and ecology from lead exposure." Studies
that have attempted to separate out the factors are, usually by their own
authors' admission, imperfect. A review of the scientific literature on lead
published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> last year concluded, <p>
<blockquote>

Uncertainty remains as to the real impact that lead makes on
children's neuropsychological development. In the face of this doubt, the priority that
should be devoted to detection and intervention on children with moderately
increased blood lead, compared with other social influences on childhood
development, is open to debate. <p>
</blockquote>
The Australian scientist Peter Baghurst, one of the authors of that paper,
contributed to another study cited by the CDC and other experts as providing
proof for the theory that low-level lead is dangerous. One of Baghurst's
co-authors on the former paper, the psychologist Marjorie Smith, who is the
acting director of the Thomas Coram Research Unit at the Institute of Education
at London University, says that comments such as those made by the CDC are
typical of the tendency to exaggerate the impact of low-level lead exposure.<p>
"We looked at more than twenty-six epidemiological studies conducted since
1979, and found that the effect of lead at low levels on IQ was consistently
the smallest of any of the factors that have been studied," Smith says.
Low-level blood lead was linked to slight deficits in some psychometric
measures, but these effects were so small (about one IQ point, on average) that
it was impossible to determine what caused them, or if they had any real
significance. In any case, the effect of lead was swamped by every other
variable. For example, birth order and parental education had several times the
impact on IQ of low-level blood lead, as did the amount of parental
attention.<p>
"What could be concluded was that parents should worry less about low-level
blood lead and more about reading their children bedtime stories," Smith says.
"But the approach here in Europe has consistently been more measured and much
less reactive than it's been in the United States." <p><pre>

</pre>
 <font size=5>A</font>CTUALLY, no scientific consensus	on the issue exists
 even in the United States. Abraham Wolf, an assistant professor of psychology at Case Western
Reserve School of Medicine, has studied the effects of low-level lead exposure.
"There is no question that lead at high levels is dangerous," he says. "But the
scientific literature does not support the claim that a child will be retarded
in any way by low levels." And Birt Harvey, the chairman of the Department of
Pediatrics at Stanford University, wrote in the February, 1994, issue of the
journal <i>Pediatrics</i> that "for children with blood-lead levels between ten
and twenty micrograms, evidence is lacking of a clinically significant effect
of recommended interventions to reduce blood lead or of an effect if blood lead
is reduced." Harvey's criticism was aimed specifically at CDC recommendations
calling for universal lead screening of young children. According to the
recommendations, children should be screened unless it is shown that the
neighborhood they live in does not have a lead-poisoning problem. Harvey
pointed out that the only way to prove that a neighborhood has no lead problem
is to screen the children who live in it. This Catch-22 means that essentially
all children must be screened, sometimes repeatedly, regardless of where they
live. <p>
One of the few nationally known studies of lead screening to have been done was
published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> in 1993. It
found only six of 5,115 poor children screened in Orange County, California, to
have blood-lead levels above 25 micrograms. Of these, two had been exposed to
lead from Mexican folk remedies. The cost of uncovering these cases was
estimated to be more than $19,000 each. Another study, of suburban children
living outside St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Chicago, found that about one tenth
of one percent of children screened had blood-lead levels higher than 20
micrograms. Suburban children do get elevated levels, but this is generally the
consequence of a discrete event, such as a home renovation that disturbs intact
lead paint, or the illegal use of lead solder in a water pipe. These are clear
hazards, but they result in hundreds, not millions, of poisonings. In general,
lead poisoning is closely related to poverty. Joel Schwartz, an associate
professor of environmental epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health
and a CDC adviser on lead, explains why this fact is so often obscured by
anti-lead lobbyists.<p>
"If you say lead is a problem of poor minority kids, then the rest of society
will say, 'The heck with them,'" Schwartz says. "That's why people push
universal screening. But if you look at the cost-benefit, and where exposure is
likely to take place, you have to target screening. Black children have double
the risk of elevated blood-lead levels that white children of similar
socioeconomic level have, so race has to be a consideration in the screening
process whether it's politically correct or not." <p>
Edgar J. Schoen, the medical director of regional perinatal screening for the
Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Oakland, California, is a longtime
critic of universal screening. "Screening all infants and toddlers for lead is
a terribly wasteful proposal," he says. "The way to address the pockets of lead
poisoning that still occur is not by performing tests on as many as sixteen
million children a year, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars."<p>
Herbert Needleman, formerly the chairman of the board of the Alliance to End
Childhood Lead Poisoning, and a professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the
University of Pittsburgh, says that such assertions are "uninformed." "Many in
the American Academy of Pediatrics do not think lead poisoning is a problem,"
he says. "They've balked at universal screening because it alarms parents and
the prevalence is low. But to back off now would be to lose momentum to wipe
the disease out--something we could do in ten to twenty years if we keep at
it."<p>
Needleman is perhaps the government's top scientific adviser on lead. A study
he published in 1979, which concluded that children who had higher lead
residues in their teeth performed less well than other children on IQ and
developmental tests, is referred to in virtually every analysis of the lead
issue, including the 1991 CDC recommendations. His more recent work, showing
that very low blood-lead levels at age two are powerfully associated with
intelligence and well-being later in life, helped to bring about the country's
increasingly stringent lead policy. (Needleman's co-author David Bellinger, a
psychologist at Harvard Medical School, says that a subsequent study showed
about a six-point IQ deficit at age ten for every 10 micrograms per deciliter
at age two.) Such findings have prompted Needleman to call for removal of lead
paint from the nation's housing stock. <p>
"We need to start by carefully deleading all houses with lead paint that's
peeling, which would cost about thirty billion dollars," Needleman says. "We
then need to continue to get the lead out of remaining structures, because all
paint peels eventually."<p>
But although he is lauded for his crusade by policymakers, journalists, and
child advocates, Needleman has come under heavy fire from scientists. In 1983
an EPA expert committee criticized Needleman's 1979 paper for faulty methods
and improper conclusions. In 1992 a committee of his colleagues at the
University of Pittsburgh found him guilty of deliberately misrepresenting
procedures used in the same study. The Pittsburgh panel suggested that
Needleman misrepresented his methods so that his study "would appear to be a
more adequate basis for public policy regarding environmental controls for
lead." Needleman has disputed the charge of deliberate misrepresentation and is
seeking in a lawsuit to have it withdrawn.<p>
Needleman's impact on lead policy has in any event been enormous. In 1992,
owing largely to the influence of his work and the lobbying efforts of the
alliance, Congress passed the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction
Act, or "Title X," a law whose central purpose is to "mobilize national
resources to support expanded prevention efforts on a broad scale"--that is, to
rally financial support for the widespread removal of lead paint. <p>
Title X charges the EPA with developing regulations governing lead-paint
abatement and authorizes the states to administer and enforce them. It also
stipulates that starting next year owners of homes built before 1978 must alert
potential buyers or renters to the presence of lead paint, and if lead is
present provide them with a lead-hazard information pamphlet. Real-estate
agents must also come forward with this information, and if they fail to do so
will be liable for both civil and criminal penalties. Advocates predict that
enforcement of Title X will harness market forces to put pressure on landlords
and homeowners to make their buildings "lead-safe" before attempting
real-estate transactions. According to a report prepared by the alliance and
the Conservation Law Foundation, "Ultimately, market mechanisms will ensure
that properties that are not lead-safe are valued less by purchasers and
appraisers than properties that are lead-safe." But since homeowners who know
they have lead hazards will be required by law to reveal them, and those who
don't know will not be required to find out, some argue that the new law will
have, if anything, a chilling effect.<p>
"How many people are going to spend two or three hundred dollars to get their
homes tested just so that they can tell a prospective buyer that they have lead
hazards?" says Joshua Cohen, an environmental consultant in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, who specialized in lead research when he was a fellow at the
Harvard Center for Risk Analysis. "My guess is, if anything, the law will be a
disincentive to test for lead."<p>
Approximately 65 percent of all residences in this country, including 60.8
million privately owned houses and apartments, contain lead paint, and,
according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the cost of
removing all of it would run to the hundreds of billions of dollars. But the
alliance doesn't really expect the owners of private homes to delead their
property. "We're focusing on rental units where the other force at play here is
the tort system," says the executive director of the alliance, Don Ryan. The
idea is that renters will sue landlords who fail to comply with the lead
laws--and they will. In Massachusetts, where the lead law is arguably the
toughest in the country, landlords who do not control lead hazards are liable
for the threat of elevated blood-lead levels in their tenants under age six.
Robert Rainer, a personal-injury attorney in Boston, explains that
Massachusetts families with young children are entitled to compensation merely
for living in a rented apartment that contains lead paint. Last year Rainer won
a settlement for a family on the grounds that their apartment contained illegal
lead paint. The family included one child under the age of six, whose
blood-lead level was zero. "An apartment with lead paint in violation of the
Massachusetts lead statute is, by law, not inhabitable by young children,"
Rainer says. "The question of whether any children are damaged by the paint is
an entirely separate issue." An article in the May, 1994, issue of <i>National
Underwriter</i>, a trade publication for the insurance industry, reported that
"the incidence of lead liability claims is exploding." <p>
In Massachusetts--and in Maryland, where lead laws are also tough--fear of
litigation has led to a sharp increase in discrimination by landlords against
families with children and to the abandonment of housing stock in the inner
city, where the cost of lead abatement is often not justified by the rental
value of the property. Stephanie Pollack, an attorney with the Conservation Law
Foundation who is also a consultant for the board of directors of the alliance
and serves on the national CDC lead committee, says that the law is a
"double-edged sword" that, despite its drawbacks, has been effective in
eliminating lead-paint hazards. Pollack drafted the Lead Poisoning Prevention
Act, a model law currently under consideration by advocates and legislators in
several states. The act requires child-care centers and some landlords to
obtain certificates of lead-safe status from qualified lead inspectors. "The
law is working here--it's having a tremendous effect on rental housing stock,"
Pollack says. "In places where no one is suing, landlords are doing nothing."
<p>
But it's not just landlords who are doing nothing; only a tiny proportion of
private homeowners have deleaded their property, and in Massachusetts a very
small number have deleaded, though until last year homeowners were under a
state mandate to do so. Joshua Cohen says that their reluctance to delead is an
indication that most people do not consider lead abatement a high priority--at
least not when they're the ones paying for it. "Either all these people are
ignorant or they've decided it's simply not worth it," he says. "I would assert
the latter is the case."<p>
Indeed, Don Ryan lives with his wife and two small children in a 1953
center-entrance colonial that has not been deleaded. Ryan sees no irony in
this. The paint in his house isn't hazardous, he says, because it is not
peeling or cracking, and therefore will not flake onto the floor and wind up in
his children's mouths. Rental units, he says, are more likely to have what he
calls "lead-based-paint hazards." <p>
But determining exactly what constitutes a hazard is a subjective business. The
Lead Poisoning Prevention Act defines a lead-based-paint hazard as "any
condition that causes exposure to lead from lead-contaminated dust,
lead-contaminated soil, lead-based paint that is deteriorated or present in
accessible surfaces, friction surfaces, or impact surfaces that would result in
adverse human health effects as established by the Department." This definition
is broad, and can be interpreted in any number of ways. Philip Berns, who was a
fellow in the Lead Poisoning Prevention Project of Bronx Legal Services, says
that in the New York City housing code any deterioration of paint constitutes a
violation--even a thumbtack hole. Tenants have a right to demand that
pre-existing hazards be repaired, and the landlord may be liable for damages if
they are not.<p>
"The idea is that these violations are supposed to be fixed properly, but there
is no supervision," Berns says. So, to avoid getting cited or sued, landlords
might cover small cracks with plaster or putty and sand the walls, thereby
releasing lead-paint dust and contaminating the entire room. <p>
Ryan says that the alliance is not demanding total lead abatement, but
"Understanding Title X," an alliance publication, describes the reduction of
lead hazards as an "interim measure" and implies that the removal of lead paint
should be the nation's ultimate goal. Ellen Silbergeld, a toxicologist at the
University of Maryland, the chair of the EPA's National Policy Committee on
Lead, and a board member of the alliance, says that although the removal of
lead paint may in some instances seem impractical, it can be necessary at times
to solve the problem. "Because lead poisoning is so poorly reversed by
treatment and because it is so serious, we have to think about primary
prevention," she says. Silbergeld's proposal to tax lead by the pound to pay
for national abatement efforts left the lead industry fuming and the
lead-abatement industry cheering. Olin Jennings, a management consultant in
Columbia, New Jersey, who specializes in the lead-abatement industry, predicts
that its market will grow rapidly, propelled by Title X and resulting
litigation. In a 1991 business analysis he reported that the total potential
market for contracting and testing services would hover at $600 billion. But
Jennings went on to warn that <p>
<blockquote>
Asbestos abatement contractors and consultants have been entering the market as
an "easy" diversification out of the troubled asbestos market. Intense
competition from unqualified and untrained painting and interior remodeling
contractors is also expected. . . . Most home owners will not be able to
distinguish one consultant or contractor from another and are expected to
purchase on price. <p>
</blockquote>
Indeed, studies have pointed to lead-paint abatement as a major <i>cause</i> of
lead poisoning. In a study published in the November, 1991, issue of
<i>Pediatrics</i>, Yona Amitai, a physician who was then in the division of
pharmacology and toxicology at the Children's Hospital Medical Center in
Boston, reported that "deleading resulted in a significant, albeit transient,
increase in blood lead levels." Children in the study averaged 36.4 micrograms
per deciliter before deleading took place, and 42.1 micrograms while deleading
took place. Blood-lead levels increased as much as 200 percent during
deleading, with the result that forty-two of the 114 children had to be
chelated--that is, had to have lead chemically flushed from their blood.<p>
Mark Farfel, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public
Health and the director of the lead-abatement program at the Kennedy Krieger
Institute, says that improperly done lead-paint abatement can force tenfold to
hundredfold transient increases in lead-dust levels and a subsequent spike in
blood-lead levels. "According to Maryland state law, if owners control lead
hazards in their houses they get limited liability in court," he says.
"However, the package of [abatement] procedures recommended by the state has
not yet been proven effective scientifically." Farfel is currently doing a
study to see what effect, if any, various levels of abatement will have on
children's blood-lead levels. Meanwhile, despite rhetoric to the contrary,
there is little evidence that the removal of lead paint will significantly
reduce the incidence of lead poisoning in children. Some experts argue that in
fact lead-paint abatement is not even the most important step to take to
continue solving the nation's problem, and that its pursuit supports the
ideological goal of a "lead-free America" more than it promotes public
health.<p><pre>

</pre>
<font size=5>I</font>T is not lead paint per se but lead dust that causes the
bulk of lead exposure in human beings. Some children gnaw on porch rails and windowsills, swallowing
paint chips as they chew, but most kids get their lead from the steady
ingestion of leaded dust carried on their fingers and hands. Lead gets into
dust not only from interior paint but also from deteriorating exterior paint
and from soil polluted with decades of leaded-gasoline emissions. Removing
interior lead paint does nothing to prevent lead exposure from either of these
other sources.<p>
Howard Mielke, an environmental toxicologist at the College of Pharmacy at
Xavier University of Louisiana, in New Orleans, and an expert on <A HREF="http://atsdr1.atsdr.cdc.gov:8080/cxlead.html">lead in soils</A>,
says that the importance of lead in exterior dust is consistently underrated by
federal agencies. Mielke has found that children's blood-lead levels correlate
neatly with lead levels in soil near their homes, which in turn correspond with
past traffic patterns. The lead that has accumulated in soil is picked up
during outdoor play and tracked into the house, where it becomes part of the
house dust. This, Mielke says, solves the little-publicized mystery of why so
many inner-city children have high blood-lead levels even though their homes
contain no lead-paint hazards. <p>
"In 1970, when many cars were getting just ten miles to a gallon in stop-and-go
traffic, a busy intersection might have gotten as much as four or five tons of
lead dumped on it in a year," he says. "That's roughly equal to having a lead
smelter at every major intersection in the United States. As a result, there is
a very, very large reservoir of lead in soil."<p>
Mielke's laboratory at Xavier is equipped with a "clean room"--a glassed-in
area, like a greenhouse, fitted with air filters. Without the filters, Mielke
says, the ambient air would contaminate his tissue and water samples with lead.
Mielke points out that lead in and of itself is not a threat to human
health--84 percent of lead used in this country goes into batteries, which are
not a source of lead exposure unless they are burned in an incinerator. The
problem for people is "bioavailable" lead, lead that can get into the blood.
Lead paint is not bioavailable until it deteriorates into small particles, or
is ground into a fine powder by sanding, burning, or scraping, the very
processes by which much lead-paint abatement takes place. <p>
Mielke took me for a walk around his neighborhood in New Orleans, a
semi-gentrified mixture of tumbledown bungalows and antebellum grand houses. We
were scouting for paint dust, and it took us all of three minutes to find a man
sanding paint off the windowsills of a house old enough to be his
great-grandfather's --and old enough to contain a good amount of lead paint.
The man was wearing a pair of baggy shorts and a bandanna, hardly the uniform
recommended by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for working
with lead paint. When I asked him if he had thought of using a respirator, he
shrugged, smiled, and then offered to paint my house later that week. As we
stood and watched, particles of paint floated down from the window like
dandruff. Mielke grimaced. "It's against the law to sand leaded paint in New
Orleans," he said. "But what city has the means to enforce a law like that?"<p>
Unlike lead in paint, lead from gasoline emissions is almost entirely
bioavailable, from the moment it leaves the engine. It becomes part of an
aerosol that floats in the air until it hits a surface, such as a tree or a
building; then it gradually sinks or gets washed to the ground. This explains
why soil-lead levels are sometimes very high near the foundations of buildings
in big cities--even the foundations of brick buildings that contain no lead
paint. Crumbling exterior lead paint adds to lead buildup in soil. Several
studies here and in England have shown that children get large amounts of lead
dust on their hands from outside their homes, and research also points to lead
in soil as a significant contributor to blood lead. An EPA study found that the
removal of lead-contaminated soil significantly reduced the average blood-lead
levels of children in Boston. Full results of the study have not yet been
published, but the data were re-analyzed by Allan Marcus, a statistician with
the EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment, who says, "It's clear
that in places where there are high soil-lead levels outside, most of the lead
in dust inside a house comes from the soil. Surface soil is easily scuffed off
and turned into surface particles, which are dragged in by shoes, or household
pets. In fact, there is a statistical relationship between the number of pets
in a household and blood-lead levels."<p>
Brian Davies, a researcher at the University of Bradford, in England, found
that in high-traffic areas--particularly in the summer, when windows are left
open--large amounts of lead dust blown in from outside accumulate on
windowsills in houses that contain no lead paint. Many children's blood lead
doubles in the summer even though, presumably, they spend more time outside
than they do in other seasons, away from lead-painted walls and windowsills.
Many scientists believe that lead must be getting into children's blood from
sources other than interior paint. While conceding this point, Don Ryan, of the
Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, says that his organization tries to
focus on what it sees as its central mission--getting rid of interior
lead-paint hazards. Getting lead out of soil, he says, is unrealistic. <p>
"It costs a fortune to remediate lead-contaminated soil," Ryan says, "so lead
in soil is being used by some property owners and real-estate interests as an
excuse not to deal with lead in paint at typically high interior levels. We are
guarded against the EPA's setting a soil standard that distracts from
lead-based-paint housing hazards." <p>
Mielke counters that reducing exterior lead hazards does not necessarily mean
removing soil; it can involve measures as simple as covering bare ground with
grass or pavement, or installing a sandbox to keep kids from mucking in the
dirt. Installing mats to catch soil from shoes at the door is also a proven
method of reducing lead exposure in children, as is making sure that they wash
their hands frequently. "We live in an environment filled with lead; there's no
going back on that," Mielke says. "We can't get rid of it, so we're going to
have to learn to live with it." He says that the major cities of Japan used to
have very high levels of lead in their dust from leaded gasoline but that
Japanese children's blood-lead levels stayed low, because of strict hygienic
practices. "No one would think of wearing shoes in a home in Japan," he says.
"And every McDonald's has a washbasin close to the entrance that the kids
actually use to wash their hands. The Japanese have learned to live in a
polluted world."<p>
Sandboxes, doormats, and hand washing might well help reduce lead exposure in
many children, but such measures are rarely mentioned by health agencies and
advocacy groups. The attractiveness of lead as an advocacy issue is clear--the
culprit is well defined, and the costs seem easy to pass along to "bad guy"
landlords and industry. But the buck doesn't stop with the bad guys. Pressured
by fear of litigation, many landlords are likely to delead units whether or not
they are truly hazardous, and to pass the cost and risks of the lead abatement
on to renters, the group least able to afford them. The real-estate publication
<i>Banker &amp; Tradesman</i> reported in January of last year that this is
already happening in Massachusetts, where "rent premiums far exceed the
amortized cost of deleading a unit." <p>
Ultimately, protecting children against lead may involve both less and more
than is currently being recommended by lobbying organizations and mandated by
the federal agencies they influence. Regardless of how much lead is in a
child's environment, it does no harm until it enters the child. Today lead is
not entering most children at a rate that scientists can agree is dangerous.
Nevertheless, thousands of mostly inner-city children are exposed to lead in
dwellings that are in dire need of rehabilitation not only to get rid of lead
but to take care of a variety of health hazards, from windows without locks to
leaky gas heaters to rat infestation. These homes should be targeted and the
children who live in them temporarily relocated while deteriorated paint is
professionally removed and the homes are professionally cleaned. But stripping
intact lead paint from woodwork should not take priority over patching a
leaking roof or fixing a heating system that belches carbon monoxide. Nor
should millions be spent on screening children who are at very low risk of lead
exposure. Escalating low-level lead exposure into a nationwide "epidemic" has
done little to help those children who really are at risk. Only by treating
lead poisoning for what it is--largely a disease of the poor--do we stand a
chance of beating it. <p>

<A HREF="#Wen"><b>Wen Stephenson</b>:</A> In the introduction to your new book, <I>Bebop and 
Nothingness</I>, you acknowledge the pun in the title on Jean-Paul 
Sartre's <I>Being and Nothingness</I>. You caution against taking it too 
literally, but it's an intriguing title, and to someone who listens to and 
cares about the future of jazz, it might even be a little disturbing. 
What's behind the title? <P>

<img src="./jazzart/Davis.gif" width=175 height=179 border=0 vspace=5 
hspace=10 align=right alt="Francis Davis">

<A HREF="#Francis"><B>Francis Davis</B>:</A> In the chapter on Art Pepper 
and Charlie Parker I talk about novels such as Chandler Brossard's <I>Who 
Walk in Darkness</I>, and John Clellon Holmes's <I>Go!</I>, in which the 
characters tend to be fallen intellectuals, American post-war 
existentialists.  They're always going to parties where bop, which was then 
a very new music, is playing in the background.  I make a joke about how 
these novels ought to be called <I>Bebop and Nothingness</I>.  But I think 
beyond the joke there is also something about the role jazz once played in 
intellectual life that it no longer does.<P>


<B>WS</B>:  By most accounts jazz is flourishing in the '90s. And yet, 
taken together, your current article and the introduction to <I>Bebop and 
Nothingness</I> read like a jeremiad on contemporary jazz -- you seem to 
say there's something hollow about the contemporary scene, that things 
just aren't like they used to be.<P>

<B>FD</B>: In this case, you have people pretending that it <I>is</I> the 
way it used to be, that we're once again in a vital period like the 1950s 
or the early 1960s, which I certainly don't think is true.  A necessary 
distinction -- not just with jazz but with any art form -- is that a period of 
great popularity isn't necessarily a period of great innovation.  It's one 
of the contradictions of modern, corporate, 
technological society.  Major labels at this point happen to be taking an 
interest in jazz, and they haven't always.<P>

<B>WS</B>:  If you were to pinpoint what's at the root of your 
disenchantment with contemporary jazz, would it be the jazz 
<I>business</I>? Or is it more the players themselves? Or the audience 
maybe?<P>

<B>FD</B>:  Oh . . . it's a combination of all those things. I think my 
problems with the audience might have something to do with my own sense of 
alienation.  If I go to a concert and I'm supposed to be reviewing it, and 
I'm taking notes, I sometimes wind up jotting down as much about the audience 
as I do about the performers. I enjoy sitting toward the 
back where I can see not only the stage or the bandstand, but also the 
other people there. It's an interesting proposition: What does music 
mean to people? What does it signify to them? I remember 
seeing Joshua Redman a few years ago. It was a really good set and I 
enjoyed it, but it seemed to me that the audience there in the club -- 
which happened to lean toward middle-age and was predominantly white -- 
was feeling validated somehow by a young black player on stage playing 
this music that most of the guys there probably listened to in college 
thirty years ago.  It's reassuring to people to think, "Oh, kids are still 
playing it."  <P>

And you know, the jazz business . . . I 
suppose the jazz business is a necessary evil.<P>

<B>WS</B>:  Has it changed in the last few years in a way that is not 
positive?  How is the corporate jazz establishment different now than it 
was in previous eras?<P>

<B>FD</B>: Well, I think major labels have found a way to market jazz, a 
way to pitch it to an audience.  The price that's paid is that certain 
kinds of music are marginalized.  
And it's not just avant-garde jazz.  Contemporary players who are playing 
in a pre-bop style get marginalized too.  Recently, here in Philadelphia, 
I saw a wonderful concert with the cornetist Warren Vach&eacute; and the 
guitarist Howard Alden playing duets at an art museum.  It was part of an 
ongoing festival, and it was billed as "Jazz of the 20s and 30s," or 
something like that.  It was a wonderful concert, and I thought, If you say 
you are interested in jazz, how can you not be interested in these players?  
These are not far-out players; it's just that <I>bebop</I> has become 
synonymous with <I>jazz</I>.  <P>

<B>WS</B>: Is that how you would explain the popularity of some of the 
middle-aged or older musicians today who've had considerable commercial 
success, such as the saxophonists Joe Lovano and Joe Henderson? Do you 
chalk it up to the fact that bebop is the accepted, marketable style right 
now?<P>

<B>FD</B>: Both Joe Lovano and Joe Henderson veer a little bit left of 
conventional bebop.  But I think it's revealing that Henderson, Lovano -- 
Abbey Lincoln, the singer, would be another example -- have become popular 
because they're on major labels now.  In the case of Joe Henderson, it's 
not like he disappeared and suddenly resurfaced in 1992, when Verve brought 
out that record of him doing Billy Strayhorn.  He had records coming out 
all the time, generally not on easy-to-find labels, sometimes on European 
labels.  I'm glad Henderson, Lovano, and Lincoln have found a larger
audience.  But it's because they have the push behind them.  It makes you 
think of all the musicians who don't have the push behind them, who are 
just as good.<P>

<B>WS:</B> Who are some of the young musicians today who don't fit into 
the desired mold?<P>

<B>FD</B>: There's a trumpet player named Dave Douglas -- I think he's in 
his early thirties -- whose work I really like.  It may be unfair to call 
him the most <I>promising</I> musician to emerge in the last five to six 
years, because he's already quite accomplished as an instrumentalist, as a 
soloist, and as a composer.  He's not on a major label.  He's the same age 
as a lot of the people I'm writing about in the new piece, but his music 
doesn't fit the mold in the same way that theirs does.  But it's very 
inventive, very individualistic stuff.  It has a real body-warmth to it.  
He's someone to watch.  There are others, too, but Dave Douglas is the one 
that really stands out. <P>

<B>WS</B>:  Let me ask you about the term "bebop."  I notice you refer to 
<I>conventional</I> bebop. I assume that when we talk about people playing 
bebop these days we don't mean they're playing the same kind of music that 
was being played in the mid- to late-1940s, but that it's a post-bop 
music, influenced by bebop and carrying forward the innovations that bebop 
brought.  Is that what you mean?<P>

<B>FD</B>:  Exactly.  In fact, most of the music that you hear now, if you 
were to relate it to a style of jazz of the past, would probably have more 
in common with hard bop.<P>

<B>WS</B>:  What period do you place hard bop?<P>

<B>FD</B>:  Generally it's placed in the mid- to late-1950s.  <P>

If you go back and listen to early bop, or early hard bop -- if you listen 
to Charlie Parker's early stuff, and 
Gillespie's early stuff, or you listen to the stuff Horace Silver did from 
around 1954 onward, which was the foundation of hard bop, or Clifford Brown 
and Max Roach, and so on -- you hear an edge in that music.  That music 
sounds positively .  .  .  oh .  .  .  almost <I>futuristic</I> even now.  
It's all sharp angles.  What can I tell you?  The edges have been rounded 
off.  <P>

It's funny, sometimes it takes an older performer who was around when that 
music was new to make you realize how daring and experimental it
was. Last week I heard a fantastic set by the alto saxophonist Frank 
Morgan. If I named the tunes he played you'd think, "Oh my God, it's such 
generic jazz."  He played "Walkin'," the Miles Davis thing; he played "A 
Night in Tunisia"; "Hot House," which is Tadd Dameron's line, based on 
"What Is This Thing Called Love?" Things like that, but he was approaching 
the material with such fury and with such an edge that you could hear the
difference.  Sometimes, when you listen to those early bop records, like 
the early Savoys, you realize that was a young man's music, that was a 
hell-bent music. And now you have young men playing it who sound like 
premature old men.  It's startling sometimes  to hear somebody from that 
first generation play it when you're used to the people who came after 
them.<P>

<B>WS</B>: You mentioned Charlie Parker, in the title piece of <I>Bebop 
and Nothingness<B> </B></I>you say that listening to Parker "changes the 
way one hears what came before him and what came after him."  There seems 
to be a tension between mastery of traditional forms (or what are now 
traditional forms) and the kind of rule-breaking that Parker had to do in 
order to be truly innovative. Is there a tension today between tradition 
and innovation? Or is it more between conformity and individuality?<P>

<B>FD</B>: I think that's it exactly.  It is a tension between conformity 
and individuality.  But it's a very thin line.  I don't think Charlie 
Parker, for example, thought, "I'm going to sound like nobody who came 
before me.  I'm going to change the shape of jazz." It doesn't work quite 
that way.  Nor did Ornette Coleman think 
that way -- he just happened to play the way he played.  <P>

But here's where the tension occurs between tradition and innovation: in 
Charlie Parker's time nobody thought that much about tradition.  Jazz music 
itself wasn't that old.  History wasn't yet a burden in jazz the way it is 
now.  I think this is something that race complicates too, because you have 
a group of people in America whose past was erased -- whose past was denied 
them.  It's important for them to invent a tradition.  But tradition can be 
used as a bludgeon against innovation.  There have always been conformist 
pressures in jazz, but this is especially true now.  And with record 
companies entering the picture and promoting only certain kinds of jazz -- 
well, you know, this becomes even more of an inhibiting factor.<P>

<B>WS</B>:  You have to wonder, though, at this point in jazz history -- 
with everything that has been done already -- how you'd feel as a young 
jazz musician. Where else is there to go if not back into the tradition, 
to riff on the tradition, so to speak?<P>

<B>FD</B>:  Oh sure, but if you are going to go back to tradition, why 
limit it to bebop? There's plenty of stuff before bebop. There's great 
music by Jelly Roll Morton that's virtually unexplored by modern players.  
And the tradition also includes everything that happened after bop; it 
includes Ornette Coleman and everything that's happened since. 
There needs to be a sense of tradition as an ongoing thing. <P>

In fact, I think the person who is indirectly responsible for this emphasis 
on tradition, and he meant something quite else by it, was the critic 
Martin Williams, who published a book called <I>The</I> <I>Jazz 
Tradition</I> years ago.  Williams, when he started writing in the 1950's, 
became a champion of two musicians in particular.  The first was Jelly Roll 
Morton, whom Williams -- rightly so -- considered the first important jazz 
composer.  The other was Ornette Coleman, who had just arrived on the scene 
in 1959 when Williams became his champion.  So you had somebody arguing 
that the very earliest kind of jazz and the very latest were part of a 
continuum.  It was a radical concept.  But it's no longer a radical 
concept; it's a very conservative concept.<P>

<B>WS</B>:  Are you nostalgic for a time when there was a clear 
avant-garde in jazz?  <P>

<B>FD</B>:  In some ways, yeah, inevitably I am. It has something to do 
with when I started to listen, around 1964 or 1965.  The big news was what 
Coltrane was doing; the big news was Albert Ayler exploding on the scene. 
The rules were being broken and redefined every week it seemed. So I'm 
probably nostalgic for that in the same way that somebody who started to 
listen twenty years earlier would be nostalgic for a period when people 
danced to jazz music.  In the piece I did on the tenor saxophonist Charles 
Gayle, who's a sort of underground free-jazz hero -- and whose music I 
happen to like very much -- I have gentle fun (shall we say) with some of 
his followers.  They strike me as people who are <I>really</I> nostalgic 
for that period, and don't want to hear anything that isn't screaming 
shake-the-floor-of-heaven kind of jazz. If they hear something with a little bit 
of form, they think, "He's selling out."  I'm not nostalgic in 
that way.  But this is something I've been thinking about a lot. <P>

<B>WS:</B> Is there a jazz establishment now that precludes there being a 
vital avant-garde?<P>

<B>FD:</B> There's a point that I make in "Like Young" about some of the 
resentment toward Wynton Marsalis on the part of critics, coming as a 
result of Wynton's having usurped their authority to some extent.  Wynton is, 
among other things, the most important jazz critic in America.  He doesn't 
review records or concerts -- but he makes pronouncements and gives 
interviews that are read by far more people than would read my reviews or 
Stanley Crouch's pieces. In a way, it's the role of the critic to be the 
conservative, to point to what's new and say, "Yes, yes, but it's been 
done before . . . it hasn't been tested yet . . . these are our standards 
from years back."  And it's the role of musicians to forget about all that 
and just plow ahead and make breakthroughs.  But it's just the 
opposite now.  The critics are the ones who really want 
something new to happen, and it's the musicians who are saying "No, no, 
no, we must adhere to tradition."  It's an interesting turnabout and I'm 
not quite sure what it means.<P>

Another way in which jazz is the opposite of the rest of the world: if you 
want to talk about inclusion, in the rest of the world, in academia, 
inclusion means bringing into the canon people who have been excluded from 
it, whether they be black, or Asian-American, or women writers, gay 
writers, and so on. In jazz, inclusion should mean acknowledging the 
contributions of white musicians and European musicians. <P>

<B>WS</B>:  What about the image of the white jazz musician as a kind of 
usurper -- taking the black, African-American tradition and appropriating 
it in a colonialistic or imperialistic way?<P>

<B>FD</B>:  The white musician traditionally has had a much greater chance 
of attaining popularity, because there is some element in which an 
audience wants to identify with the person on stage, or the person whose 
record they've just bought.  It's not conscious racism, but I think white 
audiences have found it easier to identify with white musicians.<P>

<B>WS</B>:  That doesn't seem to be so much the case any longer, does 
it?<P>

<B>FD</B>:  Well, no . . . I don't think it is.  And that's maybe another 
way in which everything has become inverted.  <P>

<B>WS</B>:  Jazz has often had a fair amount of politics swirling around 
it -- whether or not it's self-consciously in the music -- but at one 
point in the introduction to <I>Bebop and Nothingness</I> you say that we 
may be fast approaching a day when jazz will be considered <I>politically 
incorrect</I>. What do you mean? <P>

<B>FD</B>: It's that I think we're approaching a day when jazz will be seen 
as elitist.  In fact, it already is.  There are some people in 
academic and intellectual circles who are saying that improvisation is 
elitist and male.  Which is silly because so much of the world's music, 
once you leave the U.S., once you leave North America, is improvised.  You 
could argue the opposite.  You could argue that composition is elitist and 
hierarchical, and so on.  But these things are seen differently at 
different times.  <P>

But jazz is a very male pursuit -- let's face it.  It's not only that there 
have been very few important women instrumentalists.  There are more now, 
but they're still greatly outnumbered.  I also think the emphasis on 
tradition has something to do with it.  <P>

<B>WS</B>:  In <I>Bebop and Nothingness</I> you deal with many other forms 
of music outside the jazz mainstream, with figures on what you call the 
"well-populated fringes," as well as with popular music. What do you see 
in these other forms, and in pop especially, that are promising or at 
least interesting?<P>

<B>FD</B>:  I think the reason I still listen to as much pop as I do is 
that I've never outgrown my love of song. And sometimes that's an element 
that's missing in jazz -- the direct, immediate fulfillment of that love.  
You don't have to look to rock 'n roll for it; you can find it in Stephen 
Sondheim or in Sinatra or Tony Bennett. I don't follow pop the way I used to, because 
it's not for <I>me</I> anymore.  It's not my battle cry, or whatever, the 
way it was when I was seventeen or eighteen.   A lot of people listen to 
jazz -- and here's another way in which jazz is elitist -- a lot of people 
listen to jazz because they figure, "Well, I've outgrown pop, that's kids' 
stuff."  <P>

The pieces on pop that are in the book have some relation to jazz, even if 
it's not a very obvious relation.  The pieces on rap and on Michael 
Jackson and Prince, for example, talk a lot about race -- a subject that's 
always germane to jazz.<P>

<B>WS:</B> Is there anything in pop that you'd like to see rub off on 
jazz?  <P>

<B>FD:</B> This doesn't exactly answer that question, but I've been 
listening lately to a lot of ska.  Last summer I happened to be in Santa 
Cruz and there was a Sunday night reggae show on the radio and the guy was 
playing mostly ska. It was like entering another world; I didn't know what 
I was hearing. This is something I'd like to write a piece on eventually, 
and I've since listened to a lot of the stuff.  One of the interesting 
developments is that there are a number of American bands who are playing 
jazz tunes in ska versions, and not in a gimmicky way.  There's a group 
comprised of various members of The Toasters and The Skatalites, called 
the New York Ska Jazz Ensemble that has one record out.   They do really 
fun, inventive versions of Mingus tunes and Monk tunes that are 
re-conceived as ska and that work wonderfully. It's pretty infectious 
stuff, pretty irresistible.  I think that if more jazz people listen to it 
they'd like it. I'd like to hear more jazz with a comparable sense of fun.  <P>

<B>WS</B>:  How do you feel about certain movements like acid jazz, 
movements that bring in contemporary pop music and try to merge it with 
jazz?  Hasn't that kind of fusion been part of the history of jazz? And do 
you think that pop or that other forms of music, other influences from 
outside Western culture, whatever they may be, may have a role to play in 
its future? <P>

<B>FD</B>: Sure.  I wouldn't dismiss anything out of hand.  I haven't heard 
much in acid jazz that I find interesting.  But I will single out someone, 
who I think comes under that heading -- at least in terms of the way he's 
marketed: a guitar player from San Francisco, who is in his late twenties, 
named Charlie Hunter.  He's recorded two albums for Blue Note.  He's a very 
interesting player.  On his first Blue Note album he has a cover version of 
a Nirvana song called "Come As You Are" which is wonderful.  He translates 
it very successfully into jazz without distorting what was good about the 
Nirvana song to begin with.  <P>

You know, jazz has absorbed whatever was around from the very 
beginning.  You can argue that it's an African retention of some sort, but 
where does that harmonic system come from if not from the West?  If not 
from what people refer to as Europe in the larger sense? So it absorbed 
that, and over the last twenty, thirty years, it's absorbed a lot of music 
-- including Eastern music.  I don't think you can dismiss any style of 
jazz out of hand.  I wasn't much of a fan of fusion in the '70s, but it 
yielded in an indirect way Ornette Coleman's harmolodic music -- Ornette 
Coleman's electric phase -- which is great stuff.  Anything has the 
potential to yield good results.<P>

<B>WS</B>:  In "Like Young" you wonder whether these young jazz musicians 
are playing a music without a future.  Do you think jazz has a future?  <P>

<B>FD</B>:  It certainly has a future in a literal sense, in that 
people will always be playing something that is recognizable as jazz.  I 
guess the question is, Will it remain vital?  Or will it just become so 
hardened and so set that it just doesn't have much to offer people, aside 
from the not inconsequential pleasure of craftsmanship. I 
think that what chased me away as a kid was the idea that serious people 
listen to this music and people who know what's "good" listen to this 
music. But the future of any art form depends on a certain number of 
eighteen-year-olds in each generation deciding that something is fun and 
that they like it.<p>

<font size=5>Y</font>OUTH has become the most frequent topic of 

conversation in jazz.  The talk concerns a crop of instrumentalists in 

their twenties and very early thirties, including the tenor saxophonists 

Joshua Redman and James Carter, the trumpeters Roy Hargrove and Nicholas 

Payton, the pianists Cyrus Chestnut and Jacky Terrasson, and the bassist 

Christian McBride, who are supposedly luring audiences their own age and 

younger to jazz.  <P>







This accent on youth could be interpreted as an effort to shake the blues 

of just a few years ago, when all anybody in jazz seemed to talk about was 

death. Sarah Vaughan died early in 1990, followed in less than three years 

by <a href="http://www.actlab.utexas.edu/~horshak/greatday/blakey.html">

Art Blakey</a>, Stan Getz, Miles Davis, and <a href="http://www.mtn.org/dcs

/Artists/DizQuiz/DQ00.html">Dizzy Gillespie</a>. Along with 

grief, these deaths triggered panic that time might also be running out 

for jazz as a commercially viable form of music. Jazz was already short of 

marquee names when the nineties began; the loss of five more left what 

threatened to become a permanent void at the top of the bill.<P>



Some New York&#173;based critics blamed their city's club owners and the 

producers of the annual <a href="http://www.jazzcentralstation.com/jcs/

station/jazzdest/festivals/index.html">JVC Jazz Festival</a> 

for having failed to groom 

successors to bebop's aging stars. JVC, in particular, was in danger of 

becoming an annual series of memorial concerts. Even so, the assumption 

that presenters of live music still turn the crank of the star-making 

machinery strikes me as naive. <P>



Duke Ellington used to say that he was born in Newport, Rhode Island, in 

1956. He meant reborn at that summer's Newport Jazz Festival, when an 

outbreak of dancing in the aisles during his band's performance of 

"Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue" helped to land him on the cover of 

<I>Time</I>. Most of today's major festivals are in Europe, though, and 

there are far too many of them for any single one to matter in quite the 

same way that Newport used to. <P>



An increasing number of festivals defray their costs by subletting their 

stages to record companies for "An Afternoon With Blue Note" or "An 

Evening With Columbia." In most cases the entire festival might as well be 

programmed by record companies, because only performers who have a major 

label's publicity campaign behind them draw big crowds today. Word of 

mouth about a newcomer or a resurgent veteran can still begin at an 

overseas festival, in a New York nightclub, or occasionally in a favorable 

notice by an influential critic. But only the major labels have the juice 

to amplify such word of mouth into what broadcasters and newspaper and 

magazine editors traditionally unreceptive to jazz might recognize as a 

buzz. Once a buzz gets started, the role of everyone who hopes to win 

bigger numbers for jazz--including compliant critics--becomes to 

keep it going.<P>

<BR>



<font size=5>T</font>HE loudest buzz right now is about the above-named younger musicians, who 

are credited with bringing jazz back to life or--what might amount to 

the same thing--putting more warm bodies into the seats. It should 

come as no surprise that the most talked-about of them happen to record 

for the large companies. <a href= "http://www.jazzradio.org/Clients/MurrayStreet

/Jazz/JoshuaRedmanBio.HTML">Joshua Redman</a> may prove to be the most talented 

in the group; at twenty-seven, he's already far and away the most 

successful, with sales of each of his first three Warner Bros. albums 

having topped 100,000. Last fall DKNY Menswear (the designer Donna Karan's 

line of casual wear for "the urban guy who lives for the risk") outfitted 

Redman and his sidemen for their fifty-city tour to promote <I>Spirit of 

the Moment: Live at the Village Vanguard </I>(Warner Bros. 9 45923-2), 

Redman's fourth release. This was hailed as a breakthrough: pop stars who 

go on the road to promote their new albums can usually count on corporate 

sponsorship to offset the costs of their tours, but jazz performers are 

rarely so blessed. <P>



With corporate underwriting taking the place of federal arts funding, we 

may soon see a new form of Social Darwinism: survival of the cutest. In 

addition to being photogenic, Redman is good copy twice over--as a 

second-generation jazz musician (his father is the tenor saxophonist Dewey 

Redman, formerly a sideman with Ornette Coleman and a member of Old and 

New Dreams), and even more so as a Harvard summa cum laude who passed up 

Yale Law School for a career in jazz. <P>



You could call it the <a href="http://www.jazzradio.org/Clients/MurrayStreet/

Jazz/WyntonMarsalisBio.HTML">Wynton Marsalis</a> factor. Every ten years or so, for a 

different set of reasons each time, cultural trendsetters rally behind one 

musician with whom they sense a bond and who then comes to symbolize jazz 

to the mass media. Before Marsalis it happened in turn to Dave Brubeck, 

Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett. Marsalis improbably 

combined youthful arrogance with an obeisance to tradition that bordered 

on ancestor worship; Columbia's success in marketing him persuaded the 

other majors that the trick to selling jazz was to play up its genealogy 

and long history of esoteric appeal even while attempting to demystify it 

by means of trim young figures in designer suits. Though unprecedented in 

recent memory, the election of a <I>type</I> of musician to carry the 

banner for jazz was probably inevitable, given the difficulty of finding 

another performer as charismatic as Marsalis and given the longstanding 

preference of magazine editors for pieces on jazz "trends," as opposed to 

on individual musicians. <P>



At thirty-four, <A 

HREF="http://www.jazzworld.com/Artist_Info/wyntonmarsalis/">Marsalis is 

more visible than ever</A>, what with his recent books and radio and 

television programs.  But he doesn't sell as many albums as he used to, and 

tempting as it is to put the blame for this on a combination of 

overexposure and the ill will he has aroused as the artistic director of <A 

HREF="http://www.jazzworld.com/JALC/about.html">Jazz at Lincoln Center</a> 

(he has been accused of cronyism, ageism, reverse racism, and 

narrow-mindedness in closing the doors of that establishment to reputed 

avant-gardists), I think there's another explanation--one entirely to 

Marsalis's credit as an artist unwilling to let his audience tell him who 

he is.  <P>



Marsalis initially won mass acceptance as a kind of substitute<a href="

http://www.wam.umd.edu/~losinp/music/ahead.html"> Miles 

Davis</a>, and many of his fans were taken by surprise when his efforts to 

define himself as a composer led him to embrace New Orleans polyphony and 

Duke Ellington's talking horns. Marsalis's dance suites and extended 

compositions have been extremely uneven, but the problem with them from 

the standpoint of units sold may be that dance suites and extended 

compositions simply aren't what his fans expect from him or want from 

jazz. Marsalis's emphasis on composition has created an opening for Redman 

and the others. None has yet demonstrated much interest in larger forms, 

though many have inherited some of Marsalis's other traits, including his 

attitude toward tradition and innovation.<P>



The animosity with which a lot of jazz critics regard Marsalis owes 

something to his having usurped their authority. His pronouncements on 

jazz in interviews and in occasional bylined articles carry more weight 

with readers than do those of any of us who write regularly about jazz 

(including even Albert Murray and Stanley Crouch, Marsalis's associates at 

Lincoln Center). And in turning thumbs down on most of the innovations in 

jazz since 1960--in vehemently insisting that it can't be jazz if it 

doesn't swing from beginning to end and explicitly refer to the 

blues--Marsalis has been telling disgruntled longtime listeners 

exactly what they were waiting to hear. <P>



I used to believe that what scared most people away from jazz was their 

suspicion that they would be bored by it. In the case of much latter-day 

bebop, with its lineup of soloists running down the chords to no apparent 

purpose after stating a sketchy theme not to be heard again until the end, 

boredom is a reasonable response. The solution, I always thought, was to 

expose people to kinds of jazz in which composition and improvisation 

overlap, and in which something is going on in every measure. It wouldn't 

have to be Muhal Richard Abrams or Sun Ra or anything too far out; it 

could be Ellington or <a href="http://amadeus.siba.fi/~eonttone/mingus/">

Charles Mingus</a> or even Marsalis's score for the 1990 

movie <I>Tune In Tomorrow</I>. But if new audiences are flocking to jazz 

on the heels of a generation of musicians who were themselves receptive to 

Marsalis's ideology at an impressionable age, I must be wrong. People who 

have never really listened to jazz want it to go on sounding the way 

they've been led to believe it should, so that they'll be able to 

recognize it in case they ever chance to hear any.<P>



Longtime jazz listeners, for their part, want jazz to be as it was in the 

fifties and early sixties, when a devotion to jazz was still a sign of 

being hip. <a href="http://metrobeat.com:80/nyc/locations/lmc0174.html">

Iridium</a>, a fairly new Manhattan club, features on its menu 

mixed drinks described as "retro cocktails." The adjective could also be 

applied to most of the music now heard in New York's front-line 

clubs--especially when the players on the bandstand are roughly the 

age that Miles Davis and <a href="http://www.inetworld.net/~keith/coltrane.

john/">John Coltrane</a> are in those vintage 

black-and-whites on the walls of the <a href="http://metrobeat.com/nyc/

locations/lmc0274.html">Village Vanguard</a>.<P>

<BR>



<font size=5>T</font>HE most evocative of all jazz photographs might be one taken by Art Kane 

for a 1959 issue of <I>Esquire</I>, showing fifty-seven musicians, famous 

and obscure, posed outside a brownstone on East 126th Street in Harlem. 

Inspired by the success of Jean Bach's lovely 1994 film <a href="

http://www.beatthief.com/greatday.html"><I>A Great Day in 

Harlem</I></a>, which examined both Kane's photograph and what else went on 

among the musicians that day, <I>Life</I> magazine last fall assembled ten 

of the twelve survivors to have their picture taken outside the same 

brownstone (now gutted and missing its cornice). By coincidence, it was 

the day of the Million Man March, when there was much talk on radio and 

television about the shortage of positive male role models in black 

communities. Some exemplary role models were on the steps in Harlem that 

day: dedicated artists and family men such as the tenor saxophonist Benny 

Golson, the trumpeter Art Farmer, the bassist Milt Hinton, and the pianist 

Hank Jones. Jazz could also offer inspiration in the stories of those 

musicians who reclaimed their lives from drugs (for every Charlie Parker 

there's a Sonny Rollins). That jazz goes virtually unmentioned in the 

national discourse on race underlines its diminished relevance to everyday 

African-American life. <P>



If this helps to explain why the emergence of talented instrumentalists 

not much older than the members of Boyz II Men answers a prayer, it also 

raises the question of whether a player's race much matters at this point. 

All but a few of the younger musicians being pushed by major labels are 

black; this has created a backlash of sorts among white musicians, who 

feel left out. <P>



The harshest critics of today's newcomers are not whites but musicians 

over forty who lament that they themselves were young too soon--a 

decade or so before Marsalis, when an unspoken grandfather clause was in 

effect at record companies and only old masters whose careers pre-dated 

rock-and-roll were eligible for jazz stardom. "The young lions," as 

everyone seems to call today's young musicians, are an easy sell to 

longtime jazz fans, who recall the seventies and early eighties with a 

shudder. Unlike their immediate elders, these newcomers don't have 

synthesizers in their closets to apologize for. Nor are they asked to 

atone for the excesses of the period, not so long ago, when cutting-edge 

jazz was associated with a black-separatist agenda. However much they 

revere the past, they're not tainted by its compromises, as musicians who 

actually lived through it tend to be. <P>



Nobody resents these recent arrivals for making a splash. Instead they're 

resented for <I>not</I> making waves the way <a href="

http://www.roughguides.com/RG_WWW/JAZZ/PARKER.html">Charlie Parker</a> and Dizzy 

Gillespie did in the 1940s and young players have been counted on to do 

periodically ever since. (Even Marsalis stirred things up, albeit in his 

own way.) There are no <a href="http://www.achilles.net:80/~howardm/

tsmonk.html">Thelonious Monks</a> or <a href="http://www.eyeneer.com/Jazz/

Ornette/index.html">Ornette Colemans</a> in this 

bunch--no innovators or woolly eccentrics among those we've heard from 

so far. In setting craftsmanship as their highest goal these neophytes 

remind me of such second-tier stars of the fifties and sixties as Blue 

Mitchell and Wynton Kelly--players whose modesty and good taste made 

them ideal sidemen but whose own record dates invariably lacked the dark 

corners and disfigurements of character that separate great music from 

merely good. <P>

<BR>



<font size=5>S</font>OMETHING further inhibiting this latest generation is the idea that the 

future of their art form, as well as their own careers, rides on the 

commercial success of their CDs. In concert Roy Hargrove can be positively 

fiery, but his albums--including the recent <I>Parker's Mood</I> 

(Verve 314 527 907-2), a collection of tunes written by or associated with 

Charlie Parker which also features Christian McBride and the pianist 

Stephen Scott--have been cautious and bland. The same is true of 

Nicholas Payton, a prodigiously gifted trumpeter barely out of his teens 

whose work on <I>From This Moment </I>. . . (Verve 314 527 073-2) comes 

across as "mature" in all the wrong ways, owing to an overabundance of 

medium tempos and minor keys, plus the restraining effect of no fewer than 

three chording instruments (Mulgrew Miller's piano, Mark Whitfield's 

guitar, and Monty Croft's vibes).<P>



Blandness and premature solemnity aren't among James Carter's worries. If 

anything, he would do well to calm down. Carter's main horn is tenor, but 

he's also proficient on a variety of other reeds and woodwinds, including 

soprano, alto, and baritone saxophones. He's the only one of the 

major-label young players with avant-garde credentials, having worked with 

Lester Bowie and the late Julius Hemphill, among others, before starting 

his own quartet. Because of this, he's regarded by many as a kind of gap 

sealer--a figure who deserves praise for drawing on both "inside" and 

"outside" approaches to improvisation. Carter might erupt in screams even 

on a ballad or a medium-tempo groove tune, his rhythm section suspending 

the beat as it pummels its instruments into cacophony. This lends an 

element of unpredictability to Carter's solos, but the problem is that his 

solos are always unpredictable in exactly the same way. I suspect that 

even those listeners who shun what used to be called free jazz for fear of 

just such episodes willingly go along with Carter because they know his 

paroxysms will be short-lived. Minus the thematic development that is 

possible in free improvisation, his farrago-like solos reduce thirty years 

of sonic exploration to a handy vocabulary of stock effects not much 

different from the honks and screams of the average rhythm-and-blues 

saxophonist of the 1950s. <P>



Even so, Carter's virtues almost outweigh his faults.  Though primarily 

influenced by John Coltrane, Wayne Shorter, and Sonny Rollins, today's 

tenor saxophonists have begun to investigate the work of a host of muscular 

and once overlooked players of the 1950s and 1960s, typified by the late 

Gene Ammons.  Not for nothing were Ammons and others of this school (whose 

own role models were Arnett Cobb, Illinois Jacquet, and Ben Webster) 

frequently referred to as "tough" tenors.  They turned up-tempo numbers 

into bloody brawls and more or less shadowed the melody on ballads, like a 

pulp detective tailing a beautiful woman he thinks he's falling in love 

with but doesn't quite trust.  The style calls for a lot of swagger, and 

Carter might be the only young saxophonist who has the size for it.  His 

best recorded performances in this vein, in which he displays an effortless 

swing rare for an improviser of any age, are his two versions of Duke 

Ellington's "The Stevedore's Serenade," one on <I>The Real Quietstorm</I> 

(Atlantic Jazz 82742) and the other on a promotional CD of duets with Cyrus 

Chestnut from early last year, which was distributed to journalists and 

radio stations but not released commercially. <P>



<I>The Real Quietstorm</I>--not a make-out album, despite its title 

and cover shot of Carter with his fianc&eacute;e draped all over 

him--opens and closes with examples of Carter's graceful control of 

his baritone saxophone's upper register. He's such a talented musician 

that it becomes all the more frustrating when he screams gratuitously, 

when he taps the keys of his saxophone while breathing into it to produce 

a sound like that of a rusty pipe, when he slurps up to a note or holds a 

note for several measures--these are devices that can be put to 

imaginative use, but twenty-seven is awfully young for a musician to be 

falling back on them on nearly every number. Carter's most questionable 

trait may be his habit of interpolating familiar licks from Ellington, 

Gershwin, and Charlie Parker into solos in which they simply don't belong. 

Quoting can be an art; <a href="http://pantheon.cis.yale.edu/~jnilsen/

dex.html">Dexter Gordon</a> was a master at jimmying one song's 

chords until they fit the chords of another. His quotations were often 

delightful for being so off the wall. Carter's are merely patterns that 

fall easily under his fingers and help to kill time: musical equivalents 

of borrowing "To be or not to be" or "All the world's a stage." The one he 

ought to try is "To thine own self be true."<P>

<BR>



<font size=5>W</font>HEN I saw Carter perform at the Montreal International Jazz Festival last 

summer, he strutted across the stage as if he were already a star, 

displaying an abundance of what a rock or hip-hop audience might call 

attitude. His playing was loopy, even by his own standards. My notes don't 

mention what he was wearing, but if I close my eyes and recall the spin 

and pop of his phrases, I can see him dressed to kill in a long-tailed 

yellow zoot suit and a feathered fedora, like Jim Carrey in <I>The 

Mask</I>. I kept expecting him to roll himself into a bouncing rubber 

ball, or to hiss with satisfaction, <a href="http://www.inforamp.net

/~petroff/jpg/mask.jpg">"<I>Sss</I>omebody <I>sss</I>top me!" </a>

Carter seems that intent on turning himself into a special 

effect--though so much sanctimony now surrounds jazz that his 

insincerity is refreshing, in a curious sort of way. Carter's most recent 

release, <I>Conversin' With the Elders </I>(Atlantic Records ATL 82908), 

which features numbers by John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, and Lester Young, 

and also guest appearances by the tenor saxophonist and clarinetist Buddy 

Tate and the trumpeters Lester Bowie and Harry "Sweets"Edison, among 

others, casts Carter in a reverential role to which he doesn't seem very 

well suited. <P>



Joshua Redman was another of the festival's headliners. I thought I sensed 

an element of rivalry between him and Carter even before hearing them go 

head to head on the soundtrack of Robert Altman's <I>Kansas City</I> 

(Verve 314 529 554-2) and reading an article on Carter in <I>New York</I>, 

in which he boasted of having taken Redman's measure in a bandstand 

showdown (and of having caught the eye of Redman's girlfriend). With 

Carter stealing some of his ink, Redman seems to be favoring a broader 

style of playing than he did just a few years ago. He, too, risks 

overdoing a few pet devices, the most annoying of which is the comic 

upper-register burp that he uses to end far too many of his lines--to 

the apparent delight of audiences. <P>



On <I>Spirit of the Moment</I>, which was recorded last March, Redman 

sounds much as he did in Montreal.  The average new jazz CD is too long: 

though consumers seem to like the idea of an hour or more of music at a 

pop, the playing time practically ensures inconsistency--especially on the 

part of younger performers who haven't yet learned to pace themselves.  

<I>Spirit of the Moment</I>'s two discs clock in at almost two and a half 

hours, and this is more than enough time to showcase Redman's obvious 

gifts.  The most notable of these might be his admirable sense of up-tempo 

melodic continuity ("Slapstick" is the best of several examples), his 

success at forming a band in his own image (the drummer Brian Blade is 

especially tuned in to him), and his increasing maturity as a balladeer.  

Such a generous helping of Redman also serves to expose the derivative 

nature of many of his solos.  His debt to Sonny Rollins is plain on Jule 

Styne's "Just in Time," from <I>Bells Are Ringing</I>.  When Rollins 

recorded the song, he was having fun with a show tune; Redman is playing 

Rollins, and setting the bar far too high for either him or us to have much 

fun.  Critics used to chide Branford Marsalis for mimicking a different 

tenor player on every number.  His Zelig-like approach is now standard 

among younger players.  Oddly enough, it's on <I>Spirit of the Moment</I>'s 

most Coltrane-influenced performance--"Dialogue," a modal folksong-like 

dirge similar to Coltrane's "Alabama"--that Redman gives promise of finding 

his own voice, in his elegant and suspenseful shadow play with the rhythm 

section.  <P>



"Dialogue" first appeared on Redman's 1994 studio album <I>MoodSwing</I>, 

which also featured a tune called "Chill," a syncopated finger-snapper that 

drew a cheer of recognition from Redman's audience in Montreal.  "Chill" is 

a cleverly constructed tune, funky and relaxed, much like something Horace 

Silver or Bobby Timmons might have written in the early 1960s, but with a 

bridge that goes all the way back to Lionel Hampton's swing-era anthem 

"Flying Home." On first hearing "Chill," I thought the bridge was the reason that 

Redman's melody struck me as so familiar, but in Montreal, I realized how 

similar the tune's cadences are to those of an obscure pop song I doubt 

Redman has ever heard.<P>



<BR>



<font size=5>T</font>HAT song is Andr&eacute; Previn and Paul Francis 

Webster's "Like Young," a track from Perry Como's 1961 album <I>Young at 

Heart</I> which resurfaced a few years ago on Rhino/Word Beat's <I>The Beat 

Generation</I>, a likably goofy multi-disc set aimed at people whose 

serious interest in Allen Ginsberg and <I>On the Road</I> doesn't preclude 

an affection for Maynard G.  Krebs and <I>Route 66</I>.  Webster's lyrics 

have the clueless, middle-aged Como flipping for a girl who "goes where all 

the angry young men go," "recites poetry," and "drinks coffee with 

caf&eacute; espresso." She's got Como feeling "like young," but he's really 

just showing his age.  <P>



Jazz is showing its age too, or else why would there now be such a 

preoccupation with youth?  Charlie Parker was twenty-five when he recorded 

"Ko Ko" and "Now's the Time"; he was dead at thirty-four, Wynton Marsalis's 

age now.  Ornette Coleman was twenty-nine and not considered especially 

young when he caught the world by surprise with <I>The Shape of Jazz to 

Come</I>, in 1959.  There have always been young jazz musicians, but only 

lately has anyone made a fuss over them just for <I>being</I> 

young--instead of for auguring change.  <P>



Are more young people listening to jazz because they can identify with 

Redman and the others? From what I've noticed, the answer is yes only if 

you count as "young" dating couples in their late twenties and early 

thirties. I've been to shows where the youngest people in the house were 

on the bandstand. In allowing itself to become so strongly identified with 

its past, jazz may be bargaining away its future. Positioning jazz as a 

sane acoustic alternative to raucous, mechanized pop might be an effective 

short-term sales strategy, but doesn't all this sanctimony about 

"tradition" and the emphasis on boilerplate bebop send a message to 

teenagers and college students that jazz offers absolutely nothing of 

interest to them? And isn't whatever the form of music that rings 

someone's bells at eighteen or nineteen likely to remain his or her music 

of choice for life? <P>



Something else to worry about is what happens if today's whiz kids fail to 

sell albums in numbers sufficient to justify the generous advances that 

record companies are giving them (Jacky Terrasson, for example, is rumored 

to have signed with Blue Note for $100,000). The majors are likely to take 

this as evidence that jazz just doesn't sell. It wouldn't be the first 

time they've arrived at this conclusion and then turned it into a 

self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>

<blockquote>

	
	<font size=5>I</font>n his article in the July, 1996, issue of <i>The 
	Atlantic</i>, Francis Davis considers the state of jazz in the 
	1990s and wonders if today's "young lions," oriented as they are
	toward the past, can carry the music forward. Since 1922, 
	<i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> has published writing on 
	jazz, particularly since the arrival of the current Editor, William
	Whitworth, in 1981. To provide background and lend context to Davis's
	current piece, we have selected twenty past <i>Atlantic</i> articles 
	on jazz. We hope this collection of essays -- by no means a comprehensive
	survey of jazz history and styles -- will be helpful in thinking about some
	of the questions being raised in jazz criticism today -- including the
	question of the music's future.<p>
	
	<p>
	<p>
	<br>
	
	<ul>
	
	<li><a href="./Cengel.htm">"Jazz: A Musical Discussion,"</a> by Carl Engel (August 
	1922)<br>
	The first serious essay on jazz published in <i>The Atlantic</i>, Engel's 
	1922 article declares: "Jazz is upon us, everywhere. To deny the fact is
	to assume the classic ostrich pose, head buried in the sand, tail feathers
	to the sun."<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Bass.htm">"Non-Jazz Jazz,"</a> by Milton Bass (October 1952)<br>
	Critic Milton Bass examined the jazz musicians of 1952 who began "using 
	the surface techniques of classical music as a base for their own little 
	improvisations." These innovative musicians included the likes of Gunther 
	Schuller, John Lewis, Dave Brubeck, and Stan Getz.<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Balliett.htm">"Jazz Today,"</a> by Whitney Balliett (November 1953)<br>
	The twenty-eight year old Balliet attributed the "vigorous, sound condition" of jazz in 
	1953 to the "revolution -- called, variously, kloop mop, re-bop, bebop, 
	and cool music." Balliet also points out that with the advent of the tape 
	recorder and the long-playing record, the place of jazz "has become a 
	permanent part of our musical library."<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Sundgaar.htm">"Jazz, Hot and Cold"</a> by Arnold Sundgaard (July 1955)<br>
	"Jazz, by its very nature, is a kind of freedom rooted in the sense of 
	responsibility," proclaimed Sundgaard, a jazz composer.
	In addition to such pronouncements, he also gives a brief history of jazz up to
	1955 and discusses the state of jazz in that year.<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Palmer.htm">"Ornette Coleman and the Circle with a Hole in the 
	Middle,"</a>
	by Robert Palmer (December 1972)<br>
 	Robert Palmer visited Coleman in his SoHo loft to shoot pool and discuss 
 	the musician's philosophy on art, jazz composition, and the difficulties of
 	race in America.<p>
 	
 	<li><a href="./Townsend.htm">"Ellington in Private," </a> by Irving Townsend (May 1975)<br>
	The Columbia Records executive producer recounts his first meeting with
	Duke Ellington backstage at the 1956 Newport Jazz festival and writes about
	the personality of the elusive composer, with whom he worked 
	during the recording session of <i>A Drum Is A Woman</i>.<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Dbasie.htm">"The Loss of Count Basie,"</a> by Francis Davis (August 
	1984)<br>
	"Among big-band leaders only Duke Ellinton exerted more long-term 
	influence upon jazz and American popular music than Count Basie," 
	observes Davis. Ellington's and Basie's styles differed greatly, however;
	Ellington was a writer of jazz composition whereas Basie functioned more 
	as an editor.<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Dornette.htm">"Ornette's Permanent Revolution,"</a> by Franics Davis 
	(September 1985)<br> 
	"All hell broke loose when the alto saxophonist Ornette Coleman made his 
	East Coast debut, at the Five Spot Cafe, in Greenwich Village, on November 
	17, 1959." Davis considers the effect of the revolutionary free-jazz movement
	spawned by Coleman on that fateful night.<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Ullman.htm">"Melodic Trumpet,"</a> by Michael Ullman (December 1985)<br>
	"Sometime in 1954, when he was twenty-four years old, the trumpeter 
	Clifford Brown became one of the greatest jazz soloists." Tragically, 
	two years later, Brown, the "clean-living, soft-spoken family man," was dead.<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Dproxy.htm">Creator by Proxy,"</a> by Francis Davis (February 1987)<br>
	Neither an "arranger" (too limited a designation) nor "composer" (too 
	grandiose), Gil Evans was more of an improvisational translator. His 
	genius lay in isolating and expanding various source materials, such as "a 
	provocative passing chord, an insistent rhythmic vamp, or an unexpected 
	melodic ellipsis."<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Dlgscale.htm">"Large-Scale Jazz,"</a> by Francis Davis (August 1987)<br>
	In the 1980s jazz composers were seen as the new innovators, relegating 
	improvisers to secondary status. If one accepts the fact that composition
	was the key element in jazz in the 1980s, however, the central 
	figure of the decade was clearly Duke Ellington, although he died in 1974.<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Strickla.htm">"What Coltrane Wanted,"</a> by Edward Strickland (December 
	1987)<br>
	"The stellar avant-garde saxophonist has become a jazz legend of stature
	shared only by Louis Armstrong and Charlie Parker," Strickland points out.
	In this essay the author focuses on Coltrane's relentless search 
	for musical possibilities.<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Dborn.htm">"Born Out of Time,"</a> by Francis Davis (April 1988)<br>
	In an essay anticipating his July, 1996, essay "Like Young," Davis 
	considered the influence of the then twenty-six year old trumpeter 
	Wynton Marsalis and the extent of his influence on musicians his
	own age and younger.<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Dbird.htm">"Bird on Film,"</a> by Francis Davis (November 1988)<br>
	In 1988 Clint Eastwood produced and directed <i>Bird</i>, a movie about
	the life of Charlie Parker. Unfortunately, according to Davis, the film 
	"wants to shout 'Bird Lives!' but winds up whispering 'Jazz is dead.'"<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Dbook.htm">"The Book on Miles,"</a> by Francis Davis (January 1990)<br>
	At age sixty-three, Miles Davis, a man fully aware that "his art and life
	were already the stuff of legend," published <i> Miles: The 
	Autobiography</i>. In this review, Francis Davis reflects on the life
	of one of jazz's most important yet controversial figures.<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Dzorn.htm">"'Zorn' for 'Anger,'" </a> by Francis Davis (January 1991)<br>
	"John Zorn is the only musician I've ever considered suing," writes Davis. 
	Despite his bad boy image and the eardrum shattering volume of his live
	performances, Zorn's contribution to recent avant-garde music, especially 
	his interpretations of film music, cannot be dismissed.<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Dbetter.htm">"Better With Age,"</a> by Francis Davis (September 1991)<br>
	At the age of eighty-four, Benny Carter offered audiences "a singular 
	thrill -- the chance to look back on history as it continues to unfold." 
	In addition to appreciating Carter's longevity, Davis also 
	recognizes Carter's impressive contributions to jazz composition.<p>
	
	<li><a href="./Dmanhorn.htm"> "Man with a Horn,"</a> by Francis Davis (March 1992)<br>
	As Stanley Crouch has observed, "Dizzy Gillespie carried and projected 
	the moxie, the curiosity, the wit, and the pathos that enliven the world 
	of jazz." Here Francis Davis captures the indefatigable vitality of the
	great bebop trumpeter in an essay published a year before Gillespie's death.<p>
	
	<li><a href="./schiff.htm">"Built Pieces,"</a> by David Schiff (January 1995)<br>
     Duke Ellington's uncanny knack as a musical "assembler" causes Schiff 
     to observe, "As a musical architect and an alchemist of tone
     color, Ellington resembles Stravinsky more than he does an improvisational
     genius like John Coltrane."<p>
	
    <li><a href="../../issues/96jan/bud/bud.htm"> "Bud's Bubble,"</a> by Francis Davis (January 1996)<br>
	The seminal bebop pianist Bud Powell absorbed and extended the musical 
	ideas of Charlie Parker, Art Tatum, and Thelonious Monk. But his genius
	was a victim of his madness.<p>
	<p>
	</ul>

The effects of this largest peacetimedeficit in America's history are still being debated, but there is generalagreement on its two main causes: Ronald Reagan's tax cuts and his defensebuildup. Throughout the 1980s <i>The Atlantic </i>examined the evidence for andagainst each of these policies. In a series of articles, beginning with WilliamGreider's 1981 <A HREF="../../atlweb/flashbks/classics/stockman.htm">"TheEducation of David Stockman,"</A> the magazine found that tax cuts were stimulating consumption at the expense of saving and investment, andworsening social inequality at a time when the international economy was movingin the same baneful direction. We judged the defense buildup, which doubledPentagon spending, to be a reckless gamble to break the Soviet Union at the riskof breaking the U.S. budget. The Soviet Union was broken, though just how muchthe buildup contributed we leave to the historians. But, coupled with the taxcuts, the buildup did indeed break the budget.<p>The point of this look back at the past fifteen years? When the deficit is atlast brought under control, and the budget at last balanced, as President BillClinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich now both pledge will happen--as this fort offolly falls, in 2002 or 2005--Americans of that more solvent future will find<i>The Atlantic</i>'s body by the wall. On the deficit we have fought the goodfight.<p>That gives us standing to complain about Clinton's embrace of Gingrich's drive tobalance the budget. We approve the melody but not the lyrics. To repeat, thedeficit had two causes: tax cuts, directed chiefly at the most affluentAmericans, and the defense buildup. Yet neither tax increases nor defense cutsfigure in the Clinton deficit-reduction scenario. Absent tax increases to helpbalance the budget, Clinton will almost certainly have to make sociallyirresponsible cuts in the safety net for the poor and the health-security systemfor the elderly. Absent the reorientation of U.S. defense strategy that was madepossible by the end of the Cold War, Clinton will be unable to address the secondof what in the 1992 campaign he termed "twin deficits."<p>This is the "investment deficit." The phrase refers to the investments inphysical infrastructure and human capital that were not made in the 1980s becausethe tax cuts and the defense buildup did not leave sufficient resources andbecause Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush did not believe governmentshould make them. These forgone domestic investments are to tomorrow's economywhat the interstate highway system and the GI Bill were to today's--the necessaryconditions of future prosperity. While America went into deficit to give tax cutsto the affluent and to win the Cold War, its trading partners were going intodeficit to make these kinds of domestic investments. Yet, through NATO andthrough the Far Eastern forward deployment, America continues to pay for thedefense of these trading partners, against a threat that, at least in Europe, isall but extinct. There has to be a new reckoning here. We wish Clinton had begunit--we wish he had shown the historical imagination to grasp the possibility ofthis hour.<p>That possibility is to begin at once a return to the template of prosperity thatAmerica abandoned in 1917 in order to save Europe from the Kaiser, humanity fromHitler, and the free world from Stalin. Until then the United States was, in JaneJacobs's distinction, a trading nation; since then it has been a raidingnation--dispatching fleets and garrisoning soldiers around the world. Raiding hasgenerated its own prosperity, but it is a hectic and unstable one, founded on amutable threat. Historians may look back on the Reagan years as America's hour oftriumph against that threat. Or they may look back on those years as the timewhen the United States became the world's leading raiding nation--ironically,just when what Paul Kennedy called (in these pages) "the metric of power" waschanging in international relations, shifting from military might to economicpower, from raiding nations like the United States to trading nations like Japan.As long as Americans continued to tolerate huge budget deficits, it was at leastlogically possible to imagine that we could combine guns and butter, NATO anddomestic investment, raiding and trading. All that was needed was the right setof budgetary priorities. But a balanced budget that allows for an $80 billionannual subvention to NATO, the capacity to fight two full-scale warssimultaneously, and a strategic nuclear force freezes this country into theoutmoded posture of a raiding nation as the metric of power shifts inexorably.<p>"To govern is to choose," President John F. Kennedy said. We wish PresidentClinton had made different choices. This is a rare plastic moment in history, ifonly this country's leaders would realize it.</blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

	<font size=5>A</font>LL Hell broke loose when the alto saxophonist Ornette Coleman made his East

Coast nightclub debut, at the Five Spot Cafe, in Greenwich Village on November

17, 1959--twenty-five years ago last fall.<p>



<p>



The twenty-nine-year-old Coleman arrived in New York having already won the

approval of some of the most influential jazz opinion makers of the period.

"Ornette Coleman is doing the only really new thing in jazz since the

innovations in the mid-forties of Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and those of

Thelonious Monk," John Lewis, the pianist and musical director of the Modern

Jazz Quartet, is reported to have said after hearing Coleman in Los Angeles.

(Lewis later helped Coleman secure a contract with Atlantic Records.) Coleman's

other champions included the critics Nat Hentoff and Martin Williams and the

composer Gunther Schuller, all of whom wrote for the magazine <I>Jazz Review</I>. "I

honestly believe . . . that what Ornette Coleman is doing on alto will affect

the whole character of jazz music profoundly and pervasively," Williams wrote,

a month before Coleman opened at the Five Spot.<p>



<p>



Not all of Williams's colleagues shared his enthusiasm, once they were given

the opportunity to hear Coleman for themselves. In <I>Down Beat</I>, George Hoefer

described the reactions of the audience at a special press preview at the Five

Spot: "Some walked in and out before they could finish a drink, some sat

mesmerized by the sound, others talked constantly to their neighbors at the

table or argued with drink in hand at the bar." Many critics, finding Coleman's

music strident and incoherent, feared that his influence on jazz would be

deleterious. Others doubted that he would exert any influence on jazz at all.

Still others, bewildered by Coleman's music and preferring to take a

wait-and-see position on its merits, accused Coleman's supporters at <I>Jazz

Review</I> of touting Coleman for their own aggrandizement. Musicians--always

skeptical of newcomers, and envious of the publicity Coleman was

receiving--denounced him even more harshly than critics did. Some questioned

his instrumental competence; the outspoken Miles Davis questioned Coleman's

sanity.<p>



<p>



Internecine squabbling over the merits of historical movements and geographical

schools was nothing new in the jazz world. But not since a short-lived vogue

for the rather decrepit New Orleans trumpeter Bunk Johnson two decades earlier

(and perhaps not even then) had one musician split opinion so cleanly down the

middle. Coleman was either a visionary or a charlatan, and there was no middle

ground between advocacy and disapproval. The controversy raged, spreading from

the music journals to the daily newspapers and general-interest magazines,

where it gradually turned comic. Every VIP in Manhattan, from Leonard Bernstein

to Dorothy Kilgallen, seemed to have wisdom to offer on the subject of Ornette

Coleman. In Thomas Pynchon's novel <I>V.</I> there is a character named McClintic

Sphere, who plays an alto saxophone of hand-carved ivory (Coleman's was made of

white plastic) at a club called the V Note.<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

'He plays all the notes Bird missed,' somebody whispered in front of Fu. Fu

went silently through the motions of breaking a beer bottle on the edge of the

table, jamming it into the speaker's back and twisting.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>F</font>OR those of us who began listening to jazz after 1959, it is difficult to

believe that Coleman's music was once the source of such animus and widespread

debate. Given the low visibility of jazz today, a figure comparable to Coleman

arriving on the scene might find himself in the position of shouting "Fire" in

an empty theater.<p>



<p>



Looking back, it also strains belief that so many of Coleman's fellow musicians

initially failed to recognize the suppleness of his phrasing and the keening

vox-humana quality of his intonation. Jazz musicians have always respected

instrumentalists whose inflections echo the natural cadences of speech, and

they have always sworn by the blues (although as jazz has increased in

sophistication, "the blues" has come to signify a feeling or a tonal coloring,

in addition to a specific form). Coleman's blues authenticity--the legacy of

the juke joints in his native Fort Worth, Texas, where he had played as a

teenager--should have scored him points instantly. Instead, his ragged,

down-home sound seems to have cast him in the role of country cousin to

slicker, more urbanized musicians--as embarrassing a reminder of the past to

them as a Yiddish speaking relative might have been to a newly assimilated Jew.

In 1959 the "old country" for most black musicians was the American South, and

few of them wanted any part of it.<p>



<p>



What must have bothered musicians still more than the unmistakable southern

dialect of Coleman's music was its apparent formlessness, its flouting of rules

that most jazz modernists had invested a great deal of time and effort in

mastering. In the wake of bebop, jazz had become a music of enormous harmonic

complexity. By the late 1950s it seemed to be in danger of becoming a

playground for virtuosos, as the once liberating practice of running the chords

became routine. If some great players sounded at times as though they lacked

commitment and were simply going through the motions, it was because the

motions were what they had become most committed to.<p>



<p>



In one sense, the alternative that Coleman proposed amounted to nothing more

drastic than a necessary (and, in retrospect, inevitable) suppression of

harmony in favor of melody and rhythm--but that was regarded as heresy in 1959.

It has often been said that Coleman dispensed with recurring chord patterns

altogether, in both his playing and his writing. The comment is not entirely

accurate, however. Rather, he regarded a chord sequence as just one of many

options for advancing a solo. Coleman might improvise from chords or, as

inspiration moved him, he might instead use as his point of departure "a mood,

fragments of melody, an area of pitch, or rhythmic patterns," to quote the

critic Martin Williams. Moreover, Coleman's decision to dispense with a chordal

road map also permitted him rhythmic trespass across bar lines. The stealthy

rubato of Coleman's phrases and his sudden accelerations of tempo implied

liberation from strict meter, much as his penchant for hitting notes a

quarter-tone sharp or flat and his refusal to harmonize his saxophone with Don

Cherry's trumpet during group passages implied escape from the well-tempered

scale.<p>



<p>



Ultimately, rhythm may be the area in which Coleman has made his most

significant contributions to jazz. Perhaps the trick of listening to his

performances lies in an ability to hear rhythm as melody, the way he seems to

do, and the way early jazz musicians did. Some of Coleman's comeliest phrases,

like some of King Oliver's or Sidney Bechet's, sound as though they were

scooped off a drumhead.<p>



<p>



Coleman was hardly the only jazz musician to challenge chordal hegemony in

1959. John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, and Thelonious Monk, among

others, were looking beyond Charlie Parker's harmonic discoveries to some of

the rhythmic and structural implications of bop. Cecil Taylor and George

Russell were experimenting with chromaticism and pantonality, and a Miles Davis

Sextet featuring Coltrane and Bill Evans had just recorded <I>Kind of Blue</I>, an

album that introduced a new spaciousness to jazz by replacing chords with modes

and scales. But it was Coleman who was making the cleanest break with

convention, and Coleman whose intuitive vision of the future bore the most

natural relationship to the music's country origins. He was a godsend, as it

turned out.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>I</font>N 1959 Coleman's music truly represented Something Else (to quote the title of

his first album). Whether it also forecast The Shape of Jazz to Come (the title

of another early album of Coleman's) is still problematical. Certainly

Coleman's impact on jazz was immediate and it has proved long-lasting. Within a

few years of Coleman's first New York engagement established saxophonists like

Coltrane, Rollins, and Jackie McLean were playing a modified Colemanesque free

form, often in the company of former Coleman sidemen. The iconoclastic bassist

Charles Mingus (initially one of Coleman's antagonists) was leading a pianoless

quartet featuring the alto saxophonist Eric Dolphy and the trumpeter Ted

Curson, whose open-ended dialogues rivaled in abandon those of Coleman and

Cherry.<p>



<p>



Over the years Coleman has continued to cast a long shadow, as he has extended

his reach to symphonies, string quartets, and experiments in funk. By now he

has attracted two generations of disciples.<p>



<p>



There are the original sidemen in his quartet and their eventual replacements:

the trumpeters Cherry and Bobby Bradford; the tenor saxophonist Dewey Redman;

the bassists Charlie Haden, Scott LaFaro, Jimmy Garrison, and David Izenzon;

and the drummers Billy Higgins, Ed Blackwell, and Charles Moffett. These

musicians were followed in the late 1970s by younger ones who brought to

Coleman's bands the high voltage of rock and funk: for example, the guitarist

James Blood Ulmer, the electric bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and the drummer

Ronald Shannon Jackson. Some of Coleman's early associates in Texas and

California, such as the clarinetist John Carter and the flutist Prince Lawsha,

have gone on to produce work that shows Coleman's influence unmistakably.<p>



<p>



Coleman planted the seed for the free jazz movement of the 1960s, which in turn

gave rise to a school of European themeless improvisors, led by the guitarist

Derek Bailey and the saxophonist Evan Parker. Since 1965 Coleman has performed

on trumpet and violin in addition to alto and tenor saxophones, and several

young violinists have taken him as their model: for example, Billy Bang, whose

jaunty, anthemlike writing bespeaks his affection for Coleman. And for all

practical purposes, the idea of collective group improvisation, which has

reached an apex in the work of a number of groups affiliated with the

Chicago-based Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, began with

the partial liberation of bass and drums from chordal and timekeeping duties in

the first Ornette Coleman Quartet.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=5>I</font>F one listens closely for them, one can hear Colemanesque accents in the most

unlikely places: the maundering piano soliloquies of Keith Jarrett and the

bickering, simultaneous improvisations of young hard-boppers like Wynton and

Branford Marsalis. Yet for all that, Coleman's way has never really supplanted

Charlie Parker's as the lingua franca to jazz, as many hoped and others feared

it would.<p>



<p>



One reason could be that Coleman's low visibility has denied the jazz

avant-garde a figurehead. Since his debut at the Five Spot, Coleman has set a

price for concerts and recordings that reflects what he perceives to be his

artistic merit rather than his limited commercial appeal. Needless to say, he

has had very few takers. As a result, he performs only occasionally, and it is

difficult to avoid the conclusion that he bears some responsibility for his own

neglect.<p>



<p>



Just a few years ago it appeared that Coleman's star was on the rise again. In

1977 his former sidemen Cherry, Redman, Haden, and Blackwell formed a quartet

called Old and New Dreams. Coleman compositions, old and new, accounted for

roughly half of the group's repertoire. If the myth that Coleman had to be

physically present in order for his music to be played properly persisted in

some quarters, Old and New Dreams dispelled it once and for all. The band

played Coleman's music with a joy and a sense of purpose that bore witness to

Coleman's acuity as a composer. The success of Old and New Dreams showed that

the music that had once been both hailed and reviled as the wave of the future

had taken a firm enough hold in the past to inspire nostalgia.<p>



<p>



The rapture with which jazz audiences greeted the band's reinterpretation of

vintage Coleman owed something to the fact that Coleman himself had moved on to

other frontiers--appearing with two electric guitarists, two bass guitarists,

and two drummers in a band he called Prime Time. The group provided the working

model for a cryptic (and, one suspects, largely after-the-fact) theory of

tonality that Coleman called harmolodics. The theory held that instruments can

play together in different keys without becoming tuneless or exchanging the

heat of the blues for a frigid atonality. (As the critic Robert Palmer pointed

out in the magazine <I>The New York Rocker</I>, Coleman's music had always been

"harmolodic.") In practice the harmolodic theory functioned like a MacGuffin in

a Hitchcock film: if you could follow what it was all about, good for you; if

you couldn't, that wasn't going to hamper your enjoyment one iota. What

mattered more than any amount of theorizing was that Coleman was leading jazz

out of a stalemate, much as he had in 1959. He had succeeded in locating

indigenous jazz rhythms that play upon the reflexes of the body the way the

simultaneously bracing and relaxing polyrhythms of funk and New Wave

rock-and-roll do.<p>



<p>



Unlike most of the jazz musicians who embraced dance rhythms in the 1970s,

Coleman wasn't slumming or taking the path of least resistance in search of a

mass following. Nonetheless, a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent

in 1981, when he signed with Island Records and named Sid and Stanley Bernstein

(the former is the promoter who brought the Beatles to Shea Stadium) as his

managers. There is some disagreement among the principal parties about what

happened next, but Coleman released only one album on the Island label. In 1983

he severed his ties with the Bernstein agency and once more went into a partial

eclipse.<p>



Lately the task of shedding Coleman's light has fallen to Ulmer, Tacuma, and

Jackson. They have been no more successful than Coleman in attracting a mass

audience, despite a greater willingness to accommodate public tastes--and

despite reams of hype from the intellectual wing of the pop-music press. When

Coleman next emerges from the shadows, he may have discarded harmolodics in

favor of some other invention.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>I</font>N the final analysis, Coleman's failure to redefine jazz as decisively as many

predicted he would is more the result of the accelerated pace at which jazz was

evolving <I>before</I> he arrived in New York than of his lack of activity afterward.

During the fifty years prior to Coleman's debut a series of upheavals had taken

jazz far from its humble folk beginnings and made of it a codified art music.

It was as though jazz had imitated the evolution of European concert music in a

fraction of the time. Just as the term "classical music" has come to signify

European concert music of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,

the words "modern jazz" have become synonymous with the style of jazz

originally called bebop.<p>



<p>



With Ornette Coleman, jazz established its permanent avant-garde--a "new" that

would always remain new. If one measures a player's influence solely by the

number of imitators he spawns and veteran players who adopt aspects of his

style (the usual yardstick in jazz), Coleman finishes among his contemporaries

a distant third behind Davis and Coltrane. Yet his accomplishment seems somehow

greater than theirs. Davis and Coltrane showed which elements of free form the

jazz mainstream could absorb (modality, approximate harmonies, saxophone

glossolalia, the sixteenth note as a basic unit of measurement, the use of

auxiliary percussion and of horns once considered "exotic") and which elements

it finally could not (variable pitch, free meter, collective improvisation).

Coleman's early biography is replete with stories of musicians packing up their

instruments and leaving the bandstand when he tried to sit in. If Coleman now

showed up incognito at a jam session presided over by younger followers of

Parker, Davis, and Coltrane, chances are he would be given the cold shoulder.

Bebop seems to be invincible, though Coleman and other prophets without honor

continue to challenge its hegemony.<p>



<p>



The bop revolution of the 1940s was a successful coup d'etat. The revolution

that Ornette Coleman started is never wholly going to succeed or fail.

Coleman's revolution has proved to be permanent. Its skirmishes have marked the

emergence of jazz as a full-fledged modern art, with all of modernism's

dualities and contradictions.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<p>



<font size=5>N</font>O modern jazz record library is complete without the 

albums that Ornette Coleman recorded for Atlantic Records from 1959 to 

1961, including <I>The Shape of Jazz to Come</I> (SD1317), <I>Change of the 

Century</I> (SD1327), <I>This Is Our Music</I> (SD1353),<I>Free Jazz</I> (SD1364), 

Ornette!  (SD1378), and Ornette on Tenor (SD1394).  Although most of them 

remain in print, the question arises why Atlantic has never re-issued its 

Coleman material in chronological order, complete with unissued titles and 

alternate takes.  This seminal music merits such historical 

presentation.<p>



<p>



Coleman's recordings with Prime Time and its immediate precursors are 

<I>Dancing in Your Head</I> (A&amp;M Horizon SP722), <I>Body Mehta</I> 

(Artists House AH-1), and <I>Of Human Feelings</I> (Island/ Antilles 

AN-2001).  The group Old and New Dreams, which still exists as a part-time 

endeavor, has released three albums, including <I>Playing</I> (ECM-11205) and two 

titled <I>Old and New Dreams</I> on different labels (ECM-1-1154 and Black Saint 

BSR-0013).<p>



<p>



Other essential Coleman includes his album-length concerto for alto 

saxophone and orchestra, <I>The Skies of America</I> (Columbia KC-31562); 

his duets with the bassist Charlie Haden, <I>Soap Suds</I> (Artist House AH-6); 

and his best concert recordings, <I>The Ornette Coleman Trio Live at the 

Golden Circle, Volumes 1 &amp; 2</I> (Blue Note BST-84224 and BST-84225, 

available separately).<p>

Thereports were commissioned by the major networks, at a total cost of $1.5million, in response to congressional pressure; as a result of theirsponsorship, the networks will, presumably, be unable to distance themselvesfrom any thorny conclusions or recommendations. Instead of simply counting theviolent acts in a given show or time period--the approach historically taken bymedia-watchdog groups--the reports will evaluate qualitative issues such as theextent and nature of the violence, the motivation for and consequences of it,and the context and manner in which it is portrayed. Among the genres to beassessed are children's programs, prime-time shows, made-for-television andtheatrical movies, PBS programs, home video rentals, and video games.<h4>Health&amp; Safety</a></h4>September brings the opening of soccer season and a reminder that soccerinjuries can be more serious than simply a kick on the shin. The chief cause offatal injuries: falling goalposts, which have killed at least 21 people in theUnited States since 1979. Most of the accidents have involved unanchoredhomemade goals, including ones assembled by high school shop classes andcommunity businesses; they have prompted the U.S. Consumer Product SafetyCommission to issue new guidelines for the design, use, storage, and setup ofmovable goals. September <b>1</b>, a new Federal Aviation Administration ruleestablishing minimum combined experience levels for two pilots flying togethertakes effect. At least one crew member must have 75 or more hours of experienceflying the type of plane at hand. In addition, if one pilot has fewer than 100hours of flight time in that type of plane, the senior pilot must make alltakeoffs and landings in hazardous weather and at particularly hazardousairports.<h4>Environment</a></h4>September <b>1</b>, the largest wind-power plant in the United States outsideCalifornia goes into operation today. The 35-megawatt Windplant, in CulbersonCounty, Texas, is expected to provide 120,000 megawatt-hours annually to theLower Colorado River Authority and the city of Austin --enough to power 19Fenway Parks for a season. Most of the nation's approximately 16,000 windturbines are in California, but in at least 14 other states across the countrywind-power plants are now in operation, under construction, or planned. Recenttechnological advances have made the costs of operating wind farms comparableto those of running conventional fossil-fuel plants, and the industry predictsthat the cost of wind power will continue to drop. This year the federalgovernment allocated nearly $50 million to research and development on windenergy--an increase of 63 percent over 1994.<h4>Government</a></h4>September <b>1</b>, a Texas ban on the "canned hunting" of exotic animals--inwhich hunters kill a caged or just-released animal--takes effect today. Texasis the center of this activity, which generally involves animals of breedsnative to Africa and Asia but born and raised on Texas ranches or bought,usually indirectly, from zoos. Outfitters sell the opportunity to "hunt" theseanimals for as much as $10,000 each. <b>29</b>, starting today the Riegle-NealInterstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act takes effect, allowing anyadequately capitalized and managed bank holding company to acquire banks inother states. Ultimately the law will also allow banks to establish interstatebranches. Proponents of the act cite the potential convenience for consumerswho work or travel across state lines; they also argue that the act could helpto forestall a repeat of the bank failures of the 1980s, if enough banks expandgeographically and diversify their risks.<h4>Food</a></h4>September <b>14</b>, starting today the term "ice cream" takes on new meaning,as revisions to the Food and Drug Administration's definition of it go intoeffect. Ice milk will now be labeled "reduced-fat," "low-fat," or "nonfat" icecream; in addition, ice cream sweetened with anything other than nutritivecarbohydrate sweeteners (honey, sugar, corn syrup, and the like) must includethe sweetener in its name. The latter requirement will be in force for onlythree years, after which time consumers will presumably be savvy enough tocheck the ingredients list for artificial sweeteners. It applies to all typesof ice cream, giving rise to complaints about pending "label litter": shoppersmight well be confronted with "Reduced-fat goat-milk ice cream sweetened withNutraSweet and saccharin."<h4>TheSkies</a></h4>September <b>1-2</b>, just at midnight EDT the Moon passes near Jupiteroverhead. <b>8-9</b>, Full Moon, also known this month as the Fruit or DyingGrass Moon. Because this year it is slightly closer to the Autumnal Equinoxthan October's full Moon, it can also be called the Harvest Moon. <b>20</b>,Jupiter lies north of Antares, the bright red star at the heart of theconstellation Scorpius. <b>23</b>, at 8:14 A.M. EDT, the Autumnal Equinox:summer ends.<h4>75Years Ago</a></h4>Louis Bartlett, writing in the September, 1920, issue of <i>The AtlanticMonthly</i>: "It is being seen more and more clearly that the community as awhole is interested in the welfare of each individual, and that, as thecondition of one class improves, the condition of the entire community isbettered. We have not gone very far along this road, but the dependence of allupon each is being more clearly recognized each day. We see that causesoperating injuriously to one class will presently affect all. The world is inthe situation of the man who, when his wife had indigestion, took a pill, onthe sound theory that, having eaten the same thing, he would have theindigestion sooner or later."</blockquote><hr><img src="../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../home.htm"><img src="../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

	<H3>Lincoln and Abortion</H3>
	
	
	
	<font size=5>G</font>eorge McKenna's article <a href= "../95sep/abortion/abortion.htm">"On 
	Abortion: A Lincolnian 	Position"</a> (September <i>Atlantic</i>)
	accomplishes 	one important objective. 	It forces pro-choice supporters to acknowledge that abortion does involve the
	destruction of a potentially living person. It is a procedure that cannot be
	recommended lightly and should not be dismissed casually, even though
	McKenna's quotation from Christopher Hitchens that an abortion must "break
	some bones and rupture some organs" is a pro-life picture that does not apply
	to early abortions. I believe that pro-choice supporters should face the fact
	that we human beings, like all the other animals on this earth, are sometimes
	required to carry out distasteful, even immoral, actions if we are to
	survive. If we permitted cats, dogs, rats, mice, cockroaches, bacteria, and
	viruses to breed without limit, we could not survive. However, in using other
	living things for our purposes, we must always recognize, as Albert
	Schweitzer did, that the mosquito must be destroyed regretfully. Destroying a
	fetus may be necessary when birth-control methods are not available, but it
	should never be done casually. <p>

	In spite of the black-and-white positions taken by those on both sides of the
	abortion debate, the choice of an abortion almost always involves tradeoffs
	between greater and lesser negative effects. Very few people would refuse an
	abortion to a woman about whom the best medical opinion was that carrying the
	fetus to term would kill her and most likely the fetus as well. Few would
	refuse an abortion to a woman who was carrying a grievously deformed fetus.
	Probably a minority would refuse an abortion to a woman who was pregnant as
	the result of forcible rape or incest. On the other hand, probably the
	majority would prefer to refuse an abortion if a woman wanted a son but was
	carrying a female fetus. In every situation where a decision is made to have
	an abortion or not, the welfare of the woman must be weighed against the
	welfare of the embryo or fetus. Often the welfare of the man involved or of
	other family members must be taken into account.<p>

	I am unhesitatingly and unapologetically pro-choice, because I believe that women
	pay the major price for child bearing and child-rearing. As a society, we all
	pay the price for unwanted children--in the form of welfare payments, social
	efforts to assist abused children, the impact on society of dysfunctional
	adults who were poorly nurtured children, and much more.<p>

	George McKenna claims that abortion advocates are afraid to speak of what
	they support, but he neglects the fact that many abortion advocates favor
	just what they say they favor, which is <i>reproductive choice</i>, broadly
	defined. This entails access to birth control, protection from rape and abuse
	by a spouse or partner, education about their bodies and human sexuality,
	and, yes--sometimes--access to safe, legal abortion. Any abortion advocate
	with any sense would rather prevent a pregnancy than end it with an abortion,
	but until a whole range of social changes come into being--including easy
	availability of birth control, a reduction in our consumer society's
	obsession with selling things with sex, and a significant reduction in the
	risk for many women of violent reprisal from their mates if they refuse
	sex--that will not be possible in many cases.<p>

	The Netherlands has attained the lowest abortion rate in the Western world
	and, note this, also the lowest percentage of unwanted babies (two percent),
	thus making politicking superfluous. These results were achieved in good
	measure by introducing at the elementary school level the subject of sex
	organs as a "natural" within the biology sequence--at an age when undesirable
	reaction is not likely. In high school, as part of their brand of social
	studies, comes a look at sexual behavior and how to handle it. About thirty
	years ago Denmark took the lead in this matter, and a significant number of
	our own schools are following suit. If this does not show the desired results
	in the United States, we'd better find out why. One can argue that such a
	curriculum may lead to increased promiscuity. Even if that is so, it is for
	the nation's health the lesser, by far, of the two evils. I, for one, believe
	that promiscuity, in particular in our inner cities, can be successfully
	addressed in schools only after basic sex education.<p>

	George McKenna's analysis would be more profound if he acknowledged that
	abortion is morally quite different from slavery. Even if one believes that
	an unborn child has a right to life, is it just that that right (and the
	interests of society in protecting that right) should impose such a
	potentially devastating burden on the mother? Can we so clearly conclude that
	abortion is wrong--as we can indeed about slavery--when the impact of
	carrying an unwanted child to term can be as life-threatening and as abusive
	of the mother as slavery itself?<p>

	Though probably right in principle, "tolerate, restrict, discourage" can work
	--and be remotely fair--only when democracy replaces hypocrisy. This country
	must enforce its statutory-rape laws, fund welfare and Head Start programs,
	track down deadbeat dads, and piece together its educational system. Until
	then I, for one, will continue to argue and vote strongly pro-choice, even
	though ideally I would support George McKenna's well-charted middle ground.
	Frankly, abortion is less wrong than the status quo, and is positively rosy
	compared with the status quo that would be born if abortion were illegal.<p>

	The moral premise of George McKenna's essay is that "abortion is troubling
	because it is a killing process." As a beginning of the candor and clarity
	McKenna calls for, it's worth trying to specify just why killing is wrong.
	What does it mean to say that life is sacred? Few people advocate compulsory
	vegetarianism; for most of us, only human life is sacred. What is the
	difference between human and nonhuman life? Human beings have ideas,
	passions, desires, hopes, memories, expectations, intentions--that is,
	feelings and mental experiences of a complexity and intensity apparently not
	found in other species. These feelings and thoughts are inestimably precious;
	they make life worth living. Having them is arguably what "being human"
	means. When a human creature stops having them--through brain death or some
	other irreparable calamity--we don't, in practice, consider him or her fully
	human any longer; and whether we deny or accord such creatures any further
	life depends not on their wishes--they have none--but on their families' and
	caretakers' wishes.<p>

	A fetus does not have ideas, passions, desires, hopes, memories, expectations, or
	intentions. As far as I know, no one claims otherwise, even those who are
	certain that a fetus is a person (whatever they may mean). A three-month-old
	fetus weighs one ounce. A six-month-old fetus weighs twenty-eight ounces. It
	does not have neurotransmitters, myelinated nerve fibers, or a
	well-articulated cerebral cortex. As a result, it has no sensations of any
	complexity and no awareness of itself. Late in pregnancy the fetus may
	perhaps feel pain, but certainly less intense and exquisite pain than many
	adult mammals, whom we annually slaughter by the hundreds of millions for
	reasons far less urgent than those of women seeking abortions. Why, then,
	might anyone believe that the life of a fetus is sacred?<p>

	I can imagine three reasons. First, its parents cherish hopes for it and would
	suffer greatly if it died. But these fetuses--they are the large
	majority--are not in any danger; on the contrary, they are cared for with all
	the resources the free market allows them. Second, it receives from God an
	immaterial, immortal soul at the moment of conception. McKenna should not
	underestimate how many people believe that this is why an unwanted fetus has
	a right to life, and thus to what extent the outlawing of abortion would be
	religiously motivated. Third, a fetus, though it is not a person, is a
	<i>potential </i>person. If it survives, it will eventually have ideas,
	passions, desires, etc.--will eventually become an actual person. Everyone
	can agree on this, but what follows from it? As far as I can see, nothing. It
	is arbitrary to restrict potential personhood to fetuses: every unfertilized
	ovum--for that matter, every sexual stirring--is, in strict logic, a
	potential person. <p>

	Nowhere in his article does George McKenna deal with the woman who is
	pregnant by mistake, through a contraceptive malfunction or as a result of
	rape or incest, or is carrying a genetically deformed fetus, is too young to
	mother, or is mentally ill. I have worked with mentally ill women who do not
	know they are pregnant, or by whom, and whose children are at very high risk
	for psychosis themselves. McKenna simply does not mention the many reasons
	for which a woman seeks an abortion, and his only reference to the woman as a
	person refers to widening "the range of choices available to women in crisis
	pregnancies." The reason abortion is a problem is that there are ethical
	reasons for abortion.<p>

	George McKenna has missed the point. Abortion was made socially acceptable
	the first time a woman took a birth-control pill without knowing that one of
	its modes of action was to kill a tiny human being. From that point forward
	society strode down the treacherous path that today enables medical
	professionals to promote methotrexate/misoprostol and other chemical
	cocktails.<p>

	Abortion is a crime, and because it kills someone each and every time it occurs,
	the vast majority of pro-life Americans do not desire that it merely be
	<i>contained</i>! As Americans, we want to see any act that takes the life of
	a fellow human being stopped--and abortion takes a human being's life.<p>

	Although I cannot agree completely with George McKenna's suggestion on how
	best to address the moral catastrophe of widespread abortion in the United
	States, I would like to commend <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> for having the
	courage to raise the issue at all. The mainstream media in this country are
	so unfailingly monotonous in taking a pro-abortion position that anyone who
	dares publish another point of view deserves to be recognized.<p>

	The battle we fight as supporters of life is not only against abortion but, more
	important, a battle for the dignity of all human life. Human beings, whether
	young or old, healthy or infirm, completely sound in mind and limb or living
	with a handicap, deserve from every civilized nation the protection of at
	least the most basic of their human rights--the right to life. This is the
	highest and most essential of the truths that American leaders first declared
	self-evident, and yet America and other "modern" nations stand in dire danger
	of forgetting it. If the parties supporting abortion around the world win in
	this struggle, they will win a victory for the vilest of tyrannies; for if,
	as Lincoln argued, it is despotic for one human being to own the labor of
	another, how much more so is it for one human being to own the life or death
	of another?<p>

	After studying George McKenna's article, I have concluded that it is simply
	another round in the "pro-life" propaganda war, and not the thoughtful
	monograph that it purports to be.<p>

	<i>George McKenna replies:</i><p>
	

	I am impressed by the range of respondents to my article--all the way from
	Judie Brown, who apparently wants an immediate ban not only on abortion but
	on all birth-control pills, to Daniel Kline, who puts unborn children in the
	same category as "cats, dogs, rats, mice, cockroaches, bacteria, and
	viruses." Somewhere in the middle, closer to my position, is Father Matthew
	Habiger, whose supportive letter I appreciate. George Scialabba says that
	fetuses are not really human because they don't have "ideas, passions,
	desires, hopes, memories, expectations, intentions." It seems unlikely that
	an <i>already-born</i> baby could jump all those hurdles, and I fear the
	result if all Americans in sanatoriums and nursing homes were given such a
	rigorous test of personhood.<p>

	Some correspondents (Daniel Kline, Colleen Cullinan, Lucas VanHilst) stress birth
	control and sex education as the best means of making abortion rare. These
	have been widely available in this country for more than a quarter of a
	century, with meager results. Some sex-ed programs--those stressing
	abstinence--have had modest successes, but "comprehensive" programs, like the
	one adopted in New Jersey fifteen years ago, have produced no measurable
	effects, unless we consider as an effect the 16 percent increase in
	illegitimate births in New Jersey since 1980. (See Barbara Dafoe Whitehead,
	"The Failure of Sex Education," October, 1994, <i>Atlantic</i>.)
	Condom-distribution programs have also had scant success. A 1991 study of
	school-based birth-control clinics by the Alan Guttmacher Institute (the
	research arm of Planned Parenthood) concluded that "none of the clinics had a
	statistically significant effect on school-wide pregnancy rates." Similar
	results emerged from another Guttmacher study published in 1993.<p>

	These are facts. But facts may not be important to everyone in the abortion
	debate. Imelda McKercher apparently doesn't care how thoughtfully pro-lifers
	develop their arguments or couch their language--she just <i>knows</i> they
	are guilty of "vicious fanaticism." The facts are that pro-life organizations
	staff and support more than 3,400 pregnancy-service centers nationwide to
	assist women and children before <i>and after</i> birth, and the single
	largest private provider of social services to women and children in the
	United States is a pro-life organization called the Catholic Church.<p>

<font size=5>A</font>natol Lieven's article "A New Iron Curtain" (January <i>Atlantic</i>) is a
throwback to the Cold War. As during the age of Stalinism, Lieven wants to
disenfranchise (to shut them up) the peoples in the zone between Russia and
Europe. Lieven blames the victims of imperialism, not the imperialists. For
him, the relationship between Russia and the West is one of geo- and power
politics. With friends like Anatol Lieven, Russia needs no enemies. It was
Russian ideology and imperialism living beyond their means, not Western
weapons, conspiracy, or money, that bankrupted the Soviet Union. Instead of
underwriting the Russian "right" to keep Russia's neighbors economically
backward--and thus, also, Russia poor--a true friend would teach Russians
moderation. Lieven is absolutely wrong in saying that Russians do not threaten
their neighbors. They threaten even the West. The problem is that the threats,
implied or direct, keep Western capital out of Eastern Europe, especially
Ukraine and the Baltics. Nothing is gained by pretending that Russia is not
economically backward or that the Russian state (hiding behind the "right to
security") over the centuries has not committed horrendous atrocities on the
peoples of Eastern Europe. A truly objective analyst of post-Soviet Eastern
Europe would draw a difference between imperial states and colonized peoples.<p>

Andrew Ezergailis<br>
<i>Professor of Russian History<br>Ithaca College<br>Ithaca, N.Y.</i><p>

<i></i> <font size=5>A</font>natol Lieven characterizes Westerners who support the expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization as political opportunists gunning for the
Polish vote or as anti-Russian propagandists nostalgic for the Cold War. In so
doing he squanders center court in <i>The Atlantic Monthly </i>on a bout with a
straw man. Lieven demonstrates beyond any doubt that all Russian politicians
oppose NATO's eastward enlargement and will hint at catastrophic consequences
to dissuade the alliance from going ahead with its plans. Why is this the least
bit surprising or revealing? In today's wounded, disillusioned Russia, no
political figure with an ounce of savvy would miss a chance to impugn the
motives of an alliance that stood in opposition to the motherland for four
decades. If NATO does undertake a limited expansion, however, Russian leaders
will have no choice but to accept it. Soon thereafter they will (quietly,
perhaps) come to value it. In an enlarged NATO, Germany will have no need to
pursue an independent security strategy in central Europe, the smaller nations
of the region will be far less inclined to pick fights among themselves, and
stable democracies and small, defensive armed forces under civilian control
will be the norm to Russia's west. Lieven claims that an honest, coherent
discussion in the West of the necessity for expansion has not occurred. Perhaps
he was just not aware of it.<p>

Gary L. Geipel<br>
<i>Indianapolis, Ind.</i><p>

<i>Anatol Lieven replies:</i><p>

<i></i><font size=5>A</font>ndrew Ezergailis writes that I am "underwriting 
the Russian 'right' to
keep Russia's neighbors economically backward." This is a willful
misrepresentation of my position. As I wrote in my article, I am strongly in
favor of the earliest possible membership in the European Union for both the
Balts and the Visegrad countries. As I also wrote, one reason I oppose NATO
expansion at present is precisely that I believe that the Western European
governments are using it to distract the Eastern Europeans from what would be
for them a much bigger prize. This is, of course, because the Western Europeans
are terrified, owing to the internal changes they would have to carry out
(reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, for example) in order to extend the
European Union to the east.<p>

Concerning Professor Ezergailis's suggestion that a supposed Russian security
threat to Eastern Europe is keeping Western investment from the region, there
is no evidence either for a real threat or for the myth of its having any
effect on Western businessmen. Relations between Russia and Estonia have
sometimes been strained in recent years, but this has not prevented Western
capital from helping to make Estonia one of the great economic success stories
of Eastern Europe. If other countries have lagged behind, it has been for their
own internal reasons. <p>

As for Gary Geipel, the differences between us are probably in the end rather
slight. Like him, I strongly support the integration of Eastern and Western
Europe, and I do not oppose the idea of NATO expansion at some stage in the
future; I just don't see the need for it right now, when Russians are at their
most nervous and resentful. I honestly believe that if we proceed cautiously,
we can have both integration and a reasonably co-operative Russia. What's the
flaming hurry?<p>

<p>

<A NAME="Washington's Character"><h3>Washington's Character</A></h3><p>

<font size=5>A</font>mazing! Never mind that today discussions about ethnic and racial matters are
commonplace, and that historians, looking to America's past, emphasize those
themes. You run a piece ("A Man on Horseback,"by Richard Brookhiser, January
<i>Atlantic</i>) on "the human qualities of George Washington, and what they
say about 'character'"--a piece that utters not a word about the man's owning
scores of slaves.<p>

Not that the author didn't provide himself with opportunities. The Roman models
for American republicans, after all, also owned slaves, and one wonders whether
or not a man "tremendous in his wrath" ever visited that temper on his human
chattel. Which of those 110 "Rules of Civility" did Washington observe when
dealing with his slaves? If he avoided killing "vermin, or fleas, lice, ticks,
etc. in the sight of others," did he also forbear mistreating the people who
were his property, within or without the sight of others? And if manners "meant
the graceful acknowledgment of others across social distances," how mannerly
was he across the social gap between master and slave?<p>

John D. Milligan<br>
<i>Buffalo, N.Y.</i><p>

<i>Richard Brookhiser replies:</i><p>

<i></i><font size=5>A</font>nyone who writes about George Washington has to be mindful of his
record of slave-owning. He certainly was. In the last twenty years of his life
the topic was seldom far from his thoughts. He went so far as to propose
selling Mount Vernon and hiring out its freed slaves as laborers. (The plan
came to nothing, because there were no takers for a property with such bad
soil.) He ended up freeing all his slaves in his will--something no other
slave-owning President, including Jefferson, did. I discuss these and other
aspects of Washington's slave-owning in my book <i>Founding Father</i>, from
which the article was drawn.<p>

<p>
<A NAME="A French Mirror"><H3>A French Mirror</H3></A>
<p>

<font size=5>H</font>ans Koning's article "A French Mirror" (December <i>Atlantic</i>) makes the
case that the French are doing a good job of preparing for the future. Although
I agree that the French have done well at preserving towns and cities and
building an effective public-transportation system, most evidence I gathered
from a year spent in France is that they are running themselves into a ditch.<p>

Perhaps Koning has mistaken the lavish rhetoric of French public officials for
vision. It is not. A 12 percent unemployment rate, a six percent federal
deficit, shrinking disposable incomes, and sharpening ethnic strife suggest
that France hasn't done a great job of looking ahead. The public school system
is rigorous but negative and famously inflexible. Universities, while free, are
training for jobs and a society that no longer exist. Retraining and continuing
education are mostly nonexistent.<p>

I must admit that it was refreshing--at least for a while--to live in a nation
where the bottom line and the "private sector can do everything" mania are not
running amok. But France's imperial executive bureaucracy, which continues to
invest heavily in lost jobs to the detriment of new opportunities, is hardly
more creative than our new revolutionaries who sing their age-old fantasies in
dreary chorus. The troubles of our era call for innovative methods that neither
ideologues here nor bureaucratic royalty there seems capable of generating.
Though opposite in their prescriptions, both finally have one answer to all
evils: more of the same.<p>

David Pezzullo<br>
<i>Baltimore, Md.</i><p>

<i></i><font size=5>I</font>, too, spent a number of months in France last year, but I came away
with a very different view of <i>la vie fran&ccedil;aise</i>. Hans Koning's
romantic claptrap about a noble and benevolent welfare state must result from
drinking too much <i>vin ordinaire </i>at Les Deux Magots. If a caf&eacute; or
magazine or movie is any good, it ought not to need government help,
<i>n'est-ce pas </i>? And although France's telephone system may be as good as
ours, it costs four times as much to make a call--or to buy gas or to travel.
The high costs debilitate everyone.<p>

For all of France's wonderful buildings, glorious past, and <i>sens
civique</i>, the nation is riven by social warfare and populated by a citizenry
that struggles to put protein into its diet because of misguided agricultural
programs, is beggared by an outdated retail pricing framework that makes it
hard to buy decent clothing, and has its aspirations limited by an education
system that still employs <i>dict&eacute;e</i>--learning by rote--rather than
problem-solving as its organizing principle. Gripped by a stubborn recession,
venal scandals, bitter strikes, and intractable unemployment, daily life in
most of the nation is very different from the <i>socialiste </i>utopia that
Koning describes.<p>

Jeffrey S. Young<br>
<i>Rescue, Calif.</i><p>

<i></i><font size=5>H</font>ans Koning managed to identify all the worst aspects of France in his
article "A French Mirror." France is a wonderful place in spite of its
oppressive civil-service elitism--not because of it.<p>

The vibrant and growing use of personal computers in the United States is far
superior both qualitatively and quantitatively to anything in France. Yet
Koning is impressed by the second-rate Minitel hardware because the government
gave millions of Minitels away. He seems dazzled by the huge number of nuclear
reactors in France--although they are considered a blot on the landscape
anywhere else--because they were built by government instead of private
utilities. In France an elite of politicians and civil servants, trained in a
handful of elitist colleges in Paris and living in luxury apartments paid for
by French taxpayers, take as many decisions as possible out of the hands of
French citizens and into their own. Public-employee unions and college
students--civil servants in training--extort money from the public through
intimidating strikes and by rioting in the streets. It was oppressive under
Louis XIV, it was oppressive under the Terror and both Napoleons, and it is
still oppressive under Gaullists or socialists. I'll take the "icy wind of our
sacred marketplace" over that anytime.<p>

Richard E. Ralston<br>
<i>Marina del Rey, Calif.</i><p>

<i></i> <font size=5>"A</font> French Mirror" is a paean to French government intervention in
everything from technology to culture. Unfortunately, the article is factually
incorrect and its logic is faulty. The French national railroad (SNCF) is not
financially self-supporting, as Hans Koning claims. It is running an annual
deficit of $2.4 billion (<i>New York Times</i>, December 8, 1995). It is no
more self-supporting than the government-planned <i>Concorde</i>, which has
never earned a profit. France's budget deficits have ballooned in the 1990s,
its currency has fluctuated widely, and interest rates are high, thus driving
down economic growth. The Minitels that Koning admires are completely
outclassed by the number of services, the number of subscribers, and the global
reach of the Internet in this country. When was the last time the author used a
French computer or even saw one? He says that France, unlike the United States,
is planning for the twenty-first century. The premier industries in the
twenty-first century, everyone agrees, will be computers, telecommunications,
and biotechnology. The United States is the acknowledged world leader and
pacesetter in each of these fields. The ten largest software companies in the
world are in the United States. These industries have been driven primarily by
entrepreneurship in a free-market economy. Silicon Valley is the envy of the
world. President Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand in the early 1980s came to the San
Francisco Bay Area to look at Silicon Valley and went home vowing to make it
easier to start companies in France. And this from a socialist President who
had nationalized many French companies when he came to power. The French are
now trying, desperately, to privatize major industries, such as autos and
computers. When Renault (which is currently state-owned) tried to merge with
Volvo, Volvo shareholders vociferously declined, and the deal fell through.<p>

<u>With the recent upheavals, if the French are not able to cut their
deficits, they will not be able to join the common European currency, and will
thus continue to cede monetary control to the Bundesbank and ensure their
inevitable decline. Koning's recommendations for the United States will be no
more successful in this country than they are in France.</u><p>

<b><u></u></b>Donald F. DuBois<br>
<i>Palo Alto, Calif.</i><p>

<i></i><font size=5>H</font>ans Koning's piece came out with less than perfect timing, just as a
major clash over the future of the French state was erupting in the streets of
Paris. The causes and results of December's strikes point up the weaknesses in
his argument. Where Koning sees apolitical and farsighted civil servants
keeping a firm grip on the tiller of the ship of state, millions of French
citizens see a clubby and cliquish group of elitists dictating economic policy
to them. On more than one occasion French friends have told me that it is
America's <i>lack </i>of just such a class of "<i>&eacute;narques</i>"
(graduates of the ultra-elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration) that makes our
democracy more responsive to the wishes of its citizenry.<p>

Not that the strikers should be glorified either: "intransigence" seemed to be
the watchword among the national-railway employees in the most recent conflict.
Instead of focusing on <i>sens civique</i>, Koning would have done well to
elaborate on the force that sometimes directly opposes it, namely the
hyperdeveloped French sense of <i>solidarit&eacute;</i>. At its best a French
strike can permit a specific group to manifest its unity in the face of a
reticent or aggressive government, but the window-smashing, rock-throwing, and
tire-burning of recent major strikes do not speak well of the <i>sens civique
</i>of certain fishermen, farmers, truck drivers, and airline employees.<p>

Mark Burde<br>
<i>St. Louis, Mo.</i><p>

<i>Hans Koning replies:</i><p>

<font size=5>I</font> wrote "A French Mirror" to hold up a mirror of alternatives to our present
policies; nowhere did I suggest that France has created a utopia. What France
has is an active civic sense. Disposable incomes in France are not shrinking
but (in the opinion of the government) increasing too much. I do not know what
it means to call the public school system "negative"; it is blissfully not
bowing to the suggestions for more practicality--which usually amount to public
relations and "communications" nonsense instead of serious studies. Les Deux
Magots, unfortunately, does not serve <i>vin ordinaire</i>, only very expensive
stuff. Jeffrey Young informs us that if a magazine or movie is any good, it has
no need for public funds. <i>Sacra simplicitas</i>--or, if you prefer, you must
be kidding! The bad is driving out the good at increasing speed, but public
money may save the good.<p>

When the French strikes peaked in December, I wondered what this would do to my
article. Events may play tricks on writers for a monthly, but in this case they
confirmed my report. The French strikes were to<i> protect</i> certain social
achievements that a new government (which came into power after my article was
written) tried to undo, contrary to its election-campaign promises. Rather than
being "intimidating" or leading to "rioting in the streets," they were
supported by an unusually large majority of the population, 60-70 percent,
right through those weeks of hardship. <p>

In talking about elitist civil servants, Mark Burde ignores the unprecedentedly
sharp turn to the right that Jacques Chirac's government tried (it is now
having apologetic second thoughts). I was lucky enough to predict strife, but
there was no rock-throwing or tire-burning. Those are the weapons of Western
Europe's farmers and fishermen, who have no strike option.<p>

Here is the crux of the matter, missed by these correspondents. Of course there
is a social war in France. There is a social war in every country. The idea
that the great industrialists and bankers have the selfsame interests as the
average citizen is hype that no democratic country but the United States takes
seriously. The <i>sens civique</i> is precisely what made such a large majority
support the striking railroad workers, postal workers, and Metro drivers. After
the strikes a trade-union leader said, "We do not want to live like
Anglo-Saxons"--that is, in an "individualism without borders." I think the polls
begin to show that neither Anglo-Saxons nor Americans generally want "to live
like Anglo-Saxons."<p>

Donald DuBois may have been too angry to read carefully. I wrote not that the
national railroad was self-supporting but  that the TGV, the high-speed train,
is "more than self-supporting." So it is. It helps to reduce the deficit of the
SNCF. Of course the Minitels, a low-cost and now fifteen-year-old service, are
no match for the Internet, although they do provide a number of services still
not available in the United States--for example, safe shopping (credit-card
verification takes place in the terminal and does not go online). France
Telecom says that the Minitel still satisfies most people most of the time (two
billion calls in 1995, with more than a billion dollars' worth of business),
but that the company is now in the process of becoming a provider of Internet
services, not competing with Minitel but "as a complementary service." The
Internet will be available nationwide for the price of a local call, because it
will use the points of access already established to the Transpac network for
the Minitel.<p>

<p>
<A NAME="Strawberry Fields"><H3>Strawberry Fields</H3></A>
<p>

<font size=5>"T</font>he Strawberry Fields" (November <i>Atlantic</i>) contains a glaring error:
Eric Schlosser's gratuitous statements that Governor Pete Wilson has "relaxed
enforcement of the state's tough labor laws," and that "growers avoided
prosecution for workplace violations by hiding behind the legal fiction that
labor contractors and sharecroppers were the actual employers of migrants."
Schlosser thus attempts to attribute illegal sharecropping arrangements to
inaction on the part of the Department of Industrial Relations, the Division of
Labor Standards Enforcement, and this administration.<p>

Curiously, earlier in the piece Schlosser and his sources cite with approval
the legal action recently undertaken by this office involving one such
sharecropping arrangement by Kirk Produce Company, and also the seminal 1989
California Supreme Court case involving similar issues, <i>S. G. Borello &amp;
Sons </i>v.<i> Department of Industrial Relations</i>. In both cases the
division took the position that the evidence presented made the grower the true
employer of record, and the sharecropper merely an agent or employee.<p>

One cannot have it both ways. If, as Schlosser concludes, we have "relaxed
enforcement" of the state's labor laws, how can he explain that each of these
cases was originally investigated and brought to court by this division? The
Kirk Produce<i> </i>case was brought by the division under the aegis of the
Targeted Industries Partnership Program (TIPP), through which the division
participates in the vigorous enforcement of state and federal labor laws in the
garment-manufacturing and agricultural industries. Last August this agency led
a team of state, federal, and local authorities to free seventy-two Thai
workers from a garment- manufacturing "slaveshop" in El Monte, California.<p>

TIPP was one of Governor Wilson's program initiatives to improve enforcement
and avoid duplication of effort by state and federal agencies charged with
enforcing labor standards in the workplace. Through a combination of vigorous
enforcement and preventive outreach educational efforts the program has
achieved a remarkable degree of compliance in the agricultural industry.<p>

Jose Millan<br>
<i>Interim State Labor Commissioner</i><br>
<i>Division of Labor Standards Enforcement</i><br>
<i>San Francisco, Calif.</i><p>

<i>Eric Schlosser replies:</i><p>

<font size=5>J</font>ose Millan's claim that TIPP "has achieved a remarkable degree of compliance"
is itself remarkable. TIPP has managed to stem some violations that are easily
observed by inspectors in the field, such as the absence of drinking water and
of portable toilets. But it has been much less successful at uncovering
systematic wage theft. During the first two years of its existence, in a state
with nearly one million farm workers, TIPP issued just twenty-nine citations
for violations of the minimum-wage law.<p>

The Borello case was set in motion by a state labor examiner who drove past a
pickle field, noticed blatant violations of the labor code, and felt so enraged
that he issued a citation on the spot, ignoring the Division of Labor Standards
Enforcement's policy not to target sharecropping. The division pursued the
Borello case halfheartedly, calling no witnesses at the initial hearing and not
even bothering to contest an appeals-court decision in favor of the grower. The
California Supreme Court chose entirely on its own initiative to review the
case, a judicial prerogative that is rarely exercised.<p>

Governor Wilson's administration does, however, deserve some credit for its
efforts to halt illegal sharecropping in the strawberry industry. The current
U.S. Department of Labor has done little to enforce the Fair Labor Standards
Act in California agriculture. The federal government has the power, under
FLSA, to seize agricultural goods harvested by workers paid less than minimum
wage--a power that, if exercised, would do a great deal of good.<p>


<A NAME="Advice &amp; Consent"><H3>Advice &amp; Consent</H3></A>
<p>

<font size=5>T</font>hanks for Paul Gagnon's thoughtful critique of current American education,
"What Should Children Learn?" (December <i>Atlantic</i>). One need only become
familiar with Victorian history to recognize the defining effect the Industrial
Revolution had upon its and our times. History witnessed the celerity with
which the machine, in all its diverse manifestations, shrank the world and
consolidated power into the hands of those few who understood its meaning. The
ensuing luxuries, on one hand, and dislocations, on the other, set a
sociopolitical order that lingers today. While the unwise may dismiss the need
for deep inquiry into this period and its aftermath--in favor, perhaps, of the
customs and enterprises of the Tlingit Indians (this is actually one of the
study subjects of my fifth grader)--they will find themselves unprepared for
the vicissitudes that are upon us as the Information Revolution unfolds.
Barbara Tuchman's <i>The Proud Tower</i> can serve as an allegory for the
current situation, wherein the informational haves not only eclipse the
political power but also determine the destiny of the have-nots.<p>
