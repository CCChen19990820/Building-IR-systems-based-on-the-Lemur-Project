  Quotes of the Day
	"The extent of human rights abuses associated with armed conflict, as well
as the  increasingly sophisticated technological environment, means that
Amnesty International has to intensify its work to address the conduct of
security forces, and their international partners. When transfers of
equipment, technology, or training can reasonably be assumed to contribute
to human rights abuses, Amnesty International Campaigns against them.
	...Legislation and regulations should be established at national and
international level. These should prohibit any transfer of military,
security or police equipment, technology, training or personnel -- as well
as financial and logistical support for such transfers -- unless it can be
reasonably demonstrated that such transfers will not contribute to grave
human rights violations. These laws and regulations should ensure that the
human rights situation in the receiving country is taken into consideration
before any decision to approve a transfer. The supplier government should
take responsibility for the use of transfers through regular monitoring and
legally binding "end-user certificates" citing human rights criteria. All
information necessary to allow the country's legislative assembly to
exercise proper control over the implementation of the law should be
supplied and all transfers should be publicly disclosed in advance."
		-- Amnesty International Report 1996, pp. 17-18

	Blowback
	"All through 1985, we poured weapons into Afghanistan--heavy machine guns,
SA-7s, and the Oerlikon antiaircraft cannons, all of which began to produce
increasing aircraft losses for the Soviets. In addition to large increases
in weapons, we improved the logistics base and our ability to bring the
weapons, ammunition, food, and clothing to those inside Afghanistan--laying
the basis for the extraordinary Mujahedin success in 1986 and 1987. (This
included importing thousands of Chinese mules in Afghanistan to transport
weapons. We could not find enough suitable U.S. mules to meet our needs.)
Funds for 1986 were increased by more than $125 million over 1985, to be
used to buy many more weapons of all kinds.
	It was during this period that we began to learn of a significant increase
in the number of Arab nationals from other countries who had traveled to
Afghanistan to fight in the Holy War against the Soviets. They came from
Syria, Iraq, Algeria, and elsewhere, and most fought with the Islamic
fundamentalist Muj groups, particularly that headed by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf.
We examined ways to increase their participation, perhaps in the form of
some sort of "international brigade," but nothing came of it. Years later,
these fundamentalist fighters trained by the Mujahedin in Afghanistan would
begin to show up around the world, from the Middle East to New York City,
still fighting their Holy War--only now including the United States among
their enemies. Our mission was to push the Soviets out of Afghanistan. We
expected post-Soviet Afghanistan to be ugly, but never considered that it
would become a haven for terrorists operating worldwide."
From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How
They Won The Cold War, Robert M. Gates (Former Director of the Central
Intelligence Agency) p. 349.

	Are you listening, Joel Johnson?
	"The Board finds that U.S. arms transfer policy can and should be developed
and executed separately from issues of maintenance of the defense industrial
base, which we believe are better handled by specific DoD industrial base
policy. We do not believe that arms sales that would be rejected on the
basis of foreign policy and national security considerations should be
approved simply to preserve jobs or keep a production line open. The Board
believes it is essential that the U.S. government takes steps to make this
policy clear at home and abroad."  (Pp. 15-16)
	AND
	"The Board rejects any notion that stepping back from well-conceived arms
restraint policies is the way to ensure the health of our defense industrial
base. The radical restructuring and adjustment to much smaller markets in
the world's defense industries will, as the RAND and other studies document,
continue in the foreseeable future. The export market is much too small to
offset the overall decline in defense procurement. Hence, the existence of
export sales opportunities for U.S. firms, while obviously valuable inn
preserving jobs and production lines in many cases, will not be sufficient
to allow the affected companies to forgo the downsizing required for their
survival."

..... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... 

From:      A.Malten@net.HCC.nl (Ak Malten)

Subject:   Het ICJ staat onder druk 

Het Internationaal Gerechtshof staat onder druk.

In december 1994, heeft de Algemene Vergadering van de UN 
(UNGA), ondanks de weerstand van de NATO Kernwapen Staten een 
resolutie aanvaard waarin het Internationaal Gerechtshof (ICJ) 
dringend gevraagd werd een uitspraak te doen over de vraag: "Is 
het dreigen met -- of gebruik van Kernwapens in elke situatie 
toegestaan onder internationaal recht?" 
Tijdens de publieke hoorzittingen afgelopen november hebben 16 
Anti-Kernwapen Staten nog meer druk van de USA, de UK en 
Frankrijk weerstaan en hebben goed onderbouwde argumenten voor 
het illegaal zijn van Kernwapens naar voren gebracht.  
China is niet verschenen en de overige Kernwapen Staten konden 
alleen Duitsland en Italie overhalen om in hun voordeel te 
getuigen.  

Het World Court Project (WCP) wacht samen met andere 
Vredesgroepen, en ook Milieugroepen op de beslissing van het 
Internationaal Gerechtshof over bovenstaande vraag. Het is 
misschien wel de belangrijkste zaak, waarover het Internationaal 
Gerechtshof in haar bestaan, een uitspraak zal doen.  Een 
uitspraak, die nu toch wel verwacht zou mogen worden. Eerst werd 
deze uitspraak verwacht in Maart, daarna in Mei en nou zijn er 
aanwijzingen dat het wel eind Juni kan worden; net voor de 
sluiting van het hof, vanwege haar zomerreces.  
 
Een legitieme reden hiervoor is dat het Internationaal 
Gerechtshof zeer zeker erg hard aan het werk is aan de Bosnie-
Joegoslavie-zaak.  Maar er blijken ook andere reden te bestaan 
die ons (Groepen binnen het Abolition 2000 netwerk, waaronder 
WCP en GANA) grote zorgen baren.  

1. Op een conferentie in Edinburgh van de International Law 
Association hebben we op 10 mei van Sir Robert Jennings (oud 
president van het Internationaal Gerechtshof te Den Haag) te 
horen gekregen dat het Internationaal Gerechtshof in financiele 
moeilijkheden is. Hij waarschuwde dat het Internationaal 
Gerechtshof gesloten werd.  Hij gaf aan dat het complete 
secretariaat van het Internationaal Gerechtshof naar huis 
gestuurd is; en het aantal vertalers (toch al onderbemand) nog 
verder is teruggebracht.  Hij vroeg iedereen zijn invloed aan te 
wenden om het hof te beschermen, speciaal op het moment dat het 
hof bezig is een beslissing te nemen over haar kostbare creatie. 
(voetnoot 1) 

Als deze uitspraak van Sir Robert Jennings in verband gebracht 
wordt met het feit dat de USA haar geweldige schuld aan het UN 
budget, waarvan het budget voor het Internationaal Gerechtshof 
slechts een klein deel van uitmaakt, nog steeds niet heeft

Subject:   Het ICJ staat onder druk 

Het Internationaal Gerechtshof staat onder druk.

In december 1994, heeft de Algemene Vergadering van de UN 
(UNGA), ondanks de weerstand van de NATO Kernwapen Staten een 
resolutie aanvaard waarin het Internationaal Gerechtshof (ICJ) 
dringend gevraagd werd een uitspraak te doen over de vraag: "Is 
het dreigen met -- of gebruik van Kernwapens in elke situatie 
toegestaan onder internationaal recht?" 
Tijdens de publieke hoorzittingen afgelopen november hebben 16 
Anti-Kernwapen Staten nog meer druk van de USA, de UK en 
Frankrijk weerstaan en hebben goed onderbouwde argumenten voor 
het illegaal zijn van Kernwapens naar voren gebracht.  
China is niet verschenen en de overige Kernwapen Staten konden 
alleen Duitsland en Italie overhalen om in hun voordeel te 
getuigen.  

Het World Court Project (WCP) wacht samen met andere 
Vredesgroepen, en ook Milieugroepen op de beslissing van het 
Internationaal Gerechtshof over bovenstaande vraag. Het is 
misschien wel de belangrijkste zaak, waarover het Internationaal 
Gerechtshof in haar bestaan, een uitspraak zal doen.  Een 
uitspraak, die nu toch wel verwacht zou mogen worden. Eerst werd 
deze uitspraak verwacht in Maart, daarna in Mei en nou zijn er 
aanwijzingen dat het wel eind Juni kan worden; net voor de 
sluiting van het hof, vanwege haar zomerreces.  
 
Een legitieme reden hiervoor is dat het Internationaal 
Gerechtshof zeer zeker erg hard aan het werk is aan de Bosnie-
Joegoslavie-zaak.  Maar er blijken ook andere reden te bestaan 
die ons (Groepen binnen het Abolition 2000 netwerk, waaronder 
WCP en GANA) grote zorgen baren.  

1. Op een conferentie in Edinburgh van de International Law 
Association hebben we op 10 mei van Sir Robert Jennings (oud 
president van het Internationaal Gerechtshof te Den Haag) te 
horen gekregen dat het Internationaal Gerechtshof in financiele 
moeilijkheden is. Hij waarschuwde dat het Internationaal 
Gerechtshof gesloten werd.  Hij gaf aan dat het complete 
secretariaat van het Internationaal Gerechtshof naar huis 
gestuurd is; en het aantal vertalers (toch al onderbemand) nog 
verder is teruggebracht.  Hij vroeg iedereen zijn invloed aan te 
wenden om het hof te beschermen, speciaal op het moment dat het 
hof bezig is een beslissing te nemen over haar kostbare creatie. 
(voetnoot 1) 

Als deze uitspraak van Sir Robert Jennings in verband gebracht 
wordt met het feit dat de USA haar geweldige schuld aan het UN 
budget, waarvan het budget voor het Internationaal Gerechtshof 
slechts een klein deel van uitmaakt, nog steeds niet heeft 
betaald, dan is dat op zijn minst opmerkelijk.  (voetnoot 2) 

Sindsdien hebben we gehoord dat de Persofficier van het 
Internationaal gerechtshof plotseling met pensioen is gestuurd 
en niet zal worden vervangen.  

De ideale uitkomst voor de NATO kernwapen staten zou zijn dat 
het Internationaal Gerechtshof geen uitspraak kan doen vanwege 
het gebrek aan secretariele ondersteuning en vanwege ruzies 
tussen sommige ge-intimideerde rechters. Het Internationaal 
Gerechtshof zou de zaak laten vallen, waarop de zaak behandeld 
zou worden afgedaan als irrelevant voor de Wereld.  Vooral de 
Britse en de Franse regeringen, in het bijzonder, vrezen dat, 
met een bevestiging van het Internationaal Gerechtshof dat het 
dreigen met -- en het gebruik van Kernwapens illegaal is, hun 
permanente zetels in de UN veiligheids- raad (UN Security

zetels alleen vanwege hun Kernwapen arsenaal bezitten.  Maar de 
rechters hebben echter hun reputatie hoog te houden.... en het 
zou duidelijk aantonen dat ze gemanipuleerd werden.

Acties in de USA rond het Kernwapen programma van de USA

Er zijn door belangrijke Vredesgroepen en Milieugroepen in de 
USA acties gestart rond het in de USA bestaande Kernwapens 
arsenaal; het uitbreiden in de USA van het Kernwapen arsenaal 
met nieuwe wapens en het in de USA doen van testen voor het 
instandhouden en uitbreiden van hun Kernwapen arsenaal.  De 
acties bestaan uit campagnes van belangrijke Vredes- en Milieu 
groepen om de Amerikaanse politici en het Amerikaanse volk voor 
te lichten over het buitensporige en provocerende Kernwapen 
arsenaal beheers- en besturings programma van het Ministerie van 
Energie (Department Of Energy (DOE)).  En nadat dit algemeen 
bekend is, dit beheers- en besturings programma te gaan 
controleren en het Kernwapen arsenaal in te krimpen.  

Een facet van deze acties is een brief gericht aan de Secretaris 
Hazel O'leary van het Ministerie van Energie (DOE) die voor eind 
mei aan haar verzonden zal worden.  
De brief is ontworpen om delen van het Kernwapen arsenaal 
beheers- en besturings programma (zoals het doen van 
"subcritical" tests (voetnoot 1)) af te remmen en een eerlijke 
discussie rond de Kernwapen politiek van de USA, met druk vanuit 
groepen, die strijden voor ontwapening, te openen.  Alle 
Amerikaanse Vredesgroepen en Milieugroepen worden dringend 
gevraag deze brief te ondertekenen.  
Op het moment dat ik dit schrijf, wordt deze brief ter 
ondertekening aan Amerikaanse Vredes- en Milieu organisaties 
rond gestuurd.  (sorry, het is jammer voor ons, maar we kunnen 
niet meedoen aan deze actie, tenzij je een Amerikaans paspoort 
hebt; het is een interne Amerikaans Politieke zaak. Indien je 
echter een Amerikaans paspoort wel hebt, dan kan je contact 
opnemen met Greg Mello van  de Los Alamos Study Group; E-mail 
lasg@igc.apc.org of Tel: +1.505.982.7747 en daar de brief 
ondertekenen met je naam en naam van de organisatie waartoe je 
behoort.) 

Afhankelijk van het antwoord van het Amerikaanse Ministerie van 
Energie (DOE) op de inhoud en standpunten, die in de 
bovengemelde brief staan, zal het onderhandelingsproces kunnen 
uitmonden in een proces tegen de DOE, vanwege het overtreden van 
de Nationale Milieupolitieke Wet (National Environmental Policy 
Act (NEPA)).  
Een kerngroep van organisaties, die op dit gebied werkzaam 
geweest zijn, zal met een juridisch team onderleiding van NRDC 
samenwerken om deze Nationaal Milieupolitieke onderwerpen met de 
DOE op te lossen of indien nodig een proces tegen de DOE 
hierover te beginnen.  

De bovenvermelde brief was toen ik hem in mijn bezit kreeg, 
reeds ondertekend door: 
American Friends Service Committee (Denver), Citizen Alert, 
Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety, Economists Allied for 
Arms Reduction, Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, 
Institute for Science and Security, Los Alamos Study Group, 
Natural Resources Defense Council, Physisian for Social 
Responsibility, Tri-Valley CAREs and Western States Legal 
Foundation.  

Voetnoten:
(1) "Subcritical" tests zijn o.a. testen met gebruik van 
nucleair materiaal ter grote van een briefkaart, wat tot 
ontploffing gebracht wordt met behulp van een laser, zonder dat 
bij deze ontploffing een daadwerkelijke kernreactie (= ketting 
reactie) plaatsvind. Maar natuurlijk is dit wel een nucleaire 
test en levert dit wel schade op voor het milieu.

Subject:   Engelse Protest brief aan President Clinton 
           tegen Nucleaire testen.

Beste vrienden,

Hieronder tref je een protestbrief aan, gericht aan President 
Clinton (in het Engels) klaar om te printen en te verzenden en 
een ruwe vertaling van deze brief in het nederlands.  

De brief is een bewerking door mij van de brief die Alice Slater 
op abolition-caucus gezet heeft en die bedoeld is voor 
Amerikanen om hun Senatoren aan te schrijven, met het verzoek 
een protestbrief aan Clinton te sturen.  

In de Protestbrief aan Clinton wordt hem gevraag de geplande 
"sub-critical" testen, niet uit te voeren. De eerste is gepland 
voor 18 juni; we hebben dus enige haast voor het uitvoeren van 
deze actie.  Kopieer de brief; laat mensen hun handtekening 
zetten en de brief opsturen.  

Groetjes, 

Ak Malten, 

GANA.
===============================================================================
The Honourable William J. Clinton
President of the United States of America
The White House
Washington, DC 20500
USA
 
Dear Mr. President,

        Please Mr. President, as a citizen of the Netherlands 
and on behalf of the World, its Nature and its Inhabitants, I 
urge you to cancel announced plans to conduct six "sub-critical 
" underground nuclear tests at the Nevada test site scheduled to 
begin on June 18th.  

        The tests are part of  a <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a>-called plan for a $40 
billion "stockpile stewardship program" designed by 
unreconstructed cold warriors to "keep the design team 
together", as they work on megacomputers to design new nuclear 
weapons for use in space and as earth penetrators.  The 
weaponeers contend that they test merely to insure the "safety 
and reliability" of the ageing arsenal. But the purpose of the 
new form of nuclear testing, "sub-critical" in combination with 
the use of extensive computer simulation programs is actually to 
test new nuclear weapon designs in virtual reality and 
underground.  

        Rather than passively monitoring the nuclear arsenal 
while it awaits dismantlement, the USA has plans for a whole new 
panoply of nuclear experiments, including a $1.5 billion 
contract with Bechtel for "sub-critical" tests. It plans to 
equip the labs with technology for virtual reality computer 
simulations of new weapons, ie, the National Ignition Facility 
at Livermore, the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrotest Facility at 
Los Alamos, the Jupiter Facility at Sandia, and other 
technologies which are sure to encourage proliferation by other 
countries who will doubt the USA's commitment to the promise 
made at the Non-Proliferation Treaty conference to work for 
nuclear disarmament.  

        Thus while CTB negotiations continue in Geneva for your 
professed goal of a "zero-yield" CTB, the weapons labs go 
forward with sub-critical and computer testing, making a mockery 
of the original intention of the CTB to end the development of 
new weapons.  In the June 18th sub-critical test in Nevada, high 
explosives will be detonated underground in proximity to 
plutonium without quite setting off a critical chain reaction, 
at a cost of $20 million dollars for each test.  

        Please support us in our efforts to end the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons by canceling the sub-critical 
tests and close the test sites.  

Sincerely, 








The Netherlands, June 1996.                                     

------------ wat volgt is een ruwe vertaling van de brief

Aan de Zeer Geachte Heer  W.J.Clinton
President van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika
Het Witte Huis
Washington, DC 20500
USA

Zeer Geachte Meneer de President, 

Als 't U blieft, Meneer de President, als inwoner van Nederland 
en omwille van de Wereld, haar Natuur en haar Bevolking vraag ik 
U vriendelijk, doch dringend om de aangekondigde zes "sub-
critical" ondergrondse nucleaire test in het Nevada testgebied, 
te beginnen op de 18 de Juni, niet uit te voeren.  

De testen zijn een onderdeel van het 40 miljard dollar kostende 
plan, "Het beheersprogramma van het Kernwapen arsenaal". Dat 
plan is ontworpen door niet met hun tijd meegaande Koude Oorlog 
krijgers "om hun ontwerp-team bij elkaar te houden", terwijl ze 
werken op hun supercomputers om nieuwe Kernwapens te ontwerpen. 
Deze nieuwe Kernwapens zijn bedoeld voor het gebruik in de 
ruimte en om door de aardkorst heen te dringen. De Kernwapen 
ontwerpers willen ons doen geloven dat ze alleen maar bezig zijn 
met het testen om de "veiligheid en zekerheid" te onderzoeken 
van hun ouder wordend arsenaal. Maar het doel van de nieuwe vorm 
van testen, "sub-critical" in combinatie met het gebruik van 
zeer uitgebreide computer simulatie programma's is het testen 
van nieuwe kernwapen ontwerpen m.b.v. virtual reality en 
ondergronds.  

In plaats van passief hun Kernwapen arsenaal te bewaken, totdat 
het ontmanteld zal worden, heeft de USA plannen gemaakt voor een 
geheel nieuwe serie van nucleaire experimenten, inclusief een 
1,5 miljard dollar kostend contract met Bechtel voor "sub-
critical" testen. Het heeft plannen om de wapenlaboratoria, 
zoals de National Ignition Facility in Livermore, de Dual Axis 
Radiographic Hydrotest Facility in Los Alamos, de Jupiter 
Facility in Sandia, te bevoorraden met technologie voor het doen 
van virtual reality computer simulaties van nieuwe wapenvormen 
en andere technische hoogstandjes. Andere landen zullen de 
Amerikaanse, tijdens de conferentie over het "Non-Proliferatie 
Verdrag", gedane belofte om te werken aan een ontwapening op het 
gebied van Kernwapens in twijfel trekken. Wat deze landen zeker 
zal aanmoedigen zich ook te bewapenen.  

Dus, terwijl de CTB onderhandelingen doorgaan in Geneve om het 
door U publiekelijke uitgesproken gewenste doel van een "Nul-
optie" CTB te bereiken, gaan de Kernwapen laboratoria verder met 
sub-critical testen en computer simulaties die de 
oorspronkelijke opzet van het CTB om de ontwikkeling van nieuwe 
wapens te be-eindigen, belachelijk maken. Tijdens de "sub-
critical" test van 18 juni in Nevada zullen zeer explosieve 
stoffen in de nabijheid van plutonium ondergronds tot 
ontploffing gebracht worden, zonder dat dit een Nucleaire 
kettingreactie van het plutonium ten gevolg heeft. De kosten van  
zo'n test is 20 miljoen dollar.  

Als 't U blieft, steun ons in onze pogingen om de uitbereiding 
van Kernwapens een halt toe te roepen, door de sub-critical 
testen niet uit te voeren en de testgebieden te sluiten.

Subject:   Engelse Protest brief aan President Clinton 
           tegen Nucleaire testen.

Beste vrienden,

Hieronder tref je een protestbrief aan, gericht aan President 
Clinton (in het Engels) klaar om te printen en te verzenden en 
een ruwe vertaling van deze brief in het nederlands.  

De brief is een bewerking door mij van de brief die Alice Slater 
op abolition-caucus gezet heeft en die bedoeld is voor 
Amerikanen om hun Senatoren aan te schrijven, met het verzoek 
een protestbrief aan Clinton te sturen.  

In de Protestbrief aan Clinton wordt hem gevraag de geplande 
"sub-critical" testen, niet uit te voeren. De eerste is gepland 
voor 18 juni; we hebben dus enige haast voor het uitvoeren van 
deze actie.  Kopieer de brief; laat mensen hun handtekening 
zetten en de brief opsturen.  

Groetjes, 

Ak Malten, 

GANA.
===============================================================================
The Honourable William J. Clinton
President of the United States of America
The White House
Washington, DC 20500
USA
 
Dear Mr. President,

        Please Mr. President, as a citizen of the Netherlands 
and on behalf of the World, its Nature and its Inhabitants, I 
urge you to cancel announced plans to conduct six "sub-critical 
" underground nuclear tests at the Nevada test site scheduled to 
begin on June 18th.  

        The tests are part of  a <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a>-called plan for a $40 
billion "stockpile stewardship program" designed by 
unreconstructed cold warriors to "keep the design team 
together", as they work on megacomputers to design new nuclear 
weapons for use in space and as earth penetrators.  The 
weaponeers contend that they test merely to insure the "safety 
and reliability" of the ageing arsenal. But the purpose of the 
new form of nuclear testing, "sub-critical" in combination with 
the use of extensive computer simulation programs is actually to 
test new nuclear weapon designs in virtual reality and 
underground.  

        Rather than passively monitoring the nuclear arsenal 
while it awaits dismantlement, the USA has plans for a whole new 
panoply of nuclear experiments, including a $1.5 billion 
contract with Bechtel for "sub-critical" tests. It plans to 
equip the labs with technology for virtual reality computer 
simulations of new weapons, ie, the National Ignition Facility 
at Livermore, the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrotest Facility at 
Los Alamos, the Jupiter Facility at Sandia, and other 
technologies which are sure to encourage proliferation by other 
countries who will doubt the USA's commitment to the promise 
made at the Non-Proliferation Treaty conference to work for 
nuclear disarmament.  

        Thus while CTB negotiations continue in Geneva for your 
professed goal of a "zero-yield" CTB, the weapons labs go 
forward with sub-critical and computer testing, making a mockery 
of the original intention of the CTB to end the development of 
new weapons.  In the June 18th sub-critical test in Nevada, high 
explosives will be detonated underground in proximity to 
plutonium without quite setting off a critical chain reaction, 
at a cost of $20 million dollars for each test.  

        Please support us in our efforts to end the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons by canceling the sub-critical 
tests and close the test sites.  

Sincerely, 








The Netherlands, June 1996.                                     

------------ wat volgt is een ruwe vertaling van de brief

Aan de Zeer Geachte Heer  W.J.Clinton
President van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika
Het Witte Huis
Washington, DC 20500
USA

Zeer Geachte Meneer de President, 

Als 't U blieft, Meneer de President, als inwoner van Nederland 
en omwille van de Wereld, haar Natuur en haar Bevolking vraag ik 
U vriendelijk, doch dringend om de aangekondigde zes "sub-
critical" ondergrondse nucleaire test in het Nevada testgebied, 
te beginnen op de 18 de Juni, niet uit te voeren.  

De testen zijn een onderdeel van het 40 miljard dollar kostende 
plan, "Het beheersprogramma van het Kernwapen arsenaal". Dat 
plan is ontworpen door niet met hun tijd meegaande Koude Oorlog 
krijgers "om hun ontwerp-team bij elkaar te houden", terwijl ze 
werken op hun supercomputers om nieuwe Kernwapens te ontwerpen. 
Deze nieuwe Kernwapens zijn bedoeld voor het gebruik in de

zeer uitgebreide computer simulatie programma's is het testen 
van nieuwe kernwapen ontwerpen m.b.v. virtual reality en

Subject: Acties tegen Amerikaanse en Chinese Kernproeven.
Date: Thu, 13 Jun 1996 18:34:41 +0200

Beste vrienden,

Hierbij wil ik ieder op de hoogte stellen van de komende acties tegen zowel
de Chinese als Amerikaanse Kernproeven.
China heeft vorige week zaterdag een ondergrondse Kernproef gehouden. China
heeft verder aangekondigd voor eind september nog een kernproef te willen
houden.
Daarna wil China in de komende 10 jaar geen Kernproeven meer te houden, om
na die periode e.v.t. te besluiten weer opnieuw Kernproeven te gaan uitvoeren.
Amerika heeft aangekondigd dit jaar 2 "sub-critical" Kernproeven te willen
houden en in de loop van volgend jaar nog een serie van 4 "sub-critical"
Kernproeven. De eerste Amerikaanse test zal 18 juni a.s. uitgevoerd worden in
de staat Nevada.

Hiertegen moet actie worden gevoerd. In de hele wereld zijn er dan ook in
deze en de komende week acties gepland.

In Nederland zijn er 3 acties gepland. Er wordt hierbij samengewerkt door
Voor Moeder Aarde Nederland, Het Haags Vredes Platform, een scholierengroep
Zoutzuur,
Global Anti-Nuclear Alliance. Alle 3 de acties zijn in Den Haag, omdat daar
de Ambassades gevestigd zijn en ook het Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken in 
Den Haag zit.
Het is de bedoeling de acties vreedzaam te laten verlopen.

Actie 1.: Een Demonstratieve Wake op maandag 17 juni om 20.00 uur voor de
          Amerikaanse Ambassade tegen hun voorgenomen "sub-critical"

Subject: Acties tegen Amerikaanse en Chinese Kernproeven.
Date: Thu, 13 Jun 1996 18:34:41 +0200

Beste vrienden,

Hierbij wil ik ieder op de hoogte stellen van de komende acties tegen zowel
de Chinese als Amerikaanse Kernproeven.
China heeft vorige week zaterdag een ondergrondse Kernproef gehouden. China
heeft verder aangekondigd voor eind september nog een kernproef te willen
houden.
Daarna wil China in de komende 10 jaar geen Kernproeven meer te houden, om
na die periode e.v.t. te besluiten weer opnieuw Kernproeven te gaan uitvoeren.
Amerika heeft aangekondigd dit jaar 2 "sub-critical" Kernproeven te willen
houden en in de loop van volgend jaar nog een serie van 4 "sub-critical"
Kernproeven. De eerste Amerikaanse test zal 18 juni a.s. uitgevoerd worden in
de staat Nevada.

Hiertegen moet actie worden gevoerd. In de hele wereld zijn er dan ook in
deze en de komende week acties gepland.

In Nederland zijn er 3 acties gepland. Er wordt hierbij samengewerkt door
Voor Moeder Aarde Nederland, Het Haags Vredes Platform, een scholierengroep
Zoutzuur,
Global Anti-Nuclear Alliance. Alle 3 de acties zijn in Den Haag, omdat daar
de Ambassades gevestigd zijn en ook het Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken in 
Den Haag zit.
Het is de bedoeling de acties vreedzaam te laten verlopen.

Actie 1.: Een Demonstratieve Wake op maandag 17 juni om 20.00 uur voor de
          Amerikaanse Ambassade tegen hun voorgenomen "sub-critical"
          Kernproeven.
Actie 2.: Een protestdemonstratie op dinesdag 18 juni om 11.00 uur voor de
          Chinese Ambassade (A.Goekooplaan) tegen de onlangs uitgevoerde
Kernproef.
Actie 3.: Aansluitend aan actie 2. zal er als Minister van Mierlo ons zou 
          willen ontvangen, hem 4000 petities aangeboden worden en hem
          vriendelijk, maar dringend verzocht worden zijn stem te verheffen
          bij de Veiligheidsraad van de Verenigde Naties en de Kernproeven
          van zowel China als de Verenigde Staten af te keuren.

* Geen geld voor kernenergie;

IK BEVIND ME IN HET CENTRUM VAN VREDE

De wereld daarbuiten heeft geen vat op mij. Ik sta aan het hoofd van
mijn eigen wezen. Ik bewaak mijn eigen innerlijke wereld, want daar is
het waar ik creer. Ik doe wat nodig is om mijn eigen innerlijke
wereld vredig te houden.

Mijn innerlijke vrede is essentieel voor mijn gezondheid en welzijn.
Ik keer naar binnen en vind die ruimte waar alles rustig en sereen is.
Ik kan haar zien als een vredig, diep en stil meer, omringd met groen
gras en met hoge, stille bomen. Ik kan haar voelen als witte, golvende
wolken waar je op kunt liggen en vertroeteld kunt worden. Ik kan haar
horen als heerlijke, vloeiende muziek die mijn zintuigen streelt.

Hoe ik ook mijn innerlijke ruimte wil ervaren, ik vind vrede. In het
midden van die vrede bevind ik mij. Ik vorm de puurheid en de stilte
van mijn creatieve proces. In vrede creer ik. In vrede leef en beweeg
ik en ervaar ik het leven. Omdat ik midden in die innerlijke vrede
blijf staan, vind ik vrede in de wereld buiten mij.

En hoewel anderen misschien in chaos en ruzie leven, heeft dat geen
vat op mij, want ik verklaar mijzelf in vrede. En ook al is er waanzin
overal om mij heen, ik ben kalm, rustig en tevreden. Het Universum
kenmerkt zich door grote ordelijkheid en vredigheid en ik weerspiegel
dit in ieder moment van mijn leven. Ik kies ervoor te-vrede-nheid uit
te drukken, want ikzelf ben vrede.
En zo is het.

(Louise Hay)

subject: Datum uitspraak Internationaal Gerechtshof/
         Datum van het ophalen van de Declarations of Public Conscience bij
         het Internationaal Gerechtshof.

Beste vrienden,

Hieronder volgt belangrijk nieuws inzake de uitspraak over de 
legaliteit van Kernwapens door het Internationaal Gerechtshof.
En wat betreft de Declarations of Public Conscience (DPC)
(Dat zijn Verklaringen van Rechtsbewustzijn van particulieren
over de hele wereld verzameld, die aan de rechters van het 
Internationaal Gerechtshof zijn aangeboden als ondersteuning
van de uitspraken van de verschillende landen tegen Kernwapens)

Het Internationaal Gerechtshof zal maandag 8 juli om 10.00 uur
een adviserende uitspraak doen inzake de legaliteit van Kernwapens.
(see COMMUNIQUE 96/21, sorry voor lezer van ANN.VREDE nieuwsgroep,
maar ik heb geen tijd voor een vertaling).

Op dinsdag morgen 9 juli om 10.00 uur zullen de dozen met
Verklaringen van Rechtsbewustzijn van particulieren voor 
de hekken van het Internationaal Gerechtshof worden opgesteld,
waarna ze door de Japanse TV worden gefilmd.
In het totaal zijn er 3.691.899 Verklaringen van Rechtsbewustzijn 
door particulieren ondertekend, waarvan er alleen al in Japan 
3.338.408 zijn verzameld. 
Ik schat dat er ongeveer 120 dozen opgestapeld moeten worden.
Voor de nederlandse pers is dit OOK de gelegenheid om deze dozen 
te fotograferen en/of te filmen en een interview te houden met 
leden van het World Court Project. 
Nadat dit gebeurd is zullen de dozen weer ergens worden opgeslagen,
totdat ze aan de reis naar Engeland beginnen (sept/okt), waar
ze permanent tentoongesteld gaan worden in een vredesmuseum.

Met vriendelijke groeten,

Ak Malten,

GANA.

(Voor ANN.VREDE graag reacties naar mijn E-mail adres;
ik kan wel E-mailen naar ANN.VREDE, maar de discussie

Subject: !!!Uitspraak Internationaal Gerechtshof inzake Kernwapens!!!  
Date: Sat, 29 Jun 1996 22:12:23 +0200

subject: Datum uitspraak Internationaal Gerechtshof/
         Datum van het ophalen van de Declarations of Public Conscience bij
         het Internationaal Gerechtshof.

Beste vrienden,

Hieronder volgt belangrijk nieuws inzake de uitspraak over de 
legaliteit van Kernwapens door het Internationaal Gerechtshof.
En wat betreft de Declarations of Public Conscience (DPC)
(Dat zijn Verklaringen van Rechtsbewustzijn van particulieren
over de hele wereld verzameld, die aan de rechters van het 
Internationaal Gerechtshof zijn aangeboden als ondersteuning
van de uitspraken van de verschillende landen tegen Kernwapens)

Het Internationaal Gerechtshof zal maandag 8 juli om 10.00 uur
een adviserende uitspraak doen inzake de legaliteit van Kernwapens.
(see COMMUNIQUE 96/21, sorry voor lezer van ANN.VREDE nieuwsgroep,
maar ik heb geen tijd voor een vertaling).

Op dinsdag morgen 9 juli om 10.00 uur zullen de dozen met
Verklaringen van Rechtsbewustzijn van particulieren voor 
de hekken van het Internationaal Gerechtshof worden opgesteld,
waarna ze door de Japanse TV worden gefilmd.
In het totaal zijn er 3.691.899 Verklaringen van Rechtsbewustzijn 
door particulieren ondertekend, waarvan er alleen al in Japan 
3.338.408 zijn verzameld. 
Ik schat dat er ongeveer 120 dozen opgestapeld moeten worden.
Voor de nederlandse pers is dit OOK de gelegenheid om deze dozen 
te fotograferen en/of te filmen en een interview te houden met 
leden van het World Court Project. 
Nadat dit gebeurd is zullen de dozen weer ergens worden opgeslagen,
totdat ze aan de reis naar Engeland beginnen (sept/okt), waar
ze permanent tentoongesteld gaan worden in een vredesmuseum.

Met vriendelijke groeten,

Ak Malten,

GANA.

(Voor ANN.VREDE graag reacties naar mijn E-mail adres;
ik kan wel E-mailen naar ANN.VREDE, maar de discussie
op de nieuwsgroep niet volgen!)

Subject: new CTBT text
Date: Wed, 3 Jul 1996 17:31:53 +0200

Hieronder volgen  de belangrijkste stukken uit de nieuwe compromis-tekst
voor een CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty), zoals die afgelopen vrijdag
28-6-96 in Geneve door de voorzitter, ambassadeur Ramaker,  is voorgelegd
aan de Conference on Disarmament (CD). 

Deze tekst wordt nu door de 61 lidstaten van de CD bestudeerd. Het is de
bedoeling dat de CD-delegaties op 29 juli weer bij elkaar komen, om dan
(hopelijk) tot formele overeenstemming te komen. 
Als dat gelukt is, kan vervolgens de Algemene Vergadering van de VN (in een
speciale sessie in augustus) haar goedkeuring verlenen, om tenslotte in
september door de VN  ondertekend te worden.

De tijd ontbrak helaas om dit bericht uit de nieuwsgroup "abolition-caucus
in het Nederlands te vertalen, terwijl noch het Miniserie van Buitenlandse
Zaken, noch NGO-waarnemers in de CD, een (officiele) Nederlandse vertaling
zullen maken.

The following is the interesting segments of the new text of the CTBT put
down by Jaap Ramaker 4pm Friday 28th June. Words that are underlined will be
in capitals for emailing purposes. Please excuse typos, I've done this in a
hurry to get it out ASAP, love felicity ruby 

Preamble

The States Parties to this Treaty (hereinafter referred to as "the States
Parties"),

WELCOMING the international agreements and other positive measures of recent
years in the field of nuclear disarmament, including reductions in arsenals
of nuclear weapons, as well as in the field of the prevention of nuclear
proliferation in all its aspects,

UNDERLINING the importance of the full and prompt implementation of such
agreements and 
measures,

CONVINCED that the present international situation provides an opportunity
to take further effective measures towards nuclear disarmament and against
the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, 

and DECLARING their intention to take such measures,

STRESSING therefore the need for continued systematic and progressive
efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of
eliminating those weapons, and of general and complete disarmament under
strict and effective international control,

RECOGNIZING that the cessation of all nuclear weapon test explosions and all
other nuclear 
explosions, by constraining the development and qualitative improvement of
nuclear weapons and ending the development of advanced new types of nuclear
weapons, constitutes and effective measure of nuclear disarmament and
non-proliferation in all its aspects, 

FURTHER RECOGNISING that an end to all such nuclear explosions will thus
constitute a 
meaningful step in the realisation of a systematic process to achieve
nuclear disarmament,

CONVINCED that the most effective way to achieve an end to nuclear testing
is through the 
conclusion of a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable
comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, which has long been one of the
highest priority objectives of the international community in the field of
disarmament and non-proliferation,

NOTING the aspirations expressed by the Parties to the 1963 Treaty Banning
Nuclear Weapons Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water to
seek to achieve the discontinuation of all test explosions of nuclear
weapons for all time,

NOTING ALSO the views expressed that this Treaty could contribute to the
protection of the 
environment,

AFFIRMING the purpose of attracting the adherence of all States to this
Treaty and its objective to contribute effectively to the prevention of the
proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, to the process of
nuclear disarmament and therefore to the enhancement of international peace
and security,

HAVE AGREED as follows:

end Preamble

ON SITE INSPECTIONS

34. Each State Party has the right to request an on-site inspection in
accordance with the provision of this Article and Part II of the Protocol in
the territory or in any other place under the jurisdiction or control of any
State Party, or in any area beyond the jurisdiction or control of any State.

35.  The sole purpose of an on-site inspection shall be to clarify whether a
nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion has been
carried out in violation of Article I and, to the extent possible, to gather
any facts which might assist in identifying any possible violator.

36.  The requesting State Party shall be under the obligation to keep the
on-site inspection request within the scope of this Treaty and to provide in
the request information in accordance with paragraph 
37.  The requesting State party shall refrain from unfounded or abusive
inspection requests.

37.  The on-site inspection request shall be based on information collected

information obtained by national technical means of verification in a manner
consistent with generally recognised principles of international law, or a
combination thereof.  The request shall contain information pursuant to Part
II, paragraph of the Protocol.

38.  The requesting State Party shall present the on-site inspection request
to the Executive Council and at the same time to the Director-General for
the latter to begin immediately processing.

Protocol, and, if necessary, shall assist the requesting State party in
filing the request accordingly, and shall communicate the request to the
Executive Council and to all other States Parties within 24 hours.

41.  When the on-site inspection request fulfills the requirements, the
Technical Secretariat shall begin preparations for the on-site inspection
without delay.

42.  the Director-General, upon receipt of an on-site inspection request
referring to an inspection area under the jurisdiction or control of a State
Party, shall immediately seek clarification from the State party sought to
be inspected in order to clarify and resolve the concern raised in the request.

43.  A State party that receives a request for clarification pursuant to
paragraph 42 shall provide the Director-General with explanations and with
other relevant information available as soon as possible, but no later than
72 hours after receipt of the request for clarification.

44. The Director-General, before the Executive Council takes a decision on
the on-site inspection request, shall transmit immediately to the Executive
Council and additional information available from the International
Monitoring System or provided by any State Party on the event specified in
the request, including any clarification provided pursuant to paragraphs 42
and 43, as well as any other information from within the Technical
Secretariat that the Director-General deems relevant or that is requested by
the Executive Council.

45.  Unless the requesting State party considers the concern raised in the
on-site inspection request to be resolved and withdraws the request, the
Executive Council shall take a decision on the request in accordance with
paragraph 46.

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL DECISIONS

46.  The Executive Council shall takes a decision on the on-site inspection
request no later than 96 hours after receipt of the request from the
requesting State party. The decision to approve the on-site inspection shall
be made by a majority of all members of the Executive Council.  If the
Executive Council does not approve the inspection, preparations shall be
stopped and no further action on the request shall be taken.

47.  No later than 25 days after the approval of the on-site inspection in
accordance with paragraph 46, the inspection team shall transmit to the
Executive Council, through the Director-General, a progress inspection
report.  The continuation of the inspection shall be considered approved
unless the Executive Council, no later than 72 hours after receipt of the
progress inspection report, decides by a majority of all its members not to
continue the inspection.  If the Executive Council decides not to continue
the inspection, the inspection shall be terminated, and the inspection team
shall leave the inspection area and the territory of the inspected State
Party as soon as possible in accordance with Part II, paragraphs 109 and 110
of the Protocol.

END ON ON-SITE INSPECTION TEXT THAT I HAVE

REVIEW OF THE TREATY - ARTICLE VIII

1.  Unless otherwise decided by a majority of the States Parties, ten years
after the entry into force of this Treaty, a Conference of the States
Parties shall be held to review the operation and effectiveness of this
Treaty, with a view to assuring itself that the objectives and purposes in
the Preamble and the provisions of the Treaty are being realized.  Such
review shall take into account any new scientific and technological
developments relevant to this Treaty.  On the basis of a request by any
State Party, the Review Conference shall consider the possibility of
permitting the conduct of underground nuclear explosions for peaceful
purposes.  If the Review Conference decides by consensus that such nuclear
explosions may be permitted, it shall commence work without delay, with a
view to recommending to States parties an appropriate amendment to this
Treaty that shall preclude any military benefits of such nuclear explosions.
Any such proposed amendment shall be communicated 
to the Directory-General by any State Party and shall be dealt with in
accordance with the provision of Article VII.

2.  At intervals of ten years thereafter, further Review Conferences may be
convened with the same objective, if the Conference <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> decides as a matter
of procedure in the preceding year.  Such Conferences may be convened after
an interval of less than ten years if <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a> decided by the Conference as a
matter of substance.

3.  Normally, any Review Conference shall be held immediately following the
regular annual session of the Conference provided for in Article II.

Hieronder volgen  de belangrijkste stukken uit de nieuwe compromis-tekst
voor een CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty), zoals die afgelopen vrijdag
28-6-96 in Geneve door de voorzitter, ambassadeur Ramaker,  is voorgelegd
aan de Conference on Disarmament (CD). 

Deze tekst wordt nu door de 61 lidstaten van de CD bestudeerd. Het is de
bedoeling dat de CD-delegaties op 29 juli weer bij elkaar komen, om dan
(hopelijk) tot formele overeenstemming te komen. 
Als dat gelukt is, kan vervolgens de Algemene Vergadering van de VN (in een
speciale sessie in augustus) haar goedkeuring verlenen, om tenslotte in
september door de VN  ondertekend te worden.

De tijd ontbrak helaas om dit bericht uit de nieuwsgroup "abolition-caucus
in het Nederlands te vertalen, terwijl noch het Miniserie van Buitenlandse
Zaken, noch NGO-waarnemers in de CD, een (officiele) Nederlandse vertaling
zullen maken.

========================================================================
The following is the interesting segments of the new text of the CTBT put
down by Jaap Ramaker 4pm Friday 28th June. Words that are underlined will be
in capitals for emailing purposes. Please excuse typos, I've done this in a
hurry to get it out ASAP, love felicity ruby 

Preamble

The States Parties to this Treaty (hereinafter referred to as "the States
Parties"),

WELCOMING the international agreements and other positive measures of recent
years in the field of nuclear disarmament, including reductions in arsenals
of nuclear weapons, as well as in the field of the prevention of nuclear
proliferation in all its aspects,

UNDERLINING the importance of the full and prompt implementation of such
agreements and 
measures,

CONVINCED that the present international situation provides an opportunity
to take further effective measures towards nuclear disarmament and against
the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, 

and DECLARING their intention to take such measures,

STRESSING therefore the need for continued systematic and progressive
efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of
eliminating those weapons, and of general and complete disarmament under
strict and effective international control,

RECOGNIZING that the cessation of all nuclear weapon test explosions and all
other nuclear 
explosions, by constraining the development and qualitative improvement of
nuclear weapons and ending the development of advanced new types of nuclear
weapons, constitutes and effective measure of nuclear disarmament and
non-proliferation in all its aspects, 

FURTHER RECOGNISING that an end to all such nuclear explosions will thus
constitute a 
meaningful step in the realisation of a systematic process to achieve
nuclear disarmament,

CONVINCED that the most effective way to achieve an end to nuclear testing
is through the 
conclusion of a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable
comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, which has long been one of the
highest priority objectives of the international community in the field of
disarmament and non-proliferation,

NOTING the aspirations expressed by the Parties to the 1963 Treaty Banning
Nuclear Weapons Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water to
seek to achieve the discontinuation of all test explosions of nuclear
weapons for all time,

NOTING ALSO the views expressed that this Treaty could contribute to the
protection of the 
environment,

AFFIRMING the purpose of attracting the adherence of all States to this
Treaty and its objective to contribute effectively to the prevention of the
proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, to the process of
nuclear disarmament and therefore to the enhancement of international peace
and security,

HAVE AGREED as follows:

end Preamble

the on-site inspection request, shall transmit immediately to the Executive
Council and additional information available from the International
Monitoring System or provided by any State Party on the event specified in
the request, including any clarification provided pursuant to paragraphs 42
and 43, as well as any other information from within the Technical

accordance with paragraph 46, the inspection team shall transmit to the
Executive Council, through the Director-General, a progress inspection
report.  The continuation of the inspection shall be considered approved
unless the Executive Council, no later than 72 hours after receipt of the
progress inspection report, decides by a majority of all its members not to
continue the inspection.  If the Executive Council decides not to continue
the inspection, the inspection shall be terminated, and the inspection team
shall leave the inspection area and the territory of the inspected State
Party as soon as possible in accordance with Part II, paragraphs 109 and 110
of the Protocol.

-------------- Enclosure number 1 ----------------
                        ACTION ALERT
May 27, 1996
As of this writing the impasse between the Zapatista Army of
National Liberation (EZLN) and the Mexican government
remains unresolved.  The recent sentence of two "alleged"
members of the EZLN to long prison terms with no significant
evidence against them and a complete lack of due process has
caused the EZLN to declare the "impossibility" of a
continuance of the peace talks.
Because these political prisoners are literally hostages of
the peace process the National Commission for Democracy, USA
has declared the need for a national campaign for their
liberation. Until such liberation occurs, the Mexican
government will continue to utilize them to extort
concessions at the negotiating table and/or use their
imprisonment against accountability to any agreements.  The
EZLN has also called upon the Mexican government to take
some definitive action against the para-military groups and
"death" squads which are openly operating in the state of
Chiapas.
The present impasse in combination with a widespread famine
due to the inability of indigenous communities to lay in
crops, present the same crisis as existed in February 9th of
1995, and December of 1994.
We therefore call upon all interested individuals and
organizations to aid us in increasing international pressure
upon the Mexican government by collaborating with us in a
Campaign for the Liberation of the Political Prisoners.
Although there exists some possibility the impasse may be
resolved this week, it is our belief that an international
campaign calling for the freedom of these prisoners has
become a primordial need.  We therefore will carry out this
Campaign regardless of the outcome of this present crisis.
The campaign for the Liberation of these prisoners consists
of the following;
     1) We ask all concerned individuals to initiate the
campaign with a simultaneous
      press conference to be held June 3-5th.  A history of
the irregularities contained
      in their imprisonment can be obtained through the
National Center for Democracy, Liberty and Justice at this
address.

     2)  A letter-writing campaign to Warren Christopher at
the State Department will     be conducted throughout the
period of June 5 through July 1.  We call upon    people to
hold educationals about this issue and to otherwise
publicize in any way     possible the lack of human rights
in Mexico.  A sample of the letter to Christopher      is
included with this alert.  Please call upon prominent
national and local leaders    to add their voices to this
petition in order to demonstrate the concern for a continued
peace process.

     3)  The campaign will end on July 1 by culminating in a
    National Day of Reflection and Prayer.  We call upon
                    Churches, individuals
           committed to peace, and community leaders to
                participate in this Day in a
public demonstration of
     support for the liberation of these prisoners
and the end to paramilitary operations in Chiapas.

  Please contact the National Center for Democracy,
Liberty and Justice for
further information.  We hope you share our great
hope
for peace in Mexico and we urge you to do whatever you
can to demonstrate this hope by your participation in
this campaign.

        COMPUTERS RELEASED.  FAST ENDS.  CHURCHES
       KEEP WORKING TO DELIVER COMPUTERS TO CUBA.

 With the release of the computers held by U.S. Customs in San
Diego, we ve seen the completion of two steps in a five-step process. 
Our work will not be complete until all of the humanitarian aid is in
Cuba,  stated the Reverend Lucius Walker, Jr., Executive Director of
the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization (IFCO) and
Pastors for Peace.  Rev. Walker outlined the remaining steps needed for
nearly 400 medical computers -- which had been seized by U.S.
authorities when the ecumenical group attempted to take them to Cuba
without a license -- to be delivered to churches and hospitals.

Last Friday night, May 24th, Rev. Walker, along with Lisa Valanti
and Jim Clifford, ended their 94-day fast when the 339 U.S.
computers, which had been confiscated in San Diego, were released to
the General Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist
Church.  Previously, Canadian Brian Rohatyn ended his fast when 23
Canadian computers were released on May 17th.  The Canadian
computers are now in Mexico awaiting shipment to Cuba.

 Three steps remain in this process,  explained Rev. Walker.   First,
the release of 35 more computers which were seized from Pastors for
Peace at the Highgate, Vermont border crossing on February 17th.  Next,
the transfer of the San Diego computers to Mexico and the Highgate
computers to Canada; and finally, delivery by the coalition of churches of
all the computers to Cuba -- which we pray will happen soon.

Department, as it reviews the information the Methodists have provided,
will be assured that these used medical computers are indeed
humanitarian aid and will allow their shipment to the intended destination:
churches and health care facilities in Cuba.

        COMPUTERS RELEASED.  FAST ENDS.  CHURCHES
       KEEP WORKING TO DELIVER COMPUTERS TO CUBA.

 With the release of the computers held by U.S. Customs in San
Diego, we ve seen the completion of two steps in a five-step process. 
Our work will not be complete until all of the humanitarian aid is in
Cuba,  stated the Reverend Lucius Walker, Jr., Executive Director of
the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization (IFCO) and
Pastors for Peace.  Rev. Walker outlined the remaining steps needed for
nearly 400 medical computers -- which had been seized by U.S.
authorities when the ecumenical group attempted to take them to Cuba
without a license -- to be delivered to churches and hospitals.

Last Friday night, May 24th, Rev. Walker, along with Lisa Valanti
and Jim Clifford, ended their 94-day fast when the 339 U.S.
computers, which had been confiscated in San Diego, were released to
the General Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist
Church.  Previously, Canadian Brian Rohatyn ended his fast when 23
Canadian computers were released on May 17th.  The Canadian
computers are now in Mexico awaiting shipment to Cuba.

 Three steps remain in this process,  explained Rev. Walker.   First,
the release of 35 more computers which were seized from Pastors for
Peace at the Highgate, Vermont border crossing on February 17th.  Next,
the transfer of the San Diego computers to Mexico and the Highgate
computers to Canada; and finally, delivery by the coalition of churches of
all the computers to Cuba -- which we pray will happen soon. 

Rev. Walker commented on the efforts of the broad-based and
determined grassroots support that made possible the release of the
computers.   <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>So</a> many people said the computers could never be freed by
the U.S. government, especially during this difficult moment for
U.S./Cuba relations.  But we are sure that the thousands of people who
applied pressure on Washington to win the computers  release won t rest
until the remaining steps of the process are completed. 

The Executive Director of IFCO/Pastors for Peace explained that the
Methodist Board of Church and Society -- as well as the other
church partners involved in this joint venture --  fully share in our
commitment to send this aid to Cuba without requesting or
accepting a Treasury license.  We do fully expect that the Treasury
Department, as it reviews the information the Methodists have provided,
will be assured that these used medical computers are indeed

Subject: update: another prisoner sentenced
Date: 28 May 1996 16:05:55


Update

     Recent news from Mexico indicates that Mexico's State
Department remains intransigent towards the EZLN.
Negotiator Marco Antonio Bernal stated today that:
     1) the federal gov't is not considering any "violent"
action
     2) the sentencing of the prisoners proceeds and the law
which governs the   peace is not a "straightjacket"
     3)the EZLN should bring any issues to the negotiating
table on June 5th or
     re-set a date.

     Meanwhile, in Veracruz, Francisco Garcia Santiago, a
presumed Zapatista, was found guilty and sentenced to 7
years in jail and a fine of $15,000 pesos.  Santiago was
sentenced based upon a confession obtained from him after
members of his family had been kidnapped by state police and
threats to their safety were used to obtain his confession.
He was sentenced for the sabotage of an electrical tower in
Veracruz.

From: "Pastors for Peace"  p4p@igc.apc.org 

THERE IS A FOOD CRISIS IN CHIAPAS.  YOU CAN HELP SAVE THE LIVES 
OF THOUSANDS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WHO ARE 
STRUGGLING FOR PEACE WITH JUSTICE AND DIGNITY.
 
                       Support the Campaign for Corn

During the Spring Caravan for Peace to Chiapas and Guatemala,
indigenous community leaders and human rights activists in Chiapas 
informed Pastors for Peace of the critical shortage of food in the
zones of conflict. Last year, the crops of  20,000 indigenous people
were destroyed after they fled their communities during the Mexican
army s February offensive.  As a result, they had very little food
during the previous year and very little seed with which to plant this
year s crop.

Paramilitary groups and the Mexican army are exacerbating the
shortage of food by threatening people who attempt to leave their
communities to tend to their fields or sell their products.  Some
communities have reported that the military has taken their land to
use as helipads or soldiers  quarters and regularly patrols their
fields to dissuade people from attending to crops. 

Indigenous community leaders have told Pastors for Peace that
international support for their communities is absolutely essential
to avoid widespread starvation.  The majority of indigenous men,
women and children in Chiapas  are already suffering some form of 
low-grade malnutrition.  The lack of food coupled with ongoing
military pressure threatens the lives of thousands of indigenous
families, and endangers the fragile peace process in Chiapas. 
Immediate emergency relief aid from international organizations is
critical.

In response to this urgent call, Pastors for Peace announces a
national Campaign for Corn. Pastors for Peace asks all supporters of
the indigenous struggle for peace with justice and dignity in
Chiapas to raise money for the purchase of food in Mexico.  Foodstuffs
will be delivered directly  to indigenous communities by Pastors for
Peace delegations this summer.  

The need for food is too great to wait for the next caravan. 
Express your solidarity by  raising urgently needed funds to feed
indigenous families TODAY.

how you want to help, please contact:

the interreligious foundation for community organization
402 west 145th street, new york, ny 10031  212/926-5757 
fax: 212/926-5842



This memo is an overview of the most recent developments in the
continuing campaign of IFCO/Pastors for Peace to deliver to Cuba,
without a license, the medical computers which U.S. Customs seized
from our volunteers in San Diego on January 31st and February 17th.

We are pleased to tell you that the computers in San Diego have been
RELEASED!!!!  

THANKS BE TO GOD WHO, WITH OUR HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS,  GAVE US THE VICTORY!!!

At 11pm on Friday, May 24th, day 94 of the Fast for Life, Dr. Thom
White Wolf Fassett, General Secretary of the General Board of Church
and Society of the United Methodist Church, signed an agreement with
the U.S. Treasury to achieve the release of the computers into the
custody of the General Board of Church and Society.  Dr. Fassett
authorized two local Methodist pastors in San Diego, The Rev. John
Lurvey and The Rev. James Jones, to act as his representatives.  Revs.
Jones and Lurvey supervised the transfer of the computers to a storage
facility rented by the Board of Church and Society.  The keys for the
storage facility are now in the pastors' possession.

At midnight on Friday, May 24 -- day 94 of the Fast for Life --  Rev.
Lucius Walker, Lisa Valanti and Jim Clifford ended their fast in a brief
service of celebration and thanksgiving in the Methodist Building. 

YOUR EFFORTS HAVE MADE THE DIFFERENCE!!!  BUT THE
CAMPAIGN IS NOT OVER.  WE HAVE COMPLETED ONLY
TWO STEPS OF A FIVE STEP PROCESS -- AND WHILE
NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE, WE MUST KEEP THE PRESSURE
ON!!!  


STEP ONE  -  RELEASE OF THE CANADIAN COMPUTERS
SEIZED IN SAN DIEGO 

On Friday, May 17th, the Canadian computers seized in San Diego
were released to the General Board of Church and Society of the
United Methodist Church and taken to a storage facility in Mexico. 
That evening Brian Rohatyn, the Canadian faster, ended his fast.

STEP TWO  -  RELEASE OF THE U.S. COMPUTERS SEIZED
IN SAN DIEGO 

On Friday, May 24th, the U.S. computers seized in San Diego on
January 31st & February 17th were released into the custody of the
General Board of Church & Society of the United Methodist Church
and put into storage in San Diego pending continued negotiations for
their transfer to Cuba.  Rev. Lucius Walker, Jr., James Clifford and
Lisa Valanti ended their 94-day fast that night.


STEP THREE  -  RELEASE INTO CANADA OF THE 35
COMPUTERS SEIZED AT HIGHGATE, VERMONT ON
FEBRUARY 17th 

On February 17th, Canadian and U.S. citizens attempted to donate 35
computers to Cuba by crossing the U.S./Canadian border at Highgate,
Vermont.  The computers were seized.  THESE COMPUTERS CAN
BE RELEASED THIS WEEK IF WE KEEP THE PRESSURE ON
THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND THE WHITE
HOUSE!    

STEP FOUR  -   TRANSFER TO MEXICO OF THE
COMPUTERS NOW IN CUSTODY OF THE GENERAL BOARD
OF CHURCH & SOCIETY OF THE  UNITED METHODIST
CHURCH WHICH ARE BEING HELD IN STORAGE IN SAN
DIEGO

These computers must be transferred to Mexico in preparation for
shipment to Cuba.  In the spirit of the negotiations between the Board
of Church and Society and the Treasury Department, it is likely that
this transfer could happen in a matter of days.  BUT TO INSURE
THIS TRANSFER WE ARE ASKING ALL OUR SUPPORTERS TO
KEEP THE PRESSURE ON BOTH THE TREASURY
DEPARTMENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE!!!

On a previous occasion U.S. Treasury agents broke into a private
storage locker and stole crutches and baby formula which we were
storing for a future caravan.  We know that another break-in is a
possibility; therefore, we must KEEP THE PRESSURE ON UNTIL
THE COMPUTERS ARE TRANSFERRED TO MEXICO!!!

STEP FIVE -   DELIVERY OF ALL THE COMPUTERS -- FROM
CANADA AND MEXICO -- TO CUBA

This caravan (Friendshipment VI) will not be complete until the 395
computers are delivered to the churches, clinics and hospitals in Cuba. 
The General Board of Church and Society will announce the date for
the delivery of the computers to Cuba; probably in June 1996.

As you can see, the campaign is not complete just because the fast is
ended.  The fasters were able to end their fast only because they felt
confident that you would not stop working for the completion of the
campaign.  WE PLEAD WITH YOU TO KEEP CALLING:

THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT:   SECRETARY RUBIN:
     202/622-1100 or -1080

THE WHITE HOUSE: LEON PANETTA:     202/456-6797

THANK THEM FOR THE POSITIVE STEPS WHICH HAVE BEEN
TAKEN -- AND INSIST THAT THE COMPUTERS BE ALLOWED
PASSAGE TO CUBA WITHOUT A LICENSE.

DON'T STOP NOW!  ONLY WITH YOUR CONTINUED
PARTICIPATION IN KEEPING UP THE PRESSURE WILL WE
SOON CELEBRATE SUCCESS!!  IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL THE
COMPUTERS ARE IN CUBA!!


We also ask that you write or fax MESSAGES OF THANKS AND
COMMENDATION to:

CONGRESSMAN CHARLES RANGEL, for his courage, his
heartfelt commitment, and his tireless leadership in mediating this
agreement with Treasury.  His address is:
     
Congressman Charles Rangel, Rayburn Building, Washington, D.C.
20515
 
DR. THOM WHITE WOLF FASSETT, for giving strong
ecumenical leadership in resolving this matter, for hosting the fasters,
and for making the commitment to send the computers to Cuba without
requesting a license!  His address is:   

     Dr. Thom White Wolf Fassett, General Secretary, General
Board of Church and Society, United Methodist Church, 100 Maryland
Avenue, NE, Washington, DC 20002


         
*****************************************************


IFCO would like to take this opportunity to express its profound
appreciation to Dr. Thom Fassett in particular, to the Board of Church
and Society in general, and to all of our ecumenical partners for their
efforts in achieving the successful resolution which will lead us to the
victory!  

For their prophetic vision and strong support, we give thanks to:

The Most Rev. Edmond L. Browning, Presiding Bishop of the
Episcopal Church 
Dr. Bennett W. Smith, Sr., President, Progressive National Baptist
Convention
Dr. Aidsand Wright-Riggins, Director, National Ministries, American
Baptist Churches/USA
Dr. Joan Brown Campbell, General Secretary, National Council of
Churches of Christ
Dr. Randolph Nugent, General Secretary, General Board of Church
and Society, United      Methodist Church
Bishop Richard O. Bass, Ecumenical Officer, Christian Methodist
Episcopal Church


      ****************************************************


Finally, let us all remember the next phase of the long-range work
which remains before us.  During the 94 days of the Fast for Life, we
have witnessed the beginning of a powerful new coalition: a new, more
mainstream coalition which is committed to working for an end to the
U.S. blockade of Cuba and for normalization of U.S./Cuba relations. 
For our future work, we can count on the nation's most influential
mainstream religious leadership; centrist Cuban-American groups;
labor and professional organizations; more than 70 members of
Congress; and hundreds of thousands of citizens of conscience in all
parts of our nation and the world -- to act more prophetically for more
humane relations with our neighbors in Cuba.

This memo is an overview of the most recent developments in the
continuing campaign of IFCO/Pastors for Peace to deliver to Cuba,
without a license, the medical computers which U.S. Customs seized
from our volunteers in San Diego on January 31st and February 17th.

We are pleased to tell you that the computers in San Diego have been
RELEASED!!!!  

THANKS BE TO GOD WHO, WITH OUR HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS,  GAVE US THE VICTORY!!!

At 11pm on Friday, May 24th, day 94 of the Fast for Life, Dr. Thom
White Wolf Fassett, General Secretary of the General Board of Church
and Society of the United Methodist Church, signed an agreement with
the U.S. Treasury to achieve the release of the computers into the
custody of the General Board of Church and Society.  Dr. Fassett
authorized two local Methodist pastors in San Diego, The Rev. John
Lurvey and The Rev. James Jones, to act as his representatives.  Revs.
Jones and Lurvey supervised the transfer of the computers to a storage
facility rented by the Board of Church and Society.  The keys for the
storage facility are now in the pastors' possession.

At midnight on Friday, May 24 -- day 94 of the Fast for Life --  Rev.
Lucius Walker, Lisa Valanti and Jim Clifford ended their fast in a brief
service of celebration and thanksgiving in the Methodist Building. 

YOUR EFFORTS HAVE MADE THE DIFFERENCE!!!  BUT THE
CAMPAIGN IS NOT OVER.  WE HAVE COMPLETED ONLY
TWO STEPS OF A FIVE STEP PROCESS -- AND WHILE
NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE, WE MUST KEEP THE PRESSURE
ON!!!  


STEP ONE  -  RELEASE OF THE CANADIAN COMPUTERS
SEIZED IN SAN DIEGO 

On Friday, May 17th, the Canadian computers seized in San Diego
were released to the General Board of Church and Society of the
United Methodist Church and taken to a storage facility in Mexico. 
That evening Brian Rohatyn, the Canadian faster, ended his fast.

STEP TWO  -  RELEASE OF THE U.S. COMPUTERS SEIZED
IN SAN DIEGO 

On Friday, May 24th, the U.S. computers seized in San Diego on
January 31st & February 17th were released into the custody of the
General Board of Church & Society of the United Methodist Church
and put into storage in San Diego pending continued negotiations for
their transfer to Cuba.  Rev. Lucius Walker, Jr., James Clifford and
Lisa Valanti ended their 94-day fast that night.


STEP THREE  -  RELEASE INTO CANADA OF THE 35
COMPUTERS SEIZED AT HIGHGATE, VERMONT ON
FEBRUARY 17th 

On February 17th, Canadian and U.S. citizens attempted to donate 35
computers to Cuba by crossing the U.S./Canadian border at Highgate,
Vermont.  The computers were seized.  THESE COMPUTERS CAN
BE RELEASED THIS WEEK IF WE KEEP THE PRESSURE ON
THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND THE WHITE
HOUSE!    

STEP FOUR  -   TRANSFER TO MEXICO OF THE
COMPUTERS NOW IN CUSTODY OF THE GENERAL BOARD
OF CHURCH & SOCIETY OF THE  UNITED METHODIST
CHURCH WHICH ARE BEING HELD IN STORAGE IN SAN
DIEGO

These computers must be transferred to Mexico in preparation for
shipment to Cuba.  In the spirit of the negotiations between the Board
of Church and Society and the Treasury Department, it is likely that
this transfer could happen in a matter of days.  BUT TO INSURE
THIS TRANSFER WE ARE ASKING ALL OUR SUPPORTERS TO
KEEP THE PRESSURE ON BOTH THE TREASURY
DEPARTMENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE!!!

On a previous occasion U.S. Treasury agents broke into a private
storage locker and stole crutches and baby formula which we were
storing for a future caravan.  We know that another break-in is a
possibility; therefore, we must KEEP THE PRESSURE ON UNTIL
THE COMPUTERS ARE TRANSFERRED TO MEXICO!!!

STEP FIVE -   DELIVERY OF ALL THE COMPUTERS -- FROM
CANADA AND MEXICO -- TO CUBA

This caravan (Friendshipment VI) will not be complete until the 395
computers are delivered to the churches, clinics and hospitals in Cuba. 
The General Board of Church and Society will announce the date for
the delivery of the computers to Cuba; probably in June 1996.

As you can see, the campaign is not complete just because the fast is
ended.  The fasters were able to end their fast only because they felt
confident that you would not stop working for the completion of the
campaign.  WE PLEAD WITH YOU TO KEEP CALLING:

THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT:   SECRETARY RUBIN:
     202/622-1100 or -1080

THE WHITE HOUSE: LEON PANETTA:     202/456-6797

THANK THEM FOR THE POSITIVE STEPS WHICH HAVE BEEN
TAKEN -- AND INSIST THAT THE COMPUTERS BE ALLOWED
PASSAGE TO CUBA WITHOUT A LICENSE.

DON'T STOP NOW!  ONLY WITH YOUR CONTINUED
PARTICIPATION IN KEEPING UP THE PRESSURE WILL WE
SOON CELEBRATE SUCCESS!!  IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL THE
COMPUTERS ARE IN CUBA!!


We also ask that you write or fax MESSAGES OF THANKS AND
COMMENDATION to:

CONGRESSMAN CHARLES RANGEL, for his courage, his
heartfelt commitment, and his tireless leadership in mediating this
agreement with Treasury.  His address is:
     
Congressman Charles Rangel, Rayburn Building, Washington, D.C.
20515
 
DR. THOM WHITE WOLF FASSETT, for giving strong
ecumenical leadership in resolving this matter, for hosting the fasters,
and for making the commitment to send the computers to Cuba without
requesting a license!  His address is:   

     Dr. Thom White Wolf Fassett, General Secretary, General
Board of Church and Society, United Methodist Church, 100 Maryland
Avenue, NE, Washington, DC 20002


         
*****************************************************


IFCO would like to take this opportunity to express its profound
appreciation to Dr. Thom Fassett in particular, to the Board of Church
and Society in general, and to all of our ecumenical partners for their
efforts in achieving the successful resolution which will lead us to the
victory!  

For their prophetic vision and strong support, we give thanks to:

The Most Rev. Edmond L. Browning, Presiding Bishop of the
Episcopal Church 
Dr. Bennett W. Smith, Sr., President, Progressive National Baptist
Convention
Dr. Aidsand Wright-Riggins, Director, National Ministries, American
Baptist Churches/USA
Dr. Joan Brown Campbell, General Secretary, National Council of
Churches of Christ
Dr. Randolph Nugent, General Secretary, General Board of Church
and Society, United      Methodist Church
Bishop Richard O. Bass, Ecumenical Officer, Christian Methodist
Episcopal Church


      ****************************************************


Finally, let us all remember the next phase of the long-range work
which remains before us.  During the 94 days of the Fast for Life, we
have witnessed the beginning of a powerful new coalition: a new, more
mainstream coalition which is committed to working for an end to the
U.S. blockade of Cuba and for normalization of U.S./Cuba relations. 
For our future work, we can count on the nation's most influential

PRESS CONFERENCE     
Thursday,  May 30,      11:30 a.m.
Rayburn House Office Building, Room B318

An historic 94-day fast by Rev. Lucius Walker, Lisa Valanti and Jim
Clifford ended in victory on 5/24 when the Treasury Department agreed
to release 360 used medical computers which it had seized in January and
February when IFCO/Pastors for Peace volunteers attempted to take
them to Cuba without a license.  The computers have been released to the
custody of the General Board of Church and Society of the United
Methodist Church, which expects to be able to ship them soon to Cuba --
without requesting a license.

In a time when the U.S. government is tightening restrictions against
Cuba, more than 70 members of Congress have spoken out for the release
of these computers, and for easing of the blockade on humanitarian aid to
Cuba.  They represent one facet of a broad new coalition -- which also
includes mainline religious denominations, labor and professional groups,
Cuban-American groups and hundreds of thousands of grassroots citizens
-- who favor easing or ending U.S. aid and trade restrictions against
Cuba.

SPEAKERS will include:

REP. CHARLES A. RANGEL (D-NY), who was instrumental in
mediating the agreement between Treasury and the United Methodist
Church for release of the computers;

REPS. SAM FARR (D-CA), JERROLD NADLER (D-NY), MAJOR
OWENS (D-NY), NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MARTIN SABO (D-
MN), ESTEBAN TORRES (D-NY), MIKE WARD (D-KY),
MAXINE WATERS (D-CA), and others of the 70 members of
Congress who actively advocated to the Treasury Department and the
Clinton Administration for release of the computers;

REV. LUCIUS WALKER, JR., Executive Director of the Interreligious
Foundation for Community Organization (IFCO)/Pastors for Peace, who
just completed a 94-day fast to secure the release of the computers; and 

DR. THOM WHITE WOLF FASSETT, General Secretary of the
General Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist Church,
which took custody of the IFCO/Pastors for Peace computers and which
intends -- along with other national church agencies -- to send the
computers to Cuban health care facilities without requesting a license.

CHILDREN NOW UPDATE
May 28, 1996
*******************




1.  QUOTE OF THE WEEK
"Teachers and students aren't defined geographically, <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a> education isn't
determined by where you live or how much money you have."  Tom Layton,
teacher at CyberSchool in Eugene, Oregon, on high school students earning
credit on the Internet.  From USA Today, May 8, 1996.


2. EDUCATION POLL
A recent week-long series of articles in USA Today highlighted the state of
education in the U.S. The series featured a poll conducted by the newspaper
of both public elementary and secondary school parents and students.  Among
the most often mentioned complaints were overcrowding, dirty restrooms,
classroom temperature, computer time, substandard science labs, and rundown
gyms and fields.  38% of parents say their child's school is too crowded
while 30% say that the school's computers don't meet their children's
needs.  Secondary school students biggest complaint was that there was not
enough computer time for students (55%). Elementary students echoed that
sentiment as 42% said there wasn't enough computer time.

The USA Today series "A Quest for Excellence" series ran May 13, 1996
through May 17, 1996.  The results of the poll, which was done by USA
Today, appeared May 14, 1996


3.  CHILD SUPPORT:
A recent report by child advocates found that California's child support
system is worsening in both effectiveness and efficiency, thus failing to
serve most of the 3.5 million children involved in its child support
system.  Past Due:  Child Support Collection in California -- a report by
Children Now, National Center for Youth Law and the Child Support Reform
Initiative --found that California's child support collections dropped by
30% in the past five years.  The report called for moving collection
responsibility from the 58 county District Attorneys to the state Franchise
Tax Board and for adopting a unified, statewide administrative process to
handle more of the cases outside of the courts.

The report notes that an effective child support enforcement system would
reduce both the number of families who rely on welfare and the nation's
high rate of children living in poverty.

For more information, contact Amy Abraham, Children Now at 1-800-CHILD-44
or Leora Gershenzon, National Center for Youth Law at (415) 543-3307.


4.  THESE CHILDREN HAVE FACES
The organization, "These Children Have Faces" was started by a St. Paul
woman who was concerned and angry about proposed budget cuts of the 104th
Congress.  She called together a group of friends and activists to come up
with a positive idea of what they could do.  They came up with a simple and
effective plan--to collect photos of children from people who love them,
deliver the photos to Congress and make sure the senders register and vote
in November, 1996.

"These Children Have Faces" is working with the Coalition of America's
Children (which represents 300 national organizations including the
Children's Defense Fund, Junior League, PTA, Kiwanis, and Children Now) and
is hoping to gather hundreds of thousands of photographs of children in an
effort to persuade Congress to rethink proposed cuts in funding for
programs that aid low-income children.

To participate in the program, simply send in a picture, a note about the
child in the picture and a $1 contribution.  You are also welcome to make
additional contributions.

Please make checks payable to Women's Consortium and mail to:

These Children Have Faces
46 East Fourth Street, Suite 830
St. Paul, MN 55101

Be sure to write your name, address and phone number and sign it indicating
that the picture (no name or address) may be sent to Congress and/or the
State Legislature.

5.  MEDIA CONFERENCE
In early May, Children Now convened a group of the top television
advertisers in the nation to discuss their role in improving the quality of
television watched by children.  The conference focused on how advertisers
can and do influence the content of full-length programming, including
shows made especially for children as well as prime time and afternoon
shows watched by kids.

Our gathering, held at Stanford University May 1-3, also included
television producers, network executives, representatives from advertising
agencies, academics, and children's advocates.  FCC Chairman Reed Hundt,
Disney/ABC Cable president Geraldine Laybourne and Harvard University child
psychiatrist Alvin Poussaint all addressed attendees.  A full report from
the conference will be available in early July.


6.  TEEN PREGNANCY AND CHILD ABUSE
In a recent report, Bronwyn Mayden, director of the Child Welfare League of
America (CWLA), argues that there is a connection between teen pregnancy
and child abuse and that little has been written about the impact of child
sexual abuse on the victim's long-term development, physical and emotional
health, sexual identity, and reproductive decisions.  Mayden cites a 1992
report by the American Medical Association that estimates 61% of all U.S.
victims of sexual assault are under the age of 18, proving that most of the
sexual violence that occurs in this country is directed against children.
U.S. Bureau of Justice figures for the same year revealed that one of every
six rape victims is under 12, and 80% of all sexual assaults against
children are committed by family members, friends, and acquaintances.
Mayden states that compared to their non-abused counterparts, young women
who have been abused initiate sexual activity at a younger age, are more
sexually active, and are less likely to use contraception.  The predictable
result is too-early childbearing.

-------------- Enclosure number 1 ----------------
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher
2201 C. St. NW
Washington, D.C.  20520



Dear Sir,

     We, the undersigned wish to express a high level of concern
about the growing crisis in Mexico and the real possibility of
the outbreak of hostilities once again in the southeast state of
Chiapas.  The growing evidence of human rights violations, links
to drug trafficking on a high governmental level, and the
continued impunity of paramilitary groups, have provoked a
massive exodus of families seeking relief from the political and
economic crisis.
     Because Mexico is our closest neighbor in Latin America we
cannot remain silent before the consequences of this crisis.  We
therefore request the response of the State Department in terms
of the following issues;

      1) We understand that Mexico is receiving substantial
military equipment  from the United States.  Although the
objective of these sales is said to be aid in the drug war, we
request information about the guarantees which exist that this
equipment will not be used for other purposes such as
counterinsurgency  and government responses to civil unrest.
This equipment includes the recent sale of 73 Huey helicopters.
We are also interested in clearly understanding the current
working relationships to both train the Mexican military and
replace any weapons ten years or older for the Mexican Army.
     2) We request any current information on the state of
human
rights in Mexico.  Specifically we need to know current
governmental responses to paramilitary groups and/or "deaths
quads", and to the protection of the human rights of the 18
individuals presently jailed under accusation of being members
of the rebel group in Chiapas, the Zapatistas.
     3)  We request any information which the State Department
may have about the possible breakdown of the peace talks in
Chiapas, Mexico.

     We strongly affirm our commitment to a peaceful solution
and a transition to democracy for Mexico.  We do not believe
that our southern border can bear the economic and humanitarian
brunt of a growing and debilitating political and economic
crisis in Mexico. We urge your prompt response and look forward
to policies which strengthen the possibilities for peace in
Mexico.  Thank you for your attention.

Respectfully,




.

         MEMBERS OF CONGRESS PRAISE  FASTERS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS.
     ENCOURAGE  ARRIVAL OF COMPUTERS IN CUBA FOLLOWING RELEASE FROM U.S. CUSTOMS.
 
              Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY) and many congressional colleagues gathered
at a Washington press conference on Thursday to celebrate the
conclusion of the 94-day  Fast for Life  waged by Pastors for Peace.  The
fast, led by Rev. Lucius Walker, ended last Friday after the Treasury
Department released the used medical computers seized by U.S. Customs
in January and February en route to Cuba.  Pastors for Peace, who
consider the U.S. economic blockade of Cuba as immoral, was taking this
humanitarian aid, without requesting a license, to Cuban clinics and
hospitals. 

On behalf of his colleagues, Rangel thanked the fasters and the religious
leaders who supported them for  allowing us to have the opportunity to
participate in what was a moral and spiritual adventure.  Your sacrifice
and courage was a victory for morality over politics.  Like most
Americans, I don t believe that we should hurt God s children for a
couple of votes.    Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) elaborated,  Why does it
take a group of conscientious citizens nearly starving themselves to death
at the doorstep of our nation s capitol to bring a little reason to our
foreign policy?   Nadler, one of more than 70 members of Congress, who
advocated for the release of the medical equipment, is the sponsor of
legislation that would end the U.S. embargo on medicines, medical
supplies and equipment.     Depriving citizens of medicine is not moral, it
is not right and it is inconsistent with the values of the American people ,
he added.

Rep. Rangel also noted how impressed he was with  the strong support of
the many national religious denominations who came forward to offer
their help.  This is the making of a new ecumenical coalition to address
the moral issues around our policy on Cuba.    

Dr. Thom White Wolf Fassett, General Secretary of the General Board of
Church and Society of the United Methodist Church was present on
behalf of the consortium of religious associations.  Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-
CA) explained that  the computers have been released to the United
Methodist Church, who now hold title, until their expected shipment to
Cuba.    Fassett, who has ensured their transport, told reporters that he
will keep U.S.  officials advised as to how the computers are being used. 
He stated that the United Methodist Church has  supplied the Treasury
Department with information related to the use of the computers in the
Cuban health-care system that qualifies their humanitarian use.   He
thanked Treasury Secretary Rubin and Assistant Secretary Johnson for
 their support and their openness and approachability to discuss and
resolve this issue. 

All of the members of Congress who were present joined Rep. Rangel in
urging the Treasury Department to move quickly to facilitate delivery of
the medical equipment.  Said Rangel,  We have every confidence that the
Treasury Department will not stand in the way of allowing these
computers to arrive in Cuba. 

Rev. Walker expressed sincere thanks on behalf of his fellow fasters to
the members of Congress, religious leaders and thousands of grassroots
supporters.   Together, we have accomplished a lot with this fast.  We
have given new hope to the Cuban people on behalf of all Americans who
work for peace in the world.   ###

ACTION ALERT


1)  You can be a significant help in our continuing quest to
get the story of the Fast for Life into the mainstream media. 
We want to ask you to help us place an article about the Fast
in your most important local media outlet.  We're even
supplying you with the article:  a well-written, sympathetic,
comprehensive and articulate piece by Askia Muhammad
(writer/commentator/reporter for Pacifica, NPR, and several
print media outlets; you may have heard his recent commentary
on the Fast which played on Monitor Radio).  We think Askia's
article is a strong representation of this campaign, and we'd
be pleased to have it receive broad circulation.    

If you are receiving this message via e-mail, the Askia
Muhammad article follows.  If you don't have e-mail
capability, we will fax the article to you if you will call
us and let us know that you want to receive it.  Since it's
4 pages long, we'd rather not winfax to everyone; but we'll
gladly send it if you can use it!  
(We're also working on completing an op-ed piece about the
Fast.  Call us in Washington -- 202/488-5646 or -5654 (phone)
or 202/886-7369 (pager) -- if you think you can place an op-
ed piece in your local paper.)


2)  KEEP CALLING WASHINGTON!!!
We still want to be optimistic about steps 3 and 4 -- the
release of the Highgate computers and the transfer of the San
Diego computers into Mexico -- BUT THESE STEPS WON'T HAPPEN
UNLESS THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT KNOWS WE'RE STILL OUT HERE
KEEPING THE PRESSURE ON.  Ask everyone you know to make a
commitment to make A PHONE CALL EVERY DAY TO TREASURY.

     Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin  202/622-1100, -1080
     White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta  202/456-6797
	(DNC # and state chairs?-jm)


3)  TODAY'S NEWS FROM WASHINGTON:  a wonderful press
conference affirming the Fast, called by Rep. Charles A. Rangel and attended by Reps.
Bill Coyne (D-PA), Sam Farr (D-CA), Maurice Hinchey (D-NY),
Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Jose Serrano (D-
NY), Esteban Torres (D-CA), Mike Ward (D-KY), Maxine Waters
(D-CA).  Let's continue to thank supportive congressional
reps for their work!

4) We need to make A CORRECTION to our last action alert --
the three-page document which describes the five steps of our
campaign to get the computers released.  On page 3, where the
participating church partners are listed, there's an important 
error which we want to correct.  Please note that
Dr. Randolph Nugent is general secretary of the GENERAL BOARD
OF GLOBAL MINISTRIES of the United Methodist Church, NOT the
General Board of Church and Society.  Global Ministries is
a distinct board of the United Methodist Church, which is
headquartered in New York, and which has given substantial
support to IFCO through the years of our history.  Their
omission was a typo brought on by sleep deprivation; we
certainly want to affirm their participation in this historic
agreement and in all of IFCO's work.  PLEASE make this
correction in your copy of this five-step document; and if
you plan to make copies or distribute the document in any
way, please call us in Washington -- 202/488-5646 or -5654
(phone) or 202/886-7369 (pager) -- and let us fax you a
corrected copy!  
THANKS.

Pastors For Peace--5-29-96


Fasting Pastors for Peace
Win Release of Computers

by Askia Muhammad

     WASHINGTON--Republican Presidential
candidate Bob Dole easily made headlines in Miami
recently by promising to: "bring Fidel Castro
down and end his reign of terror."  Less than a
week later, a Black Baptist preacher and two
companions ended a vigil in near obscurity,
literally in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol,
claiming victory in their effort to help Mr.
Castro's island nation.

     At midnight, Saturday morning May 25 (9:00
p.m. Pacific Time May 24), the end of Day 94 of
their "Fast for Life," the Rev. Lucius Walker,
Jr., leader of Pastors for Peace (PFP), Lisa
Valanti and Jim Clifford savored a rice broth at
a special service of thanksgiving surrounded by
religious leaders, congressional staff aides, and
members of their support team.

     At that moment 374 computers destined for
Cuban hospitals and health clinics were being
released to the custody of the General Board of
Church and Society of the United Methodist Church
(UMC) at a private storage facility maintained by
the U.S. Customs Agency in San Diego.

     "We are thankful to God and to the hundreds
of thousands of supporters who never gave up the
struggle to free the computers," the Rev. Walker
said as he ended his fast.  The hunger strike had
begun Feb. 21, to protest the seizure of 397
outmoded and obsolete by U.S. standards "286" and
"XT" computers by Customs officials in late
January.

     "Together we have made an effort to appeal
to the soul and integrity of our nation," he
said.  "Our efforts have not been in vain, but
much work remains.  The new broad coalition which
has grown around the Fast will keep working to
send these computers on to Cuba.  And as the
coalition grows, we will keep working together
for a more humane policy toward Cuba.

     "The release of these computers was made
possible by the active support of hundreds of
thousands of people of conscience in all parts of
the U.S.," the Rev. Walker said, expressing
"special gratitude for the committed work of
Congressman Charles A. Rangel (D-NY), whose
tireless advocacy helped seal this victory."

     Just one week earlier, 23 other computers
were released.  All of the first machines
released are of Canadian origin and are stored 
in Mexico in preparation for shipment to Cuba.

     Treasury Department and Customs officials
had insisted that PFP or some other group apply
for and receive an export license, even if the
Rev. Walker and his group refused to do <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a>.  The
agreement for their release calls for a coalition
of national church partners to store the
computers in the U.S. pending completion of
arrangements to transfer them to Cuba without
requesting a license.  The coalition includes six
national mainline denominations and the National
Council of Churches.

     "We are optimistic that this medical aid
will soon be exported for humanitarian use in
Cuba," Dr. Thom White Wolf Fassett, General
Secretary of the UMC General Board of Church and
Society, said. 

     In a May 17 letter to Rep. Rangel, who
mediated the dialogue between PFP and the
government, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
expressed concern for the welfare of those
participating in the fast and said that within
the existing laws, there are "procedural avenues"
available for the Rev. Walker to achieve his
goals, and end the fast.

     "The U.S. government has pursued a policy of
death pursuant to Cuba for more than half of my
life," the Rev. Walker said, at a Capitol Hill
press conference May 2, explaining why he was <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a>
adamant.  He was flanked by Reps. Charles Rangel
(D-NY), Sam Farr (D-CA), Esteban Torres (D-CA),
William Coyne (D-PA), and by staff members from
the offices of Reps. Ron Dellums (D-CA) and Bobby
Rush (D-IL), some of more than 70 members of
Congress who signed letters to support the "Fast
for Life."

     "People have to make a decision whether or
not they will be complicit with the policy of
death toward Cuba. I refuse to be complicit. I
would rather give my life engaging in this
simplest act of kindness, rather than lose my
soul," he said.

     The donated computers will be used to help
build an on-line medical information network for
the island nation, which already boasts a health
care system that is considered a "model" by
health professionals. The exemplary medical
system may be one reason why U.S. officials have
been <a name=L10003></a><a href=#L10004>so</a> inflexible, according to one health
source.

     "It is often said that Cuba is no longer a
threat to the U.S.," Diane Kuntz, Staff Associate
for International Health for the 50,000-member
American Public Health Association (APHA), said
in a statement. Cuba, she said, "is a threat. The
threat is the example Cuba offers of a country
with the political will to provide good health
care to all its citizens.

     "The U.S. is fighting this threat, using
food, medicine and medical supplies as weapons. 
The computers that were confiscated are vital 
components of Cuba's health care system. Many of 
the computers were donated by members of the 
American Public Health Association."

     Racism, plain and simple, is at the root of
U.S. hatred of Cuba, the Rev. Walker, pastor of
Salvation Baptist Church in Brooklyn, NY,
insists, and that's one of the reasons he refuses
to comply with the U.S. embargo by applying for
an export license for items intended for
humanitarian aid.

     On five previous occasions the Rev. Walker
has waged the same struggle with federal
officials. The last confrontation was resolved in
1993 when the government relented after PFP
staged a 23-day hunger strike on board a little
yellow school bus. Customs officials had seized
the bus at a Texas-Mexico border crossing as the
group attempted to ship it to a church in Cuba.

     "It's like Dr. (Martin Luther) King, (Jr.)
and the civil rights movement not being willing
to comply with Jim Crow laws," the Rev. Walker
said of his adamant stand. "I do not apply (for
export licenses) because I do not want to break
the law...the higher law, the moral law of the
universe."

     The U.S. he said, is signatory to the Geneva
accords--the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights--which says that food, medicine, medical
supplies, and other humanitarian aid are not to
be used as weapons.

     "This war against Cuba is a race war," the
Rev. Walker said in an interview, because the
majority of the Cuban population is actually
Afro-Cuban. The majority of the politically
influential anti-Castro Cuban exile community in
Florida, he insists, is made up of white Cubans
who fled when Mr. Castro took power. "If Cuba
were white there would not be a blockade. If
there was one, it would have been over years ago.

     "What crime has Cuba committed? Is it that
the first act of the Cuban government under
Castro's leadership was to officially outlaw
racism? Was its sin that it put the Mafia out and
wouldn't let them rape and exploit the poor? Or
was its sin that it decided to give universal
free education to all Cubans, including Blacks?
Was the sin that it decided to give universal
free health care?" he asked rhetorically.

     "What did Cuba do wrong to deserve this? If
these acts are sins then the U.S. should commit
the same sins." The U.S. travel ban, he said, is
designed to keep people in this country,
especially Blacks, from seeing these truths for
themselves.

     The APHA agrees. "The U.S. national grudge
against Cuba--exemplified by the (1993 and 1996)
tightening of the embargo--is out of step with the 
changes occurring in the
world. The embargo's interference in the Cuban
people's access to food and medicine is
tantamount to the use of food and medicine as a
weapon in the U.S. arsenal against Cuba," APHA
concludes in its report "The Politics of
Suffering: the Impact of the U.S. Embargo on the
Health of the Cuban People."

     By contrast, the Rev. Walker compares
China's status as a Most Favored Nation trading
partner, despite the tens of thousands of
casualties China inflicted on U.S. troops during
the Korean War, and the fast track toward
diplomatic and trade normalization for Vietnam,
despite 58,000 body bags containing U.S. military
personnel sent back from that conflict.

     There have been no U.S. casualties in the
U.S.-Cuban conflict, he said. "When Black folks
realize that this blockade is racist, and that it
affects our `Uncles' and `Aunts' in Cuba, and
then start writing (President Bill) Clinton...
when our Black organizations--the NAACP and
Minister Farrakhan--stand up for Cuba, that will
make the difference."

     The Fast for Life, the Rev. Walker said,
gained many allies in the Christian community,
drawing support from many mainstream
denominations. Representatives of the Progressive
National Baptist Convention, the General Board of
Church and Society of the United Methodist
Church, the Alliance of Baptists, the American
Baptist Churches/USA, the Episcopal Church, the
General Board of Global Ministries of the United
Methodist Church, and the National Council of
Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. have all signed
letters of support.

     "There should be more Jews out here. There
should be more nuns out here. There should be
more Muslims out here," Rep. Rangel said at the
Capitol Hill press conference. "We need more
religious people out here to do the right thing
for Cuba. Our government should not be in the
business of denying humanitarian support to sick
people."

ACTION ALERT


1)  You can be a significant help in our continuing quest to
get the story of the Fast for Life into the mainstream media. 
We want to ask you to help us place an article about the Fast
in your most important local media outlet.  We're even
supplying you with the article:  a well-written, sympathetic,
comprehensive and articulate piece by Askia Muhammad
(writer/commentator/reporter for Pacifica, NPR, and several
print media outlets; you may have heard his recent commentary
on the Fast which played on Monitor Radio).  We think Askia's
article is a strong representation of this campaign, and we'd
be pleased to have it receive broad circulation.    

If you are receiving this message via e-mail, the Askia
Muhammad article follows.  If you don't have e-mail
capability, we will fax the article to you if you will call
us and let us know that you want to receive it.  Since it's
4 pages long, we'd rather not winfax to everyone; but we'll
gladly send it if you can use it!  
(We're also working on completing an op-ed piece about the
Fast.  Call us in Washington -- 202/488-5646 or -5654 (phone)
or 202/886-7369 (pager) -- if you think you can place an op-
ed piece in your local paper.)


2)  KEEP CALLING WASHINGTON!!!
We still want to be optimistic about steps 3 and 4 -- the
release of the Highgate computers and the transfer of the San
Diego computers into Mexico -- BUT THESE STEPS WON'T HAPPEN
UNLESS THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT KNOWS WE'RE STILL OUT HERE
KEEPING THE PRESSURE ON.  Ask everyone you know to make a
commitment to make A PHONE CALL EVERY DAY TO TREASURY.

     Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin  202/622-1100, -1080
     White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta  202/456-6797
	(DNC # and state chairs?-jm)


3)  TODAY'S NEWS FROM WASHINGTON:  a wonderful press
conference affirming the Fast, called by Rep. Charles A. Rangel and attended by Reps.
Bill Coyne (D-PA), Sam Farr (D-CA), Maurice Hinchey (D-NY),
Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Jose Serrano (D-
NY), Esteban Torres (D-CA), Mike Ward (D-KY), Maxine Waters
(D-CA).  Let's continue to thank supportive congressional
reps for their work!

4) We need to make A CORRECTION to our last action alert --
the three-page document which describes the five steps of our
campaign to get the computers released.  On page 3, where the
participating church partners are listed, there's an important 
error which we want to correct.  Please note that
Dr. Randolph Nugent is general secretary of the GENERAL BOARD
OF GLOBAL MINISTRIES of the United Methodist Church, NOT the
General Board of Church and Society.  Global Ministries is
a distinct board of the United Methodist Church, which is
headquartered in New York, and which has given substantial
support to IFCO through the years of our history.  Their
omission was a typo brought on by sleep deprivation; we
certainly want to affirm their participation in this historic
agreement and in all of IFCO's work.  PLEASE make this
correction in your copy of this five-step document; and if
you plan to make copies or distribute the document in any
way, please call us in Washington -- 202/488-5646 or -5654
(phone) or 202/886-7369 (pager) -- and let us fax you a
corrected copy!  
THANKS.

Pastors For Peace--5-29-96


Fasting Pastors for Peace
Win Release of Computers

by Askia Muhammad

     WASHINGTON--Republican Presidential
candidate Bob Dole easily made headlines in Miami
recently by promising to: "bring Fidel Castro
down and end his reign of terror."  Less than a
week later, a Black Baptist preacher and two
companions ended a vigil in near obscurity,
literally in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol,
claiming victory in their effort to help Mr.
Castro's island nation.

     At midnight, Saturday morning May 25 (9:00
p.m. Pacific Time May 24), the end of Day 94 of
their "Fast for Life," the Rev. Lucius Walker,
Jr., leader of Pastors for Peace (PFP), Lisa
Valanti and Jim Clifford savored a rice broth at
a special service of thanksgiving surrounded by
religious leaders, congressional staff aides, and
members of their support team.

     At that moment 374 computers destined for
Cuban hospitals and health clinics were being
released to the custody of the General Board of
Church and Society of the United Methodist Church
(UMC) at a private storage facility maintained by
the U.S. Customs Agency in San Diego.

     "We are thankful to God and to the hundreds
of thousands of supporters who never gave up the
struggle to free the computers," the Rev. Walker
said as he ended his fast.  The hunger strike had
begun Feb. 21, to protest the seizure of 397
outmoded and obsolete by U.S. standards "286" and
"XT" computers by Customs officials in late
January.

     "Together we have made an effort to appeal
to the soul and integrity of our nation," he
said.  "Our efforts have not been in vain, but
much work remains.  The new broad coalition which
has grown around the Fast will keep working to
send these computers on to Cuba.  And as the
coalition grows, we will keep working together
for a more humane policy toward Cuba.

     "The release of these computers was made
possible by the active support of hundreds of
thousands of people of conscience in all parts of
the U.S.," the Rev. Walker said, expressing
"special gratitude for the committed work of
Congressman Charles A. Rangel (D-NY), whose
tireless advocacy helped seal this victory."

     Just one week earlier, 23 other computers
were released.  All of the first machines
released are of Canadian origin and are stored 
in Mexico in preparation for shipment to Cuba.

     Treasury Department and Customs officials
had insisted that PFP or some other group apply
for and receive an export license, even if the
Rev. Walker and his group refused to do <a name=L10001></a><a href=#L10002>so</a>.  The
agreement for their release calls for a coalition
of national church partners to store the
computers in the U.S. pending completion of
arrangements to transfer them to Cuba without
requesting a license.  The coalition includes six
national mainline denominations and the National
Council of Churches.

     "We are optimistic that this medical aid
will soon be exported for humanitarian use in
Cuba," Dr. Thom White Wolf Fassett, General
Secretary of the UMC General Board of Church and
Society, said. 

     In a May 17 letter to Rep. Rangel, who
mediated the dialogue between PFP and the
government, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
expressed concern for the welfare of those
participating in the fast and said that within
the existing laws, there are "procedural avenues"
available for the Rev. Walker to achieve his
goals, and end the fast.

     "The U.S. government has pursued a policy of
death pursuant to Cuba for more than half of my
life," the Rev. Walker said, at a Capitol Hill
press conference May 2, explaining why he was <a name=L10002></a><a href=#L10003>so</a>
adamant.  He was flanked by Reps. Charles Rangel
(D-NY), Sam Farr (D-CA), Esteban Torres (D-CA),
William Coyne (D-PA), and by staff members from
the offices of Reps. Ron Dellums (D-CA) and Bobby
Rush (D-IL), some of more than 70 members of
Congress who signed letters to support the "Fast
for Life."

     "People have to make a decision whether or
not they will be complicit with the policy of
death toward Cuba. I refuse to be complicit. I
would rather give my life engaging in this
simplest act of kindness, rather than lose my
soul," he said.

     The donated computers will be used to help
build an on-line medical information network for
the island nation, which already boasts a health
care system that is considered a "model" by
health professionals. The exemplary medical
system may be one reason why U.S. officials have
been <a name=L10003></a><a href=#L10004>so</a> inflexible, according to one health
source.

     "It is often said that Cuba is no longer a
threat to the U.S.," Diane Kuntz, Staff Associate
for International Health for the 50,000-member
American Public Health Association (APHA), said
in a statement. Cuba, she said, "is a threat. The
threat is the example Cuba offers of a country
with the political will to provide good health
care to all its citizens.

     "The U.S. is fighting this threat, using
food, medicine and medical supplies as weapons. 
The computers that were confiscated are vital 
components of Cuba's health care system. Many of 
the computers were donated by members of the 
American Public Health Association."

     Racism, plain and simple, is at the root of
U.S. hatred of Cuba, the Rev. Walker, pastor of
Salvation Baptist Church in Brooklyn, NY,
insists, and that's one of the reasons he refuses
to comply with the U.S. embargo by applying for
an export license for items intended for
humanitarian aid.

     On five previous occasions the Rev. Walker
has waged the same struggle with federal
officials. The last confrontation was resolved in
1993 when the government relented after PFP
staged a 23-day hunger strike on board a little
yellow school bus. Customs officials had seized
the bus at a Texas-Mexico border crossing as the
group attempted to ship it to a church in Cuba.

     "It's like Dr. (Martin Luther) King, (Jr.)
and the civil rights movement not being willing
to comply with Jim Crow laws," the Rev. Walker
said of his adamant stand. "I do not apply (for
export licenses) because I do not want to break
the law...the higher law, the moral law of the
universe."

     The U.S. he said, is signatory to the Geneva
accords--the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights--which says that food, medicine, medical
supplies, and other humanitarian aid are not to
be used as weapons.

     "This war against Cuba is a race war," the
Rev. Walker said in an interview, because the
majority of the Cuban population is actually
Afro-Cuban. The majority of the politically
influential anti-Castro Cuban exile community in
Florida, he insists, is made up of white Cubans
who fled when Mr. Castro took power. "If Cuba
were white there would not be a blockade. If
there was one, it would have been over years ago.

     "What crime has Cuba committed? Is it that
the first act of the Cuban government under
Castro's leadership was to officially outlaw
racism? Was its sin that it put the Mafia out and
wouldn't let them rape and exploit the poor? Or
was its sin that it decided to give universal
free education to all Cubans, including Blacks?
Was the sin that it decided to give universal
free health care?" he asked rhetorically.

     "What did Cuba do wrong to deserve this? If
these acts are sins then the U.S. should commit
the same sins." The U.S. travel ban, he said, is
designed to keep people in this country,
especially Blacks, from seeing these truths for
themselves.

     The APHA agrees. "The U.S. national grudge
against Cuba--exemplified by the (1993 and 1996)
tightening of the embargo--is out of step with the 
changes occurring in the
world. The embargo's interference in the Cuban
people's access to food and medicine is
tantamount to the use of food and medicine as a
weapon in the U.S. arsenal against Cuba," APHA
concludes in its report "The Politics of
Suffering: the Impact of the U.S. Embargo on the
Health of the Cuban People."

     By contrast, the Rev. Walker compares
China's status as a Most Favored Nation trading
partner, despite the tens of thousands of
casualties China inflicted on U.S. troops during
the Korean War, and the fast track toward
diplomatic and trade normalization for Vietnam,
despite 58,000 body bags containing U.S. military
personnel sent back from that conflict.

     There have been no U.S. casualties in the
U.S.-Cuban conflict, he said. "When Black folks
realize that this blockade is racist, and that it
affects our `Uncles' and `Aunts' in Cuba, and
then start writing (President Bill) Clinton...
when our Black organizations--the NAACP and
Minister Farrakhan--stand up for Cuba, that will
make the difference."

     The Fast for Life, the Rev. Walker said,
gained many allies in the Christian community,
drawing support from many mainstream
denominations. Representatives of the Progressive
National Baptist Convention, the General Board of
Church and Society of the United Methodist
Church, the Alliance of Baptists, the American
Baptist Churches/USA, the Episcopal Church, the
General Board of Global Ministries of the United
Methodist Church, and the National Council of
Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. have all signed
letters of support.

     "There should be more Jews out here. There
should be more nuns out here. There should be
more Muslims out here," Rep. Rangel said at the
Capitol Hill press conference. "We need more
religious people out here to do the right thing
for Cuba. Our government should not be in the
business of denying humanitarian support to sick
people."

PEACE RELEASE, May 30, 1996

RE:   THE SYMBOL OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY

     Sunday, June 2, 1996, from 7:00 p.m. to midnight,  we will
be seeing out the 15th year of the current peace vigils along
Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House.   We have asked
Senator Rob Grams (R-MN), among others, to speak Sunday evening
about the closure of Pennsylvania Avenue.  There will be a
potluck, and people are encouraged to bring drums, musical
instruments and food, and stay to express their own concerns
about freedom.

     "There are barricades to the left of us, barricades to the
right of us, and yet directly in the middle sits what is supposed
to be one of this nation's most enduring symbols of freedom,"
Senator Grams stated May 20th, on the first anniversary of the
Avenue's closing.   "Surrounded by concrete, and ringed by armed
guards, dogs, and patrol vehicles, a roadway that once resonated
with freedom now reeks of fear."  Senator Grams has introduced a
bill to reopen Pennsylvania Avenue, S.R 254.  Please, actively
support it.

     Other questions are surfacing. 

     On May 29th Channel 7 News reported "a well orchestrated
plan to circumvent local politicians and keep the political
fallout to a minimum."   According to TV reporter Dell Walters, a
high ranking former official in the Reagan White House claims the
Secret Service "used national security as a bully pulpit to
orchestrate the closing of Pennylvania Avenue, America's main
street, by using safety of the president as a smokescreen."

     "The question being asked right now,"  Walters reported, "is
the legality of the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue and whether it
was done in a vacuum a secret deal, or whether that deal should
be discussed in the public.  Especially when we're talking about
America's Main Street."

     The American people need your help.   Raise your voice on
behalf of freedom from knee-jerk reactions.  When our vigil
ceases, take heed.   "If it's Pennsylvania Avenue today,"  Dell
Walters concluded, "how far do you go?  What's next?"

     How could this happen right under the Nose of the Free?   We
have some theories about that which will be unveiled June 2nd on
our Web Site, <a href=http://prop1.org/vigil.htm>http://prop1.org/vigil.htm</a> ....

PEACE RELEASE, May 30, 1996

RE:   THE SYMBOL OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY

     Sunday, June 2, 1996, from 7:00 p.m. to midnight,  we will
be seeing out the 15th year of the current peace vigils along
Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House.   We have asked
Senator Rob Grams (R-MN), among others, to speak Sunday evening
about the closure of Pennsylvania Avenue.  There will be a
potluck, and people are encouraged to bring drums, musical
instruments and food, and stay to express their own concerns
about freedom.

     "There are barricades to the left of us, barricades to the
right of us, and yet directly in the middle sits what is supposed
to be one of this nation's most enduring symbols of freedom,"
Senator Grams stated May 20th, on the first anniversary of the
Avenue's closing.   "Surrounded by concrete, and ringed by armed
guards, dogs, and patrol vehicles, a roadway that once resonated
with freedom now reeks of fear."  Senator Grams has introduced a
bill to reopen Pennsylvania Avenue, S.R 254.  Please, actively
support it.

     Other questions are surfacing. 

     On May 29th Channel 7 News reported "a well orchestrated
plan to circumvent local politicians and keep the political
fallout to a minimum."   According to TV reporter Dell Walters, a
high ranking former official in the Reagan White House claims the
Secret Service "used national security as a bully pulpit to
orchestrate the closing of Pennylvania Avenue, America's main
street, by using safety of the president as a smokescreen."

     "The question being asked right now,"  Walters reported, "is
the legality of the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue and whether it
was done in a vacuum a secret deal, or whether that deal should
be discussed in the public.  Especially when we're talking about
America's Main Street."

     The American people need your help.   Raise your voice on
behalf of freedom from knee-jerk reactions.  When our vigil
ceases, take heed.   "If it's Pennsylvania Avenue today,"  Dell
Walters concluded, "how far do you go?  What's next?"

     How could this happen right under the Nose of the Free?   We
have some theories about that which will be unveiled June 2nd on
our Web Site, <a href=http://prop1.org/vigil.htm>http://prop1.org/vigil.htm</a> ....

Convocatoria a la Jornada Mundial en Apoyo al "Dialogo de
San Andres".

El "Dialogo de San Andres", por la paz con justicia y
dignidad,
este en peligro. El gobierno mexicano ha dado claras senales
de su
intencion de romperlo, para asi justificar una salida
militar. La carencia
de propuestas y el bajo perfil de la delegacion
gubernamental a lo largo
de la Mesa 2 dedicada al tema "Democracia y Justicia", las
condenas a
Javier Elorriaga y Sebastian Entzin, presuntos zapatistas,
por los cargos
de terrorismo, la ambigiedad del poder ejecutivo al plantear
la forma de
revertir dichas condenas y la informacion calumniosa que
filtra el
gobierno a ciertos periodistas encargados de difamar la
causa de los
presuntos zapatistas, son prueba del intencional sabotaje
gubernamental al
proceso de paz. Las constantes y cada vez mas agresivas
incursiones
militares, la compra de equipos belicos y la proteccion a
los grupos
paramilitares que actuan en el estado de Chiapas, confirman
la intencion
del gobierno mexicano de justificar el reinicio de los
enfrentamientos
militares. Mientras la guerra de baja intensidad pasa a una
nueva etapa,
el gobierno mexicano ha lanzado un ultimatum diciendo que si
el EZLN no
acude a las negociaciones el proximo cinco de junio
reanudara la
persecucion judicial contra los zapatistas, lo cual
significaria de hecho
reaunudar la guerra.

Frente a esta grave situacion, el Ejercito Zapatista de
Liberacion
Nacional, ha declarado enfaticamente que, al no existir
condiciones
politicas minimas es imposible la continuacion del dialogo.
Por ello, ha
manifestado a la sociedad civil que si piensa hacer algo
para impedir la
solucion militar: a debe hacerlo ya!, exigiendo al gobierno
mexicano tomar
en serio el "Dialogo de San Andres".

Ante este momento crucial, entre la guerra y la paz,
Asesores e
Invitados del EZLN en el "Dialogo de San Andres" convocan a
los ciudadanos
del mundo, partidarios de una salida pacifica, justa y digna
de la guerra
en Chiapas, a realizar la 1a Jornada Mundial en apoyo al
"Dialogo de San
Andres", para exigir al gobierno crear las condiciones
necesarias para
alcanzar la paz. La Jornada se iniciara el proximo sabado 8
de junio
y continuara durante toda esa semana. Consistira en
movilizaciones simultaneas
frente a las embajadas y consulados mexicanos en todo el
mundo y en
multiples movilizaciones en Mexico. Comprendera ademas del
envio
de cartas al Presidente Ernesto Zedillo, 271-1764 (Fax) y
al Secretario de la Defensa Nacional, General Enrique
Cervantes. 395-2935
(Fax). Las principales demandas de esta Jornada seran:

 - El retiro de las tropas del ejercito mexicano a sus
cuarteles, en
cumplimiento del articulo 129 de la Constitucion mexicana,
el cese del
acoso a las comunidades chiapanecas y el envio de alimentos
a las
poblaciones ubicadas en la zona de conflicto, ya que el
acoso militar les
impidio sembrar.
- Retirar, por improcedentes los cargos de terrorismo Javier
Elorriaga y
Sebastian Entzin, y en consecuencia liberarlos de la carcel,
lo mismo que
a los otros 16 presuntos zapatistas presos.
- El reinicio de las platicas de paz, con una clara y
demostrable
decision de resolver los problemas que dieron origen al
levantamiento del
1o de enero de 1994.

Como simbolo de la Jornada proponemos soltar pequenos
"globos
aerostaticos" con un mensaje al EZLN que diga "No estan
solos", evocando
los globos enviados al mundo por los comuneros de Paris para
llamar a
defender la esperanza.

     Mucho agracederemos su participacion en estas Jornadas,
por la
vida y en contra de los actos guerreros del gobierno
mexicano.

     Ciudad de Mexico, a 23 de mayo de 1996.


     ASESORES E INVITADOS DEL EJERCITO ZAPATISTA DE
LIBERACION NACIONAL EN EL DIALOGO DE SAN ANDRES.
-------------------------------

          Call to action

International Week of Support for the San Andres Peace Talks
in Mexico

The San Andres Peace Talks for peace with justice and
dignity are in danger
of breaking down.  The Mexican government has clearly shown
its intention to
subvert the Peace Talks and to impose a military 'solution'
on the Zapatistas.

The Mexican government has not acted in good faith during
the second round
of Peace Talks on Democracy and Justice.  It has lacked
proposals for the Round
Table discussions, and the official government delegation is
composed of low
level bureaucrats who lack authority to negotiate in the
discussions.
Furthermore, even as it pretends to negotiate issues of
democracy and justice,
the Mexican government has arrested and condemned two
supposed Zapatistas -
Javier Elorriaga and Sebastian Entzin - to 14 years of jail
for unsubstantiated
charges of terrorism.  Both executive indecision on
reviewing this case and
leaks of slanderous information on the case from the
government to some
journalists who spread disinformation about the Elorriaga
and Entzin case are
part of an intentional government campaign to delegitimize
the Zapatistas'
position.

Menacing signs of the Mexican government's intention to
renew military
confrontation abound; constant and increasingly aggressive
military incursions
in Chiapas, purchase of military hardware, and the
protection of paramilitary
groups active in Chiapas.  While the low intensity warfare
reaches new levels of
activity, the Mexican government has imposed an ultimatum on
the Zapatistas.  If
the EZLN does not respond to government demands by June 5,
it will resume
judicial persecution of all presumed Zapatistas.  This is a
clear sign of the
Mexican government's transgression of the Peace Process and
a resumption of
a state of war.

In front of this serious situation, the Zapatista Army of
National Liberation
has declared that without even a minimal political will on
the part of the
government, it is impossible to continue a dialogue.  The
EZLN has told civil
society that if we want to do something to impede a military
solution - WE
MUST DO IT NOW!  We, civil society, must demand that the
government get serious about the San Andres Peace Talks.

At this crucial moment, between war and peace, the Advisors
and Observers for
the EZLN in the San Andres Peace Talks call all the citizens
of the world
interested in a peaceful, just and dignified solution to the
war in Chiapas, to
participate in and promote a Week of Support for the San
Andres Peace
Talks to pressure the Mexican government to create the
conditions necessary to reach a negotiated peace.

The Week of Support will begin Saturday, June 8, with
simultaneous
demonstrations for peace in front of Mexican embassies and
consulates through out the world, and with many
demonstrations throughout Mexico.  It will include sending
letters to:
     President Ernesto Zedillo     fax: (525)  271- 1764
     General Enrique Cervantes, Minister of National
Defense, (525)395-2935.

The principal demands of this week of Support are:
1. Withdrawal of Mexican army troops from Chiapas
communities and the retreat of Mexican army troops into
their barracks in fulfillment of Article 129 of the
Mexican Constitution.
2. Cessation of military harassment of Chiapas communities
and the delivery
of food and grains to the people living in the zone of
conflict; military action in
the area restricted farmers and peasants from planting their
subsistence crops
for the year.
3. Withdraw the unsubstantiated charges of terrorism against
Javier Elorriaga
and Sebastian Entzin, and free them from jail along with the
other 16 political
prisoners.
4. Reestablish the Peace Talks, with a clear and
demonstrable will to resolve
the problems that are at the root of the uprising of January
1, 1994.

As a symbol of the Week of Support, we propose that
participants launch
balloons in the air with the message to the EZLN saying "You
are NOT alone".  This action is reminiscent of the balloons
sent into the world by the members of the
communes of Paris in a call to defend their hope for a
better future.

Many thanks for your participation in the Week of Support,
in support of
life and against acts of war of the Mexican government.

Mexico City,

Group of Advisors and Observers of the EZLN in the San
Andres Peace Talks

Aufruf zur Internationalen Aktion zur Unterstuetzung des
"San Andres Dialog=
es"

Der "San Andres Dialog", das Dialog fuer einen wuerdigen und
gerechten
Frieden in Chiapas ist gerade in grosser Gefahr. Die
mexikanische
Regierung hat klare Zeichenge geben, den Dialog abzubrechen,
um eine
militarische Intervention gerechtfertigen zu koen nen. Die
mangelden
Vorschlaege und das niedrige Niveau der Regierungsdelegation
in der 2.
Verhandlungsphase (zum Thema "Demokratie und Gerechtigkeit")
der
Friedensgesprechaer; die Gerichtlicheverurteilungen von
Javier Elorriaga
und Sebastian Entzin, angeb liche Zapatisten, unter dem
Vorwurf des
Terrorismus; die unklare Stellungnahme der Exekutive zu
einer moeglichen
Ruecknahme der Verurteilung und die verleumderische
Berichterstattung
ueber den Fall in der mexikanischen Presse, beweisen die
intentionierte
Sabotagehaltung verschiedener Kreise gegen den
Friedensprozess. Die
staendigen und immer aggressiveren militaerischen Eingriffe,
die
Anschaffung neuer kriegerischen Ausruestung und der Schutz
der
paramilitaerische Gruppen der Region, belegen die Absicht
der
mexikanischen Regierung, erneute militaerische Aktionen
rechtfertigen zu
wollen. Waehrend der low-intensity Krieg auf einer hoeheren
Stufe angeland
ist, hat die mexikanische Regierung gleichzeitig das
Ultimatum gestellt,
dass wenn den Vertreter des Za patistischen Heeres sich
nicht zu den
Verhandlungen am 5. Juli einfinden,werden die gerichtlichen
Verfolgung
gegen die Zapatisten weitergehen. Das wuerde die
Wiederaufnahme des
Krieges bedeuten.=20

Angesichts dieser schweren Lage, hat die Zapatisten hat
nachdruecklich
erklaert dass, dass der Dialog nicht fortgesetzt werden
kann, solange wenn
die politischen Bedingungen nicht gegeben sind. Deswegen hat
das Ezln
ge=E4usert dass, wenn die politisch int eressierte
Gesellschaft etwas
unternehmen will, um die militarische Loesung zu verhindern,
muss sie das
jetzt tun, und um die mexikanische Regierung zu dr=E4ngen,
den Dialog Ernst
zu nehmen.=20

In dieser Situation zwischen Krieg und Frieden, rufen die
Berater und
Gaeste des EZLN im "San Andres Dialog" den Teil der
Weltbevoelkerung, ,
der eine friedige, gerechtige und wuerdige Loesung in
Chiapas
befuerwortet, dazu auf, die Internationalen Aktione n in
Unterstuetzung
zum "Dialogo de San Andres" zu organisieren. Diese Aktion
begint am 8.
Juni, mit Demonstrationen vor den mexikanischen Botschaften
und Konsulaten
in aller Welt und gleichzeitig verschiedenen Demostrationen
in Mexiko. Es
ist sehr wichti g, dass ihr Briefaktionen an den Presidenten
Ernesto
Zedillo (fax 271-1764) und des Verteidigungsminister General
Enrique
Cervantes (fax 395-2935)startet. Unsere wichtigsten
Forderungen sind:=20

- Der Rucksueck der Mexikanischen Armee in ihre Kassernen,
gemaess Artikel
129 des mexikanischen Grundgesetzes; schluss mit der
Belaestigung der
Bevoelkerung von Chiapas; die Sendung von Naehrungsmitteln
zur fuer die
Zivilbevoelkerung in der Konfliktzone,
 in der aufgrund der militaerischen Besetzung nicht geset
werden konnte.=20
- Das Zuruecknahme der Gerichtlichenanklage des Terrorismus,
und die
Freilassung Javier Elorreagas und Sebastian Entzins, und
aller anderen 16
angeblichen Zapatististen.=20
- Das Wiederaufnahme der Friedensverhandlungen,
und einer klaren und glauwuerdige Entscheidung der Regierung
die Probleme,
die den Konflikt hevorgerufen haben, zu loesen.=20

Als Symbol der Aktion, schlagen wir vor, kleine Luftballons,
mit der
Aufschrift "Ihr seid nicht allein", fliegenzulassen (im
Gedaechtins an die
Pariser Kommune und deren Aufruf die Hoffnung nicht zu
verlieren)

Wir bedanken uns herztlich fuer eure Teilnahme an dieser
Aktion fuer das
Leben und gegen den kriegerischen Umtriebe der Regierung.=20

Re: E-Mail Boycott Petition

As you know, during the month of June, we are supporting a "Boycott Chinese
Goods" program.  Students for a Free Tibet & many other organizations are
involved in this program as well. Very recently, I received a request from
the Milarepa Foundation to support an electronic petition drive. We have
agreed to this request. What follows is a statement & petition to accomplish
this. Please sign on to this petition by entering your name & returning your
endorsement to me. Simply e-mail me with your decision. Also, pass this
document on to others who will support the boycott & ask them to e-mail you
back with their support. When you have accumulated 50 names and/or by June
30, return your list of names to me.

Also contact President Clinton, Congress, and the Senate to voice your own
opinions.  A list of their e-mail addresses are below.

Thanks for your assistance.

BACKGROUND
In recognition of the brutal Chinese occupation of Tibet, and the continued
human rights violations in Tibet and China, an international consumer
boycott of all Chinese goods has been called for the entire month of June,
1996.

Since Tibet was invaded by China in 1950, the land and people of Tibet have
been systematically destroyed. Over 20% of the population (1.2 million
people) have been murdered, over 6000 monasteries have been destroyed, and
many hundreds of thousands of Tibetans remain in Chinese prisons simply for
exercising their religious, cultural and/or political beliefs. Similar
conditions exist in China as well. Amnesty International, Asia Watch, Laogai
Foundation and other Human Rights groups have reported  gross human rights
violations including forced prison labor.

Chinese prison labor camps produce a number of goods that we use in our
homes everyday. Though this is widely acknowledged and highly illegal, no
economic sanctions are levied against China. In fact, the United States
continues to renew China's Most Favored Nation trading status on a yearly
basis. While this directly  helps large corporations, it does nothing to
move China towards improving its human rights policies.  Consumers around the
world will demonstrate that they will not tolerate either a destruction of a
people or massive  human rights violations.  The one month boycott of Chinese
goods will send  a clear message to the world community, the business
community, and the present government of China.

This boycott is particularly timely since President Clinton just signed MFN &
congress now has 60 days to decide whether it supports this decision. It is
very critical that we contact the President & congress to share our views.
Congress appears to be leaning toward not supporting MFN & our input will
provide them with further evidence to make this decision.

Two alleged Mexican rebels freed on appeal

     TUXTLA GUTIERREZ- A judge acting of an appeal freed two
alleged Zapatista rebels from jail Thursday, opening the way
for stalled peace talks between the guerrillas and the
government to resume.
     Superior Court Judge Enrique Duran quashed the long
jail sentences for terrorism and rebellion imposed by a
lower court and set the men free, Uriel Jarguin, under-
secretary for government in the southern state of Chiapas,
told Reuters.
     The alleged rebels, Javier Elorriaga and Sebastian
Entzin, were sentenced May 2 to jail terms of 13 and six
years respectively.
     The appeal judge in the Chiapas state capital of Tuxtla
Gutierrez, 500 miles southeast of Mexico City, upheld a two-
year sentence for arms offenses against Entzin but freed him
of bail because he had already spent 16 months in jail.
     The harshness of the original verdicts, reached on the
basis of a written statement from a witness who never
appeared in court despite six summonses, provoked an angry
reaction from the Zapatista leadership.
     Rebel leader Subcommander Marcos said from his jungle
hideout June 1 that the Zapatistas would not resume stalled
peace talks with the government until the two men were
freed.
     Plans for a fresh round of talks June 5 were put on
hold and newspaper columnists speculated that the rebels
might be forced back into violence unless the tension eased.
     Marcos accused hard-liners in President Zedillo's
administration of provoking confrontation with the rebels,
suggesting they had engineered the court sentences to
undermine the peace negotiations.
     The government insisted that the justice process was
completely independent of the peace process and denied that
either the initial sentence or the freeing on appeal were
the result of any political pressure from Mexico City.
     Elorriaga and Entzin allegedly took part in the
uprising by Mayan Indians in the southern Mexican state of
Chiapas, where Zapatista rebels launched their revolt for
democracy and indigenous rights in January 1994.
     The two men had been in jail since February 1995, when
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo launched a crackdown
against the rebel forces.
     Elorriaga, a television journalist who also had served
as a go-between between Zedillo and the Zapatista guerrilla
leader Subcommandante Marcos, denied ever belonging to the
proscribed guerrilla movement.

Subject: Conscientious Objection
Date: 07 Jun 1996 11:34:08

Dear friends,

I would like, if it is possible, information on the laws of your country on 
conscientious objection to military service.  Those of you in the USA it would 
be helpful if you could provide me some stories on experiences of conscientious 
objectors in different states.

I am also interested in learning about any inter-religious dialogue that you 
may know in your country or conference related to this subject.

Thank you.

Subject:       Youth Delegation to Chiapas and Guatemala


CELEBRATE TWO HISTORIC 
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE'S STRUGGLES 
FOR  JUSTICE, DIGNITY & PEACE
                                       
JOIN THE YOUTH DELEGATION TO 
CHIAPAS, MEXICO & GUATEMALA
July 26-August 9, 1996
                                       
Though it has been over one hundred and fifty years since 
Mexico took the state of Chiapas by force from Guatemala, 
the indigneous peoples on both sides of the border remain linked
by their heritage and their current struggle for land, liberty
and democracy.

One of the most important contributions you can make to 
the indigenous struggles in Chiapas, Mexico and Guatemala is to 
learn first hand about the events in this region.  As a member of
the international community, your presence in indigneous
communities will send a strong statement to both
the Mexican and Guatemalan armies as well as private security
forces that the international community fully supports the
indigenous struggles for peace with justice and dignity and that
these communities are not hidden from the eyes of the world.

In Chiapas, the Youth Delegation will participate in the First
Intercontinental Gathering for Humanity and Against Neo-
Liberalism, an international social and economic conference
called by the Zapatista Army for National Liberation (EZLN).  The
conference will take place in the indigenous community of  La
Realidad in the Lacandon jungle of Chiapas. and will offer a
unique opportunity to participate in a historic exchange of ideas
and  knowledge with people from all over the world.  In addition,
delegates will learn first-hand about the struggle for peace,
justice and dignity and meet with human rights activists who have
been instrumental in mediating the peace talks between the EZLN
and the Mexican government. 

The Youth Delegation will also travel to the Guatemalan highlands
to meet with returning indigenous refugees who were displaced by
military oppression.  

This is a special opportunity to witness revolutions in progress
while providing support for grassroots struggles for peace with
justice and dignity.

                     CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT

                      JUSTICE IN CATACLYSM:
                        CRIMINAL TRIBUNALS
                              IN THE
                      WAKE OF MASS VIOLENCE

                   An International Conference,
                           sponsored by
                  DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW
                     in conjunction with the
                    OFFICE OF THE PROSECUTOR,
                      INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL
               FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA AND RWANDA


                        July 20 - 21, 1996
                        Brussels, Belgium

The Conference, "Justice in Cataclysm: Criminal Tribunals in the
Wake of Mass Violence," sponsored by Duke University School of Law in
conjunction with the Office of the Prosecutor of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, will bring
together leading thinkers to identify the most appropriate and
efficacious roles for national and international criminal justice
systems in responding to mass crimes in contexts of violent conflict.
 Such crimes include genocide, war crimes, and crimes against
humanity.

The timing of this Conference promises to maximize its benefits and
impact.  The International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia is presently conducting its first trial. Prosecutions by
the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda will commence
shortly. National-level criminal justice processes are currently
being prepared in Rwanda.  Trials of members of Ethiopia's Mengistu
regime for genocide and crimes against humanity are scheduled to
begin on April 4 of this year.

By July of 1996, prosecutions by these new national and
international criminal tribunals will have been underway for several
months, while the bulk of their work will still lie ahead.  The
summer of 1996 will therefore be the optimal time to convene.
Equipped with the insights already gained in several months of
experience, we will evaluate the successes achieved and the problems
encountered in these efforts, and will seek to develop valuable
approaches for the future course of these momentous judicial
proceedings.

                       Healing Circles of Life
                        SPECIAL  ANNOUNCEMENT
   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

   On Aug. 20, 1994 a white buffalo calf was born -- an astonishing and 
singular genetic event in the history of a native species (American 
Bison) that was nearly hunted to extinction the previous century.  The 
white buffalo calf was named "Miracle."

   For Native Americans, this birth is a sign from Spirit fulfilling 
ancient prophecy.  In legend it was White Buffalo Calf Woman who brought 
the Sacred Pipe and Path of Peace to Lakota (Sioux) peoples.  Birth of 
the white buffalo calf indicates events on Earth have entered an era of 
rapid change and transformation.  For one, the birth portends return of
of American Bison.  Read the words of Lakota Chief Arvol Looking Horse:

   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
                            Global  Healing
                     WORLD PEACE and PRAYER DAY
                            June 21st, 1996

   I, Arvol Looking Horse, 19th Generation Keeper of the White Buffalo 
Calf Sacred Pipe for the Lakota-Dakota-Nakota Nation, ask all Nations 
and Faiths on Mother Earth to declare June 21st, 1996 
                     WORLD PEACE and PRAYER DAY

   According to spiritual leaders and Elders who gathered at the United 
Nations -- and again at Six Nations, Canada -- "signs" of Indigenous 
people's prophesies have shown themselvesto tell us it's time to mend 
the Sacred Hoop: global healing by work for world peace and harmony.

   Birth of the White Buffalo Calf lets us know we're at a crossroads -- 
either return to balance or face global disaster.  It is our duty to 
return back to sacred places and pray for world peace.  If we do not 
do this, our children will suffer. 

   Before White Buffalo Calf Woman brought the Sacred Pipe to our 
ancestors, a Seer was traveling in the Sacred Black Hills  of Wyoming -- 
Pa Ha Sapa, "heart of everything that is."  At Grey Horn Butte (known 
as Devil's Tower), the Seer came on a large tipi.  Inside he saw the 
Sacred Pipe in the North and Sacred Bow and Arrow Bundle in the South.

   According to Star Knowledge, six stars designate six sacred sites in 
the Black Hills.  These are sacred places to pray.  We are told there 
is a sacred site every hundred miles around Mother Earth.  We ask all 
people to return to these places and pray from their hearts with us.

   It was decided according to Star Knowledge June 21st is the time to 
pray.  Indigenous people of Turtle Island will begin their spiritual 
journey on horseback from Wahpeton, Saskatchewan, Canada to Grey Horn 
Butte.  There, indigenous peoples will pray with the Sacred Bundle 
Keepers to begin restoration of peace and balance.

   We ask all Peoples to organize their ceremonies at their sacred sites 
in the manner they pray so they will pray at their sacred centers at 
the same time as we at ours.  The ceremony begins at 10 a.m. South 
Dakota (Mountain) time. 

   So far, we've spoken to leaders around the world and each has 
committed to support June 21st, 1996.  We ask all peoples of all 
nations and faiths to respond and support our efforts for world peace 
and harmony -- 

    -- our circle of life where there is no ending and no beginning -- 

                     May peace be with you all
                     Chief Arvol Looking Horse

                  BIRTH OF THE WHITE BUFFALO CALF

   David & Valerie Heider live south of Janesville, Wisconsin on Rock 
River.  Saturday morning, Aug. 20, 1994 one of their buffalos calved a 
female.  David's first concern was the calf's health.  He's seen many 
still-born calves and calves that live only hours or days.  On 
occasion he lost both calf and mother.

   "When the calf stood, I froze," said farmer Heider.  It had a pale, 
nearly white, coat.  The pale coat wasn't a great concern.  The 
Heiders were aware a white coat is rare in buffalo, but weren't aware 
many believe the strain had completely died out.

   Nor were they aware the significance a white buffalo has for Indian 
peoples.  They became aware when news of the white calf attracted 
attention of both media and Native Americans.  A tree decked with 
prayer ties, medicine wheels, sage & sweetgrass is silent witness that 
many Indian people come to pay respects., Phone calls from NY to 
Florida show great interest in the calf. 

   American Bison Federation wants blood samples to test if the calf is 
true buffalo or a cross with cattle.  Heider dismissed the tests; 
although he owns Longhorn and African cattle, the only bull on his 
land the past five years is Marvin, the bull buffalo that sired the 
white calf.  Ironically, Heider almost sold Marvin last year.

   The newborn is a first rare albino buffalo in 50 years.  Blood tests 
can't detect genetic traits that create albinos, so Heider must wait 
until the calf sheds its first coat in three months to be sure.  When 
buffalo covered the Great Plains, odds of an albino were 1 in 10 
million.  Experts thought the albinism gene was lost when buffalo were 
hunted to near-extinction in the late 1800s.

   Genetic testing isn't needed to determine if the calf is albino.  She 
is clearly not albino since she lacks red eyes and pink skin of an 
albino.  Her eyes are clearly the dark brown of buffalo. 
Mr. Heider said they have had numeous offers to buy the calf.  They 
aren't comfortable with her commercial exploitation and rule out 
selling her to a zoo, circus or similar commercial enterprise.  They'd 
sell her to Native Americans.

   The Heiders don't plan to keep her white shoulder coat when she sheds 
her birth coat this fall.  They can't handle large numbers of 
visitors; their narrow, winding road isn't safe to handle a lot of

Council volunteered round the clock security of the calf.

                               on
                     WORLD PEACE and PRAYER DAY
reprinted from Indian Country Today, Aug. 31, 1995

   In the January 1995 Lakota Times I published my presentation to the 
Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization where I stated:

   "In August 1994 a White Buffalo Female Calf was born.  This tells us 
it is time to take our rightful place leading the people toward peace 
and balance once again.  We will pray for the return of our holy land.  
We will pray for the two-legged, the four-legged, winged ones, and for 
Mother Earth."

   "We ask that you pray with us.  Indigenous Nations know our Mother 
Earth is suffering.  Humanity is heading toward total chaos and 
destruction."

   "That is both a scientific and spiritual fact."

   "As caretakers of Mother Earth, it's our responsibility to tell our 
brothers and sisters to seek Peace.  We ask every nation to declare 
June 21, 1996 World Peace and Prayer Day.  Pray at this time with us 
in your sacred areas."

   Since that time I have had resounding responses from both Indian 
leaders and spiritual leaders around the world.  In March 1995 I met 
with Liberal Member of Parliament Elijah Harper -- a high-profile leader 
who stopped Canadian Constitution legislation because it did not 
recognize Aboriginal rights.  He has committed to helping June 21 
become a legal holiday in Canada.

   Also, I met Chief Ovide Mercedi, who represents over 500 tribes 
in Canada.  Ovide is in full support of June 21 and is beginning the 
groundwork to gather elders and spiritual leaders this October to 
ensure that all tribes participate June 21, 1996.

   In May there was Summit VI: an international gathering of spiritual 
leaders at Six Nations, Canada, which focused on the prophecies of 
Indigenous people and what we are to do at this time as a people.
Cree from the north agreed to support this day with us, pray from 
their sacred site and host the June 21, 1997 World Peace and Prayer 
Day.

   Mayans from Chiapas, Mexico agreed to gather all their spiritual 
leaders at the Temple of the Sun to pray on this day with us and host 
World Peace and  Prayer Day June 21, 1998.  Mayans talked of the time 
when the white jaguar spirit is to be released.  Last January over 900 
medicine men gathered to write their prophecies on the wall of the 
Temple of the Sun.

   A man from Malaysian rainforest talked of diseases elders said are 
coming.  Tears of blood will stream from children's faces because they 
are uprooting trees that hold in the underworld.  He agreed to take 
this message to over 11,000 rainforest Indians to pray with us June 
21 from their sacred site.

   The Maori spoke of children suffering starvation as the world is going 
to shift and cleanse herself if we do not listen to the prophecies' 
instructions to return to our spiritual ways and use of the knowledge 
our ancestors left us.  They said they will pray from their sacred 
mountain, which is the first mountain to greet the rising sun.  I 
could go on and on, but you get the picture.

   I was asked at Summit VI to talk to Dakota, Nakota and Lakota chiefs 
and delegates of our traditional knowledge of the Pipe and prophecies.  
We have relatives as far north in Canada as Alberta.  We've forgotten 
about these people, and I'm working to help them reunite with southern 
relatives.

   I had a dream on the way to the Summit of a "ride" where my 
grandfathers came toward me in full headdress and buckskin through a 
cloud of dust.

   I felt like a young child.  I wanted my headdress -- the one placed on me 
when I was 12 years old, but I remembered mice had torn it.  Just then 
someone stuck a full headdress under my right arm.  In the dream I 
wanted to ride with my grandfathers -- a day I had waited for all my 
life.

   I told people at Summit VI I would lead a unity ride through Canada to 
reunite our relatives this coming July.  I believed the dream was of 
the upcoming ride in June from Canada to the Black Hills.
I traveled to Joseph Bighead, Saskatchewan to visit a traditional 
Cree, Chief Ernest Sundown, who wished to present me with a trailing 
headdress for my commitment to unity and mending the sacred hoop since 
1986.

   From there I traveled to Pheasant Rump, Saskatchewan -- a Dakota reserve 
-- and gave names to young men and  women.  The family presented me with a 
yearling horse.  We rode from Pheasant Rump to Wahpeton, Saskatchewan 
in three weeks.

   Elders greeted us from each community, sometimes with a Pipe.  Chiefs 
joined us, wearing their headdresses and carrying their staffs.  We 
would be led into a tipi to speak of prophecies and smoke the Pipe.

   Each nation honored us and committed to June 21, 1996.  Some said they 
never thought the message would come to them from their relatives in 
the south.  They never thought they would live to see this day.

   From Wahpeton I hurried to Green Grass where we organized a two day 
gathering  to talk about World Peace and Prayer Day with our own 
people, the World Council of Churches and members of peace 
organizations.

   From there I traveled to Pine Ridge, and again spoke of my whereabouts 
and push for World Peace and Prayer Day.

   During this time I also dreamt of Sun Dancing.  I had never had this 
dream before, and was told by elders when they made me Keeper of the 
Pipe and chief, "You do not have to Sun Dance because your whole life 
will be a sacrifice for the people.  The people take care of the 
Keeper, so you never work because you are the center and cultural 
carrier."

   My decision to Sun Dance is a commitment to pray for the people -- for 
things to change for the good, as they aren't good now and seem only 
to worsen.  My brother Ivan's vision was to go back to how Sun Dance 
was originally formed.  We honor his vision and commitment to 
strengthen the ceremonies in a good way.  It is the right time to Sun 
Dance.

   It is time for me to remind the people I have two titles - one as 
Keeper of the Sacred Pipe and one as chief.  To our knowledge no other 
Keeper was given two titles or burdens at such an early age.
This is a great responsibility at a time when the people are suffering 
all the effects of genocide and religious suppression.  Alcohol and 
abuse is the way of life we  see.

   I am trying to change that cycle of abuse we have toward one another.  
As Keeper and chief, I ask people to look at the big picture.  Look 
past your own personal situation and ask, "What have I volunteered for 
my people lately?"  And show respect for our ways and prophecies -- 
      -- our cycle of life where there is no ending and no beginning --

   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* 
   October 28, 1995

   Dear Friends,

   I make special effort to bring to your attention the statement of 
                         Arvol Looking Horse
   19th generation carrier of the White Buffalo Calf Woman pipe

   His is a call from the heartland of North America for a day of Global 
Healing at the heart and high-light of this summer.

   For me, Arvol's call came with astonishing synchronicity.

   Hiroshima Day 1992, I was in Wisconsin to research a story on hazards  
of electricity leaking from power lines, tour Wisconsin's many "Indian" 
mounds and visit an Oneida Indian near Green Bay.  While helping a poet 
and midwfe move their home, my left hand touched a 6,000 volt powerline.  
Scorched and unconscious, I slid off a sheet metal roof to fall 15 feet 
onto my upper back, fracturing several ribs and vertebrae, including 
shattering T-5.

   I didn't die, nor am I paralyzed, but in slow, painful recovery.  
Right hand fingers remain paralyzed; I type with three fingers on my 
left.  My left leg_senseless and motionless after my brush with death_
slowly grows strong and functional; on good days I walk to the corner 
with a walker and pedal an exercycle three miles.

   After three years of intense pain, disability and 
institutionalization, in 1995 I began to regenerate.  And to organize 
scattered, shattered fragments of my life.  Mid-October I opened a box 
of three years' accumulated letters.  Amid this I found a photo of the 
white buffalo calf (now named "Miracle") taken a few days after her 
birth Aug. 20, 1994 in Wisconsin_two years and a few miles from my 
hospital.  I taped this photo by my computer.

   Three days later, by email, I got Arvol's call for World Peace and 
Prayer Day.

      * as naturalist seeing weak, collapsing local & global ecosystems, 

      * as world citizen watching fragile efforts to end war & 
bloodshed, 

      * as friend of indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere, 

      * as geomancer studying sacred space & time on a living planet, 

      * as templar dream dismantle forts and rebuild earth temples, 

      * as spiritual man attentive to prophecy and Cycles of the Ages, 

   I immediately recognized the urgent truth of Arvol's call.  Decision 
Time has come: we must unite heart & mind in coherent prayer at Earth's 
holy  places.  Despite busy-ness, disabilities, pain, and poverty, I 
chose to distribute Arvol's call.

   Rummaging my files, I found old email from Robin Arnhold, who saw the 
white buffalo calf eight days after its birth.  I editted her firsthand 
report as Background to Arvol's message to make a simple poster.

   Next day I was taken to New York's Catskill Mountains where  Wallace 
Black Elk, Lakota medicine man, was conducting sweat lodges; I was 
invited for special healing.  As we left I finished a letter to National 
Public Radio on coverage of the United Nation's 50th Anniversary.

   I showed Wallace my poster.  He slowly, carefully read every word.  
And gave his approval.

   I read Wallace my letter to National Public Radio.  He approved.

   I told Wallace I returned from death's door on a mission.  Part is to 
found a new nation based on the best Natural & Hue-man Law (Ecology & 
Democracy) -- a Green Nation.  Wallace approved.

   I urge each and every all of you to: 

   *  mark June 21, 1996 on your calendars as a Day of Prayer for World 
Peace

   *  distribute Arvol's call to friends, neighbors, family, church, and 
other communities

   *  encourage publication and wide public distribution of Arvol's call

   *  urge religious and civic leaders to declare June 21, 1996 World 
Peace and Prayer Day and lead their communities in prayer services

   *  organize a ceremony at a sacred place to pray at Summer Solstice 
for healing of Earth, Nature and Hue-manity

   I'll mail, fax or email this poster, letter and related materials to  
anyone who sends me their address, fax no. or email address.  I live on 
$544/month SSI for my disability.  Donations are needed to keep my 
effort alive.

   for a green and peaceful planet,
   David Yarrow

Earth Day, April 22, 1996

Dear David,

   I was astonished when a sister in my Meditation Circle handed me your 
flyer on World Peace and Prayer Day, as I've been carrying the Great 
Pyramid Prophecy for Summer Solstice 1996 to people on the humble scale 
of my own publishing efforts.  See enclosed flyer and 4-page prophecy.

   I'd be grateful if you pass on copies of these to Arvol Looking Horse 
and those organizing activities around his mission.  I enclose cash for 
costs of copies and postage.

   I look forward to join in Solstice prayers from the mystic tradition 
of the Temple of the Great Initiation -- of which I've been initiate 
and teacher for over two decades -- with all people of all traditions -- 
especially our native brothers and sisters -- for healing of the Earth 
and transformation of consciousness in Unity and Universal Love.

   I'm very interested in further information about events unfolding 
around the tradition of the White Buffalo Calf mystery, and the meaning 
and how the prophecy and Star Knowledge are manifesting.

   Blessings upon your work, Mikiel

                 The Great Pyramid Prophecy
                              for
                     Summer Solstice 1996

   Let it be known to all, as given by the Great Pyramid, that 
we, as a global family, are "at the door of the House of God" 
as this summer approaches.  (God and Goddess are One.)

   Many prophecies confirm 1996 as a Year of Awakening from the sleep 
of ego -- the illusion of separateness as individuals and groups -- into 
One Consciousness in all -- Source of Universal Love.  Let peoples of 
all traditions join in prayer for planetary healing and peace at the 
Solstice "high Light" of this year.

   On the door of the Pyramid's inner sanctum (called "Secret House 
of God" in Egyptian scripture) is a rainbow-shaped sign displaying the 
"sacred cubit" -- divine standard of measure -- which we pass 
beneath (on the prophetic time-distance scale) this Solstice in 
preparation to begin passing through the Door by the end of July.  The 
Door spans to 2014 when the transition into the new Millennium (and the 
dimension of awareness of omnipresent divinity) will be complete.

                   Journey for Health and Peace 
                   by David Yarrow May 28, 1996 
 
Roy Steevenz was born in Indonesia of an indigenous Indonesian mother 
and Dutch father.  As a young man Roy joined the merchant marine and 
sailed the world.  His voyages eventually landed him in Los Angeles. 
 
There Roy became involved with Macrobiotics -- a way of life based on 
traditional Oriental philosophy, diet, culture, and spirit -- taught by 
Japanese adventurer and peace activist Georges Ohsawa, and his students 
in America, such as Herman & Cornelia Aihara in California, and Michio & 
Aveline Kushi in Boston.  Soon Roy became Director of the East West 
Center of Los Angeles, macrobiotic community center in the City of 
Angels.  In this role Roy oversaw a thriving center offering classes, 
books, foods, community dinners, healing services, and educational 
programs.  Roy was a Senior Teacher to counsel and guide people who 
sought relief from critical, often terminal illnesses.  Roy ran the LA 
Center nearly 18 years. 
 
Early in 1986, Roy met Yogesh Ghandi, grandson of Mahatma, who led 
India's nonviolent revolt against British colonial rule.  Turning point 
in Mahatma Ghandi's struggle with English imperialism was his Salt 
March, when he led thousands in a walk to the ocean to make salt to 
protest a British salt tax.  Yogesh, in the tradition of his ancestor, 
was on a Salt March -- a walk for world peace across America from Los 
Angeles to the United Nations in New York City. 
 
Roy left his family and LA EastWest Center to join this Salt March.  Roy 
distributed literature calling for a Macrobiotic Health and Peace Corps 
to teach healthy, wholistic, traditional living and healing.  The March 
visited the Hopi Indians who live in the Painted Desert of northeast 
Arizona in nine villages atop three mesas.  "Hopi" means "peace," and 
the Hopi claim to be the original inhabitants of North America, which 
they call Turtle Island.  One Hopi village -- Oraibi -- is the oldest 
continuously occupied settlement in North America.  Sadly, by the time 
the Salt March reached Denver, personalities and politics pulled it 
apart. 
 
But Roy persisted.  Where does a Salt March go in America?  The Salt 
City.  So, in summer 1986 Roy came to Syracuse, the Salt City, at the 
heart of New York, the Empire State.  There I ran Wellspring: The Center 
for Self Healing.  Roy spoke to our small macrobiotic community, then I 
took him to Onondaga Nation to meet a few clanmothers, chiefs and 
leaders in this ancient indigenous community.  Onondaga Nation is 
Firekeeper of the Grand Council of a Five Nation Confederacy founded by 
a legendary man remembered as Peacemaker.  For a few years I had kept my 
garden there. 
 
Afterward, Roy confided his personal vision to return to the Painted 
Desert to live with the Hopi people and encourage traditional culture 
and diet.  He felt the Hopi hold a key to the destiny of Humanity on 
Earth as we rapidly spiral into an end of a Century and Millennium.  He 
said both prophecy and star knowledge say world changing events will 
soon sweep our planet to challenge human consciousness, spirit and 
survival.  I agreed. 
 
Two years later I was in Charlottesville, Virginia working as Associate 
Editor of John Mann's SOLSTICE magazine. and writing my book Dragon and 
Ice Castle: Sacred Space in the Finger Lakes.  One day John handed me a 
package from Thomas Tarbet of Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Inside were four 
carefully written articles about the Hopi.  Since 1965 Thomas associated 
with Hopi traditionalists and prepared his essays under their guidance.  
One -- Tuuwaqatsi -- described Roy's return to the Hopi and his effort 
to heal Titus Qomayumptewa, a badly injured elder, and one of the best 
Hopi farmers. 
 
In 1990 I talked to Thomas Tarbet by phone about Roy's life with the 
Hopi.  Roy had become a controversy in the Hopi community, since he, 
with Titus, advocated abandoning white man foods and culture and return 
to traditional Hopi diet and way of life.  Younger Hopi resented this 
outsider who, through their elder, asked them to give up modern 
commercial culture's conveniences.  I could imagine Roy quietly 
reminding his detractors he himself was half indigenous bood.  Yet, 
insisted Thomas, "if Roy continues to play his cards well, traditional 
Hopi may take him underground with them when Purification Day comes."  I 
thought this a high compliment of Roy by the Hopi.  We all knew 
Purification seems now inevitable and immanent. 
 
In August 1992 Theresa Ghandi -- Yogesh's wife -- drove me from our home 
at Crystal Hill in Eden, NY to the Buffalo airport to fly to Minneapolis 
to teach a workshop -- Close the Food Circle: building sustainable 
regional food systems -- at the No. American Greens Economic Conference.  
The next day -- Hiroshima Day -- while visiting electrical engineer 
Spark in southwest Wisconsin, my left hand touched a 6,000 volt power 
line.  Scorched, shocked unconscious, I fell from a roof to break 
vertebrae and ribs.  I was in a Wisconsin hospital eight months. 
 
In 1994, in a Vermont hospital still recovering from my near-death 
encounter, I received electronic mail from Alpha Institute in Aurora, 
Colorado with an Affidavit drawn up by Thomas Tarbet on Roy's behalf.  
Titus had adopted Roy as a son.  Titus died and willed his land to Roy.  
Roy, with Titus' daughter, signed this legal document that Titus' land 
was sovereign under the Creator, not subject to rules of any human 
nation or government. 
 
Today humans face serious challenges of world peace, land preservation 
and ecosystem regeneration.  A few people committed their land and their 
lives to create Community Land Trusts: legal entities chartered to hold 
land in trust for future generations. European kings -- sovereigns who 
owned the land by Divine Right.  At Onondaga Peacemaker instructed the 
Grand Council chiefs and clanmothers to keep, caretake and guard land 
and its life for the Seventh Generation.  Traditional wisdom is we can 
own what is made by our hands and minds, but land -- made, not by 
humans, but Creator -- can't be owned. 
 
I tell this tale because Roy's act -- to declare land sovereign under 
Creator -- shines light down a path out of our current danger to a 
future bright with hope, love and life.  Roy's act is our next step on a 
path to realign Human Law with Divine Order. 
 
In April 1996, after writing this document, I saw the thread of Roy's 
story emerged in my life every two years.  Was it time for a new page in 
Roy's journey for health and peace?  I didn't doubt Roy's feet were 
still firmly on the path. 
 
Three weeks later Roy called from Arizona.  The next week his three 
essays arrived:  Global Moccasin Ceremony, The Tawa Message, and Global 
Liberation.  The first described how Titus fulfilled his destiny at the 
time of the birth of the white buffalo calf in Janesville, Wisconsin on 
Aug. 20, 1994 -- exactly two years and two weeks after my 6,000 volt 
catastrophe. 
 
Birth of the white buffalo calf held deep spiritual signifcance for the 
Lakota nations of the northern plains.  White Buffalo Calf Woman had 
brought the Sacred Pipe and instructions how to live in peace.  Lakota 
Chief Arvol Looking Horse, 19th generation carrier of the Sacred White 
Buffalo Calf Woman Pipe, had called for World Peace and Prayer Day on 
June 21, 1996.  I was already distributing copies of this message. 
 
Recognizing the timely, critical significance of Roy's call for Global 
Moccasin Ceremony to unite East and West, I immediately typed his 
message into my laptop to circulate via Internet and hard copy.  That 
Sunday, at a Christian fellowship service led by a healer from India, I 
took my first steps in 3 and a half years since Hiroshima Day 1992.  The 
next weekend friends took me to a Buddhist Peace Pagoda in Grafton, NY 
to celebrate Buddha's birthday and deliver the calls of Roy Steevenz and 
Arvol Looking Horse for unity and healing of Earth and Humanity at the 
Summer Solstice.

                      Tuuwaqatsi
     by Thomas F. Tarbet 1988 (all rights reserved)

When I first encountered traditional Hopi and listened to their 
history and prophecies, I felt as if I were witnessing the 
Crucifixion.  I beheld destruction of something divine and essential 
to our lives, with the knowledge I was helping finance this 
unspeakable crime with my taxes.  From then on I could not bear to 
hold a "regular" job, and gradually drifted into the service of the 
"black sheep" of Hotevilla -- outcasts even among other traditional 
Hopi.  Many of them had been imprisoned without trial by the United 
States government, essentially for practicing their religion.  I 
learned a Hopi priest was burned alive by a Catholic priest for the 
same reason three centuries earlier.  I met a man who ran from 
Oraibi to Winslow and back in a single day -- a total of 130 miles 
-- to telegraph the Government that its agents were stripping 
everyone naked and throwing them into insecticide to rid them of 
lice.  He sobbed like a baby when he told his story.

Yet these are the ones who say we must "keep a song in our hearts" 
through such trials on behalf of Creator's Path, or we will be 
defeated and the world destroyed.  Through my entire life, I never 
had such fun as when working with these "enemies of progress," 
traveling with them on speaking engagements and helping them 
communicate with the world, primarily by the prophesied means of 
"magic marks on cornhusk" -- free literature.

The effect has been amazing,  Without my asking, the written 
prophecies have been translated into German, Spanish and Japanese, 
still distributed free of charge.  With great pleasure, I watched 
steadily increasing interest in their message.  But from the time of 
my first encounter (1965) I have not seen a single sign of a genuine 
healing of damage done to the Hopi -- until recently.

In June 1988 I was visited by Roy Steevenz and Pat Davis.  Roy asked 
me to facilitate a meeting with traditional elders of Hotevilla 
concerning a spiritual mission to which he felt compelled.  He also 
had in mind possibly of finding Hopis who might take interest in the 
way of healing based on ancient Oriental knowledge of the Unifying 
Principle, since their teachings are so similar.  Roy and I made a 
trip to Hopiland late that summer.  During our visit, Roy found the 
keenest interest to be on the part of Titus Oomayumptewa, whose 
recent tragic experience made him especially receptive.

In his mid-eighties Titus had produced almost single-handedly one of 
the largest and healthiest fields of corn, until he was run over by 
a truck in 1987.  For months he was artificially kept alive in a 
hospital.  Carolyn Tawangyama -- a traditional grandmother who acts 
as a spiritual co-worker with Titus -- encouraged him to eat blue 
cornmeal, telling him "Don't leave us yet!  We still need you!"  She 
meant he was needed to help keep the escape route open for all 
humanity through the Day of Purification.

Carolyn describes herself as "only a messenger" in a fight to the 
finish between the Path of Everlasting Life and the world's largest 
superpower, and -- by extension -- the military-industrial rampage 
against ancient indigenous cultures globally, oblivious of their 
vital function as bloodlines of earth.  Her confidence unshakable, 
she simply says, "Truth can't be conquered."

As "father" of the katsinas -- the influential spirit beings 
personified each year in the ceremonial cycle of the village -- 
Titus plays a major role.  This year he leads the Niman ceremony, in 
which those katsinas return to their fall and winter home in the 
highest mountains in "Arizona" seventy miles to the southwest, 
temporarily called "San Francisco Peaks."

Titus recovered, but could hardly walk, hear or speak.  Most days 
were spent sitting alone in an empty house, dreaming of his great 
fields of happier years, while his family was away at paid jobs or 
school.  Seeing his condition, and wishing to communicate with him, 
Roy had little choice but to demonstrate the healing he came to talk 
about.  Soon Titus began to welcome Roy's visits, taking great 
interest in what he had to say about healing, and the role of food 
in the cycle of life.  After changes in his "white man's food" diet 
and a week of daily massages, Titus began a remarkable recovery.

Roy replaced the heavy cane Titus depended on, making him a lighter 
one, sort of a spirit staff, meant to be abandoned soon, and soon it 
was.  Within a few months Titus was able to walk freely.  Now he is 
actually able to work in his fields again.  He kicks and punches the 
air and says "Look!  I can fight!"  His white hair is starting to 
grow in black.  He even thinks of composing a song about his 
experience.  And now when he sits alone he ponders the fact his 
people never got sick before eating "white man's food."  Why it has 
taken a century for any Hopi to notice the connection is one of 
life's mysteries.

Prior to recent forced acculturation, the Hopi had a completely 
macrobiotic culture.  Corn is still their sacrament, given them by 
Creator to sustain them on their migrations when they first entered 
this world.  Until very recently it was their primary food, along 
with squash, beans, and a variety of wild and cultivated vegetables, 
occasional meat hunted with bow or stick, and salt dug from the 
earth or brought from the Pacific coast in a ceremonial run no 
longer made today.

Titus himself has long declared "corn has everlasting life."  He 
also says Hopi were taught if they lived from what grows nearby they 
would stay healthy.  In the past their only illnesses came from 
losing the connection with the spirit.  "Miraculous" healings 
occurred as the lost connection was restored in thought and 
attitude.  But today persistent illness is common.  Despite their 
own teachings, only around 10 percent of Hopi still farm.  Even 
Titus simply ate what came his way from his wage-earning offspring.  
Past attempts to rescue the Hopi from the effects of "white man's 
food" have ironically been rejected as outside interference.  But 
Titus now tells others about his experience, and his enthusiasm has 
spread to a small number of villagers who might not otherwise have 
listened to a stranger.  This response is completely unprecedented.

For Hopi, the Path of Everlasting Life springs from their fields and 
gardens.  Its restoration is a simple human act.  If, as they say, 
"the teachings are in the corn," the true Hopi Way can be recovered 
by restoring corn.  Carolyn says there is enough left of the 
vanishing ceremonial order for it to be revived, but this will not 
happen if their indigenous foods are neglected.  It took tremendous 
misguided effort from outside Hopi culture to induce this neglect.  
One percent of that effort -- guided wisely -- could swing the 
balance once again toward the Path of Everlasting Life.  But it will 
take persistence, as with the effort required to produce a tiny 
ember with a fire drill.  Like that ember, if carefully nurtured, 
its effect could be very great.  Otherwise it will die out.

In order to nurture this new fire, Roy and Pat have established a 
project they call Tuuwaqatsi.  Roy and I learned this Hopi word 
during our visit.  In the course of his conversation with the 
Hotevilla elders, I listened carefully as something about "peace" 
was being translated into Hopi, for they actually have no word for 
peace.  We think the word was tuuwaqatsi ("q" is a deep "k").  The 
first thing Titus thinks of when he hears that word is "praying all 
the time."  As we were leaving Hopiland, we met a noted expert on 
the Hopi language, who explained the roots of the word are "sand" 
and "life."  Since Hopi soil is mainly sand, tuuwa refers to all 
land, bringing forth qatsi, the life upon it, which the lives and 
prayers of all true Hopi, and all true humans, endlessly promote.

                     (June 20 in the U.S.A.)
                    prepared by Roy Steevenz

[Editor's Preface:  May 14,1996 three essays arrived from Roy Steevenz, 
who has lived with Hopi Indians in northeast Arizona's Painted Desert for 
nearly a decade, caring for Titus, a traditional elder and farmer in the village 
Hotevilla.  I quickly realized the timely significance and urgency of Roy's 
messages, so I set them to digital format.]

[I have five earlier essays about Roy, Titus and the Hopi (Journey for Health 
& Peace; Tuuwaqaatsi; Affidavit of Sovereignty Under Creator's Law; and 
Restoring the Roots of Peace; Gourd of Ashes/House of Mica).  These 
documents, each about one page, provide background crucial to understand 
this story and ceremony.  Access these documents at:]

[Global Moccasin Ceremony is synchronous with World Peace and Prayer 
Day called by Lakota Chief Arvol Looking Horse, 19th generation keeper of 
the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Woman Pipe.  All over Earth humans are 
preparing to gather June 21_solstice high-light of the year_at sacred sites
to pray for Peace: healing and unity of our planet at this "turning point."]

[Roy's story reveals how tightly woven are the threads of human destiny on 
Earth at this time.  Birth of the white buffalo calf was not mere remarkable
genetic coincidence, but expresses the synchronous unity of Spirit and 
Destiny weaving a warning we now have entered a crucial time.  The time of 
choice and change is now.  Roy's vision offers medicine to unify minds, 
cultures, continents, and spirits of our planet.  Join us to unite together 
in prayer at the solstice.                           -- david yarrow]

                 THE DESTINY OF TITUS QOMAYUMPTEWA

The great wish of Titus Qomayumptewa, a Hopi elder, was like so many who 
wish to live freely free and happy -- that anyone who truly wants to be 
a servant of the Creator of All -- God -- attain Individual Sovereignty 
under His law. 

"Shake the anthill (world).  Tell the world the truth about Creator's 
Law," he often said. 

This Global Moccasin Ceremony is inspired by this simple Hopi farmer.  
As we look about our 'anthill,' how can we deny the need to fulfill this 
honest desire? 

Titus -- one of the Jewels of the few remaining Hopis -- had a most 
important spiritual destiny.  At the time of the lunar eclipse on May 
24, 1994, Great Spirit visited Titus In his cabin.  While the sun was 
setting, the cabin became filled with sparkling lights.  The little 
stars finally settled around his head.  On that evening a profound 
message came through: 



"THE TIME IS UPON US NOW to come forth and give our knowledge to 
those 
willing to help the energies of the Creator. 

"The path has been constructed of many different energies and elements 
were placed together lovingly and with much hardship at the time.  We 
transformed our nation many times because we were learning about our new 
home.  We had to change with Earth as she guided us in our lifestyles 
and foods.  We gave ourselves to Creator, who gave back with abundance. 

"The path now is one of change.  We are here in strength to help make 
that change smooth and peaceful, and assure its energies are pure, and 
its meanings are true.  There have been -- and will be again -- great 
times of despair at the loss of culture, as those who resist change 
fight to hold on. 

"THE HOPI WAY WILL NEVER VANISH.  It may undergo change now and 
then, 
which is important, but the Hopi Way remains in the land, rocks, trees, 
animals, and all features of true creation.  They all tell the story of 
the Hopi. 

"It is not limited to the Hopis either.  The chance to change is 
everywhere now.  Many avenues of discovery lead to the same conclusion.  
You will need to bridge the gap between worlds and cultures to listen to 
us.  We are ever strong, waiting to guide you. 

"The Hopi culture as it was is gone, but there are many wonderful things 
that can be created from that.  Listen to the wind for direction.  Ask 
the fields for assistance.  Feel the beating of the Hopi heart in 
everything you do, everything you feel, everything you touch, everything 
you say.  You can have the magic we once shared.  It is still there and 
always will be. 

"Be peaceful and trusting in your endeavors.  We fought for many years 
to have peace for our people.  We presented ourselves to many who are 
able to maintain, and carry forth into the lives of people, the peace we 
fought for.  The history of our civilization is written in Earth, and 
anyone who gives themselves to Creator can use this knowledge for Earth 
and her evolution. 

"We commend and comfort those who are powerful in their work to reunite, 
and we support and guide those wanting to make peaceful changes.  There 
are several in your community who are holders of the knowledge.  They 
are able to bring forth the message you strive for.  They will surface 
at the right time. 

"Be not afraid of the future outcome.  Focus only on what can be 
achieved right now.  Fighting between nations will need to stop before 
order can be restored. 

"The beginning of the next phase will come in three cycles of the moon.  
You will have new direction, new focus and new guidance.  Be at peace 
with yourself and listen to our calling.  The course is changing and the 
path is widening.  There is much global concern for the return to 
purity, and the time is upon us to help activate the energy that can 
bring this return. 

"You will see changes in the community, the people you meet, and in the 
children.  They may be confused at times as to why they feel a certain 
way, and want to know their history.  Let them experience this, for they 
will be the ones who help bring forth the new Hopi light. 

"Be patient, but be strong.  Guide and assist those who chose to help. 

"KNOW WE ARE WITH YOU."



Exactly three moon cycles later, a man in Maine had a serious dream.  In 
the vision he went to the underworld and heard an old man singing a most 
sacred, ancient song.  Halfway through singing it, the old man suddenly 
stopped, but Rusty (the dreamer) heard the rest of the song.  When he 
woke up he felt a strong desire to find the old man and give him the 
last part of the song.  He wondered who the old man was.  How would he 
find him?  Does he even exist?

Rusty consulted with a seer and was told to find Titus in Hopiland.  
Without hesitation he made the drive west, and was guided straight to 
Titus' farm.  Upon arriving, Rusty conveyed his dream to Titus and 
delivered the rest of the song. 

Titus smiled and nodded happily.  Indeed, four years earlier, at a 
Hotevilla meeting full of conflict between "progressives" and 
"traditionals,"  Titus, at the beginning of the meeting, began to sing.  
All Hopis present became panicked and urged Titus to stop singing.  It 
was the long-awaited Purification Song that calls on Higher Forces, and 
is meant to be sung only once.  "Stop singing Titus!  It is not time 
yet.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop!"  But he didn't heed, and kept on until he was 
halfway through the song.  Suddenly he stopped. 

On August 22, 1994, at the full moon, the Purification Song became 
complete.  At almost the same time the long-prophesied White Buffalo was 
born! 

                 STORY OF WHITE BUFFALO CALF WOMAN 

The medicine man Crow Dog, of the Lakota tribe, explains: 

"This holy woman brought the sacred buffalo calf pipe to the Lakota.  
Before she came, people didn't know how to live.  They knew nothing.  
The White Buffalo Woman put her sacred mind into their minds. 

"Though she first appeared to the Lakota in human form, White Buffalo 
Woman was also a Buffalo -- the native people's brother, who gave its 
flesh so that the people might live. 

"White Buffalo Woman spoke these words to Lakota Chief Standing Hollow 
Horn:  'Remember this pipe is very sacred.  Respect it and it will take 
you to the end of the road.  The four ages of creation are in me; I am 
the four ages.  I will come to you in every generation cycle.  I shall 
come back to you.' 

"The White Buffalo Woman walked off in the direction from which she 
came, outlined against the red ball of the setting sun.  As she went, 
she stopped and rolled over four times.  The first time she turned into 
a black buffalo; the second into a brown one; the third into a red one.  
Finally, the fourth time she rolled over, she turned into a white female 
buffalo calf. 

"WHITE BUFFALO CALF WOMAN IS THE RETURN OF PEACE -- OF ALL 
FOUR RACES 
COMING TOGETHER -- TO MEND THE SACRED HOOP -- ENDING 
SEPARATION AND 
POLARIZATION.  SHE IS THE RAINBOW MANIFEST..." 

                       THE LEGACY OF TITUS 

Titus fulfilled his destiny and passed on one month later -- Sept. 28, 
1994, the birthday of Grandmother Caroline, Titus' very close clan 
sister.  The next day a river of cotton clouds came from the direction 
of the sacred San Francisco Peaks to stream light over Titus' grave, 
moving to the East.  At the same time, with the rising sun, a small 
cloud rose over the horizon and joined the oncoming clouds. 

The fourth day after Titus' departure to the spirit world, Rusty had a 
Stone Lodge Ceremony at his home in Maine.  He didn't know yet of Titus' 
passing, but he noticed something very strange and powerful happen 
during the ceremony.  The gourd rattle given him by Titus suddenly moved 
over the hot stones and kept rattling -- and not by any physical hand.  
It rattled until the contents broke out. 

The next day after the lodge was dismantled, three waves of seven hawks 
each flew over the lodge in the southwest direction! 

Later, a special four-day ceremony was held at Titus' cabin.  It was 
decided to use his moccasins in an East/West Union Ceremony.  One 
moccasin was to be placed at Mt. Fuji, Japan.  The day of the prophesied 
Atlantic/Pacific Cross America Walk, confirmation was given the moccasin 
found its destiny on Mt. Fuji. 

Now connection of "extreme West" and "extreme East" must be advanced.  
Global participation in this is of great importance. 

East relates to the ancient past; West relates to the present modern 
world.  Now is the time to end the great experiment that encompassed 
these two worlds.  And the RETURN must be undertaken.  This means the 
East/West Union is of cardinal importance.  It is bringing together all 
that has been learned throughout history up to this time from both 
"extremes." 

Titus' encouragement to "tell the truth about Creator's Law to the 
world" held a simple -- but most essential -- message for peace and 
freedom.  Deviation from the Self-Enforcing Law of the Creator has led 
to creation of artificial laws.  These ultimately have to be enforced 
with violence.  All wars, inner and outer, can end only by RETURN to the 
One Law.  All terrorism is the result of one's obedience to secondary 
inferior authority.  Today's destructive wars reflect competition 
between parties who each insist their laws are superior.  This arrogance 
has led to massive slaughter and great unhappiness. 

The world is come to the concluding moments of this prophetic scenario.  
Each one of us must now make The Choice.  Which authority do we want to 
honor first?  We cannot serve two masters.  We all know the Creator of 
All is Highest.  Only our blindness caused by the glitter of temporary 
security and pleasures make us falter and sheepishly follow false 
leaders. 

Now we have Democracy, so each one of us must individually and 
independently decide which master we will serve.  The Creator of All 
gave us ultimate authority to make choices based on Free Will.  Will we 
continue to defend the "Common Boundaries" set by mine/yours laws?  As 
long as we support this dualism, we will torture and destroy ourselves.  
Or will we choose to have the courage to stand as true individuals, 
sovereign  under Creator's Law?  This should not be too much to ask of 
ourselves if we want to know the truth of who we are. 

TRUTH WILL SET US FREE. 

                 GUIDELINES FOR PARTICIPATION 

If you wish to participate in the Global Moccasin Ceremony on June 20, 
1996 in the U.S., and June 21 in Japan, the following is a suggested 
format.  For synchronized local times in different parts of the world, a 
Global Timetable is at the end. 

*  Anyone can initiate a ceremony. 

*  As the Rising Sun touches the west side of Mt. Fuji, all who 
participate will simultaneously be upon their highest point to perform 
the ceremony.  Sunrise following Summer Solstice in Japan will be 5:00AM 
on June 21, while at San Francisco Peaks in Arizona the time will be 
1:00PM Mountain Standard Time June 20 (Arizona doesn't participate in 
Daylight Savings Time).  Don't let International Dateline confuse you! 

*  It is suggested those not able to participate in ceremony at these 
high points may deposit their prayer in a One Heart Container to later 
be buried at the ceremonial site.  A One Heart Container can be made 
following a simple design.  Write for this plan. 

*  Natural foods of local traditional origin (without chemicals, 
electric or microwave cooking) can be used as an offering at the site.  
Also, spring, well or untreated water can be used. 

*  As the pilgrims ascend to the site, the long path of human existence 
on Planet Earth is to be visualized.  Upon arrival, begin to see East 
and West blend into ONE. 

*  The ceremony begins with recitation or singing of the following for 
eleven minutes: 

Wake up!  Wake up!  Wake up! 
Rise with the Rising Sun! 
Listen to the Heart! 
We are one!  We are One!  We are One! 

*  Continue the ceremony for a full hour with prayer, song, dance, 
offering of food, as is most appropriate for your location.  Hold the 
central idea of Union of East and West. 

*  This ceremony is only a beginning.  Continue sharing this message of 
UNION.  The TAWA Messenger Newsletter may be used to distribute the 
information. 

*  Send this information world-wide through word-of-mouth, copies, 
email, Internet, or your local grapevine.  Translation to other 
languages is welcome.  On the Internet, you will find information on 
ceremonial sites by accessing Global Moccasin Ceremony. 

Thank you!

Jury Selection Begins in Gustafsen Lake 'Standoff' Trial.

The long process of picking jurors for the trial of the
Sundancers involved in the Gustafsen Lake 'standoff' begins
Saturday, June 1 and continues for six days a week until the
whole jury is chosen.  Both the Defense and the Crown have
extensive rights to question and dismiss jurors they find
questionable.  One of the main concerns is in finding people
who have not been prejudiced by the inaccurate and slanted
media coverage that took place during the 'standoff.'
Because the media coverage was extensive and demonized the
Defenders, it is a real concern that jurors be questioned
closely about their attitudes.  The types of questions
permitted and the areas they addressed are now under a press
ban to keep potential jurors from considering their answers
before they are questioned by the jurors.  It has been hoped
that at least 20% of  the jurors would be aboriginal people
but this is proving a difficult objective as their are few
aboriginal people living in Surrey.  It may be necessary to
search for jurors outside of  the Surrey area.

Many of the Defenders have been in the Penatang (? I'm not
sure of the spelling) gathering strength in ceremonies and
sweats.  As well, everyone has been helping William Jones
Ignace's (Jonsey) wife Flo on the farm by planting seeds.
Jonesy is still in jail charged with attempted murder but
his spirits remain high.  He has, in conjunction with Harold
Pascal, Glen Deneault and Bruce Clark just finished a court
action requiring Attorney General Dosanjh to prove
jurisdiction.  The Judge denied the argument but two
Defenders - Shelagh Franklin and Glen Deneault plan to use
the jurisdiction argument as their defense.  Both will be
representing themselves but will be able to get advice from
the four Defense lawyers as well as Dr. Bruce Clark.

The Defense lawyers are: George Wool, an ex-RCMP officer who
was in the force for 20 years; Sheldon Tate who is very
precise and thorough, Don Campbell who is a good original
thinker and Harry Rankin who when he was in the Vancouver
City Council for many years always fought tirelessly for the
less powerful.  Lawyer George Wool and his wife participated
in the ceremonies this past week and like the other lawyers,
understands and supports the Defenders and their goals.

The RCMP disclosures not only contradict their press
releases but also indicate that there is not much evidence
to support their charges against the Defenders.  It is hoped
that the press ban will be lifted once the jury is chosen
and the public will get a chance to learn the truth which is
quite different from the media construction architected by
the RCMP.

The Defenders are still looking for accomodation in Surrey.
There are several possibilities and fortunately there is
money for the rent.  They prefer to stay together to make it
easier to hold ceremonies and to arrange transportation to
the trial.

Spirits remain high as the Defenders look forward to the
truth coming out.   I am hoping that various Defenders will
write something for this list when they are in town.

The trial is expected to begin in mid June.

Subject: sisters in Prison for Women: Wanda'
Date: 30 May 1996 23:01:17

In April 1994 some violence, involving 6 women inmates and some of the
staff happened at the Prison for Women (P4W) in Kingston, Ontario, Canada,
which Canadian readers of this at least will be familiar with. They were
far from the only violent events to ever occur there, but the strip search
of 8 women inmates by a male enforcement squad, subsequent body cavity
search, and holding of the women in segregation for up to nine months, with
use of shackles, were enough to draw public attention and ultimately an
investigatory commission, whose report came out in April of this year.

In her report Commissioner Louise Arbour called P4W "... an old fashioned,
dysfunctional labyrinth of claustrophobic and inadequate spaces ...
inadequate for living, working, eating, programming, recreation, and
administration." Part of the results of that inadequacy, at the prison and
in the criminal system generally, were the suicides of several women, most
of them Native.

On March 14 Councillor Wanda Whitebird spoke at First Nations House in
Toronto, Canada on the subject of those events, the suicides, and the
conditions that led to them. A notice was posted to this list at the time
advertising the fact, under the subject heading "Send greetings to sisters
in prison," with a promise to upload the transcript of her talk shortly
thereafter. The following is that transcript. Apologies for the delay;
Wanda has been very busy and it's taken this long to get her approval of
the text.

                                  +++++++
When I was asked to come here, they asked if I could speak on behalf of the
sisterhood. I don't think anybody could talk on behalf of the sisterhood
except the sisterhood, but what I can do is carry a message from them. As
Aboriginal people, we've been silenced for a very long time, and never
allowed to speak, so I would not want to take away the voice of those women
and replace it with my own.

I have not spent any time in prison [as an inmate; Wanda worked as a
councillor at Prison for Women for three years], although I have very close
friends who have been in prison, and died in prison.

I was asked yesterday if I was surprised at the incident that happened two
years ago in P4W. No, I wasn't surprised, that wasn't the first time that's
happened, and its certainly not going to be the last time.

My work at Prison for Women -  while I was there, four women committed
suicide.  There were six all together. And because I was aboriginal
councillor, I was the one who notified their families. Those people who die
in prison have families; they have mothers and brothers and sisters and
aunts. Our society likes to lock away the ugliness and those marginal
people, rather than take responsibility for them. And so we blame the
vicims for their own victimization.

The first one - I wasn't working there yet - was Sandy Sayres. She was a
beautiful young women who was doing time on a provincial sentence, which
meant whe shouldn't even have been there. She was sentenced to two years
less a day, but they figured they couldn't handle her in Saskatchewan, so
they sent her to P4W. She was 26 when she got there. She never left. That
was Oct. 1.

In February I was in Kingston at a liaison conference. There was another
woman there by the name of Marie Ladew, who committed suicide in what we
call the Little House, a house inside the prison. Her dad was visiting her
inside the little house, and it was her father that found her, hanging in
the basement. She was soon to be released, I think she had five months
left.

I went to work there in May. On Sept. 15, a young woman also from
Saskatchewan, also Native but adopted to a non-Native family, she was
serving a five-year sentence for manslaughter, I think. She had been abused
all her life. I spoke with her adoptive mom on a Friday. We were planning
her discharge, because she was going back to Vancouver. On Saturday night I
got a phone call that she had committed suicide. The toughest thing was to
phone her mom, because I had made a promise that I would keep Corinne safe.

In November 15 another woman attempted suicide. Her name was Johnny. Her
attempt was a little unsuccessful, she put herself in a coma and it was two
years before she died. So P4W consider that she didn't die in prison, and
she's not a statistic.

The fifth woman - actually she was the first, but because she didn't die in
prison she isn't part of the official statistics - was a woman who died on
the street. Her name was Pat Bear. She was released from prison into
Kingston. She wasn't from there. And because she was on what they call
warrant expiry, which means she no longer had a sentence and she was no
longer a responsibility of Correctional Services of Canada. Because she
wasn't a resident of Kingston, she wasn't a Kingston responsibility either.

Patty phoned where I was working in Toronto, and said she wanted to go
home. We were looking for money to send her home to her reserve. That night
in the park in Kingston she hung herself with her shoelaces in a tree, and
the next day her mom phoned to say they had the money to bring her home.

The last one - in December of that same year, I took Lorna home to British
Columbia, to a funeral of her brother's who'd hung himself in a prison in
BC. February 4 of the following year, Lorna committed suicide in P4W.

Lorna died on the 4th of February, and the riot happened on the 6th of
February [1994], and there was a lockdown. I don't blame them for losing
it, if there were so many suicides.

Just recently, there's been another suicide at P4W, this one a non-Native
woman. She died 3 weeks ago. Nothing's been made of it. This woman hung
herself in what's called the Wing Area, and this is supposed to be a
minimum security, happy place. And this is supposed to be a happy time for
the women, because the prison is closing and now we have five prisons
across Canada to send them to, and now they're going to be closer to home.

Well, your home base is not where you're from. Your home base is where you
were convicted of the crime. So if you were convicted in BC then you're
considered a BC inmate. You could be from Nova Scotia. So they're going to
send the women back to the jurisdictions where they committed their crimes.
Yeah, some of them committed their crimes at home. And how many people want
convicted murderers back in their communities? They don't. So they've made
homes here. They don't want to go home.

It doesn't solve the problem to build new prisons.

They've opened up a place they call the Native Healing Lodge in Maple
Creek, Saskatchewan. Our vision - the women's vision - for a healing lodge
was not a prison. It was a place that the women could go to heal, to be
real.

Correctional Services Canada [CSC] told us that all the Native women who
wanted to could go there. The reality is, they have to be minimum security
to go to this prison. And if you look at statistics, there's not an
Aboriginal woman in Canada who has a minimum security status. One of the
reasons they're not minimum security is they had to fight for their
feathers, for their drums. So because they're very radical, and they stand
up for what they believe in, and they're warriors, they don't conform.
There are some who have gained medium security, and I think two of them are
in the 'Native Healing Lodge' - until recently they didn't take any from
P4W.

The 'Native Healing Lodge' has a warden, but they're to call her Mother.

In my culture a mother is someone who is loving and healing and caring. I'm
not going to call any prison warden Mother.

And they're to call the guards Auntie. And if they don't call the guards
Auntie, they get charged.

And so because they reject that concept, they aren't healed enough to go.


They've shaken up Prison for Women, and all the people who worked there
when I was there are gone. I went anywhere in that prison. I don't think
there's anyone who had the security clearance I did. Can't do it now,
because the people who allowed those things to happen, because they cared,
are gone. They would override the guards on certain issues. Security hated
me. In other prisons, they control the prison, and if they don't like me,
then I can't get in.

The riot that happened April 22 happened during a sweat lodge ceremony. And
I'll say for the warden who was there, she had enough respect for us - I
mean here's the riot going on, you can hear the riot squad coming in and
screaming, and the sweat went ahead. Because we had already put the rocks
on, and once you put those rocks on, it means somebody has to use them. You
can't just tell them you're going to go away now. I don't think there was a
prison in Canada that would have allowed that sweat to go through. But that
warden had enough courage to stand up to Security - I was standing there.
They said no, she said yes. They said no, she said who runs this prison? So
the sweat went ahead. So as the women were being dragged out by the goon
squad the sweat was going on at the other end of the prison.

They have a new warden there now, one who will toe the line, as far as I'm
concerned. I don't have any love for wardens at all, but for the warden who
was there I do have, because we were able to accomplish a lot. Because she
had a lot of respect, and the guts to fight the system. And she takes the
heat for what happened at that prison, because she's a scapegoat, as far as
I'm concerned.

[the CBC staffer who listened to this tape agreed that they'd heard
unpleasant things about the new warden at P4W - Steve]

I guess I want to remember those women, so that their lives were not lost
in vain. They've had several inquests into those suicides, and some
recommendations. Not a lot on how they're going to implement those
recommendations. But it came out that Lorna's suicide wasn't a suicide.
Sandy confessed to killing her. She's now serving a life sentence in Prince
Albert, Saskatchewan. They don't know what to do with her. She's a very
angry woman. I've never understood a sister taking another sister's life.
But prison breed sickness, and that's what they did to Sandy.

So we've lost not just six, but a seventh, because that woman now carries a
life sentence. She came from Saskatchewan, doing something like four years,
twenty years ago now. And in that time it's now a life sentence. She's
never walked out of prison.

The majority of women sentenced at P4W are not sentenced to long sentences.
But they get lots of sentences while they're there. Sandy also took a
hostage, and so she got eight years for that. And most of the women come
there doing three, four years and they end up doing life. A sick system
breeds sickness.

As one of the First Nations directly affected by the actions of those who
favor or those who oppose any form of logging in British Columbia, and more
specifically Clayoquot Sound, it astounds us that people can be convinced to
support a cause without first communicating with our First Nations for our
perspectives.

This form of action is only indicatative of the shortsightedness on groups
parts to not communicate properly with those directly affected by the
actions such as a full page Ad.  Was there any consideration or explanation
given by those groups to the stars about the implications of their actions?

Secondly, the political motivations that guided the timing of this Ad need
further scrutiny.  Had any of the stars or the groups who convinced the
stars to support such an Ad considered the "negative" implications that a
change of government would have not only of First Nations but also on the
environment?  We think not because if they had given serious thought to
this, they would have communicated with the First Nations to weigh both the
pros and cons of utilizing this form of protest and timing it with an
election.  One can't help but speculate that this form of action only
enhances the possibility that the governing party will be removed and an
even more unfriendlier government will take power.

As First Nations, we constantly are struggling with the worst of both evils,
and despite the haphazard manner in which the existing government has
brought about significant changes in Clayoquot Sound, we see that a change
of power would only jeopardize those changes that both the environment
community and First Nations aspire to achieve.  Granted, in some circles the
changes are not enough and it may be that whatever changes are put forward,
they will never be enough (except for a complete shut down of all logging
operations).  From our First Nations perspectives, we've seen and
experienced a significant change in the attitude of government and we get
concerned that groups would develop a political strategy that could
potentially bring about a change of government that would be even less
friendly to the environment cause.  Is that the political motivation to the
purchasing of an Ad?

It may not have been but that strongly looks to be the political implication
of such a strategy adopted by the groups who convinced the stars to sign on.
Is it the political motivation of the groups to see the treaty making
process completed stalled?  That is the political fall out of a change of
government and Ads put forward with the timing of an election in mind can do
nothing but further enhance the chances of the political Opposition party to
take power.

What an impressive list!!!!!!  A credit must go to Bobby Kennedy Jr. for at
least having the common courteousy to first consult with the First Nations
before taking any real direct actions.  That worked to his benefit as we now
view ourselves as having a strong relationship built from the basis of trust,
understanding and committment to work together.  It would be great to meet
all of these wonderful stars to share our views and perspectives, but as
First Nations directly affected by the actions of the groups who convinced
the stars to sign onto the Ad, we know that this will never take place given
that they have their Agenda and it appears that our perspectives just don't
meet their Agenda!!!!!!

First off, as the groups who convinced the stars to sign onto the Ad fully
know and realize, there is a difference between government adopting a
report and actually implementing a report.  Unfortunately in many cases we
all are frustrated with how reports are not being implemented!   In the
above, it is stated "As of last year, logging in Clayoquot Sound is supposed
to adhere to recommendations by a B.C. government-appointed science panel,
including the reductions in the size of clearcuts."  Last year was the
government's announcement to adopt the Science Panel's report.  This was a
fundamental step by government given that all the various groups within the
environment were threatening the government with newly initiated boycotts if
the government did not adopt the report.

The reference to what was to apply as of last year is out of context in that
surely people must realize that there had to be an implementation plan and
strategy in place to give effect to those recommendations made by the
Science Panel and surely it was not the expectation of those groups that the
day government adopted the recommendations was the day that they would also
be expected to be implemented!  If that was the groups' expectations, then
unfortunately they were misguided in their thinking as it was made clear in
the governments' announcement that it would take time to implement.  They
have now developed an implementation strategy to give effect to the 127
recommendations and as First Nations we knew this process was painstakingly
long - but it was never our understanding that the recommendations would be
law the day they were adopted.

Given this, that's why it astounds us that the groups who convinced the
stars to sign onto the Ad are willing to take a political gamble by timing
the Ad with the elections.  Is it not their view that we face a strong
possibility that our government will change and that the Science Panel
requirements will never be declared law if an unfriendlier government takes
power?  That is the political implication of fighting the existing
government on the changes they've brought to how business is done,
particularly in Clayoquot Sound.  This strategy plays right into the hands
of the Liberals who espouse protecting the interest of big business
corporations like M&B!

[ That's Macmillan-Bloedel, a gigantic logging and paper-products industry
  in the province of British Columbia.  --Gary ]

As First Nations directly affected, our strategy is not to take this
government out of power but it is geared towards working with government to
give effect to those changes that they have brought to Clayoquot Sound.  Our
position all along has been that we do not oppose logging in general, but we
certainly want a direct say in changing how the big logging companies
conduct business in our territories and that includes changing the forest
practises.  Our view is that by purchasing Ads that could influence the
provincial elections that could potentially put into power a more
unfriendly party will only hurt the cause of not just the environment
community but even moreso the aspirations of those First Nations.  It is
that perspective that we ask the stars to consider.  It is unfortunate
that those groups that convinced the stars to sign on have not yet come to
grips with our views points given the fact that this has been relayed to
them time and time again in our numerous meetings.  It is obvious that our
interests and our perspectives don't blend with their Agenda, thus one can't
help but feel that those groups will forsake the interests of others just to
achieve their Agenda and unfortunately, with a strong possibility of a
change of government this could be a detriment to all groups not just First
Nations.

Granted logging still continues in Clayoquot Sound but it becomes debatable
over whether or not such logging is at the magnitude that it was
pre-Clayoquot Sound Land Use decision (aka 1993).  Clearcutting continues?
Again, it is a given that some form of clearcut continues but what has yet
to be agreed to within all circles is the "what constitutes a clearcut"?
This is not clearly understood within the environment communities nor is it
clearly defined within First Nations commnities as well.  Yet, our position
remains that we do not want a continued repeat of the vast tracts of land
that were stipped clear of all timber.  Has that changed?  In our view, we
are seeing much smaller proposed cutblocks that are nowhere close to what
devastation and destruction that the big corporations have come to be known
for.

Does that indicate that First Nations are happy with the extend of logging
or the type of logging happening in Clayoquot Sound yet?  Absolutely not -
we will continue to push hard for more changes and it is through an uneasy
cooperation with government that we see ourselves having any impact.
Secondly, given that we are now involved in the treaty negotiations over the
management and ownership of those same resources, it is in our interests to
work with the various government agencies to protect our interests until a
treaty is negotiated.  With this latter point, did the information not get
to the stars that given that the Ad was politically motivated to coincide
with the provincial elections that with a change of government our process
of negotiating treaties would come to a complete standstill?  With this at a
standstill, then the steps we've taken to give effect to changes in logging
practises and protecting areas would also be stopped with an unfriendlier
government!

Question # 1:  Protection of Clayoquot Sound's pristine areas would fall
under  what form of protection and what impact would this have on First
Nations in treaty negotiations?  Are all the calls for protection done on
the basis that they are "without prejudice" to the First Nations treaty
negotiations?

It is our view that if the expectation is that the areas being called for
being protected supercede treaty negotiations then those groups who
condemned the government in 1993 for ignoring First Nations are no different
because they would have the same cause and effect!  Why the double
standard?  Again, given that those stars were convinced by those groups to
support the Ad without first communicating with those First Nations directly
impacted by those actions only reflects that those groups are out to meet
their own Agenda at the expense of First Nations interests!  We stood up and
condemned the Provincial Government when they announced their land use plan
in 1993 and we will stand up now to condemn others who try to achieve the
same thing by ignoring the views of First Nations.

> Network, Greenpeace, Natural Resources Defense Council, Coalition for
> Forests, Pacific Environment and Resource Center, and Friends of Clayoquot

> Sound on Vancouver Island, and throughout British Columbia.

It really is becoming disheartening to continuously see that those that
support these types of strategies are also those that supposedly support
First Nations interests!  Yet, we continuously see contradicting statements
and actions that cause First Nations to be very suspicious of the
aspirations of those that claim to support our cause.

The Rainforest Action Network (including the Friends of Clayoquot Sound)
condemned the Science Panel Report by signing onto the Juh-Juh-Dids
Declaration.  Yet, they are part of the groups who condemn the government
for not taking action to enforce those same requirements put forward by the
Science Panel!  Those same groups condemned the B.C. Treaty making process
that would benefit First Nations in taking control over those lands and that
would bring about a definite change in how business is done in all of
British Columbia not just Clayoquot Sound!  Granted, we have since received
a letter from the FOCS Board withdrawing their support to the Juh-Juh-Dids
Council declaration, so it becomes confusing as to who is speaking for who!

Finally, it is not our intention to go to war with the environment community
over this issue because philisophically we have more in common than we all
realize.  Where we begin to separate is our strategies chosen to give effect
to our philosophies!  We don't apologize one bit for the strategies we've
chosen nor do we call upon the environment community to apologize for their
choices.  But, for the average reader we owe it to them to put forward our
perspectives on what we've seen transpire over the course of the last three
years and we must make it clear to the stars and the groups that your
actions don't just affect the government or companies your target but they
hurt First Nations moreso.  With a real possibility of a change of
government we get concerned that the effect that the Ad could have is to
bring in a government that is more sensitive to the desires and interests of
the big business corporations.  If this happens then we are all the losers
in British Columbia - not the stars!

A similar exchange took place on the NATIVE-L mailing list this past
January concerning Clayoquot Sound environmental protection and the
matter of whether or not First Nations people were being consulted or
are party to the process through which efforts to protect forest areas
of British Columbia are devised by environmental organizations.  These

I received this story from a friend in Switzerland and thought the
readers of this conference might enjoy it. He claims it's true.
 - Alan

....

About 1966 or so, a NASA team doing work for the Apollo moon mission took
the astronauts near Tuba City where the terrain of the Navajo Reservation
looks very much like the Lunar surface. Along with all the trucks and large
vehicles, there were two large figures dressed in full Lunar spacesuits.

Nearby a Navajo sheep herder and his son were watching the strange
creatures walk about, occasionally being tended by personnel. The two
Navajo people were noticed and approached by the NASA personnel. Since the
man did not know English, his son asked for him what the strange creatures
were and the NASA people told them that they are just men that are getting
ready to go to the moon. The man became very excited and asked if he could
send a message to the moon with the astronauts.

The NASA personnel thought this was a great idea so they rustled up a tape
recorder. After the man gave them his message, they asked his son to
translate. His son would not.

Later, they tried a few more people on the reservation to translate and
every person they asked would chuckle and then refuse to translate.
Finally, with cash in hand, someone translated the message, "Watch out for
these guys, they come to take your land."

year.  Applications from persons who have lived experience of native culture
and a substantial background in more than one area of the discipline (for
instance, drama or writing), who have interdisciplinary expertise, and who
are able to teach generalist as well as specialized courses are particularly
welcomed.  In most cases the appointment will be at the floor of the
Assistant Professor level (1995-96 salary:  $39, 230).  The University of
Alberta is committed to the principle of equity in employment and welcomes
diversity in the workplace by encouraging applications from all qualified
women and men, including aboriginal people, persons with disabilities, and
members of visible minorities.

The University of Alberta, founded in 1908, has an enrollment of about
30,000 students, including 4,000 graduate students.  The Department of
English at the University of Alberta has more than 60 tenure-track members,
approximately 135 graduate students of whom half are in the Ph.D. programme,
100 Honours programme students and over 700 Arts and Education majors.
Professors and students employ a great variety of critical and scholarly
approaches, including new historicist, cultural materialist, textual,
psychoanalytic, feminist, deconstructionist, game theoretical, Marxist,
psychological, biographical, history-of-ideas, "close reading" old and new,
semiotic, rhetorical, and postcolonial.  Numerous visiting speakers each
year help make this an exciting place to study.

Edmonton is a city of some 600,000 people, situated in the centre of
Alberta on the North Saskatchewan River.  With a rapidly growing native
population that exceeds 5% of the total population, the province is home to
many talented and active native leaders in native culture, particularly art,
drama, film-making, and writing.  For those interested in film, Edmonton is
the site of the Great North Productions film-making company and
Dreamspeakers, an annual week-long celebration of international Aboriginal
films.  Nearby on the Hobbema Reserve is the Muskwachees Cultural College,
owned and operated by four local bands.  Numerous other educational programs
exist, particularly to promote the use of Native languages.  Local support
for language learning is provided in the public school system, which offers
an immersion language program in Cree for elementary children. Native
organizations are an active and important presence in the cultural life of
the city and surrounding areas.



To serve this significant native population, the University of Alberta
implemented in 1990 the Aboriginal Student Policy, which encourages full
access and participation of aboriginal students in all faculties.  The
objective is to increase the current Aboriginal student population of
approximately 800 students to no less than 5% of the total University
enrollment.  In the last two years, the Aboriginal student population has
nearly doubled.  Many successful Aboriginal programmes are available
throughout the University to provide exciting new opportunities for study:

   Ph.D. in Education:  First Nations Focus  The University of Alberta is
the first university in Canada to offer masters' and doctoral degrees in
First Nations education to prepare students to work in either mainstream
universities or in aboriginal settings.  Courses are taught by permanent
staff and by adjunct indigenous faculty, including Howard Adams and Paula
Gunn Allen.
   School of Native Studies  This four-year programme leading to a Bachelor
of Arts fosters respect for aboriginal cultures and prepares students to
address current native issues.  Courses are taught by a team of professors,
community leaders and elders.
   Indigenous Law Program  The Indigenous Law Program in the Faculty of Law
seeks to address the under-representation of aboriginal lawyers in Canada
and to provide a means to articulate aboriginal claims and rights.
   Aboriginal Health Care Careers Program  Health care faculties in
medicine, dentistry, dental hygiene, nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and
medical laboratory science encourage aboriginal applicants by reserving
places for applicants who meet the minimum admission requirements.
   The Transition Year Program  This university credit entrance program
prepares students for admission to various faculties by providing a
combination of degree credit courses, tutorial classes, counselling, and
study skills instruction.
   Aboriginal Student Council  As the official representative body of
aboriginal students at the University of Alberta,  this peer support and
advocacy group provides a voice for aboriginal students and sponsors a
variety of events, including Native Awareness Days.

Candidates with expertise in the field of native literature who are
interested in applying for this position should direct their applications to:

        Good morning...

        Can you direct this message to anyone/organization that might be
able to meet with them? It just came in to the First Nations/Wounded Knee
List.

        Much obliged if you've any ideas...:


Kia ora koutou

I send you all respectful greetings from my people of the land of Hauraki in
Aotearoa ( New Zealand).  I greet you once, I greet you twice, I greet you
three times.  I acknowledge the spirits of our ancestors who have departed
this world to tread the pathway back to the great spirit.  To those of us
who still live in this the world of much confusion, heartache and turmoil, I
greet you all again a thousand fold.

My name is Denise Messiter and I am a Maori woman from the land of Aotearoa
maybe better known to some of you as New Zealand.

I come from a place called Hauraki which is in the North Island of our land.
It is a coastal and rural place.

The reason that I am sending you all this message is that I and another
Maori woman from Hauraki would like to visit with some of the first nations
people from your great island.

I and Josie work for our own peoples organisations so we are not a
government organisation.  I am the General Manager for a Maori health
service and Josie is the Chief Executive Office for our Trust Board.  Both
of these organisations were established out of our peoples stated need to
reclaim our Tino Rangatiratanga (Sovereignity).  There are 12 tribes that
come from Hauraki and we also have other tribal peoples that live here too.

The area of work that myself and Josie work in are Treaty Rights, Land
Claims, Mineral Rights, Fishing Rights, Forestry Rights, Health Rights and a
whole lot of other areas that you are all most probably working in.

As I said earlier we would like to visit with some first nations peoples
organisations from your land who would welcome a visit from us.  Why you may
all ask do we want to visit with you?  We would like to visit with you as we
have heard so much about what is happening to your peoples and we believe
that is being able to visit with some of your first nations peoples we maybe
able to beat the whites at their game.  This has become even more important
for us of late as the government over here is introducing health, social and
economic strategies that they have imported from the white government in
your peoples land.  While the government over here is not able to transport
the total white American dream into our land, they sure have imported what
they feel comfortable with and the parts that ensure they can grab more of
our resources.  This white American way is new to us and while we are able
to anticipate what it may all mean we also hear that some of the things that
the white government in America is doing is of benefit to your peoples.
Mind you we have not heard that from your people.

Anyway my brothers and sisters we were hoping that if it is acceptable to
you that we would be able to visit with some of your peoples in late
July/August of this year.

I would appreciate it if any one of you who gets this message is able to
send to me contact names, addresses, telephone and fax numbers or email
addresses of first nations people organisations or persons from your areas
that would welcome a visit from us in July or August of this year.  We are
particularly interested in visiting with those of your people who have had
their lands, forests, minerals, water and other treasures returned to them
as a result of treaty rights or those of your people who are in the process
of making treaty claims.  We are also interested in visiting with first
nations peoples health organisations as well as the government over here is
considering introducing a health purchasing concept called managed care
which we understand is how the government of America operates the health
system over there.

Well my brothers and sisters from the great island I hope that this message
is received in the spirit in which it is written and that it finds you all
in good health and spirit.

I look forward to receiving replies to my request.

My the great spirit guide and watch over you all

Naku iti noa

Na, Denise

Subject: Military bases & reserves
Date: 14 Jun 1996 09:58:00

I've been wondering recently about Canadian government policy
on military bases and First Nations reserves.

You're probably all familiar with the case of the Stoney Point
reserve that was appropriated in 1942 for a military base.
There are some interesting parallels to a later (60's, I
think), similar example up near Sept-Iles, Quebec. In that
case again, there were two reserves close to each other,
one of which was appropriated for a military base. The
other one (Uashat) had a town growing around it and there
was an attempt to appropriate it at the same time and move
the people from both reserves onto a newly created one
in between them (called Maliotenam, or now sometimes Mani-Utenam).
The people in Uashat managed to resist being relocated
(through some rather clever strategies), and in the
end most of the people relocated to Maliotenam were from
the reserve that had been appropriated for the military base.
Nevertheless, the two reserves were combined into a single
administrative band, and share many of the problems of
conflict within the band as the Stoney Point/Kettle Point
conflict.

So my question is - are these two relocations isolated cases
of colonialist structures and attitudes towards First Nations?
Or was there collusion between Indian Affairs and the Dept.
of Defence at some level - i.e. was the Sept-Iles appropriation
done after seeing the result of the Ipperwash one? Are there
other examples of similar appropriation/relocation/combining
of reserves? I have heard there is at least one other example
in Alberta, but have no details.

There is also a similar, though in some ways different, example
with the low-level flight testing over Nitassinan (Labrador/Quebec).

If anyone has more thoughts or examples, I'd appreciate if you would
please post them here or send them to me.

Thanks,

Alan

PROTEST AGAINST SELF-GOVERNMENT
                        TUESDAY JUNE 18, 1996
                       PARLIAMENT HILL, OTTAWA

On Thursday, June 13th, Bill S-9 'An Act Providing for Self-Government
by the First Nations of Canada' was presented for its first hearing in
the Senate by Native Senator, Walter Twinn.

The second hearing of this Bill will be on Tuesday June 18th.

Mohawk Traditionalists from Kahnawake will be at Parliament Hill to
protest this bill and Self-Government as prescribed by the Canadian
Government.

Ron Irwin stated on January 20th, 1994, during a parliamentary
discussion period that 'Self-Government is based upon developing what
exists from the Two Row Wampum Treaty'.

The Two Row Wampum Treaty belongs to the Traditional Longhouse Chiefs of
the Five Nations Confederacy, not the Indian Actors of the Elected Band
Council System.

Self-Government as prescribed, in its present form, jeopardizes the
treaty rights of all Native People (hunting, fishing, border crossing,
tax exemptions, etc...) and municipalizes all Native Reserves and
Territories.

The Enfranchisement of the Native People that Chretien's White Paper of
'69 prescribed is now quietly being inflicted upon the Native People of
this land under his regime.

Join with the Traditional Mohawk People at Parliament Hill on Tuesday
June 18, 1996 to stop the genocidal policy of Self-Government.

Contact (514) 638-4357 for more information

Also call Walter Twinn at (613)943-1457
to let him know that you don't want this Self-Government Bill passed and
that it is a violation of the Two Row Wampum Treaty

Title: CANADA-HUMAN RIGHTS: Extremist Groups a ''Growing Phenomenon'' in
Canada

by Barbara Borst

TORONTO, Jun 12 (IPS) - In a recent report to Parliament, the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) said there are very
few people here who seek to ''move the political agenda through
violence.''

Public and private groups that monitor hate groups disagree.

Rosemary Brown of the Security Intelligence Review Committee,
an independent, government-appointed body, warns that it would be
''a very serious mistake for either CSIS, SIRC (Security
Intelligence Review Committee), or, indeed, th}s nation to think
that right-wing activity in this country is on the decline or that
it is not a threat.''

Karen Mock, national director of the League for Human Rights of
B'nai Brith Canada, says her group's research on extremism across
Europe and North America shows that it is ''a growing phenomenon''
here and elsewhere.

One of the rallying points for hate groups in Canada is
opposition to immigration. The face of the nation is changing
dramatically as an increasing number of Asian, Caribbean and
African people migrate here.

The groups also oppose legal protections for homosexuals and
rights for native peoples.

Linking these causes with the hatred of Jews and blacks
expounded by the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, extremists have
inspired acts of hatred that have shocked Canadians, who pride
themselves on a less violent political and more tolerant social
climate than that of their neighbor, the United States.

The extent of the problem became obvious in 1993, when an
investigation into the killing of a Somali youth by Canadian
soldiers while on a humanitarian mission to Somalia revealed
members of the elite Airborne Regiment belonged to extreme-right
organizations.

In response, the military disbanded the regiment and set a
policy of ''zero tolerance'' for racist conduct, including
membership in extremist organizations. (Human rights organizations
argue that a fuller investigation is still urgently needed.)

Concern about the growth of hate crimes is fueling
investigations by all levels of government.

The Metropolitan Toronto Council has commissioned a study, due
in July, by the League for Human Rights on the nature and extent
of hate activity in the Toronto area.

Charles Smith of the council's Anti-Racism, Access and Equity
Committee says Toronto police statistics show an increase in hate
crime, particularly against racial minorities and native
Canadians.

Although anti-Semitic acts have been tracked for years, there
is insufficient data concerning racial minorities, indigenous
peoples, immigrants, gays and lesbians, he said.

In 1995 there were 290 reported anti-Semitic incidents,
according to the league, ''the highest number reported in 14 years
of documentation.''

The World Anti-Fascism League in Montreal filed a report with
the U.N. Human Rights Commission in February citing ''racism,
xenophobia and intolerance,'' especially stemming from Quebec's
push toward independence from Canada.

WAL's Peter Vorias says extremist groups include the National
Movement for the Liberation of Quebec and Roman Catholic right-
wing groups such as Cercle Jeune Nation and Centre d'Information
Nationale Robert Rumilly.

The CSIS reported that in Quebec ''extremists on both sides
have issued isolated threats, including death threats against
political leaders.''

Warren Kinsella, in his 1995 book 'Web of Hate', chronicles the
activities of the extreme right in the western prairies and major
cities, exposing their international connections.

''Across Canada, in every region, in almost every town and
city, the web of hate continues to spread,'' writes Kinsella, a
journalist, lawyer and former special assistant to Jean Chretien,
now prime minister.

Extremists have been charged with brutalizing gays and members
of minority groups, assaulting anti-racists, defacing synagogues,
burning crosses and disseminating hate propaganda.

Many of the names play on democratic ideals -- the Canadian
Free Speech League, Citizens for Foreign Aid Reform. Others,
however, boldly announce their agenda with names such as Aryan
Nations, White Aryan Resistance (WAR) and the Hammerskins.

CSIS says the extreme right is composed of a variety of groups
drawn to the same issues but ''without a central leadership, a
phenomenon they find to be a source of strength.''

''Prominent members...establish the broad direction of the
movement, and decisions on what actions to take rest with
individuals or small cells,'' according to the CSIS.

However, the League for Human Rights says extremists are ''not
a loose amalgamation of like-minded malevolents,'' but rather ''an
organized network of groups and individuals'' promoting hatred of
nearly all the ethnic groups that form multicultural Canada.

Extremists, Mock warns, use media interviews and computer
networks to spread their message, often targeting alienated youth
in schools across the country.

Some extremist groups, however, have found that publicity is
also their foe.

Exposure in the news media, and in court, has reduced the
Toronto-based Heritage Front's prominence and finances. Image-
conscious officials from the conservative Reform Party expelled
members who belonged to the Heritage Front.

Canadian law, which makes it a crime to preach hatred of
identifiable groups, has been used to shut down the Heritage Front
Hotline and other phone-in operations.

The conviction of Alberta high school teacher James Keegstra
for promoting anti-Semitism was recently upheld by the Supreme
Court, which has also backed the provincial New Brunswick Human
Rights Commission order that barred an elementary school teacher
who authored books denying the Holocaust and accusing Jews of
international conspiracy from the classroom.

There also has been a backlash -- sometimes violent -- against
the extreme right.

Kinsella writes of Anti-Racist Action and Skinheads Against
Racial Prejudice, both of which have clashed violently with the
far right.

Additionally, the CSIS says Militant Direct Action Task Force,
a previously unknown group, mailed two pipe bombs last year to
white supremacists.(end/ips/bb/pz/96)

Greetings.

I'm forwarding an article which was circulating the 'net several months back, in
case some of you missed it.  It was written by Allen Gabriel of the Mohawk 
Nation, who can be reached at: bf145@freenet.carleton.ca

*************************
Mohawk Nation News Service

I went to check out the First Nations' International Court of Justice,
held at the Radisson Hotel in Ottawa, yesterday. This forum is hearing
evidence from citizens of various indigenous nations. This evidence will
be used to support an indictment, charging the Queen, and her
representatives of the artificial construct commonly referred to as
Canada, with crimes against the indigenous peoples.

Oren Lyons was one of the witnesses called to testify before the
F.N.I.C.J. What I found particularly interesting was the substantial
representation of the so-called "warrior society", the "Mohawk Nation News
Service" (M.N.N.S.) and the First Nations Business League (F.N.B.L.), who
were also in attendance.

During a break, Oren was engaged in a conversation with two ladies whom I
happen to know. Suddenly, they were pushed aside by Art Montour, Loran
Thompson and their entourage, who announced they had questions for Oren.
They proceeded to surround Oren and accost him with a barrage of questions
and accusations.

Later in the day, the M.N.N.S. issued a "press release" attacking Mr.
Lyons. I will not reproduce the item in its entirety here but, suffice it
to say that it contains the usual misinformation and distortions that are
the norm for M.N.N.S. releases. But then, journalistic integrity and
ethics are not principles that guide this propaganda machine of the
"warrior society." You see the M.N.N.S. doesn't report news, it launches
personal attacks against people they view as their enemies. These attacks
are invariably initiated under the guise of "news" stories.

The lead-in quote states, "The First Nations International Court of
Justice is a good idea, but it is only as good as the credibility of the
people involved." Now, none of the quotes contained in this diatribe are
attributed to anyone. Also, the M.N.N.S. itself has no credibility, except
with their supporters, so I'd be skeptical of any source the M.N.N.S.
deems reliable.

But, who are these people? Well, here's a thumbnail sketch. 

In 1989, a delegation of so-called warriors, led by Art Montour and Paul
Delaronde, attended a meeting of the Onondaga Nation Council. The men
announced that they no longer recognized the Rotiianehson of the
Confederacy as their representatives. "We no longer recognize you as our
leaders," Council was told, "you no longer speak for us." Then, once their
message had been delivered, they all got up and walked out of the Onondaga
Longhouse, thereby ending all discussion on the matter. What they'd just
done was to put themselves outside the protective circle of the
Rotinonsionni (People of the Longhouse or Iroquois Confederacy). At that
moment they became invisible. No longer would they be seen by their
people, nor their voices heard in Council or elsewhere.

On July 11, 1990 -- in the Pines at Kanesatake -- the "warrior society"
used Elders, women and children as their human shields against the police.
The media portrayed the people there as innocent victims of an oppressive
nation state (true enough). Their cause was a noble and honourable one --
the protection of ancestral lands from development into a private golf
course. The media also painted a picture of the noble warrior --
honourable men defending the nation and its citizens. Many people bought
into this romantic image.

The public had apparently forgotten that these same "knights in shining
armour" -- a few months earlier at Akwesasne -- had been beating and
shooting at their own people in order to defend the operators of gambling
houses. The public image of the "warrior society" was badly tarnished as a
result of their actions at Akwesasne. The land issue at Kanesatake gave
them the perfect opportunity to achieve two main objectives: re-polish
their image and consolidate their political control. It is my belief that
the gunfight that summer was inevitable. The SQ (Quebec provincial police)
wanted to kick some ass and the warriors needed a crisis to rebuild some
credibility as defenders of indigenous rights.

Then there was their testimony in court during the trials of the "TC-39",
those who held out in the treatment centre before surrendering on
September 26, 1990, as well as before the coroner charged with determining
the circumstances leading to the death of SQ Corporal Marcel Lemay, killed
on July 11, 1990 (an event that has been celebrated by these people every
July 11th since then). During these proceedings, the "warrior society" won
a significant legal precedent by having the court allow their witnesses to
be sworn in using wampum strings. They then proceeded to violate this
sacred ceremony by lying to the judges and coroner.

The First Nations Business League, formerly known as the Iroquois
Businessmen's Association, is a consortium of people from several
Rotinonsionni nations who got their start running tobacco and fuel
products. While some of these "business people" may deal in legitimate
commodities, others are involved in drugs, tobacco, fuel, alcohol, arms,
illegal aliens -- anything you can think of. Are these the types of
activities we want to leave as a legacy for the future? Are these the
tools we want to use in rebuilding our nations? I say no thanks. 

When the trade in was in its infancy, and before it reached its pinnacle a
few years ago, the Rotiianehson (Chiefs) of the Confederacy foresaw many
of the problems we currently face as a result of the activities of
unscrupulous members of our society, namely the First Nations Business
League, the "warrior society" and other people who are engaged in
questionable activities.

A committee of the Iroquois Confederacy drafted a policy document for the
establishment of a Trade and Commerce Commission. The TCC proposed joint
regulation of economic activities among U.S., Canadian and Haudenosaunee
citizens, by their governments, on a nation-to-nation basis according to
existing treaty relations. The proposal was blocked by representatives of
the Oneida Nation Council and several Mohawks, all of whom wanted nothing
to do with regulation in any form.

Today, there's an unholy alliance between the groups I've outlined above.
Their message is clear. They want their economic activities to continue,
without any regulation whatsoever so they can monopolize "trade", maximize
their profits, and continue to make millions. They've built an empire on
the backs of our future generations, by exploiting our collective rights,
without distinction as to what activities may be deemed acceptable and
those that are undesirable and dangerous.

They have recently escalated their attempts to gain legitimacy, and
influence policy to their advantage, through various means. Some have run
in band and tribal council elections. Others have taken key positions
within these foreign governmental structures. They even tried to meet with
the governor of New York State, George Pataki, but they were rebuffed.

They back gambling interests who want to sell out our rights. The
federally elected Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe and the Mohawk Council of
Kanesatake, for instance, have both explicitly adopted foreign laws in
order to establish gambling operations in these communities.

We are faced with a choice. Do we want to work towards restoring treaty
relations, which were established on the basis of peace, respect and
friendship? This is what the Confederacy, and the nation councils, have
been pursuing. They've been trying to protect our sovereignty, while
preserving the principles and values that have been passed on to us by
previous generations.

Or do we want to pursue an existence based on isolationism? Do we want to
become like the oppressors we resent? Do we want to become citizens of a
capitalist state, where a few have all the power and the majority lives in
need? Is this what we want our society to be based on? Again, I say, no
thanks.

And as for the "warrior society", the "Mohawk Nation News Service" and the
First Nations Business League, beware these devils of deception.

______________________________ Forward Header __________________________________
Subject: Onkwehonwe Languages Conference
Author:  bf145@freenet.carleton.ca

MEDIA ADVISORY -- June 17, 1996

ONKWEHONWE LANGUAGES AND WORLDVIEW -- A CONFERENCE

HOSTED BY THE STUDENTS OF KAWENNI':IO/GAWENI:YO HIGH SCHOOL

WHERE: Kawenni':io/Gaweni:yo High School, corner of Seneca and Sour
Springs Roads, Six Nations of the Grand River Territory.

WHEN: Friday June 21 to Sunday June 23 (see attached agenda, which
includes directions to the school).

WHY: To bring together parents and educators, from other Hodinohsoni
communities and nations, so they may assess and evaluate the curriculum of
the Kawenni':io/Gaweni:yo High School. Organizers will share the hands-on
experience they've gained in their ten years of involvement in the
planning and implementation of curriculum geared specifically to the
Onkwehon:we. It is also hoped the conference will encourage our youth and
fluent speakers to pursue careers in teaching.

MEDIA CONTACT: Allen Gabriel at (613) 234-7283, Fax: (613) 235-4040.

Of Special Interest:

- The concept for the school was developed, and is driven, by the parents
of the students. Working closely with leaders of the Hodinohsoni (People
of the Longhouse or Iroquois), they have developed a unique and exciting
curriculum which brings to life the distinct culture the Hodinohsoni.

- The school has provided an opportunity for young people to build
self-esteem by restoring, in them, a strong sense of identity.

- The program provides the necessary skills to ensure the continued growth
of our culture and society. Our youth are able to express their modern
perspectives within the context of the languages and worldview of our
living, thriving culture.

- In its June 1996 report, The Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs
and Northern Development encouraged the government to support communities
which provide students with "a complete education that places emphasis on
culture and language and provides students with a solid foundation in
subjects required for post-secondary education and employment." This
program does that, and can be a model for other communities.

Highlights include:

- Participants include parents who could not speak their languages prior
to this program being implemented, and who are now teaching the languages
in the school.

- There will be presentations on the history of the school, and on the
curriculum and its outcomes. Faithkeepers and Elders panels demonstrate
the integration of the community as a whole into the curriculum.

- There will be displays on computer applications to Onkwehonwe languages,
and on curricula from visiting communities.

This morning I was visited by a woman from the Tlingit & Haida Tribes
of Alaska.  She would like to attend community college in Ontario,
Canada.  Does anyone know whether funding is available for a Native
American living and attending school in Canada?  She has dual
citizenship and has never actually lived in Alaska.  Her family is
from north Vancover Island...some with Canadian citizenship, some
with American citizenship, and some with both.  I don't know what to
suggest to her.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  BIA
regulations re: Post Secondary Funding would be great.

A Visit to Ipperwash

Last September, police shot and killed Anthony "Dudley" George
during a confrontation with a group of native people occupying
Ipperwash Provincial Park. At that time, the North America
Project made a brief visit and decided to support other groups
who were already working in the area. Over the past months, we
have been encouraged to consider a more active involvement, and a
NAP team spent four days in the area at the end of May.

A Short Summary of the Conflict

The immediate conflict dates from 1942 when the Stoney Point
Reserve was taken by the federal government under the War
Measures Act for a military base.  The twenty two families who
had lived at Stoney Point, an area of 2240 acres, were forcibly
relocated to the nearby Kettle Point Reserve. Many eventually
moving away, since they were relocated onto swamp land.

The terms of the appropriation were that the land would be
returned after the war, but that promise was not fulfilled. At
the time of the relocation, the government offered $50,000 in
compensation for the relocation. Over the years, protests to the
government resulted in additional money being paid - in 1980 $2.4
million in compensation was given to the Kettle and Stony Point
Band Council for this purpose.

In May 1992 a group of Native people began occupying part of the
military base. In 1994 the federal government announced plans for
its return. On July 30th 1995, the army abandoned the camp
completely after being forced out before the date they had
planned to move out. The occupiers identify themselves as the
Stoney Point people, even though they are not recognized by the
federal government as an independent band. The Stoney Pointers
say that they are ones to whom the land should be returned. In
opposition to this, the Kettle Point Band Council had been
negotiating for the land's return as a part of a combined Kettle
and Stony Point reserve.

On September, 4th, 1995 about 35 Native people occupied Ipperwash
Provincial Park. It is a small park located in one corner of the
base, and it had closed for the season. The occupiers said that
the park had been built on a sacred burial ground and belongs to
the Stoney Point people. On Sep 6, a confrontation between the
OPP and the occupants resulted in the death of one of the
occupiers, Anthony (Dudley) George, killed by a shot from the
OPP.

Details of the events surrounding the shooting varied widely at
the time. The OPP claimed that they had been responding to a
local disturbance, had been set upon by armed natives, and fired
only in self-defence. The native people claimed that the OPP had
intentionally attacked them with a well-armed riot squad, and
that they themselves were unarmed. A few weeks after the
shooting, a Special Investigations Unit (SIU) that investigates
all police shooting began their work. It has taken a long time,
but a report is expected to be published soon.

Ipperwash Park has not opened to the public this year. A week
after the shooting, the federal government revealed documents
supporting the native claim to the burial ground.

Over the winter, many of the Native people involved in the
incidents of July 30 and Sep 6 of last year have been served with
notice of trials for small and rarely used criminal charges. This
has greatly angered them, as it shows a familiar bias in the
justice system. These charges not only serve to distort public
perception of the incident and focus attention away from the
underlying injustices that gave rise to the incident, they are a
form of harassment of those charged, some of who are having
difficulty finding resources to defend themselves in court.

On May 28, one of the native men charged in the September
shooting incident was acquitted. On May 29 an article was
published by the Toronto Star that gave evidence of a secret
emergency meeting held by the provincial Interministerial
Committee for Aboriginal Emergencies on Sep 5. The reason for the
meeting was the occupation of Ipperwash park the day before - the
implication was that the shooting of Dudley George the day after
was a direct result of a political decision from high up.

The Current Situation

The federal government and representatives from both the Kettle
Point Band Council and the Stoney Pointers are in negotiations.
It is not clear whether this will succeed in transferring
official control of the base back as Native land. The status of
Ipperwash Provincial Park is also not clear, but is presumably up
for negotiation.

At the same time, there is an ongoing land claim (since November
1992) for West Ipperwash. This is some 370 acres of beach-front
property of the Kettle Point reserve that had been sold under
questionable conditions around 1928. There is a smaller portion
of Stoney Point in similar conditions. The non-Native community
now living in West Ipperwash are afraid of losing their property
and are organized by the Ontario Federation for Individual Rights
and Equality (ON-FIRE). The president of ON-FIRE is one of these
residents.

According to everyone we spoke to, there is a lot of tension,
aggression (verbal and physical), threats and assaults going on
in the two Reserves and the white community in between them.
Stoney Pointers told of how a box of nails had been scattered on
their road, and of people yelling out their windows as they drive
by. Local residents spoke of Native people threatening them.
Local business and employment is suffering because of the
reduction of tourism. A Kettle Point man told of how a white
resident had tried to provoke him into a fight while having a
camcorder tape the incident.

Relations between the Kettle Point and Stoney Point Reserves has
not been good. The Kettle Pointers (who include some of the
previous Stoney Pointers) consider Stoney Point to be a part of
their community, and appear to have had their own hopes for the
use of the returned land. The Stoney Pointers who are currently
occupying the land are clear that they are a separate First
Nation and have not been well taken care of by Kettle Point. Both
sides say that history supports their claims, and our research
indicates that this is probably true.

PBI-NAP's Involvement

Our goal for this visit was primarily to contact all the
different groups, to introduce PBI, and to offer our services as
observers and reporters. We found that trust was a significant
issue - for example, we were told by the Stoney Pointers that
several undercover police had come at different times claiming to
want to help. It is a particularly sensitive time because of many
impending trials stemming from events of last June and September,
and people are concerned about how reports and information may be
used against them.

Nevertheless, during the four days we spent there, we were able
to have interviews with many people from all the major groups
involved. The interviews gave us a small insight into the
complexity of the conflict - the ongoing low-level conflicts, as
well as the potential for a violent escalation. Potential flash-
points include the release of the SIU report, future trials and
legal processes, and confrontations over the park. These hover
like lids on a kettle, waiting to boil over again. We hope that a
PBI team will be able to offer a useful non-partisan observer
presence in the area to:
 - help the rebuilding of trust between the various parties and
deter further violent incidents
 - nurture the space for a just resolution that hears and
addresses the valid concerns of all parties

[from Peace Brigades International June Project Bulletin]

Barriere Lake Update

In the April Project Bulletin, we described a conflict taking
place involving the Algonquins of Barriere Lake, who live in
Rapid Lake, Quebec, Canada. This conflict involves both a
division within the Algonquins, as well as disputed interests of
outside parties. Within the Algonquins, the split has both family
lines of division, as well as political differences. These
political differences have an impact on important issues to
outside parties, the most important being land and the fate of a
co-management agreement [see April 96 Project Bulletin].

On one side are supporters of the previous chief, Jean-Maurice
Matchewan, and his successor, Harry Wawatie, most of who live in
Rapid Lake. Although Harry Wawatie was selected as chief in a
traditional ceremony, he is not recognized by either the
Department of Indian Affairs, nor the opposing side, known as the
IBC. In Jan 1996, this Interim Band Council (IBC) was recognized
by DIAND as the official representatives for the band until the
conflict could be resolved, on the basis of a petition that had
been circulated during the previous months.

On Apr 11, Harry Wawatie's side presented a proposal for a fact-
finding/mediation process. After a series of public
demonstrations by the residents of Rapid Lake that included
several days' occupation of the lobby of the DIAND offices, the
process was accepted by both DIAND as well as the IBC. The
process involves Judge Rejean Paul as chief mediator, with the
participation of two elders from outside the Algonquin community,
one chosen by each side. The mediation team's mandate has two
parts: writing down the band's electoral custom, and addressing
the social conflicts within Rapid Lake.

An initial difficulty involved the IBC's selection of an elder,
but since then things have been moving forward smoothly. To date
(June 7), the mediation has been working chiefly on the electoral
custom. They have worked through several drafts, getting feedback
from the community via questionnaires. A concern has been raised
about the legal implications of adopting an electoral code, which
could affect the band's relationship with Indian Affairs and
subsequent claims under section 35 of the constitution.

The North America Project's involvement over these past two
months has been one of monitoring progress. We interviewed Harry
Wawatie in April about the history of his community and the
custom of leadership selection.

[Harry Wawatie was chief of the Algonquins of Barriere Lake
in the late 70's, and was recently chosen by one part of
the community as chief.]

PBI Interview with Harry Wawatie, April 16, 1996.

PBI: What is the traditional process for choosing leaders
[amongst the Algonquins of Barriere Lake], and how were you
chosen to become chief?

[Note: Harry refers to himself as "we" in responding to this
question. I didn't ask him why - it might just be a way of
talking from the Algonquin language (his first language), or may
have to do with the fact that leadership is in many ways a shared
responsibility between the chief and his wife.]

H:  In 1957, that's when we were officially recognized as a
leader.  It's not an overnight job, it took a few years before we
became chief.  When we were first chosen, we were just named as
that we were going to be a future leader for the community.

It took two years. In our language, we say if you choose a tree
for some purpose, we blaze it, like a mark. So that's what they
did for us, and this one elder announced it to the community,
explaining a lot about forming the leadership. The reason they
did that is so that the community can look at these leaders, look
at who their next leader is going to be, to watch him. Everybody
looks at him, how they behave, what kind of a future it's going
to be. They looked at us for a long time, to see if anything was
wrong, or if we were involved in bad behaviour.

The community never found any faults against us, so then it
became official - then that's when we were elected, we were
chosen. That's not an elective council, it's a natural election.
In 1957 that's when we became official, but they didn't allow us
to take the leadership for a few years, for training.

So then, in 1957, that's when the federal government claimed the
land settlement and it was about three times the size of what it
is now.  And then in 1961 they never gave us back our full
reserve, just 59 acres.

PBI: Where were you living before that?

H: We were living in Barriere, there were some houses there at
that time. The reason we moved closer, was because we wanted to
get the services - there was no road there at that time. There
was some logging, but they never did clear-cuts, at that time
they used horses.

Back in 1954, still there was not that much damage to the land.
But then they invented this big machinery, and trucks, those big
machines that cut logs that they have today there. That's when
they started damaging lands and forestry and all that, and the
territory, it didn't last 20 years and it's all clearcut and
there's just a few places now that are left, that's all that we
are trying to protect, the little leftover, that's what we try to
depend on.

So, anyway, trying to get back to the background, we built that
community, it was us that built our community. That first year in
1961, we were getting houses, first we had in two years. Then
1964, or 65, we had better housing, and that's when they started
to build the school, in our community.

PBI: Did the kids go to school before that?

H: There were some, not too long ago, that were sent to a
boarding school. All that distance from our community, finally
the parents weren't too happy to see their kids go there, go that
far for a long period of time. They had just a short visit with
them in the summer, a few weeks.

So when we had a school, that's when they brought a little bit
more of services, better roads, better housing, and better
school, and finally we were getting pretty good services then.
And then the problems began increasing, every year. Larger
funding came, more projects. I don't know what's going to happen
next.

PBI: Do you think there's any possibility of writing down what
the traditional practice of selecting leaders would be?

H: I don't know if they (DIAND) would pay attention, because of
all these allegations, all these problems. Well, it could be
possible, to write those things.

PBI: Are there any traditional ways of solving problems if two
groups both claim to be the leader?

H: Yes, that's what I talked about last night. I told them [the
IBC] what our intention was, what we are planning to do. I even
told them, it's not the court that's going to resolve the problem
that they create, it's them, and they have to come up with
solutions.

Ingram-Mooto Project Update

The Ancient Forests of Ingram, Mooto, and Ellerslie Lakes are at the heart
of tne of the largest temperate rainforest ecosystems remaining on Earth.
Currently a campaign is under way to spotlight the proposed clearcut logging
that is planned for this area in 1997 by Western Forest Products. The
following is an update on the project and a call for support from people
world wide.

On May 25th construction of a cabin was begun at the head of Spiller channel
where Ingram Falls empties into the sea. The cabin is serving as a place for
Heiltsuk families and visitors to come together to leam about the ecology
and traditional uses in the area. School groups, teachers, photographers,
and families have been making trips to the Lakes weekly to help with the
construction of the camp, and enjoy fishing, swimming, and exploring.

Sometime beflveen June 7-9 a helicopter pad recently constructed by the
survey crew for Western Forest Products was destroyed. The survey crew has
since relocated the pad a short distance down Spiller Channel.

Culturally Modified Trees (CMTs) have been identified on the south side of
Polallie Creek where it empties into Ingram Lake. Stone fish traps at the
mouth of Ingram Creek also provide testament to the fact that the area has
always been an important harvesting area for the Heiltsuk people. The area
continues to be used for hunting and trapping. All of this indicates,
contrary to Western Forest Products' claims, that the area is extremely
important culturally to the Heiltsuk people.

AN URGENT CALL FOR SUPPORT

The Vickers Family of Bella Bella is asking for supporters to come to Bella
Bella and the camp at Ingram-Mooto. Areas of support include networking,
media, construction, informal wildlife surveys, tree climbing, ecological
education, and general camp support. Trips from the village to camp have
been leaving every Saturday, and when ever there is enough people available
to make a trip.

People who plan to be actively involved with camp operations for a couple of
weeks will have their expenses covered from Bella Bella to the camp.
Additional travel costs, such as ferry expenses from Port Hardy to Bella
Bella, rnay be covered for people who are willing to commit to a month or
more at camp. Once again we are in desperate need of support from people
outside the community of Bella Bella in order to stop the logging that is
planned for this great rainforest.

Donations needed: $$$, climbing equipment, large walled tents, canoes,
kayaks, VHF radios, lap top computer, outboards.
-----

The task of leadership, the first task of concerned people, is not to
condemn or castigate or deplore; it is to search out the reason for
disillusionment and alienation, the rationale of protest and
dissent--perhaps, indeed, to learn from it.

            *** FAN International Update - June 17, 1996 ***




    Hi friends!  Thanks for your continued interest and support for FAN and
our Great Coast Rainforest Campaign.  We've now moved into our spacious new
office in Bella Coola and we're happy and excited to have a permanent home
again!  We have boats in harbour and are ready to blockade at any time...


TRRP (TEMPERATE RAINFOREST RESEARCH PROJECT)

    We've also finished setting up the TRRP camp in the beautiful
Skowquiltz valley (pronounced "so-wilk"), and FAN researchers have begun a
scientific survey of three rare, old-growth dependent species - the marbled
murrelet, the tailed frog, and the Queen Charlotte goshawk.  Each of these
species is provincially classified as threatened or vulnerable.  By
documenting the use of the Skowquiltz as habitat for these species, we hope
to encourage other researchers to come to the area to carry out more
exhaustive studies.  We'll also use the findings of the study to lobby for
a moratorium on logging of the watershed.

    The Skowquiltz is the largest undeveloped primary watershed in the
mid-coast forest district, with one of the last pristine estuaries of its
size in the region.  This ecologically-rich valley forms part of a 1
million hectare roadless area, which we believe is the largest expanse of
intact temperate rainforest left on the planet.  Unfortunately, the
Skowquiltz is slated for roadbuilding in 1998.  This valley is truly one of
the most precious jewels remaining on the whole mainland coast, and we
cannot allow it fall in to the ongoing chainsaw massacre.


CANADIAN RAINFOREST NETWORK

    FAN also participated earlier this month in the launch of a major new
environmental coalition of 20 diverse environmental groups from across B.C.
and the U.S.  We held a press conference on June 6th to announce the
formation of the Canadian Rainforest Network and issue the coalition's
demands for the temperate rainforest.  We also unveiled a new hotspots map
depicting 10 of the most immediately threatened areas on B.C.'s coast.
World renowned scientists Dr. Elliott Norse and Dr. Michael Soule were on
hand to endorse our demands and explain the global importance of protecting
B.C.'s rainforests.  56 other environmental organizations from around the
world also endorsed the CRN's the demands. The demands are:

* to protect key ecological areas of the temperate rainforest
* to stop all clearcutting in the temperate rainforest
* to halt all roadbuilding in the ancient temperate rainforest
* to support the work of First Nations to protect their traditional
      territories and the survival of their cultures, and
* to promote ecologically sustainable community development

    Quite a strong, new stance for some of the more conservative
participants in the coalition!  Indeed, this is the first time we can think
of that such a broad spectrum of environmental groups - from big,
mainstream groups like the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense
Council to small, grassroots, action-oriented groups like FAN - have chosen
to work together in British Columbia.  It's surely a testament to just how
important protecting B.C.'s remaining ancient rainforests is!

    If your organisation wants to officially sign onto the CRN's demands,
contact CRN co-ordinator Jill Thomas at (604) 669-4303, fax (604) 669-6833,
email crn@helix.net

***** Please let us know if you would like a copy of a feature-length
article from the Vancouver Sun on the launch of the coalition.


TRIAL UPDATE

    Currently, FAN is organizing support for the trial of the 22 people
arrested last September at Ista.  (See attached press release.)  The
arrests have had to endure months of repeated trips to Vancouver for court
appearances, only to have the court refuse to address the jurisdiction
question.  Most have also spent several days or even weeks in jail already.
We are now hoping for a speedy resolution of the trial so that everyone
can get on with the other important battles that still lie ahead of us this
summer!


AAC LETTER-WRITING CAMPAIGN

    Unfortunately, the fight does not end with Ista.  There are still many
key pristine areas within Nuxalk territory and elsewhere in the Great Coast
Rainforest scheduled for roadbuilding or clearcutting this summer, and even
more in the following few years.  The level of cutting in most areas of the
province, known as the A.A.C. (Annual Allowable Cut), continues to far
exceed even the government's own estimates of what is sustainable. (For
example, in the mid-coast forest district around Bella Coola, the rate is
47% above what the government has estimated to be sustainable.)  And most
ecologists and ecoforesters would agree that even the government's
estimates of what is sustainable are far too high.  Despite the claims of
sweeping forest reform that the B.C. government has been loudly trumpeting
to the international community, very little has actually changed on the
ground. Clearcutting continues to be used in over 90% of all logging done
in the province, and the new Forest Practices Code has actually resulted in
an increase in roadbuilding into pristine areas.  By limiting the size of
clearcuts and restricting how close together they can be, without lowering
the amount of wood being cut, the Forest Practices Code has actually
dispersed the destruction over about 4 times as great an area!  The truth
remains that the greed for short-term corporate profits means too much is
being taken too fast, leaving behind a legacy of impoverished local
communities as well as degraded ecosystems.

Subject: Clayoquot Blockade

   After two and one-half days of blockading logging operations in
Clayoquot Sound, the Friends of Clayoquot Sound and Greenpeace have agreed
to temporarily suspend the blockades pending the outcome of talks between
all parties. The following two news releases describe the setting up of the
blockades and the joint statement issued by Friends of Clayoquot,
Greenpeace, and the Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations which led to the temporary
suspension.
   Our position has not changed from that which led to the setting up of
the blockades and we must be ready to resume them at any time. We need your
help for this. Let us known if you could support the resumption of the
blockades. We will keep you informed on how the situation developes.

You can reach us at: phone - (604) 725-4218; fax - (604) 725-2527
or e-mail us at focs.web.apc.org

Please read the following news releases and call us if you have questions.


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
ACTIVISTS BLOCKADE LOGGING OPERATION IN CLAYOQUOT SOUND
Protest Highlights Ongoing Destruction of Temperate Rainforest

(TOFINO, B.C.) Thursday, 20 June, 1996 - Activists from Greenpeace and the
Friends of Clayoquot Sound today are blockading a logging operation in
Clayoquot Sound, using the Greenpeace vessel MV Moby Dick and inflatable
boats. Three activists are chained to the log loader, which is used to load
logs onto trucks to be taken out of Clayoquot.

The blockade occurs almost one year after the Science Panel's
recommendations for Clayoquot were adopted by the B.C. government. The
protest is designed to highlight ongoing destructive logging by both
International Forest Products (Interfor) and MacMillan Bloedel. Contrary to
recommendations by the Science Panel, MacBlo has already begun clearcutting
one of Clayoquot's pristine valleys.

"Canadians have a right to know that Clayoquot Sound's rainforests are
still being destroyed. A year after the Science Panel, the pristine areas
remain on the chopping block," said Karen Mahon of Greenpeace. "The
band-aid solutions that have been tried in Clayoquot have not worked. We
need to protect the rainforest valleys before we lose them forever."

Greenpeace and the Friends of Clayoquot Sound are calling for full
protection of all the remaining pristine rainforest areas in Clayoquot
Sound. MacMillan Bloedel is currently logging in the Bulson watershed in
Clayoquot Sound, an area that government reports consider pristine.
According to the Science Panel, no logging should occur in the pristine
areas.

"Logging has slowed down in Clayoquot Sound, but the companies are still
doing extreme damage as they creep silently into the pristine watershed of
the Bulson," said Valerie Langer of the Friends of Clayoquot Sound. "Its
time to get our priorities straight and restore salmon habitat instead of
destroying it."

Interfor is logging in Rolling Stone Creek directly adjacent to an area
where they were recently found in violation of the Forest Practices Code
(Sec. 63.2) for negligent road building which resulted in stream damage. As
a result, Interfor was fined $10,000 but the Ministry of Forests has not
released this information to the public. According to the guidelines of
performance-based logging under the Forest Practices Code, Interfor should
not have received a permit to log in this area in the first place. However,
they are currently applying for further permits to log in Rolling Stone.

"The ongoing destruction of Clayoquot Sound revealed today is an
international scandal," said Tzeporah Berman of Greenpeace International.
"The industry and government have led the world to believe that the
controversy is solved. We will ensure that customers in Europe and the U.S.
are informed of the continued threat to Clayoquot's remaining pristine
rainforests."

* Note to Editors: An MoF report by Alan Chapman lists the Bulson watershed
as only 1.1% impacted. The Science Panel defines a watershed as pristine as
less than 2% impacted.



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

JOINT STATEMENT OF THE NUU-CHAH-NULTH FIRST NATIONS, GREENPEACE, AND THE
FRIENDS OF CLAYOQUOT SOUND.

(CLAYOQUOT SOUND) Saturday 22 June, 1996 - Greenpeace and the Friends of
Clayoquot Sound agreed today to a temporary suspension of the blockades in
Clayoquot Sound.

Greenpeace and the Friends of Clayoquot Sound acknowledge our breach of
protocol for not discussing our activities with the chiefs of the
Nuu-Chah-Nulth Central Region prior to the protest.

The NCN First Nations commit to facilitate a meeting with all parties in
two weeks to address the concerns of the protesters and work towards
finding a solution to the issues that led to this conflict.

All three parties view the activities this week as a warning to government
and industry that change needs to happen faster in Clayoquot Sound.

The Greenpeace ship, the MV Moby Dick, has been invited to remain in
Clayoquot Sound to tour the area.

NEWS RELEASE
Thursday, June 27, 1996

JUDGE GIVES NUXALK DEFENDANTS SUSPENDED SENTENCES,
Non-native environmentalists singled out as ring-leaders

VANCOUVER, B.C. - This morning in the Supreme Court of British Columbia,
Justice Kenneth Smith sentenced 16 of the 21 people convicted Tuesday for
criminal contempt of court for defying a court order prohibiting them from
interfering with Interfor's roadbuilding operations at Ista (Fog Creek)
near Bella Coola.  Each of the 13 Nuxalk Nation citizens, including
Hereditary Chiefs Nuximlayc (Lawrence Pootlass), Qwatsinas (Edward Moody)
and Slicxwliqw' (Charles Nelson), were given suspended sentences and 1 year
probation for their part in last September's month-long stand.  Meanwhile
the three non-native defendants, who had been invited by the Hereditary
Chiefs to support the Nuxalk in stopping the destruction of this sacred and
ecologically important area, were singled out as instigators and given both
jail time and two years probation. (Arielle Stein and Alecia DuCharme each
received 30 days, while Jacinta French received 15 days plus $1000 fine.)

In handing out the sentences, Justice Smith acknowledged that unlike in the
Clayoquot Sound cases, the Nuxalk had been acting out of a direct concern
for their own survival in protecting the land that they relied on for their
sustenance and the continuation of their cultural traditions.  He gave
this, as well as that fact that the Nuxalk have already suffered
considerable hardship and expense as a result of their arrests, as
mitigating factors which led him to give the Nuxalk citizens a relatively
lenient sentence.  For the non-native activists, on the other hand, the
judge went as far as to suggest that not only had they been the principal
organizers of the protest, but that they had used the Nuxalk for their own
ends to gain media exposure for the issue and actually led the Nuxalk to
commit criminal contempt.  He asserted that clearly the sentences for the
Clayoquot cases had not acted as a sufficient deterrent, and thus he would
have to increase the stakes by giving out harsher sentences.

"While we are extremely pleased that our Nuxalk friends will not be
persecuted with further jail time for their efforts to defend their land
and sovereignty," said FAN spokesperson Diana Wilson, "we are thoroughly
disgusted with the paternalistic attitude of the court in suggesting that
the Nuxalk were not consciously acting on their own conviction in getting
arrested for Ista.  It is typical of the lingering colonial bias in our
legal system that the non-native guests of the Nuxalk were portrayed as the
masterminds of the affair, as if the natives were still legally to be
considered children, or wards of the state.  FAN rejects that
characterization, and so do the Nuxalk - it is equally insulting to us
both."

Five people still await sentencing. Two non-native defendants, who have
both been singled out as more serious offenders, Greg Higgs, who made
national television by burning a copy of the court order and Bill Joyce,
who has a previous conviction for contempt of court, will be sentenced on
July 8.  Three more native defendants will be sentenced on Oct. 18.

NEWS RELEASE
Thursday, June 27, 1996

JUDGE GIVES NUXALK DEFENDANTS SUSPENDED SENTENCES,
Non-native environmentalists singled out as ring-leaders

VANCOUVER, B.C. - This morning in the Supreme Court of British Columbia,
Justice Kenneth Smith sentenced 16 of the 21 people convicted Tuesday for
criminal contempt of court for defying a court order prohibiting them from
interfering with Interfor's roadbuilding operations at Ista (Fog Creek)
near Bella Coola.  Each of the 13 Nuxalk Nation citizens, including
Hereditary Chiefs Nuximlayc (Lawrence Pootlass), Qwatsinas (Edward Moody)
and Slicxwliqw' (Charles Nelson), were given suspended sentences and 1 year
probation for their part in last September's month-long stand.  Meanwhile
the three non-native defendants, who had been invited by the Hereditary
Chiefs to support the Nuxalk in stopping the destruction of this sacred and
ecologically important area, were singled out as instigators and given both
jail time and two years probation. (Arielle Stein and Alecia DuCharme each
received 30 days, while Jacinta French received 15 days plus $1000 fine.)

In handing out the sentences, Justice Smith acknowledged that unlike in the
Clayoquot Sound cases, the Nuxalk had been acting out of a direct concern
for their own survival in protecting the land that they relied on for their
sustenance and the continuation of their cultural traditions.  He gave
this, as well as that fact that the Nuxalk have already suffered
considerable hardship and expense as a result of their arrests, as
mitigating factors which led him to give the Nuxalk citizens a relatively
lenient sentence.  For the non-native activists, on the other hand, the
judge went as far as to suggest that not only had they been the principle
organizers of the protest, but that they had used the Nuxalk for their own
ends to gain media exposure for the issue and actually led the Nuxalk to
commit criminal contempt.  He asserted that clearly the sentences for the
Clayoquot cases had not acted as a sufficient deterrent, and thus he would
have to increase the stakes by giving out harsher sentences.

"While we are extremely pleased that our Nuxalk friends will not be
persecuted with further jail time for their efforts to defend their land
and sovereignty," said FAN spokesperson Diana Wilson, "we are thoroughly
disgusted with the paternalistic attitude of the court in suggesting that
the Nuxalk were not consciously acting on their own conviction in getting
arrested for Ista.  It is typical of the lingering colonial bias in our
legal system that the non-native guests of the Nuxalk were portrayed as the
masterminds of the affair, as if the natives were still legally to be
considered children, or wards of the state.  FAN rejects that
characterization, and so do the Nuxalk - it is equally insulting to us
both."

Five people still await sentencing. Two non-native defendants, who have
both been singled out as more serious offenders, Greg Higgs, who made
national television by burning a copy of the court order and Bill Joyce,
who has a previous conviction for contempt of court, will be sentenced on
July 8.  Three more native defendants will be sentencing on Oct. 18.

I apologize for the length of this post but I think you'll find it of
interest. And I KNOW you're just going to get a warm, fuzzy feeling inside
knowing the Canadian government has taken this initiative (yes, that is
sarcasm). My editorial comment will follow once I've read this thing more
closely. Here goes...

CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY

His Excellency
the Right Honourable Romo LeBlanc
Governor General of Canada
RIDEAU HALL

SPEECH ON THE OCCASION OF
THE SIGNING OF THE PROCLAMATION
FOR NATIONAL ABORIGINAL DAY

Rideau Hall
Thursday, June 13, 1996

We are here to proclaim National Aboriginal Day, and to express Canada's
respect for the First Nations, Inuit, and Metis in our past, our present,
and our future.

Many cities in Canada are less than a hundred years old. But aboriginal
people have lived in this land for more than a hundred centuries. From
coast to coast and in the Arctic. they first explored our lakes and
rivers; they first mastered our forests and prairies,- and they helped
those who came later to join them.

In the year 1624, a French missionary wrote these words about the natives
who fed and housed him: "They hold it proper to help passers-by, and to
receive courteously among them every person who is not their clear
enemy.... They see to all necessities for one another. so that them are no
poor beggars among them; and they think it great evil when they hear that
in France, great numbers of people are poor and begging."

The first Europeans to arrive here found a populated continent, with
hundreds of aboriginal cultures, almost all of them sharing high qualities
of skill, bravery, consensus, and compassion. Those first peoples taught
the newcomers the medicines, food, and clothing that let them survive and
[to construct?] tbe canoes and snowshoes that gave them transport.

[ There was missing text at the end of the above paragraph, which I have
  attempted to fill in.  --Gary (gst@gnosys.svle.ma.us) ]

But I will repeat what I have said in this room before. The aboriginal
people who gave us the keys to Canada found the door closed to them at
Confederation.

And still today, great challenges remain for aboriginal communities. But
perhaps a new tide is rising. Some speak of a native renaissance, as the
first peoples reclaim their rightful place in Canada.

And perhaps once again, Canada will learn from the native people.

In the past year, on behalf of Canadians, I have honoured many members of
aboriginal communities for their high achievements. And I recognize the
presence of remarkable individuals here today.

Through National Aboriginal Day, Canada will now extend proud recognition
to all the first peoples. Already the Assembly of First Nations and the
province of Quebec have marked the special significance of June 21st and
the summer solstice. With today's proclamation, we will extend that
recognition into a national day of awareness and of celebration for all
Canadians; and I commend Elijah Harper and all of those responsible.

On June 21st, this year and every year, Canada will honour the native
peoples who first brought humanity to this great land. And may the first
peoples of our past always be full and proud partners in our future.

PRESS RELEASE -- 1-9615

JUNE 21 PROCLAIMED NATIONAL ABORIGINAL DAY

OTTAWA (May 23, 1996) --Canada has declared June 21st -the first day of
summer -National Aboriginal Day.

"Indians, Inuit, and Metis have made unparalleled contributions to the
development of this country," said Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern
Development, Ronald A. Irwin, one of three federal Ministers who made the
announcement. "To recognize these contributions, the Canadian government
has designated June 21st as National Aboriginal Day so that all Canadians
may share and experience the cultures of Indians, Inuit, and Metis in
Canada. The designation of National Aboriginal Day also supports global
initiatives to commemorate the International Decade of the World's
Indigenous Peoples."

"This day of celebration is an opportunity for all Canadians, especially
young people, to learn more about the Aboriginal cultural heritages of
Canada," said the Acting Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Member of
Parliament for St. Henri/Westmount, Lucienne Robillard. "By sharing our
knowledge and experience, there will be greater understanding and harmony
among all Canadians."

The Minister of Natural Resources and the Federal Interlocutor for Metis
and Non-Status Indians, Anne McLellan, echoed the feelings of her Cabinet
colleagues. "Canadians from all walks of life have much to gain from a
greater understanding of the heritages of Indians, Inuit and Metis. By
celebrating together, we can promote an appreciation and acceptance of
each others' points of view."

The announcement is also evidence of Canada's commitment to build a new
partnership with Canada's Indians, Inuit and Metis.

In December 1995, Elijah Harper hosted a Sacred Assembly in Hull, Quebec,
at which a national day to recognize Aboriginal peoples and their
contribution to Canada was discussed. Following consultations, Aboriginal
groups and the federal government selected June 21st. The summer solstice
holds special significance for many Aboriginal groups who already
celebrate their cultures and heritage on that day.

"The official recognition of National Aboriginal Day fulfills an important
commitment undertaken by the government at the Sacred Assembly. I hope
that all Canadians will join Aboriginal communities in celebrating this
momentous occasion, this year and every June 21st," said Elijah Harper,
M.P. for Churchill, Manitoba.

While not a statutory holiday, National Aboriginal Day is a day of
recognition for all Canadians. It will be the first of a series of events,
including St. Jean Baptiste Day on June 24th and Canada Day on July 1st,
to celebrate Canada's culture, heritage and history. "I encourage all
Canadians to take part in all these special days," added Minister Irwin.

BACKGROUNDER -- NATIONAL ABORIGINAL DAY

The Government of Canada has declared June 21st of every year to be
National Aboriginal Day to celebrate the contribution of Aboriginal
peoples to Canadian society as Canada's First Peoples and to recognize
their different cultures.

Officially setting aside a day to recognize the contributions of
Aboriginal peoples to Canada and Canadian society is not new.

* In 1982, the Assembly of First Nations passed a resolution to recognize
June 21 as National Solidarity Day for Indian Peoples.

* In 1990, the Quebec Legislature declared June 21 as a special day to
celebrate Aboriginal culture.

In December 1995, participants at the Sacred Assembly, organized by Elijah
Harper, M.P. for Churchill, Manitoba, suggested establishing a national
day to recognize the contributions of First Nations in the development of
a contemporary Canada. The idea of National Aboriginal Day quickly gained
popularity.

Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Ronald A. Irwin,
endorsed the idea and, early in the new year, consultation with Aboriginal
groups began to choose an appropriate day. June 21 was selected because of
the cultural significance of the summer solstice and because many
Aboriginal groups across the country already hold ceremonies to celebrate
their cultural heritage on that day.

The Order in Council, officially proclaiming June 21 as National
Aboriginal Day, will soon be signed by the Governor General.

Setting aside a day for Aboriginal peoples marks an important step in
wider recognition of the ongoing contributions Canada's First Peoples are
making to this country. Aboriginal peoples are an integral part of the
fabric of Canada.

It is especially appropriate to initiate National Aboriginal Day during
the United Nations International Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples.

"The Government of Canada has declared June 21st of every year to be
National Aboriginal Day to celebrate the contribution of Aboriginal
peoples to Canadian society as Canada's First Peoples and to recognize
their different cultures." -- D.I.A.N.D. Backgrounder (May 1996)

The Canadian government is saying that, once a year, Canadians should
celebrate the Aboriginal Peoples', "...unparalleled contributions to the
development of this country...".

To help everyone celebrate, Indian Affairs has taken the time to develop a
list of suggested activities. This list, however, demonstrates a
fundamental lack of understanding on the part of the people who are
supposed to be the bridge between our peoples. The "meat" of what they
offer, in the form of suggested activities, can only be described as tokenism.

Some of the suggestions contained on this list range from being naive and
uninformed, to being outright offensive. One of my favourite suggestions
is the one for a golf tournament. Being Kanienkehaka (Mohawk) from
Kanesatake, my first thought was to call Jean Ouellette, Sam Elkas and Tom
Siddon to set up a foursome and hit the links at the Oka Golf Course this
afternoon. The only problem is, who'll caddie for us?

[ This comment refers to the violent confrontation that took place at a
  location immediately adjacent to a Mohawk burial ground at Oka, Quebec
  during the summer of 1990.  There is a great deal of information on
  this subject available in the archives of the NATIVE-L mailing list
  ("http://bioc09.uthscsa.edu/natnet/archive/nl/" or from the LISTSERV
  (send "get nn-intro archives native-l" to "listserv@tamu.edu"))  --Gary ]

Indian Affairs also suggests that a community feast, such as a potlatch,
could be organized over the lunch hour. As far as I know, a potlatch is an
elaborate celebration -- which includes ceremonies, dancing to traditional
songs, a feast and giveaways -- which can last several days. It can hardly
be squeezed into a lunch hour. Someone in Indian Affairs is confusing a
potlatch and a potluck meal.

There is a problem with the concept of a national, or international,
"day." Take Earth Day, for example. Every April the world, for one day,
is supposed to celebrate Mother Earth. People "tsk, tsk" the current
situation, politicians make speeches and do something "environmental."
This is supposed to make people feel good about their "concern" for the
environment. Then, during the other 364 days of the year, the rape and
desecration of her gifts to us (you probably know them as natural
resources) continues as usual. No, there's something wrong with that
picture, which is not at all consistent with the approach of most
indigenous cultures.

On a more practical level, some of these ideas may be good ones but,
they'll be difficult to implement because of the I differences inherent in
our respective societies and ways. The Canadian government's continued
approach, in promoting an understanding and appreciation of indigenous
cultures, is to "Canadianize" us.

For example, many of our people take a holistic approach to life -- all
segments of the Circle of Life valuable and are interconnected. Our
spirituality is the fundamental basis of all we do.  Our society is based
on the concept of using a good mind in order to come to one mind on
issues. We have a concept of  leadership that is fundamentally different
from yours. We use different methods to resolve conflict. We lead a
harmonious existence with all of Creation. All these distinct aspects of
our society flow from the original teachings we received from
Sonkwaiatison, our Creator.

This conflicts with the way Canadians do things. It's been my experience
that attempting to incorporate "traditional activities" such as Smudging,
Opening/Thanksgiving Ceremonies, etc., into a corporate setting often
results in their being treated as just another agenda item. A certain
amount of time is allotted to "the spiritual segment" of the day and then
people go back to business as usual. If the principles inherent in our
ways do not become the fundamental foundation for all we do on a daily
basis, we diminish and trivialize them, and that is the height of disrespect.

 From our perspective, you tend to compartmentalize and segregate virtually
all aspects of your daily lives. Your institutions also reflect that
segmented approach and operate in that manner.

I think the suggestions that deal with treaties, recreation of historical
events and other educational exchanges can all be good things but only if
they're done properly. Whose perspective will prevail, or be given more
weight? We all know there are more than one perception of the same
"historical events." One of the reasons there is such an emotional
backlash to our struggle to retain our place on the earth is that few
Canadians know the true history of the part of the world they call Canada.
How many people know that "Canada" is derived from the Kanienkehaka word,
Kanata, which means village?

No doubt, this list was intended to help Canadians be aware, and
sensitive, of our cultures and traditional ways. It fails miserably,
however, as is demonstrated by the reaction of one Aboriginal person to
whom I sent the materials:

"Earlier today I started to get that queasy feeling when I saw smudges,
prayers, and potlatching listed as 'lunchtime activities' that could be
squeezed in somehow between word processing or board meetings or whatever.
This little laundry list is so fundamentally disrespectful that only a
person who was totally ignorant of the significance of some of these
activities could have put this list together... maybe I AM offended after
all..."

There's no justice in National Aboriginal Day and our people will have
little to celebrate until justice is done. I can say this given your
government's track record in dealing with our people. This is just as
self-serving and self-legitimizing as all federal and provincial
government's policies on "Aboriginal" issues.

I also find it particularly ironic that Indian Affairs would close out
their list of activities with the following cautionary note:

"It is highly recommended that, in planning events, you involve a person
knowledgeable in Aboriginal traditions."

Maybe taking their own advice, and having Aboriginal people offer what
would -- and wouldn't -- be appropriate, would have been one step away
from tokenism.

Comments from NativeNet listowner, Gary Trujillo (gst@gnosys.svle.ma.us):

One wonders whether Elijah Harper, respected Aboriginal leader and Member of
the Legislative Assembly in Manitoba (I don't know if he is still serving in
this capacity), who is mentioned in the proclamation, approved of this list
of suggestions.

I am hopeful that before long it will be possible to set up Web-based forums
to discuss issues such as this one and to assemble information that might
become the basis of proposals of better methods for bringing about the kind
of reconciliation that observances like the ones accompanying the proclama-
tion would seem aimed at producing.  Also, the sorts of values and way of
life that Allen describes as those of his people and other Aboriginal peoples
is not necessarily unavailable to members of non-Aboriginal societies, but
it is unlikely (and risks giving severe insult) that fundamental changes in
the way that people think, live, and act in North American society is to be
effected through superficial simulations of Native customs and ceremonies.

I would like to think about ways in which NativeNet can become a vehicle
for bringing about the kinds of examinations that might begin, or at least
be part, of a process through which people all over the world look at the
dominant modes of activity and the moral and intellectual underpinnings of
that activity.  It feels as if the kind of dialogue between Native and non-
Native persons and societies that can be most productive is one premised
on a recognition by members of the non-Native societies of the way in which
they have been responsible for a great deal of damage and destruction, both
to Native people and ways of life and to the earth as a whole.  Only through
acknowledging the historical and ongoing reality of these patterns, I feel,
do we have a chance of attempting the healing that so many of us really want.

Gestures such as those described in this proclamation may well amount to
tokenism - but there may be some genuine compassion that lie behind them,
despite the clumsiness implicit in the way they are formulated and promul-
gated.  Perhaps the mere fact that attempts toward reconciliation are being
made should be taken as a hopeful sign (despite the fact that they occur
within a larger pattern within which Aboriginal people across Canada continue
to feel the burden of what many feel to be unfair and possibly systematically
abusive treatment, as expressed in law, policy, and public attitude).  Maybe
a time is coming when a more genuine, meaningful, and productive dialogue
can come about.  Through our efforts, we may be able to help initiate and
encourage that process that I feel offers rich rewards for all of us.  To
begin that process, we will need to educate ourselves so as to really under-
stand and acknowledge historical and contemporary reality and to do what we
can to alter that part of the reality that we can affect.  By looking at our
institutions:  governmental, corporate, educational, religious, etc., etc.,
and how they can be humanized in keeping with the kind of spirit that Allen
talks about as being that which has guided his people, and learning such
things as being able to do more with less, there is much we can do to prepare
the ground for new growth.  (My apologies for using language that may sound
overly-idealistic and possibly even vacuous - once we get into such an
exchange, and concrete proposals come forth, I think we will see that there
is much in the way of ordinary practical work to be done - and that this
is much in the way of ordinary practical work to be done - and that this
effort need not be well-intentioned but ultimately worthless.)

I look forward to starting this process, and will do what I can to help
make it a reality.

Title: ENVIRONMENT: Arctic Nations Coordinate Fight Against Pollution

by Barbara Borst

TORONTO, Jun 27 (IPS) - The Arctic wilderness still looks
pristine, but pollution accumulating in the sea, ice, atmosphere,
and food chain threatens the health of humans and animals.

The end of the Cold War was seen as an opportunity to tackle
serious environmental problems in what had been an area of
confrontation. But, to date, these cooperative efforts have been
lacking an important voice -- that of the people who have
inhabited the region for millennia.

Government officials, environmental activists and aboriginal
groups look to remedy the situation with the establishment of the
Arctic Council.

Set to be in place by next fall, the Arctic Council will seek
to strike a balance between protecting flora and fauna and
answering the development needs of indigenous peoples.

The region has been contaminated with everything from
pesticides that have drifted from the tropics to nuclear wastes
dumped in the Arctic Ocean.  Holes in the ozone layer, persistent
contamination found in mother's milk and heavy metals in Russian
rivers warn of greater problems to come.

The eight Arctic states -- Canada, the United States, Russia,
Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Denmark (Greenland) -- signed
declarations a series of declarations, beginning in 1991, under
which they agreed to coordinate research and policy, prevention
and clean up.

Those governments, plus three organisations of indigenous
people, plan to carry these initial efforts further by
establishing the Arctic Council.

Mary Simon, Canada's Ambassador for Circumpolar Affairs, said
the council should do what the earlier declarations did not --
balance environmental protection with local development needs.

''We want not only to provide protection of the environment but
also new opportunities for people of the North,'' she said, noting
that when local resources are exploited indigenous people are
usually given only menial jobs. ''Our young people are desperate
for work.''

There is a ''critical link'' between the environment and the
region's social, cultural and economic viability, said Simon,
former president of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference.

(The ICC, the Saami Council, which represents indigenous people
in Scandinavia, and the Russian Association of Peoples of the
North will be permanent council participants.)

Alan Saunders of the Canadian Polar Commission, a federal
agency, said native people have ''a very strong voice'' in North
America, but that most European states ''have a little more Old
World view - science through the academies.''

The 1991 declaration by the Arctic states established the
Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS) and the Arctic
Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP), which focuses on
persistent organic contaminants, heavy metals, radioactivity,
acidification and Arctic haze.

Major AMAP reports on the state of the Arctic will be delivered
next year. Terry Fenge, executive director of the Canadian Arctic
Resources Council, promised that his and other environmental
groups will not allow them to be shelved.

''The AEPS really is a network of fax and e-mail primarily
among civil servants,'' Fenge said. ''It's fine, important, but
the major step has yet to be taken from information exchange to
collective action.

''The rubber hits the road next year when the reports are
published,'' Fenge said.

The Arctic Council, Fenge noted, will bring together senior
politicians who can have an impact that the voluntary efforts to
date have failed to produce.

''We probably know less about the Arctic than any other
region,'' noted Saunders.

''Yet there are reasons to know more. It makes such a
difference to northern climate,'' he added. ''It's a fairly
sensitive environment up there and takes a long time to recover.''

The environmental degradation in the Arctic was exacerbated by
the Cold War, during which the Soviets conducted 90 atmospheric
and 42 underground nuclear tests at Novaya Zemlya, in the Arctic.

Additionally, there were more than 20 naval accidents involving
nuclear-powered or -armed warships or submarines in the region and
a Russian commission determined that at least 16 nuclear reactors
from submarines and 2.5 million curies of radioactive waste were
dumped into the Arctic Ocean.

Cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) leaked at
Western military installations in the Arctic. Canadian government
studies during the 1980s showed PCB concentrations in the breast
milk of Inuit women in northern Quebec to be five times as high as
in Caucasian women of southern Canada.

Because PCBs are stored in body fat, thus increasing in
concentration as one ascends the food chain, they pose a
particular threat to indigenous peoples, who live off fish and
mammals.

Chester Reimer of the ICC said the Arctic Council also will have
to take actions that have an impact far beyond the region because
much of the pollution originates in other climes.

Chemicals spewed into the water and air from agricultural and
industrial production often evaporate and are carried by winds to
the Arctic, where they condense at colder temperatures, polluting
rivers, oceans and ice.

Reimer illustrated the difficulty of addressing this problem,
by noting that some international agencies that seek to protect
the Arctic environment, also promote the use of DDT pesticide to
fight malaria in the tropics.

''The Arctic Council's work could go well beyond the boundaries
of the region to look where the source [of pollution] is,'' she
said.

However,  Fenge reminds Arctic nations that they themselves are
responsible for the considerable pollution that results from
mining and petroleum production.

The Canadian Polar Commission's Saunders pointed out that budget
cuts in Canada and elsewhere threaten environmental research and
remediation. He added that these efforts are also thwarted by
lingering security concerns in Russia and the United
States.(end/ips/bb/pz/96)

[ Though it has become the general policy for the NATIVE-L list not to

It is imperative that people understand that this agreement to suspend came
only after the Nuu-chah-nulth Central Region objected to and requested that
the blockade be taken down.  The Central Region felt that there was a
blatant breach of protocol that has been in existence since the blockades of
1993.

Basically, the protocol dictates that prior to any activities such as a
blockade in our traditional territories, the group or groups are required to
first meet with the Central Region First Nations to discuss the actions and
a decision over whether or not our support or permission would be granted.
This was not followed, thus the Region felt compelled to ask that the
blockade be taken down.

> Our position has not changed from that which led to the setting up of
> the blockades and we must be ready to resume them at any time.

This statement is a primary example of why we are extemely concerned with
the manner in which groups take great latitude with our gestures of "good
will."  We take offense to this statement as it becomes clearer that there
is no intention of entering into our meeting of July 6, 1996 with an
"openness" and "willingness" to work with other groups to find real
solutions.  This makes it clear that they have one agenda and only one and
we find it reprehensible that this attitude will be taken into our meeting.

> We need your help for this. Let us known if you could support the
> resumption of the blockades.

This is totally irresponsible as the group is calling upon reinforcements
prior to giving the process (meeting of July 6, 1996) a fair and honest
opportunity to prove that it can work.  We issue a further challenge to
those who have received the original mail that you give First Nations an
opportunity to do our job as "facilitators" to get people to work together
to find solutions to the issues that reignited the blockade.

IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE READER UNDERSTAND THAT THIS STATEMENT WAS
FILED AND SENT BY THE GROUPS AND IS NOT AN ACCURATE REFLECTION NOR SHOULD IT
BE MISINTERPRETED AS HAVING REPRESENTED THE CENTRAL REGION FIRST NATIONS.
WE ACCEPT AND TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS STATEMENT!!!!! BUT WE OFFER
OUR PERSPECTIVES TO SOME OF THE
STATEMENTS MADE.

Indeed, this comes one year after the Government's adoption of the report
but based upon our involvement we have seen many efforts taken by the
Central Region First Nations, Government and Industry to give effect to
those recommendations despite the fact that they are yet to be declared
(via legislation) into law.

It is the objective of the Central Region First Nations to get the various
groups to generate their energies to solution building on how the
implementation can be fast tracked.  That is the purpose and objective of
the July 6, 1996 meeting.  There are processes already underway that have
taken government people at least six months to a year to develop on an
implementation strategy for the Science Panel requirements.  As a matter of
fact, our First Nations, through the Clayoquot Sound Central Region Board
instigated this initiative shortly after the Government's announcement on
the acceptance by "drafting" an implementation plan and the Government's
response to this has been the work done for the past year.  In addition, we
have committed ourselves to participate in the Planning Framework process
established by Government to give effect to the Scientific Panel requirements
and it is through there we will push to have significant change to the manner
in which companies carry on business.

These band-aid solutions?  What are they?  It would be interesting to see
what it is that the group considers band-aid solutions!  What solutions have
the groups themselves submitted that could contribute to the process of
solution building?  That is the challenge issued to all groups for the
meeting of July 6, 1996.  If the efforts that have been taken over the past
are considered band-aid, then we look forward to the group's contribution
on what they consider "concrete" solutions.  Quite evident is the perception
that the efforts we and many others have taken are looked upon only as
"band-aid" solutions, thus, the meeting of July 6, 1996 should be very
productive in that the group(s) will put forward "concrete" solutions.

Again, this an identified objective of the meeting of July 6, 1996 and that
is "how are we going to manage pristine watersheds."  We feel that there is
a general common principle amongst all groups that no pristine watersheds
should be accessed without having completed a thorough inventory and
evaluated that inventory that would assist in the management.  It is
imperative that this process of identifying "how" we can do this on July 6,
1996 be given a fair opportunity to prove itself before condemning it.  We
know that we can spend alot of time and energy spinning our wheels over
"definition" of pristine, but that is not necessarily the objective of July
6, 1996.  We will focus in on how we will manage the pristine watersheds.

Absolutely, if we all got our priorities straight then we would collectively
work together to find workable solutions to giving effect to the Science
Panel requirements but unfortunately that is not how the world turns is it?
It really is unfortunate that we spend a lot of energy debating over first of
all "whether or not the Science Panel was asked the right question" then now
we spend alot of time debating over "definitions and interpretations."  It
is time to get on with the work of developing effective implementation plans
that put into action the Science Panel requirements and that again is the
challenge we all must face beginning July 6, 1996.  On July 6, 1996 all our
priorities must be straight, we must leave our own personal agendas out the
door so that we can begin the process of solution building!

How is reducing the cut in Clayoquot Sound from 900,000 cubic metres
annually to just over 100,000 cubic metres scandalous?  How is reducing the
workforce in Clayoquot Sound from 175 crewpersons to 17 scandalous?  All of
this within the past three years since the infamous blockades of 1993!

How is the implementation of the Clayoquot Sound Central Region Board and
its decision making powers scandalous?  How is it scandalous that First
Nations have a direct say in the overall management of all resources within
Clayoquot Sound through the Clayoquot Sound Central Region Board scandalous?
How is it scandalous that companies are now paying attention to and giving
adequate protection for First Nations interests in all aspects of forest
management?  How is it scandalous that the Government provided the Clayoquot
Sound Central Region Board and the Central Region First Nations the
opportunity for the first time to amend the Tree Farm License Agreement with
M & B?  How is it scandalous that the Government not just once but twice
signed an Interim Measures Agreement with the Central Region First Nations
giving protection to the First Nations interests until a modern day treaty
has been negotiated?

How is it scandalous that the companies have agreed to set aside specific
blocks out of their Tree Farm License for a symposium on alternative
silviculture systems proposed by panelists recommended from all groups
(including environment groups)?  How is it scandalous that out of that
symposium Catherine Mater of Mater Engineering has been approached to
contract her services for these sites?  How is it scandalous that Dean Berg
(presentor) has also been approached to do work on the engineering of the
symposium sites that would implement the alternative silvicultural system
proposed by his company?  How is it scandalous that the companies have
agreed with the First Nations to conduct a complete inventory throughout all
of Clayoquot Sound on Culturally Modified Trees, medicinal plants and sacred
sites?

Naturally all of the above are just a small sample of initiative that the
Central Region First Nations have been involved in.  They are small steps
but they are steps indeed being taken to give change to the manner in which
companies think and how they carry out business in Clayoquot Sound.  People
must appreciate, all of the above are samples of "change" and are easy for
us to measure because we come from a position of where we had no involvement
period.  For others who have had the ability to affect change and be involved
in processes that bring about change then of course we can understand why it
is more difficult for you to see that things are changing.

Granted it may not be at the pace some people desire but we all fall within
that frustration!  We have watched the groups move at a "snail's pace" to
come into the process and work with government, companies and labour to
implement changes!  We are still waiting for the groups to sit under one
roof and hold a productive discussion on how business can move ahead.  We,
as First Nations, have waited tirelessly for the governments to negotiate a
process that would make us feel included and that we were being taken
seriously!  We have that process now through our IMA and through the Central
Region Board!  It is not perfect and there are times it is not moving to our
satisfaction but instead of barking over the "snail's pace," we have chosen
to work with our Board to initiate changes.  It is happening and we will
continue to function in that capacity.

WHAT IS PEACE BRIGADES INTERNATIONAL?

Peace Brigades International (PBI) is a non-partisan international 
organization committed to practicing nonviolence in conflict areas. 
PBI volunteers, by providing support and accompaniment, create 
"breathing space"  for groups working nonviolently for social justice.
PBI volunteers respond to requests for protective accompaniment from
individuals and groups threatened with political violence, facilitate 
workshops upon request, and disseminate first-hand reports 
internationally.

WHO CAN BE A PBI VOLUNTEER? 

PBI volunteers come from many countries, backgrounds and philosophical 
perspectives.  They share a strong commitment to nonviolence and a belief 
in the power of local people to create more peaceful and just societies.  
PBI seeks volunteers age 25 and older.  Volunteers must be able to commit 
to a minimum of  7 months of service (excepting North America Project).  
Spanish fluency required for Guatemala and Colombia.  French for Haiti.  
Volunteers must complete a detailed application, with references, followed 
by a telephone interview before being accepted for the training session.  

WHAT DO OUR PEACE TEAMS DO IN THE FIELD?

GUATEMALA:
PBI has accompanied Nobel Prize winner Rigoberta Menchz,  families of the
disappeared (GAM and FAMDEGUA),  rural campesino groups (CERJ, CUC, CONIC, 
CCDA and others)  labor unions (dozens!), returning refugees, Communities 
of Population in Resistance, widows groups (CONAVIGUA), internally 
displaced (CONDEG and others),  and many others.  PBI also offers 
workshops on demand in Peace Education. (volunteers must be fluent in 
Spanish.)

SRI LANKA
PBI provides protective accompaniment for individuals and an international

The   International   Secretariat   of  OMCT/SOS-Torture   requests   your
intervention in the following situation in India

Brief description of the situation:
CVICT,  a member of the network, reported the situation faced by a  number
of  Bhutanese  refugees who were on a peace march to  Thimpu,  Bhutan,  to
appeal  to  the  King to resolve the Bhutanese refugee problem  through  a
process of national reconciliation.

The  original  150 peace marchers were detained in India in  January.  The
Siliguri  court, in India, declared their detention illegal  and  released
them on the 27 February. The court then ordered the release of another 273
marchers  who  were released on 28 February. The ruling  stated  that  the
imposition  was  illegal and that under the Bhutan Friendship  Treaty  the
Bhutanese  citizens had the full freedom of movement on Indian  territory.
At   that  time  a  further  344  Bhutanese  refugees  remained  in   Jail
(Bahrampur).

On  the  12  March,  a further 183 Refugees were arrested,  crossing  into
India.
On  the 19 of March 188 peace marchers were stopped and arrested violently
on  31  National highway Saheed Nagar, Siliguri, West Bengal The  marchers
are  still  being  detained in Jalpaiguri jail where  the  conditions  are
extremely poor and overcrowded.

The  Calcutta high court upheld the decision of the Jalpaiguri Courts that
stated  that all the peace marchers would have to sign a personal  release
bond  if they wished to be released.The bond, in effect, is a promise  not
to  disturb  the  peace  or  violate and  Indian  Law,  whilst  on  Indian
Terrirtory.

New Information:
On 12 June at 2PM, One of the peace marchers, Mr Babu Ram Shengden
detained in Barhampur Jail, died in Barhampur Sadar Hospital(West Bengal).
He was arrested on March 28 1996,.

His condition was poor when he was arrested and his health deteriorated
rapidly, despite frequent requests for appropriate medical attention. Only
in early June did Jail medical staff investigate and diagnosed TB.
Although given medicine, he did not recieve appropriate treatment. On the
11th June he was brought to Barhampur Civil Hospital, where he died.

OMCT has repeatedly warned of the consequences of the poor conditions in
the prison on the physical and psychological integrity of the marchers.
The current number of peace marchers currently detained is 896.(Due to
further arrests)

Action Requested
Please write to the Indian Authorities urging them to:

   A. RICE, LAND DISPUTES AND NEW REFUGEES
   B. LACK OF INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION.....

2. COMPASSION AND COLLUSION...

3. RECOMENDATIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY


**************************************




1. MNRC MAY 1996 REPORT


"But the manners of Thai authorities in
driving out the suffering farmers and
confiscating land are inhumane and
maltreatment of a weak community." 


A. RICE PLANTATION, LAND DISPUTE AND NEW ARRIVALS 

Since January, the MNRC and the Mon Resettlement  Committee which was
formed with mostly New MonState Party (NMSP) members from concerned 
District Administrative Body, have encouraged the refugees to prepare 
for rice plantation in this rainy season. To facilitate for smooth 
plantation process, that NMSP's committee hasarranged sharing land 
to the refugees who planned for growing rice, and the MNRC and the 
donor organization, Burmese Border Consortium, provided available tools 
such as machete, grass scythe, hoe, axe, saw, file and whetstone for 
them. The method of rice plantation in the mountainous area is
normally slash and burnt. 

According to registers received by MNRC from respective sites, 
there were 259 families from Halockhani, 143 families from Be Ree 
and only 91 families from Tavoy Area registered to grow rice and
then, when MNRC distribute rice seeds to those farmers, it was noted 
that 29 families from Halckhani and 5 families from Bee Ree have 
failed to grow. They explained that because of land soil they changed 
for other crops instead of rice, such as chilly and vegetables,
and some said they failed to grow because they have been delayed for
preparation time. Even when the MNRC and Mon Resettlement Committee have 
encouraged the refugees to grow rice, the rebuilding of houses and 
other needed structures in the camps  has taken time and only few
percent of the population has been able to grow rice. 

Furthermore, the number of farmer families has been reduced for 
several reasons; a land dispute on the borderline area, by the Halo-
ckhani camp ocurred between Mon refugee farmers nd Thai autorities.
For decades the land by the borderline at the Three Pagoda Pass has
remained an area of complicated ownership for Thai and Burmeses people.
Since 1991 the Mon refugees have been constantly forced to relocatedue to the land disputes in this area. The current land dispute area
is the so called " Baleh Hanook" where  a few hundred Mon refugees were
located at Loh Loe in 1991. The Thai autorities were afraid that if
the Mon remained fr a longer time the Burmeses autorities would
reclaim the land as part of Burma. For that reason the Mon refugees
have been forced to move from place to place.

Following the land dispute the Thai autorities, including armyand
border police, drove about 50 Mon refugee farmers from that area and
also confiscated their tools given to them by donor organizations.
Fears of Tai autorities have produced the forced relocations of the
Mon refugees since 1991. After the refugees were attacked by Burmeses
troops in July 1994 Thai autorities did not allow the refugees to re-
turn to Thai soil. Te refugees were forced by the Thai army to return
to the dangerous camp. Even temporary shelters for the refugees were
rejected by Thai autorities on Thai soil and on the borderline of
Three Pagoda Pass area. 

Mon refugee armers and the NMSP local autorities claimed that the 
area under discussion belonged to Burma and that they so have right
to grow rice. Thai autorities did not agree and said  the Mon were
acting out orders of the Burmeses rgime, after all NMSP had made
a cease-fire agreement with SLORC. Anyhow, that is not the case
the land dispute is an issue to be agreed between the two governments.
But the manners of Thai autorities, in diving out the sufferin
farmers and confiscating land, are inhumane and a maltretment to a
weak community.

At the same time when the Mon farmers were forced to abandon their
rice plantations, not recieving protection from anybody, new arrivas
from several local Mon villages have arrived looking after a safe 
haven in Halockhani camp. After the confiscation of their mountai-
neous rice plantations they have no right to clear grass and reap
crops there. Because of the rduction of farmer numbers and land
confiscation the rice products in coming dry season must be re-
duced.


According to the reports sent by respetive camp committees 45 
families have taken refuge at Halockhani camp in May while 40
families arrived to Tavoy area. They already registered to be camp
residents. Their reasons to abandon their native home and flee to
the refugee camps are very similar. The native places of origin
of the Halockhani new arrivals are in the villages of the Ye
township in the Mon State, Yebyu township of Tenasserim Division
and Kya Inn Seik Kyi of Karen State. The new arrivals of Tavoy
Area come mostly from their home villages of Yebyu township.

According to interviews conducted by MNRC, most of them escaped
the human rights abuses committed by SLORC local troops such as 
conscription to forced labour  and porters and collection of
various kinds of tax in their villages of origin.  

 Besides such kinds of abuses,the torturing of villagers is still
occurring in local areas, as the Burmese soldiers never abandoned
their previous bad behaviour towards the people. The most terrible 
area is Tenasserim Division where the military government is im- 
plementing several infrastructure projects such as Ye-Tavoy railway 
and gas pipe-line. 

For the moment, the MNRC already completed transportation process 
of all supplies to all of its  camps to stock-pile in rainy season.
Third week of May the rainy season started and at the present it 
might be difficult to transport rice to Halockhani and impossible 
to Tavoy Area because all the roads used for transportation have
collapsed. Therefore the MNRC can not transport more supplies for
those new arrivals and the stock-piling assistance in the camps
shall not cover the needs of the refugees to the end of the year.



B. LACK OF INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION TO BURMA4S ETHNIC REFUGEES.


Compared with other refugees in the world, Cambodians, Kurds and
Afgans who had to leave their countries of origin due to human 
rights violations , the ethnic refugees of Burma have recieved no
international protection. The Burmese refugees, having the same
stories as other world refugees, forced by the civil war, perse-
cution, ethnic discrimination and other abuses have sought for
safe haven in Thailand as a country of asylum. Thailand, on the
other hand, has never welcome a well organized international
protection of Burmese refugees, contrarily of the principles
they have accepted on the Thai-Cambodia border.

Since the Burma4s ethnic refugees have been denied international
protection decisions to improve living conditions and security of
refugees must be made by the community itself together with the
political party holding arms and having fought for self determi-
nation. Such a protection, when facing government preassure is
however too fragile.  Community leaders and community organization
can not prevent the terrible consequences to the people. The 
refugees became pawns in political games and or economic struggle
of governments and profits. Terrible situations, forced relocation,
repatriation, threats for cutting supplies, blockage of roads for
transportation are means the autorities use putting the tolerance
of the refugees to a hard test.

In case of CROSS-BORDER RELOCATION of the Mon refugees there has
been some critic to the Mon community leaders, MNRC and NMSP as
making the relocation of the refugees without their consent and
so participating in "involuntary repatriation" or "forced repat-
riation". For MNRC the recent development was a "community orga-
nized relocation"  but we are not satisfied that such a relocation 
lacked the organization and presence of the international commu-
nity and the principles adopted by by United Nations were ignored.

Other Burmeses refugees living under similar conditions have also
suffered the preassure and felt the absence of the international
protection. The Kachin refugees, taking refuge along the Chinese 
border, neither recieved international protection nor assistance
for survival. For that reason the Kachin refugee community is the
most isolated one of all the refugees from Burma.

Mon,Karen,Karenni and Shan refugees of Thai-Burma border have re-
cieved available assistance for survival but their safety has
allways been in danger and  several times the supplies were blocked 
to transport due to the preassure of Thai autorities. The interna-
tional protection is reluctant and possible safety was never pro-
vided by the country of asylum. Particularly Mon and Karen refugees
have been attacked by Burmese troops and refugees were arrested,
detained, killed and kidnapped. Because of such experiences the
refugees always feel very unsafe everywere even in Thailand.

The first suffering of the refugees was under the inhumane military
dictatorship, the second suffering they experienced on the border
camps where they expected to have safety. The practical internatio-
nal protection is still reluctant and no organization is able to
relieve this suffering. The international attention was present 
only in "hard situations" , forcefull migrations, military attacks
and flagrant violations. After the situation the international 
attention disappears and the refugees continue suffering.

The situation of Burma4s ethnic refugees has no international
protection, Burma, the country of origin offers no productive
situation for the repatriation. UNTIL THE TIME IS REACHED FOR
REPATRIATION THE REFUGEES STILL NEED THE INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION
AS PROVIDED TO REFUGEES IN OTHER COUNTRIES OF ASYLUM ACCORDING
TO INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION LAW ON REFUGEES.

3. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.


( From Compassion and Collusion.... p.28 )




A. Governments, international organizations, NGO4s and humanitarian
   groups should press for a repatriation which meets accepted inter-
   national standards for protection and assistance, garanteed by the
   governments involved, and should provide adequate funding and
   assistance to implement it.

B. Mon refugees should be formally recognized as refugees by the
   Thai government, and their legal options should be a matter of 
   public record.

C. The Thai government should autorize and facilitate UNHCR4s exercise
   of its internationsl mandate for protection, assistance and 
   durable solutions for Mon refugees.

D. The Thai government should allow unencumbered access to the BBC
   delivering assistance to the Mon before their repatriation, and
   should allow access to these areas at least until the end of 1996.

E. The Thai government should enact legislation recognizing refugees
   and the right of asylum.

F. UNHCR should continue to request the Burmese government to show
   good will by allowing fulla and free monitoring of Mon returnees.

G. The Thai and Burmese governments should as a matter of humanitarian
   intrest, extend the timetable for repatriation until the viability
   of integration is ensured.

H. The Burmese government should publicly accept its obligation to
   protect Mon returnees as citizens of Burma, free of harassment or
   human rights violations.

I. UNHCR or other recognized international organization should be
   given frequent and full access to the returnees. This monitoring
   should be from the Thai side if that is the only logistical way
   to ensure quality monitoring.

J. The Burmese and the Thai governments should allow cross-border
   reintegration assistance from the Thai side of the border until 
   such assistance is available from inside Burma.

K. As a show of good will, the cease fires should be followed up 
   with full peace negotiations.

L. Since UNHCR has a recognized international mandate to protect
   refugees, it should encourage to publicly comment on the Mon
   repatriation, or be held accountable when its silence communi-
   cates support for the status quo.

M. Embassy4s and other organizations should participate in this
   attempt to protect Mon returnees.

N. International organizations and embassies should consider their
   role in the repatriation and ensure adequate guarantees of access
   and monitoring  before financing a repatriation program.

Case IND 230196.9
Ninth Follow up of
Case IND 230196

The International Secretariat of OMCT/SOS-Torture requests your intervention 
in the following situation in India.

Brief description of the situation:

CVICT, a member of the network, reported the situation faced by a number of 
Bhutanese refugees who were on a peace march to Thimpu, Bhutan, to appeal to 
the King to resolve the Bhutanese refugee problem through a process of 
national reconciliation.

The original 150 peace marchers were detained in India in January. The 
Siliguri court, in India, declared their detention illegal and released them 
on the 27 February. The court then ordered the release of another 273 
marchers who were released on 28 February. The ruling stated that the 
imposition was illegal and that under the Bhutan Friendship Treaty the 
Bhutanese citizens had the full freedom of movement on Indian territory. At 
that time a further 344 Bhutanese refugees remained in Jail (Bahrampur).

On the 12 March, a further 183 Refugees were arrested, crossing into India. 
On the 19 of March, 188 peace marchers were stopped and arrested violently on 
31 National highway Saheed Nagar, Siliguri, West Bengal The marchers are 
still being detained in Jalpaiguri jail where the conditions are extremely 
poor and overcrowded.

The Calcutta high court upheld the decision of the Jalpaiguri Courts that 
stated that all the peace marchers would have to sign a personal release bond 
if they wished to be released. The bond, in effect, is a promise not to 
disturb the peace or violate any Indian Law, whilst on Indian Territory.

On 12 June 1996, Mr Babu Ram Shengden, a peace marcher who was detained in 
Barhampur Jail, died in Barhampur Sadar Hospital.  He had been arrested 28 
March 1996.  He had been in poor health before he was arrested, but the 
Indian authorities had failed to give him appropriate medical attention.  He 
had been put in the hospital on 11 June 1996.

Also on 12 June 1996, a further 50 Bhutanese peace marchers were arrested in 
Hasimara, near the Bhutanese border.  They are currently being detained in 
Alipurduar Jail.

On 19 June 1996, Indian police lathi charged 300 Bhutanese refugees marching 
in the funeral procession of Babu Ram Shengden to Bhutan.  One hundred people 
were injured.  In the end, the Bhutanese refugees were forced to flee, 
leaving the coffin behind. 

New Information:

On 19 June 1996, police removed the coffin of Babu Ram Shengden from 
Mahananda bridge and took it to an undisclosed location.

On 24 June 1996, a further 50 Bhutanese peace marchers, led by Balaram 
Subedl, were arrested in Gathia, on National Highway 31, in the Jalpaiguri 
district of West Bengal.  They had marched 7km from Luksan Bazaar and were

                        ACTION ALERT
May 27, 1996
As of this writing the impasse between the Zapatista Army of
National Liberation (EZLN) and the Mexican government
remains unresolved.  The recent sentence of two "alleged"
members of the EZLN to long prison terms with no significant
evidence against them and a complete lack of due process has
caused the EZLN to declare the "impossibility" of a
continuance of the peace talks.
Because these political prisoners are literally hostages of
the peace process the National Commission for Democracy, USA
has declared the need for a national campaign for their
liberation. Until such liberation occurs, the Mexican
government will continue to utilize them to extort
concessions at the negotiating table and/or use their
imprisonment against accountability to any agreements.  The
EZLN has also called upon the Mexican government to take
some definitive action against the para-military groups and
"death" squads which are openly operating in the state of
Chiapas.
The present impasse in combination with a widespread famine
due to the inability of indigenous communities to lay in
crops, present the same crisis as existed in February 9th of
1995, and December of 1994.
We therefore call upon all interested individuals and
organizations to aid us in increasing international pressure
upon the Mexican government by collaborating with us in a
Campaign for the Liberation of the Political Prisoners.
Although there exists some possibility the impasse may be
resolved this week, it is our belief that an international
campaign calling for the freedom of these prisoners has
become a primordial need.  We therefore will carry out this
Campaign regardless of the outcome of this present crisis.
The campaign for the Liberation of these prisoners consists
of the following;
     1) We ask all concerned individuals to initiate the
campaign with a simultaneous
      press conference to be held June 3-5th.  A history of
the irregularities contained
      in their imprisonment can be obtained through the
National Center for Democracy, Liberty and Justice at this
address.

     2)  A letter-writing campaign to Warren Christopher at
the State Department will     be conducted throughout the
period of June 5 through July 1.  We call upon    people to
hold educationals about this issue and to otherwise
publicize in any way     possible the lack of human rights
in Mexico.  A sample of the letter to Christopher      is
included with this alert.  Please call upon prominent
national and local leaders    to add their voices to this
petition in order to demonstrate the concern for a continued
peace process.

     3)  The campaign will end on July 1 by culminating in a
    National Day of Reflection and Prayer.  We call upon
                    Churches, individuals
           committed to peace, and community leaders to
                participate in this Day in a
public demonstration of
     support for the liberation of these prisoners
and the end to paramilitary operations in Chiapas.

  Please contact the National Center for Democracy,
Liberty and Justice for
further information.  We hope you share our great
hope
for peace in Mexico and we urge you to do whatever you
can to demonstrate this hope by your participation in
this campaign.

Date: 28 May 1996 16:06:06


Update

     Recent news from Mexico indicates that Mexico's State
Department remains intransigent towards the EZLN.
Negotiator Marco Antonio Bernal stated today that:
     1) the federal gov't is not considering any "violent"
action
     2) the sentencing of the prisoners proceeds and the law
which governs the   peace is not a "straightjacket"
     3)the EZLN should bring any issues to the negotiating
table on June 5th or
     re-set a date.

     Meanwhile, in Veracruz, Francisco Garcia Santiago, a
presumed Zapatista, was found guilty and sentenced to 7
years in jail and a fine of $15,000 pesos.  Santiago was
sentenced based upon a confession obtained from him after
members of his family had been kidnapped by state police and
threats to their safety were used to obtain his confession.
He was sentenced for the sabotage of an electrical tower in
Veracruz.

JAILING THE TRUTH -HAITI, THE U.S. MILITARY, AND CONSCIENCE
AN EVENING OF INQUIRY WITH U.S. ARMY CAPT. LAWRENCE ROCKWOOD
 
 
PRESS RELEASE
 
Contact:
Buddhist Peace Fellowship
510/525-8596
Alan Senauke or Elsie Tep
 
 
"A real danger exists when a society is not willing to address military
issues.  Too often the false cloak of righteousness can be used to mask
what is really an indifference to the suffering of others."
                                                - Lawrence Rockwood
 
U.S. Army Captain Lawrence P. Rockwood is a military
counter-intelligence officer, court martialed in 1995 for following the
orders of his Commander in Chief, President Clinton, to establish peace
and safety in Haiti.  He will speak about his case, the U.S. presence
in Haiti and the forgotten legacy of My Lai and Vietnam at 7:30 PM on
Friday, June 7, at the Berkeley Unitarian Fellowship, at the corner of
Cedar and Bonita Streets  in Berkeley.  He will be joined by honored
guest Maclaine Lumas, an exiled teacher, Methodist activist with
Lavalas, and survivor of the Haitian jails.  Tickets are available at
Gaia Books in Berkeley, Walden Pond Bookstore in Oakland and also from
BPF at 510/525-8596 or EBSC at 510/540-5296.   Suggested donation -
$6-$10.
 
        In September, 1994, Capt.Rockwood obeyed the dictates of his
conscience, walking into a Haitian jail in Port-au-Prince to witness
the conditions for political prisoners held there.  For that action of
honor and concern he was court martialed and removed from active duty.
Lawrence Rockwood, a practicing Buddhist, is presently appealing his
court martial and speaking around the country.  His views challenge the
U.S. military and us as well.
 
        This event is sponsored by the Buddhist Peace Fellowship (BPF)
and the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant's (EBSC) Haiti Committee.
Co-sponsors include the International Action Center, the Bay Area
Haitian-American Council and the Ecumenical Peace Institute.  Proceeds
from the event will support the work of BPF and the EBSC's Material Aid
for Haiti Campaign.
 
 ***********
 
        In 1990, the Haitian people voted for a democracy headed by
Father Jean Bertrand Aristide.  In 1991, Aristide, Haiti's first
democratically-elected president, was ousted in a military coup dUetat
that killed over 4,000 people and forced tens of thousands more to flee
the country.  The Haitian people lived in constant fear of the death
squads of the Front Revolutionaire pour le Avancement et Progres
d'Haiti (FRAPH) who persecuted any who were suspected of supporting the
ideals of the Aristide government.  In September of 1994, U.S. troops
were sent to Haiti to provide a safe and secure environment for the
return of democracy. President Clinton stated the primary objective of
Operation Uphold Democracy was to stop the brutal atrocities that
threaten tens of thousands of Haitians.  Yet the refusal of the U.S.
military to release documentation of the atrocities committed by the
dictatorship and FRAPH and its unwillingness to hold them responsible
for their actions gives credence to the indifferent attitude that
compelled Rockwood to take action.
 
        Witnesses from the National Lawyers Guild have thoroughly
documented the reign of terror in Haiti.  Maclaine Lumas was a second
grade elementary school teacher at John Wesley Methodist School in
Jeremie.  She was active in the neighborhood committee which sponsored
adult literacy, reforestation and social education projects for the
betterment of the area.  She was also a member of Operation Populaire
Lavalas.  From February 1992 through August 1994, she was subjected to
a series of arrests, beatings, and death threats.  In fear for her
life, Maclaine was able to leave her homeland through the efforts of
Bay Area supporters.  A survivor of this systematic violence,
Lumas will share with us her experiences in Haiti as well as her dreams
and concerns for her country's future.

Date: 30 May 1996 20:32:43



-------------- Enclosure number 1 ----------------
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher
2201 C. St. NW
Washington, D.C.  20520



Dear Sir,

     We, the undersigned wish to express a high level of concern
about the growing crisis in Mexico and the real possibility of
the outbreak of hostilities once again in the southeast state of
Chiapas.  The growing evidence of human rights violations, links
to drug trafficking on a high governmental level, and the
continued impunity of paramilitary groups, have provoked a
massive exodus of families seeking relief from the political and
economic crisis.
     Because Mexico is our closest neighbor in Latin America we
cannot remain silent before the consequences of this crisis.  We
therefore request the response of the State Department in terms
of the following issues;

      1) We understand that Mexico is receiving substantial
military equipment  from the United States.  Although the
objective of these sales is said to be aid in the drug war, we
request information about the guarantees which exist that this
equipment will not be used for other purposes such as
counterinsurgency  and government responses to civil unrest.
This equipment includes the recent sale of 73 Huey helicopters.
We are also interested in clearly understanding the current
working relationships to both train the Mexican military and
replace any weapons ten years or older for the Mexican Army.
     2) We request any current information on the state of
human
rights in Mexico.  Specifically we need to know current
governmental responses to paramilitary groups and/or "deaths
quads", and to the protection of the human rights of the 18
individuals presently jailed under accusation of being members
of the rebel group in Chiapas, the Zapatistas.
     3)  We request any information which the State Department
may have about the possible breakdown of the peace talks in
Chiapas, Mexico.

     We strongly affirm our commitment to a peaceful solution
and a transition to democracy for Mexico.  We do not believe
that our southern border can bear the economic and humanitarian
brunt of a growing and debilitating political and economic
crisis in Mexico. We urge your prompt response and look forward
to policies which strengthen the possibilities for peace in
Mexico.  Thank you for your attention.

Respectfully,

Convocatoria a la Jornada Mundial en Apoyo al "Dialogo de
San Andres".

El "Dialogo de San Andres", por la paz con justicia y
dignidad,
este en peligro. El gobierno mexicano ha dado claras senales
de su
intencion de romperlo, para asi justificar una salida
militar. La carencia
de propuestas y el bajo perfil de la delegacion
gubernamental a lo largo
de la Mesa 2 dedicada al tema "Democracia y Justicia", las
condenas a
Javier Elorriaga y Sebastian Entzin, presuntos zapatistas,
por los cargos
de terrorismo, la ambigiedad del poder ejecutivo al plantear
la forma de
revertir dichas condenas y la informacion calumniosa que
filtra el
gobierno a ciertos periodistas encargados de difamar la
causa de los
presuntos zapatistas, son prueba del intencional sabotaje
gubernamental al
proceso de paz. Las constantes y cada vez mas agresivas
incursiones
militares, la compra de equipos belicos y la proteccion a
los grupos
paramilitares que actuan en el estado de Chiapas, confirman
la intencion
del gobierno mexicano de justificar el reinicio de los
enfrentamientos
militares. Mientras la guerra de baja intensidad pasa a una
nueva etapa,
el gobierno mexicano ha lanzado un ultimatum diciendo que si
el EZLN no
acude a las negociaciones el proximo cinco de junio
reanudara la
persecucion judicial contra los zapatistas, lo cual
significaria de hecho
reaunudar la guerra.

Frente a esta grave situacion, el Ejercito Zapatista de
Liberacion
Nacional, ha declarado enfaticamente que, al no existir
condiciones
politicas minimas es imposible la continuacion del dialogo.
Por ello, ha
manifestado a la sociedad civil que si piensa hacer algo
para impedir la
solucion militar: a debe hacerlo ya!, exigiendo al gobierno
mexicano tomar
en serio el "Dialogo de San Andres".

Ante este momento crucial, entre la guerra y la paz,
Asesores e
Invitados del EZLN en el "Dialogo de San Andres" convocan a
los ciudadanos
del mundo, partidarios de una salida pacifica, justa y digna
de la guerra
en Chiapas, a realizar la 1a Jornada Mundial en apoyo al
"Dialogo de San
Andres", para exigir al gobierno crear las condiciones
necesarias para
alcanzar la paz. La Jornada se iniciara el proximo sabado 8
de junio
y continuara durante toda esa semana. Consistira en
movilizaciones simultaneas
frente a las embajadas y consulados mexicanos en todo el
mundo y en
multiples movilizaciones en Mexico. Comprendera ademas del
envio
de cartas al Presidente Ernesto Zedillo, 271-1764 (Fax) y
al Secretario de la Defensa Nacional, General Enrique
Cervantes. 395-2935
(Fax). Las principales demandas de esta Jornada seran:

 - El retiro de las tropas del ejercito mexicano a sus
cuarteles, en
cumplimiento del articulo 129 de la Constitucion mexicana,
el cese del
acoso a las comunidades chiapanecas y el envio de alimentos
a las
poblaciones ubicadas en la zona de conflicto, ya que el
acoso militar les
impidio sembrar.
- Retirar, por improcedentes los cargos de terrorismo Javier
Elorriaga y
Sebastian Entzin, y en consecuencia liberarlos de la carcel,
lo mismo que
a los otros 16 presuntos zapatistas presos.
- El reinicio de las platicas de paz, con una clara y
demostrable
decision de resolver los problemas que dieron origen al
levantamiento del
1o de enero de 1994.

Como simbolo de la Jornada proponemos soltar pequenos
"globos
aerostaticos" con un mensaje al EZLN que diga "No estan
solos", evocando
los globos enviados al mundo por los comuneros de Paris para
llamar a
defender la esperanza.

     Mucho agracederemos su participacion en estas Jornadas,
por la
vida y en contra de los actos guerreros del gobierno
mexicano.

     ASESORES E INVITADOS DEL EJERCITO ZAPATISTA DE
LIBERACION NACIONAL EN EL DIALOGO DE SAN ANDRES.
-------------------------------

          Call to action

International Week of Support for the San Andres Peace Talks
in Mexico

The San Andres Peace Talks for peace with justice and
dignity are in danger
of breaking down.  The Mexican government has clearly shown
its intention to
subvert the Peace Talks and to impose a military 'solution'
on the Zapatistas.

The Mexican government has not acted in good faith during
the second round
of Peace Talks on Democracy and Justice.  It has lacked
proposals for the Round
Table discussions, and the official government delegation is
composed of low
level bureaucrats who lack authority to negotiate in the
discussions.
Furthermore, even as it pretends to negotiate issues of
democracy and justice,
the Mexican government has arrested and condemned two
supposed Zapatistas -
Javier Elorriaga and Sebastian Entzin - to 14 years of jail
for unsubstantiated
charges of terrorism.  Both executive indecision on
reviewing this case and
leaks of slanderous information on the case from the
government to some
journalists who spread disinformation about the Elorriaga
and Entzin case are
part of an intentional government campaign to delegitimize
the Zapatistas'
position.

Menacing signs of the Mexican government's intention to
renew military
confrontation abound; constant and increasingly aggressive
military incursions
in Chiapas, purchase of military hardware, and the
protection of paramilitary
groups active in Chiapas.  While the low intensity warfare
reaches new levels of
activity, the Mexican government has imposed an ultimatum on
the Zapatistas.  If
the EZLN does not respond to government demands by June 5,
it will resume
judicial persecution of all presumed Zapatistas.  This is a
clear sign of the
Mexican government's transgression of the Peace Process and
a resumption of
a state of war.

In front of this serious situation, the Zapatista Army of
National Liberation
has declared that without even a minimal political will on
the part of the
government, it is impossible to continue a dialogue.  The
EZLN has told civil
society that if we want to do something to impede a military
solution - WE
MUST DO IT NOW!  We, civil society, must demand that the
government get serious about the San Andres Peace Talks.

At this crucial moment, between war and peace, the Advisors
and Observers for
the EZLN in the San Andres Peace Talks call all the citizens
of the world
interested in a peaceful, just and dignified solution to the
war in Chiapas, to
participate in and promote a Week of Support for the San
Andres Peace
Talks to pressure the Mexican government to create the
conditions necessary to reach a negotiated peace.

The Week of Support will begin Saturday, June 8, with
simultaneous
demonstrations for peace in front of Mexican embassies and
consulates through out the world, and with many
demonstrations throughout Mexico.  It will include sending
letters to:
     President Ernesto Zedillo     fax: (525)  271- 1764
     General Enrique Cervantes, Minister of National
Defense, (525)395-2935.

The principal demands of this week of Support are:
1. Withdrawal of Mexican army troops from Chiapas
communities and the retreat of Mexican army troops into
their barracks in fulfillment of Article 129 of the
Mexican Constitution.
2. Cessation of military harassment of Chiapas communities
and the delivery
of food and grains to the people living in the zone of
conflict; military action in
the area restricted farmers and peasants from planting their
subsistence crops
for the year.
3. Withdraw the unsubstantiated charges of terrorism against
Javier Elorriaga
and Sebastian Entzin, and free them from jail along with the
other 16 political
prisoners.
4. Reestablish the Peace Talks, with a clear and
demonstrable will to resolve
the problems that are at the root of the uprising of January
1, 1994.

As a symbol of the Week of Support, we propose that
participants launch
balloons in the air with the message to the EZLN saying "You
are NOT alone".  This action is reminiscent of the balloons
sent into the world by the members of the
communes of Paris in a call to defend their hope for a
better future.

Many thanks for your participation in the Week of Support,
in support of
life and against acts of war of the Mexican government.

Mexico City,

Group of Advisors and Observers of the EZLN in the San
Andres Peace Talks

Aufruf zur Internationalen Aktion zur Unterstuetzung des
"San Andres Dialog=
es"

Der "San Andres Dialog", das Dialog fuer einen wuerdigen und
gerechten
Frieden in Chiapas ist gerade in grosser Gefahr. Die
mexikanische
Regierung hat klare Zeichenge geben, den Dialog abzubrechen,
um eine
militarische Intervention gerechtfertigen zu koen nen. Die
mangelden
Vorschlaege und das niedrige Niveau der Regierungsdelegation
in der 2.
Verhandlungsphase (zum Thema "Demokratie und Gerechtigkeit")
der
Friedensgesprechaer; die Gerichtlicheverurteilungen von
Javier Elorriaga
und Sebastian Entzin, angeb liche Zapatisten, unter dem
Vorwurf des
Terrorismus; die unklare Stellungnahme der Exekutive zu
einer moeglichen
Ruecknahme der Verurteilung und die verleumderische
Berichterstattung
ueber den Fall in der mexikanischen Presse, beweisen die
intentionierte
Sabotagehaltung verschiedener Kreise gegen den
Friedensprozess. Die
staendigen und immer aggressiveren militaerischen Eingriffe,
die
Anschaffung neuer kriegerischen Ausruestung und der Schutz
der
paramilitaerische Gruppen der Region, belegen die Absicht
der
mexikanischen Regierung, erneute militaerische Aktionen
rechtfertigen zu
wollen. Waehrend der low-intensity Krieg auf einer hoeheren
Stufe angeland
ist, hat die mexikanische Regierung gleichzeitig das
Ultimatum gestellt,
dass wenn den Vertreter des Za patistischen Heeres sich
nicht zu den
Verhandlungen am 5. Juli einfinden,werden die gerichtlichen
Verfolgung
gegen die Zapatisten weitergehen. Das wuerde die
Wiederaufnahme des
Krieges bedeuten.=20

Angesichts dieser schweren Lage, hat die Zapatisten hat
nachdruecklich
erklaert dass, dass der Dialog nicht fortgesetzt werden
kann, solange wenn
die politischen Bedingungen nicht gegeben sind. Deswegen hat
das Ezln
ge=E4usert dass, wenn die politisch int eressierte
Gesellschaft etwas
unternehmen will, um die militarische Loesung zu verhindern,
muss sie das
jetzt tun, und um die mexikanische Regierung zu dr=E4ngen,
den Dialog Ernst
zu nehmen.=20

In dieser Situation zwischen Krieg und Frieden, rufen die
Berater und
Gaeste des EZLN im "San Andres Dialog" den Teil der
Weltbevoelkerung, ,
der eine friedige, gerechtige und wuerdige Loesung in
Chiapas
befuerwortet, dazu auf, die Internationalen Aktione n in
Unterstuetzung
zum "Dialogo de San Andres" zu organisieren. Diese Aktion
begint am 8.
Juni, mit Demonstrationen vor den mexikanischen Botschaften
und Konsulaten
in aller Welt und gleichzeitig verschiedenen Demostrationen
in Mexiko. Es
ist sehr wichti g, dass ihr Briefaktionen an den Presidenten
Ernesto
Zedillo (fax 271-1764) und des Verteidigungsminister General
Enrique
Cervantes (fax 395-2935)startet. Unsere wichtigsten
Forderungen sind:=20

- Der Rucksueck der Mexikanischen Armee in ihre Kassernen,
gemaess Artikel
129 des mexikanischen Grundgesetzes; schluss mit der
Belaestigung der
Bevoelkerung von Chiapas; die Sendung von Naehrungsmitteln
zur fuer die
Zivilbevoelkerung in der Konfliktzone,
 in der aufgrund der militaerischen Besetzung nicht geset
werden konnte.=20
- Das Zuruecknahme der Gerichtlichenanklage des Terrorismus,
und die
Freilassung Javier Elorreagas und Sebastian Entzins, und
aller anderen 16
angeblichen Zapatististen.=20
- Das Wiederaufnahme der Friedensverhandlungen,
und einer klaren und glauwuerdige Entscheidung der Regierung
die Probleme,
die den Konflikt hevorgerufen haben, zu loesen.=20

Als Symbol der Aktion, schlagen wir vor, kleine Luftballons,
mit der
Aufschrift "Ihr seid nicht allein", fliegenzulassen (im
Gedaechtins an die
Pariser Kommune und deren Aufruf die Hoffnung nicht zu
verlieren)

Wir bedanken uns herztlich fuer eure Teilnahme an dieser
Aktion fuer das
Leben und gegen den kriegerischen Umtriebe der Regierung.=20

Two alleged Mexican rebels freed on appeal

     TUXTLA GUTIERREZ- A judge acting of an appeal freed two
alleged Zapatista rebels from jail Thursday, opening the way
for stalled peace talks between the guerrillas and the
government to resume.
     Superior Court Judge Enrique Duran quashed the long
jail sentences for terrorism and rebellion imposed by a
lower court and set the men free, Uriel Jarguin, under-
secretary for government in the southern state of Chiapas,
told Reuters.
     The alleged rebels, Javier Elorriaga and Sebastian
Entzin, were sentenced May 2 to jail terms of 13 and six
years respectively.
     The appeal judge in the Chiapas state capital of Tuxtla
Gutierrez, 500 miles southeast of Mexico City, upheld a two-
year sentence for arms offenses against Entzin but freed him
of bail because he had already spent 16 months in jail.
     The harshness of the original verdicts, reached on the
basis of a written statement from a witness who never
appeared in court despite six summonses, provoked an angry
reaction from the Zapatista leadership.
     Rebel leader Subcommander Marcos said from his jungle
hideout June 1 that the Zapatistas would not resume stalled
peace talks with the government until the two men were
freed.
     Plans for a fresh round of talks June 5 were put on
hold and newspaper columnists speculated that the rebels
might be forced back into violence unless the tension eased.
     Marcos accused hard-liners in President Zedillo's
administration of provoking confrontation with the rebels,
suggesting they had engineered the court sentences to
undermine the peace negotiations.
     The government insisted that the justice process was
completely independent of the peace process and denied that
either the initial sentence or the freeing on appeal were
the result of any political pressure from Mexico City.
     Elorriaga and Entzin allegedly took part in the
uprising by Mayan Indians in the southern Mexican state of
Chiapas, where Zapatista rebels launched their revolt for
democracy and indigenous rights in January 1994.
     The two men had been in jail since February 1995, when
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo launched a crackdown
against the rebel forces.
     Elorriaga, a television journalist who also had served
as a go-between between Zedillo and the Zapatista guerrilla
leader Subcommandante Marcos, denied ever belonging to the
proscribed guerrilla movement.

Subject: More on Julian Salazar Calero
Date: 14 Jun 1996 23:03:36

From: NY Transfer News Collective  nyt@blythe.org 


Via NY Transfer News Collective * All the News that Doesn't Fit

 From the WILTON [CT] BULLETIN, June 5, 1996

 Wiltonians, relatives show concern for Peruvian exile facing extradition
 
 by DAVID FRIEDMAN
 
 Play by the rules and only good things will happen.
 
 That was the game plan that Julian Salazar Calero carried with him when
 he emigrated to the United States in 1991. Now, relatives say that it
 may turn out to be Mr. Calero's undoing.
 
 A man who worked as a nurse's aide for an elderly Wilton couple and at
 odd jobs here and in Ridgefield, Mr. Calero, 46, is being held in the
 Metropolitan Correction Center, a maximum security federal prison in
 Manhattan. He faced extradition proceedings on the request of the
 Peruvian government.
 
 Officials in Peru claim that Mr. Calero has participated in the Shining
 Path, a revolutionary group. They have asked the U.S. government to send
 Mr. Calero back to Lima, where he faces charges of terrorism, murder and
 accessory to murder.
 
 Tough road ahead 
 
 Mr. Calero's attorneys said they doubt that their client will be granted
 bail in Friday's bond hearing. They said they will likely file an appeal
 in hopes that  a hearing on their client's political asylum application
 will precede any extradition hearing.
 
 Meanwhile, family members in Ridgefield, employers and friends are
 circulating a petition. The goal is to collect 5,000 signatures and send
 the petition to state and federal lawmakers in order to gain their
 support, said Magali Calero, Mr. Calero's 27-year-old niece. The two
 live in Ridgefield with Mr. Calero's sister, Lila C. Roesch.
 
 Secret Isn't safe 
 
 Immigration and Naturalization Service authorities apprehended Mr.
 Calero in the lobby of Manhattan's 26 Federal Plaza on May 30. According
 to his attorney, Katya Plotnik of the New York City law office of Bruno,
 Joseph and Bembi, Mr. Calero was scheduled to present his political
 asylum application before an immigration judge that day.
 
 Family members suspect that information was leaked to the Peruvian
 government in order to locate Mr. Calero during what they believed to be
 a confidential proceeding. But that is not their greatest fear.
 
 If Mr. Calero were to lose his extradition case, he would be tried in a
 Peruvian military court without due process. He would face a death
 sentence or life in imprisonment if convicted, Ms. Plotnik said.
 
 Assessing the situation
 
 "I don't know what to expect," Ms. Calero said, "but I do have very high
 hopes that we're going to win because I know my uncle is innocent and I
 know he wouldn't do anything like this. I still do believe in the
 justice (system) in the United States because it's better than in Peru."
 
 Others are less optimistic. Mr. Calero's brother-in-law, Hans Probst of
 Ridgefield, said he cannot understand why the U.S. officials would
 cooperate with the corrupt Peruvian government, which is led by
 President Alberto Fujimori. Peru's government will "shoot first and ask
 questions later," Mr. Probst said. Mr. Calero's family has witnessed the
 government's evil acts first hand.
 
 Ms. Plotnik said that military police tortured Mr. Calero's brother
 in-law, Roberto Calderon Garagate to death in September 1993. It May
 1994, Mr. Calero's wife Fresia Calderon Garagate was imprisoned in Peru.
 She is now in another country seeking political asylum after U.S.
 officials intervened, Mr. Probst said.
 
 "What bothers me about this case is not the Peruvian government,'' he
 said. "I can't expect much from scumbags and criminals. What bothers me
 is the U.S. government -- that we even follow a corrupt government. For
 example Fujimori, he's a one-person government. He's like Mussolini."
 
 Being deported to countries without strong traditions of due process can
 spell doom for any individual unlucky enough to fall into the situation,
 Mr. Probst said.
 
 "There's a lot of work ahead of us," he said. "If Qaddafi says 'Hans
 Probst is a terrorist in Libya and we have a treaty,' they could very
 well pick me up. It's amazing."
 
 Humble beginnings 
 
 Mr. Probst described Mr. Calero as a glorified farmer, a peasant who
 lived a meager existence off the land in the Andes Mountains. His
 daughter, 17, and sons, 13 and 9, remain in Peru, where they live with
 grandparents. Terrorists are common to the area, and many young people
 are accused of being a part of such groups, Mr. Probst added.

 Meanwhile, military police often operate through payoffs and kickbacks,
 using force whenever necessary, Mr. Probst said. Mr. Calero's father-in-
 law was severely injured and taken to jail by Peruvian authorities in
 May 1994.
 
 To charge Mr. Calero with participating in the Shining Path is absurd
 since he did not participate in political groups, Mr. Probst said.
 
 "All he was was a family man who took care of his family " Mr. Probst
 said. "He had no political ambition, never."
 
 Down on the farm 
 
 Relatives contend that Mr. Calero has been falsely accused. Mr. Calero
 explained the circumstances surrounding these allegations to Wiltonian
 Robert Harris from prison on May 30. Mr. Harris employed Mr. Calero to
 work as a gardener and at various odd jobs at his Ridgefield Road home.
 Mr. Calero told Mr. Harris that he fled from his home in Cajatambo,
 Peru, after police charged him with being a Shining Path sympathizer.
 
 The charge stems from an incident where criminals stole cattle from Mr.
 Calero, who turned the thieves in to police, Mr. Harris said. Mr. Probst
 added that the police condoned the crime and apparently received
 pay-offs for looking the other way.
 
 Case Work  
 
 Ms. Plotnik began working on Mr. Calero's case a year ago. She said that
 her client first applied for political asylum in 1993. An officer of the
 Immigration and Naturalization Service conducted an informal interview
 and denied the application in 1995, placing Mr. Calero under deportation
 proceedings. Ms. Plotnik said the setback is not an uncommon one in the
 process of seeking asylum.
 
 "The political situation in Peru is such that the government accuses
 numerous people of terrorist charges that are baseless" Ms. Plotnik
 said. "The reason Mr. Calero left is because he would have no chance of
 defending himself in that system."
 
 In Mr. Calero's case, police are retaliating because he renounced their
 acts of corruption in his town Ms. Plotnik said. She said it is crucial
 for the political asylum issue to be resolved before extradition is
 considered.
 
 The challenge ahead 
 
 Ms. Plotnik said since the extradition proceeding is not a criminal
 hearing, Peru does not have to prove Mr. Calero's guilt beyond a
 reasonable doubt Instead, U.S. Attorney Jeff Zimmerman, who will
 represent the Peruvian government, only has to prove the lower standard
 of probable cause.
 
 Some of the charges brought against Mr. Calero may have taken piece
 after he left Peru in 1991, Ms. Plotnik said. Still, the defendants'
 case will be difficult to present since some witnesses may still be in
 Peru. Since Mr. Calero lacks political asylum, Ms. Plotnik said
 attorneys cannot easily defend him in extradition proceedings on the
 grounds that be is being charged with committing a political offense.
 
 "My opinion is that he's in a bad position," Ms. Plotnik said. "He's
 suffering, in a sense, a life sentence or a death sentence. It's not
 going to be easy for him. I don't feel that optimistic about the case. I
 also think it is outrageous."
 
 Attorney Bert H. Nisonoff, who is also representing Mr. Calero, said he
 does not expect bail to be granted at Friday's bearing, which will take
 place at the Federal Courthouse of the Southern District of 	New
 York.  Mr. Calero has a greed card, a driver's license and a Social
 Security number. He has followed all the rules associated with
 establishing legal immigrant status in the United States, according to
 relatives. He also reported to all hearings related to his immigrant
 status.
 
 From the very beginning, he told immigration officials of the charge
 that the Peruvian government was bringing against him and of the human
 rights violations in Peru, Mr. Probst explained.
 
 "Being honest has certainly not worked out here," Mr. Probst said. "I
 have completely lost faith in the U.S. government.
 
 "We wanted to do everything legal," he said. "That probably was the
 biggest mistake we made. It hasn't worked here, and that's unfortunate."
 
 Family concerned 
 
 In addition to Ms. Roesch, Mr. Calero has three other sisters in the
 area.  Lila Probst and Angelica Quinoz reside in Ridgefield, while Dora
 Perez lives in Danbury. All are having to accept that their bother has
 been reduced to federal registration No. 43027054.
 
 Ms. Calero said in addition to The New York Times, Spanish radio and
 television stations have publicized accounts of her uncle's arrest.
 
 "My brother, he came to the United States looking for a safe place where
 can he live, because he was in danger in Peru," Ms. Quiroz said. "All of
 the charges against him by the government of Peru=97 there is no proof."
 
 Impact on the community 
 
 Mr. Harris said he and his wife were stunned upon learning of Mr.
 Calero's arrest. An article on the topic appeared in Tuesday's edition
 of The New York Times. "We were shock, we couldn't believe it," he said.
 "Of all the people, you could imagine you'd never believe that Julian
 could be involved in anything. A lot of people were moved to tears when
 they read the story and they wanted to know what they could do about
 it."
 
 "He has a lot of roots in the community and he is a person that everyone
 is very fond of," Mr. Harris said. "I don't know what we we can let the
 courts know, except for that he is not a person who presents any danger
 in the United States." Mr. Calero played pick-up soccer in a program
 that Karl Noivadhana of Sugarloaf Drive started four years ago. A team
 of men over the age of 35 who live or work in Wilton compete against
 teams from Westport, Bridgeport and Darien.  Mr. Noivadhana said that
 Mr. Calero was well-liked by teammates and clearly knew the game well.
 
 "He's a quiet gentleman who doesn't say much became his English is not
 that well," Mr. Noivadhana said. "He comes in, plays, has a good game,
 and then he goes home. He gets his exercise."
 
 Relatives plan on setting up stands at the Village Market in Wilton and
 at Stop & Shop in Ridgefield to collect signatures for their petition on
 Saturday from 10 a m. to 4 p.m.

     MIM NOTES 115                 JUNE 1, 1996


COUNTER-TERRORISM LEGISLATION TARGETS OPPRESSED NATIONALS

On April 25, Klinton signed broad "counter-
terrorism" legislation during a ceremony on the 
South Lawn of the White House. Families of those 
killed in the Oklahoma City bombing, the 1993 World 
Trade Center bombing and the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 
Flight 103 sat in the audience along with two dozen 
Democrat and Republican congress members.(1) The 
living victims of these attacks, along with 
Amerikans who have seen them sob on national TV, 
are being pacified with legislation which targets 
oppressed nationals--both outside and within U.S. 
borders. 

The Oklahoma City bombing a year ago spurred the 
most recent fury over passing the counter-terrorism 
bill. Yet the legislation, if in place a year ago, 
would most likely have done nothing to prevent the 
bombing of the Federal building. MIM does not call 
for legislation to fight so-called terrorist groups 
within the United Snakes, but takes this 
opportunity to point out the contradiction Amerika 
faces in cracking down on "terrorist" groups within 
the United Snakes--due to its rugged individualist 
history and the ultimate national unity among 
settlers.

The measures of the bill include: the possible 
deportation of aliens without revealing the 
evidence used against them, denial of people 
associated with U.S.-deemed terrorist groups entry 
into the United Snakes (even if the individuals 
have done nothing illegal), forbidding the transfer 
of funds to groups labeled "terrorist" (even if the 
money is for food or other necessities), and the 
strict limitation of habeas corpus appeals by both 
death row inmates and other prisoners.(2)


LAWMAKERS SLIP IN INCREASED REPRESSION OF PRISONERS

The Senate, according to the New York Times, has 
resisted passing legislation which exclusively 
restricts habeas corpus appeals.(3) A petition for 
habeas corpus is a vehicle for a prisoner to get a 
federal court to review his state court conviction, 
by arguing that the conviction itself, or the 
length of the sentence in some cases, was a 
violation of his/her federal constitutional rights. 
The anti-terrorism bill makes it much harder to get 
habeas review because the state court findings are 
now given a "presumption of correctness," whereas 
prior to this bill the state court findings were 
reviewed under a less stringent standard. The anti-
terrorism hysteria provides the perfect opportunity 
to further screw prisoners under a broader heading.

Under the new provision (which is currently being 
challenged by a case in Georgia (4)), death row 
inmates will have one year from the time of their 
conviction to appeal their sentences. Until passage 
of this bill there were no time limits on when a 
prisoner could file a habeas petition. Only one 
appeal will be allowed under the new bill, and any 
exception is limited to the issue of new evidence. 
The legislation imposes similar restrictions on 
other prisoners.

A study by the Association of the Bar of the City 
of New York found that death row prisoners show in 
40% of habeas corpus appeals that "...significant 
constitutional flaws undermine the reliability of 
their convictions or sentences."(3) But Amerika is 
more concerned with a scape-goat for crime which 
pisses off the settler masses than the fact that 
innocent people may be executed. MIM opposes all 
executions by the state because the U.S. government 
does not have the moral authority to decide such 
matters. The criminal actions of the U.S. 
government are far more destructive than any 
actions on the street by U.S. citizens (or non-
citizens).


CONTRADICTIONS ARISE IN FIGHTING DOMESTIC "TERRORISM"

The National Rifle Association (NRA) and the 
American Civil Liberties Union united to defeat 
several of the measures included in the original 
counter-terrorism legislation (proposed immediately 
after the Oklahoma City bombing). Increased 
wiretapping authority and lower standards to 
prosecute sellers of guns used in crimes were left 
out thanks to NRA lobbying efforts.(2)

The NRA and settler militia groups both oppose the 
federal government's interference with their right 
to stockpile weapons and "defend" themselves 
against those they consider the real terrorists--
oppressed nation groups, whether inside or outside 
the borders of the United Snakes. That is, any 
group which threatens the parasitic existence of 
the white nation or opposes U.S. hegemony. 

A real crackdown on right-wing militias would be 
settler disloyalty. These militias are often 
militant defenders of the original documents on 
which the United Snakes was founded. They also 
follow in the tradition of settler governmental 
opposition, which at times has grown fierce but 
never goes so far as to denounce its national 
loyalty altogether.

The part of the bill which will have the greatest 
effect on Amerikkkans is the one billion dollars 
the government will spend over the next five years 
to fight "terrorism" in the United Snakes. (This 
money does not include funds used to pay off right-
wing militia members like Randy Weaver when they 
scuffle with the FBI).

The counter-terrorism bill is more evidence to back 
MIM's position that nation is the principal 
contradiction and that settlers are imperialist 
allies. Who pays the price when Amerikans want 
revenge for "terrorism"--the most bloody of which 
was committed by fellow settlers? Oppressed 
nationals pay the price. Who gets compensated when 
their family is killed as a result of political 
violence? Not the Black Panthers, not American 
Indian Movement members, not MOVE, and certainly 
not the millions of people in the Third World who 
are the victims of U.S. imperialism. MIM opposes 
increased freedom of the U.S. government to conduct 
counterintelligence surveillance and we oppose the 
constant attacks on oppressed nation people. But 
most importantly, we oppose the terrorism of the 
United Snakes, who will some day be forced to pay 
restitution to the majority of the world's people 
for its widespread and incessant violence.

BODY COUNT MOUNTS FROM U.S. -- MEXICO BORDER

EDITOR'S NOTE: Nativists may hope the mounting death toll of undocumented
migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border may serve as a symbolic
deterrent. But in the hometown of three brothers who died in an April 6
crash following a high-speed chase by Border Patrol, the buses leave for
the north almost daily -- filled with news of labor shortages in
California's fields. PNS editor Ruben Martinez is a writer and
performance artist based in Mexico City and Los Angeles.

BY RUBEN MARTINEZ, PACIFIC NEWS SERVICE

CHERAN, MICHOACAN -- Two months ago, brothers Jaime, Salvador and
Benjamin Chavez-Munoz set out from this small Indian town in Michoacan's
highlands for Watsonville, Ca., to pick another season's crops. They
never made it. The pick-up they were riding in along with 23 other
undocumented immigrants catapulted off the highway in a high-speed chase
with the Border Patrol. The three brothers and five others were killed in
the crash.

The accident occurred on April 6, five days after the highly publicized
beating of three undocumented immigrants by Riverside sheriff's deputies.
Before the end of that month there was another fatal accident involving a
truck smuggling immigrants into California. On Father's Day, three
Mexican nationals were found dead, apparently from dehydration and
exposure to the Arizona desert sun. At least 14 others have been found
dead in the California desert since the beginning of the year.

As the toll mounts, the numbers begin to look like body counts from a
battle front. A study by the University of Houston documented over 3,000
deaths along the border in the last decade, most of them drowning in the
Rio Grande.

Nativists north of the border may hope that Cheran's body count will
serve as a cautionary tale for migrants across Mexico -- a kind of
symbolic "deterrent." Late last month, the Border Patrol initiated a new
campaign called "Stay Out, Stay Alive" -- a publicist's equivalent of
hanging the bodies of the dead on the border fence.

But here in Cheran, some 1000 miles from that line, the North still
represents a chance -- albeit an increasingly slim one -- for life.

Maria Elena Chavez-Munoz, mother of the dead, would rather no one left
Cheran for the north ever again. "I don't want any mother to have to go
through the pain I feel," she tells visitors in her one-room dirt-floor
house. But Wenze Cortez, her 19-year-old son-in-law, is all set to make a
break for the United States. "There's just no way to feed my wife and
child here," he says. "What's worse, this living death or dying trying to
truly live?"

"Just days after the brothers were killed, a bus carrying 80 people left
Cheran for the north," says Jose Luis Macias, a public school teacher
here. Macias's own family is split between Cheran and "los United". The
mostly unpaved roads are clogged with cheap and sometimes not-so-cheap
cars brought back after stints of work in the U.S., bearing license
plates from California, Missouri, Illinois, North Carolina, Georgia,
Florida, Washington and Pennsylvania.

Indeed, this town of 30,000 would wither away without money from
relatives working in the States. Town mayor Salvador Campanur estimates
some $3 million comes back each year in "remesas" (money orders from the
states). Roughly half the town's families still live in dirt-floor adobe
brick or scrap aluminum structures, but a good number of
concrete-and-plaster two-story homes, crowned by satellite dishes, line
many streets.

"What's funny is that the gringos are the ones who taught us to live like
this," says Sergio Velasquez, an attendant at the only gas station in
town. "And now that we're doing it, they tell us to stop!"

Velasquez began to migrate north at age 16. Now 22, married, with a
daughter, he built a modest home from money he earned picking tomatoes in
Mississippi, tobacco in North Carolina, watermelon in Kentucky. As a
youngster in Cheran, he dreamed of owning his own bicycle. Only in the
U.S. was he able to afford a second-hand one. "At least I had that one
luxury, something I could call my own. Once you've tasted the fruits of
your work, it's difficult to let that go."

The Chavez-Munoz brothers' tombstone is an elegant, five-foot high
miniature of a white twin-steepled church set on a slate-gray slab --
paid for by donations that have trickled in from relatives, friends and
strangers ever since the news of the accident arrived via one of the
town's two long-distance public phones.

Now the family is being pressured by the local loan-shark who lent the
brothers about $1200 for the trip. "It's an insult to the dead," cemetery
worker Ramiro Payeda says. He recalls an incident in which a big property
owner in town wanted to kick out some tenants who hadn't paid rent. "We
decided those people were born on that land and we weren't going to let
them be kicked out." After a not-so-subtle threat, the owner desisted.
The family still lives and works in Cheran.

Payeda falls silent as a blast sounds from the engine of a bus grinding
along the highway, headed north. Another chance to live.

CALL FOR PAPERS

REFUGEE RIGHTS AND REALITIES
approaches to law and policy reform

The Nottingham Human Rights Law Centre invites papers to be presented ata  
one-day conference at the University of Nottingham on Saturday 30November  
1996. Entitled "REFUGEE RIGHTS AND REALITIES -approaches to law and policy  
reform", the project will examine changingdefinitions, perceptions and  
strategies concerning refugees in the worldtoday.

The project will examine the evolving definition of the term refugee;the  
contemporary development of international refugee regimes fromprevention  
and early warning measures to containment and strategicsecurity issues;  
health, education and employment issues in terms bothof refugees' needs  
and potential; distinctions between migrant andrefugee at national,  
European and international levels; popularperceptions of refugees and the  
exploitation of these perceptions bythe far right; and the different roles  
which States and other playersincreasingly play. The conference is  
organised by the Human RightsCentre at the University of Nottingham as  
part of a research projectfunded by the Airey Neave Trust. It will bring  
together people froma broad background: legal practitioners, academics and  
officials ininternational organisations and NGOs, with a view to exploring  
thepossibilities for law and policy reform and their practical  
application.

The conference will open with a plenary session with papers byNicholas  
Blake QC, Glyn Ford MEP, Professor Guy S. Goodwin-Gill,Patricia Hyndman  
and Richard Plender QC followed by workshops, inwhich panellists will give  
a brief oral presentation followed by discussion.The nature of the papers  
submitted will ultimately determine the exact focusand structure of the  
workshops. Proposed workshops include the following:	(1) Who is a refugee?
	(2) Pre-emption and containment
	(3) Health care needs of refugees
	(4) Education and refugees
	(5) The UK and the Asylum and Immigration Bill
	(6) European harmonisation of refugee law and policy
	(7) Co-ordinating international, governmental and NGO roles

Case IND 230196.10
Tenth Follow up of
Case IND 230196

The International Secretariat of OMCT/SOS-Torture has just been informed of the release 
of all the Bhutanese Peace Marchers.

Brief description of the situation:

CVICT, a member of the network, reported the situation faced by a number of Bhutanese 
refugees who were on a peace march to Thimpu, Bhutan, to appeal to the King to resolve 
the Bhutanese refugee problem through a process of national reconciliation.

The original 150 peace marchers were detained in India in January. The Siliguri court, 
in India, declared their detention illegal and released them on the 27 February. The 
court then ordered the release of another 273 marchers who were released on 28 
February. The ruling stated that the imposition was illegal and that under the Bhutan 
Friendship Treaty the Bhutanese citizens had the full freedom of movement on Indian 
territory. At that time a further 344 Bhutanese refugees remained in Jail (Bahrampur).

Between 12 March and 12 June, 321 Bhutanese peace marchers had been arrested and 
detained.  Others were arrested and then immediately released..

The Calcutta high court upheld the decision of the Jalpaiguri Courts that stated that 
all the peace marchers would have to sign a personal release bond if they wished to be 
released. The bond, in effect, is a promise not to disturb the peace or violate any 
Indian Law, whilst on Indian Territory.

On 12 June 1996, Mr Babu Ram Shengden, a peace marcher who was detained in Barhampur 
Jail, died in Barhampur Sadar Hospital.  He had been arrested 28 March 1996.  He had 
been in poor health before he was arrested, but the Indian authorities had failed to 
give him appropriate medical attention.  He had been put in the hospital on 11 June 
1996.

Also on 12 June 1996, a further 50 Bhutanese peace marchers were arrested in Hasimara, 
near the Bhutanese border.  They are currently being detained in Alipurduar Jail.

On 19 June 1996, Indian police lathi charged 300 Bhutanese refugees marching in the 
funeral procession of Babu Ram Shengden to Bhutan.  One hundred people were injured.  
In the end, the Bhutanese refugees were forced to flee, leaving the coffin behind. The 
coffin of Babu Ram Shengden was removed 
later that evening by the police and taken to an undisclosed location.

New Information:

On 5 July 1996, all 791 Bhutanese peace marchers detained have been unconditionally 
released.  The decision came after the Calcutta High Court demanded justification from 
the public prosecutor of the Government of West Bengal for the continued detention of 
the Bhutanese peace marchers on 4 July. On 3 July, the  issue was brought up in the 
West Bengalis Legislative Assembly after strong lobbying efforts.

Since 20 June 1996, 143 of the peace marchers detained in Barhampur Jail had been 
conducting a hungerstrike.  When news of the unconditional release came, they 
immediately ended the hungerstrike.


The Bhutanese peace marchers are continuing their journey to Bhutan.

Remarks:

The International Secretariat expresses grave concern for the safety of the peace 
marchers as they arrive in Bhutan, given their history and extremely poor relations 
between the Bhutanese government and the Bhutanese people of Nepali descent. 



Please write to the Bhutanese authorities urging them to:

i.	guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the Bhutanese peace 
	marchers as they arrive in the country;

ii.	guarantee at all times respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms 
	according to national law and international standards.

Addresses :

His Majesty Jigme Sinye Wangchuck, King of Bhutan, Tashichhodzong, Thimpu, BHUTAN.

Diplomatic Representatives of Bhutan in your respective countries.

Geneva 9 July 1996

Kindly inform us of any action undertaken quoting the code of this appeal in your 
reply.

REEBOK HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRAMS
FEBRUARY 26, 1996

Dear Friend:

On behalf of the Reebok Human Rights
Award Board of Advisors,
I invite you to nominate a candidate for the
1996 Reebok Human
Rights Award.  The Reebok Human
Rights Award gives well
deserved recognition to young people
who are on the forefront
of the fight for human rights in the United
States and around the
world.  In addition to a $25,000 grant, the
Award brings national
 and international attention to the
recipient#s work, giving moral
support and personal encouragement to
the recipient as well.

Past Reebok Human Rights Award
recipients have worked on many
different human rights issues including
violence, immigration,
torture, hunger, abandoned street
children, indentured servitude,
racism, and indigenous rights.  For
example, by establishing
a taskforce of volunteers, a 29-year-old
advocate for the rights
of battered women in the United States
documented cases of
unpunished domestic abuse.  By bringing
this documentation
to the attention of local government
officials, she has been
 insturmental in changing the legal system.
 When a 25-year-old
labor rights activist who received the
Award in 1994 traveled to
his native Nepal after coming to Boston
for the Award ceremony,
he learned that the King of Nepal would
be honoring him and
that the government decided, for the first
time, to recognize
his organization officially and to make the
issue of bonded labor
in agriculture a priority.  A 1991 Award
recipient was a legal
aide working for the rights of migrant
farmers in Florida.
He himself experienced the deplorable
living conditions and
abuses of migrant workers first hand
before becoming an
activist himself.

As you can see from these examples,
candidates must be 30 years
 of age or younger, must not advocate
violence or belong to an
organization that advocates violence, and
must be actively working
, often against great odds, on some
aspect of human rights as
defined by the United Nations Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

I have enclosed a nomination packet
which details the Awar
d criteria and the nomination
requirements.  We will also
accept nominations submitted on the
Internet.  Please mail the
 completed nomination packet no later
than 30 April, 1996 to:

The Reebok Human Rights Award
100 Technology Center Drive
Stoughton, MA 02072
Internet: Siobhan_Flaherty@mcimail.com

We welcome your participation in
encouraging young activists
and champioining their work.

Sincerely,

Douglas Cahn, Director
Human Rights Programs

majority of senatorspresent. veto: Senate has the right to veto all  
legislation and thepresident has the power to veto all legislation, expect  
constitutionalamendments. Vetoes can be overridden by a majority of the  
total number ofdeputies.

POLITICAL PARTIES

The elections produced a stunning outcome. This was the first  
opportunityfor the population of the Czech Republic to select a government  
since thesplit with Slovakia in 1993. Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's center- 
rightcoalition, consisting of his Civic Democratic Party ( CDP) and two  
smallerallies--the Christian Democratic Party (KDU-CSL) and Civic  
DemocraticAlliance ( CDA)--was stripped of its parliamentary majority.  
Thiscoalition, which has ruled the Czech Republic for the last four years,  
wononly 99 seats--down from 112, and 2 less than a simple majority in  
the200-seat House of Deputies. President Havel has called on Mr. Klaus to  
tryto form a new government. He faces an uneasy challenge: obtaining  
thesupport of the strongest opposition party--the Social Democrats (  
CSDP). Itappears that he has achieved a basic agreement in only a week  
since theelections by granting the  CSDP leader, Milos Zeman, the House of  
Deputies'Chairmanship.
        Mr. Klaus's Civic Democratic Party received the strongest  
supporton election day with 29.6  percent of popular vote or 68  
parliamentaryseats. This figure is similar to result of the 1992  
elections. The realwinner of the elections, however,  was the opposition  
center-left CzechSocial Democratic Party ( CSDP) led by economist Milos  
Zeman. With a 26.4percent share of the popular vote, Zeman's Social  
Democrats leaped  from 24to 61 seats and now ranks as the parliament's  
second strongest party. Onlyfour other parties were able to achieve the  
required five percent. TheCommunist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (CPBM)  
received 10.3 percent or 22seats; the Christian Democratic Union -  
Czechoslovak People's Party(CDU-CPP) received 8.08 percent or 18 seats;  
the far-right Republican Party(ARCRP) received 8.01 percent or 18 seats;  
and the Civic DemocraticAlliance ( CDA) received 6.3 percent and 13 seats.
        Ten other parties ran in the elections but failed to break the  
5percent threshold. Pensioners for Life Securities, commonly referred to  
asthe "gray party" earned 3.09 percent, the right-wing Democratic  
Unionearned 2.8 percent, the Free Democrats, chaired by the popularformer- 
Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier, earned 2.05 percent and threeMoravian  
separatist parties earned little support--the Left Block and theCzech- 
Moravian Union of the Center lost their seats in the House ofDeputies.
        Voter turnout was a strong 76.26 percent, but this was down  
fromthe nearly 85 percent turnout in the 1992 elections.
        The Central Electoral Commission, the body charged with  
supervisingthe elections, received no complaints. However, shortly before  
theelections, the Constitutional Court in Brno ruled on two election  
issues.On May 15 the court upheld the constitutionality of the requirement  
thatmandatory registration fees be paid by the parties. On May 28 the  
courtoverturned a controversial decision by the Central Electoral  
Commission.The Court denied the Commission (made up of a panel of the  
politicalparties' representatives) the power to decide that a registered  
politicalparty constitutes a coalition. To gain a seat in parliament, a  
two-partyparty coalition must earn at least 7 percent of the vote.
        The Social Democrats sensational gains--almost a four fold  
gainfrom 1992--do not, however, indicate a shift of the electorate to the  
left. Unlike most East European countries, the current, pro-market, center- 
rightcoalition did not lose support during the last four years. (The loss  
of 13parliamentary seats is largely due to the seat distribution system.)  
CSDP'ssuccess is a not a result of dissatisfaction, but rather of the  
leftistvoters consolidating their support, which was previously split  
among manyparties, into one center-left party. The fact that the  CSDP is  
not atransformed ex-communist party is significant. The party was  
originallyestablished in 1878 and played a major role in Czech politics  
before WW II.This tradition, backed by an aggressive and well organized  
campaign in whichMr. Seaman criss-crossed the country in a bus nicknamed  
Zemak (potato) andrelentlessly attacked the economic reform program's  
shortcomings--incombating crime and, in particular, tax evasion, housing,  
health care andsocial policy--allowed the  CSDP to collect the protest  
votes of largesegments of society.
        Ironically, the CDP's backward-looking campaign, which stressed  
theachievements in the transformation of the society, helped some  
disaffectedvoters, who, nonetheless support reform, feel secure enough  
about Czechdemocracy to not feel obliged to vote for the governmental  
parties.
        As a result of the split vote, neither Klaus's Civic Democrats  
norZeman's Social Democrats are in a position to form a majority  
government.This is due to the fact that neither wants to form a coalition  
with thelittle reformed communists or the extreme and unpredictable far- 
rightRepublicans, which, together, won 40 seats.
        To form a left-wing government, the CSDP would need the  
CommunistParty's support. However, such an alliance has always been out of  
questionfor them. The journalist and a  CSDP-party member Premysl Janyr  
said thatany contemplation of forming a government with the tacit support  
of theCommunists would be--due to the Communist's current political  
course--suicide.
        Similarly, three ruling center-right parties refuse to rely onfar- 
right Republican Party's support to increase its seats from 4 to 18because  
of the Republican's virulently anti-Gypsy and anti-German platform.The  
Republicans do not intend to back any government. "Our instructions arenot  
to support anything or anybody," a Republican MP announced to themedia.
        In the first days following the elections, several scenarios  
ofbreaking the stalemate were discussed but, for the time being,  
rejected.The most obvious option, an early new election, found no support  
by themainstream parties. This alternative, likely to hang like Damocles'  
swordover the Czech political scene in the months and perhaps years ahead,  
wasonly endorsed by the leader of the Republican party.
        The two strongest parties, the  CDP and the  CSDP have also  
refusedto form a "grand coalition." This alternative was favored by Mr.  
Kalvoda,the leader of a minor  CDP coalition partner. Kalvoda, and some  
observers,argued that only the Austrian style "grand coalition" composed  
of the  CDPand the CSDP would create the necessary conditions for a stable  
government.        After the opposition CSDP dropped its outright  
insistence thatKlaus step down and agreed to support a right-of-center  
coalition of theCDP, the  CDA and the CDU-CPP under certain conditions,  
President Havel,who has been meeting with leading politicians to find a  
solution, askedKlaus on June 6 to begin negotiations on forming a minority  
government.
        At the same time, Havel asked members of the ruling three- 
partycoalition "to continuously discuss with the Czech Social Democratic  
Partyall aspects of its possible support for the government".
        The unofficially designated future Prime Minister Klaus faces  
twochallenges. First, he has to achieve an agreement on the allocation of  
thecabinet posts with his junior coalition allies, the CDU and the  CDA.  
Asthe CDU-CPP leader, Mr. Lux, indicated, the allies would like to  
increasetheir share of power so that the future cabinet is composed  
according to a8:4:4 ratio. Secondly, and more importantly, Klaus will have  
to reach anunderstanding with the Social Democrats on the terms of their  
support forhis minority government.
        In the meantime, the Social Democrats announced a list of  
theirrequirements. The  CSDP will withdraw its support, if the government  
programincludes fees for university education, Klaus's beloved idea of  
"individualheath care accounts," or further privatization of the transport  
and energysectors. Moreover, the program must include the creation of the  
regionalself-governments, removing the pension fund from the state budget,  
andintroducing a bill requiring that individuals prove the origin of  
theirassets. Furthermore, the  CSDP insists on reforming the health care  
system,in particular, reducing the number of health insurance  
companies,establishing a housing fund and adopting a law protecting  
tenants, a newlabor code, establishing an ombudsman's office and  
substantial reforming themeans-tested social subsidy scheme.
        Mr. Klaus responded by saying these requirements are  
exaggerated.On the other hand, Klaus's coalition appears ready to allow  
the  CSDP todominate Parliament. The  CSDP demanded House of Deputies'  
Chairmanship andthe chair of several committees. Mr. Zeman announced that  
if elected to theChairmanship, he would support proportional  
representation in theparliamentary organs. This means that members of both  
the Communist Partyand the Republican Party may fill some important  
parliamentary positions.

Subject: EELM: BULGARIA -- JUNE 1996, vol. I, no. 3 (part 2) L#1

UPDATE:

The law ON MUNICIPAL PROPERTY  was passed May 9, promulgated May 21  
andenacted June 1 (See EELM: Bulgaria -- May, vol. I, no. 2).

The law ON MEASURES AGAINST MONEY LAUNDERING was passed May 22

The AMENDMENT TO THE LAW" ON ELECTION OF PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT"  
waspassed May 9 and promulgated May 21 (See EELM: Bulgaria -- April, vol.  
I,no. 1).

The AMENDMENT TO THE "BANK AND FOUNDING ACT" was passed May 14  
andpromulgated May 15 (See EELM: Bulgaria -- May, vol. I, no. 2.).



POLITICAL PARTIES

In May the BSP government had to face a sudden financial and  
economiccrisis that challenged not only its current strategies and  
policies, butits entire ability to cope with the tasks of the economic and  
socialtransition in Bulgaria.
        The major elements of the crisis are:
        1. The banking system crisis. Procedures for the bankruptcy  
ofthree banks (including the biggest private bank, First Private Bank)  
wereinitiated, after Parliament passed the relevant law in May.
        2. A decline in public sector industrial production. During  
1995Bulgaria's GDP grew 2.6 percent after 1.4 percent growth during  
1994.However, in early 1996 this trend reversed: in February, public  
sectorindustrial production dropped by 8 percent relative to a year  
earlier,while March saw a 9 percent drop. During the first quarter as a  
whole,public sector industrial production took a 1 percent  drop compared  
to thesame period of 1995. This drop in productivity led the cabinet to  
reviseits growth projections for the rest of the year. Instead of the  
originallyenvisaged 3 percent increase of real GDP, the cabinet now  
predicts flatgrowth.
        3. Devaluation of the  lev. In January the exchange rate stood  
at76  lev per USD. However, in March it had leapt to 200-- currently  
theexchange rate is about 140  lev per USD. Correspondingly, the base  
interestrate has jumped from 39  to 108 percent.
        4. Sharp interest rate increases. In an attempt to check the  
steepdepreciation of the  lev, the BNB raised the base interest ratetwice-- 
first from 34 to 42 percent on February 5, then to 49 percent onMarch 6.  
However, these efforts were insufficient and on May 10, the baseinterest  
rate was hiked by an unprecedented 41 percentage points to 108percent and  
the BNB undertook active interventions in support of the  lev.
        5. Plummeting public support. During the first quarter,  
financiallosses of public enterprises from the industrial sector of the  
economy haveincreased approximately 12 percent compared to the same period  
of 1995. Inan attempt to solve this problem, the cabinet has approved the  
sale of 64state-owned companies. Moreover, another 70 state-owned  
enterprises will bebarred from borrowing money from banks. The public  
support of the cabinetand of acting Prime Minster Videnov is declining  
(public opinion surveysrecorded a drop in support of the cabinet of about  
ten points between Marchand May). International financial institutions  
have forced the BSP tointroduce drastic economic reform measures (closing  
down unprofitableenterprises, more than tripling the price of electricity,  
and almostdoubling the price of oil), which will inevitably cost the BSP  
even morepublic support.
        Trade unions are preparing mass protests against the BSP's  
policiesand asking for the support of the opposition parties. Although it  
has astable legislative majority with strong party discipline, the BSP  
hasproven unable to introduce quick and timely cabinet changes. This  
inabilityis partially due to Prime Minister Videnov's reluctance to do so.  
In Marcha BSP party forum, declared such changes indispensable--however,  
since theforum the only cabinet member removed by Videnov was the Minister  
of theInterior, who submitted his resignation after a scandalous  
interviewbroadcast on national TV. On May 31, a second BSP forum was held,  
at whichVidenov  was confronted with extremely critical assessments by  
some of theBSP MPs and party activists. The forum gave Videnov a week to  
introducemajor changes in the cabinet.

The major event for the opposition in May was the primary elections for  
theopposition presidential candidate. One of the opposition's most  
importantaccomplishments was the agreement it reached with the  
cabinet(specifically, Vice-Prime Minister Konakchiev) for official support  
andtechnical assistance for the primaries. The government provided the  
pollingboxes, buildings to house the polling stations, and security at the  
pollingsites.
        The primary polling stations were generally situated at the  
samesites to be used for the general election. The exact number of the  
pollingstations and their geographic distribution was one of the  
mostcontroversial issues to be resolved by the opposition partners, since  
theUDF candidate, Petar Stoyanov, is more popular in the three biggest  
cities,while President Zhelev's (the other candidate) support comes mainly  
fromrural and ethnic Turkish voters.
        The primaries were held June 1 and open to all eligible voters  
(theprimaries were neither closed [i.e., restricted only to party members]  
norcaucuses). The turnout was unexpectedly high--over 850,000 people  
tookpart. This amounts to about 20 percent of the eventual participants in  
thegeneral presidential elections and more than one-third of the votes  
neededfor victory in the general election.
        Stoyanov  won a clear victory of 66 percent, while Zhelev took  
33percent. The opposition parties asserted that the high turnout and  
thelarge margin of victory were symptoms of widespread discontent with  
BSPpolicy and evidence of growing public support for their platform.
        The primary results also encouraged the opposition MPs to  
initiatea vote of no confidence as a first step towards early elections,  
despitethe lack of any signal from BSP MPs that their ranks might be split  
by thecurrent political and economic crisis. The three opposition parties  
(UDF,PU and MRF) declared their intention to initiate such a vote, joined  
forthe first time by  BBB (since the election of the current cabinet,  
BBBleaders have always voted against the no-confidence votes initiated by  
theopposition). In any case, these are the first primaries ever held  
inEurope, and they are seen as a major step towards rationalization of  
thecooperation among the opposition parties.

BILLS

The bill ON  AMENDMENTS TO THE LAW "ON UNIVERSAL MILITARY OBLIGATION(12/29/ 
 1992)" was proposed due the large scale draft evasion, and thespread of  
corruption within those government bodies responsible forconscription.  
Though Parliament passed the bill, the president vetoed andreturned it for  
revisions.
        During the debates members of the parliamentary majority as well  
asrepresentatives of the government stressed the need to prevent  
draftevasion. The opposition, however, argued that the problem is caused,  
not byexcessive liberalism in the current legislation, but by the low  
morale andpoor living conditions in the country's military units. Against  
thebackground of numerous patriotic slogans, Parliament passed the bill  
andsent it to president for approval. The resolution adopted by the  
Parliamentamended Art. 1 of the law to the following wording:
"1. Citizens of Georgia have obligations for military service.
2. Citizens of Georgia who evade military or alternative service are  
notallowed to:
i. be appointed to senior official positions in state bodies or be  
electedto state or local government administrations;
ii. study at state institutions of higher education;
3. Citizen not residing permanently in Georgia drafted for military  
servicecan choose between military and alternative services."
        Article 26--concerning conditions under which a person may  
beexempted from military service--contains the provision "In special  
casesselectees can be exempted from military service by special decree  
signed bypresident of Georgia."
        The mass media reacted strongly to the bill, and the League for  
theProtection of the Constitution published a declaration in  
severalinfluential newspapers stating that Art. 1 contradicts the  
Constitution inthat it denies citizens of the right to an education and to  
hold anadministrative position, by means of introducing discriminatory  
measures.
        As expected, the president vetoed the legislation and returned  
itto the Parliament for re-examination. The president requested the  
removalof Art. 1's sanctions and also refused to accept the provision  
enablingpresident to exempt certain figures from military service because  
it wouldlead to people close to president exercising pressure on him.       
  Parliament apparently will take the president's remarks  
intoconsideration. However, a new problem has arisen since the legislation  
wasnot enacted before spring conscription, which now must be carried out  
underthe old law.

The importance of the bill ON REGISTRATION OF PERSONS WITH RESIDENCE  
INGEORGIA, drafted by the Constitutional, Legal, and Legislative  
Committee,cannot be underestimated since it envisages the establishment of  
genuinefreedom of movement and choice of residence. Until now Georgia  
hadmaintained the Soviet legal procedure that requires citizens be   
registeredat a permanent residence. Even with the ratification of the  
newConstitution (August 24, 1995), the Tbilisi City Council, rather  
thaneliminate the old system, on the contrary made it made it more  
stringent.
        According to current regulations, people are forbidden to reside  
inTbilisi without permission provided by the police. Furthermore, no one  
isallowed to purchase an apartment without the same permission. This  
issuehas received nearly constant attention from the mass media, where it  
wasrepeatedly pointed out how the policy clearly violates the  
Constitution,and the municipality was forced to renounce its decision in  
December 1995.Legal experts believe that a large number of bribery cases  
revolve aroundresidency regulations. The bill would replace the procedure  
of registeredpermanent residence with one of registration according to the  
actual placeof residence:
"Possession of registration or absence of registration should not be  
usedas a basis upon which a citizen could enjoy  his/her constitutional  
rightsand basic freedoms and should not be used as a condition for a  
citizen toenjoy those rights and freedoms" (Art. 2, Part 3).
        The bill contains the following provisions:
        "A person, moving to another permanent place of residence  
isobliged to inform the respective state body of his/her new place  
ofresidence within ten days, and he/she will receive his/her  
registrationwithin one day."  (Art. 5)
        "To receive registration, a person is obliged to present his/ 
herpersonal identification, proof of removal from the register from his/ 
herprevious place of residence, and a written agreement signed by  
theproprietor of the new place of residence." (Art. 6)
        "A person willing to register cannot be refused if he/she  
presentsall documents indicated in Art. 6, and no other law prevents doing  
so."(Art. 7)
        Strong opposition is expected from the police and local  
governingbodies because they would be losing both influence and a source  
of income.
The bill ON PROCEDURES CONNECTED WITH BANKRUPTCY was drafted by  
theMinistry of Justice and delivered to the Economic Policy and  
ReformCommittee and the Constitutional, Legal, and Legislative Committee.  
Duringexamination in the committees both MPs and experts agreed that the  
billgives too much power to the Ministry of Justice, e.g.:- Article 3.2 of  
the bill states that it is in competence of the Ministryof Justice to  
deliver investigations of bankruptcy cases to particularcourts. Bankruptcy  
has previously lay within the courts field ofcompetency.
- Article 12.2 states that the right to initiate an investigation into  
abankruptcy case and rules of compensation for respective expenses  
aregranted to the Ministry of Justice. MPs and experts argued that  
theserights should belong solely to the court that investigates a certain  
case,and, if needed, with the involvement of other court administrations.
- Article 14.a of the bill would regulate the imprisonment of  
debtorsaccording to regulations which the Civil Code does not recognize.  
Moreover,the bill does not envisage terms imprisonment or anything  
connected withimprisonment.
If the bill is passed it would invalidate the decree "On  
IndustrialBankruptcy" (9/8/1992) which has virtually never been put into  
practice.


RULES AND PROCEEDINGS

In April 1996 the Procedural Matters Committee of Parliament presented  
thebill ON THE REGULATION OF THE GEORGIAN PARLIAMENT. After examination  
incommittees MPs criticized it on the basis that it did not provide  
preciseand strict rules on the operation of  Parliament, MPs,  
parliamentaryofficials, committees, factions, temporary commissions, and  
personnel ofParliament, as well as other issues related to procedure.  
There are hardlyany precisely elaborated articles and all require serious  
changes. Thebill, furthermore, would give the excessive competence to the  
ProceduralMatters Committee e.g.:
        Article 27 states that the Procedure Matters Committee  
regulatescontrol over presentation of conclusions made by temporary  
commissions andover the period in which Parliament should observe  
commissions' activity.
        MPs have also complained that the Procedural Matters Committee  
isgranted too wide a range of competence in preparing and presenting bills  
inParliament, especially in the process of circulating bills. The  
Committeeassumes the functions of the parliamentary apparatus and  
exclusivelyexercises the right of advancing a bill from the point of view  
of legalconsiderations. Furthermore, the committee would reduce the  
independence ofthe governing body of the apparatus, by reserving the right  
to present theappointee for chief of the apparatus;
- Article 169.2 of the bill contradicts Art. 47 of Constitution of  
Georgia,since Parliament is forbidden to grant Georgian citizenship to  
foreigncitizens living in Georgia and to offer Georgian citizenship to  
those whodid not possess it.
Given these and other highly criticized provisions, the bill is expected  
tobe rejected and a new variant to be drafted.


Political Parties

Among parliamentary parties the attention is still focused on NDP,  
wherethe split in the party's leadership has widened beyond repair. The  
leaderof the party, Irina Sarishvili-Chanturia, held a special party  
congress andelected a new Central Committee. Previous members of the  
party's CentralCommittee were left out, including: the party parliamentary  
faction leaderMamuka Giorgadze, vice-speaker of Parliament Gia Kobakhidze,  
one of thefounders of the party Vano Khukhunaishvili and others. The  
special congressappointed Sarishvili-Chanturia as the new party  
parliamentary factionleader, and dismissed supporters of Mamuka Giorgadze,  
although they keepparty membership. The special congress violated many of  
the party'sby-laws, and supporters of Giorgadze simultaneously organized a  
meeting oftheir own.
        These events appear to mark  the end of the process of  
developmentof  mature national parties which were promoted and supported  
by alliedinterest groups. In Georgian politics, there no longer remains a  
realpolitically organized force in the form of a political party. On  
thecontrary, former Communist Party and Komsomol (the communist  
youthorganization in the USSR) nomenclature occupy many of the new  
positions ofpower. They recently come out of the shadows after having  
successfullylegalized the ownership of their property and are now  
beginning to recapturepositions of power.

Georgia still lacks an operational Constitutional Court. According to  
theConstitution and laws on the Court, it should have already begun its  
workby April 15. However, up to now only one judge has been appointed and  
thebuilding that should have been occupied by the Court has not  
beenapportioned. Neither the president, nor Parliament, nor the Supreme  
Court,have made their allotted appointments, though the Constitution  
providesthat each of them should appoint three members of the  
Constitutional Court.There are only two working weeks left until the  
Parliaments summer recess,and this makes the situation even more severe.

In political circles, the publication of the final conclusion on  
theNovember 1995 parliamentary and presidential elections made by  
theorganization Fair Elections created a large stir. This NGO, which  
receivesits funding from the National Democratic Institute in the United  
States,employed volunteer observers for spot check monitoring of the  
elections.The final conclusion of Fair Elections states that in many  
pollingdistricts violations of certain rules took place, members of  
localauthorities and police intervened in the election processes  
whichinfluenced results of those elections. This conclusion calls  
specialattention to the conclusion made by international (e.g. OSCE)  
observers whopositively evaluated the elections. Fair Elections claims  
that the positionof international observers was guided rather by political  
considerationsthan by an objective gathering of facts. As expected, the  
government metthis publication with a rebuttal. The president's spokesman  
explainedconclusion of the Fair Elections as result of communist blessing  
andAmerican financing. At the same time, the independent press believes  
thatFair Elections made the most objective conclusion on the elections  
andtheir activity could be regarded as a first serious display of  
civilsociety attempting to exercise some control over state activities.

The B&H Media Week in Review: 10-16 June


   Democracy under Attack

The thugs who attacked Haris Silajdzic in Cazin on 15 June not only drew  
blood from the leader of the Party for B&H, they also provided government- 
aligned broadcasters with an unwelcome opportunity to inflict even more  
serious wounds upon their own reputations for competence and credibility.   
Their reports of the incident were late, confused and partial, indicating  
a failed attempt to manage and minimise the story.

TV B&H reported the assault on Silajdzic in the middle portion of its  
football-delayed "Dnevnik" on Saturday night.  The Party for B&H's press  
release, alleging that Silajdzic's attackers had carried SDA flags and  
pictures of President Izetbegovic, was, however, read in full.  By Sunday  
night, the story had ascended the scale of newsworthiness, and an equally  
late "Dnevnik" was devoted almost entirely to the event.  Coverage began  
with an account by the Federal Ministry of Interior of how the Cazin  
police had done all in their power to protect Silajdzic, defending him  
with their own bodies.  This statement was reinforced by telephoned  
testimony by Edhem Veladzic, minister of police in the Unsko-Sanski  
canton.  According to him, the police had indeed intervened in Cazin; but  
he excused the violence by alleging that "one person in the last row at  
the [Party for B&H's earlier] convention in Bihac had sworn at President  
IzetbegoviC and insulted Islam."  Bihac is 25 km from Cazin.

The pictures of Silajdzic's wounds and damaged car which followed belied  
the insistence by the authorities that he had been fully protected.  While  
the former premier, speaking by telephone from Zagreb, claimed that the  
confrontation had lasted for some four hours, during which time the police  
were nowhere to be seen.  Next came an OSCE statement condemning the  
incident and supporting Silajdzic's version of events.  OSCE observers had  
been present and had witnessed what took place.

Radio B&H's flagship newscast, the 15.00 "Dnevnik", generally avoids  
mention of opposition parties.  On 15 June, however, it gave extensive  
coverage to the joint press conference of the five parties (UBSD, SDP,  
HSS, MBO and RS) seeking belated registration for their combined list to  
fight the Mostar elections.  Yet any notion that this development might  
have augured a new policy of editorial openness towards the opposition was  
scotched the next day.  News of the attack on SilajdziC was omitted from  
the headlines and relegated to fourth place on what was otherwise made to  
seem a thin news day.  Without any on-the-spot report, Radio B&H relied on  
meagre agency despatches, fragmentary extracts from the Party for B&H's  
communique and longer citations from that of the SDA.  "Dnevnik" listeners  
were left to ponder the meaning of President IzetbegoviC's statement,  
broadcast the previous afternoon, that "on the territory controlled by the  
legitimate B&H government there are no problems regarding access to the  
media."

   Manipulation on the North-West Frontier

The Unsko-Sanski canton represents a virtual information desert so far as  
Federation-based media are concerned.  Radio and television signals  
emanating from neighbouring Croatia and Republika Srpska dominate the  
airwaves.  Radio BihaC relies upon Radio B&H for its reports of national  
and international events.  When Radio B&H's signal cannot be heard, then  
Radio Bihac omits all but local news from its bulletins. These, however,  
appear designed to support the ruling SDA in the canton.  Our Bihac  
monitor reports as follows on the media week leading up to the  
disturbances in Cazin:


The B&H Army's celebration of "The Days of June Resistance" served to  
publicise a religious leader - the Bihac mufti - who is also one of the  
SDA chieftains in the region.  Radio Bihac's (21.00) "Hronika dana" on 12  
June broadcast a part of his speech at the army gala that day.  His basic  
message was clear: "Those who invented fascism cannot teach us democracy.   
We dare not allow anyone else to teach us democracy.  What they want, when  
they teach us that democracy, is to break us and to finish off what our  
enemies started."  The same army celebrations were used on 15 June to  
promote General Dudakovic's SDA career.

Several times during the week Radio Bihac carried advertisements for the  
founding assembly of the Party for B&H which took place in the town on 15  
June.  That evening, at 21.15, it broadcast a recording of the proceedings  
as a supplement to "Hronika dana".  In introducing the item, the chief  
editor explained, almost apologetically, that, "In compliance with the  
rules on the behaviour of the media in the course of the elections, we are  
broadcasting the convention in its entirety."  This it did, without any  
sort of intervention.

Also on that evening's "Hronika dana", Radio Bihac aired a commentary by  
the journalist A. Danicic regarding the appearance in Cazin and Bihac on  
14 and 15 June of Muslim Youth Alliance (MOS) posters.  These explicitly  
attacked Silajdzic, his party and followers.  The reporter described them  
as "a vulgar attempt to discredit Mr Haris SilajdziC."  Yet Radio BihaC  
provided no news whatsoever about the day's disorders in Cazin.

Its first report of the attack on SilajdziC was broadcast only on 16 June,  
in the 21.00 "Hronika dana", and as the fourth item in the newscast.  It  
began, "According to a statement by the Party for B&H..." - yet proceeded  
to give a short account of the incident which bore no relation to the  
party's communique.  The statement issued by the SDA headquarters in  
Sarajevo regarding the incident was, however, broadcast in full.  There  
followed a report on the "regular meeting of the Cantonal Council of the  
SDA-BihaC, held on Sunday, 16 June, which discussed the formation of  
electoral lists, the release of certain members of the Council from their  
duties and the need to investigate events in Cazin."

Radio Bihac's presentation of the news about the incident in Cazin appears  
to have aimed to marginalise the event and to prepare listeners for the  
manipulative communique from the BihaC Centre of the Security Service  
(CSB) that followed.  This presented the public with unsubstantiated  
allegations which were at odds both with eyewitness reports and this  
monitor's own observations, viz that there had been trouble during the  
Party for B&H's Bihac convention, that insults and obscenities had been  
hurled both at IzetbegoviC and Islam during the meeting, and that  
SilajdziC's followers had provoked the disorders.  In fact, the CSB  
statement itself added to the tension in Bihac and Cazin by identifying  
those who attended the Party for B&H's Bihac meeting as "those who did  
nothing for the defence effort in the course of the war and among whom  
there were a large number of Fikret Abdic's followers."

Radio BihaC's coverage of this local story was totally unprofessional.  It  
failed to report the statements of any party except the SDA.  It made no  
mention of the OSCE communique.  It sought the reactions of no notable  
persons nor even of any local representatives of the Party for B&H.  In  
short, Radio BihaC demonstrated this week that it makes no pretense of  
possessing any independence.

   Cazin in the Independent Media

Sarajevo's NTV Studio 99 devoted the bulk of its 16 June "Oko 22" to the  
attack on SilajdziC.  In contrast to the coverage offered by the state-run  
media, this broadcast served as an exceptional promotional vehicle on  
behalf of the Party for B&H and its leader.  Radio Studio 99, for its  
part, mounted a special edition of "Hyde Park" on Sunday in order to give  
callers an opportunity to discuss the issue.

Although they are unrelated, both NTV Hayat and Bosnian Muslim Radio Hayat  
gave preference on 16 June to the visit by Federation Interior Minister  
Avdo Hebib to Gorazde.  TV Hayat, in particular, sought to play down the  
significance of the violence in Cazin.

   Reports from the Near Abroad

Justifiably intoxicated as they may have been by the Croatian football  
team's 3-0 victory over Denmark on Sunday evening, the journalists of HRT  
managed to provide a full and balanced account of the Cazin affray in  
their late-night edition of "Dnevnik".  This was particularly interesting  
in view of recent assertions by Croatian reporters of their country's  
special relationship with the BihaC region.

Even more interesting, however, was the "Dnevnik" editor's decision to  
append an analytical report from Slovene TV to the end of the programme.   
The Slovene despatch argued that the attack on Silajdzic should not be  
treated as the mere incident the SDA pretended it to be.  Rather, it was  
one of a series of similar cases, including SDA Vice-President Edhem  
Bicakcic's threat that the party would show no mercy to the opposition and  
the beating administered to USBD members in Tesanj.  The report concluded  
that responsibility for the unhappy events in Cazin lay squarely at the  
door of the local authorities and the ruling party to which they belonged.

IN TV (aka Bildt Television) may wish to consider sub-contracting its news  
service to Radio-Television Slovenia.

   Coverage from the Far Abroad

The foreign press showed far more interest on Sunday and Monday in the  
nomination of new ministers to the supposedly non-existent government of  
"the Croatian Republic of Herceg-Bosna" than it did in events in Cazin.   
Silajdzic's travail was mentioned only in passing.  The B&H media, on the  
other hand, ignored the HDZ's challenge to the Federation almost totally.   
Even Herceg-Bosna's own broadcasters appear to have had little to say  
about the move.  It seems that they, like the Sarajevo-based media, are  
awaiting instructions.

   Fear and Loathing in Republika Srpska

A campaign of sorts is continuing in Republika Srpska, with the state  
media offering blanket coverage of mass rallies called in support of the  
indicted war criminals Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic. The "mitinzi"  
have quickly assumed the flavour of SDS election rallies, with only the  
small, Belgrade-based Serbian National Renewal party (SNO) joining the  
festivities. In its main evening newscast, TV Srpska offered prominent  
coverage of rallies in Nevesinje, Brcko and Bijeljina. The Brcko rally was  
given extended play in the slot immediately following the 13 June news.  
With the exception of the SNO leader, Mirko JoviC, all participating party  
representatives were from the SDS. In addition to unofficial campaign  
propaganda, the rallies appear to be part of a broad SDS effort to link  
the fate of  the RS with that of KaradziC and Mladic. "The trial of  
Karadzic is the trial of the Serbian nation," read one placard displayed  
at the Brcko rally.

Despite initial hostility to the idea of elections, TV and Radio Srpska  
appear to have warmed to the poll in the aftermath of the Florence  
conference. Broadcasts were brimming with optimistic assessments of the  
September vote, with one SDS official predicting it would mark the RS's  
final entry into statehood. Another SDS vice-president suggested the  
ruling party could surpass its performance in 1990, when it won the  
support of "95 percent of the Serbian nation in the former B&H." TV Srpska  
has yet to broadcast any detailed description of the 18 parties contesting  
the elections in the RS. So far, the vote is presented as a plebiscite on  
the RS's statehood. This is fully in line with SDS posters which portray  
the SDS as the only party committed to the defence of the RS.

Elsewhere in the RS, the only apparent exception to a week of programming  
devoted to the SDS and its semi-official partner, the Serbian Radical  
Party,  was aired on Radio Prijedor's 12 June bulletin. In a commentary  
entitled "A prayer for my brother journalists," M. Mutic attacked the  
ruling SDS as a clique of cynical manipulators and corrupt warmongers who  
had a stranglehold on the RS media. Mutic bitterly protested against the  
lack of political freedoms in the RS, in particular free speech.  The RS  
government treats journalists as  "unpaid servants or animals for the  
hunt", said Mutic, adding that the moral and professional dignity of  
journalists throughout the RS was under constant assault.

   The Print Media

Election coverage by the Sarajevo press has expanded both quantitatively  
and qualitatively in the past week.  Not only has the number of articles  
increased, but so too has the calibre of the journalism.  The three, self- 
styled  independent dailies are continuing to provide space for the  
election campaigns of the opposition parties.  Their doors may not yet be  
wide open to the opposition, but they are certainly more than ajar.

The decision of the Florence conference that elections will indeed be held  
in September was reported by the papers as one of the results of the  
conclave, but without expressions of approval or praise.  The press has  
also followed developments in Mostar attentively, including the attempt to  
form a united opposition, the stances of the Croatian parties and the  
policies of EU Administrator Perez Casado.

Media Briefs

RTV Mostar & Radio Herceg-Bosna

East Mostar's radio and television stations (which broadcast virtually  
identical news programmes) began last week to engage actively on the  
forthcoming local elections.  TV Mostar is now carrying voter education  
items provided by OSCE and USAID before and after its evening news  
broadcasts. But lodged among these public service announcements there is  
one spot exhorting viewers to "Vote for the united Mostar list!" This, of  
course, is a party political advertisement pretending to be something  
else.  Given the omnipresence of Mayor Safet Orucevic on TV Mostar's  
newscasts, however, the offence may be considered a trifling one.

Radio Herceg-Bosna, for its part, continues to report every manifestation  
of HDZ activity and to ignore all other parties.  The attack on Haris  
Silajdzic offered it, however, a temptation it could not resist to  
disparage the concept of a common Bosnian statehood.  According to the  
21.00 news on 16 June, "The first settling of accounts has begun, and not  
just politically, but physically... Just think, they attacked the Party  
for B&H... when their mouths are full of their constant protestations  
about how they are for B&H and that is why they have fought and  
struggled."

TV B&H

The hour-long programme "B&H Elections" is, it seems, still being  
boycotted by the larger opposition parties.  Only the small Civil  
Democratic Party (GDS) took up the offer of a four-minute slot in last  
week's broadcast (10 June).  The rest of the programme was composed of  
reports about party press conferences and public statements.  The  
programme is even-handed and professionally produced.

TV Tuzla

Why has TV Tuzla recently abandoned its evening broadcasts, and why does  
that mean that it cannot offer any election programming?  Is it because of  
unpaid rent and utility bills to the owner of its premises, the  
Osiguravajuci zavod (Insurance Bureau), or is there some other reason?  TV  
Tuzla's explanation is that its landlord has cut night porterage in the  
building, and that everyone must now leave the premises by 9 pm.  Does  
that mean that no one guards TV Tuzla's equipment during the night?  Is  
the problem that TV Tuzla cannot afford to pay a porter?  Or are rumours  
of a party politcal vendetta against TV Tuzla to be credited?  Even so,  
why can't an election programme go out earlier in the day?-

Subject: Sierra Leone - information about the treatment of
members or leaders of the National League for Human Rights and
Democracy, a list of the current government and a brief summary
of the current situation in Sierra Leone.
------------------------------------------------------------

     Recent Country Reports from the US State Department make the
following comments: "the League for Human Rights and Democracy,
...., its effectiveness is hampered by government intimidation and
a lack of resources. In at least one instance in 1993, the
League's director was summoned by police for questioning
regarding his activities" (1993, p 256); "the Government
permitted the sole local human group, the League for Human Rights
and Democracy to exist, but hampered its effectiveness by
intimidation" (1994, p 225); "the Government allows one local
human rights group, the League for Human Rights and Democracy to
exist" (1995, p 9).

     There are a number of references elsewhere to individuals
connected with the National League for Human Rights and
Democracy: a Sulaiman Banja Tejan-Sie, an executive member who
joined the military government as Secretary of State for Youth,
Sport and Social Mobilization in April 1995 (Inter Press Service,
7th April 1995); a Sallieu Kamara, secretary general in January
1995 (Inter Press Service, 9th January 1995); and Allieu Kanu,
chairman in November 1994 (Inter Press Service, 15th November
1994).

     Most information is available about Paul Kamara, also
reported to be chairman of the National League for Human Rights
and Democracy and editor of a newspaper critical of the
government called "For Di People". In August 1992, Inter Press
Service reported that Kamara "played a key role in justifying the
military takeover" [of April 1992] but another report from the
same source, in March 1993, noted that Kamara "has been jailed
several times by the Sierra Leone military junta" and New
African, May 1996, quotes Kamara as saying that he had refused
an offer to work with the military following April 1992. Kamara's
criticism of the military government is reported in Inter Press
Service 20th February 1993 and 4th February 1994.
     In September 1995, Kamara was briefly detained, "not for the
first time", after his paper criticised the military government
(Inter Press Service, 22nd January 1996 and Country Reports for
1995, p 7). In January 1996, following Bio's ousting of Strasser,
Kamara accepted a post as Minister in the military government
(Inter Press Service, 22nd January 1996 and New African May
1996). On February 26th, Kamara was the victim of an alleged
assassination attempt, which he attributes to government elite
troops, and is currently convalescing in the UK (New African, May
1996, which also suggests that the assassination attempt might
be explained by Kamara's upsetting people while in government
office).

     A list of the new cabinet appointed by President Kabbah in
April 1996 is attached (from Africa Research Bulletin, 23rd May
1996, p 12226) and this notes that Abdul Rahman Kamara is the newMinister  
for Lands, Housing Town and Country Planning.

     Sierra Leone returned to civilian rule in March 1996 when
Brigadier Bio handed over power to President Kabbah of the SLPP.
President Kabbah has continued Bio's peace negotiations with the
leader of the rebel RUF, Foday Sankoh, and it has been suggested
that 26 out of 28 provisions for a Peace Accord have been agreed,
with one of the disputed issues being the RUF demand for the
withdrawal of the government-paid mercenaries of Executive
Outcomes from Sierra Leone (West Africa, 17th-23rd June 1996).
In contrast to reports of peace talks and the ceasefire agreedin March  
1996, there are a number of reports of continuing rebel
attacks. For example, in June 1996 concern was expressed over
"the rising incidence of atrocities by rebels" (West Africa, 10-16 June 1996) and the government accused the RUF of "nationwide
violations of a ceasefire agreement" (Agence France Presse, 7th
June 1996). Aid agencies are said to have reported a "wave of
terror attacks in the countryside" (Reuters World Service, 6th
June 1996). A cautionary note has also been raised by The
Economist Intelligence Unit, in "Sierra Leone: Dim Prospects for
Civilian Rule", 22nd May 1996: "although the most recent RUF
ceasefire gives more cause for optimism than for several years,
such conflicts have in the past displayed a grisly logic that (as
in neighbouring Liberia) can resist virtually any move towards
peace" .

    PART 1 of 2 PARTS
    =================================
    GENERAL SITUATION

    1. THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDED UPDATED INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF
    THE DISASTER IN FIVE AFFECTED GOVERNORATES AS FOLLOWS:

  GOVERNO-    DEATH    MISSING   AFFECTED   HOUSING    ROADS/
  RATES       TOLL               POPULATION DESTR./    BRIDGES

  BR.

  IN ADDITION, 5,500 LIVESTOCK WERE KILLED AND 30 GENERATORS, 250
  WATERPUMPS, 8 HEALTH CENTRES AND 8 SCHOOLS WERE DESTROYED OR
  DAMAGED.

    2.  THE UN/DHA RESIDENT COORDINATOR, THE UN ASSESSMENT MISSIONS
    AND THE UNDAC TEAM REPORTED ON THEIR ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF
    THE FLOODS IN THE GOVERNORATES OF MAREB, SHABWA AND AL JAWF.

    MAREB GOVERNORATE

    3. MAREB GOVERNORATE HAS 11 DISTRICTS WITH A TOTAL POPULATION OF
    183,000. THE FLASH FLOOD HIT THE POPULATION IN WADIS (20 - 35 KM
    LONG) IN 6 DISTRICTS. THE UN ASSESSMENT TEAM REPORTS THAT THE
    IMPACT WAS INCREASED BY THE FACT THAT LOCAL FARMERS HAVE
    CONSTRUCTED THEIR HOUSES IN THE WADI-BED AND HAD STARTED USING
    WADI-BEDS AS AGRICULTURAL LAND.

    4.  ALL HOUSES LOCATED ON THE SIDES OF THE WADI WERE SEVERELY
    DAMAGED, SOME WASHED AWAY. THE MAJORITY OF HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE
    LIVING WITH THEIR CLANSMEN. IN SOME CASES, THEY ARE TEMPORARILY
    RESIDING IN MAKESHIFT CAMPS. SOME CASES OF MALARIA, TYPHOID AND
    DIARRHOEA WERE REPORTED. AREA SERVICED ONLY BY HEALTH STATIONS
    WITHOUT MEDICAL DRUGS OR MODERN EQUIPMENT. WATER SUPPLY HAS BEEN
    DISRUPTED.

    5. SEVERE DAMAGE TO ELECTRICITY NETWORK: 113 ELECTRIC POLES
    WASHED AWAY, 2,300 M OF ELECTRIC WIRE DESTROYED, 4 MAIN
    GENERATORS (20 - 40 KW) DAMAGED. 2 HEALTH CENTRES AND 8 SCHOOLS
    WERE ALSO DAMAGED.

    6. AGRICULTURAL LAND AND STANDING CROPS  WERE WASHED AWAY,
    INCLUDING MODERN AGRICULTURAL FARMS WHICH WERE CONSTRUCTED IN THE
    FRAMEWORK OF A WORLD BANK PROJECT.  IRRIGATION INFRASTRUCTURE,
    CONSISTING OF CANALS, PIPES, WELLS AND PUMPS, WAS DAMAGED OR
    COMPLETELY WASHED AWAY.

  SHABWA GOVERNORATE

  7. SHABWA GOVERNORATE HAS 5 DISTRICTS WITH A TOTAL POPULATION OF
  375,000. AFFECTED DISTRICTS ARE MEIFAH, AS SAID, NISSAB AND BEIHAN,
  THREE OF WHICH WERE VISITED BY THE UN ASSESSMENT TEAM.

  8. HOMELESS FAMILIES ARE BEING SUPPORTED BY RELATIVES OR FRIENDS,
  BUT MANY OF THEM ARE STILL LIVING IN THE OPEN. CASES OF DISARRHOEAL
  DISEASES WERE REPORTED AND THERE IS A RISK OF FURTHER CASES IF SAFE
  WATER SUPPLY IS NOT RESTORED. AN INCREASE IN MALARIA IS ALSO
  EXPECTED. THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE RISK OF STARVATION, ALTHOUGH FOOD
  STOCKS ARE RUNNING LOW. FOOD PROVIDED BY WFP IS EXPECTED TO REACH
  ATAQ - THE CAPITAL OF SHABWA PROVINCE - WITHIN A DAY OR TWO. FOOD
  IS TARGETED TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO ABOUT 1,150 FAMILIES MADE HOMELESS
  BY THE FLOODS.

  9. IN MANY VILLAGES, WATER SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED OR DAMAGED,
  LEAVING THE POPULATION WITHOUT ACCESS TO POTABLE WATER. THE
  GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES THAT 80 % OF THE PUBLIC WATER NETWORK,
  DRINKING WATER WELLS AND PRIVATE WELLS WERE DESTROYED.    IN SOME
  AREAS, THE POPULATION IS RELYING ON OPEN WATER FROM THE WADI
  CONTAMINATED WITH RAW SEWERAGE. ACCESS TO WATER COULD BE MADE
  AVAILABLE THROUGH PROVIDING PUMPS AND/OR GENERATORS TO DRAW WATER
  FROM OPEN WELLS.  WATER FOR THE TOWN OF ATAQ IS BEING TRUCKED IN,
  AS ALL WELLS SUPPLYING DOMESTIC WATER HAVE BEEN SEVERELY DAMAGED.

  10. A NUMBER OF ELECTRICAL POLES AND WIRES COLLAPSED IN THE WADIS.
  TWO MAJOR ELECTRICAL GENERATORS WERE DESTROYED. ELECTRICITY SUPPLY
  TO RURAL AREAS IN THE AFFECTED DISTRICTS HAS BEEN CUT OFF. THE
  PRIMARY ROAD NETWORK REMAINS BY AND LARGE INTACT. HOWEVER, SEVERAL
  WADI CROSSINGS HAVE DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY. DAMAGE TO RURAL ROADS
  VARIES DEPENDING ON THE LOCATION, BUT ACCESS TO MOST AREAS IS NOW
  POSSIBLE.

  11. LARGE AREAS ALONG THE WADI (70 PER CENT OF PRODUCTIVE
  AGRICULTURAL LAND) WERE WASHED AWAY, INCLUDING MOST OF THE FRUIT
  GARDENS AND SOME CROP LANDS. LOCAL IRRIGATION DITCHES AND INLET
  STRUCTURES HAVE DISAPPEARED.

  AL JAWF GOVERNORATE

  12. ON 21 JUNE, THE UNDAC TEAM , TOGETHER WITH A GOVERNMENT
  DELEGATION  AND THE UN/DHA RESIDENT COORDINATOR, CONDUCTED AN
  ASSESSMENT BY HELICOPTER IN AL JAWF GOVERNORATE, WHERE THEY WERE
  RECEIVED AND ACCOMPANIED BY THE GOVERNOR. THE TEAM REPORTS THAT AL
  JAWF IS LESS SERIOUSLY AFFECTED THAN MAREB AND SHABWA.  FLOOD WATER
  HAS RECEDED, LEAVING SMALL SHALLOW STAGNANT POOLS. KEY BRIDGES ON
  THE (PAVED) MAIN ROAD FROM SANA'A TO AL JAWF HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.
  ONLY 4 WD VEHICLES CAN PASS AND DELIVERY OF GOODS WITH HEAVY TRUCKS
  (OVER 10 MT) IS NOT POSSIBLE AT PRESENT. MANY WELLS ARE FULL OF
  DEBRIS AND REQUIRE CLEANING. STANDING CROPS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED,
  BUT NO  ESTIMATION OF DAMAGE IS PRESENTLY POSSIBLE.

  13. LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE PROVIDED FOOD FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS.
  WATER SUPPLIES ARE BEING TRUCKED FROM NEARBY SOURCES. URGENT RELIEF
  NEEDS HAVE BEEN MET AND THE SITUATION IN AL JAWF IS NO LONGER
  CONSIDERED A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.

    INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

    14. A DONOR MEETING WAS CONVENED ON SUNDAY 23 JUNE, CHAIRED BY
    THE UN RESIDENT COORDINATOR, AND ATTENDED BY EMBASSIES, UN
    AGENCIES AND NGOS. PARTICIPANTS WERE BRIEFED ON THE OVERALL
    SITUATION IN THE SIX AFFECTED GOVERNORATES AND EXCHANGED
    INFORMATION ON ASSISTANCE NEEDS,  PLEDGES AND  CONTRIBUTIONS. THE
    UN DISASTER MANAGEMENT TEAM (UN-DMT) MET SUBSEQUENTLY AND AGREED
    ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AMONG UN AGENCIES.

    15. EFFECTIVE COORDINATION AND DELIVERY OF RELIEF SUPPLIES WILL
    BE ENSURED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ON-SITE OPERATIONS
    COORDINATION CENTRE (OSOCC) WITHIN UNDP SANA'A. THE OSOCC WILL BE
    STAFFED BY THE UNDAC TEAM, REPRESENTATIVES FROM UN AGENCIES AND
    GOVERNMENT COUNTERPARTS AND WILL FULFILL THE FOLLOWING MAIN
    TASKS:
    -    MAINTAIN AND UPDATE RELIEF AND REPAIR REQUIREMENTS
    -    ACT AS A CENTRAL CLEARING HOUSE FOR DELIVERY OF RELIEF ITEMS
    -    UPDATE SITUATION REPORTS AND REPORT ON PROGRESS
    -    SUPERVISE IMPLEMENTATION OF RELIEF ASSISTANCE AND REPAIR
    SERVICES.

Subject: HRW: Macedonia--Human Rights Violations Persist

FOR RELEASE JUNE 26, 1996 00:01 GMT

The Macedonian government is responsible for significant human rights
violations since independence from Yugoslavia was achieved in 1991, according
to Human Rights Watch/Helsinki.  In A Threat to Stability: Human Rights
Violations in Macedonia, released today, the organization finds that Macedonia
has made some important progress in the last five years towards establishing a
democratic system based on the rule of law.  However, many serious problems
remain.  While political and economic pressures in the southern Balkans are in
part to blame, the current Macedonian government is also responsible for
"violating the rights of its citizens."

Of particular concern is the status of Macedonia's many national minorities,
especially the sizable Albanian population.  Despite some improvements, ethnic
Albanians still suffer discrimination in state employment and
minority-language education.

But minority groups are not the only victims.  Limitations on the press,
violations of due process and harassment of the political opposition affect
all Macedonian citizens regardless of their ethnicity.

On the positive side, Macedonia has avoided the war in the former  
Yugoslavia.Human Rights Watch/Helsinki highlights the "calming effect" of  
the United
Nations force, which includes 500 Americans, and the mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  The report also,
however, criticizes both international organizations for downplaying human
rights violations in the country, claiming that "only gentle criticism is
directed against a friendly government that is seen as a stabilizing  
force."While stability is a worthy goal, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki  
insists that it
is only possible when there is full respect for human rights.Copies of A  
Threat to Stability: Human Rights Violations in Macedonia," are

An Analysis of Domestic Legislation to Regulate the Activities ofLocal and

by

Edward A Adiin Yaansah

at a cost of UK St. stlg5.00 per copy: please add postage and packing ofUK  
St stlg1.00 per book; overseas UK St stlg2.00 per book

This book begins a discussion of great significance to the future
development of governments of the South and the new 'transition'
states of Europe. Many of these states are dependent on
international aid which is increasingly channeled through
non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This book examines
legislation introduced by four governments to regulate the
activities of NGOs operating within their territories - both foreign
and national. Identifying themselves as the voice of 'civil
society', in many countries, foreign and national NGOs have been
able to attract funding, which, in some cases,  means their combined
budgets are greater than those of the governments. As such, NGOs
have become a force to be reckoned with. This book makes a starting
point for real dialogue about relationships between government and
NGOs.

UNHCR AND MALAYSIA CLOSE CAMP
FOR VIETNAMESE BOAT-PEOPLE

	UNHCR and Malaysian authorites on
Tuesday closed Malaysias last camp for
Vietnamese boat-people, ending 21-years of
cooperation in which more than a
quarter-million  people transited the
country.

	Tuesdays ceremony at Sungei Besi
camp, near Kuala Lumpur, was  attended by
Malaysian Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah
Haji Ahmad Badawi and UNHCRs
Assistant High Commissioner, Sergio
Vieira de Mello.

	The ceremony marked the end of
Malaysias 21-year involvement with the
boat-people from Viet Nam. It occurred just
five days before the end of the
Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA), a
multi-national effort that was established in
1989 to stem the flow of asylum-seekers
who braved shark-infested waters and
pirate attacks to leave Viet Nam and Laos.
	The CPA established an alternative,
legal migration route out of Viet Nam,
permitting over half a million people to
depart by air. The ground-breaking
agreement also established screening
procedures under which the countries of
first asylum in South-East Asia individually
examined every asylum-seekers claim to
refugee status. Virtually all the refugees,
who had a well-founded fear of persecution
in their country of origin, were given
resettlement places in Western countries.
The screened-out, who could safely return
to their country, were expected to do so.
	UNHCR agreed to set up extensive
assistance programs for returnees in the
countries of origin, and monitored their
well-being and safety in accordance with
those countries commitments to give
returnees the same basic rights as every
other citizen. The agency also chaired the
CPAs Steering Committee, assisted with
care and maintenance in camps for
asylum-seekers, and helped set up refugee
status determination procedures.

	Since 1975, 840,000 Vietnamese
asylum-seekers have arrived in the
countries of South-East Asia and Hong
Kong. Over 755,000 departed for
resettlement in the West. Over 81,000 have
returned safely to Viet Nam.

	There are few happy moments in the
career of a refugee official, and this is one
of them, Vieira de Mello said at Tuesdays
ceremony. The CPA has been a model for
multilateral cooperation, built on the
principles of international solidarity,
burden-sharing, and proper acceptance of
responsibilities. Its purposes were to end
the ongoing tragedy on the high seas, and to
preserve asylum while reducing incentives
for further mass outflow. It has been
successful.

	At its latest meeting, in March 1996,
the CPA Steering Committee envisaged that
all Vietnamese non-refugees in the countries
of South-East Asia would repatriate prior to
the formal closure of the CPA. However, it
is estimated that some 24,700 people will
still be in camps after June 30, including
3,500 in Indonesia; 2,300 in the Philippines;
4,000 in Thailand; and 15,000 in Hong
Kong.

	As of June 30, in accordance with the
conclusions of the seventh Steering
Committee meeting, UNHCR will phase
down its care and maintenance activities in
South-East Asian countries of first asylum.
Transitional arrangements will be
implemented for the post-CPA residual
camp populations, and in the case of Hong
Kong, which has a much larger caseload
than other countries, UNHCR will maintain
its current status. UNHCR will also
continue to assist and monitor the situation
of people who return to Viet Nam.

	The first boat-people landed on the
east coast of Malaysia in May 1975. In all,
nearly 255,000 Vietnamese boat-people
were given temporary asylum in Malaysia,
where they were cared for by UNHCR, the
Malaysian authorities and the Malaysian
Red Crescent Society. A total 248,410 were
resettled in Western countries (some of
them children born in the camps), and over
9,000 returned to Viet Nam.

	At the height of the influx, Malaysia
had eight camps for boat-people, along the
East Coast and in Sabah and Sarawak. As
the wave of arrivals diminished, and as
more people were resettled in the West, the
remaining population was moved to Sungei
Besi.

LE HCR ET LA MALAISIE FERMENT
LE DERNIER CAMP DE BOAT PEOPLE


	Le Haut Commissariat des Nations
Unies pour les r#fugi#s et les autorit#s
malaisiennes ont ferm# mardi le dernier
camp de boat people vietnamiens, mettant
ainsi un terme # 21 ans de coop#ration au
cours de laquelle plus dun quart de million
de personnes ont transit# par ce pays.
	La c#r#monie a eu lieu dans le camp
de Sungei Besi, pr#s de Kuala Lumpur. Le
ministre des Affaires #trang#res malaisien
Datuk Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi et le
Haut Commissaire assistant Sergio Vieira
de Mello #taient pr#sents.
	La c#r#monie a marqu# la fin de la
pr#sence de boat people vietnamiens
pendant 21 ans sur le sol malaisien. Elle
sest d#roul#e exactement cinq jours  avant
la fin du Plan daction global (PAG) adopt#
en 1989 par la communaut# internationale
afin de r#duire le flux de demandeurs dasile
qui bravaient les requins et les pirates de la
mer de Chine pour fuir le Viet Nam et le
Laos.
	Gr#ce au PAG, plus dun demi-million
de personnes ont pu quitter l#galement le
Viet Nam. Le plan pr#voyait #galement des
proc#dures de d#termination du statut de
r#fugi# gr#ce auxquelles les pays de
premier asile dans lAsie du Sud-Est ont pu
examiner chaque demande
individuellement. Pratiquement tous les
r#fugi#s, qui craignaient avec raison la
pers#cution dans leur pays dorigine, ont #t#
r#install#s dans les pays occidentaux. Ceux,
dont les demandes #taient rejet#es et qui
pouvaient rentrer dans leur pays  en toute
s#curit#, #taient invit#s # le faire.
	Dans le cadre de ce plan, le HCR a
mis en marche dimportants programmes
daide et de surveillance pour les rapatri#s
dans les pays dorigine afin de sassurer,
entre autres, que leur bien-#tre et leur
s#curit# soient respect#s, en accord avec
les engagements pris par les autorit#s de
ces pays, cest-#-dire de reconna#tre aux
rapatri#s les m#mes droits quaux autres
citoyens. Le HCR pr#sidait #galement le
comit# directeur du PAG, fournissait aide
aux demandeurs dasile dans les camps et
participait # la mise au point des
proc#dures de d#termination du statut de
r#fugi#.
	Depuis 1975, sur les 840 000
demandeurs dasile vietnamiens dans les
pays de lAsie du Sud-Est, plus de 755 000
ont trouv# un pays de r#installation et plus
de 81 000 sont retourn#s en toute s#curit#
au Viet Nam.
	Les occasions de r#jouissance sont
rares dans la carri#re dun responsable du
HCR, mais ceci en est une, a d#clar# M.
Vieira de Mello au cours de la c#r#monie
de mardi. Le PAG a #t# un mod#le de
coop#ration multilat#rale, bas# sur les
principes de la solidarit# internationale, du
partage du fardeau et de lacceptation des
responsabilit#s de chacun. Son but #tait de
mettre un terme # la trag#die qui se
d#roulait en mer et de pr#server les
principes de lasile tout en essayant de
r#duire les motifs dexil. Cela a #t# un
succ#s.
	Au cours de la derni#re rencontre du
comit# directeur du PAG en mars 1996, il a
#t# d#cid# que tous les Vietnamiens non
reconnus comme r#fugi#s dans les pays de
lAsie du Sud-Est devaient retourner dans
leur pays avant la fermeture officielle du
PAG. On estime, toutefois, quenviron 24
700 personnes se trouveront encore dans les
camps apr#s le 30 juin, dont 3500 en
Indon#sie, 2300 aux Philippines, 4000 en
Tha#lande et 15 000 # Hong Kong.
	A partir du 30 juin, le HCR va r#duire
progressivement son programme
dassistance dans les pays de premier asile
de lAsie du Sud-Est. Des accords de
transition sont pr#vus pour assurer le suivi
du PAG concernant la population restante
dans les camps. En ce qui concerne Hong
Kong, o# le nombre de Vietnamiens dans
les camps est plus important que partout
ailleurs, le HCR conservera son statut
actuel. Le HCR va #galement poursuivre
son programme daide et de surveillance
pour les rapatri#s au Viet Nam.
	Les premiers boat people sont arriv#s
sur la c#te est de la Malaisie en mai 1975.
Au total, pr#s de 255 000 boat people
vietnamiens ont re#u lasile temporaire en
Malaisie et b#n#fici# de laide du HCR, des
autorit#s malaisiennes et de la Soci#t# du
Croissant-Rouge malaisienne. Au total, 248
410 personnes (dont des enfants n#s dans
les camps) ont #t# r#install#es dans les pays
de lOuest et pr#s de 9000 sont retourn#s au
Viet Nam.
	La Malaisie a eu jusqu# huit camps
pour les boat people sur la c#te est et dans
les Etats de Sabah et de Sarawak. Le
nombre des nouveaux arriv#s diminuant et
celui de la r#installation augmentant, la
population restante a pu #tre transf#r#e #
Sungei Besi.

CALL FOR NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF NGOs WORKING ON ISSUES RELATED TO  
MIGRATION AND/ORPROVIDING SERVICES TO MIGRANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES

The UN Population Division is preparing the annual report to the  
Commission onPopulation and Development.

I am a consultant researching and writing the chapter on NGO  activities  
related to theProgramme of Action in chapter 10 (Population Distribution,  
Urbanization and InternalMigration) of the report of the International  
Conference on Population and Development(Cairo 1994).

This chapter will include stastics and examples of NGO work with and for  
migrants andtheir family members. We hope to provide a broadly  
representative report on such NGOwork in all regions of the world,  
including local, national, regional and global NGOs.

Please send me the names and addresses of any NGOs that should  receive  
this survey.This includes not only NGOs working directly on migrant  
issues, but any NGOs that mayhave some programming in this area as part of  
their larger mandates.

Other comments, inquiries and suggestions are very welcome.

Thank you for your assistance,
	Sarah Stephens

Response to Information Request                     No:SOM9

Date: 24th June 1996

Subject: Somalia - information about the Bajun clan and their
possible persecution.
______________________________________________________________

     "The Bajuni are a small community of perhaps 3,000 or 4,000
who are predominantly sailors and fishermen. They live in small
communities along the Indian Ocean coastline and on some of the
larger offshore islands between Kismayu and Mombasa, Kenya. There
are also substantial numbers of families living in Kismayu, and
smaller numbers in Mogadishu and Brava" (Cassanelli, May 1995, p
19). According to Somalia. A Country Study, "partial geographical
isolation and an active ethnic consciousness distinguished by
differences in languages separate them from the Somalis" (p 80).
Mohamed and Stockman refer to the Banjuni as part of the Benadiriminority  
communities: "the small sea-faring Bajuni community of
Kismaio and the small islands off the coast" (1996, p 3).

     Cassanelli cites instances of armed militias stealing
equipment from the Bajuni and, although he suggests that "Bajuni
do not seem to have been targeted for personal or political
attack during the fighting [and] because of their maritime
mobility, they have not been in as much danger as other Somali
minorities", he concludes that "many impoverished Bajunis will
not be able to repatriate to Somalia with any promise of
security. Their ability to earn a living in Somalia may be at anend" (pp  
19,20). Earlier, he notes how Kismayu became a centre of
fighting between the major Somali clans following the overthrow
of Barre in 1991, and how the area continues to be unstable:
citing how small Bantu farmers were the most consistent victims
"with few guns and no organized militias of their own" (p 6).

     The general position of members of minority clans has been
described recently in a draft Minority Rights Group report by
Mohamed and Stockman, 1996: "members of Somalia's minority
communities .... have suffered disproportionately from the war
and from the lack of relief aid. As most of these communities
have not formed militias, they have been vulnerable to almost
continual warfare and occupation and are excluded from the
political process that might result in peace and the formation
of a new state structure", (p 1); "those outside the system,
including members of most minority groups are especially
vulnerable to attack" and "these groups have been marginalised in
a minority status because of their small numbers, low socio-political  
status, and weak military position" (p 3).
     The Quaker Committee for Refugees described the situation
for minority tribes thus:

     "When the Siad Barre regime fell in early 1991, the minority
     tribes were the only group in Somalia to be unarmed. As a
     result, they have been the most vulnerable group, and
     estimates of death in the minority tribes are in the
     hundreds of thousands. Not only were they unable to defend      
themselves against troops of various factions, their food
     and property were looted time and agian. The perception of
     the majority Somali tribes is that the minority tribes are
     non-Somali, and therefore are less than human. This hass
     led to human rights abuses and deaths on a massive scale" (p
     1).

     The analysis is repeated in Amnesty International's note of
15th February 1993.

Remarks by the
Deputy High Commissioner
Mr. Gerald Walzer

Meeting of the Standing Committee
UNHCR
25 June 1996


Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates,

	
	On behalf of the High Commissioner,
it is my privilege to join you at this meeting
of the Standing Committee.  The agenda for
our meeting over the next three days is a full
one, beginning with international protection.
 The Director of the Division of
International Protection will introduce this
year#s Note, which reviews UNHCR#s
efforts toward developing comprehensive
approaches for preventing and resolving
refugee problems.  The Note highlights the
framework of international protection
principles which, in addition to political
will, must be at the heart of any successful
comprehensive approach.  In some regions,
however, the gap has widened between the
protection principles which are supported
by a wide consensus of the international
community, and the actual  treatment which
refugees and asylum seekers receive on the
ground.  Whilst UNHCR is every day
acutely conscious of the great sacrifices that
many asylum countries are making and the
disproportionate burden carried by some,
we must reiterate our appeal for adherence
to the international protection principles,
particularly in respect of the principle of
non-refoulement and the granting of asylum.
 Mr. McNamara will elaborate on these
topics when he presents our reflections on
the annual Note and the protection issues
which are before you.

	 Mr. Chairman, I should like to devote
the short time that I have here this morning
to updating you on major developments
since mid-April, when the Standing
Committee last met.

	I begin with Africa, and it is with
deep sadness that I inform you of the tragic
death on the 24th of May in Nairobi of our
colleague, Mr. Peter Otieno Onginde, a
UNHCR driver who was killed during an
armed robbery while on duty.  Just a few
days later, on 4 June, three delegates of the
ICRC lost their lives in a brutal ambush in
northern Burundi.  These tragedies remind
us of the enormous dangers to which
humanitarian workers are exposed, and of
the need to take all possible steps to
maximize security for staff as they work to
protect and assist others.

	Although the Africa region constitutes
one of our main agenda items and the
Director of the Regional Bureau for Africa,
Mr. Kamel Morjane, will address this
Committee later in the meeting, I feel
compelled to sound an alarm about the
grave consequences with which we -- the
international community and UNHCR --
may soon be faced in the Great Lakes
region.  As you are aware, we have
appealed for US 288 million dollars for
humanitarian assistance in the Great Lakes
region for 1996.  This amount provides for
a limited budget for voluntary repatriation
and only the basic levels of protection and
assistance needed to sustain some 1.8
million people.  Already cut from this
budget were essential activities that had
been deferred from 1995.  UNHCR has so
far received US 110 million dollars against
this budget, all of which has been expended.

	The consequences of this severe
underfunding in the Great Lakes region are
clear, and the impact on the refugees, and on
Tanzania and Zaire, is apparent:

--sanitation systems are breaking down,
increasing the risk of disease;

--lack of firewood is causing a major
environmental disaster in refugee-hosting
regions;

--lack of replacements for trucks, which are
breaking down regularly, is seriously
hampering our logistics capacity and
contingency preparedness;

--lack of replacements for plastic sheeting,
most of which is nearly 2 years old and in
tatters, causes deteriorating health
conditions, particularly respiratory disease.

This lack of sufficient funding is causing
havoc in both our planning and monitoring
throughout the Great Lakes region, and we
now risk losing valued NGO partners who
have no assurance of UNHCR#s ability to
finance our programmes in the region.

	The overall situation is made worse
by the violence in Burundi, for which
precious emergency stocks must be
reserved in the event of further large-scale
forced population movements.  The
challenge increases with new arrivals on
the one hand and, with no quick solutions in
sight, the absence of large-scale repatriation
on the other.
	
	Mr. Chairman,

	I should like to make one other
comment on our collective approach to this
region.  Some commentators have suggested
that decreasing the levels of our
humanitarian assistance would deliver a
message to the refugees and that they will
consequently return home.  Cutting back
assistance may send a message, but from all
we know, many if not most of the refugees
will only disperse within their countries of
asylum, further increasing the strain on the
host countries, exacerbating the security
situation even further, and undermining
UNHCR#s ability to ensure international
protection and promote solutions.  On
behalf of the High Commissioner, I must
appeal urgently to all donors to adequately
support these programmes, whilst we
continue actively to promote voluntary
repatriation and, to the extent possible, seek
the relocation of camps away from
dangerous border areas.  Relocation of
camps is a temporary but urgently needed
measure while efforts continue to improve
conditions for return, and while
governments and the international
community work to solidify greater peace
and stability.

	Ernest Chipman, Head of the Fund
Raising Service, will provide further
details on funding

Subject: HRW: Former Yugoslavia--Letter Urging Arrest of War Criminals

27 June 1996--Over one hundred organizations and individuals in Europeand  
the United States today are calling upon the G-7 leaders nowmeeting in  
Lyons to ensure the immediate arrest of indicted warcriminals in the  
former Yugoslavia and their surrender to the Hague forprosecution.  The  
fact that the architects of the Bosnian slaughter,particularly Radovan  
Karadzic and Ratko Mladic continue freely to moveabout poisons the peace  
process, threatens the forthcoming electionsand undermines the authority  
of the Hague Tribunal.

Apprehension of indicted war criminals is absolutely required if the Dayton
agreement is to be saved and peace and democracy nourished in Bosnia.  The
European and American leadership that crafted the Dayton accords now should
combine to ensure that IFOR troops act to support the Tribunal by arresting
those indicted and transferring them to the Hague.

The full letter and list of signatories is attached.

H.E. Mr. Wim Kok
Prime Minister of the Netherlands
Binnenhof 20
P.O. Box 25001
2500 EA The Hague
The NETHERLANDS

                                                  June 27, 1996

Dear Prime Minister Kok:

On behalf of the 194 undersigned persons and organizations, we respectfully
call upon you to demonstrate the leadership needed to ensure the prompt arrest
of indicted war criminals in the former Yugoslavia and their surrender to the
Hague for prosecution.  As we approach the first anniversary of the Srebrenica
massacre, the men responsible for the killing and disappearance of some 8,000
Muslims enjoy not only freedom but power.  The continued presence in Bosnia of
Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and other indicted war criminals is poisoning
the peace process, threatening the forthcoming elections, and undermining the
authority and viability of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia.  Decisive action is urgently needed before the important advances
of the past year are lost.

There can be no question that the International Implementation Force (IFOR) is
fully authorized to provide active support to the Tribunal.  Security Council
Resolution 1031 charged IFOR with ensuring compliance with the Dayton
agreement, which includes a requirement that all parties cooperate with the
Tribunal.  Article 29 of the Tribunal's Statute sets forth the various forms
of cooperation that is due, including "the identification and location of
persons," "the arrest or detention of persons," and "the surrender or the
transfer of the accused to the International Tribunal."  Given the Serbian
authorities' utter lack of cooperation with the Tribunal, the task must fall
to IFOR to guarantee that this historic opportunity to bring genocidal killers
to justice is not squandered.

With the Bosnian government threatening to pull out of the elections if
Karadzic and Mladic are not apprehended and Chief Prosecutor Richard Goldstone
expressing increasing concern about the fate of the Tribunal without their
apprehension, securing the arrest and surrender of these two mass murderers
should be the Western government's top priority in Bosnia.  However, Western
leaders continue to block the use of IFOR troops to arrest indicted war
criminals.  While we understand your preoccupation with avoiding unnecessary
risk to IFOR, we are confident that the 60,000 IFOR troops in Bosnia, backed
by the finest equipment for intelligence gathering and rapid deployment, can
find a propitious time and place to seize these two fugitives.  Indeed, your
failure to bring these men to trial places many more lives at risk, in Bosnia
and elsewhere, by sending the signal that there is no price to be paid for
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, whether committed against
local civilians or international troops.

The failure of the international community to arrest Karadzic, Mladic and
other indicted war criminals is also having an increasingly corrosive effect
on the political situation in Bosnia.  The presence in office of the very
individuals responsible for massive abuses over the past four years has
assured that hundreds of thousands of refugees and internally displaced people
cannot return home and that political opportunities for anyone but hard-line
nationalists are sharply limited.  Freedom of the press and assembly is
severely limited, and violence against ethnic minorities and opposition
figures is on the rise.  National elections -- a key step in the peace process
-- cannot meaningfully take place so long as Karadzic and Mladic remain at
large.

Apprehension of indicted war criminals is absolutely required if the Dayton
agreement is to be saved and peace and democracy nourished in Bosnia. We
respectfully urge you to order the troops under your command to make an
immediate and urgent priority of locating these fugitives and identifying
circumstances when IFOR can arrest them on favorable terms.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

Subject: HRW: Czech Republic--Discrimination against Roma

For release June 28, 1996

The Czech government has failed to combat discrimination against Roma by state
officials as well as by private individuals, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki
charged today.  In Foreigners in Their Own Land, Human Rights Watch finds that
Roma suffer blatant discrimination, including violent attacks by "skinheads"
and other racist hate groups.  Since 1989, an estimated twenty-seven Roma have
died as a result of racially motivated violence in the Czech Republic. One
hundred and eighty-one attacks were recorded in 1995 alone.
The government has taken some commendable first steps to rectify the problem,
but they have not been enough to slow the trend.  Police are often sympathetic
to "skinheads," fail to make arrests or protect Roma under threat. When cases
do go to trial, the sentences are often light,  sending the message that these
crimes are not considered serious.

At the bottom of the social ladder, Roma face daily discrimination in housing,
education and employment.  They are often segregated in "special schools,"
denied residency permits and refused jobs, solely because of their  
ethnicity.
Since January 1993, Roma have been negatively affected by the Czech
citizenship law, which came into effect after the split of Czechoslovakia.  A
large number of Roma are now without Czech citizenship, even though they are
long-term or lifelong residents of the Czech Republic.  Some of them are now
stateless, others have been deported to Slovakia.  Evidence suggests that the
law was drafted with the specific intent of removing Roma from the  
country.
Overall the Czech record on human rights has been admirable since the fall of
the communist government in 1989.  But the otherwise laudable reforms of Czech
democracy have failed to ensure many basic human rights to the Roma  
minority.The effects of the citizenship law and the state's unwillingness  
to combat
racist violence reveal an undeniable pattern of discrimination along ethnic
lines.

<h1>MiniWorks 4pole</h1>
<hr>
Without a doubt, no other synthesizer component has
such a decisive effect on sound quality as does the filter.
All of us at Waldorf, and of course the owners of
Microwaves and Waves, know all about the exceptional
qualities of our analog filters. We obviously would like all
musicians to have the chance to access this quality
component, so we simply impIemented it as a separate
module. The 4-Pole is the legendary MicroWave/Wave
24 dB lowpass filter. You are free to apply this filter to
any audio signal that you manage to patch into the
device via a 1/4" jack. So if your favourite sampler or
sampleplayer lacks that special quality, you can give it a
sonic boost via the 4-Pofe. It is the most powerful (and
quite possibly the only) analog filter available today. You
can also position the incoming signal anywhere you
want within a stereo mix via the integrated stereo
amplifier (VCA). Filtering and panorama positions may
also be modulated via envelopes, MIDI events and audio
signals.

<h1>Powerplay HA 4000</h1>
<h2>4-Channel Stereo High-Power Headphone System</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>For dramatically improving Headphone monitoring in studios
<li>4 High-power Stereo Amplifiers
<li>For feeding individual cue mixes to recording artists
<li>For more flexible on-stage monitoring from FOH mixers
<li>Drives up to 12 headphones directly: no separate power amps required
<li>Line outputs also included for power amplifiers
</ul>
<hr>

<h4>The POWERPLAY is our answer
to artists who complain to the
engineer about their headphone
mix. With the HA 4000 you will
vastly improve the cue monit-
oring in your studio, earning
praise from musicians and
vocalists who will really be able
to appreciate being able to hear
themselves the way they want.</h4>
<hr>
<h3>Additional Aux Inputs</h3>

The Behringer POWERPLAY is a
superb-quality unit which
contains four high-power FCA
(Floating Current) amplifiers.
Four independent stereo
headphone channels are
provided, each with a Level
control, a separate Aux Input plus
a Mix control. This means that
artists can not only set their own
desired individual headphones
volume, but can also set the
volume of their own performance
in their Cue mix. How often have
you had that request!
<hr>
<h3>Triple-Connectivity</h3>

It is envisaged that the
POWERPLAY will be rack-
mounted in your control room,
driving your studio headphones
distribution network. For when
you, the engineer, want to pre-
monitor what's going on in your
artists' cans, we have thoughtfully
provided front panel stereo
headphones jacks in addition to
the two jacks on the rear panel.
<hr>
<h3>The Direct Input</h3>
Sometimes you will want to send a
signal into the artists headphones
that over-rides the normal stereo
Main Input on the back panel.
A typical situation might occur
when you want to play back
some pre-recorded music from,
say, a CD player. A front panel
Input Jack, with its own Level
control, lets you do just that.
<hr>
<h3>Matrix Switch</h3>

Instead of running the main mix
cue feed in stereo, you could use
two completely separate mixes,
fed from your mixing console's
Aux buses. Each headphone
channel has a Switching Matrix,
enabling selection of monitoring
Modes. In Mono Mode each
artist can blend their own
personal headphones or live
monitor mix form three sources:
bus 1 (L), bus 2 (R) and their own
individual Aux Input.
<hr>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Four stereo high-power FCA's (Floating Current Amplifiers)
<li>Highest sonic quality even with extremely high volume levels
<li>Each stereo amp drives up to 12 headphones sets (>100 Ohms)
<li>Three output jack connectors per channel
<li>Front and rear connections for easy pre-monitoring
<li>Mono/Stereo switch for each channel
<li>Left/Right Mute switch for each channel
<li>Separate Line Outputs to chain several POWERPLAYs
<li>Stereo Main Input (Two assignable Mix inputs in Mono Mode)
<li>Four independent stereo Aux Inputs, one per channel
<li>Individual blend of Mix/Aux per channel
<li>Additional Direct Input
</ul>

<h1>Quadraverb 2</h1>
<h2>The Room to Be In</h2>
<hr>
The Q2 Dual Channel Octal Processing Master Effects with Digital
I/0 is the new flagship of the award-winning Alesis effects processing
line. It was created with a very specific purpose in mind: to make a
single processor that offers the sonic quality of a high-end primary
vocal reverb unit while providing extremely powerful multieffects
capabilities.
<p>
Q2's architecture was designed to provide an inherent ease of use
that allows you to access its tremendous power without becoming
confused by intricate programming. And due to its advanced internal
processor and extremely innovative software, Q2 is better sounding,
more technologically advanced and more versatile than any Alesis
effects processor to date.
<p>
When its time to record vocals, you can't settle for anything less than
master-quality reverb. World-class studios have been aware of this
for a long time, and many of them dedicate a large portion of their
equipment budget to reverb units that provide the pristine sonic quality
necessary for professional vocal recording. This is their primary
reverb...the one they turn to when the only option is perfection.
<p>
Many of Q2's programs were developed with the assistance of industry
pros who know what it takes to get the ultimate vocal reverb sound.
They know that the human voice, with its wide dynamic range and
variety of tonal content, is the acid test of a great reverb. Reverb that
sounds great on the vocals will sound
incredible on drums, guitar, keys
or anything else.
<p>
Q2 also provides the program
ming power to fine tune your
programs with meticulous detail.
Each reverb algorithm offers advanced parameters only found in the
most expensive dedicated studio reverbs and yet Q2 is uncommonly
affordable. Q2's Large Plate algorithm provides standard parameters
like Decay, Diffusion and Predelay, but also includes features like
Reverberation Swirl, which adds a great stereo chorus-like effect to
the output of the reverb. On the Plate 2 algorithm, parameters like
Reflection Level and Spread allow you to control the amplitude and
density of early reflections to create extremely realistic space and
depth for vocal tracks, pianos and orchestral instruments.
<p>
A great vocal reverb like the Q2 offers all the professional performance specs you need. 
<ol>
<li>Flat frequency response from 20Hz to 20kHz.
<li>Dynamic range over 92dB (A-weighted).
<li>Total distortion less than 0.005% at peak level.
<li>Crosstalk better than 90dB.
<li>Specs like these are typical of the world's most elite signal processing gear.

<hr>
<h3>Mix Snapshots</h3>
Until now, the only way to store mix settings was with marker pen and masking tape.  ProMix 01
"Snapshots" change all that.  They allow you to store and recall all mix settings instantly with just one press
of a button, or MIDI Program Change command.  And it's not just mutes and faders, it's all mix settings.
<h3>MIDI Automation</h3>
Simply connecting ProMix 01 to a MIDI sequencer provides total mix automation.  Allowing you to listen
to your mix while difficult moves are performed for you, repeatedly and precisely.  All parameters can be
MIDI controlled.
<h3>Internal Effects</h3>
Two Yamaha digital multi-effects are built-in for a sonic edge.  Of course, all effects settings are stored as
part of your mix.
<h3>Dynamics Processors</h3>
Three stereo digital dynamics processors, which can be assigned to input channels, aux sends, and stereo
outputs, provide compression, limiting, gating, and ducking.  Once again, all settings are stored as part of
your mix.
<h3>Digital Output</h3>
Once digitized by the Yamaha 20-bit A/D converters, there's no point converting back to analog.  That's
why ProMix 01 features an S/PDIF digital output for direct mixdown to DAT and other digital recorders.
<h3>Easy-to-Learn Interface</h3>
Anyone who has used a conventional analog mixing console will have no trouble driving the ProMix 01. 
The large backlit graphic LCD provides clear indication of mix settings and graphic display of EQ curves. 
A feature not available on analog consoles.
<h3>Parametric EQ with Library</h3>
Input channels, effect returns, and stereo outputs all feature three-band fully parametric EQ.  In addition, a
library of unique EQ presets designed for specific applications and instruments are provided.  You can also
add your own custom EQ settings to the library and recall them at any time.
<h3>Motorized Faders</h3>
Motorized faders are featured on all channels, and four fader groups are provided for multichannel control.
<h3>Superb Performance</h3>
ProMix 01 features 20-bit AD/DA converters with 64times A/D oversampling and 8-times D/A
oversampling.  Internal signal processing is 24-bit, 36-bit for EQ.  Dynamic range is in excess of 100dB.
<h3>Application Diversity</h3>
ProMix 01 with memory offers a powerful edge for studio, live sound, and commercial installation applica
tions.  ProMix 01 is ideal for the gigging band, or as a submixer to a larger console.  In the studio, ProMix
01 manages keyboard and multitrack mixing with finesse.  ProMix 01 with memory is the ideal mixer for
use with hard disk recorders. Snapshots and moving-fader automation make it ideal for complex situations
where mix settings must be recalled repeatedly and precisely.
<h3>Cost Performance</h3>
<b>ProMix 01 breaks the price/performance barrier, offering all the essential mixing tools, plus memory and
automation of all settings.  Motorized faders, internal effects, and on-board dynamic processors provide
mixing power you couldn't imagine-at a price you won't believe.</b>

<hr>
<h3>PROMIX 01 ADVANTAGES FOR LIVE PERFORMANCES</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Memory</b> - ProMix 01 Snapshots make night after night sound-checks a breeze.  Simply press recall to
return to the previous night's settings of levels, EQ, and all controls.  You will wonder how you ever lived
without MEMORY.
<li><b>Two internal effects processors</b> - can be dynamically routed from tune to tune, so its like having more than
two processors.  No patching simplifies set up.  Of course, effects settings are stored along with the rest of
the mix.
<li><b>EQ library</b> - save and recall EQ curves for particular performers, microphones, and instruments.  The
Library lets you apply them to any channel of your mix at any time.
<li><b>16 balanced MIC/Line inputs</b> - handle any combination of acoustic and electric instruments.  Phantom
power on eight XLR inputs allows you to use those hot condenser mics.
<li><b>Stereo input</b> - use this to chain multiple mixers, return an outboard effect, or connect a CD player for music
during the breaks.
<li><b>Stereo digital and analog record jacks</b> - record your performance to DAT or analog cassette.
<li><b>Three stereo dynamics processors</b> - choose from a library of gates, limiters, and compressors, with
<"ducking" feature.  Gate the vocal mic when the soloist is playing using the built in "key" feature. 
Store custom performer settings in the Library and use them night after night.
<li><b>Three-band fully parametric EQ</b> - gets you out of a tight jam, reduces feedback, and adds sparkle to
guitars and vocals.  Stereo EQ on the stereo output bus eliminates the need for an external room
equalizer.
<li><b>Two external aux sends</b> - give you two additional monitor or effect mixes.  Of course, these mixes can
be stored and changed instantly from tune to tune.
<li><b>20-bit AD/DA converters</b> - provide the headroom required for the most demanding live sound
applications.
<li><b>Large backlit LCD display</b> - shows you metering of all inputs, EQ curves, compressor/gate action, and
more!  Even in the dark.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>PROMIX 01 ADVANTAGES FOR MIXDOWN APPLICATIONS</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Memory</b> - when working on several tunes or several projects, store a separate snapshot of mixer settings (including EQ, level, pan, and effects, etc.) for each tune in each project. Total and instant recall of all mix settings frees you to leave a project and come back to it at any time, picking up exactly where you left off.
<li><b>Automation</b> - when connected to a MIDI sequencer, Promix 01 remembers all your moves. Difficult mixes become simple as ProMix 01 performs the difficult moves for you over and over, leaving you free to adjust your mix to perfection. With ProMix 01 you can automate not just fader levels, but all your moves, including effect sends, EQ changes and panning - even changes in the effects.
<li><b>EQ library</b> - once you have found EQ that works for you, store your custom EQ curves in the Library and apply them to any channel of your mix at any time.
<li><b>Two internal effects processors</b> - take advantage of 30 preset effects in each! Internal effects eliminate the expense of outboard units, and are more powerful. Effects and effects send can be assigned and modified via automation, allowing you to change effects whenever you want, in a single mix.
<li><b>Three assignable stereo dynamics processors</b> - these give you dynamic control and gating of difficult
signal sources.  Processors can be reassigned mid-mix to any channel, aux send, and even the stereo
bus to put extra "punch" in your mix.  Processors can be "keyed" off any channel or the stereo bus, for
extensive creative control.
<li><b>Three-band fully parametric EQ</b> - offers unprecedented sound shaping control.  Via automation, EQ
can be changed mid-mix to enhance a particular section, and then returned to its original settings.
<li><b>Digital output</b> - for a sonic edge, send your finished mix directly to DAT without leaving the digital
realm.
<li><b>20-bit AD/DA converters</b> - provide crystal clear sonic performance, with dynamic range exceeding
that of today's digital multitrack and DAT recorders.

<h1>Autoquad XR 2400</h1>
<h2>Interactive Frequency-Conscious 4-channel Expander/Gate at the Top of its Class</h2><hr>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Live and in the studio
<li>Attenuates noise during pauses in programme material
<li>Creative envelope shaping
<li>For Auto-muting stage and conference microphones
<li>For reducing crosstalk between adjacent mics
<li>Great for the difficult task of drum kit mic separation
<li>Use wherever rack space is at a premium
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>4 Channels of Frequency-
Conscious Gating in
1U Rack Space!</h3>
Quad gates are not new.
However, condensing 4
frequency-conscious gates into
1U of rack space without
compromising functionality or
performance is! The AUTOQUAD
is a precision device taking full
advantage of the new Behringer
IQ Technology, combining
ease of operation with
incredibly powerful and
flexible dynamic control.
<hr>
<h3>Auto Mode: The Interactive
Expander
</h3>
The interactive control over
attack and release times is the
AUTOQUAD's most outstanding
feature. In AUTO mode the gate
becomes an expander. Attack
time and expansion ratio are
derived from a continuous
analysis of your programme
material, eliminating the usual
problems of clicks, pops, and
breathing, even with signals at
or near the noise floor.
<hr>
<h3>UTR (Ultra Transient
Response) Gate Circuit</h3>

Very fast attack times are
necessary if transient signals are
to be preserved. Other gates
can cut off the leaning edge of
percussive sounds, losing the
'kick', muffling the sound. With
the Auto function switched off,
the expander action is
displaced by an ultra fast gate.
<hr>
<h3>IHC (Interactive Hold
Control) Circuit</h3>

It is beneficial to have a Hold
element in the dynamic
envelope of a gate for maximum
operational stability. Our IHC
circuit automatically applies a
Hold element, depending on the
Release time chosen.
This interactive correlation
between Hold and Decay
provides an extremely natural
fade characteristic.
<hr>
<h3>Flexlink System</h3>

Any channel of the
AUTOQUAD can be linked to
its immediate neighbour. Thus
the AUTOQUAD can operate in
any configuration, eg. two true
stereo gates, one stereo and two
mono gates, or even as a three-
or four-way linked gate.
<hr>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>4 separate ultra-fast Gates
<li>Ultra-fast Attack
<li>Innovative Flexlink allows for any master/slave(s) set-up
<li>80 dB attenuation (max)
<li>Switchable IRC Expander eliminates clicks, chattering
<li>IHC circuit for musical fades
<li>Precision High- and Low-pas Key Filters with Listen switch
<li>Lucid 'Traffic Light' level/threshold LED display
<li>Servo-balanced Inputs and Outputs
<li>XLR and Jack Connectors
<li>Relay-controlled Hard-bypass with Auto-bypass during power-down (failsafe relay)
</ul>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Ultrafex II EX 3100</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<BODY BACKGROUNDCOLOR="ffffff" TEXT="#000000"  background="http://www.knooppunt.be/~hit_run/caerts/logoback.gif">
<img align=right src="http://www.knooppunt.be/~hit_run/caerts/behring.gif">

<h1>ULTRAFEX II EX 3100</h1>
<h2>Multiple Sound Enhancement Processor at the Top of its Class</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improves presence and transparency
<li>Improves intelligibility
<li>Improves and widens spatial image even beyond the speakers
<li>Produces more powerful, fuller bass
<li>Increases subjective volume level
<li>Reduces listening fatigue
</ul>
<hr>

<h4>Upon its arrival the ULTRAFEX II
caused a sensation. It is now
one of the world's best-selling
enhancers, used by renowned
PA hire companies and
recording studios. It has been
developed out of our many
years of research and
development in the field of
psychoacoustic processing.</h4>
<hr>
<h3>The Behringer 'Natural
Sonic' Processor</h3>

The upper-frequencies
processor has two controls per
channel. 'Tune' alters the high
pass filter cut-off determining
how much of the spectrum is
to be processed. 'High Mix'
sets the degree of processing
required. Our Natural Sonic
Processor continuously
optimises the ratio of
Enhancement to Excitation to
your signal, maximizing the
impact of the ULTRAFEX II on
your music.
<hr>
<h3>Integrated Noise Reduction System</h3>
As Exciters and Enhancers process higgh frequencies, so they must inevitably increase system noise. To counter this we have included our sliding-filter single-ended Noise Reducion system, which completely removes all audible hiss generated by the exciter/enhancer side-chain, while leaving your valuable original signal totally unaffected.<hr>
<h3>Integrated Bass Processor</h3>
The ULTRAFEX II comes with a separate Bass Processor for low frequency enhancement, with variable process amount and switchable (50/100 Hz) corner frequency.<hr>
<h3>Surround Processor</h3>
The fact that hearing impression largely depends on the positioning of the
instruments within the stereo
field is often neglected.
Therefore, we have integrated
an adjustable Surround
Processor in the ULTRAFEX II,
which is able to dramatically
improve the intensity of the
spatial stereo effect. Your
programme material gains in
liveliness, 'depth' and
transparency. As in a cinema or
theatre system, you have the
impression that the orchestral
instruments are placed all
around you. The Surround
Processor enlarges your stereo
basis dependent upon the
programme material without
colouring the sonic image.
<hr>
<h3>Solo Mode</h3>
Unique to Behringer, the
ULTRAFEX II's Solo function
permits you to audition the
pure process only. Solo (effect
only) mode also permits
patching of the ULTRAFEX II
into any mixer's Aux Send and
Return loop, enabling
individual channel control of
the enhancement process.
<hr>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Professional and multi-application sound enhancement system
<li>Releases the untapped resources of any recording and instrument
<li>Unique Natural Sonic processor for unsurpassed sound improvement
<li>Built-in Noise Reduction system
<li>Multiband concept for bass power and high frequency transparency
<li>Bass Enhancer produces incredible bass sounds
<li>Surround Processor creates real spatial enhancement
<li>No decoding needed during reproduction
<li>ALC (Automatic Level Control)
<li>Servo-balanced Inputs and Outputs
<li>XLR and Jack Connectors
<li>Relay-controlled Hard-bypass with Auto-bypass during power-down (failsafe relay)

<h2>MIDI, SCORE AND AUDIO IN ALL PRO-LEVELS OF CUBASE</h2>
<b>With Cubase 3.0 you can record digital audio as if it were MIDI data; audio recordings are displayed and handled just like MIDI data, with the same tools used to cut, glue, move & erase parts!<br>
Cubase 3.0 has many dedicated audio features ranging from non-destructive editing to the 'Audio Pool' library window and integrated fast time stretch & pitch shift!</b>
<hr>
<h3>ARRANGE WINDOW</h3>...is Steinberg's often copied but never surpassed interface. Shape your songs in real time. Fully interactive! Want to move something? Then move it. Just point, drag and drop. To cut a phrase in two, use the scissors - to join, use the glue tube! All the tools are found in the Toolbox - just one mouse click away.<br>
The Arrange Window takes the guesswork out of song construction. Trying an idea is easy, and you can always 'Undo' if it doesn't work out. You can be as linear or as pattern-oriented as you please - Cubase won't cramp your style. You can always see what's going on. What you see is what you hear. Cubase is clear simple, and always intuitive.
<hr>
<h3>NOTATION</h3>Cubase represents the definitive answer to the question of integrated MIDI recording and Score printing. From free-form lay-out to a full orchestral score, there is barely a need for a seperate scoring application. A dedicated notation font is included free.<br>
Despite its power, the scoring environment is designed in exactly the same way as Cubase; clear, transparent and always intuitive to use!
<hr>
<h3>GROOVE!</h3>
The heart & soul of a song is the feel. Sequencers never had a reputation for capturing a musician's natural feel - Steinberg changed all that. With the Cubase 'Groove Quantize', you can create custom rhythm templates of any length that let your music Groove! But that's just the start: Choose between six types of non-destructive quantize. And you can always undo the quantization to re-capture the original feel - even after saving your work!
<hr>
<h3>ADVANCED AUDIO PROCESSING</h3>
Cubase 3.0 for Windows can now fully utilise the amazing power of Steinberg's WaveLab.<br>
Double clicking an audio waveform takes you directly into WaveLab and lets this super-fast, true 32-bit Windows 95 powerhouse get to work on your audio recordings.<p>
WaveLab offers the fastest waveform drawing and scrolling in its class. You won't be waiting around to zoom a waveform to perform precise sample-accurate edits. And WaveLab is definitely no mono-tasking spoil-sport, you really are editing the audio while it is playing.<p>
WaveLab has an armoury of tools to get to work on the audio. All have powerful presets ready to use, or create your own parameter settings for extra control. Fades and crossfades are just a mouse move away, the presets handle most jobs, efoortlessly. Or try the compressor/Limiter, out of the box it is a general purpose musical tool. Use another preset and it is a mean and dirty guitar pumper-upper! Other tools include powerful equalisation options. WaveLab has fully parametric EQs ready to swing into action, all with a simple to understand interface, and a uniquely musician friendly aspect. These equalisers allow you to home in on the music and make changes with confidence.
<hr>
<h3>AUDIO PROCESSING TOOLS</h3>
Cubase 3.0 includes a complete set of audio processing tools from level optimization to time & pitch correction.<p>
<h4>Time & Pitch Correction</h4>
Steinberg's Time Bandit is fast becoming an industry standard for the best time correction available on Mac. This quality is now available - from within Cubase 3.0 for Windows. The interface is intuitive - the results are awesome! Time & Pitch correction can even be performed simultaneously.<p>
<h4>Varispeed</h4>
Introducing Varispeed - a great function that simulates the effect you get when changing the speed of a tape machine.<p>
<h4>Normalize</h4>
The essential tool for level optimization of your recordings.<p>
<h4>Reverse</h4>
The 'classic' effect which springs to mind immediately when it gets to sampling and digital recording.<p>
<h4>Equalization & Mix automation (only supported in Cubase Audio XT 3.0)</h4>
Total recall is a reality with Cubase Audio XT 3.0 for Windows: From flipping fader to EQ-control, it's entirely in your hands! All settings are non-destructive and do not change the audio on your drive. The EQ functionality is hardware dependent and available on Session 8 and CBX D5 only.<hr>
<h3>THE MIDI EDITORS</h3>
All Cubase editors are fully real-time! This gives another level of detail without imposing limitations. Our editors are also fully-featuredrecording environments. All changes are easily undoable. You can even undo a whole series of edits, not just the last one - hit the 'escape' button and the original music will be restored. A truly unique Cubase feature.
<h4>Key Edit</h4> is a fast, intuitive piano-roll editor, with additional graphic editing of controller data. Song Positions can be displayed as bars and beats or as time code. Specialized tools work directly on your recordings.
<h4>List Edit</h4> is a unique marriage of a traditional list-editor with Cubase's event based graphics, plus additional graphic editing of velocity or other controller data.
<h4>Drum Edit</h4> is a dedicated editor for rhythmic work. Display each drum sound by name, note & MIDI channel. With the unique 'Drum Map' feature you assign any keyboard key to any MIDI note on any MIDI channel. It's a matter of seconds to re-map a song from one drum source to another. A collection of preset templates is included free.
<h4>Score Edit</h4> displays MIDI data as real notes. A wealth of settings lets you decide how you want the MIDI data shown. This is a real editor with comprehensive tools, not merely a 'convert-to-note-picture' function. You edit using the standard Cubase toolbox. All changes are immediately reflected in the MIDI output. Switching to 'Page Mode' will open up a whole new world of professional scoring possibilities to you.

<h1>S-SERIES SAMPLERS</h1>
<hr>
<h2>The defining factor at the heart of every sampler is sound quality. Continuing in the tradition of
previous "S" Series samplers, the new Akai S3200XL, S3000XL and S2000 all feature
unsurpassed audio performance. Starting with 64-times-oversampling stereo sampling, the "S" Series samplers use 28-bit
internal processing to preserve every nuance of your sound.
Outputs are 18- and 20-bit to ensure reproduction of your sound's entire dynamic range.
Nothing unwanted is added.
Nothing unwanted is taken away.
The result is that Akai samplers become transparent, removing all barriers between you and
your creative vision.</h2>
<hr>
<h2>New Functions of XL Series and S2000:</h2>
The latest generation of the "S" Series samplers adds power, flexibility and expandability. Incorporating all the capabilities that have made the S3000 series the world standard for professional sampling, the new S3200XL and S3000XL add features like a powerful Multi Mode for ease of layering and multitimbral sequencing. Like a Multi-effects card that provides four independent channels of studioquality digital effects. Like RAM expansion with readily available SIMM memory. Like optional Flash Memory boards that allow you to store your favorite programs, ready to play immediately upon power up.
<h2>New MultiMode:</h2>
<p>
Akai's new MultiMode makes it easier than ever to set up your sampler for multitimbral
sequencing.  A Multisetup provides 16 "Parts," each of which can be assigned a different Program and can be set to respond to a different MIDI channel.  Each Part also has its own Level,
Pan, Tuning, Transposition, Output Routing and Effects Send (with EB16 Multieffects
processor board).  This allows one Program to be optimized in different ways for different
sequences without the need to copy and modify the original Program.
Each Part can also be assigned a Voice Priority (Low, High, Norm or Hold).  In the event that
a complex sequence exceeds the sampler's polyphony, this lets you ensure that important
Parts are never "stolen" by less important Parts. Most importantly, Multi Mode allows you to
edit the Multi setup while a sequence is running, so you can immediately hear the effect of any
changes in the context of all of the Parts.
<p>
<h2>Powerful intelligent functions are prepared as standard.
Standard MiDi files (S.M.F) enabling you to playback sequence data in S.M.F. format and of
course, digital EQ functions are available.</h2>
<p>
Our three digital samplers-the S3200XL, S3000XL and S2000- each come equipped with
16MB (S3200XL) and 2MB (S3000XL, S2000) of internal memory and a built-in SCSI
interface.  A second LSI, standard with the S32OOXL, is available as an option (IB-304F) for
the S3000XL and S2000, which makes it as powerful as the S32OOXL, with second filtering
and reverb capabilities.  Standard MIDI files (SMF) support both Format 0 and 1, enabling you
to play back sequence data in S.M.F. format (data created using MS-DOS sequence
software).
Digital equalizer functions offer four modes: Low Shelf, Band Wide, Band Thin and Hi Shelf. 
And you can re-sample as you equalize sampled data.
<p>
<h2>New Multi-Effects:</h2>
<p>
All three new samplers allow installation of Akai's new EB16 Multi-effects processor.  The
EB16 is a true four-channel, studio quality effects processor which offers two multi-effects
channels with up to six simultaneous effects each and two additional reverb channels.
The multi-effects channels provide distortion, EC, ring modulation, a choice of modulation
effects that includes chorus, phasing, flanging, pitch shifting and rotary speaker emulation, as
well as echo/delay and reverb.  The reverbonly channels add two additional reverbs for a total
of four independent reverbs. All EB16 effects are extensively editable and custom multi-
effects configurations can be stored in 50 effects presets.  An additional 50 presets are
reserved just for reverbs. Although the EB16 can add spectacular effects to single programs,
its true power becomes evident when it is used in Multi Mode.  Here it is configured as four
processors, each with its own effects bus.  Each Multi Mode Part can be routed, with its own
independent send level, to one of the processors.  In this way, an entire multitimbral
composition, complete with mix and effects, can be executed entirely in the digital domain and
routed through the digital outputs directly to DAT or to an Akai digital disk recorder.  With the
EB16, the new samplers truly function as a digital studio in a single box.
<p>

<h2>With the S2000, Akai establishes a new standard of value in professional sampling
technology.</h2>
<p>

The S2000 offers the same superb audio quality and programming power of the S3000
Series with a new streamlined, easy-to-use interface.  But that's just the beginning.  Despite
its amazingly low price, the S2000 includes a SCSI interface as standard, so you can connect
an external hard drive or CD ROM drive without having to buy an extra upgrade kit, The S2000
also includes Akai's MESA soft ware. which allows graphic programming and library
management from the screen of a Macintosh computer.
And unlike many other low-priced samplers, you won't easily outgrow your S2000.  As your
needs grow, your S2000 is designed to grow right along with them. If you need extra outputs,
the optional IB-208P board gives you no less than eight additional analog outputs along with
S/PDIF digital 1/0.  Need more sound processing power?  The IB 304F board adds an
additional digital filter bank with lowpass, highpass and bandpass response as well as digital
EQ and a third en velope generator.
And like the S3000XL and S3200XL, the S2000 accepts the EB16 Multi Effects board, up to
16 Megabytes of non-volatile Flash Memory (V1.3-) and up to 32 Megabytes of SIMM RAM. 
Of course, the S2000 is compatible with the world-renowned Akai sound library as well as
Roland, and E-mu CD ROM libraries.
<p>

<h2>APM: flexible manipulation of acoustic samples</h2>
<p>

APM (Assignable Program Modulation) lets you choose any modulation source (modwheel,
pitch bend, aftertouch, velocity, key position, LF01, LF02, envelope 1, envelope 2, definable
external MIDI controller) to any control input (filter cut off frequency, LFO rate, LFO depth,
amplitude, pitch and pan position).  This adds to the flexibility when editing samples of
acoustic instruments. For example, you can route the modwheel to open the filter in a brass
program for swells and growls.  And you can route aftertouch to control the panning's LFO
speed to emulate the sound of a rotary speaker speeding up and slowing down in a classic
rock organ sound.
<p>

<h2>Flexible envelope generators combine with resonant Filters for versatile program editing</h2>
<p>

In program editing, you can assemble your samples for playback.  When you do, you can split
a keyboard into a number of "keygroups" and allocate up to four samples to a keygroup for
effects such as layering, velocity switching and fading and stereo sample playback.
Overlapping and crossfading makes transition from one keygroup to another smooth and
natural. In a keygroup, the sample may be passed through resonant filters for tonal
modification to create a sound similar to an analogue synthesizer. Moreover, the S3200XL
has a second LSI which includes other types of resonant filters such as High Pass, Band
Pass, Low Pass, etc.  With this LSI, you can create some very interesting synth sounds.
You can also apply modulation from two LFOs (Low Frequency Oscillators) with three wave-
forms (triangle, sawtooth and square), for vibrato, tremolo and filter modulation.  Mono legate
emulates the styling and phrasing of solo instruments such as flute and oboe, to give each
sample more expressive power, It also replicates a monosynth bass and lead lines.
In addition to a standard ADSR envelope generator (ENV1), there is a second (ENV2) with
eight rate and level parameters.  Together they permit fine tuning in creating new sounds as
well as old classic sounds.  For your convenience, there are a total of 25 preset envelope
templates which you can directly access and fine adjust if need be.  They include PIANO. 
ELECTRONIC ORGAN, STRINGS/VOX, BRASS, SHORT PERCUSSION, DRY DRUM,
SYNTH BASS, INVERT FILTER, SWELL ATTACK, RISE RELEASE, etc.
<p>

<h2>Direct recording on hard disk</h2>
<p>

With the S3200XL and S3000XL, you can directly record and play back a sample on a hard
disk or an MO disk. The random access capability of a hard disk comes in handy especially
when editing samples.  You can easily cut the start or end of a sample, change pitch, make
copies, control MIDI notes and play back on the internal clock or in sync with an external
SMPTE time code, tasks that would be time-consuming with a tape machine. Moreover, while
you record and play samples, you still retain access to the versatile functions of the sampler,
so you can add live vocals or guitar sounds during automatic play from a sequencer.  Both
sampled data and direct recordings can coexist on the disk side by side.
<p>

<h2>New Options:</h2>
<p>

<h3>Ready to expand with your needs.</h3>
As powerful as the "S" Series samplers are in their basic configurations, they have been
designed to be expanded to meet the requirements of many specific applications. The S2000
can add 8 analog outputs and S/PDIF digital 1/0 with the IB-802P. Both the S2000 and the
S3000XL can be expanded with theEB16Multi-Effectsprocessor, the IB-304F Filter Bank and
up to 8MB of Flash Memory.  The S3000XL can additionally be equipped with an internal
524MB hard drive.  The S3200XL already comes standard with the EB16 and IB304F as well
as a SMPTE reader/generator, AES/EBU and S/PDIF digital 1/0 and 16MB of RAM. 
Expansion options include Flash Memory and an internal hard disk or 650 MB
Magneto/Optical drive.
<p>

<h2>"M.E.S.A."</h2>
<p>

<h3>While Akai samplers have long been known for their ease-of-operation, today, many people
use their samplers in a Macintosh-based environment and have expressed a desire to control
and program their samplers from the Macintosh screen.  For those people, we have
developed the Modular Editing System by Akai (M.E.S.A.).
The M.E.S.A. program is supplied free with the S2000, S3000XL and the S3200XL.</h3>
<p>

At its most basic level, M.E.S.A. allows graphic editing of every parameter in the new "S" Series
samplers.  The program comes with a variety of pre-configured control layouts so that you can be
up and running immediately.  M.E.S.A. also includes a versatile Layout Editor that lets you design
custom control layouts optimized for the exact way you work.
However, M.E.S.A. is much more than just a graphic editor.  With M.E.S.A. you can move sound
files between multiple incompatible machines (e.g., an S2000 sampler, a digital recorder and a
Macintosh) by translating the various custom audio file formats into the AIFF and SD2 standards. 
In this way, for example, a portion of a DD1000 track could be translated and loaded into an
S2000 where it could be edited using the S2000's sample editing tools, and then translated back
to the DD1000.  This function will be completed by software version-up in the near future.
M.E.S.A. also includes a File Manager for saving, organizing and accessing sound data on a
variety of external storage devices and a graphic Wave Editor for editing sound data as well as
recording data from an audio CD in the Mac's internal CD ROM drive.
To further ease the editing process, M.E.S.A. is compatible with AppleScripts for the automation
of repetitive tasks.  A large selection of pre-written scripts are included with M.E.S.A. Custom
scripts can be created with any AppleScript editor. What's more, M. E.S.A. is designed to be
compatible with future Akai digital audio products.  Its modular design makes it easy to update
by simply moving a new product module to the WAVE EDITOR appropriate folder.

<h1>Alesis S4Plus</h1>
<hr>
<b>To complement the new QuadraSynth Plus Piano
         , Alesis introduces the S4
         Plus QuadraSynth Sound Module.</b> 
<p>
The S4 Plus
  has all of the power of the QuadraSynth Plus Piano
  without the master controller functions.  Instead of the
  8MB piano-oriented expansion of the QuadraSynth
  Plus Piano, the S4 Plus has a 4MB general expansion
  designed for multitimbral sequencing applications.  A
  new grand piano is included, along with a wide selection of additional sounds from
  bottle blow to brake drum, from
  tubular bell to telephone, from
  ice block to orch hit.  In addition
  to this unique expansion, the S4
  Plus also has the same 44 rhythmic loops and new
  instrument mappings of the QuadraSynth Plus Piano.
<p>


  The new sounds were designed by Alesis Sound
  Development along with leading third-party developers InVision Interactive and Northstar Productions.
  Great care was taken to choose the right expansion
  sounds to fully round out an already powerful unit.
<p>
Like the QuadraSynth Plus Piano, the S4 Plus is com-
 pletely General MIDI compatible.  Yet because of its
 specific ROM expansion, the S4 Plus may be the ulfimate General MIDI sound module.  Combine an S4
 Plus with our renown Stereo Grand Piano
 QuadraCard, and you have all of the additional sounds
 from the QuadraSynth Plus Piano with the unique
 ROM expansion of the S4 Plus.
<p>


 With 64 voices and new digital multieffects, the S4
                Plus is a serious tool for demanding
                 ultitimbral sequencing applications.
                     And with the ADAT Optical Digital
                           Output, you can literally
                               record tracks for CD
 with your S4 Plus and never leave the digital domain.
<p>


 Like the QuadraSynth Plus Piano, Alesis is providing
 an upgrade path so that the owners of the original S4
 can take advantage of all the great new "plus" features.

<h1>Microwave</h1>
<hr>
<h4>Towards the end of the 70's when Wolfgang Palm
developed wavetablesynthesis, he surely couldn't have
foreseen, even in his wildest dreams, that this then
revolutionary technology would stitl serve as a creative
tool today. Nearly twenty years later, both the
Microwave and its big brother,the Wave, are still
satisfying the demands of the current generation of
musicians. What's more, the popularity of Waldorf
sound-generating machines has achieved cult status,
the only comparable instrument being the perennial
MiniMoog.</h4>
<hr><p>
The Microwave, with its midnight blue designer
chassis, red "nose", and a display that is actually much
too small, has survived many generations of ROM
sample players. Its longevity came despite the fact
that in 1989, when it was introduced, many critics
considered its sounds very interesting but ultimately
not viable, since it featured only eight voices and no
FX unit. Why so many musicians (including the upper
echelon of internationally renowned professionals) fell
in love with the Microwave despite this dour forecast is
no great mystery; the Microwave sounds absolutely
unique and it also sounds great. We've already
mentioned wavetable technology, and that's the
reason why the Microwave sounds the way it does.
Authentic analog filters with 24dB roll-off and a more
than extensive modulation matrix also contribute.
In the 80's, the hot sounds were chiming, metallic,
alien-sounding digital sounds, while nowadays, fat,
powerful analog sounds with real-time filtering and
extreme sweeps are hip.<br>
The Microwave generates all of these types of sounds
in an unrivalled quality. Its sounds are synthesized at
the lowest sound generation stage and, basically, are
structured in the same manner as in a classic analog
synthesizer; what this means to you is that the
Microwave is a cinch to program. The sound
generating modules are tuned to deliver a level of
quality that meets the most discerning musician's
demands. You can therefore convert your ideas about
happening, quality sound into reality without having to
add a load of external effects and EQ. This quality
makes the Microwave an inspirational creative tool.
<b>Musicians tend to get addictive about their
Microwaves, and this is precisely the secret of its
phenomenal success.</b>
<hr>
Now that the Mlicrowave has been around for a while,
there is a vast range of interesting sounds available on
RAM and ROM cards as well as on disks. Moreover, we
have kept the Microwave at the cutting edge of
software technology via regular system updates. If you
buy a Microwave today, you will be the proud owner of
a device that incorporates the latest technological
standards. Wolfgang Palm's vision was to implement
his ideas with an eye on the future, and this
philosophy is still a bench-mark at Waldorf, reflected in
all our synthesizers.

<h1>
Quadrasynth Plus Piano 64 Voice 24 Megabyte Expandable Master Keyboard<br>
</h1>
<hr>
After months of designing detailed system refinements and powerful feature enhancements to the original QuadraSynth,
Alesis proudly introduces the new QuadraSynth Plus Piano.
We've added 8MB of new sound ROM to the original unit for a total of
24 megabytes onboard!  This expanded ROM set for the keyboard
includes the highly acclaimed phase-accurate stereo piano from the
Grand Piano QuadraCard.
<p>

The Preset Program area has quadrupled in size for a massive library
 of 640 internal Programs and 500 internal multitimbral Mixes!  With
 an SRAM card inserted, you can add eight additional banks which
 gives you 1,664 Programs and 1,300 Mixes immediately accessible
 from the front panel or via MIDI.  And since the library of
 QuadraSynth Programs continues to grow, you can conveniently
 expand your timbral palette with professional quality state-of-the-art
 sounds without having to purchase expensive new modules.
<p>

 Furthermore, new Alesis Sound Bridge software is included with every QuadraSynth Plus Piano.  It enables users to easily download
 up to 8MB of additional custom samples to a PCMCIA Flash or
 SRAM card for efficient integration into any QuadraSynth environ-
 ment. An enhanced user interface gives
 you more extensive front-panel control over selecting Programs and
 Mixes as well as editing.  Many secondary button functions have
 been added such as Bank Select, +10/-10 Program arrangement
 keys, and direct access to specific programming functions.
<p>

 The QuadraSynth Plus Piano is now completely General MIDI compatible, with 15 dedicated GS drumkits stored in Preset memory.
 MIDI Bank Select and Controller 10 Panning have also been added.
 Card Program data is now directly accessible as additional online
 banks.  The new Program Remain feature allows you to scroll
 through new Programs while holding down notes from previous
 Programs.  And with the QuadraSynth's vast polyphony, you can actually sustain notes from 64 different Programs simultaneously!
<p>

 Another tremendously useful enhancement is that the four Quad
 Knobs now transmit controller data either locally, to MIDI Out, or
 to both simultaneously.  This not only gives you the ability to com-
 mand a complex network of sound modules and effects processors, it
 also gives you the equivalent of four additional Mod Wheels to affect
 sounds locally!
<p>
In keeping with the Alesis tradition of studio-quality digital effects
   processing, the QuadraSynth Plus Piano has been  upgraded with
   many new effect algorithms including enhanced reverbs derived
   from our Q2 effects processor. Other new effects include overdrive,
   distortion, stereo lezlie and inverse flange.  All of the effects are 16-bit
   48kHz which gives you better-than-CD quality professional-grade
   sound.  Also, a new effects configuration gives you access to all of the
   QuadraSynth's effects algorithms on a single buss which allows you
   to choose which effects you want to employ without changing configurations or buss assignments.  For exainple, to duplicate the
   classic rock organ through a Lezlie speaker cabinet sound, you can
   assign an organ Program to go through a chorus, overdrive it, send
   it to a reverb, and then finally run the whole sound through a rotating speaker effect.  With this kind of control, you can precisely
   achieve the effect you're after, without having to comprise because
   of software limitations of the effects processor.
<p>

   Original QuadraSynth owners will be pleased to know that a corn-
   plete upgrade to QuadraSynth Plus Piano is available. Tremendous
   attention was given to the upgrade package to make certain that
   the very first QuadraSynth can be enhanced to same specifications
   as the latest QuadraSynth Plus Piano. Taking a deliberate stand
   against planned obsolescence, Alesis continues to support the original QuadraSynth with new QuadraCards with new Programs as well
   as the upgrade package to QuadrSynth Plus Piano.

<h1>SOUND EXPANSION SERIES</h1><hr><h3>Access premium Roland sounds with any MIDI synthesizer.</h3><hr>
<b>Synthesizer users have different demands. Today's systems have to be more flexible to allow individuals to expand the way they want. Roland led the way for expandable synthesizers with the popular JV-series Expandable synths. Taking it even further, Roland introduced the JV-1080 Super JV Synthesizer Module and the XP-50 Music Workstation. All this heavyweight expertise made it possible to develop the brand-new 1U rackmount Sound Expansion Series Modules for expanding synthesizer systems easily and affordably. It doesn't matter if you're using a Roland unit or not. You can still add the world renowned Roland sounds to your system.</b>

<h1><a name="M-SE1">String Ensemble M-SE1</a><br></h1>
<h2>Three-dimensional expression</h2>
The M-SE1 contains 170 string
patches, most of which are configured
from newly developed waveforms with
much more potential for creative
expression. This module lets you
control the subtle playing nuances
that distinguish strings by using your
master keyboard's controllers such
as velocity and modulation levers.
Some waveforms have undergone
Roland Sound Space (RSS) processing
to produce strings that are much
more spacious-sounding and three-
dimensional sounding. Conventional
effects just can't create strings that
sound this good.
<p>
Patches responsive to Legato Control
are also available to make sure your
attack will sound realistic and natural.
Attack components will be voiced
with note-on messages switched from
note-off messages, but with note-on
status, attack won't be applied even if
the next note is on. The M-SE1 is also
ideal for adding colorful variations to
sounds because it offers a full assort-
ment of playing techniques like area,
spiccato, pizzicato, marcato and col
legno, as well as composition varia-
tions such as solo, section (large,
small) and ensemble. There is also
a selection of synth strings.

<h2>The Complete Answer ... </h2>
<p>
Whatever your musical needs, ENSONIQ TS Series Performance/Composition
Synthesizers will take you from first inspiration to final mix - with the best sounds and features ever
found in a music workstation.
<p>

Our design philosophy for the TS Series was simple: to satisfy all of your musical needs in a single
instrument.  Whether you're a professional who needs in-depth, accessible programming parameters or
a first-time buyer looking for a wide range of practical, easy-to-use features, the TS Series' integrated
performance, sequencing, and sound programming capabilities provide a versatile music-making tool.
<p>

You can choose from two keyboards to suit your playing style: the TS-10's 61-key synth action
PolyKey keyboard with expressive polyphonic aftertouch; or the TS-12's 76-key weighted action
keyboard with the response and feel of a fine acoustic piano.
<p>

Whichever model you choose, you'll find a vast sound spectrum at your fingertips - rich, lifelike
acoustic and orchestral instruments, warm, exotic synth textures, funky dance/rap groove sounds, and
drum kits for any style of music - along with the ability to load and play ENSONIQ's entire library of
sampled sounds.
<p>

The many recording and editing functions of the 24-track on-board sequencer give you all the tools
you need to capture and produce your musical ideas.  Plus the TS Series is fully General MIDI
compatible for accurate playback of GM data received from computers and other General MIDI
devices.
<p>

Best of all, the TS-10 and TS-12 are easier to use than any other comparable keyboard.  We've taken
out tedious set-up requirements and guesswork by assigning separate buttons to single functions.  And
ENSONIQ's software design is so logical and intuitive that it seems to know just what you want to do
next.
<p>

Whether you're performing on stage, composing at home, or producing at a professional studio, the
TS-10 and TS-12 provide a truly comprehensive musicmaking environment - <b>the complete answer to
all of your musical needs.</b>
<p>

<h2>Two Keyboard Options</h2>
<p>

The TS-12's 76-key weighted action keyboard - the same keyboard found in our popular KS-32 - has
the same touch and dynamic response as your favorite acoustic piano.  For a faster, lighter touch and
added nuance with each note, the TS-10's 61-key synth-action keyboar features ENSONIQ's exclusive
polyphonic aftertouch.  Both TS instruments contain a variety of velocity curves, designed in conjunc
tion with leading keyboard artists, to match a broad range of playing styles.
<p>

<h2>Sound Possibilities</h2>
<p>

<h4>Range of Sounds</h4> - The TS Series continues our commitment to provide musicians with many diverse,
nocompromise sounds.  Based on 254 waveforms, we've created over 700 incredible Programs and
Performance Presets, providing a sound for every style of music.  Load and play ENSONIQ sampled
sound disks for even more acoustic and electronic sounds, drum loops, and sound effects - the
possibilities are endless.
<p>

<h4>Sampled Sounds</h4> - We've given you room for up to 20 of our ASR/EPS sampled sounds (with 2 MB of
industry standard SIMM memory upgradeable to 8 MB).  Because the TS Series also includes the
voice architecture of an ENSONIQ sampler, not only can you play sampled sounds, you can also edit
them, and even save your edits.  The optional SP-4 SCSI Interface gives you access to CD-ROMs
from ENSONIQ an third-party companies, each containing hundreds of Megabytes of Sampled
Sounds.  And ENSONIQ sampler owner can connect their current hard drives and load files directly
into the TS.
<p>

Our exclusive <b>Auto-Load feature</b> gives you two ways to automatically load samples from floppy disk
or SCSI: on power up it reloads the samples you used last; or when you load a song file, it retrieves the
needed sampled sounds.
<p>

<h2>Innovative Technologies</h2>
<p>

With each new instrument, ENSONIQ brings musicians innovative and useful technologies.  Our
latest ENSONIQ exclusive, SoundFinder TM, searches for sounds by musical categories to locate any
type of sound quickly and easily.  Patch Select buttons, another ENSONIQ exclusive, can instantly
call-up different sound options.  Use them to either emulate acoustic instrument performance
characteristics or to access other musical variations.  The Hyper-Wave TM wave-sequencing voice
architecture lets you add expressive melodic, textural, and rhythmic elements to your music from 16-
step wave lists.  And TransWaueSTM provide sweeping, dynamic timbral change from a single
waveform.
<p>

<h2>State-of-the-Art Effects</h2>
<p>

No other keyboard offers more effects processing capabilities than the TS Series.  The custom 24-bit
internal effects processor is the same one used in our acclaimed <i>DP/4 Parallel Effects Processor</i>.  You
have 73 algorithms and 692 pre-programmed effects setups that range from subtle to dramatic.  Shape
your sound just the way you want with extensive real-time control over every effects parameter.
<p>

<h2>Pitch Tables</h2>
<p>

Emulate period tunings, ethnic instruments, and more with fully programmable Pitch Tables.  The 33
built-in pitch tables cover a wide range of tuning styles, and our special performance mode lets you
change tunings on-the-fly during live performance.
<p>

<h2>Powerful Sequencing</h2>
<p>

The TS Series' powerful 24-track on-board sequencer is exceptionally easy to use.  Record up to 60
sequences or songs in any combination with standard 30,000 note capacity (expandable to over
97,000 notes).  There's real time, stepentry and multi-track recording, with range editing,
swing/percentage/random quantization options, and much more.  Audition all edits before saving
changes, and record all volume/panning changes for each track with the AutoMix mixdown feature. 
Create ritards and other expressive tempo changes with ENSONIQ's Tempo Track.
<p>

<h2>Versatile Performance Control</h2>
<p>
You can map out sounds before you play with complete control over
both internal and external MIDI sound sources.  A TS keyboard is a sophisticated MIDI master
controller with up t 12 discrete keyboard zones.  Splits, layers, and special combinations are easy to
create and save.  Performance Presets let you name and save 120 custom sound combinations, with
another 180 Presets permanently store in ROM.  Global editing parameters let you adjust sounds or
sound combinatio fast and easily with convenient control over relative volumes, panning, brightness,
attack and release times, velocity, MIDI controllers, and much more.
<p>

<h2>General MIDI Compatibility</h2>
<p>

The TS Series is fully General MIDI compatible, providing a special 16-channel multi-timbral
reception mode. It can accurately play back music created according to the universal GM program
mapping, with all 128 GM sounds (plus all 9 GM and GS drum kits) permanently stored in ROM. In GM mode, the TS keyboard becomes a
high-quality sound source for playing back GM data received from a personal computer or hardware
sequencer. Use the TS to listen to computer game sound tracks, GM-based song libraries, and many
interesting educational and recreational computer software packages.
You can disable reception on selected channels to play your own accompaniment, lead line, or
percussion to a fully orchestrated song.  And the TS Series' advanced synthesizer engine guarantees
playback accuracy and fidelity for spectacular-sounding music.
<p>

<h2>Plus More</h2>
<p>

Along with 2 stereo Main outputs, the TS has 2 dry AUX outputs so you can connect to other signal
processing gear (like a DP14) for more sound shaping and mixing control.  A highdensity disk drive,
convenient MIDI system exclusive recorder for storing data from other gear, 2 dual pedal inputs, and a
CV pedal input give greater performance flexibility.<br>
Expand your creative possibilities with ENSONIQ sound programs and sampled sound disks,
including the 540 pre-programmed drum patterns in the TSD-1002 Rhythm Construction Kit - it's like
having a session drummer on call!
Only ENSONIQ - the company that pioneered the synthesizer-based workstation - could integrate so
many composition and performance features into a sophisticated, yet easy-to-use instrument. Designed
by musicians for musicians, the TS-10 and TS-12 will satisfy all of your musical needs!

<h1>Trinity Series Music Workstation DRS</h1><hr>
<h2>SOUNDS</h2><b>The TRINITY-Series represents a new breakthrough in PCM sound generation. By painstakingly sampling only the best sounds and processing
them through flexible filters and effects, ACCESS
ushers in a new era in PCM sound quallty.</b><p>

ACCESS fully digitizes sound production from
source to filter to effects. This system takes the
conventional concept of simply sampling good
instrumental sounds under good conditions a giant
step further. It reproduces the best sounds created
by the best artists playing the best instruments
under ideal conditions.<p>
Trinity's large 24MB PCM ROM makes it possible to store 375 multi-samples and 258 drum samples. And it plays back at a state-of-the-art 48kHz
sampling frequency.<p>
A multi-mode filter featuring High-Pass, Low-Pass, Band-Pass and Band-Reject modes plus
Resonance makes highly flexible filtering possible.
Trinity features 100 insert effects and 14 master effects which are used for overall ambiance.
These include reverbs, delays, distortion and
rotary speaker plus new algorithms like a two-
voice resonator, pitch shifting, stereo random
flanging, decimator and many more.<p>
In the sequence and combination modes,
each timhre can have its own insert effects for a
total of up to eight simultaneous effects. For exam-
ple, you can have reverb on a snare, distorted gui-
tar and a chorused electric piano all at the same
time. All these sounds can then go through the
two modulation/delay and reverb/delay master
effects for further processing.<p>

<b>Korg's DSP-based Multi Oscillator Synthesis
System (MOSS) is capable of reproducing and
combining five different synthesis methods like
Analog Synthesis, Physical Modeling and Variable
Phase Modulation (VPM).</b><p>

MOSS', Trinity's other sound source, also
powers Korg's exciting new Prophecy Solo
Synthesizer. It uses DSP to create monophonic
sounds that range from heart-stopping vintage
synth leads and basses through amazingly accurate physical models of brass, reed and plucked
acoustic instruments right on through to sounds
you've never heard before.<p>

<b>Diverse sound programs that consistently deliver.</b><p>

TRINITY is programmed with all the sounds
you require for both live performance and music
production. TRINITY's ACCESS sound source
delivers 256 programs and 256 combinations
while its DSP-based MOSS' sound source delivers an additional 64 programs.<p>
Split, Multi and Layer Combinations are all possible using programs produced by
both sound sources. For example, you can perform solo MOSS" sounds with your
right hand while playing ACCESS sounds with your left! Your sounds can also be
 saved on floppy disk or, with SCSI, onto a hard drive.
<p>
<b>Sample Playback/Flash ROM makes it possible to use an even broader range of sounds.</b><p>

Trinity's PCM memory is substantially expanded with the addition of its
optional 8MB Flash ROM board. When using the optional sample-playback system
disk, data sampled in either the KORG Sample Data Library or the AKAI Sampler
format is read into the flash ROM and 256 program and combination memory
locations are added.<p>
The Flash ROM option provides another bonus. With Flash ROM, Trinity's MOSS'-
based Solo Synth option provides 128 programs -- double the original 64!<p>

<h2>FUNCTlON & USER INTERFACE</h2>

<b>With the TRINITY-Series, a musician can perform, compose, arrange and record
with just one instrument. And its easy to-use TouchView Graphical User
Interface and controllers make the TRINITY an efficient tool that enhances, not
hinders, the creative process.</b><p>

<h3>How TouchView Graphical User Interface responds to your touch.</h3><p>
The TRINITY-Series features a TouchView
Graphical User Interface system. TouchView boasts
a large, high resolution 320 x 240 dot touch-screen
display that presents a clear view of the instru-
ment's functions and parameters. Rather than
pressing an endless series of cursor keys to select a
parameter, you simply touch it on the screen.<p>

<h3>On-board 16-track MIDI sequencer.</h3>

Trinity's sequencer is 16-part multi-timbral and features 16-tracks, 1/192 note res-
olution and a memory capacity of 80,000 notes. It is also compatible with Standard
MIDI files. With the TouchView Graphical User Interface, track volume slider and
parameter values can be visually confirmed and operated by just touching the screen.<p>

<h3>Flexible controllers, maximum expression.</h3>

TRINITY features an Alternate Modulation System and Effect Dynamic
Modulation that allow you to assign control sources such as the ribbon controller,
joystick, switches and foot controllers flexibly. And other control sources like the
sound's envelope or note number can also be assigned to yield hands-free, real-
time expression.<p>
It's worth noting that, in addition to the instrument's many other control sources,
TRINITY's pressure-sensitive, dynamic ribbon controller really allows the player to
imprint his personality onto its sounds. Moving one's finger across its surface and
varying pressure with the fingertip provide an intuitive, "gut-level" interface.
<hr>

<h3>DRS (Digital Recording System)</h3>

<b>The TRINITY-Series employs a Digital
Recording System that completely revises the conventional concept of a music workstation. A harddisk recorder and various digital interfaces make
it possible to network a digital reeonting system
configured with ADAT, DATrecorder and harddisk</b><p>

<h4>HaRd Disk Recorder function</h4>

The TRINITY-Series can utilize a 4-track digital
hard disk recorder, making it possible to record
external signals via the input terminal in 16-bit resolution and at a 48kHz sampling frequency.
Punch in/out, copy/insert, delete, erase and other
editing features are all provided. It is capahle of 50
minutes of recording time (using a 543MB hard
disk and recording in stereo at 48kHz).<p>
The built-in MIDI sequencer is also capable of
synchronous control. This means, for example,
that a prerecorded piece can be synchronized
when recording vocals or guitar parts on the hard
disk recorder -- an ability that is not possible with
conventional music workstations.<p>
The TRINITY proX comes standard with a hard
disk recorder and a 543MB on-board hard drive.
<hr>
<b>Korg's new Trinity series of music
workstations features a huge collection of high-quality sounds, new featuras, a new
tone generator, new parameters, a unigue
TouchView- graphical user interface and a
wide variaty of expansion options.</b>
<hr>
With all the new features of this instrument, Korg has
created a fresh palette of sounds to go with them.
The Trinity's PCM ROM features an entirely nev set
of 375 multisounds and 258 drum sounds, sampled at 48kHz.
Great care was taken at the sampling sessions to ensure the
highest quality sound. Everything from top-quality microphones to top musicians were used to get the best source
material from which to create the samples.<p>
The Combination mode features eight timbres, each with
its own key windows and velocity windows for creating
multitimbral layers, splits and complex performance setups.
Add to this another eight timbres and you have the basis for
the Trinity's powerful 16-track 80,000-note sequencer.<p>
The Combination and Sequencer modes feature graphic
faders and panpots that you can adjust simply by touching the
screen! Both modes also take advantage of the Trinity's breakthrough effects system. You can use up to eight simultaneous
insert effects as well as two master effects. This means that you
can put a distortion effect on the guitar track, a rotary speaker
effect on the organ track, heavy flanging on the drum track,
EQ on the bass track...you get the idea. After all that you can
still run everything through varying amounts of chorus and hall
reverb (or flanging and delay, or delay and room reverb, or...)<p>

<b>Room to Grow</b><p>
0ne of the great things about the Trinity that sets it
apart from the rest of the workstations out there is its
wide variety of options. Some of these, like the Solo
Synth option, come standard on all but the base model Trinity.
Others, such as the Flash ROM option are optional for all
models.<p>
The Solo Synth option gives you the heart of Korg's nev,
Prophecy solo synthesizer built right into the Trinity. This
gives you a whole new world of synthesis techniques such as
Physical Modeling for creating emulative and original tone
colors. You can even create combinations and sequences
using these sounds together with the Trinity's A.C.C.E.S.S. tone
generator sounds.<p>
The Flash ROM option lets you add up to eight
megabytes of new sampled sounds. These sounds can come
from Korg sounci libraries or from any Akai format sound
library. When you add the Flash ROM option, you also get
two more banks of programs and combinations -- that's 512
programs and 512 combinations in all! What's more, if you
installed the Solo Synth option, you'll get an additional 64 Solo
Synth memory locations, for a total of 128.<p>
The SCSI option lets you connect a hard disk for saving
your programs, combinations and sequences, or for loading
samples to the Flash ROM. (It is also part of the Hard Disk
Recorder option -- read on.)
The Digital Output option adds an Alesis ADAT
compatihle output for digital transfer of Trinity signals for up
to four channels.
<p>
And last, but certainly not least: the Hard Disk Recorder
option. With this option, it is actually possible to incorporate
up to four tracks of real-world sounds such as vocals, saxophone, guitar -- or anything you want -- into your sequences.
This option makes the Trinity the world's first true music
workstation, allowing the entire music procluction process --
from composing and recording to editing and mixing -- to he
realizedl completely on the Trinity without the need for additional equipment. What's more, you can mix your final product directly to D)AT, keeping everything in the digital domain.<p>

<b>Putting It All Together
</b><p>
Now, lets create a theoretical song. Start by laying
down a basic drum track.Next we'll add bass and
synth pad parts. We can have some of the melody
playedby a physically-modeled trumpet from the Solo Synth
option. Later in the song we'll insert a program change message to clxinge the Solo Synth trumpet to a fat analog synth
bass. Add to this orchestral hits, ethnic percussion and digeridoo samples from the Flash ROM. Then, using the Hard Disk
Recorder, recordl some vocals and a distorted electric guitar
playing rhythmic accents. Finally, from DAT, fly in some
stereo background ambiance recorded at a nearby cafe.<p>
Each sequence track and audio track has its own volume,
panning; and effect sends (the audio tracks can he processed
by the master effects). Each audio track also has its own high
and low EQ. Insert control changes into the sequencer to
change sequence track volume and panning. You can even
automate the Hard Disk Recorder tracks' mix. Now that we've
got everything sounding just right, we can mix down to DAT.<p>

<b>The addition of the Hard Disk Recorder opens new possibilities for music production. You can start by flying-
in a basic rhythm track of drums, bass and guitar from
a DAT and work around that, adding keyboard parts, percussion, special effects and other audio sweetening. You can also
use the Hard Disk Recorder to create huge multitrack
sequences that go beyond the Trinity's 16-track 32-note polyphonic limit, by recording 16 tracks at a time from the S/PDIF
output to the S/PDIF input (this requires an RCA cable). Of
course you'll want to make sure that you are satisfied with the
choice of programs, effects and the mix before doing so,
because it's the sound of the sequence and not the sequence
data itself that gets recorded.<p>
All the henefits of random access are available, such as
the ability to instantly jump to any location of a song without
having to wait. We haven't even touched on the editing capabilities of the Hard Disk Recorder which include the ability to
copy and move auclio in a track, as well as keep multiple
takes of a vocal, for example, ancl edit them together to
create a new take of only the best sections.
After a project is finished, you can back up your hard disk
information to a DAT tape, for archiving and later retrieval.</b>

<h1>
Het KnoopPunt Kettingverhaal
<br clear=right>
<br clear=left>
</h1>
Hier onder vindt U het eerste kettingverhaal, samengesteld uit tientallen
anonieme bijdragen via onze interactieve pagina.
Het werd geschreven in de periode van 26 december tot 20 februari 1996.
<p>
Ondertussen zijn we bezig aan het tweede verhaal. 
Je vindt het op <a href="http://www.knooppunt.be/cgi-bin/kettingverhaal.pl">http://www.knooppunt.be/cgi-bin/kettingverhaal.pl</a>.
<h2>Verhaal 1</h2>
Er was eens een prinses, Kwakkeltrap genaamd.

<p>
Ze woonde in een groot paleis op een enorm 

<p>
vuilnisbelt, waar

<p>


<p>
Eindelijk is het terug! Nodig verdomd eens een eenzame uit en steek het haardvuur aan in plaats van

<p>


<p>
naar die stomme TV te kijken! Of nodig jezelf eens uit bij een eenzame al wil die het eigenlijk zelf niet. Maar in deze eindejaarstijden willen we toch zo sociaal  mogelijk doen, zonder dat iemand merkt dat we in werkelijkheid alleen maar aan het lellebel






<p>
len zijn, want wat doe je anders met de kerst, zeker als er eindelijk definitieve wereldvrede is. Nee, geef

<p>
mij maar een andere verslaving. Zit al teveel achter compus.

<p>
Vroeger kon ik urenlang in de oven kijken naar een kip die stillaan krimpt onder de gloeiende hitte van de gasbranders.  Maar nu, op deze eerste dag van het nieuwe jaar, lijkt het me plots niet eens

<p>
... de moeite.
Elk nieuw jaar maken we beloftes die we
in februari al vergeten zijn.

<p>
In maart recycleren we ze tot mooie salontafeltjes.

<p>


<p>
Hoofdstuk 2:


<p>
De ketting begon zwaar te wegen

<p>
en daarom besloten we oliebollen te gaan eten.

<p>


<p>
Maar we hadden pech, cremerie verbist maak geen oliebollen in de zomer. 

<p>
Dus hielden we zes maanden een zomerslaap.

<p>
Maar toen kwam hij terug. Hij was niet gemist geworden, merkte hij tot zijn spijt.
Niemand nam ooit enige notie van hem.


<p>
Behalve de hond, maar dat was nogal wiedes, vanwege de oliebollengeur die altijd in z'n kleren hing.

<p>
Altijd was wel iet of wat overdreven. Zo vaak bakte hij nu ook weer geen oliebollen. Erger vond hij dat zijn goeie vriend niet was komen proeven.
Hadden de aktiviteiten bij diens laatste bezoek hem dan zo aangegrepen?
Zo vermoeiend?

<p>
Of waren de oliebollen niet spacecakerig genoeg ?

<p>
Om daarover enige zekerheid te verkrijgen kunnen we natuurlijk bij een specialist te rade gaan.

<p>
Zonder weliswaar onze conditie te verwaarlozen.

<p>
Je krijgt er tenslotte gauw een paar kilootjes bij.

<p>
Ja, zou 'k zo denken, voor sumo-worstelen komen we toch nooit in aanmerking.
Magere kippen, die we zijn. 

<p>
Maar misschien verandert dat als we maar voldoende Sumoworsten eten?

<p>


<p>
In de box is op dit ogenblik geen zin anwezig. Wat wordt bedoeld met de laatste zin ?

<p>
Dat is de zin die als je het uiteindelijke verhaal leest diegene is die je zo juist gelezen hebt.

<p>
Net zoals de zin van je leven wellicht de zin van HET leven bevat, en die je daarom niet kan bedenken.

<p>
Waardoor je steeds maar duidelijker gaat beseffen hoe moeilijk het is zinvolle zinnen te maken. 
Die nog begrijpelijk zijn bovendien!


<p>
Zin in pannekoeken, om maar iets te noemen.

<p>
Oliebollen! Oliebollen! Oliebollen!

<p>
Hoofdstuk 3.

<p>
Paragraaf 1

<p>
Naast de succesvolle invoering van de term paramedici, werd voor de gevallen adel een gelijkaardige terminologie uitgewerkt, bijvoorbeeld: paragraaf.

<p>
"Nu moet je niet denken, dat ik bovenstaande zin ga paraferen!", riep de jonge baron verontwaardigd uit. "Sinds mijn vader overleden is en ik het bestuur van de onderneming heb overgenomen, lijkt het wel alsof ik een parafeermachine geworden ben! Ik heb n




auwelijks de tijd om alles in te kijken, laat staan te lezen. En de parafine is ook bijna op!"
"Ja, baron," reageerde de bedrijfsleider, "hoe paradoxaal het ook moge klinken, hoe meer werk, hoe meer paradigma's, zoals uw wijze vader altijd zei."
De altijd aanwezige letterkundige, sinds jaar en dag verbonden aan het bedrijf, reageerde - zoals steeds - gevat:"Mij zal het vooral benieuwen hoe lang ik hier nog aan het woord zal kunnen blijven. Het lijkt wel het de Paradox van Ndizi: hoe meer letters,




 hoe meer vensters!"
Jeanine, de behoedzame, vond het hoog tijd om de gemoederen te kalmeren: "Komaan, als we op deze manier bezig blijven, breekt de ketting nog eens. We hebben dan wel een verhaal, maar wat heeft de andere dan nog te zeggen?"
Scrivens, de letterkundige weer: "Ja, en toch ben ik benieuwd hoe lang ik zo aan de gang kan gaan. Het is misschien niet helemaal net en de etiquetten zijn bijna op, maar toch, moest er zo dadelijk geen heerlijke BRT-avond beginnen en moest ik zo moe niet




 zijn, ik bleef nog een tijdje aan de gang."
De baron had - oh jeugdige overmoed - het laatste woord: "Hoera, ik heb het, ik heb het!"

<p>
De juiste syntax, daar gaat het om!

<p>
Inderdaad, en ook de definitieve beslissing over de nieuwe spelling. Daar kon hij soms wel van wakker liggen.


<p>
Valeriaanthee zorgde in die omstandigheden voor enig soelaas.

<p>
In Rwanda schijnt men de beste kwaliteit valeriaan te telen. Maar of je dat in Gent vindt?
En dan in al dat verkeer gaan zoeken, zeker? Dan nog liever in een werkgroep stappen en voorzitter worden.


<p>
Hallo, spreek ik met de voorzitter van de Werkgroep STAPPEN? Mmmm... het bekt niet echt goed, maar het gaat tenslotte om het voorzitter zijn, dus mij zal je over het bekken niet horen mopperen.

<p>
Ja, inderdaad, dat zou ik nu eens graag doen, zie! Samen eens gaan stappen!
In de stad of in de wilde natuur, maakt mij niet uit! Als we maar stappen!


<p>
Maar eerst wil ik toch liefst van al een zak oliebollen consumeren.

<p>
En dan, dan pas wil ik nadenken...

<p>
Nadenken? Nadenken doe je met je hersens. Hersens wegen maximaal 1,3kg. En toch zit daar alles in.
En hersens produceren taal, taal om mee te praten. Taal is het enige wat je hebt om met de andere te praten?
Tuurlijk niet! Er is zoveel meer! Zoveel anders! Taal is zo onbelangrijk, want taal is pas goed als ze woordeloos is.
Waarden zijn woordeloos, woorden zijn waardeloos.


<p>
Oliebollen daarentegen, vertegenwoordigen een vaste waarde; niet alleen in ekonomische zin, maar ook als metafoor, als diepste aller diepzinnige zinnebeelden voor wat wij met olie op onze planeet aanrichten. Neem een willekeurig rekenmachientje, tik het m




agische getal 7.083.170 in, draai het rekenmachientje vervolgens om, en wat zie je? Precies! Het woord Oliebol! 

<p>
Een oliebol is het zuiverste culinaere genot: geen additieven zoals mayo of worstjes zoals bij de friet.

<p>
De sociaal-politieke konsekwenties ervan zijn niet gering!

<p>
De vraag is of we er dan ook niet beter mee kunnen stoppen.

<p>
Ja da's nog een idee. Dat ik daar niet zelf aan dacht.
En dan een kettingverhaal rond een bepaald idee, thema, gegeven???

<p>
Ja! Iets geheel nieuws: oliekubussen bijvoorbeeld, dat is immers voer voor de toekomst!

<p>
of plutonium hoetsbollen, goed voor de tracheen (shit, waar is mijn groene boekje nu weer)

<p>
Het is in beslag genomen, vanwege het encryptieverbod. Alleen openboekjes zijn nog toegestaan, gedrukt op doorzichtig materiaal.

<p>
Er is nieuws over encriptie.

<p>
Het is goed nieuws: het is toch toegestaan, op voorwaarde dat je bovenaan de teks de encryptiesleutel in vetjes vermeld, voorzien van een duidelijk voorbeeld van de toepassing ervan, gevolgd door een korte samenvatting van de inhoud van de gecodeerde teks




t!

<p>
Een mysterie schuilt soms ook wel in een klein hoekje.
Zei de computerleraar tegen zijn beginnende leerlingen: zet de muis in de linkerbovenhoek.
Een van hen nam de muis op en plaatste ze in de linkerbovenhoek van het scherm.
De sleutel: Matteus 4,5,18


<p>
En dxn nog best vxn xl xchterstevoren xxneengeplxt!. 

<p>
Achterstevoren gepakt? Wat is dit een SM-story ofzo?

<p>
Oh ja, natuurlijk... het betekent zeker Scrambled Message, sorry hoor, ik was het even vergeten.

<p>
Waarover gaat dat hier eigenlijk?

<p>
Hierin wordt geschreven over de diepere zin van het leven, maar soms ook over de meest triviale dingen.

<p>
Ongeveer zoals op de WC de diepere inhoud van de mens tot uiting komt. Dat kan alleen maar gezond zijn!

<p>
Mogen we ooit eens het volledige verhaal lezen?


<p>
Mogen we er munt uitslaan?

<p>
Zolang het maar voor een goed doel is.

<p>
Bekenden van mij, die soms wel eens naar een voetbalmatch gaan, waren onlangs laaiend enthousiast over
het doel van Anderlecht. Maar zelf weet ik het nog zo niet.


<p>
Ik dacht bij mezelf, het doel van Anderlecht is poen scheppen, niets meer.

<p>
Maar wat is dan de bestaansreden van Raymond Ceulemans?

<p>
De vraag stellen is ze beantwoorden, zekerst!

<p>
Stel het antwoord maar, nu of toch!

<p>
Het antwoord was gegeven voor de vraag al was gesteld.

<p>
Wat beter is dan opgegeven en uitgesteld.

<p>
En zeker beter dat uitgegeven en opgesteld!

<p>
Om nog maar te zwijgen van uitgeteld en opgegeven!

<p>
Daar hebben wij geen enkele notie van.  Geef ons maar 3 kilo geplette druiven in eigen nat.  

<p>
Ik hoop dat U er zich niet aan stoort dat ik -- de
artisanale wijnkunst respecterend -- de druiven 
eigen*voetig* heb geplet.  

<p>
Bij wijze van hyginische maatregel heb ik daarbij twee paar verse sokken aangedaan!

<p>
Vergeet je vingernagels niet te reinigen.

<p>
Ook het goed wassen van de kleding is belangrijk.

<p>
Het komt tot een echte confrontatie tussen de koning en de eerste minister.

<p>
Over prioriteiten betreffende het gebruik van het enige urinoir in het paleis werd immers nooit een kamerdebat gevoerd!

<p>
De minister heeft bovendien nog geen algemene verkiezingen uitgeschreven en hij zet de konding onder druk over zijn geheime besprekingen met de oppositie en een aantal minder betrouwbare ledenvan de regering.


<p>
Het zou naar verluidt iets met oliebollen te maken hebben, maar daarover wilde geen van de betrokken partijen enig commentaar over kwijt.


<p>
Of beter: het zou naar verluid iets met oliebollen te maken hebben, maar daar wilde geen van de betrokken partijen enig commentaar over kwijt.


<p>
De stilte werkt soms als een saus die de woorden overgiet.

<p>
Maar dan, als je er een schepje van neemt... WAW! TABASCO!

<p>
Dus toch, liefde op het eerste gezicht!


<p>
(Een zacht strijkkwartetje weerklinkt op de achtergrond)...

<p>
Het denken aan hem streelde haar zacht.

<p>
Ze voelde zich veiliger, droger en schoner dan ooit... ze had nooit durven vermoeden dat de produktontwikkelaar van Always Ultra zoveel voor haar zou gaan betekenen.

<p>
In de holle straten klonk een verlaten stem : "Weg met de eenzaamheid!"

<p>
Na vele dagen van dat soort eenzaamheid slaagde hij er eindelijk weer in aansluiting te vinden. Maar aansluiting bij wat? bij wie?
En in de bolle boswegen klonk een gelaten stem: "Niet nog eens!"


<p>
TCP! PPP! Format C:!... ah.. dat lucht op.

<p>
PLUIMVEE! LET OP UW VEREN!


<p>
Een blinde vos herkent zijn prooi aan losvliegend  pluimage.


<p>
Of aan de geur van oliebollen.

<p>
Ja, de geur van oliebollen is niet te vergelijken met de onmetelijke zinloosheid van de geur van spruitjes, toch?

<p>
Hoewel deze laatste voor de Belgische politiek niet onbelangrijk is.

<h1>SOUND PROCESSOR - WAVE EDITOR - AUDIO DATABASE</h1><hr>
<h3>WaveLab - the new generation sound editor.<br>
Professional Audio Processing, TimeStretching, Pitchshifting, Dynamic Processing and
Frequency Analysis, brought to you on your Windows PC.</h3>
The PC has now reached a technological level which makes it ideal for creative
audio applications. With the Windows 95 operating system you have the power --
through multitasking and 32-bit processing -- to carry out even the most intensive
editing and processing.<br>
The time was right for a sound editor fulfilling every user's dreams. Now,
Steinberg's WaveLab for Windows is here - and it does even more:
<hr>
<h3>WaveLab is fast<br>
WaveLab supports 32-bit processing<br>
WaveLab supports true multitasking<br>
WaveLab is totally musical</h3>
<hr>
<h3>Don't stop the Music.</h3>
Even the most complex processing can be carried out while the music is still playing --
in keeping with Steinberg's motto.
<hr>
<h3>Batch Processing</h3>

WaveLab's batch processing saves time and energy, and consequently increases your
creativity. A whole list of sound files can be processed -- without you actually doing the
work. Let's imagine you have a number of files with too low a level -- 3db, too wide a
dynamic range, and which have to be changed from Stereo-WAV format into Mono-AIFF
format.<p>
Sounds like a nightmare? That was before WaveLab.
WaveLab's batch processing does the work for you. Choose the appropriate functions:
normalize, compression, file conversion etc... Tell WaveLab where the selected files are,
and where they are to be saved, then start the batch processing.
In the meantime you can concentrate on more important things, then admire the whole
collection of processed files at your leisure!
<hr>
<h3>AudioAccess</h3>

WaveLab includes AudioAccess, the first
'integrated' database on the PC which
manages audio files on multiple media. It
stores and organises references to all the audio
files residing on your hard disk(s), CD-ROM
and other removable medias. Disks can be
scanned to find specific files. Audio files can
be organized as a custom hierarchy of groups
eg. Sound Effects/Nature/Animal/Birds), and
they can be searched by size, date and
attributes (mono/stereo/resolution/rate/format),
comment, keywords, group or disk location.
Different search presets can be saved, and
your files can also be sorted according to these
criteria. Audio files can be visually displayed
in a list or as icons (as in the Windows 95
Explorer). Proprietary implementation of 32-bit
technology gives extremely fast database
access, and multiple databases can be open at
the same time. Drag and drop files from one
database to another.
<hr>
<h3>Projects:</h3>

WaveLab helps to give you an instant overview of
an entire project. Imagine you are working on a
bunch of files, for a special project, which reside on
various disks and belong to different logical groups.
Sounds like a heavy collecting session?
Just save your setup as a project, and next time all
your files will automatically appear in the correct
position on screen.
<hr>
<h3>Musicality - User Interface and Functions</h3>

The intuitive user interface supports every aspect of your sound processing. Each function
is presented in a clear and easy-to-understand way. Edit the compression curve, or use the
supplied presets. Your enthusiasm for experimentation won't be limited by speed and
processing power. WaveLab does all its calculations in the background, while the music is
playing, so you can hear the results right away. Unlimited UNDO and REDO let you
compare different versions, and if necessary, undo or restore actions.
<hr>
<h3>Cut, Copy and Paste</h3>

Cutting and pasting large audio files has never been so
easy. Select a segment and drag it into another file.
Hear the result right away.
WaveLab always 'snaps' to exactly the right position,
giving you completely seamless edits.
Any number of markers can be placed in a sound file,
giving you a complete overview, and making sure that
"on the fly" crossfades are a reality.
<hr>
<h3>Time Compression/Pitch Shifting:</h3>

WaveLab offers Timestretching and Pitchshifting to cater for the most complex requirements. Vocals, speech, drumloops, or a complete mix -- WaveLab handles your material carefully to give just the right result. WaveLab
transposes, shortens or lengthens audio recordings -- at lightening speed.<br>
Let's imagine you have a bunch of files containing speech, which are too long in total. Set up the parameters and leave the work to WaveLab's Batch Processor. Similarly, a small piece of bad intonation in a vocal passage can easily be selected and the pitch corrected using the unlimited UNDO facility!
<hr>
<h3>Spectral Analysis</h3>

From now on, there's no more mystery. The search
for the ultimate mix with just the right amount of
punch and clarity is now a reality. Analyse your
favourite production in WaveLab and discover
where those mysterious frequencies are that make
it sound so 'punchy'.<p>
Run the EQ with the 'right' frequency adjustments
and enjoy your really happening mix!
<hr>
<h3>File Compatibility</h3>

WaveLab supports WAV- and AIFF-Files in Mono,
Stereo and with all Sample Rates. Drag & Drop
between mono and stereo files plus the ability to
handle two mono files as a single stereo file makes
WaveLab the ideal sound tool for all Session 8 users.
<hr>
<h3>Waiting for results was yesterday<br>
WaveLab is tomorrow<br>
...Available for you today!</h3>
<hr>
<h2>For the very first time, WaveLab lets you
experience the true processing power
available from Windows 95 and NT.</h2>

other controller data.
<h4>Score Edit</h4> displays MIDI data as real notes.
A wealth of settings lets you decide how you want the MIDI data shown.  This is a real editor
with comprehensive tools, not a 'convert-to-note-picture' function.  You edit using the tool box.
All changes are immediately reflected in the MIDI output.  Cubasis prints too: Print it out in
high quality standard notation, for the world to see and maybe to play!
<hr>
<h2>The Cubase Line</h2>
The family of Cubase MIDI recording programs is available for Windows, Macintosh, Power
Macintosh and Atari.  Your songs can be easily exchanged between them.  You can grow with
Cubase, thanks to Steinberg's comprehensive upgrade policy.  Upgrade from one program to
any other - or even switch to another computer!

<h1>RECYCLE: The Ultimate Tool For Sampled Grooves</h1>
<hr><p>
<h4>Every now and then a truly innovative product hits the market. You know, the kind that makes you shake your head in wonder, maybe smile a little and say: "Now why on earth didn't somebody think of that before? Why didn't I?". Steinberg ReCycle! has just this effect on people. So what is it, anyway?
<p>

Well, that's a tricky one. You see, things that are truly new are often hard to describe. No label sticks to them, no neat little marketing slots fits them. Perhaps you might call it "the first specialized software tool for people using sampled loops and grooves". Or maybe a "breakbeat analyzer and editor". Or maybe something else. Whatever you want to call it, ReCycle! is set to revolutionize the way we work with sampled loops and grooves in much the same way that sampled loops and grooves have revolutionized music itself.
<p>

Pretty BIG words, eh? They get even bigger...</h4>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
We gave up trying to find that magic all-inclusive five
  word description of ReCycle!.
  Instead, let us tell you what it does:
  In simple terms, ReCycle! lets you do with sampled loops
  what you can do with beats programmed from individual
  drum sounds - like alter the tempo, replace the sounds
  and process them individually.
  Sounds impossible?  Wait until you've read the full menu:
<p>
<b>With ReCycle! you can:</b>
  <ul>
<li>Automate the tedious process of making a sampled groove fit the tempo of your song.
<li>  Change the tempo of a groove without altering its pitch.
<li>  Change the pitch of a groove - or the individual hits that make up the groove - without altering its tempo.
<li>  Remove and/or replace any sound inside the sampled groove without altering its feel.
<li>  Send different sounds in the groove to different sampler outputs for individual processing.
<li>  Alter the volume of the individual sounds of the groove.
<li>  Change the timing of the groove - yes, you can even quantize it!
<li>  Use the feel of the groove to quantize other MIDI recordings.
<li>  Alter the ambience of a groove.
<li>  Make pitched grooves (like guitar riffs) fit songs in other keys than the recorded one.
<li>  Automatically isolate and extract individual sounds out of long samples.
<li>  Automatically normalize the levels of the sounds in the groove for optimum sound quality.
<li>  And of course, a whole lot more...
</ul>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>How is it done?</h2>

 As in Japanese cooking, it's all in the slicing.
<p>

 After receiving the groove from the sampler, ReCyc:le! analyzes it (using Digital Signal Processing methods) and breaks it
 up into its rhythmic components.  Each is called a "slice".
<p>

 The process itself is fully automated, but the amount of slices and their "thickness" is controlled by you, using on-screen
 controls and tools.
<p>

 Then, ReCycle! assigns each slice to a MIDI note number, creates a key map and transmits the whole package back to
 the sampler as sample files and a program file.  Each slice can now be triggered individually from its own key on your
 MIDI keyboard.
<p>

 But that's not all.  From the original groove, ReCycle! creates a MIDI file ready for importing into Cubase - or other
 sequencer.  When played back, it triggers each slice in turn, retaining the timing of the original groove.
 Now your groove is under complete MIDI control, while remaining rhythmically intact!
<p>

  Need to change the tempo? just do it!  When the groove is sliced (and stretched if necessary) it'll play back perfectly at
 almost any tempo.  If it doesn't, just edit or quantize it like any MIDI recording.  Since each slice has its own note number,
 programming a fill is no more difficult than doing it with sounds from a drum machine.  You can silence certain hits or
 use Velocity data to control the dynamics of the groove.  And so on...
<p>

 And of course, there is a lot of fun to be had by using the editing functions in your sampler.  You can retune the sounds,
 replace them with others, or send them to individual outputs for external processing (why not add some reverb to the
 snare only?).  You can change the decay of the samples to alter the ambience, or even use other audio processing
 software for further redesign.
<p>

<h2>How do I use ReCycle!?</h2>
                                                                                             
   A good answer is "instinctively". 
<p>
    ReCycle! is a decidedly non-technical piece of software.  Its menu choices are deceptively few, and its graphic interface is
   clear and user-friendly.  Most processes are fully automated.  Smart analysis algorithms handle the slicing.  The loop position
   markers snap to musically "intelligent" positions in the sound.  You can set the loop positions while auditioning the sound, so
   your ears will tell you when you got it right!
<p>
   Uploading a loop from your sampler, and downloading the resulting slices and program, is a completely automated process.

<p>
<hr><p>
   <h2>You need to ReCycle!</h2>
   Perhaps you have stayed away from using sampled grooves because it  
                                                                             
  seems too technical? An arcane DJ-ing art, beyond the grasp of ordinary      Support for the Ensoniq EPSIEPS 16+

  ivory-tinkling mortals?
<p>
   ReCycle! will make this exciting technique available to you in an intuitive and transparent manner.

   Or maybe you're one of those who think that using

   loops is the aural equivalent of painting

   by numbers?  Then think again.  With ReCycle!

   you have as much musical control over a

   sampled loop as you do with MIDI recording.

   But what if you're a seasoned groove master,

   perhaps with many years of experience?                                              

   Well, then we suggest you read the ReCycle!   
   limenu" once more.  Consider carefully what

   new possibilities each function would give you.

   We're pretty sure you'll find it exciting..

<h1>Autocom MDX 1200</h1>
<h2>Interactive 2-Channel Compressor/Limiter/Expander/Enhancer</h2><hr>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>For increasing vocal energy and penetration live and in the studio
<li>For compressing any mono or stereo signal without the usual loss of higher frequencies due to bass 'pumping'
<li>Perfect for PA systems, and Broadcast, TV or Recording studio
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><blink>New!</blink> Dynamic Enhancer</h3>

How did you imagine your mix
would sound before you began
your painstaking efforts!
Is something still missing, but
you can't quite put your finger
on it! One reason could be that
compression, particularly when
applied heavily, can dull the
sound of your signal. Because
energy is concentrated at the
lower end of the frequency
spectrum, bass tones, and
especially transients, tend to
dominate the action of any
broadband compressor. Thus
bass peaks also cause higher
frequencies to be unavoidably
attenuated, resulting in
unwanted muffling of the
programme material. Engineers
have had to live with this
problem for decades. With our
revolutionary AUTOCOM
MDX 1200 we have developed
a special system which
counteracts this adverse side-
effect of compression. Now, the
all-new AUTOCOM comes
complete with our new
Dynamic Enhancer circuitry,
which has been designed to
ensure that your music retains
its brightness no matter how
much compression you apply.
Above the Compression
threshold, our dynamic
Enhancer boosts the high
frequency energy content to a
degree which depends on the
amount of instantaneous Gain
Reduction applied, leaving your
mix, like your original idea,
fresh and full of life.
<hr>
<h3>IRC (Interactive Ratio
Controller) Expander/Gate</h3>

As on the COMPOSER, the
AUTOCOM now comes with
our innovative IRC (Interactive
Ratio Control) super-musical
Expander/Gate.
<hr>
<h3>Auto and Manual
Compressor Modes</h3>

In Auto Mode, programme-
dependent Attack and Release
times are calculated in real
time, necessitating minimal
setting-up while giving you
optimal performance,
particularly with complex
signals like vocals, or the mix.
In addition, Manual Mode offers
you fully adjustable Attack and
Release for creative effects.
<hr>
<h3>Mode/Application Table</h3>

<ol>
<li>Auto: For vocals, mixdown, stringed instruments
<li>Manual: For percussive sounds and envelope shaping
</ol>
<hr>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Interactive Stereo Dynamic Processor
<li>Auto and Manual Mode Compression
<li>Separate IRC Expander/Gate 
<li>Integrated Dynamic Enhancer
<li>Accurate 8-Point Gain<br>Reduction Meters
<li>2 External Key Inputs
</ul>

<li>Indispensable for studios and PA systems of all shapes and sizes
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>ULTRA-CURVE</h2>
Our DSP 8000 is the first ever audio product to provide all the
processing power and flexibility that 64-bit digital performance
can offer you, together with a signal-to-noise ratio and audio
quality that compares favourably with the very best of analogue
equipment. Incorporating two very powerful 64-bit computers,
and superb quality 20-bit converters, its open-ended architecture
means that upgrades to our existing operating system, and even
completely new functions, may be added at a later date via a user-
replaceable chip. The front panel offers a convenient way of
editing data, which may then be stored in the computer's non-
volatile memory. The inclusion of a MIDI bus enables full real-
time editing from any MIDI controller or sequencer.<hr>

<h3>Stereo 31-band Graphic/Parametric/Notch Filter</h3>
Each of two channels comprises a 31- band digital Auto-Q
Graphic Equalizer offering, for each band, +16 dB in 0.25 dB
steps. Superimposed upon this you also get three bands of full
Parametric Equalization per channel. Because all EQ parameters
are MIDI-editable in real time, programmable and dynamic EQ
effects such as filter frequency sweeping are possible. This will be
of special interest to dance remixers.<hr>

<h3>Filter Section Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ultra-musical Dual 31-band Auto-Q Graphic Equalizer
<li>Additional Shelving Filter with Variable Slope
<li>Additional 6 Bands of Parametric Equalization, with Notch<br>
Filter Bandwidth fine tunable down to 1/60th Octave
<li>Full MIDI Parameter and Snapshot control (Future EQ DESIGN Software will allow full remote control from your PC)
<li>Set-ups can be stored under any name in 100 User Memories
<li>Security Key Password for selective memory protection
<li>EQ Curves may be copied, compared, added and subtracted
<li>Crossfade between settings
<li>Dual mono or stereo operation
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Feedback Eliminator</h3>
Any of 6 Parametric Equalization bands can be set to automatically
seek out and attenuate unwanted feedback frequencies dynamically.
A deep (up to 48 dB) and ultra-narrow (1/60th Octave) notch leaves
the rest of the audio spectrum virtually unchanged. This feature is
particularly effective when dealing with feedback between stage
microphones and FOH or stage monitor speakers. It can also
eliminate any feedback howl, such as that between headphones
and a microphone, or deck turntables and a club PA system.<hr>
<h3>Real Time Analyzer</h3>
A Real Time Analyzer (RTA) is an
invaluable tool for checking the
frequency response characteristics
of concert halls, studio control
rooms etc., or even to check if
the frequency/energy content of
a mix is right for radio or TV
transmission, or for mastering.
<h5>RTA Features</h5>
<ul>
<li>High-resolution Real Time Analyzer with Peak Hold, Variable Integration Time and 10 User Memories
<li>White/Pink Noise/Sine-wave Generator for system alignment
<li>Analyzer Curves may be copied, compared, added and subtracted
<li>Peak or RMS weighting with variable Decay Time
<li>0.25 dB Resolution/31 bands
<li>Choice of any Reference Signal source eg. Microphone, Equalizer etc.
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Auto EQ Alignment using
the Real Time Analyzer</h3>
PA system alignment normally
takes place during the sound-
check in an empty auditorium.
The trouble is, once the audience
has filed in the acoustics alter
dramatically, and resonant
frequencies shift. Now you can
automatically re-equalize your PA
system for a full auditorium, after
the audience has arrived. In
theory you could do it between
songs! With the ULTRA-CURVE
DSP 8000 you can afford the
same sophisticated room
equalization techniques previously
enjoyed only by top professionals.
<hr>
<h3>Additional Functions of
the ULTRA-CURVE</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integral Multiband Limiter with variable Threshold
<li>Integral Digital Noise Gate, with Behringer's unique IRC (Interactive Ratio Control) characteristics
<li>Up to 5 seconds of digital delay may be added to the DSP 8000. Delays can be specified in feet, metres or seconds (Optional)
<li>Ultra-accurate Peak Level Meter with variable Peak Hold and Reference Level selectable -10 dBV, +4 dBu, Digital Max
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>General Features of the
ULTRA-CURVE</h3>

<h1>Morpheus Z-Plane Synthesizer</h1>
<hr><p>
<b>The Morpheus Z-Plane Synthesizer,
 with its revolutionary Z-Plane filters, is unlike
 any MIDI sound module in the history of E-mu.
 In addition to the superb 16-bit sound quality
 and straightforward user interface that E-mu
 modules are famous for, Morpheus' Z-Plane
 technology offers new sounds and expressive
 control that you've never experienced in a
 MIDI instrument.</b>
<p>


        At the heart of Morpheus is E-mu's
 Z-Plane Synthesis technology, that's
 redefining the future of digital sound
 creation. Unlike the simple 2 or 4-pole
 filters of traditional synhcsizers,
 Morpheus has unique 14-pole Z-Plane
 filters that are capable of modeling virtually
 any resonant characteristics and then interpolating (or "morphing") between them in
 real time.  This allows you to manipulate
 sounds in incredible wayls: morph an entire
 section of orchestral strings into full-toned
 chimes- send a piano through the resonances
 of the human vocal tract pronouncing a
 variety of vowels; sweep a synth pad with
 32 polyphonic flangers; use a mod wheel
 to control the subtle timbral changes that
result from picking an acoustic guitar at
  different distances from the bridge. Let
  Morpheus give you the power to create the
  sounds you've only imagined before.
<p>

          Morpheus provides powerful tools for
  controlling the Z-Plane filters, like an enhanced
  version of E-Mu's MIDIPatch Modulation
  System for unmatched real-time control and
  exprressivity, and multi-segment function gener
  ators for microscopic sound sculpting.  The new
  HyperPresct mode lets you split, layer and cross-
   switch between 16 presets at once-for creating
       sounds so thick you can swim in them.

<p>

              Like other E-Mu digital sound
        modules, Morpheus has an impressive
    set of features that give you the freedom to
  experiment.  Start with the ability to play up
  to 32 sounds simultaneously over 16 MIDI
  channels.  Then, add dual stereo effects
  processors and 6 polyphonic outputs for mixing
  and processing versatility.  Combine all this
  power with the industry's clearest, most
  straightforward user interface, and you have
         the synthesizer that will move your
          music into the next century.
<hr>
<h2>What Is Z-Plane Synthesis?</h2>
       Z Plane Synthesis is E-Mu's proprietary technology for providing
  new levels of expressivity and dynamic timbral control of sample
  based waveforms.
<p>

       Conventional synthesizer filters consist of a single section that
  simply lets you attenuate a waveform's harmonic content above a
  single frequency with (in some cases) an optional resonant peak at
  that frequency.  In contrast, a Z-Plane filter consists of seven sections,
  each (very much like a band of parametric EQ) allowing independent
  control of frequency, bandwidth and degree of peak or notch.  As a
  result, Z-Plane Filters can model virtually any resonant characteristic;
  whether that of an acoustic instrument body, the human vocal tract
  or even something that does not exist in nature.
<p>

       This modeling capability alone makes Z-Plane Filters the most
  powerful filters ever available on a commercial synthesizcr.  But their
  real power comes from their ability to smoothly interpolate (or "morph")
  between resonant models.  Whether in response to velocity, pressure,
  or a variety of real time controls, Z-Plane filters let you dynamically
  transform sounds in ways never before possible.  From subtle expressive
 variation to alien mutation, Z-Plane Synthesis gives you access to sounds
 which previously existed only in your imagination.
<hr>
<h2>The Morpheus Function Generator</h2>
       To give you maximum creative control of its Z- Plane filters,
 each Morpheus choice includes (in addition to three traditional
 AHDSR envelope generators) two advanced programmable
 Function Generators.  For each of a Function Generator's eight
 segments vou can specify not only level and rate, but shape (select
 from 64 shapes including Linear, Exponential, Random and Chaos)
 and a Conditional Jump that will cause  a jump to another specified
 segment based on the state of a chosen  parameter (such as velocity
 footswitch position, and note-off, etc.).
<p>

       As part of Morpheus' MIDIPatch modulation system, each
 Function Generator can be assigned to any of 35 real time control
 destinations including filter morphing.

<h1>Monitor One</h1>
<h2>Near Field Studio Reference Monitors</h2>
<hr>
The Alesis Monitor One Near Field Studio Reference Monitor offers excellent
image and transient reproduction, powerful bass and smooth, extended high
frequency detail. Designed by engineers with decades of experience, the TEC
Award-winning Monitor One provides the Iast critical link in the recording studio's slgnal chain; giving you accurate reproduction of what is being recorded.<p>
Most small speakers used for near-field monitoring give disappointing
results in their lowest octave. They ae either sealed enclosures (limiting the
amount of air the driver can move) or have a small vent (whose effect at lower
frequencies is nullified by the effect of turbulence in the port). The Monitor One
overcomes these limitations by using Alesis' exclusive SuperPort speaker
venting technology, which eliminates the "choking" effect of port turbulence,
for solid high-power bass transients and extended low frequency response.
<p>
The Monitor One uses a 1" silk-dome high frequency Driver which is ferrofluid
cooled for improved power handling. The silk dome eliminates the harshness
and ear fatigue associated with metal or plastic tweeters, making long mixing
sessions easier. A proprietary 6.5" low frequency driver with a mineral-filled
polypropylene cone, and a 1.5" voice coil wound on a high-temperature Kapton
former are behind the Monitor One's bass responce.<p> <b>The excellent
sonic quality and widespread popularity of the Moniter One makes it the new
standard for near field studio monitoring.</b>

<h1>Mid Field Reference Monitor</h1>
<hr>
Today's pop and rock music places a strong emphasis on deep, powerful bass grooves, so getting the mix vou want depends as much on
 your ability to feel your sound as it does on how you hear it.  This
 extra   bass     energy
 drives most small near
 field monitors beyond
 their limits.  Adding
 sub-woofers     is    an
 expensive solution, and
 placing them away from
 your main reference
 monitors can destroy
 the critical listening
 image.     With      our
 Monitor One, Alesis set a new standard for powerful bass in a
 near field reference monitor.  Now, our recently introduced Monitor
 Two takes studio monitoring to the next level. The Monitor Two is
 a 10" 3-way design which offers wide frequency response, clear
 musical detail and imaging, accurate transient reproduction, high
power handling capability and a bass punch that is simply not possible from smaller near field monitors.
<p>


                                         The components in the
                                         Monitor Two are similar in
                                         design and construction to
                                         those used in the Monitor
                                         One, which allowed Alesis
                                         engineers to maintain a
                                         similar voicing between
                                         the two models.  The 10"
                                         woofer    and    5     1/4"
                                         midrange drivers use mineral-filled polypropylene
 cones for rigidity and stability.  They have high temperature voice
 coils wound on Kapton formers to enhance their power handling
 capability.'I'he tweeter is a special 1" silk dome design, that ensures
 very little ear fatigue with the same natural, smooth top end
 response as the Monitor One. 
<p>
The Monitor Two utilizes a unique asymmetrical crossover that
 combines second and third order filters, with crossover points at 1.5
 and 6kHz.  'Mis advanced crossover design bridges the gap between
 the deep bass of the woofer and the sizzle of the tweeter while lim-
 iting the amount of phase and amplitude ripple ... a problem often
 associated with three way speaker designs that use less sophisti-
 cated crossover circuitry.
<p>

 The Monitor Two also takes advantage of Alesis' exclusive
 SuperPort venting technology to produce powerful, extended
 bass.  Most speakers used for near and mid-field monitoring give disappointing results in their lowest frequency range.  They are either
 sealed, which limits the amount of air the driver can move, or have
 an undersized vent whose function at low frequencies and high
 acoustic output is nullified by the effect of turbulence in the
 restricted port tube.  The Monitor Two's large SuperPort overcomes
 this limitation by minimizing vent turbulence at the high air velocities created by powerftil bass transients.  This all translates to tighter
 bass with higher definition, the signature of Alesis monitors.  The
 Monitor Two's frequency response is flat from 4OHz to 18kHz, and
 peak power handling is 200 watts.
<p>

 Whether you are looking for a monitor with a wider frequency
 response, or simply need more punch than you can get out of
 smaller studio monitors, the Alesis Monitor Two Mid Field
 Reference Monitor is the right choice.

<h1>Soundscape Multitrack Hard Disk Recorder</h1><hr>
The Soundscape SSHDR1 Multi-track Hard Disk Recorder is a high quality 16 bit digital audio system, which can be used
for both pre and post-production work and can be easily expanded to provide from 8 to 128 tracks of CD quality audio.
The system can be used for recording and composing with MIDI, in a broadcast studio environment for radio program or
jingle arrangement, and also for theatre productions and movie or TV soundtrack recording and editing.
<p>
Each rack mounted unit has 2 track recording and 8 track playback through 4 outputs (configured as 2 stereo pairs), from 64
virtual tracks. As the system is modular, up to 16 rack units can be used together, synchronised with sample rate accuracy,
providing a maximum of 32 inputs, 64 outputs and 128 tracks. This is a standard feature and does not require other software
as with other systems.
<p>
Each unit provides a real-time digital stereo mix of up to 8 tracks from disk and 2 tracks from the analogue or digital inputs.
Fader and pan settings can be changed on-screen or from external controllers in real-time, allowing automated mixing (via
MIDI). With multiple units, an entire stereo mix of all tracks can be produced, completely in the digital domain. The system can
also run as a 4 track, with real-time cross-fading for use with external mixing consoles.
<p>
There are 8 real-time fully parametric digital EQ's per unit and in 4 track mode, the 8 EQ's can be assigned in any combination
to the 4 active tracks. In 8 track mode, 2 tracks can be previewed with all 8 real-time EQ's active and EQ'd takes can be
generated to disk (approximately 4 times faster than real-time).
<p>
Operation is from IBM PC or compatible under Windows 3.1, which makes it possible to run other programs, e.g. a MIDI
sequencer, at the same time (using 386/486 PC only).
<p>
SSHDR1 is currently being used for a wide cross section of audio applications, from recording music in home studios,
up to multiple unit 32 and 48 track systems used by major TV studios for audio post-production linked to video.
Studios with multitrack analogue tape machines can now add digital tracks from SSHDR1 with full chase lock
via SMPTE timecode using a low cost MTC convertor. SSHDR1 can closely follow varispeed from the tape
machine and is frame accurate for use with video. With the release of low cost synchronizers and digital I/0
convertors SSHDR1 can now be used for editing audio tracks from digital multi-track tape machines and the
tape machine can also be used to backup the hard disk.

<h1>Gekko Chords</h1><hr>
Have you ever wondered if there is an easy way to
pump up the flat sound of a keyboard or sound
expander? Wonder no longer, it's simple enough via
Gekko Chords. This device is equipped with just one
button and one LED, and -- as unlikely as it sounds -
just one function. At the touch of a key, it doubies a
chord that you have entered at your keyboard, with
the entire tonal range of your keyboard available for
doubling. Subsequently, you can turn a lonely, sad
low-end tone into an instant, riveting wall of bass by
simply doubling a note several times, transform a
reedy synthesizer ditty into a happening choral tune in
the latest rave style, or turn a thin brasssound into the
heaviest brass section. In the past this feature, then
called "Chord Uemory," was available in some
synthesizers. Now it is back, exclusive1y, in the form of
Cekko Chords <h3>You won't believe your ears; this little
green monster will make your synth sound as if it's on
steroids.</h3>

<h1>Gekko Trigger</h1>
<hr>
This little blue beast also packs quite a wallop. It allows
you to play complex percussive grooves without
entailing that you become an instant tendinitis invalid.
Anyone who hears you play these licks and doesn't
realise you have a Gekko Trigger at hand is going to
think your chops are otherworldly. The trick is actually
very simple: just hook up the Gekko (MIDI ln and MIDI
Out, etc.), press and hold the Gekko's amoebic button
and play the keys you want to trigger on your
keyboard. Then play a chord somewhere else on the
keyboard; it will only sound when you trigger one or
several of the pre-defined keys. This feature is
dynamic, fast and uncomplicated. You can now play
extremely compfex rhythm patterns dynamically
without worrying about chord changes, especially
when you patch in the chords or notes you want to
trigger from a sequencer. Yes, this is also an option.

<h2>Integrated MIDI and Digital Audio Recording for Professionals</h2><hr>
<h3>A Decade of Developing Musical Tools Leads to o New Evolution</h3>

IN THE EARLY 1980'S A SMALL GROUP OF MANUIFACTURERS GOT TOGETHER AND HAMMERED
OUT A LANGUAGE CALLED MIDI (MUSICAL INSTRUMENT DIGITAL INTERFACE), WHICH
ALLOWED SYNTHESIZERS TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. WHAT BEGAN AS AN
ESOTERIC TOOL FOR TECHNlCALLY SAVVY MUSICIANS HAS BECOME A WIDESPREAD
STANDARD FOR COMPOSERS AND PERFORMERS, AND AN INCREASINGLY INTEGRAL
COMPONENT OF DISK-BASED RECORDING, MULTIMEDIA AUTHORINC, AUDIO FOR PICTURE,
AND A WIDENING ARRAY OF OTHER APPLICATIONS. FROM THE BEGINNING OPCODE HAS
PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THIS EVOLUTION. IN 1985 WE INTRODUCED THE FIRST
MACINTOSH-BASED MIDI SEQCUENCERS, LIBRARIANS, AND INTERFACES. THROUGHOUT THE
80'S WE REFINED AND DIVERSIFIED OUR PRODUCT LlNE, LAUNCHlNG PRODUCTS THAT RAN
THE GAMUT FROM PROFESSIONAL SEQUENCING PACKAGES TO ENTRY LEVEL MIDI SYSTEMS.
DURING THIS TIME PERIOD WE ALSO DEVELOPED THE STANDARD MIDI FlLE AND OMS
(OPEN MCISIC SYSTEM), BOTH OF WHICH BECAME STANDARDS OF THE COMPUTER/MUSIC
INDUSTRY. IN 1990 OPCODE LAUNCHED STUDIO VISION, AN INTEGRATED MIDI
SEQUENCING AND DIGITAL AUDIO RECORDING SOFTWARE PACKAGE. FOR THE FIRST TIME
MUSICIANS HAD ACCESS TO A UNIFIED WORKPLACE WITH A MUSICAL USER-INTERFACE.
THE RESPONSE TO STUDIO VISION WAS OVERWHELMING, OPENING UP A NEW CHAPTER IN
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AT OPCODE, INSPIRING US TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IN THE AREAS
OF AUDIO/MIDI INTEGRATION, INTER-APPLICATION COMMUNICATION, AND OF COURSE,
AS ALWAYS, MUSICALLY INTUITIVE INTERFACES. STUDIO VISION PRO 3.0 IS THE
FULFILLMENT OF THESE EFFORTS, PUSHING THE INTEGRATION ENVELOPE TO NEW HEIGHTS
lN ORDER TO PRODUCE A MORE CREATIVE AND MUSICAL WORKPLACE.<hr>
<h3>Effortless Access To Powerful, Musical Tools</h3>
Studio Vision Pro gives you the ability to
display and manipulate information in a
myriad of musically meaningful ways.
It makes technology transparent -- letting you
work intuitively, and fostering your creativity.
<p>
Studio Vision Pro is a comprehensive, integrated
suite of software with a diversity of abilities that
defy the boundaries of a printed brohure.
<p>
What follows is a brief overview. To truly
understand the depth and power of
Studio Vision Pro, you'll just have to
put it to work on your next project.
<hr>
At the heart of Studio Vision Pro lies a
deceptively simple <b>Control Bar</b>, with familiar
recorder-like transport controls and quick-click
icons. Compact, yet easy-to-navigate, the
Control Bar gives you instant access to the
five main editing windows: Sequences, Track
Overview, List, Piano Roll and Notation.
It shows Record Status and location in bars,
beats and SMPTE time code, and has a Marker
location pop-up menu, as well as autolocate
buttons, punch points and much more.
<hr>
Like a tape recorder's
autolocator, <b>Markers</b>
let you store and
recall any location --
even while playing.
You can set Markers
by bar or SMPTE
location.
<hr>
<b>Sequences.</b> Studio Vision lets
you have a practically unlimited
number of sequences within a file. Use
pattern or linear sequencing or both
simultaneously. Structure each musical
passage, intro, verse, or chorus as
a separate sequence. Then using a
user-definable keystroke, trigger them
on-the-fly -- for a fast, easy way to
audition song structures.
<hr>
The <b>Track Overview</b> is a "global information center"
for your MIDl and audio tracks and provides a wealth
of user feedback and control. Track Overview lets you
see the contours of your music by faithfully
representing audio waveforms as well as MIDI data.
<hr>
In <b>Phrases Mode</b>, you can define each track's detail
level as well as "silence length." With this unique
feature, MIDI events that occur close in time are
considered one block. MIDI events that are separated
by a predetermined length of silence, however, are
allocated into separate blocks.
<hr>
Alternately, tracks can be viewed in <b>Block Mode</b>,
which allows you to size blocks instantly in sections
as small as an 8th note, or as large as 16 bars.
<b>Tracks Mode</b> displays tracks as a single block.
A "Plug Selection" option lets you select any phrase
or block and play it instantly. You can cut, copy,
paste, or delete any part of a MIDI or audio track
-- or double-click on a block to go to another
editing screen.
<hr>
<b>Drag-and-Drop Editing.</b> Studio Vision Pro provides full drag-and-
drop editing capabilities in all editing windows. In Graphic Editing,
simply position the cursor over any MIDI note, and grab the note to
lengthen its duration, change its start time, or change its pitch. Hold
the option key and you can automatically make a
copy of the original item, leaving it
in place as you position
the copy.
<hr>
Studio Vision Pro's <b>Piano Roll</b> provides a
fast, intuitive wag to view, select, and edit
MIDI data. You can easily see the order,
length, and pitch of each note -- in a way
that is musically meaningful, but doesn't
require you to read music. Digital audio
events can also be edited here
nondestructively -- and both MIDI
and audio can be scrubbed for precise
editing locations.
<hr>
Studio Vision Pro's integrated
<b>Notation Editing</b> window allows
you to display any number of
tracks in standard music notation,
with user-definable time signa-
tures, song keys, and more. You
can prep and adjust files in the
Print Preview window, and then
print out parts. For advanced nota-
tion capabilities, any Studio Vision
Pro file can be opened directly into
Opcode's Overture -- a full-
fledged music publishing
package.
<hr>
<b>Quantize.</b> "Tighten" your project to the
nearest boundary, for playback only,
or permanently. Use Grid Quantize with
evenly spaced boundaries, or Groove
Quantize, which allows you to tighten
data based upon another performance.
You can easily create and edit your own
grooves or use Studio Vision Pro's stock
Grooves, including Akai MPC-60 and Linn
9000 drum machine templates, or the 50
free "DNA" Grooves. Musicians will
appreciate the "humanity" that Groove
Quantize can add to tracks.
<hr>
<b>Digital Audio Recording & Editing.</b>
For recording and editing audio files,
Studio Vision Pro has everything you 
would expect in a high-end digital
audio workstation.
<p>
Audio track editing is nondestructive,
so you can always undo or modify an
edit later if you change your mind.
Within the Track Overview window,
the start and end of any audio event 
can be "trimmed," to hear more or less
of the associated audio file. And of 
course any audio event can be moved, 
copied, duplicated, cut, and pasted.
<p>
Mixing audio tracks is as simple as selecting part (or all)
of the tracks or events and then choosing Mix. Pan and
Volume information may be retained for each track, and
there's never any signal quality degradation -- so you
can mix as many times as you like.
<hr>
<b>Mixing Consoles.</b> Studio Vision Pro's mixing and monitoring sections have all the
features you would expect in a professional recording package, plus some unique
features you won't find anywhere else. Use the "Build From Selected Tracks"
command and you get a console for the audio and MIDI tracks you have selected!
You can choose between a narrow-module console, to fit the maximum number of
tracks on screen, or a wide-module console with TDM inserts, remote devices, and
stereo VU Meters.
<hr>
The <b>Record Monitor</b> window has accurate
peak-hold meters with a VU weighting, so it's
easy to set the proper level without guessing.
Also displayed are available record time (based
upon hard disk space), input select, and audio
thru select. Advanced Recording features allow
you to Append Record a file or topunch-in to
an existing track.
<hr>
Once you've converted an audio file to
MIDI, you can select the <b>Notation Window</b>
and edit your digital audio file as a score
before converting it back to audio, or print
out a part for vocalists and musicians who
will be performing harmonies or fills.
<hr>
<b>Shifting Pitch</b> is a simple
musical operation with Studio
Vision Pro 3.0. Just select the
musical interval and Studio
Vision does the rest. There is
even a fine-tuning adjustment
that lets you enter values
in cents.
<hr>
Using the <b>Time Scale</b> dialog,
you can control audio time
compression or expansion
musically -- in bars and
beats -- or use SMPTE to
map start and stop times.
<hr>
<h3>Musical Editing for Digital Audio</h3>
As incredible as it sounds,
Studio Vision Pro 3.0
really does let you edit
digital audio as if it were a MIDI
sequence. It also lets you map
digital audio to MIDI -- so that
the audio follows MIDI beautifully,
expressively, and musically.
<p>
Take a good look at Studio Vision Pro
3.0's new DSP Menu. At first glance it
may seem familiar, the items at the
top -- Normalize, Reverse, Invert
Phase, Sample Rate Conversion and
EQ -- are common features of many
disk-based recording systems. As you
move down the menu you'll notice
features you've never seen in any
digital audio recording or MIDI
sequencing package, features which
unlock a new universe of musical
possibilities. Studio Vision's on-board
DSP functions don't require any
external devices or add-on cards --
and they're "constructive" creating
a new file; always retaining your
original file.
<p>
Select <b>Audio-to-MIDI</b>, and Pro 3.0 will open a dialog
box which allows you optimize your Audio-to-MIDl
conversion. A pop-up template menu lets you set
defaults for the entire dialog box based upon the
characteristics of the audio event you are going to
convert. Then Pro 3.0 opens a window which shows
both the digital audio and a new MIDI representation
(piano roll, notation, strip chart, etc.) of the same file.
<p>
You can edit this file using any of the views or tools
that you might normally use to edit MIDl sequences!
Fix a bad vocal note, create a distinctive vocal harmony
line, or change the tempo of a rhythm guitar part. When
you're finished editing MIDI parameters, simply choose
<b>MIDI-to-Audio</b> and choose which MIDI parameters will
be applied to your original audio performance. Click OK
and the program will construct a new digital audio file
which includes your edits. The possibilities are limited
only by your imagination.
<hr>
<h3>Integrated System Highlights - OMS 2.0 & Galaxy, The Universal Librarian</h3>

<h5>As you can see, Studio Vision Pro 3.0
is much more than a sequencing
and digital audio recording package.
It's an entirely new system for approaching
the audio/musical workplace, that will
change the way you think about audio.
<p>
Bundled with Studio Vision Pro 3.0 are two highly integrated programs that will simplify
your life: OMS 2.0, the Open Music
System and Galaxy, The Universal
Librarian. OMS 2.0 makes studio setup easy.
Step-by-step prompts help you identify,
name, end associate your studio gear with
icons for quick reference. Once you're set
up, 0MS lets you access and organize your
studio quickly, without having to remember
details such as channel assignments and
port numbers.<p>
Additionally, OMS
integrates with Galaxy,
a program that lets you
store your patches, and
organize them in banks,
bundles, and libraries.
<p>
Using OMS' flexible Name Browser, you can access all of the patches in your Galaxy files by name, 
number, or keyword -- even beyond
the "128 limitation" normally imposed by MIDI
program changes!</h5>
<hr>

<h3>Applications and Software Compatibility</h3>

<h4>Why Use Studio Vision Pro?</h4>

Opcode's Studio Vision made history in 1990, as the first program
to integrate MIDI and audio recording. This latest incarnation affirms
that it remains the hest. Put simply, no other program offers so much
control, over so many facets of music and sound production, and with
so much ease, as Studio Vision Pro 3.0

<h4>MUSIC RECORDING --
FAST SESSIONS, SEAMLESS EDITS, FLAWLESS PERFORMANCES</h4>
Studio Vision Pro's slick, unified interface handles tracking, editing, DSP effects,
mixing, and more. Check out remarkable features such as: Integrated MIDI and
audio -- no waiting for sync lock-up! Seamlessly pitch correct single notes or
passages. Compile multiple takes into one. Convert audio to MIDI (record the
sound of a thigh being slapped, and moke it a perfectly timed snare drum! }.
Quantize rhythm guitar and other ports. Transpose MIDI sequences --
and make the audio match. Create instant harmonies. Adjust the tempo of audio
tracks to match MIDI tempos, without changing the pitch! External time code sync
lets you fly frocks off tape into Studio Vision Pro for editing or DSP, and then hack
onto reel or cassette. <b>The list goes on, but why keep reading about it?
Studio Vision Pro is ready to track when you are -- see for yourself
exactly what it has contributed to scores of hit records.</b>

<h4>SCORING, COMPOSITION, SONGWRITING, & ARRANGING --
TAP INTO UNLIMITED CREATIVE POTENTIAL</h4>
Everyone in the business of making melodies dreams about the day when what's
heard in the head can instantly become a musical reality. Studio Vision Pro brings that
day all that much closer: Sing or hum a melody; have Studio Vision Pro play it
back as whatever MIDI instrument you choose. Supplement MIDI tracks with real
instruments or vocals. Enhance any audio track with a parallel or harmony MIDI
part. Scoring to picture? Transfer workprint audio into your session, and you'll get
to compose with dialogue and sound effects in place. Capture the workprint's video
as a QuickTime movie (or ask your video editor for a QuickTime cut) -- get instant,
accurate visual references, without waiting for video decks to shuttle and lock.
Automatically separate a rap into individual words -- then stutter them, overlap
them, double them, harmonize them! Pitch correct any audio. <b>And when you're all
done, creating a professional multi-part notation score is as simple as opening your
session into Opcode's new Overture program.</b>

<h4>AUDIO POST-PRODUCTION FOR FILM & VIDEO --
SPEAK YOUR EFFECTS TO SPOT THEM AND OTHER AMAZING TRICKS</h4>
<b>While many of Hollywood's leading audio engineers, editors, and sound designers
have discovered the power of Studio vision Pro, its new capabilities let you go
beyond what you would have imagined possible:</b> Integration of sample-triggered
MIDI events and audio tracks within the same file. Cue list-type entry and editing
of MIDI events. "Electronic Foley" capabilities for spotting MIDI-triggered samples
to QuickTime movies or external video. Speedy, nondestructive multi-take
recording (great for ADRS. Text-based markers for "informed" autolocating and
spotting. Watch the picture while you record your voice and say different sound
effects, such as "gun shot," "door squeak," or "footstep" -- and then, incredibly,
use Studio Vision Pro to replace your voice automatically with your desired effects!
<b>Any way you cut it, audio Vision Pro means post as you never imagined it.
</b>
<h4>MULTIMEDIA FRODUCTION -- THE DEVELOPER'S DREAM TOOL</h4>
<b>Studio Vision Pro is ideal for multimedia development, offering:</b> Recording,
editing, processing and mixing of every audio element, including voiceovers, audio
soundtracks, MIDI soundtracks, and sound effects. For team-based development,
composers can provide completed MIDI or audio files for instant import. Mixes can
be exported (with or without sample rate conversion) to authoring programs and
video editing systems, including the Avid Media Composer and the Data Translations
Media 100. Accurate synchronization to QuickTime movies. <b>For everything from
games, to CD-R0M books, to authored presentations, Studio Vision Pro is your
one-stop-audio-shop.</b>

<h4>BROADCAST PRODUCTION -- ON TNE AIR, ON-TIME, AND ON-TRACK</h4>
<b>Today's broadcastinp business makes serious demands on your production
capabilities, and Studio Vision Pro has the solutions you need:</b> Fast, easy, accurate
audio waveform editing. From mono to 32 simultaneous tracks. On-air talent
can have instant playback access to thousands of sound effects. Use layered tracks
and built-in signal processing to create new spots that sound ten times as good, in a

<h1>PROPHECY Solo Synthesizer</h1>
<hr>

<h3>Ground breaking sounds in a new instrument with so much control it blows the limits off creative expression.</h3>
<hr>
Thanks to the newly developed Multi-Oscillator
    Synthesis System (MOSS) based on DSP technology,
    the 37-key Prophecy combines stunning dynamic
    synthesizer sound with responsive and expressive
    control-giving musicians the sounds they've been
    waiting for.
<p>

      The Prophecy combines powerful monophonic
    synthesizer sounds with an unprecedented degree of
    expressive control.  The Prophecy utilizes five
    different synthesis methods, including Analog and
    Physical Modeling, plus seven different dynamic
    effect algorithms for signal processing.  This gives you
    an incredible palette to create a dynamic array
    sounds.  The Prophecy Solo Synthesizer adds more
    power and expressivity to your current keyboard
    system and gives you the sonic flexibility of having
    just the right tool for the right job.
<p>
<h2>Five different synthesis models give you
          enormous sonic shaping and expressive
          power.</h2>
<p>

       <b> Unlike conventional synthesizers which use only a single tone
   generation method, the Prophecy utilizes sophisticated Multi-Oscillator
   DSP Synthesis technology, which combines five different synthesis
   niodels-iiicluding DSP, Analog and Phvsical Modeling.  And, the
   oscillators can be arranged in twelve different combinations to produce a
   wide variety of sounds with distinct characteristics.</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li><b>Standard Oscillator for Analog Synth Sounds</b><br>
        With a special new Multi-Mode Resonant Filter, the standard oscillator
  setting on the Prophecy provides classic synthesizer sounds such as synth
  bass, lead, filter sweep sounds and many others.  We've also included
     Portamento plus a special, new Multi-mode Filter.

<li><b>Noise + Comb Filtering</b><br>
        This oscillator setting extracts pitch elements from white noise, letting
     you tap into a wide range of timbres.  This is particularly suited for
     producing spectruin-type sounds, special effects and unique sounds with
     rich harmonic content.

<li><b>VPM (Variable Phase Modulation)</b><br>
        Using phase modulation, this oscillator setting gives you precise
    control over waveforin shapes allowing you to change the harmonic
     content of sounds.

<li><b>Cross/Ring Modulation and Sync</b><br>
        Cross Modulation and Ring Modulation oscillator settings produce a
     wide range of- bell, metallic and claiigorous sounds.  The Sync setting can
     be used to create a variety of vintage synth sounds.

<li><b>Physical Modeling</b><br>
 Physical Modeling is the latest and most sophisticated tone generation
     method.  Each of tfie three settings provides the extraordinarily broad
    titilbral range that can only be created by Physical Modeling.
<ul>
<li><i>Brass Model Oscillator</i><br>
     This simulates brass instruments such as trumpet and trombone, and is
     capable of producing trumpet bends/fall-offs, trombone slides, and fine
     control of air pressure and tone.
<li><i>Reed Model Oscillator</i><br>
       This simulates woodwind instruments such as saxophone and flute,
     and lets you control lip pressure, growl, air pressure and tone shaping.
<li> <i>Plucked String Model Oscillator</i><br>
      This simulates plucked string instruments such as acoustic or electric
     guitar and bass.  This setting gives you detailed, expressive control over
     various picking and slap techniques.
</ol>
</ul>
<h2>Intuitive editing Fontrols for creating any
        sound you imagine.
</h2>
        The oscillator section provides the fundamental sonic building
   blocks of the Prophecy.  This basic sound is then processed in order by
   the following blocks: Wave Shaping, Mixer, Filter & Amp and an effects
   section which has seven effects, including Distortion, Wah, Dual
   Parametric EQ and a choice of Chorus/Flanger+Delay or Reverb.
        Each program can have its own dynamic effects settings that you
   can control in real time using the keyboard dynamics, modulation wheel
   or ribbon controller.  There are 128 impressive program sounds on board,
   and programs you create on the Prophecy can be saved to or loaded from
   optional SRC-512 RAM memory cards.
<p>


            <h2> Real-time Controllers for Exceptionally
                         live Performance.
</h2>
        Virtually all the parameters of the Prophecv can be controlled in real
   time, either by elements such as the Envelope Generator and LFO, or by
   performance controllers such as the ribbon, modulation wheel, and pitch
   bend wheel.  Each program can have its own independent controller
   settings, so you can customize each sound to match your own playing style.
        In addition, the Programmable
   Performance Editor allows you to
   assign certain parameters to be
   controlled from the panel as
   you're playing.  There's even a
   Programmable Arpeggiator
   which lets you freely program
   arpeggio     patterns      and
   synchronize them to MIDI
   clock.  You can also control
   various functions, such as
   program up and down, by using
   the optional EC5 foot pedal.

<hr>

        <b>All in all, this keyboard will
   forever change the way you think about
   synthesizers. The new Prophecy breaks      the boundaries of conventional
   synthesis with its cutting-edge technology, giving musicians the power to
   create and perform with sounds of enormous impact and expressive depth.

<h1>Virtual Analog Rack</h1>
<hr>
<h2>CONTROL PANEL</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>AMPLIFIER, GAIN</b>
Attack, decay, sustain and release.  That's what you need to shape a nice envelope.  The Nord tracks
smoothly without any stepping effects or digital glitches.  Programmable volume.
<li><b>OSC 1</b>
Offers Triangle, saw and pulse waveforms.  The pulse-width is adjustable.
<li><b>OSC 2</b>
Offers Triangle, saw and pulse, with adjustable width, wave forms.  The pitch can be set 5 octaves below
to 5 octaves above Osc 1 pitch.  The Oscillator can also be set to act as a noise source with a noise color
controller.
<li><b>SYNC</b>
Synching the Osc 1 to Osc 2 makes it possible to do varlous effects like the typical "bow" sounds.
<li><b>FM AMOUNT</b>
Combine the best of two worlds, the analog with the digital, in one synthesizer!  Nord Lead offers "Linear-
deep FM".  Warm analog sounds can easily be combined with or changed to FM type of sounds.
<li><b>PULSE WIDTH</b>
Nord Lead offers a true pulse-width modulation.  Perfect for soft string pads.
<li>MIX
Blend the two Oscillators according to your taste.
<li><b>LFO 1</b>
Modulate the pitch on Oscillator 1 and 2 or only Oscillator 2 with a Triangle, Sawtooth or Random
sawtooth.  Use the same wave forms to modulate the filter.  One extraordinary feature of the Nord Lead is
its ability to perform true "pulse-width modulation".  Nord Lead is the first digital keyboard on the market
that offers true modulation of the pulse-width.  A must for your string pads.
<li><b>LFO 2 / ARPEGGIATOR</b>
Play those exciting arpeggiator licks again.  Or use this section to modulate the amplifier or the pitch.
<li><b>MOD ENV</b>
This is a special feature.  It's an extra AD envelope to control the pitch of Oscillator 2, to produce e.g.
typical "bow" sounds, or to let FM to modulate the sound.  You can also use it to produce click and noise
effects.
<li><b>VELOCITY PROG</b>
This is one of the most exciting editing parameters for the Nord rack.  Any parameter, controlled by a
knob, can be velocity dependent, For example; let a soft string pad become a funky clavinet sound through
keyboard dynamics.
<li><b>THE MANUAL BUTTON</b>
When you push this button, you can edit a new sound from scratch.
<li><b>PROGRAM</b>
The Nord Lead comes with 99 sounds and 100 performances.  An expanded Nord rack with an inserted
PCMCIA RAM card can hold an additional 297 sounds and 300 performances.
<li><b>PERFORMING SECTION</b>
Play 4 different synthesizers simultaneously!  It's possible with the Nord rack.  As you can see you have
four sound slots; A, B, C and D. Play them separately or layer them together You can use the Morph
function to blend all 4 slots with each other to create astonishing basses, leads and pads.
<li><b>UNISON</b>
Press this button to "widen and expand" the sound.  Unison mono fattens the sound even more. The unison
"detune" effect is also adjustable.
<li><b>POLY, LEGATO, MONO</b>
Playing modes.
<li><b>PORTAMENTO</b>
Adjust the portamento rate with the knob.  In Auto, portamento works only with legate playing.
<li><b>OCTAVE SHIFT</b>
Selects the basic octave for each sound.
<li><b>FILTER</b>
Attack, decay, sustain and release.  The envelope acts fast and smoothly without any stepping effect or
digital glitches.
<li><b>FILTER TYPE</b>
Nord offers 4 different filters.  Besides the two most common types, LowPass 12 dB and LowPass 24 dB,
there are also HighPass and Band Pass filters.
<li><b>FREQUENCY</b>
Change the timbre of the sound with total sound control.  No stepping effects or glitch problems.
<li><b>RESONANCE</b>
Let the filter ring!
<li><b>ENVELOPE AMOUNT</b>
Sets the filter contour to your sounds.
<li><b>VELOCITY, KBD TRACK</b>
Control the filter envelope by velocity.  The filter frequency follows the keyboard range.
</ol>
<hr><p>
<h4>VIRTUAL ANALOG</h4>
... combines classic ideas with today's technology.  This rack has it all... and more.  Awesome leads,
booming basses, frantic techno atyour fingertips.  Every function has a knob.  No more menus!  Total real time
control and instant accessibility make it a breeze to shape the sounds exactly the way you want them.  Play with
the filter and resonance knob and enjoy the precise tracking and the superb sound quality.  You can program
any parameter change to velocity and do your licks. <p>

<h4>MIDI</h4>
Let's go MIDI Triggering!  In the studio, the Nord Rrack offers real time MIDI recording of the knob settings and
special "MIDI patches" to recreate many of the effects produced by external patching on traditional units.  For
example, let your pre-recorded drumpattem trigger filter and amplifier envelopes, where the Hi-hat pattern
triggers the filter envelope and the Kickdrum pattern simultaneously triggers the amplifier envelope.  Use Nord
rack in this way and you'll be able to create fascinating poly-rhythmic patterns. The programmable velocity
function can also be controlled from a separate MIDI source.  All MIDI triggefing can be done from separate
programmable MIDI channels.  The Nord rack's LFO's and the arpeggiator can be synched to a MIDI clock.
<p>

<h4>FOUR SYNTHESIZERS IN ONE!</h4>
There are four parts which are directly accessible from the front panel.  This makes it possible to instantly
create layers with up to four different sounds, where each separate sound in the layer can easily be edited in
real time.  Make up super patches in the Performance section.  Create monster basses and mega pads.  But
it doesn't stop here.  The sounds in a layer can be programmed by the special Morph function making it
possible to fade sounds and parameters and create an unlimited number of exciting patches.

<h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3>
<h4>Sound generation</h4>
Nord rack Is the first digital synthesizer to use "Virtual Analog Synthesis".  Clavia has analyzed analog
synthesizer design in detail and implemented the research in a digital model.  Nord rack employs matemathical
simulations of the electronical signal generated by analog oscillators, instead of using waveform tables.  This
makes it possible, for example, to sweep the pitch smoothly over a very wide range and allow for true pulse
width modulation.

<h4>Voices</h4>
4 voices expandable to 12. 4 part multi-timbral

<h4>Special features</h4>
Velocity programming.. Each function, controlled by a knob, can be programmed to velocity.  Morphing: Each
function, controlled by a knob, can also be controlled by the modulation wheel / pedal to continuously fade
between two values.

<h4>User interface</h4>
2 digit display, 26 knobs and 19 buttons for program editing.
<h4>Oscillator section</h4>
Two oscillators generating triangle, sawtooth or pulse (with adjustable width) waveforms.  Oscillator 2 can also
generate noise with a color control Oscillator 2 can be hard "synched' to oscillator 1. Linear deep frequency
modulation of osc 1 from osc 2.
<h4>Filter section</h4>
12 dB "2 pole" lowpass, 24 dB "4 pole" lowpass, bandpass or highpass.  Cut off, resonance, envelope amount,
envelope amount controlled by velocity, keyboard tracking and A DSR envelope.
<h4>Amplifier section</h4>
ADSR envelope, gain control.
<h4>Modulation section</h4>
LFO 1 generating triangle, saw or random routed to Osc 1+2, Osc 2, filter or pulse-width.  LFO 2 produces
a triangle waveform, routed to Osc 1 and 2 or amplifier It also controls the rate for the arpeggiator.
Arpeggiator: Range: 1 - 4 octave.  Modes: up, down, upldown.  Modulation envelope (attack, decay) for osc
2 pitch or FM amounl
<h4>Performance section</h4>
Play mode: Poly, legate, mono, unison mono, unison poly.  Manual mode, Four program slots for layering
possibilities.  Portamento / auto portamento.

<h3>Dr. J.R.G. Schuur :"Appelscha. Bolwerk van anarchisme en
radicaal socialisme"</h3>

<b>Stichting Stellingwarver Schrieversronte Oosterwolde 1996</b>


<h1>IN APPELSCHA STREDEN ANARCHISTEN TEGEN VEENBAZEN</h1>

"De anarchisten - en zeker die in Appelscha - waren in wezen
goedwillende mensen die afkerig waren van elke vorm van ge-
weld. Wat zij hoofdzakelijk wilden was met woorden overtuigen.
Die boodschap hoop ik in dit boek alsnog te hebben overge-
bracht."
<p>Met deze regels besluit de historicus Dr. J.R.G. Schuur zijn
onlangs verschenen studie "Appelscha. Bolwerk van anarchisme
en radicaal socialisme". Wel, de boodschap is overgekomen.
Schuur, die woont in Assen en als geschiedenisleraar werkt in
Oosterwolde, schrijft vol sympathie over de Appelschaaster
anarchisten en hun strijd om een beter bestaan. Een aantal van
deze mensen sprak hij nog persoonlijk. Ze zijn hoogbejaard,
dus het was `nu of nooit'. Daarnaast (en vooral) is zijn boek
gebaseerd op schriftelijke bronnen, waaronder "De Klok", de
krant van Geert van der Zwaag, een socialistische politicus
die in Zuid-Oost Friesland aan populariteit alleen onderdeed
voor Domela Nieuwenhuis, en het verslag van de in 1890 van
staatswege ingestelde enquetecommissie die de levensomstandig-
heden in Noord- en Oost-Nederland onderzocht.

<p>Appelscha is allang niet meer een  anarchistisch bolwerk. Wel
een anarchistisch bedevaartsoord, dankzij de Pinksterkampen,
die elk jaar nog steeds anarchisten uit het hele land trekken.
Schuur beschrijft hoe het zo gekomen is en een onpartijdig
historicus probeert hij daarbij niet te zijn. Zijn  afkeer
voor de onbarmhartige heersende klasse, die zich weinig gele-
gen liet liggen aan de nood van de arbeidersbevolking, steekt
hij niet onder stoelen of banken. Maar ook de anarchistische
beweging spaart hij niet. Omdat ze zulke hoge eisen stelde aan
haar leden hield ze een sectarisch karakter. Men mocht niet
drinken, liever ook niet dansen, men moest dienst weigeren en
niet uit zijn op eigen gewin. Zondigen tegen de leer betekende
heibel. Ten tijde van de Spaanse burgeroorlog raakte de bewe-
ging verscheurd, omdat een deel van de aanhang een uitzonde-
ring maakte op de anti-militaristische stelregel.<br>
De beweging bleef alleen al door deze zelfopgelegde beperkin-
gen klein en ver verwijderd van haar einddoel: opstand van de
massa tegen het kapitalisme. Dat ze, anders dan de sociaalde-
mocratische SDAP en later ook de communistische CPN, niet
meedeed aan verkiezingen, was een andere handicap. Tegen de
SDAP hebben de anarchisten van Appelscha zich overigens prima
kunnen handhaven, zo blijkt uit Schuurs relaas. In de jaren
dertig legden ze echter tegen de CPN het loodje. Met die tijd
stopt ook Schuurs beschrijving.

<p>Wat maakte nu juist Appelscha tot dat anarchistenbolwerk ?
Schuur verklaart het deels uit de beroerde omstandigheden,
waaronder de bevolking van het dorp in Ooststellingwerf vanaf
eind vorige eeuw tot aan de Tweede Wereldoorlog leefde. In
Appelscha waren ze er nog slechter aan toe dan in de andere
dorpen van de gemeente. het was het grootste dorp van de
gemeente, maar een dokter hadden ze niet.<br>
Er was geen ziekenfonds, er heerste analfabetisme en kinderar-
beid was gewoon. Het was een typisch arbeidersdorp met een
eenzijdige gerichtheid op het veen. Zolang de veenarbeiders en
hun meewerkende familie niet ziek waren, konden ze het hoofd
net boven water houden. Maar bij tegenslag was er meteen
honger. De winters, als er niet op het veen gewerkt werd,
waren zwaar. In de strenge winters van '88,'91 en '93 moet de
toestand wanhopig geweest zijn. In 1891 slorpte Appelscha naar
verhouding twee keer zoveel van de gemeentelijke armoedekas op
als de andere dorpen. Tussen de beide wereldoorlogen, toen
turf zijn belang had verloren, ging Appelscha door een diep
dal.
<p>
Aan het eind van de winter van '88 brak een grimmige staking
uit. De autoriteiten stuurden er de marechaussee en de infan-
terie op af. Het was een keerpunt in de geschiedenis van het
dorp, dat van toen af een socialistisch bolwerk was. Er werd
een vakbond opgericht, de Eendracht, die meteen een grote
aanhang had en zich later aansloot bij de Sociaal Democrati-
sche Bond van Domela Nieuwenhuis. Er zouden nog heel wat
stakingen volgen. Niet alleen tegen de veenbazen overigens,
maar meermalen ook tegen de slechte arbeidsomstandigheden in
de `werkverschaffing', de werkgelegenheidsprojecten van rege-
ringswege.
<p>
Domela verwierf zijn Appelschaaster aanhang toen hij in '89 in
het dorp kwam spreken. hij was een jaar tevoren tot grote
schrik van de gevestigde orde tot de Tweede Kamer doorgedron-
gen. Daar kreeg hij echter weinig klaar, wat (in '97) leidde
tot zijn bekering tot het anarchisme. ~Appelscha' volgde hem
"in blindelings vertrouwen, want niemand wist wat de nieuwe
leer precies inhield", aldus Schuur.
<p>
In '90 kwam Domela opnieuw naar het dorp, nu om de arbeiders
moed in te spreken bij een grote staking, die zou uitlopen op
een drie weken durende uitputtingsslag, die de arbeiders
verloren en tot grote verbittering leidde. In '93 was er een
hongeroproer. Drie voormannen werden, toen ze ingingen op de
uitnodiging voor een gesprek met de burgemeester, onverhoeds
in de boeien geslagen, waarna een soort staat van beleg werd
afgekondigd. De drie werden tot een jaar gevangenisstraf
veroordeeld in het `hongerproces' van Heerenveen, waar Pieter
Jelles Troelstra als hun advocaat optrad. Hun gezinnen bleven
in de diepste armoede achter. "Ik aarzel niet als mijn oordeel
uit te spreken dat hier niet het recht had gezegevierd maar de
klassejustitie", merkt Schuur op.
<p>
Schuur schetst een wrang beeld van de houding van de gemeente-
raad, de Nederlandse hervormde Kerk en zelfs de SDAP. De
lokale elite, de veenbazen dus, maakte de dienst uit bij de
NH-kerk. Zelfs tijdens de zwartste crisisjaren hield de armoe-
dekas van de diakonie geld over. "Beschamend", stelt Schuur.
Geen wonder dat de kerk nagenoeg al haar leden verloor.
De gemeente deed het niet veel beter. Ook zij gaf mondjesmaat,
en socialisten en stakers kregen bij voorkeur zeer weinig of
zelfs niks. Schuur bekritiseert de SDAP om haar halfslachtige
houding in de jaren twintig en dertig. De partij, die zitting
neemt in Kamer, Staten en gemeenteraad, slaagt er niet in
onverdacht afstand te houden van de gevestigde orde. Veel
sympathie verspeelt ze in 1925 en 1932 wegens haar onduidelij-
ke opstelling tegenover wilde stakingsacties tegen de werkver-
schaffing.
<p>
Schuur plaatst de lokale ontwikkelingen tegen de achtergrond
van de algemene politieke en sociaal-economische toestand.
Dankzij zijn menselijk bronnenmateriaal kan hij hier en daar
een onthulling doen. Zo weet hij nu wie in 1925 uit protest de
schuur van een rijke boer in brand stak en kent hij de daders
van sabotagedaden in 1936. De politie is daar nooit achter
gekomen. Namen noemt Schuur niet... omdat de daders nog in
leven zijn.
<p>
In het laatste hoofdstuk wijdt hij aandacht aan het rijke
anarchistische verenigingsleven in het dorp, dat tot doel had
het volk geestelijk te verheffen. Vooral hieraan ontleent het
anarchisme zijn betekenis in Appelscha, meent Schuur, en hij
noemt het bijzonder jammer dat juist dit aspect altijd zo
onderbelicht blijft. Het is een wat merkwaardige opmerking
voor iemand die slechts acht pagina's aan dit verenigingsleven
wijdt in een boek van 300 overigens boeiende (en ge#llustreer-
de bladzijden.

<H2>A Career in Law At McMillan Binch:</NOBR><BR><NOBR>
Articling and Summer Student Programs</NOBR></H2>

<P>McMillan Binch is committed to its student programs as its primary source of new
lawyers. Law students with superior academic credentials and well-rounded backgrounds
come to the firm to receive excellent experience and training in an atmosphere of
collegiality, creativity and independence.</P><BR>

<H2><IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BlBul2.gif">Articling Student Program</H2>

<P>Articling students are integrated as quickly as possible, through our rotation program,
into all aspects of the firm's practice.  Students work for three months in each of
three rotations, which in combination represent all of the firm's practice areas, and
spend the remaining time in a practice area of particular interest to them.  </P>

<P>Articling students receive assignments directly from the lawyers in their rotations. 
They are expected to manage their own workload and to meet their own time requirements
on the same basis as any of the firm's lawyers.  </P>

<P>Every articling student has her or his own computer equipped with standard software and
access to on-line research databases.  Also, every articling student is assigned a
mentor and takes part in the firm's articling student seminar program.</P>

<P>The firm has participated in exchange programs with the Royal Bank of Canada, the
Advocacy Resource Centre for the Handicapped and the Ontario Securities Commission and
expects to continue this practice with future articling classes.</P><BR>

<H2><IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BlBul2.gif">Summer Student Program</H2>

<P>The firm's summer program provides students who have completed two years of law school
with an opportunity to experience the practice of law in a firm environment.</P>

<P>Summer students are each assigned to one of the firm's practice areas and, like
articling students, are involved in a practical way with a variety of legal
assignments.  They participate fully in the firm's educational and social activities.</P>

<P>The firm participates in the International Business and Trade Law Summer Program and
the Summer Fellowship Programs in Public Interest Advocacy offered by the University of
Toronto and Osgoode Hall Law School.  Under these programs, students spend
approximately half the summer at McMillan Binch and the other half seconded to either a
professor in the area of international business and trade or working for a public
interest group.</P>

<P>Qualified students interested in receiving more information about career opportunities
at McMillan Binch should write to <A HREF="mailto:fmahil@mcbinch.com">Frances Mahil</A>.</P>

<H1>Business<BR>Arrangements</H1>
<P>
Your business is important to us. We are committed to providing
you with the timely, high&#173;quality, cost&#173;effective legal
services that you need. By establishing these business arrangements,
we aim to ensure a long and mutually&#173;satisfying working relationship.
Unless otherwise agreed, these arrangements apply until they are
changed in consultation with you.  
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=4>Scope of Services</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<B>Your Needs and Our Role</B> 
<P>
You want to purchase only the legal services you need and to keep
your costs in line with those needs. Before beginning your work,
we discuss with you the nature, scope and potential cost of these
services and our role in providing them. For example, we may be
primarily responsible for an entire transaction, part of a team
with your personnel, or an advisor on a single issue. We discuss
with you changes in the scope of services if they are indicated.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Legal Research </B>
<P>
Before doing extensive legal research, we assess what is relevant
and appropriate in the circumstances and discuss it with you.
<BR>

<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=4>Team Service</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<B>Team Approach </B>
<P>
We are committed to a team approach and an environment that is
free from discrimination. We work with your personnel and any
consultant or third party services you hire.<BR>

<P>
<B>Primary Service Team</B>
<P>
We are committed to service and custom build a Primary Service
Team tailored to your needs. Your Primary Service Team, led by
an Engagement Partner, is a core group of professionals committed
to knowing and understanding your business and selected in consultation
with you for their experience and expertise. We absorb the cost
of familiarizing any newly&#173;assigned member of the team with
your business. When needed, we draw on our other professionals
to complement the Team.<BR>

<P>
<B>Other Consultants </B>
<P>
We ask for your approval before hiring other consultants or third
party service providers, other than for routine or incidental
services. We ordinarily ask those service providers to bill you
directly.<BR>

<P>
<B>Delegation and Quality Assurance </B>
<P>
We believe that appropriate delegation of work, with appropriate
supervision, translates into value for money. We avoid &quot;over&#173;lawyering&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Professional Development </B>
<P>
We value professional development for everyone at McMillan Binch.
It occurs for your benefit, 
<P>
not at your expense.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=4>Fees</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<B>Fees</B>
<P>
We will discuss our fees with you at any time.<BR>

<P>
<B>Standard Rate Arrangements</B>
<P>
Our fees are ordinarily based on the time spent, valued at the
standard rates of the professionals doing your work. These standard
rates vary and reflect the expertise and experience of each professional.
We periodically review and adjust our standard rates, and we advise
you of any changes affecting your work.<BR>

<P>
<B>Alternative Fee Arrangements</B>
<P>
You may find alternative fee arrangements attractive for some
or all of your work. For example, it is sometimes appropriate
to have different arrangements for different phases of a large
project. We encourage discussion of alternative fee arrangements
before starting your work. <BR>

<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=4>Disbursements</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<B>Disbursements</B>
<P>
Out&#173;of&#173;pocket expenses incurred on your behalf are charged
to you at our cost, as summarized in our Disbursement Policy.
<BR>

<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=4>Billing</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<B>Account Format</B>
<P>
When we provide our services on a standard rate arrangement, we
provide you with as much detail of the time spent on your work
as you request. If you have any account format requirements, please
tell us. <BR>

<P>
<B>Billing Frequency</B>
<P>
Ordinarily, each month, we issue one account that details the
fees and disbursements for all services provided during the previous
month. For project work, billing may occur more or less frequently
as agreed.<BR>

<P>
<B>Currency</B>
<P>
We bill in Canadian or US dollars, as you prefer.<BR>

<P>
<B>Goods and Services Tax</B>
<P>
Your account includes applicable Goods and Services Tax. Before
we issue an account to a 
<P>
non&#173;resident of Canada, we consider whether our services
may be zero&#173;rated.<BR>

<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=4>Payment</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<B>Advances</B>
<P>
We may ask for an advance against fees and disbursements which
we hold in trust and for which we fully account. The amount of
any advance requested depends on a number of factors which we
discuss with you.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Payment</B>
<P>
Our accounts are due on receipt. If you have any questions about
an account, we encourage you to ask them immediately so that we
may discuss them. If an account remains unpaid after discussions
with you, we reserve the right to charge interest as permitted
by the <I>Solicitors' Act</I> (Ontario) and to stop further work,
subject to the rules of professional conduct.<BR>

<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=4>General</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<B>Conflicts of Interest</B>
<P>
Before we begin your work, we ensure that we have no legal conflicts
of interest in accordance with the rules of our governing body,
the Law Society of Upper Canada. If in the course of your work
a legal conflict of interest arises, we discuss it with you immediately.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Professional Liability Insurance</B>
<P>
We carry insurance that exceeds the requirements of the Law Society
of Upper Canada. If you would like more information, please let
us know.<BR>

<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=4>Communication</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<B>Accessibility</B>
<P>
We pride ourselves on being accessible. A member of your Primary
Service Team is always available to you. Members of your Team
have their own direct telephone lines with voicemail and secretarial
backup. If you have E&#173;Mail capability, you may wish to link
up with our offices.<BR>

<P>
<B>Open and Direct Communication</B>
<P>
We place a high value on open and direct communication. We know
it is essential for a long&#173;term successful relationship.
If you have any questions about our Business Arrangements or our
service, speak with any member of your Primary Service Team, your
Engagement Partner, or either one of our managing partners, Patricia
Olasker (416 865&#173;7114) or Sarah Pepall (416 865&#173;7002).<BR>

<H2>A National and International Presence</H2>
<CENTER>

<H1>McMillan Bull Casgrain</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>In 1989, in order to meet client requirements in an 
increasingly competitive and global business environment, 
McMillan Binch joined with Bull, Housser & Tupper in Vancouver 
and Byers Casgrain in Montreal to form a national association 
and an international partnership under the name McMillan Bull 
Casgrain.  This Canadian-based international law partnership 
carries a professional complement of more than 300 lawyers.</P>

<P>The partnership assists foreign clients with investment and 
trade activities across Canada and works with Canadian clients 
pursuing international initiatives.  It routinely advises on 
international financial transactions involving Canadian and 
foreign markets.  The international partnership maintains a 
presence in the Pacific Region.</P>

<P>Each firm continues to practice law under its own name within 
Canada while providing access to the combined services of the 
association.  The national association operates in four 
domestic offices and provides enhanced levels of service to 
clients in Canada's three principal business centres:  Toronto, 
Vancouver and Montreal.  The expertise, areas of specialization 
and resources of each of the firms are coordinated through 
national practice groups.</P>

<H1>Public Policy/Public-Private Partnerships</H1>

<P>Our firm has a longstanding history of leadership on matters of government relations,
economics and public policy.  Our public policy lawyers routinely advise corporations,
associations and government on a wide variety of issues involving government/business
relations, and they have often taken the lead in initiating  legislative changes in key
areas such as tax, corporate law, competition law and regulation of foreign investment. 
Their expertise extends from pure privatization to the formation of partnerships between
national, provincial and local governments and the private sector to facilitate the
development, construction and implementation of projects which, due to their size,
complexity and risk, require private sector expertise and public sector financing and
support.</P>

to the most complex.  Our tax lawyers, always sensitive to business goals, provide advice
on corporate reorganizations, mergers and acquisitions, securities, structured financing
and derivative products, leasing and international cross-border transactions.  They
routinely advise clients on compliance matters and are experienced in negotiating disputes

<FONT SIZE=4><CENTER>        Canada Responds to U.S. &quot;Cuba&quot; Laws with
a Carrot and a Stick<BR>
<BR></CENTER></FONT>
The Canada - U.S. dispute over trade with Cuba intensified
on January 1, 1997 when amendments to the <I>Foreign Extraterritorial
Measures Act</I> (&quot;FEMA&quot;) came into force.  The amendments
to FEMA expressly target <I>The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity
(Libertad) Act of 1996</I> (&quot;<I>Helms-Burton</I>&quot;).
The purpose of the amendments is to deter Canadian companies from
complying with <I>Helms-Burton</I>, while also providing relief
for Canadians who have been sued in the U.S. under that legislation.
<BR>
<BR>
<I>The Stick<BR>
<BR>
</I>The maximum fines that Canadian businesses face if they violate
the <I>Foreign Extraterritorial Measures (United States) Order,
1992, </I>as amended<I> </I>(the &quot;Order&quot;), have been
significantly increased by the amendments.  The Order prohibits
Canadian businesses from complying with U.S. anti-Cuba legislation
such as <I>Helms-Burton</I>.  For a more detailed discussion of
the Order, please refer to McMillan Binch's Website and the article
entitled: &quot;<I>Canadian and U.S. &gt;Cuba' Laws: The Risks
of Getting Caught in the Crossfire</I>&quot;(March 13, 1996).
 The increased Canadian fines are now more in line with the fines
faced by those convicted under U.S. anti-Cuba laws.  The clear
objective is to ensure that companies operating in Canada pay
as much attention to FEMA as to the U.S. legislation. <BR>
<BR>
The maximum fines now faced by Canadians who violate the Order
are:<BR>

<P>
The amendments to FEMA set out criteria for Canadian courts to
consider in sentencing.  They include the degree of premeditation
in the commission of the offence, the size, scale and nature of
the offender's operations and whether any economic benefits have,
directly or indirectly, accrued to the offender as a result of
having committed the offence.<BR>
<BR>
<I>The Carrot<BR>
<BR>
</I>The amendments to FEMA offer Canadians the following types
of relief if they are sued under <I>Helms-Burton</I>:<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI><I>Helms-Burton Judgments Not Enforceable in Canada C</I>
FEMA now expressly prohibits the recognition and enforcement in
any manner in Canada of any judgment given under <I>Helms-Burton</I>.
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><I>Recovery of Expenses Before Final Judgment C</I> The Attorney
General of Canada is authorized to maintain a schedule of foreign
trade laws which in his opinion are contrary to international
law or international comity. Currently, all of the provisions
<I>Helms-Burton</I> are on the schedule. Where proceedings are
instituted under a foreign trade law listed in the schedule, and
no final judgment has been given under those proceedings, a Canadian
party may, with the consent of the Attorney General, at any time
during the proceedings sue the person who instituted the action
and recover all expenses incurred by the party in defending those
proceedings and in instituting proceedings under FEMA, including
legal and other costs.
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><I>&quot;Clawback Rights&quot; C</I> A Canadian against whom
a final judgment under <I>Helms-Burton</I> has been rendered may
apply to the Attorney-General for an order declaring that that
party may recover from the person in whose favour the <I>Helms-Burton</I>
judgment was given (the &quot;foreign party&quot;), any or all
amounts obtained under the judgment, expenses incurred, or loss
or damages suffered. Once such an order is issued, the Canadian
party may sue the foreign party in Canada. To enforce the clawback
right, in addition to any other available means of enforcement,
a Canadian court is authorized to order the seizure and sale of
the property of the foreign party (or any person who controls,
or is a member of a group of persons that controls, the foreign
party). Such property includes shares of any corporation incorporated
by or under a law of Canada or a province, regardless of where
the share certificates are located.<BR>
</UL>
<P>
<I>The Future<BR>
<BR>
</I>The amendments to FEMA send a message to Canadian companies
that business with Cuba must go on as usual.  The relief mechanisms
provide a carrot for maintaining business relations with Cuba.
 If the carrot fails to entice, the government's stick has also
gotten a lot bigger.<BR>

1.      What is the relevant legislation and who enforces it?
<BR>
<BR>
The Competition Act, a federal statute, governs all aspects of
Canadian competition law, and provides one stop shopping for the
review and control of mergers.<BR>
<BR>
The Director of Investigation and Research (the &quot;Director&quot;)
has exclusive authority to investigate and restrain mergers. 
The Director alone can move to block a merger by seeking an order
of the Competition Tribunal, Canada's first level adjudicator
respecting mergers having competitive implications in relevant
markets.  A reference to the Competition Tribunal occurs only
if, after Competition Bureau staff conduct a thorough investigation
and attempt to resolve any competition law concerns with the parties,
the Director concludes that the merger is likely to prevent or
lessen competition substantially in Canada.<BR>
<BR>
2.      Is filing mandatory or voluntary?<BR>
<BR>
Pre-notification is not required in all cases:  The statutory
requirement to pre-notify applies only to what may be described
as larger transactions where the transaction size and the size
of the parties involved exceed certain thresholds.<BR>
<BR>
Even if the statutory thresholds are not exceeded, thus imposing
no positive obligation on the parties to pre-notify, the parties
to a transaction that may have a significant anti-competitive
impact typically notify the Director informally about the transaction.
 In respect of such transactions, the parties should prepare and
file information similar to that which would be provided if pre-notification
were required.  Failing this, the Director may, at worst, seek
injunctive relief to oppose the transaction, or, at best, conduct
an investigation and make information requests which can delay
completion of the transaction.<BR>
<BR>
3.      What kind of transactions are caught?<BR>
<BR>
Subject to certain exemptions, pre-notification is required for
four types of transactions, namely: share acquisitions, asset
acquisitions, amalgamations and unincorporated combinations.<BR>
<BR>
4.      What are the jurisdictional thresholds?<BR>
<BR>
Share and asset acquisitions and combinations are notifiable if
they involve acquisition of assets or a company having assets
valued in excess of CDN$35 million, or gross revenues from sales
in or from Canada exceeding CDN$35 million.  To be mandatorily
notifiable a share acquisition must also involve acquisition of
a minimum percentage of voting shares (generally, 20% in the case
of a public company and 35% in the case of a privately-held company).
 Amalgamations are pre-notifiable if the aggregate value of assets
in Canada of the continuing corporation, or the gross revenues
from sales in or from Canada generated by those assets, exceeds
CDN$70 million.<BR>
<BR>
If a transaction is of a type described above, a pre-notification
is required unless it also fits within one of the statutory exemptions.
 While there are a good many of these, two may be considered basic
and should operate to exempt a wide variety of deals:<BR>
<BR>
(a)     if the parties (together with their affiliates) have assets
in Canada or gross revenues from sales in, from or into Canada
of less than CDN$400 million in aggregate, then pre-notification
is not required.<BR>
(b)     a similar exemption exists if the transaction does not
involve an operating business (a term defined in the Competition
Act to mean a business undertaking in Canada to which employees
employed in connection with the undertaking ordinarily report).
<BR>
<BR>
5.      Are foreign-to-foreign mergers caught?<BR>
<BR>
The Canadian interests giving rise to an obligation to pre-notify
may be held directly by a non-Canadian-based corporation, or indirectly
through its control of a Canadian or other subsidiary or subsidiaries.
 Accordingly, transactions which occur entirely outside of Canada
will be notifiable if the relevant Canadian businesses meet the
statutory thresholds.<BR>
<BR>
6.      What are the sanctions for not filing?<BR>
<BR>
A positive obligation to file rests on each party proposing the
transaction, and  those who fail to notify when so obliged run
the risk of criminal charges.  A person convicted of failing to
comply with the pre-notification provisions of the Competition
Act is liable to a fine not exceeding CDN$5,000 or to imprisonment
for up to two years, or both.  Any director of a corporation who
acquiesces or participates in the commission of such offense by
the corporation is subject to the same liability.  In addition,
the Director may seek injunctive relief to prevent a transaction
from closing, or in the case of a competitively significant transaction,
other remedial measures, including dissolution of the merger,
if the transaction has been completed.<BR>
<BR>
7.      What are the filing deadlines?<BR>
<BR>
Pre-notification filings may be made at any time, but must be
made in sufficient time for the statutory waiting periods to expire
before closing the transaction (the waiting periods are discussed
more fully below).  A party may file prior to the announcement
date of a notifiable transaction provided all the information
required to complete the filing is available. <BR>
<BR>
8.      Who is responsible for filing?<BR>
<BR>
The Competition Act imposes filing obligations on the &quot;person
or persons who are proposing the transaction&quot;.  Except in
unusual circumstances, the parties to the transaction will be
considered to be the persons proposing it, and thus will have
an obligation to file.  Counsel for each party typically prepares
a filing on behalf of its own client, and files it separately,
although simultaneously, with the Competition Bureau.<BR>
<BR>
9.      What is the timetable for clearance and can it be speeded
up?<BR>
<BR>
There is no mechanism under the Competition Act to shorten the
waiting periods, although amendments proposed to be made to the
Competition Act would permit the Director to waive or abridge
the waiting periods.<BR>
<BR>
10.     Are there waiting periods and does implementation of the
transaction have to be suspended?<BR>
<BR>
The Competition Act contemplates notification being made in short
form or long form, at the election of the filing party, and provides
for two alternative very short waiting periods following notification.
 A notifiable transaction cannot close until the relevant statutory
waiting period has expired.  <BR>
<BR>
If a short form of notice is used, the transaction may be completed
on the eighth day after the completed filing has been received
by the Director, unless the Director exercises his discretion
to require a long form notice or obtains an order preventing completion
of the transaction.  If a long form of notice is used, the transaction
may be completed on the twenty-second day after the completed
filing has been received by the Director unless the Director has
obtained an order preventing completion of the transaction.  
<BR>
<BR>
In practice, the waiting periods have proven to provide too short
a time frame for the Director adequately to review larger and
more complex transactions.  Possible amendments to the Competition
Act currently under discussion by the Director include extending
the waiting periods to fourteen and forty-two days, respectively.
<BR>
<BR>
11.     What are the issues involved in closing before clearance?
<BR>
<BR>
After expiry of the statutory waiting periods, the parties may
complete the transaction.  But, transactions which have the appearance
of competitive significance, whether pre-notifiable or not, will
be closely reviewed by the Director, and the Director has the
ability under the Competition Act to seek an injunction to prohibit
any such transaction.  Inevitably this has meant the voluntary
extension of time periods in transactions of competitive significance.
<BR>
<BR>
When the Director makes it known to the parties that he cannot
complete his investigation prior to the expiry of the waiting
periods or prior to a scheduled closing date, the parties customarily
will undertake to the Director in writing not to complete the
transaction until his investigation is completed, or for a reasonable
period to allow for investigation, or not to close except on prior
notice to the Director.  The undertaking essentially puts the
Director in the same position he would have been in had he moved
for an interim order before the Competition Tribunal without subjecting
the parties and the Director to the hostility and cost of litigation.
 The parties may also be expected to undertake to operate on an
arm's length and business as usual basis and to not change their
business activities in contemplation of the transaction.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hold-separate&quot; arrangements may also be agreed in limited
circumstances, but hold-separate commitments are not a common
feature of Canadian merger practice.<BR>
<BR>
12.     What is involved in the preparation of a filing?<BR>
<BR>
The filing requirements are prescribed under the Corporation Act,
and the length of any particular filing will depend on the nature
and size of the parties' Canadian operations.  Typically, the
information required to complete a filing can be set out in 10-15
pages plus securities filings and draft legal documents which
will constitute the bulk of the filing.  Filings may be made in
either the French or English language.<BR>
<BR>
In the case of a short form filing, the transaction must be described
together with business objectives which are hoped to be achieved.
 In addition, the parties, together with certain of their affiliates,
must be identified and their respective businesses and lines of
business described and quantified.  This description must include
a list of current principal suppliers and customers and a statement
of annual purchases therefrom and sales thereto, respectively.
 Pro forma financial statements, other financial information and
copies of securities filings, if any (whether in Canada or elsewhere),
for a two-year preceding period are required to be submitted.
 Finally, copies of all relevant legal documents (including most
recent drafts) that are to be used to implement the transaction
must accompany the filing.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the information which is required to be provided
in a short form filing, a long form filing must also include a
description of the business and lines of business (together with
supplier and customer information) of certain wholly-owned and
wholly-owned affiliates of the parties and a description (including
a statement of sales) of the principal categories of the products
of the business and a principal category of products purchased
by the parties and their affiliates.  Where the parties, directly
or indirectly, own more than 20% of the voting shares of any Canadian
operating business, disclosure of such holdings must be made.
 In addition, copies of all reports and data prepared to assist
the parties' directors and senior officers in analysing the transaction
must accompany the filing.  Finally, if any decision, commitment
or undertaking has been made by any of the parties in respect
of significant changes in any business to which a proposed transaction
relates, a summary description of the same must be disclosed.
<BR>
Provision in made in the forms for the parties to supply additional
analytical information to assist the Director in his review of
the proposed transaction.  The circumstances of each transaction
will dictate whether additional information should be supplied
and when such information should be filed.  In practice, the parties
have a variety of options ranging from a short summary analysis
of the transaction to a detailed &quot;white paper&quot; or a
competitive impact analysis.  In a transaction of competitive
significance the parties will inevitably be requested to provide
more information than that required in a short or long form filing.
 The parties to such transactions will likely find it useful to
provide the Director, in advance, with the documents and other
evidence he is bound to seek in the course of his assessment.
<BR>
<BR>
In order to mitigate the filing burdens, a number of provisions
have been introduced which limit a parties' obligation to submit
information.  For example, a filing party is not required to supply
information that is not known or reasonably obtainable or without
breaching a confidentiality requirement.  An exemption is also
provided where to comply would require the filing party to provide
information that could not reasonably be considered to be relevant
to an assessment by the Director of the transaction's competitive
impact.<BR>
<BR>
A statement must be given under oath if information is not being
supplied for reasons of confidentiality, lack of knowledge or
irrelevance.  The statement must include the reasons for not providing
the information.  The contents of the filing must also be certified
on oath or affirmation as having been examined by the person providing
the certificate and as being, to the best of his knowledge and
belief, correct and complete in all material respects.<BR>
<BR>
13.     What are the basic procedures after filing?<BR>
<BR>
The investigative process involves an ongoing dialogue and negotiations
between Competition Bureau staff and the merger parties, even
following the staff's initial recommendation to the Director.
 An investigation may be include document requests from the parties
(there is some movement to requests on the scale of US document
demands) and information requests from third parties.  The Director's
current policy is to require that responses to requests for information
(from the merger parties and complainants) be provided under oath
or affirmation.<BR>
<BR>
14.     What is the substantive test for clearance?<BR>
<BR>
The basic test, to be applied by both the Director and the Competition
Tribunal, is whether the merger is likely to prevent or lessen
the competition substantially in relevant geographic and product
markets.  This test applies to all mergers (a defined term which
covers essentially any acquisition of control over or a significant
interest in the whole or part of a business of another person),
whether or not the transaction is notifiable.<BR>
<BR>
Canadian competition authorities take a functional and analytic
approach to what may constitute a substantial prevention or lessening
of competition.  In 1991, the Director issued Merger Enforcement
Guidelines (&quot;Guidelines&quot;) which provide a detailed outline
of the Competition Bureau's approach to analysis and enforcement
of the merger laws.  Although reliable generally, the Guidelines
are not a binding statement of policy, and they do not have the
force of law.<BR>
<BR>
The Director takes the position that a prevention or lessening
of competition can only result from a merger where the parties
are or would likely be able to exercise a greater degree of market
power, unilaterally or interdependently with others, after completion
of the merger than if the merger did not proceed.  In considering
this question, the Director looks principally at whether the merged
entity would profitably be able to influence prices through unilateral
action, or as a result of increased opportunity for interdependent
behaviour (which extends beyond conscious parallelism to collusion).
<BR>
<BR>
The Competition Act expressly provides that the Competition Tribunal
(and thus the Director) may not find a merger or a proposed merger
prevents or lessens competition substantially solely on the basis
of concentration of market share.  The Guidelines make it clear
that concentration is a necessary but not sufficient condition
for finding a substantial lessening of competition.  There are
two so-called &quot;safe harbours&quot; in the Guidelines.  The
first provides that, absent any concern about coordinated behaviour,
if the post-merger market share of the merged entity is less than
35%, it is presumed not to be able unilaterally to exercise greater
market power and the merger normally will not be challenged. 
The second safe harbour applies where anti-competitive effects
are thought likely because of interdependent behaviour.  In such
circumstances, the Guidelines provide that a merger is not likely
to warrant a detailed review where the post-merger market share
of the merged entity is less than 10%, or where the post-merger
market share of the four largest firms in the market is less than
65%.  As market shares rise beyond the safe harbours, the likelihood
of the Director developing a concern will rise.<BR>
<BR>
Structural and behavioural characteristics of relevant antitrust
markets are important, and the Competition Act suggests that the
Competition Tribunal (and thus the Director) have regard to a
series of factors, each of which is discussed fully in the Guidelines.
 These include:<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>effective competition from foreign products or foreign competitors;
<LI>whether the business, or part of the business, of a party
to the merger or a proposed merger has failed or is likely to
fail;
<LI>the availability of substitute products;
<LI>entry barriers into the market;
<LI>the extent to which effective competition remains;
<LI>any likelihood that the merger or a proposed merger would
or would result in the removal of a vigorous and effective competitor;
<LI>the nature and extent of change of innovation in relevant
markets; and
<LI>any other factor that is relevant to competition in an affected
market.<BR>
</UL>
<P>
Three factors, ease of entry, business failure and effective remaining
competition, have become trump cards in that any in and of itself
may be accepted by the Director as sufficient to demonstrate that
a merger will not prevent or lessen the competition substantially.
<BR>
<BR>
The Competition Act provides a number of exemptions from coverage.
 These include where the Director has issued an advance ruling
certificate in respect of the merger; certain bank amalgamations;
joint ventures for special projects; and a statutory efficiency
defence.<BR>
<BR>
15.     To what extent are non-competition issues relevant to
the review process?<BR>
<BR>
While the Director is appointed by and serves at the pleasure
of the federal Cabinet, his duties are statutory.  The Director
traditionally has exercised an independent mandate to protect
the public interest in a competitive market place, and is not
influenced by broader public policy concerns such as reductions
in employment that might result from the merger.<BR>
<BR>
16.     Are the authorities influenced by the decision of other
authorities?<BR>
<BR>
Transactions that cross borders are a common place in Canada,
and many mergers will have similar impacts in Canada and the United
States.  While the Director will make his own determination of
the likely impact of a merger in Canada (and may take remedial
action against transactions which are approved in other jurisdictions),
he will be influenced by decisions taken by other antitrust enforcement
agencies, particularly in the United States.  It should be expected
that enforcement agencies will share their views on the possible
effects of a transaction and positions taken by the parties. 
It is therefore important to ensure that counsel in the various
jurisdictions in which submissions are made coordinate their thinking
to ensure that a position is not taken in one jurisdiction which
might prejudice a position taken in another.<BR>
<BR>
17.     Is it possible to remedy competition issues?<BR>
<BR>
If, as a result of her examination, the Director comes to the
view that a proposed merger is likely to prevent or lessen the
competition substantially, he will inform the parties of his initial
conclusions and the reasons for them.  The purpose behind this
approach is to provide the parties with an opportunity to see
whether the transaction can re-structured so as to overcome his
concerns.<BR>
<BR>
Pre-closing restructurings will be investigated by the Director's
staff to determine whether they adequately address the concerns
identified.  If such a solution presents itself, and the parties
are prepared to accept such a change in their deal, this is usually
the end of the matter.  Because the restructuring will have taken
place prior to closing, the Director's concerns will have been
answered and there will be no basis upon which the transaction
can properly be made the subject of a Competition Tribunal application.
 The reality is that many commercial deals simply cannot be held
together for the length of time which is usually necessary to
complete a divestiture of a division, or something similar so
as to effect a fix-it first solution.<BR>
<BR>
18.     What rights do complainants have?<BR>
<BR>
There is no right in a private party to attack a merger, whether
before the Competition Tribunal or the regular courts, which the
Director does not choose to contest.  This is so no matter how
adversely affected by the merger such a party may be.  However,
if the Director brings an application to the Competition Tribunal
with respect to the merger, parties affected by the merger may
intervene and make submissions.  In addition, those who believe
themselves to be detrimentally affected by a merger may complain
to the Director with a view to having him look into the transaction.
 Information provided by a complainant will be investigated and
verified by Competition Bureau staff, and complainants will be
requested to provide that information under oath or affirmation.
<BR>
<BR>
19.     What publicity is given to the process?<BR>
<BR>
The Competition Act requires that investigations be conducted
in private.  Persons involved in the administration or enforcement
of the Act are prohibited, with limited exceptions, from disclosing
information required by the Act to be provided in support of a
pre-notifiable transaction, or the fact that a pre-notification
or other information was provided in respect of a pre-notifiable
transaction.  These types of information may only be disclosed
(a) if the information is otherwise made public; (b) to a &quot;Canadian
law enforcement law agency&quot;; or (c) &quot;for the purposes
of the administration or enforcement of the Act.<BR>
<BR>
20.     What are the enforcement powers?<BR>
<BR>
Where the Director elects to refer a merger to the Competition
Tribunal, the Competition Tribunal Act provides for a straight
forward process of complaint, answer, discovery, hearing and decision.
 The procedure is open and public, although orders for in camera
proceedings may be made.  Where it is found if the merger will
lessen competition substantially, the Tribunal may (a) prohibit
a not-yet consummated merger; (b) order dissolution or divestiture;
(c) grant conditional approval; and/or (d) prohibit certain future
acquisitions.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
21.     What is the role of ministerial or other government involvement?
<BR>
<BR>
The Competition Bureau operates as a virtually independent agency
within the federal Department of Industry.  As indicated above,
the Director has considerable sensitivity about attempts to influence
exercise of his discretion.  Over time, a corresponding sensitivity
has developed in the government.<BR>
<BR>
This is not to suggest that the Director's office is off-limits
to other federal officials or to politicians.  Indeed, those who
have to steer a merger through the Director's examination will
often find close allies and important evidence in other government
departments.  However, in marshalling support of this nature,
it is important to ensure that it is offered in the context of
the factors which the Director may properly consider in assessing
a proposed merger.<BR>
<BR>
22.     What are the opportunities for judicial review?<BR>
<BR>
If the Director elects to oppose a merger, his sole recourse is
to apply to the Competition Tribunal for an order.  A decision
or order of the Competition Tribunal may be appealed to the Federal
Court of Appeal, whether final, interlocutory or interim in nature.
 There is no provision for the override of Competition Tribunal
decisions or orders by the federal Cabinet or any other political
body or agency.<BR>
<BR>
23.     Are there also rules on foreign investment, special sectors
or relevant approvals?<BR>
<BR>
A non-Canadian seeking to establish or acquire control of a Canadian
business may find its proposed transaction requires some other
approval, including notification or in some cases review by the
federal Minister of Industry under the Investment Canada Act.
 The review thresholds are based on the gross assets of the business
to be acquired: CDN$5 million for direct acquisitions, and CDN$50
million for an indirect acquisition.  Transactions subject of
review are reviewed under a &quot;net benefits to Canada&quot;
test.  <BR>
As a result of amendments to the Investment Canada Act implementing
GATT agreements to establish the World Trade Organization, higher
thresholds for review apply to acquisitions by so-called WTO investors
(nationals or permanent residents of World Trade Organization
countries) and to acquisitions of companies controlled by WTO
investors.  Indirect acquisitions by WTO investors are not subject
to review (although must still be notified), and the review threshold
for direct acquisitions is CDN$160 million (in constant 1994 dollars,
adjusted annually).<BR>
<BR>
In addition, mergers in several regulated industries may be subject
to notification and review under industry-specific legislation.
 Examples include mergers involving broadcast undertakings, life
insurance companies, loan companies and banks.<BR>
<BR>
UPDATE AND TRENDS<BR>
<BR>
(a)     Cases   <BR>
The relatively recent enactment of the merger provisions (in 1986)
and the compliance oriented enforcement approach of the Director
have resulted in there being, as yet, only three contested merger
applications decided by the Competition Tribunal, one of which
related to the amendment of a consent order.  A fourth contested
merger is currently ongoing.  Those cases plus three others which
proceeded on the basis of a consent order comprise the entire
body of merger case law.<BR>
<BR>
In the two contested merger cases considered to date by the Competition
Tribunal, the Competition Tribunal focused on real-world behaviour
of consumers and competitors rather than theoretical or statistical
economic evidence to analyse the subject mergers and determine
their competitive effects.  The Competition Tribunal's approach
in both cases was sensible and pragmatic, although somewhat vague.
 Notwithstanding that the Competition Tribunal's interpretation
of the merger provisions is basically consistent with, although
somewhat less formal than, the approach of the Director in his
Guidelines, in neither case did the Competition Tribunal specifically
endorse the Guidelines approach to merger analysis, and in one
case it did not even mention the Guidelines.<BR>
<BR>
The Federal Court of Appeal for the first time recently considered
the product market dimensions of assessing competitive effects
of a merger.   The Court conducted a wide ranging review of Canadian
and US antitrust authorities on approaches to product market definition
before concluding that the Competition Tribunal had taken too
narrow an approach in its original decision.  Without accepting
any particular paradigm, the Court concluded that the Competition
Tribunal had given inadequate attention to indirect evidence of
broad &quot;inter-industry competition&quot;, and had erred by
requiring statistical or anecdotal evidence of high price sensitivity.
 The decision is currently on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
<BR>
<BR>
(b)     Legislative Amendments<BR>
<BR>
In June 1995, the Director initiated discussions regarding possible
amendments to the Competition Act.  The federal minister responsible
recently announced the government's intention to proceed with
some of the proposed amendments, including amendments to the merger
pre-notification scheme.  In addition to doubling the waiting
periods (described above), a number of technical amendments will
be made and new exemptions introduced.  Amendments to the substantive
merger provisions of the Competition Act are not contemplated.
 <BR>
<BR>
(c)     Filing Fees<BR>
<BR>
Canada does not currently impose user or filing fees.  In 1993,
the Director proposed that a fee in the range of CDN$12,000 -
15,000 be levied in connection with any pre-notification filing.
 He has since indicated that when his proposal is implemented
(possibly later this year) the fees will be higher than initially
proposed.<BR>

<P>
Many business lawyers who deal with private companies assume that
the prospectus and registration exemptions under the<I> Securities
Act</I> (Ontario) for securities of private companies are generally
available to private companies. However, this is not always the
case. A company which has private company<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>
restrictions in its articles (restrictions on share transfer and
the number of shareholders - not more than 50 exclusive of employees
and former employees, and a prohibition on offering securities
to the public)<SUP><FONT SIZE=2> <A HREF="#2">2</A></FONT></SUP> may find itself
in the position when it is in fact offering its securities to
the public in a number of common situations. For example, a small
number of sophisticated investors with no prior relationship to
the company may be interested in investing in it. Or the company
may be prepared to offer securities as an incentive to a large
number of employees. In each of these cases the recipients of
the securities may be members of the public for purposes of securities
regulation.<BR>
<P>
Case law has interpreted the concept of the &quot;public&quot;
broadly. Two tests have been articulated. The first is the &quot;common
bonds of association&quot; test which requires an investor who
is not a member of the public to have a common bond of interest
or association with the issuer of securities<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A HREF="#3">3</A></FONT></SUP>
(and not just a relationship with other investors in the securities)<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>
<A HREF="#4">4</A></FONT></SUP>. The second test, established in American case
law, identifies members of the public on the basis of whether
they &quot;need to know&quot; the type of information about the
issuer which a prospectus would provide.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2> <A HREF="#5">5</A></FONT></SUP>
At least one Ontario Securities Commission decision has required
both tests to be met before it is established that investors are
not members of the public.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2> <A HREF="#6">6</A><BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
As a result of this broad definition of who constitutes the public,
questions can often arise over the availability of securities
exemptions when a private company proposes to issue securities.
For example, a private company which requires financing may approach
a venture capital investor or investors either directly or through
an agent. These investors may not &quot;need to know&quot; because
they will do their own due diligence. However, especially if they
have been found through an agent, they will be unlikely to have
common bonds of association with the private company. As a result
the company may be offering its securities to the public.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>
<A HREF="#7">7</A></FONT></SUP> Fortunately, the private placement exemptions<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A HREF="#8">8</A>
</FONT></SUP>from the prospectus and registration requirements
of the <I>Securities Act</I> are available where the investors
purchase at least $150,000 of securities<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A HREF="#9">9</A></FONT></SUP>.
However, it will be necessary to amend the company's articles
to remove the private company restrictions (this requirement will
be highlighted if the company's counsel is asked to opine that
the transaction will not result in a breach of the company's articles).
It will also be necessary for the company to file a Form 20 with
the Ontario Securities Commission reporting on the trade and pay
a fee. In addition, the securities of the former private company
will become caught in the closed system and be subject to resale
restrictions.<BR>
<P>
If the proposals recommended by the Task Force on Small Business
Financing are implemented, other exemptions would be available<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A HREF="#10">10</A>
</FONT></SUP>to permit investment by accredited inventors or in
securities of closely-held business issuers.<BR>
<P>
In some instances even a company's employees may constitute the
public. Especially where the company has a considerable number
of employees, some employees will neither have the common bonds
with their employers nor will they have the familiarity with their
employer which would address their &quot;need to know&quot;. However,
prospectus and registration exemptions are available for trades
by an issuer to its employees or employees of an affiliate.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>
<A HREF="#11">11</A></FONT></SUP> Again, it will be necessary to remove the private
company restrictions from the company's articles, certain reporting
obligations arise and the securities of the former private company
become caught in the closed system and subject to resale restrictions.
<BR>
<P>
Advisors to private companies should be aware of who may be members
of the public when the company proposes to issue securities and
assess whether the private company restrictions should be removed
from the company's articles.<BR>

<P>
I. INTRODUCTION<!--I.  INTRODUCTION-->
<P>
Forum shopping has been a favourite past time of litigators for
centuries, probably for as long as there have been forums.<SUP><A HREF="#2">2</A></SUP>
Current trends such as the increased globalization of trade and
manufacturing, as well as greater ease of communication and travel
have given the issue increased importance in recent years and
are likely to continue to do so.
<P>
In recent years the legal tests surrounding forum shopping in
Anglo-Canadian law have undergone numerous reformulations. This
paper argues that the reformulations have been required because
courts are applying rules developed for another age and are applying
them in a mechanistic fashion without regard to the policies which
the courts really mean to advance. A review of the recent Canadian
and English cases suggests that the real goal of most courts in
forum shopping cases is to help the parties achieve their reasonable
expectations. This is rarely enunciated by courts who appear to
feel bound to fit their square cases into round precedents. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
Conflicts between jurisdictions seem to arise where one court
ignores the reasonable expectations of the parties and applies
its jurisdictional rules without reference to the purpose behind
them. The express recognition of the reasonable expectations of
the parties as a guiding factor in forum shopping cases would
significantly decrease the possibility of conflicts between forums,
decrease the amount of time and energy associated with forum shopping
and make it significantly easier for practitioners to predict
accurately which is the appropriate forum in which to argue a
case.<BR>
<P>
This paper will first examine what forum shopping is and what
factors promote it. Second, it will review the recent reformulations
of the law concerning <I>forum non conveniens. </I>Since the principle
of <I>forum non conveniens</I> lies at the root of all forum shopping
cases, the bulk of the paper will be devoted to the review of
these principles. For ease of reference, the concept of the appropriate
forum will be referred to as <I>forum non conveniens</I> even
though some jurisdictions may not apply the doctrine by that name.
Third, the paper will examine the concept of reasonable expectations
for the purpose of determining whether it ought to form a basis
of choosing between different forums. Finally, the paper will
examine how the incorporation of reasonable expectations in the
principles of <I>forum non conveniens</I> will affect the law
concerning anti-suit injunctions and negative declarations. <BR>
<P>
II. WHAT IS IT AND WHY IS IT?<BR>
<P>
Most simply defined, forum shopping is the act of choosing one
forum in which to litigate when a number of choices are possible.
A widely acceptable definition is difficult to arrive at because
courts rarely, if ever, discuss the policies or principles underlying
their decisions in forum shopping cases. They tend to condemn
a choice as <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>forum shopping<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT>
when they wish to express distaste for it and describe the choice
as appropriate when they agree with it.<SUP><A HREF="#3">3</A></SUP> The Supreme
Court of Canada has defined forum shopping as choosing a forum
to gain a juridical advantage rather than choosing a forum because
of its real and substantial connection to the case.<SUP><A HREF="#4">4</A></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
Plaintiffs are the most frequent forum shoppers by choosing where
to initiate their actions. Defendants, however, also have a number
of tools at their disposal which enable them to engage in forum
shopping. The most common of these are motions to set aside service
on the basis that the forum does not have jurisdiction, motions
to stay an action on the basis of <I>forum non</I> <I>conveniens</I>,
anti&#173;suit injunctions and negative declarations. <BR>
<P>
A motion to set aside service tends to be the least useful of
these tools. Most jurisdictions permit some sort of service <I>ex
juris</I>. Some permit service <I>ex juris</I> without leave of
the court, others require leave. Most jurisdictions also provide
a mechanism for setting aside service <I>ex juris</I> in appropriate
circumstances. Although the tests vary from one jurisdiction to
another, a motion to set aside service is usually determined as
a matter of law and not as a matter of discretion. That is to
say, the Court will determine whether service has been effected
in accordance with the rules which allow the forum to assume jurisdiction
over the defendant. Most such motions tend to fail because most
forums have liberal rules which allow for fairly broad assumption
of jurisdiction.<BR>
<P>
A motion to stay an action of the basis of <I>forum non conveniens
</I>or similar principles is, by way of contrast, one in which
the defendant may be prepared to acknowledge that the forum has
the legal ability to assume jurisdiction under its own rules but
invites the forum to exercise its discretion and decline to accept
jurisdiction because it is not the appropriate or natural forum
for the action.<BR>
<P>
An anti-suit injunction is a proceeding by an applicant in the
forum of his choice to enjoin a respondent from prosecuting an
action against him in a foreign jurisdiction. <BR>
<P>
Negative declarations are proceedings in which a party who is
a defendant in a foreign jurisdiction requests a Court in the
forum of his choice to declare that he has no liability arising
out of a certain set of circumstances.<BR>
<P>
Forum shopping exists for four principal reasons.<BR>
<P>
First and most obviously, different jurisdictions offer different
legal rules. In certain cases, the laws or procedures of one jurisdiction
offer one party a distinct advantage over another jurisdiction.
The following advantages have all been held to be legitimate reasons
for choosing one forum over another: cheaper and quicker trials,
provision of security for a claim, better pre-trial discovery,
higher damage awards, better interest awards, more favourable
limitation periods, remedies not available in another jurisdiction,
a lighter burden of proof, the availability of summary judgment
and more favourable substantive law provisions.<SUP><A HREF="#5">5</A> <BR>
</SUP>
<P>
The United States, for example, has long been a favoured destination
for plaintiff forum shoppers because the combination of class
actions, contingency fees, jury trials and doctrines of strict
liability for tort cases provide significant advantages.<SUP><A HREF="#6">6</A></SUP>
The incentive to seek out a favourable forum is strong even if
it will be applying a less favourable foreign law because of the
almost inescapable tendency to apply foreign law using local sensibilities.<SUP><A HREF="#7">7</A>
<BR>
</SUP>
<P>
Second, most forums have broadly based rules pursuant to which
they are entitled to assume jurisdiction. Where litigation arises
which has connections with a number of forums, each is likely
to have a rule which allows it to assume jurisdiction. For example,
most forums would assume jurisdiction over a defendant who resides
or carries on business within the forum. Most would also assume
jurisdiction with respect to damage sustained within the forum.<SUP><A HREF="#8">8</A></SUP>
Where the plaintiff and defendant reside in different forums,
both forums would be entitled to assume jurisdiction under these
two rules.<BR>
<P>
Third, conflict of law rules encourage forum shopping. It is well
accepted for example, that the substantive law of a tort is that
of the <I>lex loci delicti </I>but the procedural law is that
of the <I>lex fori</I>. A simple enough distinction if procedural
rules are limited to things such as the right to cross-examine.
Courts have, however, characterized as procedural, matters such
as limitation periods or limits on damages. Thus, a plaintiff
whose cause of action has expired in the jurisdiction in which
the tort occurred would be wise to bring the claim in a forum
which has a longer limitation period. In Canada, this practice
is likely to be less frequent in view of the Supreme Court<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
recent decision that limitation periods are to be considered substantive
rather than procedural.<SUP><A HREF="#9">9</A><BR>
</SUP>
<P>
Limits on damage awards may be found in statutory schemes such
as those which govern no fault automobile insurance regimes<SUP><A HREF="#10">10</A></SUP>
or Workers<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT> Compensation
schemes<SUP><A HREF="#11">11</A></SUP> or may arise from judicial pronouncements.<SUP><A HREF="#12">12</A></SUP>
In either case, the plaintiff has a strong interest in bringing
his claim in a jurisdiction which does not have limits on damages
and which will not apply the limits applicable in the <I>lex loci
delicti</I>. <BR>
<P>
These three factors are exacerbated by a fourth: the rules governing
lawyers<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT> professional
conduct. Most jurisdictions have rules of conduct which oblige
lawyers to advance every argument, however distasteful, which
the lawyer thinks will help the client<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
case and to endeavour to obtain for the client the benefit of
every remedy and defence authorized by law.<SUP><A HREF="#13">13</A></SUP> Where
a case has possible contacts with other forums, it may be part
of a lawyer<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s ethical
duty to explore the advantages of litigating in each. While a
solicitor may not expected to know what the laws or advantages
of other jurisdictions are, it may constitute professional negligence
not to address the issue.<SUP><A HREF="#14">14</A></SUP> The willingness of courts
to allow plaintiffs to choose between forums based on their relative
judicial advantages would appear to heighten a lawyer<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
duty to turn his or her mind to the issue.<BR>
<P>
III. EVOLUTION OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS <!--III.  EVOLUTION OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS -->
<BR>
<P>
To help them cope with the problems created by overlapping jurisdictional
rules, most jurisdictions have adopted some variation of the principle
of <I>forum non conveniens</I>. While the principle bears different
labels in different jurisdictions, the general goal is to try
an action in the forum with which it has the most real and substantial
connection. <BR>
<P>
To determine which is the appropriate forum in a given case, courts
have looked to a list of <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>connecting
factors<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> which have
included the following:<BR>
<P>
- juridical advantages available to the plaintiff
<P>
- juridical disadvantages to the defendant
<P>
- the location of each party<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
residence
<P>
- the location in which each party carries on business
<P>
- the forum in which the cause of action arose
<P>
- the forum in which loss or damage occurred
<P>
- the presence of parallel foreign proceedings<SUP><A HREF="#15">15</A></SUP>
<P>
- the location of key witnesses
<P>
- applicable law and its weight compared to factual questions
to be decided
<P>
- difficulties in proving foreign law<SUP><A HREF="#16">16</A></SUP> 
<P>
- in the case of parallel foreign proceedings, which action is
more comprehensive<SUP><A HREF="#17">17</A></SUP>
<P>
- the location of the defendant<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
assets<SUP><A HREF="#18">18</A><BR>
</SUP>
<P>
Unfortunately, the development of the <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>real
and substantial connection<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT>
test has been unsatisfactory. In most jurisdictions it has turned
into a lengthy checklist of factors which judges weigh and set
off against each other. Lord Templeman admitted as much in <I>Spiliada
Maritime Corporation v. Cansulex Ltd.</I><SUP><A HREF="#19">19</A></SUP> where he
stated that:<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>the factors which the
court is entitled to take into account in considering whether
one forum is more appropriate are legion. The authorities do not,
perhaps cannot, give any clear guidance as to how these factors
are to be weighed in any particular case.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In recent years the principle has undergone a series of transformations
all of which were required, it is submitted, because of a reluctance
to acknowledge openly the policy underlying the principle, which
is the enforcement of the reasonable expectations of the parties.
To test this thesis, it will first be necessary to review the
development of the law to determine what it was and what it has
become.
<P>
a) The Vexatious and Oppressive Test <!--a) The Vexatious and Oppressive Test -->
<BR>
<P>
Traditionally, Anglo-Canadian courts would only stay an action
on the basis of <I>forum non conveniens</I><SUP><A HREF="#20">20</A></SUP> if the
continuation of the action was oppressive or vexatious to the
defendant and provided the stay did not work an injustice to the
plaintiff.<SUP><A HREF="#21">21</A></SUP> In determining whether the continuation
of an action was oppressive or vexatious, courts looked to the
connecting factors described above and weighed them against each
other.<BR>
<P>
The vexatious and oppressive test gave substantial weight to any
juridical advantage which the plaintiff enjoyed in the forum of
his choice because it essentially provided that if a stay deprived
the plaintiff of a juridical advantage, the court would not stay
the action even if its continuation was vexatious and oppressive
to the defendant. <BR>
<P>
This test reflected several realities about the world from which
it emerged. First, the concentration on connecting factors reflected
a concern for the <U>convenience</U> of trying an action in a
particular forum. The test in some jurisdictions was, after all,
forum<I> non conveniens</I> This made sense in an era where travel
was difficult and communication slow. Second, it reflected the
notion of personal jurisdiction over a defendant which was especially
important in an era where a judgment obtained in one country was
of little use in another. Third, it reflected a pervading, perhaps
chauvinistic, belief that the system of justice of the forum was
innately superior to that of others.<SUP><A HREF="#22">22</A></SUP> 
<P>
The test became increasingly difficult to meet as time went on
because the words oppressive and vexatious had taken on a much
stronger meaning than they had when the test was first developed.<SUP><A HREF="#23">23</A></SUP>
By the mid seventies the word <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>oppressive<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT>
had come to mean morally delinquent while the word <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>vexatious<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT>
had come to refer to the irresponsible pursuit of litigation.<SUP><A HREF="#24">24</A></SUP>
In <I>The Atlantic Star</I><SUP><A HREF="#25">25</A></SUP> the House of Lords recognized
that these definitions created too difficult a test and proposed
that the test be modernized by changing the definition of the
words and interpreting them more liberally.<SUP><A HREF="#26">26</A></SUP> The House
of Lords pointed out, however, that a juridical advantage to the
plaintiff remained a solid and often decisive factor in determining

<P>
The inadequacy of a more liberal interpretation of the words <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>oppressive
and vexatious<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> as a
solution to the problem was made clear in <I>MacShannon v. Rockware
Glass Limited</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#28">28</A></SUP> In that case, the plaintiffs were
Scottish workers who had been injured in industrial accidents
in Scotland but who brought actions for damages in England. English
courts could technically assume jurisdiction because the defendant
had a registered office in England. <BR>
<P>
The employer sought to have the English actions stayed on the
basis that Scotland was the more appropriate forum but failed
both at first instance and in the Court of Appeal because it could
not be said that an action against the defendant in England was
oppressive or vexatious. On appeal to the House of Lords, the
court concluded, that the vexatious and oppressive test had caused
confusion<SUP><A HREF="#29">29</A></SUP> and reformulated it. <BR>
<P>
Under the <I>MacShannon</I> test, a defendant who wished to stay
an action had to establish:<BR>
<P>
(a) that there is another forum to which the defendant is amenable
in which justice can be done at substantially less inconvenience
or expense; <U>and<BR>
</U>
<P>
(b) that the stay did not deprive the plaintiff of a legitimate
personal or juridical advantage.<BR>
<P>
Applying this new test to the facts in <I>MacShannon,</I> the
House of Lords noted that all of the witnesses resided in Scotland
and that it would cost between <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">,</FONT>200
and <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">,</FONT>450 more to try
the actions in England<SUP><A HREF="#30">30</A></SUP> as a result of which it concluded
that justice could be done at substantially less inconvenience
or expense in Scotland. The plaintiffs<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>
evidence that England provided them with juridical advantages
in the form of increased damages and better pleadings was simply
not believed.<BR>
<P>
The MacShannon test, however, continued to give great weight to
convenience in its first branch and to juridical advantage in
its second branch. Indeed, courts were directed not to spend time
speculating about what constituted a <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>legitimate<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT>
juridical advantage.<SUP><A HREF="#31">31</A><BR>
</SUP>
<P>
c) The <I>Spiliada </I>Test<!--) The Spiliada Test--><BR>
<P>
The House of Lords had further occasion to refine the concepts
of convenience and juridical advantage in <I>Spiliada Maritime
Corporation v. Cansulex Ltd.</I><SUP><A HREF="#32">32</A></SUP> by which time it
had formally accepted the doctrine of <I>forum non conveniens</I>
into English law.<SUP><A HREF="#33">33</A></SUP> <BR>
<P>
In <I>Spiliada</I>, a Liberian ship had been chartered to carry
a cargo of bulk sulphur from Vancouver to India. The ship owners
alleged that the cargo was wet when loaded and, as a result, caused
severe corrosion to the vessel. The ship owners obtained leave
to serve the shipper <I>ex juris</I> in Canada on the ground that
it was an action to recover damages for breach of a contract which
was governed by English law. The shippers moved to set aside service
or stay the action on the basis that England was not the convenient
forum. <BR>
<P>
The House of Lords took pains to point out that the doctrine of
<I>forum</I> <I>non conveniens</I> was based not on practical
convenience but on the appropriateness of a particular forum.
<SUP><A HREF="#34">34</A></SUP> Their lordship<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
also recognized that the mere presence of a juridical advantage
could not be decisive and that it is not necessarily unjust to
compel a plaintiff to use a different legal system.<SUP><A HREF="#35">35</A></SUP>
Their lordship<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s then
took these considerations into account and reformulated the test
to stay an action based on the principle of <I>forum</I> <I>non
conveniens</I>. Under the <I>Spiliada </I>formulation, a stay
will be granted if:<I> <BR>
</I>
<P>
(a) there is another forum in which the matter could be tried
more suitably for the interests of the parties and the ends of
justice; <BR>
<P>
(b) if such a forum exists and the plaintiff wishes to retain
England as the forum, he must establish special circumstances
by reason of which justice requires that the action proceed in
England.<SUP><A HREF="#36">36</A><BR>
</SUP>
<P>
In its formulation, at least, the <I>Spiliada</I> test marks a
significant change in the direction of the law. The first branch
of the test changes the focus from convenience and expense to
the interests of the parties and the end of justice. The second
branch, in its formulation at least, decreases the significance
of juridical advantages. Under the <I>MacShannon</I> test, the
plaintiff had the right to enjoy the juridical advantages offered
by the forum of his choice even where there was another forum
which was more appropriate. Under the <I>Spiliada</I> formulation,
a juridical advantage is no longer an absolute right which the
plaintiff may enjoy. Rather, the plaintiff must establish that
ends of justice require that he have the benefit of the juridical
advantage.<SUP><A HREF="#37">37</A><BR>
</SUP>
<P>
d) The <I>Amchem </I>Test<!--d) The Amchem Test--><BR>
<P>
Until recently, Canadian courts followed the two&#173;step tests
established in <I>MacShannon</I> and <I>Spiliada</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#38">38</A><BR>
</SUP>
<P>
In 1993 the Supreme Court of Canada reformulated these tests significantly
in <I>Amchem Products Inc. v. British Columbia (Workers<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>
Compensation Board)</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#39">39</A></SUP> In reformulating the test,
the Supreme Court collapsed the two branches into one and held
that a stay should only be granted if the applicant could establish
that there was another forum which was clearly more appropriate
than Canada for the pursuit of the action and for securing the
ends of justice.<SUP><A HREF="#40">40</A><BR>
</SUP>
<P>
Although the court noted that it is up to the applicant to establish
<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>clearly<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT>
that a more appropriate forum exists in order to displace the
plaintiff<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s choice,
it added that the burden of proof should not play a significant
role in the decision but should be relied on only when the materials
do not enable a judge to make a determinative finding.<SUP><A HREF="#41">41</A></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
This reformulation does away with loss of juridical advantage
as a separate branch of the test thereby making stays significantly
easier to obtain. Under the <I>Amchem</I> test, a juridical advantage
is simply one of a lengthy list of factors to be taken into account
when determining whether there is another forum which is more
appropriate. While juridical advantages may continue to be an
important factor, they are not to rule the day.<BR>
<P>
More importantly, when referring to the weight to be ascribed
to a juridical advantage, the court held that the legitimacy of
any advantage depended upon the reasonableness of the expectation
that such an advantage would be available to the party if litigation
resulted.<SUP><A HREF="#42">42</A></SUP> This appears to be the first express recognition
of reasonable expectations as a basis for assessing the validity
of a claim to a juridical advantage. Unfortunately the court did
not go on to assess the legitimacy of the juridical advantages
claimed in <I>Amchem</I> because it decided the case based on
a new test for anti-suit injunctions which it developed.<SUP><A HREF="#43">43</A></SUP>
Indeed, as argued later in this paper, the actual result, seems
to ignore the reasonable expectations of the parties. <BR>
<P>
The express reference to reasonable expectations is nevertheless
a welcome step towards the development of a principled approach
to forum shopping cases. Reasonable expectations should arguably
play a decisive role not only in determining whether a party is
entitled to a particular juridical advantage but also in determining
which is the appropriate forum on the whole. We will test this
by: <BR>
<P>
(a) examining the origins of reasonable expectations analysis;

a) The Origins of Reasonable Expectations Analysis<!--) The Origins of Reasonable Expectations Analysis-->
<BR>
<P>
The express reference to reasonable expectations in <I>Amchem</I>
marks a recognition of what, it is submitted, courts have been
endeavouring to accomplish for some time. Although the focus on
vexation, oppression, convenience or the plaintiff<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
right to a juridical advantage may have been appropriate for a
world in which there were fewer well developed legal systems,
in which travelling to another forum for a trial was truly burdensome
and in which foreign judgments were not enforced as easily as
they are today, those concerns are no longer relevant in an era
of globalization of business, instant communication, ease of travel,
video technology and mutual enforcement of judgments.<BR>
<P>
The case law has struggled to take these changing realities into
account but, has been burdened by the need to apply formulations
which no longer respond to contemporary concerns. While courts
state openly that the selection of a forum or the assumption of
jurisdiction should be based on a sense of order and fairness
rather than on the counting up of mechanical factors<SUP><A HREF="#44">44</A></SUP>
courts still continue to use the factors as a checklist and weigh
them rather mechanically. <BR>
<P>
In Canada, reasonable expectations analysis in conflicts of law
appears to originate from choice of law cases involving different
provinces. In <I>Moran</I> v. <I>Pyle National (Canada) Limited</I>,<SUP><A HREF="#45">45</A></SUP>
for example, an electrician was fatally injured in Saskatchewan
by a light bulb which had allegedly been negligently manufactured
in Ontario. The issue before the Supreme Court of Canada was whether
the action should be tried in Saskatchewan as desired by the deceased's
estate and widow or in Ontario as desired by the manufacturer.
The legal issue was whether the tort occurred in the place of
manufacture or the place of injury. The court avoided setting
a hard and fast rule to this issue <SUP><A HREF="#46">46</A></SUP> but concluded
that, where a foreign defendant carelessly manufactures a product
in a foreign jurisdiction which enters into normal channels of
trade and it is foreseeable that a plaintiff would use the product
in the jurisdiction in which he does, then the forum in which
the plaintiff uses the product may appropriately exercise jurisdiction.
<BR>
<P>
Although the court was, strictly speaking, addressing the issue
of jurisdiction rather than that of an appropriate forum, it was,
for all intents and purposes, determining the most appropriate
jurisdiction in which the action could be tried and was engaging
in reasonable expectations analysis when coming to a conclusion
based on foreseeability. A plaintiff who purchases a product and
uses it in his home forum expects the law and the courts of his
home forum to govern. To hold otherwise would suggest that there
are different laws and forums which govern the purchase of products
depending on where they were manufactured. Similarly, a defendant
has reason to expect that if he enters a foreign jurisdiction
either personally or through his products, he must comply with
the laws and submit to the courts of that jurisdiction. Subsequent
Canadian decisions have expressly referred to reasonable expectations
when deciding which choice of law should govern a particular transaction.<SUP><A HREF="#47">47</A>
<BR>
</SUP>
<P>
b) Are Past Cases Consistent with Reasonable Expectations Analysis?<!--b) Are Past Cases Consistent with Reasonable Expectations Analysis?-->
<BR>
<P>
Reasonable expectation analysis was not openly applied to <I>forum
non conveniens</I> cases because precedent required that they
be determined with reference to the list of connecting factors.
The list of connecting factors forced the courts to adopt rather
unusual logic so that their decisions would conform to these rather
formalistic rules when open acknowledgement of reasonable expectations
would have been logically simpler and more consistent with the
results of the cases.<BR>
<P>
This is perhaps best demonstrated by the <I>MacShannon</I> case
where, Scottish workers who had been injured in industrial accidents
in Scotland attempted to bring an action against their employer
in England. Lord Justice Stevenson in the Court of Appeal readily
admitted that <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>Anyone
with nothing but common sense to guide him would say that they
ought to be tried in Scotland.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT><SUP><A HREF="#48">48</A></SUP>
The Court of Appeal had only legal rules to guide it and felt
bound to order that the actions be tried in England because, under
the prevailing test at the time, it could not be said that an
action in England was vexatious or oppressive to the employer,
who also had a registered office in England. 
<P>
The House of Lords assisted by reformulating the test to be whether
justice could be done elsewhere at substantially less inconvenience
or expense. Their Lordships then determined the matter by noting
that trying the matters in England would result in hotel expenses
for witnesses of between <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">,</FONT>200
and <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">,</FONT>450 per action
and concluded that justice could be done less expensively in Scotland.<SUP><A HREF="#49">49</A></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
While the result is sensible, it seems odd that Scottish workers
injured at a Scottish workplace in Scotland are prevented from
suing in England solely because of the cost of a hotel room. Surely
there are more compelling reasons why the actions should be tried
in Scotland. The fundamental expectation of every worker who is
injured in an industrial accident is that their rights will be
determined in the jurisdiction in which they work according to
the laws of that jurisdiction. Given this fundamental starting
point it seems curious to base the legal requirement that they
bring an action in their home forum on the cost of hotels in a
foreign jurisdiction.<BR>
<P>
In <I>Spiliada Maritime Corporation</I> v. <I>Cansulex Ltd</I><SUP><A HREF="#50">50</A></SUP>,
the House of Lords also implicitly applied reasonable expectations
analysis. As noted above, the court stated that a juridical advantage
was not decisive and recognized that it was not necessarily unjust
to compel a plaintiff to use a different legal system.<SUP><A HREF="#51"></A>51</SUP>
In assessing the type of juridical advantage to which a plaintiff
was entitled, the court examined a hypothetical scenario involving
a plaintiff's right to benefit from limitation periods in different
jurisdictions. The court first considered the example of a plaintiff
who started an action in England which was later challenged by
the defendant as <I>forum non conveniens</I> after the limitation
period in the jurisdiction espoused by the defendant had expired.
If the foreign jurisdiction were the better forum but it had been
reasonable for the plaintiff to commence the action in England,
it would be fair to stay the English action on the condition that
the defendant waived its right to a time bar defence.<SUP><A HREF="#52">52</A></SUP>
This result reflects the reasonable expectation that the action
would be tried in the foreign forum but also recognizes that parties
may reasonably have different views of these expectations and
ought not to suffer because of those views, provided they are
reasonable. If, however, the plaintiff was irresponsible in commencing
the action in England and did so after deliberately letting a
limitation period expire elsewhere in order to benefit from a
juridical advantage in England, the court may take a harsher view
of the matter and stay the action without conditions.<SUP><A HREF="#53">53</A></SUP>
This also reflects the reasonable expectations of the parties
and enforces those expectations by visiting consequences on those
who ignore or circumvent them.<BR>
<P>
In the end result, the court explained its decision in <I>Spiliada</I>
on a more traditional basis by considering a checklist of factors
including the fact that the contract between the plaintiff and
the defendant was governed by English law. This would arguably
create an expectation that Britain would be the convenient forum.
The court, however, did not focus on the choice of law clause
in the contract as the determining factor but on the fact that
a very similar case was proceeding through the British courts
at that time.<SUP><A HREF="#54">54</A></SUP> Since the case involved extensive and
highly technical expert evidence concerning the corrosive effect
of sulphur on a ship's hold, the House of Lords determined that
the expertise developed by the lawyers and judge on that case
tipped the balance in favour of British Courts. <SUP><A HREF="#55">55</A></SUP>
While the result is eminently sensible, the deciding factor of
a similar case is perhaps curious in light of the court's earlier
statement that the issue should not be determined as a matter
of practical convenience but as a question of the appropriateness
or the suitability of a forum to secure the ends of justice.<SUP><A HREF="#56">56</A></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
Arguably a decision by the parties that English law governs should
make England the forum which most closely reflects the parties'
reasonable expectations. Even though the contract did not specifically
provide that the courts of England were to govern, the typical
business person would probably expect that, absent other considerations,
a contract which was to be determined in accordance with English
law would also best be determined by English courts. <BR>
<P>
Ironically, it is in <I>Amchem</I>,<SUP><A HREF="#57">57</A></SUP> the case in which
the Supreme Court of Canada explicitly recognized the importance
of reasonable expectations in assessing a juridical advantage,
that the reasonable expectations of the parties were, in fact,
defeated. In that case, the Workers<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>
Compensation Board of British Columbia brought a large number
of subrogated actions for damages on behalf of workers to whom
it had paid benefits. The actions were brought against a number
of asbestos manufacturers and suppliers. Although the workers
had all been injured in British Columbia, the Board brought the
actions in Texas. Texas had a legal basis for assuming jurisdiction
because each of the defendants carried on business there. The
defendant sought to have the Texas action stayed but failed, in
large part because Texas did not apply the doctrine of <I>forum
non conveniens</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#58">58</A><BR>
</SUP>
<P>
Although the Supreme Court of Canada developed a new test for
stays in Canada, it was not required to apply that test because
the case came to it as an anti-suit injunction to enjoin the Texas
proceedings. While this aspect of the case and the implications
of reasonable expectations analysis in anti-suit injunctions is
discussed elsewhere in this paper,<SUP><A HREF="#59">59</A></SUP> the Court rejected
the request for an injunction and allowed the Texas actions to
continue. It is difficult to believe, however, that employees
working in British Columbia who are injured as a result of workplace
injuries in British Columbia have any expectation of arguing their
claims in Texas.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
c) Why should Reasonable Expectations Be Used as a Guide? <!--c) Why should Reasonable Expectations Be Used as a Guide? -->
<BR>
<P>
Like any other legal test, using reasonable expectations as a
guide to resolving forum shopping cases serves little purpose
if it is simply based on an assumption by a court about what the
expectations of the parties are without further inquiry into what
this means and what social values the court is seeking to protect
by enforcing them.<SUP><A HREF="#60">60</A></SUP> <BR>
<P>
The reasonable expectations of the parties provide a desirable
basis for deciding forum shopping cases because it focuses the
inquiry on the legitimacy of a party<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
claim to a certain juridical or personal advantage. In most cases,
the advantage will be juridical and will relate either to the
substantive or procedural law of the desired forum. Reasonable
expectations analysis recognizes that the legal system and the
juridical advantages of any one forum are a product of a complete
social contract. Damage awards or other juridical advantages cannot
be looked at in isolation. They are part of a larger series of
trade-offs. <BR>
<P>
In <I>Amchem</I> for example, the Workers<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>
Compensation Board was seeking not only to recover amounts which
it had paid out in benefits to the disabled employees but it was
also seeking general damages on the scale awarded by Texas courts.
The Board then intended to pay these additional damages to the
employees in question. In doing so the Board was trying to avoid
the generally lower damages awards that are made in Canada and
in particular, it would have been trying to circumvent the limits
on non-pecuniary damages established by the Supreme Court of Canada.<SUP><A HREF="#61">61</A></SUP>
On a reasonable expectations analysis this is an entirely inappropriate
goal. Forums with lower damage awards may offer other compensating
social advantages instead. There are, for example, significant
social policy differences between Canada and the United States
which may make lower damage awards more appropriate in Canada.
Canada offers significantly more generous social programs than
Texas does. Canada has universal, state funded medical care out
of which one cannot contract. In addition, Canada has a funded
Workers<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT> Compensation
system pursuant to which Canadian workers have given up their
rights to tort damages in exchange for guaranteed compensation
by a Workers<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT> Compensation
Board. In <I>Amchem</I> it appears that at least one of the asbestos
companies (Atlas) was a registered employer under the British
Columbia Workers<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT> Compensation
scheme and may have been entitled to immunity from action in British
Columbia. These are all elements of a social contract of which
the plaintiffs in <I>Amchem</I> had enjoyed the benefits for many
years. As citizens of a democratic country they participated in
its formation. To reap the benefits of that social contract while
refusing to bear the burden, ultimately subverts the policy choices
made by Canadian courts and legislatures.<BR>
<P>
The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately did not grant the anti-suit
injunction in <I>Amchem</I> because it was concerned that doing
so would interfere with the principles of comity. While comity
is a principle to be considered in anti-suit injunctions, it should
arguably also be considered when considering motions to stay.
By allowing the action to proceed in Texas, the Texas court unwittingly
participated in undermining the Canadian social contract, albeit
in a relatively inconsequential manner. Had the Texas court enforced
the reasonable expectations of the parties and stayed the Texas
proceedings in favour of British Columbia proceedings, it would
have demonstrated a respect for comity and a respect for the social
policy choices made by another country as reflected in its legal
system.<BR>
<P>
Quite apart from policy choices, lower damage awards in some forums
also reflect lower costs of living and differing living standards.
Without wishing to be mean spirited, a plaintiff is meant to be
compensated for his damages. He is not entitled to a windfall.
By awarding American style personal injury claims to plaintiffs
in countries with lower costs of living, plaintiffs are obtaining
a significant windfall to the detriment of defendants or their
insurers who had a reasonable expectation that lower damage awards
would apply and who factored those lower awards into the cost
of doing business. <BR>
<P>
Enforcing the reasonable expectations of the parties also avoids
inequitable outcomes between plaintiffs. Take <I>Amchem </I>as
an example. Assume there are two British Columbia plaintiffs who
have been injured in an identical manner in British Columbia.
One has been injured as a result of the act of a defendant who
also happens to carry on business in the United States. The other
has been injured as a result of a defendant who does not carry
on business in the United States. Although both plaintiffs have
suffered identical damages and will incur identical costs in Canada,
the former enjoys a substantial windfall because he had the good
fortune to be injured by someone who quite coincidentally does
business in the United States. The latter will receive a significantly
lower damage award. There does not appear to be any rational basis
for treating the two individuals differently. The incorporation
of reasonable expectations analysis by courts hearing any motions
for stay would ensure that the two are treated in a similar fashion.
<BR>
<P>
Similar arguments can be made with respect to cases which grant
stays on the condition that the one party be permitted to enjoy
a particular juridical advantage. If one country has, for example,
adopted a narrower form of discovery, it has presumably done so
for good reason. The procedural rules of any system contain a
number of trade-offs. While one forum may have more restricted
rules of discovery, it may compensate for that limitation by other
procedural or substantive rights which are not available in another
forum. To impose one forum<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
discovery rules ( or other juridical advantage) on another constitutes
cherry picking which interferes with the judicial balance and
policy choices made by the courts and legislatures of the other
forum.<BR>
<P>
In most cases it is relatively easy to determine objectively what
the reasonable expectations of the parties were. In cases where
objective circumstances do not lead to one conclusion or another,
it may be appropriate for the parties to introduce evidence concerning
their expectations and the basis for them. In addition to explaining
why objective factors led one party to have a certain expectation,
such evidence might also introduce facts about whether one party
led another to believe in a certain result either expressly or
implicitly by silence in the face of the other<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
communication of a particular expectation. Such evidence does,
however, carry the danger of self serving re-characterizations
long after the fact as a result of which it is probably more desirable
to base decisions on an objective consideration of those expectations.
<BR>
<P>
d) Reasonable Expectations in More Difficult Cases<!--d) Reasonable Expectations in More Difficult Cases-->
<BR>
<P>
The cases examined so far have been relatively easy to assess
in terms of reasonable expectations. Some fact situations pose
greater difficulty. Perhaps the most difficult situation to deal
with using reasonable expectations analysis is one where the defendant
has no assets in the <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>natural
forum<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> and where a judgment
from the natural forum would not be readily enforced in the forum(s)
in which the defendant has assets. In this type of case, it would
clearly be inequitable to prevent the plaintiff from proceeding
in the forum in which the defendant has assets.<BR>
<P>
A second category of difficult cases involves ships. It has been
said that every port is a forum shoppers emporium.<SUP><A HREF="#62">62</A></SUP>
Even here, however, reasonable expectations analysis is helpful.
Two examples may assist in demonstrating this: <I>Antares Shipping
Corporation v. The Capricorn</I><SUP><A HREF="#63">63</A></SUP> and <I>Castanho
v. Brown &amp; Root (U.K.)Ltd.<SUP><A HREF="#64">64</A></SUP> <BR>
</I>
<P>
In part, <I>Antares</I> raises the problem of the judgment proof
defendant described in the previous paragraph. In <I>Antares</I>,
the plaintiff was a Liberian corporation which claimed to have
purchased the vessel Capricorn from Delmar, another Liberian corporation
under an agreement of purchase and sale governed by English law.
While the ship was en route to Canada, Delmar purported to sell
it to another Liberian corporation named Portland pursuant to
an agreement of purchase and sale governed by American law and
through registration of a bill of sale in the United States. Antares
had the ship arrested in Quebec City, its first port of call after
the transfer to Portland.<BR>
<P>
The Supreme Court of Canada conceded that England, the United
States and Liberia were all jurisdictions with connections to
the facts but concluded that no one of those jurisdictions was
more convenient than Canada. It then assessed a checklist of factors
including the fact that Delmar's and Portland's only assets were
in Canada in the form of bail for the ship which had been released.
<BR>
<P>
The decision is arguably consistent with the reasonable expectations
of the parties. The court expressly recognized the significance
of <I>in rem</I> jurisdiction in admiralty matters<SUP><A HREF="#65">65</A></SUP>
and recognized that the only effective jurisdiction in those cases
is often the location of the ship especially if it is owned by
a shell corporation.<SUP><A HREF="#66">66</A></SUP> Ship owners are presumably aware
of <I>in rem</I> jurisdiction and are aware that part of its significance
stems from the manner in which they have arranged their affairs
to limit liability. Given the internationally recognized authority
to arrest ships in appropriate circumstances, a ship owner cannot
complain if a ship is arrested in another jurisdiction as a result
of a complaint against the owner.<BR>
<P>
A more difficult scenario would arise had the plaintiff sought
to arrest the ship not in its first port of call after the fraudulent
transfer, but in some later port of call in order to reap the
benefit of a juridical advantage offered by the later port. In
such cases it might be appropriate to require the plaintiff to
show good reason for not having moved more quickly and to have
the plaintiff establish its own expectations for believing that
the later port was the appropriate forum.<BR>
<P>
In<I> Castanho,</I> a Portuguese sailor was paralysed from the
neck down as a result of injuries he received on board a ship
while that ship was in an English port. After his injury, Mr.
Castanho returned to Portugal but started an action for damages
in England. One and a half years after starting the English action,
and after having received payments after an admission of liability
by the ship owners, Mr. Castanho started proceedings in a Texas
court on the basis that the ship was ultimately owned by Texas
defendants. <BR>
<P>
The case came to the House of Lords as an anti-suit injunction
to enjoin Mr. Castanho from prosecuting the Texas action (the
injunctive aspect of the case will be discussed later in this
paper). The House of Lords concluded that England was a forum
in which justice could be achieved at a lower cost but found that
the English action would deprive Mr. Castanho of the juridical
advantage of higher damage awards in Texas and permitted Mr. Castanho
to proceed with the Texas action.<BR>
<P>
The <I>Castanho</I> type case is one in which it is arguably more
difficult to apply reasonable expectations analysis. Since the
place of the tort is England, there is a <I>prima facie</I> reasonable
expectation that English law would apply as the <I>lex loci delicti</I>
and that it would also be the appropriate forum. <BR>
<P>
On the facts of <I>Castanho</I>, it is difficult to discern any
basis, arising from the reasonable expectations of the parties,
for a forum other than England. Indeed, as already noted, Mr.
Castanho had commenced an action there and had accepted partial
damage payments after an admission of liability by the defendant.
Nevertheless, he was permitted to proceed in Texas. On a reasonable
expectations analysis, the better result may have been to require
him to complete the English proceedings.<BR>
<P>
There are, however, competing concerns raised by these types of
cases. As a ship's employee, the plaintiff may be subject to the
tort regimes of a number of different jurisdictions. If the tort
occurs in a country with a poor tort compensation regime, should
he have to bear that risk? There is no easy answer.<BR>
<P>
On the one hand, Mr. Castanho is not unlike a tourist who visits
a country with a more rigorous tort regime. If he is injured there,
he must bear the risk of the harsher regime.
<P>
If a tourist or ship<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
employee is concerned about a tort occurring in a jurisdiction
with a harsher tort regime, this is presumably a risk against
which he can insure. Some will no doubt argue that the plaintiffs
in situations like <I>Castanho</I> tend to be relatively unsophisticated,
in many cases from developing countries in which insurance may
not be as prevalent a concept as elsewhere and that it is unrealistic
to impose an obligation to insure on such plaintiffs. In those
circumstances, it is much easier for the ship<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
owners to insure against the risk that an action will be brought
in a forum with a more generous tort compensation regime. If,
on the other hand, the concern is with less sophisticated plaintiffs
from less wealthy countries, such plaintiffs are likely to return
to their country of origin (as did Mr. Castanho), in which case
it would not appear to be that unjust to compensate them according
to the regime which exists in the place of the tort. That lower
compensation scheme may more closely reflect the cost of living
and standard of living which they would expect in their home country.
In such circumstances does the plaintiff really have a legitimate
claim to tort compensation based on an American standard of living
and an American cost of living? 
<P>
This type of case creates difficult questions which it may not
be possible to answer in a general way. As a starting point, however,
the place of the tort would still arguably be the most appropriate
forum which corresponds to the reasonable expectations of the
parties. As with any legal test, however, there may be practical
exigencies which may lead a court to depart from the rigour of
the rule. Even in such cases, however, courts should be loath
to depart from the goal of enforcing reasonable expectations.
It may simply be that the analysis of those expectations becomes
more complex.<BR>
<P>
Up to this point, we have examined reasonable expectations principally
in the context of motions to stay proceedings. Their use as an
analytical tool also arises when considering anti-suit injunctions
and negative declarations, both of which might add the complicating
factor of judicial comity into the mix. <BR>
<P>
V. ANTI-SUIT INJUNCTIONS<BR>
<!--V.  ANTI-SUIT INJUNCTIONS-->
<P>
a) Background<!--a) Background--><BR>
<P>
An anti-suit injunction is a proceeding by an applicant to enjoin
a respondent from prosecuting an action against the applicant
in a foreign jurisdiction. <BR>
<P>
Like the test for stays, the test for granting anti-suit injunctions
has evolved significantly in recent years. Despite this evolution,
Anglo Canadian case law remains difficult to work with because
it does not openly address the policies or purposes which courts
seek to advance when considering anti-suit injunctions. The express
recognition of reasonable expectations in anti-suit injunctions
would, it is submitted, simplify the law and reduce the risk of
conflicting judicial outcomes. <BR>
<P>
The contemporary starting point of Anglo Canadian law on anti-suit
injunctions is <I>Castanho v. Brown &amp; Root (U.K.) Ltd.</I><SUP><A HREF="#67">67</A></SUP>
where the House of Lords held that the test for granting an anti-suit
injunction was the same as that for granting a motion to stay
an action for <I>forum non conveniens. </I>When transposing the
test for stays at that time to anti-suit injunctions, the result
was that, in order to obtain an anti-suit injunction the applicant
had to establish:<BR>
<P>
i) that justice could be done at less inconvenience and expense
in the United Kingdom; and<BR>
<P>
ii) that granting the injunction would not deprive the plaintiff
of a juridical advantage in the foreign jurisdiction .<BR>
<P>
b) The Test in Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale<!--b) The Test in Soci--><FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J<!--t-->J<!-- Aerospatiale--></FONT>
<BR>
<P>
After <I>Castanho</I> was decided, the test for stays was changed
by <I>Spiliada.<SUP><A HREF="#68">68</A></SUP></I> By implication this also changed
the test for injunctions . Anti-suit injunctions next came before
the House of Lords (sitting as the Privy Council) in <I>Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale</I> v. <I>Lee Kui Jak.</I><SUP><A HREF="#69">69</A></SUP>
Their Lordships felt that if the <I>Spiliada</I> test were applied
to anti-suit injunctions, an injunction would be granted if England
were the natural forum and justice did not require that the action
be allowed to continue in the foreign court.<SUP><A HREF="#70">70</A></SUP> Their
Lordships felt that this test meant that injunctions would almost
always be granted if the court concluded that England was the
natural forum because it would be unusual that justice required
that the action be allowed to proceed in a foreign court.<SUP><A HREF="#71">71</A></SUP>
This, it was felt, would be inconsistent both with comity and
the fundamental requirement that an injunction be granted only
where the ends of justice require.<SUP><A HREF="#72">72</A></SUP> As a result, the
Privy Council formulated a new test for anti-suit injunctions
and stated that they would be granted only if<BR>
<P>
i) England were a natural forum ; and<BR>
<P>
ii) the pursuit of the foreign action would be vexatious or oppressive
to the defendant in the foreign action.<BR>
<P>
A close reading of the <I>Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale</I> decision arguably reveals that the Privy Council
was more concerned with enforcing the reasonable expectations
of the parties (without actually saying so) than it was with applying
its newly formulated test. <BR>
<P>
The action arose out of a helicopter accident in Brunei in which
a wealthy citizen of Brunei was killed. The helicopter was manufactured
by a French company, Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale, was owned by an English company and maintained by
a Malaysian company. An accident report prepared by Brunei authorities
concluded that the accident was probably caused by faulty maintenance.
There was an argument that the faulty maintenance may have resulted
from poorly written instructions in the maintenance manual but
this, at least on the facts described by the Privy Council<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
decision, seemed difficult to support.<SUP><A HREF="#73">73</A></SUP> The deceased<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
widow, Lee Kui Jak, commenced proceedings in Brunei and in Texas.
Texas law permitted jurisdiction because <I>Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale</I> conducted business in Texas, albeit only by selling
products to a subsidiary.<SUP><A HREF="#74">74</A></SUP> The plaintiff wished to
proceed in Texas because of its more favourable product liability
laws and more favourable damage awards.<SUP><A HREF="#75">75</A></SUP> The Texas
court rejected Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale's motion to stay the Texas action and, in keeping
with the practice of that court, gave no reasons for its decision.<SUP><A HREF="#76">76</A>
<BR>
</SUP>
<P>
Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale then brought an anti-suit injunction in Brunei to
restrain the plaintiff from prosecuting the Texas lawsuit. The
Privy Council noted the complicating factor of comity when dealing
with anti-suit injunctions but also noted that an anti-suit injunction
is not directed against a foreign court, but against an individual
who is under the jurisdiction of the enjoining court.<SUP><A HREF="#77">77</A></SUP>
This presumably lessens the importance of comity significantly.
<BR>
<P>
The court found that Brunei was the natural forum because the
action arose out of the death in Brunei, of a citizen of Brunei
and that Brunei law applied. The court noted in particular that
Brunei law applied a principle known as damages for lost years
which the court described as a difficult concept even for experienced
judges.<SUP><A HREF="#78">78</A></SUP> It is noteworthy that the court seems to
be suggesting that it is preferable to have the law of the action
decided by the forum which normally applies that law. This is
an encouraging presumption to further. As noted earlier, the application
of foreign law is sometimes a bit of a fiction because courts
tend to apply foreign law in light of their own preconceptions
and values. It stands to reason that if a court ordinarily applies
strict liability principles it would not be as adept at applying
fault principles as would a court which applies fault principles
regularly. A further reason for preferring that the action be
tried by the court whose law governs, is that foreign law is usually
proved as a matter of fact. As a result, no appeal ordinarily
lies on the interpretation of foreign law. This effectively deprives
both parties of a juridical advantage which they reasonably expect
to enjoy.<BR>
<P>
With respect to the natural forum, the court also noted that the
plaintiff resided in Brunei as did the deceased, that the deceased
had a substantial income which depended on the rather volatile
oil industry and which would require expert evidence to prove.
Against this there was nothing to connect the action with Texas.<SUP><A HREF="#79">79</A></SUP>
Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale therefore succeeded on the first branch of the test.
<BR>
<P>
The second branch, establishing that the Texas proceeding was
vexatious and oppressive was more difficult. Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale argued that it sought contribution from the company
which maintained the helicopters. Under the relevant contributory
negligence legislation it was uncertain whether it could claim
indemnity from the maintenance company based on a Texas judgment.
Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale may have been required to bring a fresh action against
the maintenance company in Brunei and establish liability afresh.
The Privy Council found this to be vexatious and oppressive to
Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale even though the claim for contribution and indemnity
was made only after Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale had applied for the injunction in Brunei and failed.<SUP><A HREF="#80">80</A>
<BR>
</SUP>
<P>
Although the court referred to the difficulty of commencing an
action against the helicopter maintenance company, Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale might have been able to join them as a necessary
party to the Texas litigation.<SUP><A HREF="#81">81</A></SUP> Thus, even though
Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale might have had to commence a fresh action against
the maintenance company in Brunei to enforce the Texas judgment,
the liability issues would arguably be <I>res</I> <I>judicata</I>.
<BR>
<P>
It is also worth recalling that the House of Lords had stated
in <I>The Atlantic Star</I><SUP><A HREF="#82">82</A></SUP> that oppressive meant
morally delinquent and that vexatious referred to the irresponsible
pursuit of litigation. It is doubtful that the Texas action was
either morally delinquent or irresponsible. It is unclear from
the Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale case whether oppressive and vexatious meant morally
delinquent and irresponsible or whether the Privy Council meant
to refer to the more liberal interpretation advocated by the House
of Lords in <I>The Atlantic Star</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#83">83</A></SUP> It is submitted
that the Privy Council sensibly did not consider these issues
because they were in fact endeavouring to enforce the reasonable
expectations of the parties. The simple fact that Texas is prepared
to extend jurisdiction over Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>
Aerospatiale because it happens to sell helicopters to a subsidiary
in Texas does not give the plaintiff any reasonable expectation
that the damages she sustained as a result of the death in Brunei,
of a citizen of Brunei would be litigated in Texas. Most peoples<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>
reasonable expectation would be that Brunei is the natural forum.
Perhaps Malaysia (if the maintenance was carried out there); perhaps
France (if the instructions were flawed) but not Texas. <BR>
<P>
c) The Test in <I>Amchem<!--) The Test in Amchem--> <BR>
</I>
<P>
In <I>Amchem,<SUP><A HREF="#84">84</A></SUP></I> the Supreme Court of Canada had
occasion to review the Canadian test for anti-suit injunctions.
<BR>
<P>
Although, as noted above, <I>Amchem</I> explicitly recognized
reasonable expectations as a basis for determining whether a plaintiff
was entitled to claim the benefit of a juridical advantage, the
result of the case seems to defeat those expectations. <BR>
<P>
In<I> Amchem,</I> it will be recalled, the Workers<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>
Compensation Board of British Columbia brought a subrogated claim
in Texas against manufacturers and distributors of asbestos. The
claim was to recover payments which the Board had made to British
Columbian employees for asbestos related disabilities which arose
from employment in British Columbia. In addition, the Board claimed
general damages on behalf of the employees on a damage scale as
normally awarded by Texas courts.<BR>
<P>
The defendants sought to have the Texas action stayed but failed
in large part because Texas does not apply the doctrine of <I>forum
non conveniens</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#85">85</A></SUP> The defendants then sought an
anti-suit injunction in Canada to restrain the Board from proceeding
in Texas. The defendants succeeded at first instance and in the
British Columbia Court of Appeal but failed in the Supreme Court
of Canada.<BR>
<P>
The starting point of the analysis for the Supreme Court of Canada
was comity.<SUP><A HREF="#86">86</A></SUP> The court stated that an anti-suit injunction
should not even be entertained unless a suit has been commenced
in a foreign jurisdiction, the defendant has applied for a stay
in the foreign court and failed.<SUP><A HREF="#87">87</A></SUP> <BR>
<P>
Having failed to obtain a stay in the foreign jurisdiction, the
defendant may then apply to a Canadian court for an anti-suit
injunction. In considering the issue, a Canadian court should
grant the injunction only if: <BR>
<P>
i) the foreign court assumed jurisdiction on a basis which is
inconsistent with the Canadian principles of f<I>orum non conveniens;</I>
and<BR>
<P>
ii) an injustice would result if the foreign proceedings were
permitted to continue.<BR>
<P>
On a straight forward application, the two branch test in <I>Amchem</I>
makes anti-suit injunctions extremely difficult to obtain in Canada.
<BR>
<P>
As a condition precedent, the Court will not even entertain the
application unless there is a suit pending in a foreign jurisdiction
and that foreign jurisdiction has refused to stay the action.
This is presumably because a Canadian court should not interfere
with a foreign court<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
decision to accept or decline jurisdiction. It may be questioned
whether this is truly a requirement of comity. Would it offend
comity if a Canadian court directed a Canadian resident not to
commence an action in a foreign country? At that point, the Canadian
court arguably has complete jurisdiction over the Canadian resident.
While the situation may be different if the injunction seeks to
restrain a foreign resident from bringing an action in his place
of residence, it is difficult to understand why a Canadian court
should refuse to entertain an anti-suit injunction aimed at Canadian
resident simply because no foreign court has yet had an opportunity
to assume jurisdiction. At that point, a Canadian court arguably
has a greater claim to jurisdiction over its nationals than does
a foreign court.<BR>
<P>
The two branch test also accords at least as much deference to
foreign courts as does the condition precedent. On the first branch,
a Canadian court will grant an injunction only if the foreign
court assumed jurisdiction on a basis which is inconsistent with
Canadian principles of <I>forum</I> <I>non conveniens</I>. This
is noteworthy in two respects. First, the foreign court need not
have come to the correct decision about the appropriate forum,
but must merely have applied certain principles. The Supreme Court
specifically pointed out that a Canadian court should not grant
an injunction simply because it believes that Canada is the more
appropriate forum.<SUP><A HREF="#88">88</A></SUP> The foreign court is entitled
to make an erroneous decision about the appropriate forum provided
that it bases its decision on principles which are not inconsistent
with the doctrine of <I>forum non conveniens</I>. Second, the
foreign court need not actually apply the doctrine of <I>forum</I>
<I>non conveniens</I>. It may apply whatever doctrine it thinks
fit provided that it is not inconsistent with <I>forum non conveniens</I>.
The result of this is that, if the foreign court has assumed jurisdiction
on principles which are not inconsistent with <I>forum</I> <I>non
conveniens</I>, the inquiry of the Canadian court is at an end
and the injunction fails. This contrasts markedly with the test
established by the Privy Council in <I>Soci<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT>t<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</FONT></I>
<I>Aerospatiale</I> where the first branch requires an English
court to conclude only that England is a natural forum. Thus,
even if an English court concludes that the foreign forum is also
natural it may continue its analysis. <BR>
<P>
On the facts of <I>Amchem,</I> Texas did not apply the principles
<I>of forum non conveniens. </I>The Supreme Court of Canada nevertheless
found that it exercised jurisdiction in a manner which was not
inconsistent with <I>forum non conveniens</I> because its exercise
of jurisdiction was subject to the limitations imposed by the
Fourteenth Amendment and its restrictions on long-arm jurisdiction.
The Fourteenth Amendment arguably differs from <I>forum non conveniens</I>
in that the amendment addresses the circumstances in which American
courts may assume jurisdiction over a defendant.<SUP><A HREF="#89">89</A></SUP>
The doctrine of <I>forum non conveniens</I>, however, only comes
into play once a court has accepted jurisdiction under its own
laws. Under the doctrine of <I>forum non conveniens</I> a court,
having accepted jurisdiction legally, then decides whether it
is equitable or appropriate to exercise that jurisdiction. <BR>
<P>
Under the second branch of the <I>Amchem</I> test, the court is
to determine whether an injustice would result if the foreign
proceeding were permitted to continue. In most cases, the injustice
will relate to the loss of a juridical advantage.<SUP><A HREF="#90">90</A></SUP>
The party<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s right to
the juridical advantage will be determined with reference to the
party<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s reasonable expectation
to enjoy that advantage in the event of litigation.<SUP><A HREF="#91">91</A></SUP>
It is critical, however, to recall that the Court will only enquire
whether an injustice will result if the foreign court has assumed
jurisdiction according to principles which are inconsistent with
the doctrine of <I>forum non conveniens</I>. Thus, on the <I>Amchem</I>
test, a Canadian court will refuse the injunction and permit an
injustice to occur in foreign proceedings provided that the forum
assumed jurisdiction in a manner which is not inconsistent with
principles of <I>forum</I> <I>non conveniens</I>. This is a curious
result especially since injunctions originate in the equitable
jurisdiction of the Courts. The concern of equity is with justice
and fairness not with technical adherence to legal rules. The
formulation of the <I>Amchem</I> test could produce the opposite.
<BR>
<P>
Perhaps more than anything, the <I>Amchem</I> decision demonstrates
the need for courts to state expressly what they are doing and
why they are doing it rather than simply applying legal rules.
On the one hand, the Supreme Court introduced the concept of reasonable
expectations in assessing juridical advantage and in doing so
stated what it was doing and why. On the other hand, the Supreme
Court then applied rules of comity without analysing why it was
doing so on the facts of the case. Given that the case involved
injuries arising in Canada, to Canadian residents which residents
were bringing an action in Texas, in part, for the purpose of
circumventing the Supreme Court<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
own limits on non-pecuniary damages, it is arguable that principles
of comity should not even have come into play.<BR>
<P>
The difficulties created by the <I>Amchem</I> test are perhaps
best demonstrated by a series of subsequent cases involving Lehndorff
Management Ltd. (<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>Lehndorff<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT>),
a large property management company, and a syndicate of banks
headed by a Gentra Canada Investments Inc. (<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>Gentra<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT>),
a large financial institution. <BR>
<P>
Lehndorff borrowed $110 million from the syndicate and defaulted
on the loan. As a result of a compromise agreement, Lehndorff
agreed to repurchase the loan for $78 million. The compromise
agreement was conditional on the approval of the Boards of Directors
of the syndicate members. Approval was not forthcoming, as a result
of which the syndicate demanded payment on the loan. When Lehndorff
failed to pay, the syndicate moved to enforce its security, a
large commercial shopping centre located in the province of Alberta,
by commencing an action in Alberta for payment of the loan and
by having a receiver appointed to manage the shopping centre.
<BR>
<P>
Lehndorff retaliated by seeking a declaration in the province
of Ontario that the compromise agreements were in full force,
as well as an injunction to restrain the syndicate from enforcing
on its security. The syndicate moved to stay the Ontario proceedings
on principles of <I>forum non conveniens.<BR>
</I>
<P>
The Ontario court<SUP><A HREF="#92">92</A></SUP> approached its analysis by applying
the checklist of connecting factors rather than by enforcing the
expectations of the parties and concluded that Ontario was the
more appropriate forum for Lehndorff's action because the compromise
agreement was negotiated and executed in Ontario and because all
but one of the parties to the action was based in Ontario.<BR>
<P>
The syndicate then returned to Alberta and obtained an anti-suit
injunction against Lehndorff prohibiting it from proceeding with
its Ontario action. The Alberta Court of Appeal upheld the injunction.
The decisions of the two Alberta courts demonstrate that courts
will strive to preserve the reasonable expectations of the parties
no matter what legal formula they are required to massage in order
to do so.<BR>
<P>
When dealing with the anti-suit injunction, the Alberta courts
were bound to apply the <I>Amchem</I> test which would only allow
the injunction if the Ontario court had assumed jurisdiction on
a basis which was inconsistent with Alberta's rules of <I>forum
non conveniens</I> and if an injustice would result if the Ontario
action were permitted to continue.<BR>
<P>
Both Alberta and Ontario apply identical principles of <I>forum
non conveniens</I>. The Ontario court had clearly applied the
principals of <I>forum non conveniens</I> and had reviewed a lengthy
checklist of factors which it concluded made Ontario the appropriate
forum. The Alberta Court of Queen Bench<SUP><A HREF="#93">93</A></SUP> then essentially
ignored the test in <I>Amchem </I>and came to its own conclusion
as to which of the two forums was more appropriate. The Alberta
court concluded that it was the more appropriate forum because
it had <I>in rem</I> jurisdiction over the security for the loan
(the shopping centre) and that such <I>in rem</I> jurisdiction
included jurisdiction over matters incidental to the security
such as personal actions on loan deficiencies. Moreover, it pointed
out that Lehndorff's request for specific performance of the compromise
agreement directly interfered with Alberta's <I>in rem</I> jurisdiction
and that by raising the compromise agreement as the basis for
a defence and counterclaim to the Alberta enforcement proceedings,
Lehndorff agreed to be bound by that result. Arguably these considerations
established that the reasonable expectations of the parties were
to have the dispute heard in Alberta. <BR>
<P>
The majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal upheld the injunction
and tried to fit it within the <I>Amchem</I> test by finding that
the Ontario court had been unreasonable in failing to consider
the fact that Lehndorff had incorporated its claim on the compromise
agreement in the Alberta action by raising it as a basis for a
defence and counterclaim.<SUP><A HREF="#94">94</A></SUP> This may well have been
unreasonable but it clearly was not <I>inconsistent</I> with the
principles of <I>forum non conveniens</I> it simply reflected
a different way, albeit more mechanical, of balancing the connecting
factors involved in applying the principles.<BR>
<P>
The court concluded that there was injustice in forcing the syndicate
to proceed in two jurisdictions because it in effect required
the syndicate to stay its foreclosure proceedings against the
security while the Ontario action was resolved.<BR>
<P>
The reaction of the Alberta court is understandable. The difficulty
arose because the Ontario court simply looked at a mechanical
checklist of factors and did not address the reasonable expectations
of the parties. An assessment of which, it is submitted, would
lead to Alberta as the proper forum. The land and the security
which were the subject of the action were located in Alberta.
The Alberta courts therefore clearly exercised <I>in rem</I> jurisdiction.
The compromise agreement under which Lehndorff claimed arose out
of its default under the Alberta mortgage. It was therefore directly
incidental to something over which Alberta courts exercised <I>in
rem</I> jurisdiction. Indeed, had Lehndorff not defaulted on the
mortgage, the compromise documents would never even have come
into existence. The presence of these factors arguably creates
a reasonable expectation on the part of any business person that
Alberta is the proper forum. The Alberta courts appeared to agree
and were prepared to massage the <I>Amchem</I> test as aggressively
as required to fulfill those expectations. <BR>
<P>
VI. NEGATIVE DECLARATIONS<BR>
<!--VI.  NEGATIVE DECLARATIONS-->
<P>
In many respects a negative declaration is the flip side of an
anti-suit injunction. In its most literal form, a negative declaration
is a declaration that a party is not subject to a particular form
of liability arising out of the circumstances of a particular
set of events. It is most commonly brought by a party who is or
who anticipates being a defendant in a foreign jurisdiction where
the foreign jurisdiction would have less favourable rules than
the jurisdiction in which the negative declaration is sought.
In cases where both parties to a transaction may have claims against
each other, the negative declaration need not take the formal
form of a declaration as such. A party may be able to achieve
the same result by simply commencing a lawsuit in a jurisdiction
which is more favourable to them.<BR>
<P>
Negative declarations are most useful if the defendant has assets
only in the jurisdiction in which he intends to seek a negative
declaration. In such cases, a foreign plaintiff would have to
come to the jurisdiction which granted the negative declaration
in order to enforce his judgment. It is unlikely that a court
would enforce a foreign judgment if it had previously granted
a negative declaration. Negative declarations may, however, also
have some value if the intended defendant has assets in the foreign
jurisdiction. If the negative declaration is obtained before a
judgment is granted in the foreign jurisdiction, it may well render
the issue in the foreign proceeding <I>res</I> <I>judicata</I>
or may raise an issue estoppel against the plaintiff in the foreign
proceeding. <BR>
<P>
Neither the British nor the Canadian courts appear to have formulated
well-developed tests with respect to negative declarations. British
courts have expressed their distaste for negative declarations
on numerous occasions because they involve possible conflicts
with other jurisdictions.<SUP><A HREF="#95">95</A></SUP> <BR>
<P>
English courts have tended to focus on the natural forum as the
basis for deciding whether to grant a negative declaration. In
<I>First National Bank of Boston</I> v. <I>Union Bank of Switzerland</I><SUP><A HREF="#96">96</A></SUP>
for example, an employee of First National had participated in
a scheme pursuant to which he caused a branch of the Union Bank
of Switzerland (<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>UBS<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT>)
to be defrauded of $5 million. UBS commenced proceedings in Switzerland
and attached assets of First National in Geneva. First National
thereupon sought a declaration in England that it was not liable
to UBS. The court first analysed the connecting factors and concluded
that Switzerland was the appropriate forum. The court then asked
itself whether a negative declaration would <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>be
useful<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT>.<SUP><A HREF="#97">97</A></SUP>
The court concluded that a declaration would not be useful in
light of the fact that Switzerland was an appropriate jurisdiction
and that UBS could proceed against the attached assets in Switzerland.
<BR>
<P>
The Canadian experience with negative declarations has been entirely
different, although as yet quite limited.<BR>
<P>
In <I>Guarantee Company of North America</I> v. <I>Gordon Capital,</I><SUP><A HREF="#98">98</A></SUP>
Guarantee Company had issued a fidelity bond to Gordon Capital
on which Gordon Capital was claiming $35 million. Guarantee Company
denied liability on the basis of misrepresentation. At first blush,
all connecting factors pointed to Ontario as the appropriate forum.
The bond had been negotiated and issued in Ontario. Gordon Capital
was based in Ontario. The circumstances giving rise to the loss
occurred in Ontario and the bond provided that Ontario law governed.
<BR>
<P>
Gordon Capital nevertheless commenced its action for a claim on
the bond in Quebec where Guarantee Company had its head office.
Quebec had a three year limitation period while Ontario would
have applied a two year limitation period which had already expired.
<BR>
<P>
Guarantee Company brought a motion to stay the Quebec action on
the basis of <I>forum non conveniens</I>. It failed at first instance
and appealed to the Quebec Court of Appeal.<BR>
<P>
While the appeal was underway, Guarantee Company commenced a second
proceeding in Ontario for a declaration that the bond was void
because of misrepresentations by Gordon Capital. Gordon Capital
then brought a motion to stay the Ontario proceedings in view
of the Quebec action. <BR>
<P>
The court treated the motion strictly as a motion to stay a proceeding
to which only principles of <I>forum non conveniens</I> applied.
It took pains to point out that comity did not arise as an issue
because it was only relevant to anti-suit injunctions where one
court was interfering with another jurisdiction. The court did
not address the issue of negative declarations nor did it refer
to English cases which had dealt with negative declarations before.
<BR>
<P>
The Ontario court implicity enforced the reasonable expectations
of the parties and concluded that Ontario was the appropriate
forum because all connecting factors pointed to it. It dismissed
the juridical advantage to Gordon of proceeding in Quebec by finding
that it was offset by the juridical advantage to Guarantee Company
by proceeding in Ontario. The court concluded that it knew of
no reason why the two actions could not proceed in different provinces
at the same time given that the courts of both provinces were
subject to the supervision of the Supreme Court of Canada.<BR>
<P>
While the result in the decision seems sensible and certainly
accords with the reasonable expectations of the parties, particularly
in light of the fact that they had contractually agreed that Ontario
law applied, the reasoning seems strained. It is arguably too
narrow a view to state that issues of comity do not apply by characterizing
the issue strictly as one of a stay of proceedings rather than
one which might interfere with another jurisdiction. An Ontario
judgment adverse to Gordon Capital could be raised in Quebec by
way of a <I>res</I> <I>judicata</I> argument or an issue estoppel
to prevent Gordon Capital from proceeding with its action in Quebec.
In that sense it would have deprived the Quebec court of the ability
to determine the matter. The court was, however, able to avoid
the more difficult issue of conflicts between jurisdictions by
pointing to the fact that both jurisdictions are subject to the
overriding authority of the Supreme Court of Canada.<BR>
<P>
In <I>Lehndorff v. Gentra<SUP><A HREF="#99">99</A></SUP> </I>the same judge of the
Ontario Court General Division had a second occasion to deal with
parallel proceedings. As described above, Gentra had commenced
an action in Alberta to enforce on its security against a shopping
centre in response to which Lehndorff brought an action in Ontario
claiming that a certain compromise agreement had been breached.
The Ontario Court refused Gentra <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
motion to stay the Ontario action on the principles of <I>forum
non conveniens</I>. The Court concluded that having parallel proceedings
in Alberta and Ontario was not necessarily undesirable because
the decision of the first court would likely be binding on the
second.<BR>
<P>
Arguably, the courts should not be willing to accept parallel
proceedings. The danger is that they base outcomes on a race to
the quickest and not on any rational principles. To conclude that
the first decision would be binding on the second court, simply
means that the court system which operates the fastest will always
impose its juridical advantage on the parties even if they have
no reasonable expectations of enjoying it. This seems significantly
less principled than even the mechanical application of connecting
factors. An analysis of the reasonable expectations of the parties
and a decision based on them would, it is submitted, provide a
more principled basis for the resolution of the problem of parallel
proceedings created by requests for negative declarations. <BR>
<P>
VII. CONCLUSION<BR>
<!--VII.  CONCLUSION-->
<P>
This review of Anglo-Canadian law on forum shopping suggests that
courts have created needless difficulties by tying themselves
to legal tests developed for a different era. This has forced
courts at times to adopt strained logic in order to fit their
cases into older legal rules but still fulfill the reasonable
expectations of the parties. <BR>
<P>
The driving force behind most forum shopping is a desire to claim
a juridical advantage. In most cases, courts have failed to ask
why a party should even be entitled to a particular advantage.
The Supreme Court of Canada<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s
express link between juridical advantage and reasonable expectations
is a welcome development to providing a principled basis for analysing
a party<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s right to such
an advantage.<BR>
<P>
While juridical advantage is likely to remain the focus of most
forum shopping cases, reasonable expectations should be applied
to the overall determination of the appropriate forum and not
be restricted to the right to a juridical advantage. Personal
advantages or disadvantages should be decided on the same basis:
what reasonable expectation did a party have to claim the benefit
of a particular advantage?<BR>
<P>
The enforcement of reasonable expectations is a fundamental cornerstone
of most secular legal systems. As such, it is an approach which
is unlikely to create conflicts between jurisdictions. Indeed,
the enforcement of reasonable expectations inherently acknowledges
and enforces international comity by recognizing that the juridical
advantages or disadvantages of a particular forum are part of
a more complex series of trade-offs which ought to be respected.
A plaintiff ought not to be able to claim a juridical advantage
from a forum which does not correspond to the reasonable expectations
of the parties merely because the forum which does correspond
to those expectations denies him the advantage. That forum presumably
has good policy reasons for denying the advantage and will frequently
compensate for that denial in some other way. The use of reasonable
expectations analysis acknowledges and respects these differences
and recognizes that they are part of a more complex social contract
which the parties have helped shape. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>&quot;Monumental&quot; Decision Regarding Same
Sex Support Rights<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P></CENTER>
<B>December 19, 1996 - Toronto: </B>The Ontario Court of Appeal
released reasons December 18, 1996 upholding the trial court decision
in the case of <I>M</I> .v <I>H.</I> and held that same sex couples
should have the same support rights and obligations as married
or unmarried opposite sex couples. This constitutional decision
strikes out the requirement of section 29 of the Ontario <I>Family
Law Act</I> that spousal rights and obligations apply only to
opposite sex couples and extends the definition of &quot;spouse&quot;
to include any persons who have co-habited continuously for at
least 3 years. The three members of the Court of Appeal divided
2 to 1 on the issue. The majority judgment was written by Madam
Justice Charron, Mr. Justice David Doherty concurring; Mr. Justice
George Finlayson delivered a strong dissent. <BR>
<P>
The Court's declaration of constitutional invalidity has been
suspended for one year to give the Ontario government the opportunity
enact suitable amending legislation, failing which the effect
of this judgment will automatically come into force. This one
year period will also give persons in same sex relationships the
opportunity to arrange their own affairs in anticipation of the
legislative changes.<BR>
<P>
Lead counsel on this case was <A HREF="mailto:mmccarthy@mcbinch.com">Martha A. McCarthy</A> who practises
family law with McMillan Binch, assisted by a team of lawyers
and students in the preparation and presentation of the case.

<BR>
<P>
The annual report of the federal Auditor General released earlier
this year created a furor in Parliament and the media by disclosing
the substance of an advance income tax ruling issued in 1991 in
connection with the emigration of a personal trust and its sole
beneficiary. The report levelled criticisms both at the operation
of Revenue Canada's tax ruling process in that case and, more
importantly, the adoption by Revenue Canada of a statutory interpretation
that permitted assets to be transferred out of Canada in circumstances
where substantial capital gains tax was deferred and potentially
avoided entirely.  
<P>
In response, the House of Commons Finance Committee examined the
issues and prepared a report, and on October 2 the Minister of
Finance tabled a Notice of Ways and Means Motion in the House
of Commons proposing amendments to the <I>Income Tax Act </I>(Canada)
(the &quot;Act&quot;) that not only address the technical issues
raised by the Auditor General, but also, among other things, tighten
the application of the so-called &quot;departure tax&quot; rules.
These proposals will significantly affect the tax treatment of
persons who cease to be Canadian residents. The package also proposes
that persons ceasing to be resident in Canada at any time after
1995 provide a report listing each property they owned at the
time they ceased to be resident, subject to certain minimum thresholds
and exemptions. <BR>
<P>
<B><U>Departure Tax Exclusions</B></U>
<P>
The Minister proposes that there be a significant expansion of
the range of assets that are subject to the statutory deemed disposition
on ceasing to be resident in Canada.  Commencing October 2, 1996,
an individual will be deemed, prior to ceasing to be resident
in Canada, to have disposed of all of his or her property for
proceeds equal to its fair market value. This deemed disposition
will not apply to:
<UL>
<LI>real property situated in Canada
<LI>capital property used in, or property described in an inventory
of, a business carried on by the individual through a permanent
establishment in Canada immediately before that time,
<LI>a right to receive certain payments such as annuities and
rights under pensions, RRSPs and other deferred income arrangements
or a right to receive any payment of a benefit under the <I>Canada
Pension Plan</I> or a provincial pension plan,
<LI>where the individual is not a trust, and was resident in Canada
for a period or periods totalling not more than 60 months during
the 10 years immediately before emigration, property that was
owned by the individual at the time he or she last became a Canadian
resident or acquired by the individual by inheritance or bequest
after he or she last became a Canadian resident, and
<LI>a right to acquire shares of the capital stock of a corporation
where certain employee stock option rules would apply. 
</UL>
<P>
This amendment will have a dramatic effect on many individuals
considering emigration from Canada if these proposals are enacted
as currently proposed. Prior to October 2, the deemed disposition
did not apply to shares of private corporations, certain interests
in partnerships and Canadian-resident trusts, and a number of
other properties.
<P>
<B><U>Providing Security</B></U>
<P>
The proposals indicate that taxpayers will be permitted to provide
security acceptable to the Minister of National Revenue for the
payment of any tax liability that may arise as a result of a deemed
disposition described above. The background material released
by the Minister of Finance indicates that where the proposals
permit security to be provided in lieu of payment of tax, the
tax liability triggered by emigration will not bear interest.
It appears, therefore, that although the technical liability for
tax will be created at the time of the departure, there will be
no disincentive to delay payment until a subsequent sale or other
disposition occurs, apart from the cost of providing security.
In this fashion, the liability for tax will be crystallized before
the individual terminates Canadian residency and before any bilateral
income tax treaties come into play.   However, the actual collection
of the tax may be deferred. Because there is no interest cost
for taxpayers electing to provide security, the real effect of
the proposals in many cases will simply be to protect Canada's
ability to collect the taxes that were intended to be caught under
the prior rules. <BR>
<P>
<B><U>Planning Issues: Private Corporations</B></U>
<P>
The impact of the proposal is illustrated through the example
of an individual holding assets through a private corporation.
<P>
Until October 2, the individual could leave Canada without departure
tax in respect of the accrued gains on the shares or the accrued
gains or income attributable to the assets of the corporation.
If the former resident subsequently wished to draw assets from
the corporation, or wind it up, the tax consequences for both
the individual and the corporation would be determined at the
time of such a transaction. Typically, there would be recognition
of gains, income and losses in the corporation and withholding
tax on the distribution to the individual to the extent the amount
distributed exceeded any return of paid-up capital. A capital
gain would arise in the hands of the individual only if the transaction
involved a disposition of shares in circumstances where the paid-up
capital of the shares exceeded their adjusted cost base in the
hands of the individual. The application of Canadian deemed dividend
and capital gains rules would be subject to any reductions in
withholding tax rates or other relief available under any applicable
tax treaty between Canada and the former resident's new country
of residence.  The individual would of course, be subject to taxes
imposed by the new jurisdiction of residence, as well as the local
foreign tax credit rules.
<P>
The same individual holding such shares and now contemplating
emigration will have to deal with a mandatory deemed disposition
of the corporation's shares immediately before departure. The
potential for double tax may be significant, since tax triggered
before departure from Canada by the fair market value deemed disposition
will not necessarily give rise to foreign tax credits in the new
jurisdiction to shelter any local tax that may arise when the
underlying assets are eventually disposed of and distributed to
the individual. 
<P>
In any particular case the analysis may be difficult and subject
to Canadian and foreign uncertainties. On the Canadian side, the
deemed disposition will cause a step-up in the tax cost of the
shares and depending on the circumstances this may, on a future
disposition, give rise to a capital loss which in turn may be
available to reduce taxes on other capital gains in the year of
disposition or in other years, subject to loss carryover limitations.
<P>
Additional issues will arise in the new country of residence and
advisors there will have to be consulted to determine whether
the payment of current or deferred departure tax will qualify
for foreign tax credits in that country in the year of payment
(not necessarily a simple question since the actual liability
for tax will have arisen prior to departure).
<P>
Careful planning will be required to minimize these risks and
in certain cases taxpayers may be forced to change their emigration
plans or actually sell or wind-up their Canadian assets before
departure. For many, the prospect of an immediate sale or winding-up
may raise insurmountable liquidity problems. Unfortunately, there
is no suggestion that the right to defer tax and provide security
would extend to tax liabilities arising under other sections of
the Act even where such liabilities arise as a result of steps
taken in connection with departure planning.<BR>
<P>
<B><U>Asset Reporting</B></U> 
<P>
It appears the Department of Finance is becoming increasingly
enamoured of enhanced information reporting with respect to assets
owned by Canadian taxpayers. The February 27, 1995 Budget proposed
extensive new reporting requirements with respect to certain foreign
assets held by Canadian taxpayers and transactions involving foreign
corporations and trusts. Details of these reporting requirements
were released for public discussion on March 5, 1996 (and are
discussed in our March 12, 1996 Private Client Update). The October
2 proposals contain additional information reporting requirements.
<P>
Specifically, all individuals who cease at any time after 1995
to be Canadian residents and who own at that time property the
total fair market value of which is greater than $25,000 will
be required to provide a report in prescribed form listing each
property that they owned at that time (other than a personal-use
property _ e.g. residences and motor vehicles used primarily for
personal use or enjoyment _ that has a fair market value of less
than $10,000). <BR>
<P>
While such information reporting does not go to the heart of the
taxpayer's tax liabilities, such asset reporting represents a
significant departure from the manner in which the Canadian tax
system has applied to individuals since its inception. The Act
has required reporting of income, gains and dispositions of capital
property, but comprehensive reporting of assets owned by a taxpayer
has not been required of individuals. The February 1995 Budget
proposals and the October 2 proposals break with this tradition
and require individuals to report certain assets regardless of
whether or not such assets give rise to any income or loss, or
have been disposed of for the purposes of the Act.<BR>
<P>
<B><U>Concluding Observations</B></U>
<P>
The Minister of Finance has invited comments on the October 2
proposals. At present it is unclear whether any of the specific
proposals are likely to change in any material way. There is no
indication as to when draft legislation will be released or when
enactment of legislative proposals might be expected.
<P>
Regardless of any tinkering that may take place, it seems clear
that the departure tax rules will be substantially tightened.
Revenue losses arising from a variety of creative tax planning
opportunities will be curtailed. For many taxpayers considering
emigration, the potential burden of Canadian tax will become considerably
greater than it may have been up until October 2.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>THE ONTARIO SECURITIES COMMISSION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<I><B>This bulletin is for informational purposes only and summarizes
current developments and issues of interest in the field of finance
and insolvency law.  It does not offer legal advice.  Persons
requiring advice relating to matters discussed in this bulletin
should contact their professional advisors.<BR>
<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
<B>The Ontario Securities Commission (the </B>&quot;<B>Commission</B>&quot;<B>)
has released a proposed rule (the </B>&quot;<B>Rule</B>&quot;<B>)
accompanied by a statement of policy (the </B>&quot;<B>Policy</B>&quot;<B>)
regarding the regulation of over-the-counter (</B>&quot;<B>OTC</B>&quot;<B>)
derivatives in Ontario.  The purpose of the Rule is to remove
uncertainty as to the applicability of the<I> Securities Act</I>
(the </B>&quot;<B>Act</B>&quot;<B>) to OTC derivatives transactions.
 The new Rule will replace the draft ruling and policy statement
(the </B>&quot;<B>Draft Ruling</B>&quot;<B>) published by the
Commission in January, 1994.  Parties interested in making written
submissions with respect to the Rule and Policy must provide them
by March 3, 1997.  <BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Rule is substantially the same as the Draft Ruling except
for the following changes:  <BR>
<OL>
<LI type="i">The Commission has interpreted Bill 190 such that it permits
the Commission to regulate OTC derivatives without the need to
consider whether an OTC derivatives transaction constitutes a
trade in securities.<BR><BR>
<LI>The definition of qualified party has been expanded as
a result of comments received following the publication of the
Draft Ruling.<BR><BR>
<LI>The definition of OTC derivatives in the Rule has been
expanded by eliminating the narrow list of underlying interests
to which a financial contract must be tied.  The Rule, therefore,
applies to all OTC derivatives transactions regardless of the
nature or type of its underlying interests.<BR><BR>
<LI>Under the Rule, all specified commodity derivatives transactions
involving only qualified parties are exempt transactions, regardless
of whether the purpose of the derivatives transaction is for risk
management or hedging.  Specified commodity is defined to include,
among other categories, grains, metals, oils, exotics (such as
electricity/pollutant emission) along with any other derivatives
designated by the Commission from time to time. </B>
</OL>
<P>
<P>
<B>The definitions determine the applicability of the Rule and,
arguably, are its most important aspect.  OTC derivatives means
an option, a forward contract or a contract for differences in
which the material terms of the agreement must be customized for
the purposes of the user, the instrument must not be entered into
or traded on an organized exchange and the creditworthiness of
a party must be an important factor in deciding the terms of the
instrument or whether to enter into the agreement.  The Policy
confirms that master agreements, such as the ISDA master agreement,
would not be considered standardized agreements.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Another determinative issue concerning the application of the
Act is whether the parties to an OTC derivatives transaction fit
within the definition of qualified party (</B>&quot;<B>Qualified
Party</B>&quot;<B>).  An appendix to the Rule lists numerous entities
including financial institutions, governments, funds, brokers/dealers,
charities, commercial users, certain individuals and other sophisticated
parties, each of which is a Qualified Party under the Rule.  It
is important to note that according to the Policy, a party is
able to rely on the representations made by a counterparty that
it is a Qualified Party.  (For more detailed descriptions of Qualified
Parties, please see Appendix A attached). <BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Rule establishes three categories of OTC derivatives transactions,
each of which is subject to differing degrees of regulation under
the Act<I>.</I>  The first category consists of the following
OTC derivatives transactions which will be exempt from the application
of the Act (</B>&quot;<B>Exempt Transactions</B>&quot;<B>):<BR>

<OL>
<LI type="i">an interest rate/foreign exchange derivatives transaction
where each party is a Qualified Party or a party entering the
transaction for OTC derivatives hedging purposes, or<BR><BR>
<LI>specified commodity derivatives where all parties are Qualified
Parties.  </B>
</OL>
<P>
<P>
<B>The Commission is satisfied that Exempt Transactions do not
require regulation because of the sophistication of the parties
and because of the nature of the transactions.  <BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Transactions which are not Exempt Transactions are afforded
unconditional prospectus and registration exemptions if each party
to the transaction is a Qualified Party (</B>&quot;<B>Qualified
Party Transactions</B>&quot;<B>).  It should be noted that unlike
Exempt Transactions, Qualified Party Transactions are subject
to other aspects of the Act such as insider trading rules.  <BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The third category consists of all other OTC derivatives transactions
(</B>&quot;<B>Other Transactions</B>&quot;<B>).  The Commission
is of the view that parties other than Qualified Parties do require
the protection offered under the Act.  For Other Transactions
to be exempt from the registration and prospectus requirements
of the Act, the non-Qualified Party must have entered into the
transaction through an OTC derivatives dealer and must have been
given a generic risk disclosure statement in the form set out
in Appendix B of the Rule.  The statement is intended to educate
the counterparty about the risks posed by OTC derivatives.  The
risks discussed include credit, currency, leveraging and other
factors.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Like Qualified Party Transactions, Other Transactions, which
may be exempt from the prospectus and registration requirements
of the Act because the parties have complied with this Rule, remain
subject to the Act</B>'<B>s other components such as insider trading
rules.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Policy makes clear that parties whose transactions do not
fit within the exemptions provided under the Rule continue to
be able to make use of the prospectus and registration exemptions
in the Act.  The Policy also clarifies that the $150,000 exemption
can only be used in OTC derivatives transactions where the $150,000
is a premium or purchase price.  The exemption cannot be used
where it is only the underlying interest that exceeds $150,000.
 Therefore, the $150,000 exemption would not normally be available
for swaps, forwards and other such transactions.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>It should also be noted that where an exemption under the Act
which requires the filing of a Form 20 is relied on in an OTC
derivatives transaction, a Form 20 must be filed with the Commission
and the requisite fee paid within ten days of the closing of the
transaction.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>For more information on the draft Rule and Policy please contact
Gary Ostoich (865-7802), Scott Hyman (865-7912), Richard Higa
(865-7864) or Tim Baron (865-7096).<BR>

<P>
<B>DEFINITION OF QUALIFIED PARTY<BR>

<P>
A recent decision of the Ontario Court<A HREF="#footnote" ><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT></A></SUP>
concerning derivatives transactions may have a subtle, yet important,
impact on ISDA documented derivatives transactions. The case concerned
an attempt by Citibank Canada to set off amounts owing from The
Confederation Life Insurance Company and Confederation Treasury
Services Limited under swap agreements and a bond option agreement
against an unrelated bank deposit they held on behalf of Confederation
Life. As a result of Confederation Life encountering severe financial
difficulties and subsequently entering the process of being wound
up, Citibank treated the swap transactions as having been terminated.
Citibank claimed an amount owing under the swap transactions based
on the &quot;market quotation&quot; formula provided in a standard
ISDA master agreement. Justice Blair, speaking for the court,
held that Citibank was not entitled to succeed in law or in equity
in its efforts to set off the bond option agreement and swap transaction
claims against the amount owing to Confederation Life under the
deposit.<BR>
<P>
The court stated that the claim did not meet the test for legal
set-off because the claims under the swap transactions were not
&quot;debts&quot; in the context they were put forward nor were
they &quot;liquidated&quot; debts at the date of the commencement
of the winding up proceedings with respect to Confederation Life.
The court focused on Citibank's contention that they were entitled
to go into the market in order to re-establish the positions that
had been lost as a result of the termination of the swap transactions.
In the court's opinion, these claims sounded in damages and the
fact that the parties had provided a formula for determining such
damages did not alter the nature of the claim. As a result, the
court held that Confederation Life's obligation to reimburse Citibank
for the cost of replacing the swap transactions gave rise to a
claim for damages, not a liquidated debt. <BR>
<P>
The court also rejected a claim for equitable set-off since the
cross claims were not &quot;connected or interrelated in some
manner which would make it unjust to permit one party to enforce
payment without accounting for the existence of the other claim.&quot;
The court noted that the deposit transaction had been entered
into at a different time and for a different purpose than the
swap agreements and option agreement. As a result of the swap
transactions having been entered into separately with no connecting
link, the court held that equitable set-off.<BR>
<P>
This case underscores the limits that may be placed on the ability
of a counterparty to set-off in insolvency proceedings claims
arising from derivatives transactions against other claims arising
from unrelated agreements that the parties may have entered into.
As a result of this case, unless appealed successfully, counterparties
to derivatives transactions should consider and review contractual
rights of set-off included in existing derivatives transaction
documentation to determine what effect, if any, those additional
rights would have with respect to other dealings between counterparties
to transactions.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Rules for Properly Using Your Trade-Marks<BR></CENTER>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Protecting a valuable trade&#173;mark requires more than just
registering it. Whether or not you register your trade&#173;mark,
you should observe the following 7 main rules for correct trade&#173;mark
use in Canada: 
<P>
1. Use your trade&#173;mark as an adjective
<P>
2. Emphasize your trade&#173;mark in such a way that it is readily
distinguishable from any accompanying text
<P>
3. Do not vary your trade&#173;mark in any way
<P>
4. Use a trade&#173;mark notice
<P>
5. Continue to use your trade&#173;mark
<P>
6. Be careful about authorized use by third parties, and
<P>
7. Be vigilant with respect to unauthorized use by third parties
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>1. Use your trade&#173;mark as an Adjective</B></I>
<P>
It has been said that, &quot;Proper trade&#173;mark use would
be automatic if we would remember that a trade&#173;mark is an
adjective and not a noun&quot;. Trade&#173;marks should never
be used as nouns, verbs, possessives or in the plural. A trade&#173;mark
identifies a particular brand of a product. It is not the name
of the product. The public must recognize the trade&#173;mark,
not as an identification of the product alone, but as the identification
of a particular manufacturer's version of that product.
<P>
Since a trade&#173;mark is an adjective there must be a noun for
it to modify. That noun is the generic name of the product. For
example, in the case of the trade&#173;mark HIDE&#173;A&#173;BED,
you should not say &quot;Sleep well on your HIDE&#173;A&#173;BED&quot;.
Instead, you should say &quot;Sleep well on your HIDE&#173;A&#173;BED
convertible sofa&quot;.
<P>
If a trade&#173;mark is used as a noun and the public uses it
as the name of the product in question, then it ceases to be a
trade&#173;mark and the trade&#173;mark is said to have become
a &quot;generic&quot; term. That means the term is available for
anyone to use and that the owner has lost all of its exclusive
rights. Aspirin, thermos, cellophane and escalator are all common
descriptive names which at one time were trade&#173;marks in the
United States but lost that status because they were used as nouns.
When a trade&#173;mark is lost by conversion into a generic term
it is often the manufacturer's own advertising or labelling which
is at fault.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>2. Emphasize your trade&#173;mark</B></I>
<P>
Your trade&#173;mark should be emphasized or given &quot;special
treatment&quot; so that it is easily distinguishable from any
accompanying text. 
<P>
It is a good idea to display a trade&#173;mark entirely in capital
letters. However if a trade&#173;mark is used in copy which is
itself all in capital letters, then it is advisable to display
the trade&#173;mark in bolder face type, to underline it or to
put it in quotation marks or in larger size letters or in a different
colour so that it stands out. Several of these techniques may
be used together.
<P>
The objective is to emphasize the trade&#173;mark. Naturally the
common descriptive name of the product or service should not receive
the special treatment given to the trade&#173;mark.
<BR><P>
<I><B>3. Do not vary your trade&#173;mark</B></I>
<P>
You should not change the spelling of a word mark in even a minor
way. For example, you should not add or delete a hyphen. Similarly,
if your trade&#173;mark consists of two separate words then the
words should not be combined. The converse is also true. Your
trade&#173;mark should never be abbreviated. Your trade&#173;mark
should not be broken at the end of a line of print. 
<P>
You should never coin any other word from a trade&#173;mark, either
by changing the spelling of a trade&#173;mark or by adding a prefix
or a suffix to it, whether with or without a hyphen, or by any
other method.
<P>
You should use a design mark (a logo) in exactly the form in which
it was registered. For example, a design should not be reversed.
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>4. Use a trade&#173;mark notice</B></I>
<P>
You should indicate in advertising and labelling that your trade&#173;mark
is registered or, if it is not, that you regard it as being a
trade&#173;mark and that you claim exclusive rights to the mark.
<P>
In the case of a <I>registered</I> trade&#173;mark it is common
practice to employ the symbol 7 in close proximity to the trade&#173;mark
in at least one place in the text. It is also recommended that
you use a legend such as &quot;XYZ is a registered trade&#173;mark
of ABC Corporation&quot;. As an alternative to an 7 placed near
the trade&#173;mark, an asterisk may be placed near the trade&#173;mark
and then the legend in the form &quot;*XYZ is a registered trade&#173;mark
of ABC Corporation&quot; may be used somewhere else on the ad
copy or packaging.
<P>
In the case of a trade&#173;mark that has <I>not been registered,</I>
instead of the 7 symbol the letters TM may be used, whether or
not an application to register the trade&#173;mark has been filed.
In that case the legend should read: &quot;XYZ is a trade&#173;mark
of ABC Corporation&quot;.
<P>
In the case of a trade&#173;mark used in Canada under licence
from the trade&#173;mark owner, there should be a written licence
agreement between the parties. When there is a licence arrangement
in place the notice could read: &quot;XYZ is a registered trade&#173;mark
of ABC Corporation, used under licence&quot;.
<P>
Pursuant to recent amendments to the Trade&#173;marks Act in Canada,
if public notice is given of the identity of the trade&#173;mark
owner, and the fact that the use is under licence, then the use
by the licensee will be presumed to be under the control of the
trade&#173;mark owner. Public notice is not defined in the Trade&#173;marks
Act but presumably means notice which is made apparent to the
public, such as notices on labels and in advertising. You will
note that the Act does not require that the name of the licensee
be given, although the licensee's name would often appear for
other reasons &#173; for example, to comply with packaging and
labelling laws.
<P>
If your copy or packaging contains the same trade&#173;mark several
times, such as might occur in a brochure, you need to use the
legend only once, preferably on the page on which the trade&#173;mark
first appears.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>5. Continue to use your trade&#173;mark</B></I>
<P>
It is a basic principle of trade&#173;mark law in Canada that
an owner which stops using its trade&#173;mark loses its rights
in that trade&#173;mark.
<P>
Most often a company which owns a trade&#173;mark which it has
stopped using will lose its rights in that trade&#173;mark as
a result of proceedings initiated by an interested party (usually
a competitor). A competitor may initiate these proceedings because
it wishes to register the same or a similar mark and the presence
on the Trade&#173;marks Register of the trade&#173;mark which
is no longer in use is blocking its application in the Trade&#173;marks
Office.
<P>
Pursuant to the <I>Trade&#173;marks Act</I>, a party which suspects
that a trade&#173;mark is not in use may, after 3 years from the
date of registration of the trade&#173;mark, pay a prescribed
fee and request the Registrar to issue a notice to the owner of
the mark requiring that company to file within 3 months an affidavit
or statutory declaration showing, with respect to each of the
wares or services specified in the registration, whether the trade&#173;mark
is in use in Canada and, if not, the date when it was last so
in use and the reason for the absence of use since that date.
<P>
Unless the Registrar regards this request as frivolous, or a similar
Notice has recently been issued against the same trade&#173;mark
or similar proceedings are already in progress against that trade&#173;mark,
the Registrar will issue the Notice. There is then a set procedure
which is followed. The registrant files an affidavit showing that
its trade&#173;mark was in use at any time during the 2&#173;year
period immediately preceding the date of the notice or that there
are special circumstances that excuse the absence of use, the
requesting party makes a submission, the registrant replies, a
hearing is held and the Registrar makes his decision.
<P>
It should be noted that an affidavit which simply recites that
a trade&#173;mark was in use at any time during the 2&#173;year
period immediately preceding the date of the notice is not satisfactory.
The affidavit must establish sales of the product or providing
of the services in the ordinary course of business and have attached
to it sample labels, letterhead and so on so that the Registrar
is in a position to make his own determination that the trade&#173;mark
was, in fact, being used in the ordinary course of business at
some point during the 2&#173;year period immediately preceding
the date of the notice.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>6. Be careful about authorized use by third parties</B></I>
<P>
It is important that an infringer who is confronted with your
trade&#173;mark owner's rights should not be able to establish
that you are not entitled to exclusive rights in the trade&#173;mark.
<P>
While there are a number of ways in which your trade&#173;mark
rights may be lost, one of the most common of these is the use
of the same or a confusing trade&#173;mark or trade&#173;name
by an entity other than you when such use is not controlled by
you through an appropriate license arrangement. Trade&#173;mark
rights may be lost through either deliberate or inadvertent concurrent
use by parties other than the owner of the trade&#173;mark.
<P>
In Canada, a trade&#173;mark will not be valid if it is used in
Canada by any company other than its owner or by more than one
company unless each company (other than the owner of the mark)
using the mark is licensed by or with the authority of the owner
of the trade&#173;mark to use the trade&#173;mark and the owner
has, under the licence, direct or indirect control of the character
or quality of the wares or services.
<P>
As a trade&#173;mark owner, you should not assume that you have
no responsibilities other than ensuring that a written licence
agreement is in place. Instead, you should take steps to put yourself
in a position where you can establish that you actually do control
the character and quality of the goods and/or services. It would
be wise for you to make periodic inspections of premises, goods,
written materials displaying the trade&#173;mark, advertisements
etc., so that you can demonstrate actual control of the goods
sold and services performed under licence.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>7. Be vigilant about unauthorized use by third parties</B></I>
<P>
The Trade&#173;marks Act gives you, as the owner of a registered
trade&#173;mark, the exclusive right to the use throughout Canada
of the trade&#173;mark in respect of the wares or services covered
by the registration. As well, design trade&#173;marks can often
be protected under copyright law. It should be noted that the
product or service in association with which the third party mark
is used (for example a T&#173;shirt or mug) doesn't necessarily
have to be a product or service which you sell in association
with your trade&#173;mark before liability for trade&#173;mark
or copyright infringement will be found.
<P>
If you do nothing which will damage your trade&#173;mark, that
is half the battle. However, the other half is to ensure that
your trade&#173;mark is not damaged by the activities of others.
Education is needed to prevent innocent misuse. Aggressive legal
action is required to stop intentional misuse.<BR>

<P>
If third parties use the same or a similar trade&#173;mark in
association with the same or similar goods and you do not use
your legal rights to stop them, then eventually your rights in
your trade&#173;mark may be lost because the public won't be receiving
a clear message as to the source of the goods. For that reason,
it is important to watch the marketplace for any use of confusing
marks and to pursue such problems.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
When you properly use and maintain your trade&#173;mark, you have
the exclusive right to use it on and in connection with products
or services of the type that it identifies, and this right will
be protected by law indefinitely so long as the trade&#173;mark
remains in use and is used properly and the registration is kept
in force. Since trade&#173;marks are very valuable assets it is
well worth the effort to take all the steps which are necessary
to maintain them as a valuable marketing tool.<BR>

<P>
Over the past few years, major studies in the US, UK, Canada and
South Africa have come to remarkably similar conclusions on the
issue of separating the roles of CEO and Chairman.  Each study
looked specifically at corporate governance, and each identified
the separation of the roles and responsibilities of the Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer as a key factor in promoting effective
corporate governance.<BR>

<P>
If the advice to divide the functions is easily stated, it is
harder to implement.  How exactly are the new Chairman and the
Chief Executive to work together?  What are the safeguards against
the Chairman assuming so many of the Chief Executive's
roles as to weaken his or her authority?  What balance of responsibility
is appropriate?<BR>

<P>
Despite such challenges, corporations and boards which think through
these issues carefully cannot fail to improve their corporate
governance awareness, no matter what the outcome.  The right outcome
will also yield increased business effectiveness.<BR>

<P>
To help them in this process, this article provides a set of practical
guidelines on how to deal, on a day-to-day basis, with the separation
of functions.<BR>

<P>
In approaching the question of separating these functions, it
must always be borne in mind that they oversee.   This means that
there is no single right answer as boards and corporation grapple
with this issue.  As the recent Toronto Stock Exchange Committee
Report on Corporate Governance noted, there are 'many
roads to Rome'.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Trends on both side of the Atlantic<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
In England, the report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects
of Corporate Governance (the Cadbury Report) was issued in December
1992 with the Financial Reporting Council announcing a follow-up
study in June 1995.  The Cadbury Report was unequivocal -- there
should be a 'clearly
accepted division of responsibilities at the head of a company,
which will ensure a balance of power and authority, such that
no individual has unfettered powers of decision'.
 This follows the standard English practice where the Chief Executive's
position and Chair's
position are historically held by two individuals.  In some English
corporations, this model has been taken as far as making the Chairman
responsible for all outside communications.  Thus, the Chairman
would be responsible for meeting with significant investors, communicating
with government and the media, and presenting the public profile
of the corporation.<BR>

<P>
In South Africa developments have been similar.  The Institute
of Directors in Southern Africa formed the King Committee in 1994
to look into corporate governance reform, financial oversight,
and developing a code of ethical practice for business.  In addition
to recommending a balance between management and outside directors,
the Report recommends that corporations be chaired by outside
directors unless the Board considers that this will not be in
the corporation's best
interests.<BR>

<P>
In Canada, the TSE Committee Report on Corporate Governance of
December 1994, stopped just short of mandating a split between
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, although the Committee expressed
strong preference for such a separation.  Because all companies
listed on the largest Canadian Stock Exchange are now required
to report on how far their corporate governance practices conform
to the TSE recommendations.  The largest Canadian companies are
now faced squarely with the split Chair/CEO issue as an immediate
agenda item.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>A Changing North American Model<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
If the separate roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive can
be said to have been the English model, in North America, the
model of a single strong person combining both roles has tended
to prevail.  Until recently, more than 80 percent of major public
corporations in North America followed this pattern.  But this
is changing and the currently held view in an increasing number
of senior corporate governance circles strongly favours a separation
of roles.  A number of major corporations are taking this tack.
 General Motors, TWA and Morrison Knudsen have each split off
the Chairman's role
from that of the CEO.<BR>

<P>
The most recent Korn/Ferry International Board of Directors survey
shows that in 23 percent of North America's
major corporations, the roles are already split, with a further
10 percent having the split issue on the board's
working agenda.<BR>

<P>
In the United States, while there has been less consideration
of the issues by institutional studies such as the Cadbury Report
or the TSE Report, there has been strong support for the idea
in the business press, from shareholder activists and from professional
and academic commentators.  Most notably in May 1994, General
Motors unveiled a 'Magna
Carta' for directors,
which argue that board power should be vested primarily in the
board's non-executive
directors, rather than in management.  In reflection of this deliberate
shift in power, it was felt that the group's
Chief Executive Officer should not have plenary powers over the
board.<BR>

<P>
The GM Guidelines recommended a separation of the Chairman's
position from that of Chief Executive Officer, in order to maintain
board independence from management.  Following the GM lead, major
corporations across the world are re-evaluating governance structures,
many of them by reference to the GM Guidelines and all considering
whether the company's
corporate governance would be strengthened by a separation of
powers at top levels.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Lack of precedents in North America<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
In North America, few precedents exist to guide corporations making
the split.  This is likely because the benefits of separating
the Chairman's and Chief
Executive responsibilities have only been recognised relatively
recently as the corporate governance debate has intensified over
the past decade.  It will be important for all involved to come
to terms with their respective roles and responsibilities, and
for due consideration to be given to planning for change.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Legal and business principles to be applied<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
It is fundamental that any division of responsibilities between
Chairman and Chief Executive must respect both the legal and pragmatic
requirements of corporate governance.  In the common law jurisdictions
the board is responsible under law for the management of the corporation
(in the sense of overseeing management) and answers to its shareholders.
 This, it is management's
role to manage, while the board's
job is to ensure there is good management.  This points to the
vital distinction between the two jobs:<BR>

<P>
<UL><LI> the Chairman and the board is chosen by and is accountable to
the board.  His job is to run the business of the board, not to
run the company;<BR>
<BR><BR>
<LI> the board delegates to management the authority to run the company's
business.  The Chief Executive's
job is to do just that, but not the business of the board, which
oversees him and his management team;<BR>

<BR><BR><LI>
 the Chief Executive is appoint by and reports to the board.
<BR>
</UL>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Decision to separate the function -- what to do?
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
In our experience, when a decision is made to split the functions,
it is helpful for the Chairman and Chief Executive to meet formally
to discuss a workable division of responsibilities, possibly assisted
by a neutral experienced advisor.  Such discussions should be
designed to lead to job descriptions and a corporate protocol
defining respective responsibilities and patterns of interaction.
 At the very least, the participants will gain an understanding
of the boundaries of their roles.  If documents do result from
the discussions -- and they should -- they should be discussed
with and eventually approved by the board, with Chairman and Chief
Executive accepting responsibility to be so bound.<BR>

<P>
It is the key to the process that the separation of the two roles
does not undermine the Chief Executive's
day-to-day authority over the company's
business or lead to uncertainty of roles for either Chairman or
Chief Executive.  Equally, the Chief Executive must come away
with an understanding of the limits of his or her role and of
the reality of the Chairman's
responsibilities.<BR>

<P>
The topics discussed below will provide useful heads for the agenda
of the suggested meetings.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Chief Executive's
roles<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
In every sense the Chief Executive runs the corporation.  He is
ultimately responsible for every detail of its day-to-day operation.
 Accordingly, it would be a vast task to list the working responsibilities
of any particular Chief Executive, let alone to generalise from
the itemised responsibilities of particular individuals.<BR>

<P>
Instead, the proper functioning of the Chief Executive can best
be shown by highlighting those roles which we suggest should be
more properly the responsibilities of the Chairman.  A number
of these responsibilities are much easier to carry out if a different
individual holds the Chairman's
job.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Chairman's
roles</FONT></B>
<P>
<I><B>Representing the Corporation<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
One question to be addressed is how far the Chairman's
role should be extended beyond the Board's
business, and chairing shareholder's
meetings, to present a public face to the corporation.  In England,
for example, it is common for a non-executive Chairman to take
on the role of corporate spokesman to broadly based constituencies
such as the general public, the financial community, employees,
government and the like.<BR>

<P>
While this division of responsibilities has apparently worked
well in the business culture of the UK, it is likely to be problematic
in North America.  In the United States and Canada, this aspect
of the UK approach would run the risk of diminishing the effectiveness
of a chief executive's
management, and weakening management must be avoided at all costs.
<BR>

<P>
This means the chief executive should be spokesman for the company,
in charge of its day-to-day operations and its dealings with all
outsiders.  It also implies that the Chairman's
external role will be limited to public visibility at the annual
meeting, where it is strictly necessary for the Chairman to carry
out his or her duty of running the business of the board, or where
he or she acts at the express request of the chief executive.
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Making sure that information flows<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
To run the business of the board, the Chairman must never be surprised
by developments in the company's
business or operations.  This suggests intimate, ongoing dealings
between the Chief Executive and the Chairman.  In some cases,
this may mean daily communications by telephone.  In all cases,
such informed discussions must be supplemented by agreed information
flows and briefings.<BR>

<P>
The Chairman, as with any member of the board, needs relatively
open access to senior management but absent extraordinary circumstances
this access should tend to be exercised at the request -- or with
the knowledge of -- the Chief Executive; to do otherwise could
be destabilising.  This means a Chairman should not, except in
extraordinary circumstances, have direct dealings with senior
management behind the back of the Chief Executive.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Meetings of the board<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
Since it is the Chairman's
job to run the business of the board, the form and substance of
board meetings are his responsibility.  The Chairman should set
the board agenda.  This is pivotal to splitting the two roles
-- a CEO who also acts as Chairman can avoid issues, simply by
keeping them off the agenda.<BR>

<P>
The Chairman must ensure that the board agenda is properly paced,
with an appropriate split between strategy and monitoring how
successful management has been in achieving that strategy.  The
board should previously have set benchmarks against which to measure
whether objectives have been met.<BR>

<P>
All of this suggests that a properly functioning Chairman/Chief
Executive partnership will imply that there will always be discussions
(and probably meetings) concerning the nature, process and content
of board meetings including the quality, nature and timing of
information flow to the board in advance of scheduled meetings.
 The Chairman should also participate in dress rehearsals of board
and annual meetings, which should be held sufficiently in advance
of such meetings to permit necessary changes.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Assessing management<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
The board must establish an effective management review process.
 Given the board's responsibility
to ensure that the corporation has good management, an attentive
Chairman will want to ensure that the board spends appropriate
time in assessing and determining what management should accomplish
over time.  This will require detailed interaction between the
Chairman and Chief Executive.  Once the board has determined what
management needs to accomplish and sets a time frame, it will
be responsible, under the Chairman's
leadership, for establishing benchmarks against which management's
success in achieving its agreed objectives can be measured.<BR>

<P>
The Chairman and Chief Executive may also wish to agree on the
selection of senior management to attend at board meetings, to
serve as 'resource
persons', available
to the Chief Executive to help him give board members a better
working knowledge of the Corporation's
operations.  Management, including the Chief Executive, would
be excluded when the board moved into an in camera session, which
many corporations are scheduling one or two times a year.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Planning for succession: keeping the board fresh<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
The Chairman has key responsibility for ensuring appropriate succession
planning.  In addition to planning the succession of the Chief
Executive, he will also have the responsibility of facilitating
and ensuring an appropriate succession process for board membership
and, in particular, the Chairmanship.  Consideration should be
given to establishing a formal procedure (perhaps involving outside
directors only) for the appointment of the next Chairman.<BR>

<P>
The Chairman, and not the Chief Executive, should manage the process
for the search and selection of directors for the board. A necessary
part of this process will involve consideration of the terms of
appointment of board members, and how the board can be kept fresh.
 To ensure that the board does not become stale, it may be necessary
to consider limits on service or the mandatory submission of resignation
by any board member who retires from or changes current external
responsibilities, where the holding of that responsibility has
been a consideration in his initial appointment to the board.
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Splitting the top jobs -- fix or fad<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Proposals to split the functions of Chief Executive and Chairman
have come from many quarters in recent years, with the increasing
focus on Corporate Governance Reform.  In North America, the pattern
of a single unified leadership has prevailed for so long that
some question whether splitting the top jobs is a fad or a fix,
whether the split is truly likely to yield long term benefits
to the functioning of the Board and the overall welfare of the
Corporation.<BR>

<P>
In a recent New York Times article on the subject, splitting the
roles was described as a transitional or temporary remedy for
Corporations with serious structural or financial problems.  The
examples of American Express and K-Mart which quickly reunited
the posts of Chief Executive and Chairman once they had gone through
business crises, were identified.<BR>

<P>
For our part, we believe that North American corporations have
for too long been enthralled with the concept of the single military
leader, unchallenged in his or her management of the corporation.
 The increasing demands of institutional investors and other stakeholders
has fuelled the corporate governance movement.  The belief is
now widespread that there is value in splitting the roles, and
that this reinforces the proper and effective functioning of the
Board.  At General Motors, splitting the top jobs was not -- and
is not seen as -- a fad.  In this, General Motors is clearly showing
the way.  And, as many say, what is good for General Motors is
good for America -- and beyond.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>A Chairman's
Checklist</FONT></B>
<P>
<I><B>Expectations of Chairmen Under the New Model of Corporate
Governance?<BR>
</B></I>
<UL><LI> The Chairman's principal
role is to lead the board in the conduct of its business.  In
today's context an effective
board will be a strong and independent board capable of fulfilling
its corporate, legal and fiduciary duties and responsibilities.
<BR>
<BR><LI> The Chairman must provide leadership to the boards.  A board
will only be as effective as its Chairman wants it to be or is
capable of making it.

<BR><BR><LI> If the Chairman's
and Chief Executive's
roles are separated, each must work with the other with understanding
and respect.  Their separate roles and responsibilities -- running
the board and running the company respectively -- must be tightly
coordinated.  But it should go without saying that the Chairman
(and indeed other board members) must resist the temptation to
become involved in operational management.

<BR><BR><LI> The Chairman is not the Chief Executive's
boss; the board has that responsibility.  However, as a matter
of practice the Chairman is the board member who has the most
direct and intimate contact with the Chief Executive, who in turn
will coordinate his activities and have day-to-day communications
and dealings with the Chairman.

<BR><BR><LI> The Chairman presides over the board's
deliberations and controls their substance.  He must ensure all
relevant and material issues surface at the board level in a timely
manner.

<BR><BR><LI> The Chairman will need to ensure the effective functioning of
the board's sub-committees.
 He should review board committee membership with the full board,
and meet regularly with all board committee Chairman.  He should
see that committees have proper terms of reference and are suitably
and adequately peopled by non-executive directors, with management
present to provide necessary background information and support,
and to carry out any instructions or projects such as additional
research.<BR>

<BR><LI> The Chairman must ensure that there is good information flow
among directors, managers and shareholders.<BR>

<BR><LI> The Chairman must play a leadership role in assessing the board's
performance.  This could perhaps be done by leading the nominating
committee.

<CENTER><H2>Canadian and U.S. "Cuba" Laws:<BR> 
	The Risks of Getting Caught in the Crossfire </H2></CENTER>

<P><DD>		U.S. "Cuba" laws and Canadian countermeasures have created a high risk situation for Canadian companies in general, and for the Canadian subsidiaries of U.S. parents, in particular.  The point-counterpoint escalation of U.S. and Canadian measures relating to trade with Cuba has put many businesses in an almost impossible position where compliance with one country's laws will constitute a violation of the other country's laws.  </P>

<P><DD>		While this conflict can provide interesting insights into the role that foreign policy plays in U.S. trade policy, and brings to the surface long-standing Canadian sensitivities concerning the extraterritorial application of U.S. laws, the practical truth is that it is the members of the Canadian and U.S. business communities that are likely to pay for the politics, as both countries will likely be looking to strict enforcement in order to show constituents that their laws have teeth.   

<P><DD>		While there still are some ways for businesses to legally structure their transactions and communications to avoid getting caught in this crossfire, recent amendments to both countries' laws have narrowed the range of planning possibilities and significantly increased the risk of exposure.

<P><B>THE U.S. LEGISLATION</B>

<P><DD>		The prohibitions and restrictions in the <I>Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 </I>and the <I>Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (Libertad) Act of 1995 ("Helms-Burton")</I>, expose Canadian companies that carry on business in or with Cuba to liability in the U.S.  The <I>Cuban Democracy Act</I>, re-affirmed by <I>Helms-Burton</I>, prohibits trade between Cuba and the Canadian subsidiaries of U.S. corporations, and provides civil penalties for violations, including fines and the forfeiture of property. <I> Helms-Burton</I> also urges the full enforcement of the <I>Cuban Assets Control Regulations</I> which permit the blacklisting of Canadians who enter into joint ventures with Cuban companies, and the <I>Trading with the Enemy Act</I>, which also provides for criminal and civil penalties.</P>

<P><DD>		<I>Helms-Burton</I> gives U.S. citizens with claims to Cuban property confiscated by the Castro regime the right to sue any person or entity that traffics in confiscated property.  "Traffic" is broadly defined to encompass most business activities involving confiscated property such as carrying on business on confiscated lands.  Treble damages are available where the defendant had prior notice of the ownership claim.  There is, however, no possibility that Canadian courts would allow any such judgment to be enforced against assets in Canada. 

<P><I>Helms-Burton</I> also directs the U.S. government to deny entry to a non-U.S. citizen and his or her spouse, minor child or agent, if the non-U.S. citizen converts or  traffics in confiscated property or is an officer, principal or controlling shareholder of an entity that converts or traffics in confiscated property.

<P><B>CANADIAN LEGISLATION</B>

<P><DD>		Canada's <I>Foreign Extraterritorial Measures (United States) Order, 1992</I> was issued to stop Canadian businesses from complying with the 1992 <I>Cuban Democracy Act</I>.  Under the Order, Canadian corporations are required to report in detail to the Attorney General any directive, intimation of policy or other communication ("foreign directive") received from a person in a position to direct or influence the policies of the Canadian corporation with respect to a U.S. measure involving trade with Cuba.  The Order also prohibits compliance, by act or omission, with any such foreign directive even if compliance was not the only reason for the act or omission.  Therefore, a Canadian company that terminates trade with Cuba for various reasons, only one of which may have been compliance with a foreign directive, risks violating the Order and being exposed to criminal penalties.

<P><DD>		The Order was recently amended to broaden its scope.  It now applies to trade in services and technology, as well as in goods; covers any future U.S. laws, as well as existing laws; expands the definition of "trade or commerce between Canada and Cuba"; encompasses virtually all business entities, as well as their directors, officers, managers and senior employees; and requires that the Attorney General be notified "forthwith" upon the receipt of a foreign directive.

<P><B>CONCERNS</B>

<P><DD>		While Canadian-owned businesses are not likely to be exposed to the "foreign directive" liability in the Canadian Order, their U.S. subsidiaries remain at risk under U.S. laws if the related companies continue to do business with Cuba.  Those at highest risk under the Canadian law are U.S. owned or foreign-owned Canadian subsidiaries where the parent is not aware of the Canadian countermeasures.  For example, a typical scenario would be for a U.S. parent's corporate counsel to tell its international affiliates that dealings with Cuba would expose the parent to U.S. liabilities and direct that all such dealings should cease. This, of course, would run directly contrary to the Canadian Order, and require not only that the subsidiary report the receipt of the communication to Ottawa, but presumably also notify the parent of its refusal to comply with the directive.  That kind of reply might in turn be treated as evidence that exposed the parent to liabilities under the U.S. laws.</P>

<P><DD>		Canadian businesses must now also account for <I>Helms-Burton</I> lawsuits by U.S. citizens in U.S. courts.  Given the political sensitivity of the issue, the large Cuban expatriate population and that country's aggressive plaintiff bar, Canadian entities carrying on business in Cuba that have assets in the U.S. will be at substantial risk.  Furthermore, Canadian citizens who are officers, principals, or controlling shareholders of Canadian businesses may find themselves and their spouses, children and agents denied entry into the U.S.

<P><DD>		Many companies have taken, and will continue to take action to plan their way around or out of this crossfire, but given the likelihood that the next step in this political conflict will likely see both Canada and the U.S. looking for enforcement "examples" instead of taking further symbolic legislative initiatives, there is a very real risk that companies and their directors and officers who are not fully informed about both the U.S. and the Canadian laws will find themselves subject to proceedings in one country or the other.

<P><CENTER><H1>CANADIAN PRIVATE SECTOR<BR>IS/IT OUTSOURCING</H1>
<I>By John Kazanjian, McMillan Binch<BR>
and</BR>
Robert Zahler, Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge</I></CENTER>


<P>The business process re-engineering trend has lent momentum to the rising
wave of U.S. private sector IS/IT outsourcing transactions.  The value of these deals
is estimated to be approximately US$10 billion in 1995 - and that number is projected
to double within three years.  This wave is now reaching Canadian shores with major
private sector outsourcing transactions being completed this year in the financial
services and airlines industries, and several other large deals now moving beyond the
planning stages. While IS/IT outsourcing transactions have been, and will continue to
be, relied upon by the cash pressed Canadian public sector - particularly provincial
and municipal governments and agencies -  it is the rapid growth of interest in the
Canadian private sector that is catching attention. </P>


<P>While IS/IT outsourcing transactions can take a variety of forms and cover a
broad range of a company's internal information services (data centre, back office,
client/server, network management), they essentially involve the up-front transfer of
all or part of a company's information services facilities, technology and personnel
to an outsourcing "vendor", and the medium to long term supply of those services back
to the  company by the vendor.  Variations include "co-sourcing" relationships where
the customer takes an equity interest in a special purpose entity providing the
service.  Viewed from a legal perspective, outsourcing contracts are highly complex,
relationship-based arrangements that borrow from elements normally found in asset
purchase agreements, joint venture arrangements, management contracts and technology
licences, and contain lengthy and technical schedules of assets and performance
standards. </P>
<BR>
<H3>Rationale</H3>

<P>The strategic rationale for the customer is to focus on core competencies
and  leave the job of managing information system support functions to such
specialists as ISM (IBM), Bell Sygma, EDS and others whose ability to realize
efficiencies and secure access to new technologies can reduce the company's overall
information services costs and ensure that its IS/IT capabilities are kept
up-to-date.   The financial rationale is to reduce ongoing information service costs,
possibly receive an up-front payment for IS/IT assets, and remove non-income
producing assets from the balance sheet.  Other advantages to the "buy" vs. "make"
alternative include relieving the company of employee responsibilities and related
costs, creating an alliance with a leading information technology company and helping
to redefine the corporate culture to one that is more focussed on doing only what it
does best. </P>

<P>Canadian private sector IS/IT outsourcing is still in an early growth stage,
notwithstanding the strong marketing efforts of a highly capable vendor community. 
But, as  the U.S. experience demonstrated, dramatic market growth occurs only after a
sufficient number of credible customers have been seen to have successfully entered
into these kinds of deals.  It is for this reason that the recent Canadian financial
services and airline transactions are so significant.  The financial services sector
transaction involved the National Bank of Canada outsourcing back office and related
functions. If the U.S. experience that saw banks and insurance companies at the
forefront of IS/IT outsourcing transactions is representative, other Canadian
financial institutions can be expected to build on the National Bank of Canada
experience. </P>
<BR>
<H3>Air Canada</H3>

<P>In the airline transaction, we worked together to represent Air Canada in
what is to date the largest Canadian private sector IS/IT outsourcing transaction. 
In a long and complex negotiation with IBM and DMR, Air Canada transferred over 900
people and most of its, and its Gemini affiliate's, IS/IT systems to a new IBM
subsidiary, Advantis Canada. The transfers involved 2 data centres, private WANs,
LANs, PBX's, terminals, help desks and end-user support and applications maintenance
and development. </P>

<P>At an IS/IT outsourcing conference held by DCI in Toronto last month, Andre
Villeneuve, Manager, Outsourcing Performance Management, of Air Canada detailed his
company's experience and explained how Air Canada approached the negotiation of the
transactions, what it saw as the benefits and success factors, and what, with the
benefit of hindsight, others might see as areas for possible improvement.  He
identified the value of thorough preparation before approaching the negotiation
including understanding and documenting all existing IS/IT costs and system needs. 
Mr. Villeneuve also stressed the importance of taking human resource issues into
account at all stages of the process. </P>
<BR>
<H3>Strategic and Legal Factors</H3>

<P>At the same conference we offered our observations on the strategic and
legal considerations that potential outsourcing customers need to address.  Bob
Zahler addressed the significant level of change going on within the outsourcing
marketplace and the opportunities and risks that this change presents for potential
IS/IT outsourcing customers.  There have been changes in vendors, such as the recent
acquisitions of DMR and SHL System-House,  new and varied product offerings, and new
business structures such as vendor consortiums that need to be factored into a
customer's analysis.  Zahler explained the importance of following a comprehensive
and disciplined process in the face of these changes.  For example, customers should
closely analyze their existing IS/IT facilities and come to a view as to their future
needs well before entering into discussions with potential vendors.  This not only
positions the company for meaningful comparisons of vendor proposals and ultimately
for negotiations, but it also can simplify what many find to be an intrusive and
lengthy vendor due diligence process.  His bottomline observation based on his
extensive U.S. experience was that the successful IT/IS outsourcing transactions were
the ones that identified  the objectives of both vendors and customers early on and
built-in incentives for all parties to achieve their desired aims. </P>
<BR>
<H3>Canadian Legal Issues</H3>

<P>John Kazanjian explained why the relationship component in these contracts
cannot be underestimated given the stresses that will inevitably arise from
unforeseeable future changes in technology, business objectives and the
tax/regulatory landscape during the course of the contract.  No less important is a
fair and effective exit mechanism to preserve customer leverage and to ensure that
intellectual property and related rights can be transferred to another vendor or be
brought back in house on a tax effective functional basis should the relationship not
succeed.  </P>

<P>Kazanjian went on to address the distinct Canadian legal and business issues
that need to be addressed in private sector IS/IT outsourcing transactions. These
include confidentiality, tax (income, GST, PST), employee transfers (seniority,
unions, pensions, benefits, severance, relocation etc.), dispute resolution, software
licensing, intellectual property rights, personal property security interests,
financing arrangements and corporate and management structures, and what many
potential customers may see as unnecessarily lengthy and thorough vendor due
diligence. </P>
<BR>
<H3>Growing Interest</H3>

<P>Canadian private sector IS/IT outsourcing arrangements, particularly in the
information dependent financial services sector, are likely to become far more common
in the coming years. For those considering such transactions, there may be an initial
inclination to work out the terms of a business "partnership" with a highly
experienced vendor and wait until the negotiations are nearing completion before
seeking legal input, and then only to review the vendor's "usual" terms and
conditions.  Such an approach carries very significant risks that could be eliminated
if advice were sought at the conception stages of a possible transaction.  A well
briefed customer will not buy into such "myths" as outsourcing contracts having to be
for the long term, or that a "successful" contract will not need to be referenced on
an ongoing basis by the parties after it is signed. </P>

<P>There are no "garden variety" outsourcing transactions as each must be
tailored to the customer's needs and circumstances, particularly where reliable,
timely and accurate information is business critical.  Potential customers must think
through in advance and position themselves for the negotiation and due diligence
stages, strive to preserve their bargaining leverage and ensure that potential
problem areas are addressed in the contract and not left to be resolved during the
term of the agreement.</P>

<B>CANADIAN BAR ASSOCIATION (ONT.) MEDIA &amp; COMMUNICATIONS
SECTION</B>
<P>
<B>NOVEMBER 7, 1996 MEETING TOPIC: ALL THE LATEST IN INTERNET
LAW<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>SUMMARY OF PRESENTATION ON COPYRIGHT LAW<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
For the most part, the Canadian copyright law is flexible (and
technology neutral) enough to deal with new media including media
never contemplated by the drafters of the legislation.<BR>
<P>
For example, the 1924 Copyright Act protects computer programs,
CD-ROMs, web sites, and interactive games (case law in the U.S.
states that interactive games meet the requirement of fixation).
And the rules concerning the ownership and duration of copyright
equally pertain to digital works. Further, licensing and contractual
issues can be adapted to the &quot;new technology&quot; fact situations,
and remedies can apply to digital media.<BR>
<P>
In other words, it is not so much the provisions of the Copyright
Act or the cases interpreting them where the Internet and on-line
community are challenging current copyright laws, rather on the
administrative and enforcement side and in contractual relationships
governing copyright works.<BR>
<P>
On the administrative side, the major issue is rights clearances.
A single CD-ROM can store over 650 megabytes of information, roughly
equivalent to 250,000 pages of text. How many copyright works
is that -- hence, the rights clearance nightmare. And a multimedia
developer/producer/publisher requires rights not only to use copyright
works in the multimedia project itself, but because of the end-use
of multimedia works, they may want to sub-license these rights
to end users for such things as on-line use, making hard copies,
interactive use, etc.<BR>
<P>
Rights can be cleared directly from rights holders and often from
copyright collectives and other licensing agencies who represent
them. But do the copyright collectives like SOCAN and CANCOPY
play a role in such clearances? And what about the exceptions
in the Copyright Act and the fair dealing provision -- are they
of help?<BR>
<P>
Perhaps the greatest hurdle which the publisher/developer faces
is the quantity of different copyright works used in a multimedia
new work. For instance, in the first twenty seconds of a CD-ROM,
there may be music, text from a periodical article, graphics such
as a painting or photograph, and clips from a film. The publisher/developer
of the CD-ROM must obtain copyright permission from each of the
appropriate rights holders for each of the necessary rights. Written
material must be cleared from the author, publisher (newspaper
or periodical), or possibly from a reprography (copyright) collective.
For music, three different rights must be cleared, the reproduction
right, the synchronization right (combining music with visuals)
and the right to publicly perform the music. Further, rights must
be cleared for the graphics and use of the film clips.<BR>
<P>
Moral rights are also an important issue in digital works because
such works can be so easily manipulated.<BR>
<P>
Although the law guides publishers/developers as to when they
need to clear copyright permission, they nonetheless face a number
of administrative problems. For instance, they have to contact
every copyright holder or his or her representative to obtain
copyright permission. This can be time-consuming in sending out
letters, faxes, making phone calls, etc., and copyright holders
may not reply as quickly as the publisher/developer may need and
can stall the progress of a project. Also, it is costly in obtaining
all of these rights and confusing as industry standards regarding
the details of licensing works to be used in an electronic format
and fair compensation to copyright holders have not yet been established.
<BR>
<P>
Once cleared, there are a number of licensing issues to consider,
and then the issue of policing of copyright works on the 'net.
<BR>
<P>
Another important question in this area is who is responsible
for works on the 'net that infringe copyright -- the publisher/developer
of the website, the distributor (e.g., internet service provider)
or the consumer who uses the work?<BR>
<P>
Although the Canadian government currently has a copyright bill
in the House of Commons, it does not specifically deal with 'net
issues and the government is waiting until the next phase (at
an undetermined time) to deal with such issues. In the meantime,
a Diplomatic Conference is taking place in early December 1996
where the Canadian government as well as governments around the
world will meet at the World Intellectual Property Organization
(WIPO) in Geneva to deal with copyright law issues as they affect
the internet and other digital media. Depending on the results
of the Conference, international documents may guide us to revising
the Canadian Copyright Act to meet some of the concerns of the
digital age that can be addressed by legislation. And as the digital
media industry matures, we will experience many applications of
copyright law to the newer technology, and industry standards,
for example in the situation of licensing works for digital media,
will also mature.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I><FONT SIZE="-1">The views expressed in this speech are those of the author and
do not reflect the views of the Canadian Association of Internet
Providers, except to the extent that previously approved documents
or positions of CAIP are cited.
</FONT></I></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<FONT SIZE="+2"> T</FONT>hank you for the opportunity of speaking tonight. I was advised
to stick to what I know,  and so this will necessitate a brief
speech.
<P>
 There was a story told by the head of  the legal section of a
large on-line service provider about a new lawyer he had just
hired. She said &quot;I don't know anything about Internet law&quot;.
He said &quot;don't worry; there only two cases, you can read
them in an afternoon, and they contradict each other.&quot; He
was referring of course to Stratton Oakmonth versus Prodigy and
 Cubby v. Compuserve .
<P>
 You can learn all about the law of the Internet in an afternoon,
in one sense. In another, the Internet gives rise to some delicious
legal and regulatory issues about which society will be debating
for years to come. These include the possibilities for economic
and moral regulation of the Internet, as well as determining the
 legal rights in new forms of property. The previous speakers,
Simon Chester and Lesley Harris, have given a thorough review
of the &quot;propertarian &quot; aspects of Internet issues and
there is nothing I can add to what they have said.
<P>
 I shall try to limit my remarks to those aspects of the Internet
that relate to speech and communication.
<P>
 I shall start with the basics. CAIP is the Canadian Association
of Internet Providers, an industry association which has gathered
the major Internet service providers. Currently we number about
forty five (45) members, including the Stentor telephone companies,
the larger independent Internet service providers, hereafter referred
to as ISP's, and several major cable companies. We have regional
national and local members.
<P>
 An Internet service provider runs a simple business. You lease
lines from the telephone companies to provide dial access from
the telephone company's switches. You lease dedicated high capacity
optical fibre pipes from companies like Sprint or MCI that allow
access to the Internet from your central office. In that respect
ISP's are customers of telephone companies, performing a value-added
service.
<P>
 The customer supplies himself with the access to the telephone
company through his own leased lines. While the customer may soon
have other options, including cable, local radio-based access,
or even satellite access, for the moment, the telephone companies
control the facilities that allow mass market access to the Internet.
<P>
 Second, the ISP supplies the customer with a disc of software
that enables him to use the Internet, and supplies on-line support
staff to explain the many difficulties that  inevitably arise
when users accustom themselves to vast amounts of new software
without the benefit of explanatory books.
<P>
 Third, the ISP can offer other services, such as for instance,
the development of web-pages for customers. Large ISP's may also
be developing other services, but they have not been announced
yet and I know nothing about what they might be.
<P>
 CAIP was founded  last year because it was felt that Internet
Service Providers would need the ability to act collectively for
common purposes. And in this the founders were right. The ISP,
and the Internet generally, has attracted the attention of every
tax-collector known to man, including the copyright lawyer, the
subsidizer of Canadian broadcasting, and the subsidizers of local
telephone calls.  Because it is the cheapest form of world-wide
publishing yet developed, it has also attracted the attention
of the upholders of various orthodoxies realize that this medium
allows the propagation of heresy, pornography, and thoughtcrime
outside the control of traditional broadcasting or publishing
regimes.
<P>
 Again, let's look to some other basic facts. While 30% of Canadian
households possess a computer, only some 8% of households report
that the Internet was accessed from home. (Stats Can household
facilities survey 1996).  A telephone survey of 2,600 Canadians
taken in September by International Data Corporation (Canada)
Ltd. showed that residential access 8.9%, school access 4.9% and
access from work 8.8%. IDC calculates that household access will
rise to 10.5% by the end of this year and 30.5% by the end of
the year 2000. Compare this to the fact that the telephone was
invented in the 1880's and that telephone penetration rose to
the thirty percent level only around the 1930's.
<P>
 Access to the Internet was made possible by the three important
developments: the  cheap computer, a somewhat deregulated and
largely competitive telephone system, and the invention of protocols
that allow computers to talk to one another.
<P>
In policy terms the most important decision was to break up AT&amp;T.
Without the stimulus of competition, the Internet might remain
the preserve of scholars in subsidized environments. Without the
cheap computer, there would not be the physical apparatus to make
it possible, and without TC/IP protocol from Tim Berners-Lee of
CERN, and others like it, such as JAVA, the computers could not
link.
<P>
 Computers have been invented, and nothing can be done to make
them stop communicating. But compare the computer's communicating
capacity to the miserable conduits through which signals must
pass to reach the Internet. My modem is 28.8 kilobits per second.
My computer runs on hundreds of millions of bits per second. Three
to four orders of magnitude separate the internal speed of my
computer from the speed of the device through which it communicates
to the outer world. Computers are a bit like the great English
physicist Stephen Hawking, forced to communicate to the world
through wholly inadequate bodies. This amazing device on my desktop
is still communicating through a wire whose basic characteristics
were laid down in the time of Queen Victoria!
<P>
 The Internet is therefore only the first stage of the linking
of people through computers. It is the first manifestation of
what happens when communications media are fully computerized.
If this is what can be done over modems running in the thousands
of bits per second, imagine what can be done when the whole network
is one vast series of linked nodes of intelligence, pulling down
information and processing power to any place on the globe. The
desktop computer as such may dissolve back into the network: and
we will be wholly indifferent as to where the intelligence is
located so long as it works for us.
<P>
 Vinton Cerf, the guy who runs the Internet operations for MCI,
the US long distance operator, expects there to be 300 million
nodes on the Internet by the end of the year 2001. This is three
hundred million potential websites, publishers, libraries, parallel
processors, and television broadcasters. Or as I have said: imagine
a world where every telephone number is a potential broadcaster.
I think you get the point. There seems to be no scarcity here
to regulate.
<P>
So let us turn to some imaginary questions that government might
think need answering.
<P>
<H3>Q. How will the Internet affect the future of your organization?</H3>

<FONT SIZE="+2">A.</FONT>The Internet, understood as the linking of computers to each
other over ever better communications devices, will continue to
revolutionize how you do work, what work is, how you entertain
yourself, whether your organization will continue to exist, and
whether your trade or business  has power. The Internet is everything
you can think. Like Mozart, it cannot be overrated.
<P>
<H3>Q. What is the appropriate role for governments in the ongoing
development of the Internet?</H3>

<FONT SIZE="+2">A.</FONT> Government should provide a stable and transparent legal structure
in which the ability of people to communicate with one another
cheaply and freely through computers will be assured to the extent
that technology and markets permit.
<P>
<H3>Q. What additional measures are needed to address concerns about
things such as rates charged by service suppliers, standards,
or content issues (e.g. Canadian content, pornography, libel,
liability)?</H3>

<FONT SIZE="+2">A.</FONT>
<ol>
<li>rates for access will be set in increasing competitive conditions,
as wired and wireless options expand.  Current telecommunications
policies in this regard are moving in the right direction.
<P>
<li>Standards will be set cooperatively. The Internet runs on protocols
that took no government to create or enforce.
<P>
<li>The existence of Canadian content is guaranteed by the presence
of Canadians on the Internet: we do not worry about Canadian content
on the telephone system as Canadian speakers provide the content.
If something like programming content that we associate with broadcasting
needs to be supplied, then existing subsidy mechanisms, such a
Telefilm and the CBC, can provide such content.
<P>
<li>As to other forms of content, CAIP has no objection to the
publishers of material being held responsible for their speech
and publications. We simply insist that ISP's are transparent
conduits, and as such have the same liabilities as telephone companies
for the traffic passing through our routers.
</ol>
<P>
<H3>Q. What measures are needed to ensure that public good applications,
such as education, health, public safety, figure prominently in
the development of the Internet in Canada?</H3>

<FONT SIZE="+2">A.</FONT> I am not sure that anything need be done that cannot be done
by the institutions themselves. As Internet access depends on
cheap computers and cheap bandwidth, and both result from competitive
market conditions, public goods will flow from the widespread
availability and use by public institutions of the  Internet.
 If the government finds ways to broaden citizen participation
by use of the Internet, or lever its production of Internet documents
into some national good, who could object? But the government
has no special role to play in fostering some uses of the Internet
at the expense of all others, as subsidies would imply.
<P>
<H3>Q. Should the ISP industry consider special rate structures for
public institutions like schools and hospitals?</H3>

<FONT SIZE="+2">A.</FONT> No. CAIP opposes social subsidies for transmissions for special
institutions.  Government can act to keep bandwidth cheap, by
allowing for competition in delivery systems,  and computers can
be relied upon to become ever cheaper. The rest will follow.
Subsidies are always elements of distortion that cause the &quot;need&quot;
for regulation.
<P>
<H3>Q. How can the Internet provide more information and services
in the French language?</H3>

<FONT SIZE="+2">A.</FONT> It can't. The entity called the Internet provides nothing.
People using the Internet provide materials in their own language,
if they so choose. Internet access is slightly lower for French
language speakers in Canada (~13%),  from all sources, then it
is for English language speakers (19%), and it is lower for them
than for those in Canada whose primary language is other than
either (22%). So what?
<P>
<H3>Q. Regarding the application of existing legislation:
<P>
<ul>
<li><I>Should content services delivered by the Internet and or ISP's
be subject to the Broadcasting Act?
</I><P>
<li><I>Should ISP's be regulated as common carriers under the Telecommunications
Act?
</I></ul>
</H3>

<FONT SIZE="+2">A.</FONT> To the question whether we <I>should</I> apply the Broadcasting Act,
I can only say that this is absurd, and as to whether broadcasting
regulation could be made to apply, I can only say that it would
be impossible. Where is the scarcity that would make regulation
effective, even if it were legal and constitutionally possible?
If every telephone number or IP address in North America is a
potential source of programming, and there are billions such numbers,
where is the antenna that government can take down? What is it
that you can effectively padlock? What is the entry barrier that
gives a licence any economic value? What scarcity rent can be
extracted from an endless supply of cheap bandwidth?
<P>
 As to the question of whether we should apply the Broadcasting
Act,  I can only say that it is to misconstrue the nature of the
technology in a quite fundamental way. I realize that much ink
will be spilled on this question as to the constitutionality of
applying the Broadcasting Act to the Internet, and I shall be
doing my share presently.  But one thing stands out clearly from
two recent cases where the Courts have had to consider the real
nature of technologies in order to ascertain constitutional issues.
I refer to the Alberta Government Telephones (AGT) case, where
the Supreme Court in 1987, and the Canadian federal courts before
them, had to consider the nature of the telephone system and determine
whether jurisdiction over it could be divided along the lines
of intraprovincial-extraprovincial traffic. And I refer also to
the recent case of  <I>ACLU v. Reno</I>  where the US Federal Court of
Appeals had some fundamental observations to make of the Internet.

<P>
 In both cases, the approach of the Court was to take evidence
concerning the nature and operations of the system under consideration.
The technology was examined in depth. In the Canadian case regarding
telephones, the examination of the technology of telecommunications
revealed clearly that they were &quot;connecting undertakings&quot;
within the meaning of the exception to provincial powers in section
92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. The same logic was applied to
find that even wholly intraprovincial telephone companies were
&quot;connecting undertakings&quot; in the Gu&egrave;vremont case
a few years later. If I had  been able to collect $50 from every
telecom bureaucrat who said that the feds would never gain full
jurisdiction over Canadian telecommunications, either because
they would settle, or that the law was not on the federal side,
I  could feed you all with French champagne for two hours.
<P>
In the case of the Internet, I refer to Mr. Justice Dalzell's
remarks in ACLU v. Reno, to the effect that &quot;First Amendment
jurisprudence compels us to consider the special qualities of
the new medium in determining whether the Communications Decency
Act is a constitutional exercise of governmental power&quot;,
 and as to the Internet itself, he found
<P>
&quot;First, the Internet presents very low barriers to entry.
 Second, these barriers to entry are identical to both speakers
and listeners. Third, as a result of these low barriers, astoundingly
diverse content is available on the Internet. Fourth, the Internet
provides significant access to all who wish to speak in the medium,
and even creates a relative parity among speakers.&quot;
<P>
I could think of no greater contrast with the over-the-air broadcasting
system than this. And that is why, when all the recondite legal
arguments regarding spectrum scarcity, treaty-making powers, POGG,
and video-on-demand are finished, the learned justices of this
land will  click their mice on to the Internet and discover for
themselves that this is no broadcasting system.
<P>
<H3>Q. Regarding the application of existing legislation:
<P>
<ul>
 <li><I>Should ISP's be regulated as common carriers under the Telecommunications
Act?</I></ul>
</H3>

<FONT SIZE="+2">A.</FONT> No. Common carriers have obligations to serve which are irrelevant
in a competitive environment where ISP's do not control access
to bottleneck facilities. In fact, the Telecommunications Act
excludes ISP's from the Act entirely.
<P>
<H3>Q. Should ISP's be held liable for content delivered over their
networks or are they just providing a transparent conduit? </H3>

<FONT SIZE="+2">A.</FONT>  They are a transparent conduit.
<P>
<H3>Q. Should ISP's be liable for the content stored on their servers
or their customers' servers?</H3>

<FONT SIZE="+2">A.</FONT> Not in general. Anyone who has stood in the middle of a room
full of electronic boxes and listened to the hum of traffic can
tell you that there is little point in making the ISP liable for
stored information. In CAIP's view, the ISP should be liable to
take such actions as are required by law to bring his content
into conformity with the law, to the extent he is informed by
proper authorities of this  content and validly required to take
legally sanctioned action. A general liability for content on
one's servers - content that one has not edited or created - would
serve no purpose.
<P>
As to content that one has created or edited, then one should
have all the normal liabilities of publishers and writers.
<P>
<H3>Q. If no, who should be liable for illegal content on servers and what are the appropriate mechanisms to deal with it?  Do existing laws need modifications to address these concerns?</H3>

<FONT SIZE="+2">A. </FONT>The authors and publishers of web pages should be responsible for the content of same.  ISP's are not to be liable merely because offending or illegal materials happen to be stored, cached or transferred through their routers and servers.  To this end CAIP has developed and approved a Code of Conduct that is essentially complaint-driven, and which we believe respects the interest of society in a lawful social discourse, and that of speakers for free speech.

<H2>THE KNOW<I>law</I>&#153; GROUP BREAKS NEW GROUND</H2>

  <BR>
<BR>
Although Doug Barrett is a Toronto lawyer, his typical daily schedule
smacks more of Hollywood than of Bay Street.  On any given morning,
he might be working on an application to the Canadian Radio-Television
and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for a new television
station license, negotiating the financing and production of a
new Canadian comedy series or representing a Hollywood studio
in its negotiations with the Canadian producer of a children's
television series. <BR>
<BR>
Doug is one of the founding members of McMillan Binch's KNOW<I>law</I>&#153;
Group, a team of lawyers who center their practice around knowledge-based
industries such as media, entertainment, technology and telecommunications.
 The KNOW<I>law</I>&#153; Group was formed in the early '90s when it
became apparent that the firm could best serve its knowledge-based
industry clients with a consolidated, service team made up of
lawyers completely immersed in this expanding world.         
   <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are very much a part of our clients' environment.  We
know the players, the issues, the sensitivities; and we participate
actively on many levels,&quot; says Doug.  &quot;For instance,
Ron Hay, another member of the KNOW<I>law</I>&#153; Group, is the editor
of Binchmarks, our legal column that has appeared for eight years
in Playback, Canada's broadcast and production journal.  We also
sit on many industry boards and travel to events across the country
to meet our clients on their home turf.   The fact that members
of our group worked on 9 of the 20 Canadian feature films in this
September's Toronto International Film Festival is indicative
of our group's deep involvement in our client's industry.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Another reason for the group's success is its ability to work
with client companies who are rapidly changing and branching out
into new ventures.  Notes Diana Cafazzo, another KNOW<I>law</I>&#153;
lawyer, &quot;Our clients often find themselves evolving into
multi-industry concerns as they develop and grow.  A film producer
may move into multi-media or broadcasting or into the music business.
 Our KNOW<I>law</I>&#153; team can help them to cross these bridges successfully.&quot;
     <BR>
<BR>
In fact, the KNOW<I>law</I>&#153; lawyers enjoy the proliferation of
leading edge projects that constantly come their way.  &quot;In
this business, there are no cookie-cutter deals, and there are
few precedents,&quot; reflects Doug.  &quot;Everyday, our job
is to find creative solutions to business or legal problems that
have never been faced before.   That challenge is what really
makes us tick.&quot;       <BR>

<H2>Information
Services and Technology Outsourcing</H2>

<P>The business process re-engineering trend has resulted in an increase in private-sector information services and technology
outsourcing transactions in the United States in the last three years. These deals are estimated to be worth approximately
US$10 billion in 1995, and that number has been projected to double in the next three years. Information Services/Information
Technology (IS/IT) private-sector outsourcing transactions have also increased in Canada and major outsourcing transactions
were completed in the last year in the financial services and airlines sectors. As well, several other large deals are now
moving beyond the planning stages. While IS/IT outsourcing transactions have been, and will continue to be, relied upon by the
cash-pressed Canadian public sector, it is the rapid growth of Canadian private-sector interest that has become noteworthy.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>What is IS/IT Outsourcing</B></FONT><BR>
Information services and technology outsourcing transactions take a variety of forms and can cover a
broad range of a company's internal information services including data centre, back office, client/server and network
management. Essentially, however, they involve the up-front transfer of all or part of a company's information services
facilities, technology and personnel to an outsourcing vendor and the medium to long-term supply of those services back to the
company by the vendor. Variations include co-sourcing relationships, where the customer takes an equity interest in a special
purpose entity providing the service. Outsourcing contracts are highly complex, relationship-based arrangements that borrow
from elements normally found in asset-purchase agreements, joint-venture arrangements, management contracts and technology
licences, and contain lengthy and technical schedules of assets and performance standards.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Rationale for IS/IT</B></FONT><BR>
The strategic rationale for the customer is to focus on core competencies and leave the job of managing
information system support functions to specialists such as ISM (IBM), CGI, EDS and others whose ability to realize
efficiencies and secure access to new technologies can reduce the company's overall information services costs and ensure that
its IS/IT capabilities are kept up-to-date. The financial rationale is the potentially significant up-front payment for the IS/IT
assets, the removal of non-income producing assets from its balance sheet, and the reduction of ongoing information service
costs. Other advantages to outsourcing include relieving the company of employee responsibilities and related costs, creating
alliances with leading information technology companies, and redefining the corporate culture to one that is more focused on
doing only what the company does best.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>IS/IT Outsourcing Growing in Canada</B></FONT><BR>
Canadian private sector IS/IT outsourcing is still in an early growth stage,
notwithstanding the strong market efforts of a highly capable vendor community. But, as the U.S. experience demonstrated,
dramatic market growth occurs only after a sufficient number of credible customers have been seen to have successfully entered
into such deals. It is probably for this reason that the recent Canadian financial services and airline transactions have been
attracting much attention.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Airline Transaction</B></FONT><BR>
In the airline transaction, McMillan Binch worked with the leading U.S. outsourcing law firm of Shaw
Pittman, representing Air Canada in what is to date the largest Canadian private-sector IS/IT outsourcing transaction. In a
long and complex negotiation with IBM and DMR, Air Canada transferred more than 900 people and most of its, and its Gemini
affiliate's, IS/IT systems to new IBM subsidiary, Advantis Canada. The transfer involved two data centres, private WANs, LANs,
PBXs, terminals, help desks and end-user support and applications maintenance and development.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Financial Services Sector Transaction</B></FONT><BR>
An equally important financial services sector transaction involved the National Bank of
Canada outsourcing its back office and related functions. If the U.S. experience that saw banks and insurance companies at the
forefront of IS/IT outsourcing transactions is representative, other Canadian financial institutions can be expected to build
on the National Bank of Canada initiative.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>IS/IT Outsourcing Conference</B></FONT><BR>
At an IS/IT outsourcing conference which DCI held in Toronto last month, Michael Labont&eacute;, Senior
Vice President of the National Bank of Canada and Andre Villeneuve, Manager, Outsourcing Performance Management of Air Canada
detailed their companies' experiences with these Canadian IS/IT outsourcing deals. They explained how they approached the
negotiation of the transactions, what they saw as the benefits and success factors, and what their experience demonstrated
were areas for improvement.</P>

<P>John Kazanjian of McMillan Binch, speaking at the same conference, provided his observations on how a potential customer who
is approaching a highly complex outsourcing transaction for the first time can help offset the advantages in experience and
bargaining power that the major vendors bring to the table. He explained the importance of the relationship component in these
contracts and identified techniques for addressing, in the contract, unforeseeable but inevitable future changes in
technology, business objectives, and the tax/regulatory landscape.</P>

<P>Equally important is a fair and effective exit mechanism to preserve customer leverage and to ensure that intellectual
property and related rights can be transferred to another vendor or be brought back in-house on a tax-effective functional basis
should the relationship not succeed. While the input of highly experienced U.S. experts can contribute significantly, there
are distinct Canadian legal and business issues that need to be addressed, particularly with respect to confidentiality, tax
(income, GST, PST), employee transfers (seniority, unions, pensions, benefits, severance, relocation, etc.), dispute
resolution, software licensing, intellectual property rights, personal property security interests, financing arrangements and
corporate and management structures, and what many potential customers may see as unnecessary, lengthy and thorough vendor due
diligence.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>IS/IT Outsourcing Arrangements</B></FONT><BR>
Private sector IS/IT outsourcing arrangements, particularly in the information-dependent
financial services sector, are likely to become far more common in Canada in the coming years. For those considering such
transactions, there may be an initial inclination to work out the terms of a business partnership with a highly experienced
vendor and wait until the negotiations are nearing completion before seeking legal input, and then only to review the vendor's
usual terms and conditions. Such an approach carries very significant risks that could be eliminated if advice were sought at
the conception stages of a possible transaction. There are no garden variety outsourcing transactions as each must be tailored
to the customer's needs and circumstances, particularly for financial services industry participants where reliable, timely
and accurate information is critical. Experienced advisers can assist in positioning the company for the negotiation and due
diligence stages, preserving the customer's bargaining leverage, offsetting the customer's relative lack of experience with
key outsourcing agreement protections, and ensuring that potential problem areas are addressed in the contract and not left to
be resolved during the term of the agreement. John Kazanjian 416 865-7071</P>

<H2>More Changes to the Ontario Laws on Powers of Attorney</H2>

<P>The <I>Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 (SDA)</I> was introduced in Ontario in April of 1995. It made profound changes to the law
governing powers of attorney governed by Ontario law or given by persons residing in Ontario or covering assets located in
Ontario. As a result of the introduction of the SDA, most financial institutions revised their forms and the procedures they
followed in connection with powers of attorney.</P>

<P>On November 15, 1995, less than a year after the SDA became law, Ontario's new Government introduced Bill 19 which proposes
further sweeping changes, including changes with respect to the witnessing requirements applicable to powers of attorney. 
These and the other changes proposed by Bill 19 may again require financial institutions to review their forms and procedures.</P>

<P>A Standing Committee is expected to hold public hearings on Bill 19 during the month of February with a view to submitting a
report to the House this spring. Subject to the Standing Committee's report, it is likely that Bill 19 will become law
sometime in late 1996.</P>

<H2>Proposed OSC Rule Assists Pledges<BR>of Public Company Securities</H2>

<P>The Ontario Securities Commission published notice on October 20, 1995 of a proposed rule which, if implemented, will assist
persons who take pledges of public company securities. At present there is uncertainty about the ability of a pledgee to sell
pledged securities if the securities are part of block of securities which together affect control of a public company. Sales
of control blocks of securities can only be made in reliance on a prospectus or a prospectus exemption. Sellers usually rely
on the prospectus exemption which permits such sales if certain conditions are met including if the <I>seller</I> has held the
securities for at least six months. However, in the context of a security arrangement, the issue is who is the seller: the
borrower who pledged the securities or the pledgee? There is also some uncertainty about when a pledgee of a block of 10% or
more of securities of a public company must issue an "early warning report" on the pledgee's power to exercise control or
direction over the pledged securities. The issue is: must the report be issued at the time of default or when the pledgee
registers the securities in its own name? The Proposed Rule seeks to clarify these issues. But a financial institution may
need to amend its pledge agreement to take advantage of some of the clarifications.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Realizations</B></FONT><BR>
The Proposed Rule provides that the prospectus exemption available to a pledgee on the sale of securities pledged
from the control block of a public company will be available so long as the securities have been held by the pledgor or the
pledgee or a combination of them in the aggregate for six months from the date the securities were acquired by the pledgor.
The exemption is available irrespective of additional acquisitions of securities of the same class by the pledgee unless the
pledgee has acquired securities of the same class under a prospectus exemption after deciding to dispose of the securities.
The pledgee may take pledges of additional securities of the same class without offending the provision restricting further
acquisitions.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Early Warning Reports</B></FONT><BR>
Ontario securities legislation requires persons who acquire ownership of, or the power to exercise
control or direction over, voting or equity securities of a public company that, together with the securities already held by
the person, would constitute 10% or more of the outstanding securities of that class to make public disclosure of the
acquisition (an early warning report). Depending on the terms of the pledge agreement, an early warning report may technically
be required on default. However, many financial institution pledgees have declined to make an early warning report in respect
of pledged securities until the securities are registered in the name of the pledgee (or its nominee) following default and
the pledgee has taken steps to realize on the securities (for example, by sending out notices of its rights to dispose of the
pledged shares in accordance with the PPSA).</P>

The Proposed Rule provides that, where a pledgee has the power to exercise control or direction over securities of a public
company pledged from a control block under a written pledge agreement and in the ordinary course of the pledgee's business,
the pledgee is exempt from the requirement to make an early warning report until the earlier of the time when the pledgee has:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>formally declared a default and determined that the power to vote or direct the voting or to dispose or direct
the disposition of the securities will be exercised; and<BR><BR>

<LI>determined that the power to dispose or to direct the disposition of the securities will be exercised because
the pledgee believes the securities have depreciated in value.<BR>
</UL>
This exemption from early warning reporting is only available if the pledge agreement:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>was not entered into with the purpose or with the effect of changing or materially affecting the control of
the issuer of the pledged securities; and<BR><BR>

<LI>unless entered into on or before March 31, 1996 (assuming the Proposed Rule is finalized on schedule) does not grant
the pledgee before default the power to vote or direct the voting of the pledged securities or the power to dispose or
direct the disposition of the pledged securities (except where they have depreciated in value).
</UL>
<P>Assuming that the Proposed Rule will be finalized on schedule (or even if finalization is delayed), financial institutions
should review their pledge agreements to ensure that they will contain the terms described above after March 31, 1996 (or
later date specified) so that the financial institutions can take advantage of this clarification of the early warning
requirement.</P>

<H2>Class Actions Against Financial Institutions:<BR>Maintaining the Institution's Defences.<BR>Examples From Early Warning Report</H2>

The <I>Class Proceedings Act</I> (CPA) became law in Ontario in January of 1993. Since that time, the CPA has been used in
actions involving breast implants and HIV transmitted through blood to permit a small number of persons to bring actions on
behalf of many other persons with similar claims. Recently, the CPA has been used by investors in a law suit against a
financial institution that provided financing to a failed construction project. McMillan Binch acted on behalf of the
financial institution in a precedent setting motion to divide the investors into subclasses of plaintiffs. The division into
subclasses was based on the facts relating to the different legal claims made by the investors against the financial
institution. The advantage of having divided the plaintiffs into subclasses is that the financial institution can now better
defend against the investors' claims.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The CPA</B></FONT><BR>
The CPA creates a procedural regime which enables persons to sue as a "class" (where one or more persons sue on behalf
of numerous persons having a similar or common interest). If an action is certified under the CPA as a class proceeding, one
or a small number of persons are designated as the representative plaintiff(s). Usually only the representative plaintiff(s)
will be actively involved in the litigation from that time forward. This reduction in the number of active plaintiffs
effectively reduces the costs of litigation for all plaintiffs. However, a class proceeding can oversimplify a case by
preventing a full examination of defences which may apply to members of the class other than the representative plaintiff(s).

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Decertification and Division into Subclasses under the CPA</FONT></B><BR>
In a law suit that is initially certified as a class proceeding,
any defendant can later ask the court to decertify the proceeding, or divide the plaintiffs into smaller groups of subclasses.
McMillan Binch recently brought the first decertification motion under the CPA on behalf of one of its financial institution
clients.</P>

<P>The financial institution and others were sued by over 150 investors in a construction project. The investors were represented
in the class action by three representative plaintiffs. The allegations made against the financial institution included breach
of contract, misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of trust. In view of the many individual factual and legal
issues raised by these allegations, McMillan Binch asked the court to decertify the proceeding or divide the group of
plaintiffs into more meaningful subclasses.</P>

<P>In the first decision of its kind, the court did not decertify the action but instead divided the plaintiffs into 15
subclasses based in part upon the various legal and factual defences available to the financial institution. In doing so, the
court observed that the objectives of the CPA should not be permitted to override the ultimate goal of a just determination of
the issues between the parties. The financial institution will now be able to examine for discovery the representative
plaintiff(s) of each subclass, and raise defences in a way which would not have been possible if the court had permitted the
investors to advance their claims through only three representative plaintiffs.</P>

<H2>Unilateral Minimum Advertised Price Programs</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Unilateral Minimum Advertised Price Programs ("UMAPs") have recently been explored by a number
of firms in the United States.  This bulletin discusses the legality of UMAPs in Canada, legal
alternatives for achieving the underlying business objectives, and related Canada-U.S. cross-border
considerations.</P><BR>

<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>

Many manufacturers have been revising distribution channel strategies in recent years in
response to the emergence of powerful warehouse and category killer chains. UMAPs are one of several
responses by manufacturers to increasingly sophisticated and powerful resellers.  

<BLOCKQUOTE>A typical UMAP has three fundamental elements:
<UL>
<LI>The manufacturer will refuse to sell products covered by the UMAP to resellers which advertise
the product for sale at less than a minimum advertised price established by the manufacturer.
<BR><BR>
<LI>The manufacturer will not enter into any negotiations or discussions with resellers regarding
the UMAP or violations thereof.
<BR><BR>
<LI>The reseller will remain free to establish its own selling prices, which may be above or below
the minimum advertised price.
</UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<H2>CANADIAN LEGAL FRAMEWORK</H2>

<P>The main legal issue raised by the UMAP concept in Canada is compliance with the price
maintenance rules in the <I>Competition Act</I>&nbsp;.<A NAME="1A"><A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></A>  Price maintenance is one of the areas in which there are
important differences between Canadian and foreign competition laws.  It is a criminal provision of
the <I>Competition Act</I>&nbsp; with two main branches, each of which is potentially applicable to a UMAP:
<FONT SIZE="-1">
<BLOCKQUOTE>61(1)No person who is engaged in the business of producing or supplying a product, ... shall,
directly or indirectly,
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>by agreement, threat, promise or any like means, attempt to influence upward, or to
discourage the reduction of, the price at which any other person engaged in business in Canada
supplies or offers to supply or advertises a product within Canada; or
<BR><BR>
<LI>refuse to supply a product to or otherwise discriminate against any other person engaged in
business in Canada because of the low pricing policy of that other person.
</OL></BLOCKQUOTE></P></FONT>
<P>We preface the discussion of the two branches with an overview of the penalties and enforcement
practices applicable to this offence, and conclude by reviewing possible defences.</P>

<H3>Penalties and Enforcement</H3>

<P>Price maintenance is a provision of the <I>Competition Act</I>&nbsp; which is enforced actively by the
competition authorities - particularly when complaints are brought to their attention, as often
occurs when a supplier terminates a relationship with a reseller.  The maximum penalty is a fine in
the discretion of the court (no maximum) and/or five years' imprisonment.  Parties injured by price
maintenance activity also have standing to bring a civil action for damages (single, not treble as in
the U.S.), regardless of whether a criminal prosecution has occurred.</P>

<P>Corporate fines in high profile price maintenance cases have been in the $100,000-$250,000
(Cdn.) range.  However, in recent years the Canadian competition authorities have been attempting to
obtain higher fines for competition law offences in order to enhance deterrence.  They have, for the
same reason, increasingly been charging individual executives in addition to corporations.  In a
recent price maintenance case in the real estate industry, two executives were fined a total of
$30,000 (Cdn.).<A NAME="2A"><A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A></A></P>

<H3>Attempting to Influence</H3>

The "attempting to influence" branch of the price maintenance offence involves the use of
certain prohibited methods to attempt to achieve a specific type of anti-competitive effect -
influencing a reseller to raise, or refrain from lowering, its prices.  The offence explicitly
applies to advertised as well as selling prices.

<H3><I>Prohibited Methods</I></H3>

<P>The prohibited methods of attempting to influence a reseller's pricing are agreements, threats,
promises and "any like means."  The phrase "any like means" has been given a narrow interpretation by
the courts.<A NAME="3A"><A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A></A>  Moreover, if a UMAP is indeed administered unilaterally - and is not incorporated by
reference as a term of a manufacturer's contracts with its resellers (eg. through a general clause
requiring the reseller to comply with standard terms and conditions established by the manufacturer)
- then there may not be any "agreement".<A NAME="4A"><A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></A>  However, Canadian competition authorities and courts would
almost certainly perceive a UMAP as implying either a threat or a promise.  The clear threat is that
the reseller will immediately be cut off if it reduces advertised prices below the minimum price
specified by the manufacturer.<A NAME="5A"><A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A></A>  The implicit promise is that the reseller will continue to be
supplied by the manufacturer if advertised prices remain at or above the specified level.</P>

<P>Section 61(3) of the <I>Act</I>&nbsp; contains a reverse onus provision which confirms the sensitive nature
of manufacturer communications to resellers about their pricing:
<FONT SIZE="-1">
<BLOCKQUOTE>61(3)  For the purposes of this section, a suggestion by a producer or supplier of a product of a
resale price or minimum resale price in respect thereof, however arrived at, is, in the absence of
proof that the person making the suggestion, in so doing, also made it clear to the person to whom
the suggestion was made that he was under no obligation to accept the suggestion and would in no way
suffer in his business relations with the person making the suggestion or with any other person if he
failed to accept the suggestion, proof of an attempt to influence the person to whom the suggestion
is made in accordance with the suggestion.</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></P>

<P>In the UMAPs we have seen, the manufacturer would be doing more than making a "suggestion" - a
reseller would clearly "suffer in his business relations" by not accepting the minimum advertised
price.</P>

<H3><I>Anti-Competitive Effects</I></H3>

<P>The price maintenance offence is intended to prevent manufacturers from putting upward pressure
on resellers' advertised or selling prices.  However, it is not necessary that any such effects occur
or be proved - it is the <B>attempt</B> to do so which constitutes the offence.  Similarly, no actual injury
to competition need be shown - it is essentially a <I>"per se"</I>&nbsp; offence.  Pro-competitive or
efficiency-enhancing effects are not considered.</P>

<P><I>R. v. Epson Canada Ltd.</I>&nbsp; is a noteworthy illustration.<A NAME="6A"><A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A></A>  Epson was charged with price
maintenance after inserting a clause into its standard dealer agreements which prohibited advertising
of (but not sales at) prices below Epson's suggested retail price.  Epson argued that the policy was
necessary because its products required high pre-sale service which would not be provided by full
service dealers unless they were shielded from the advertising of discounted prices by other dealers.
 An economic expert testified about the efficiency-enhancing rationale for such a policy (<I>eg.</I>,
avoiding free rider problems). Nevertheless, the court concluded that the offence was committed by
the insertion of the clause into the dealer agreements and that possible beneficial marketplace
effects were not a defence.</P>

<P>The likely practical effect of imposing a UMAP on resellers will be to discourage them from
reducing their advertised prices below the minimum advertised price specified by the manufacturer. 
Moreover, many Canadian resellers with aggressive pricing policies are familiar with section 61 of
the <I>Act</I>&nbsp;.  Thus there is a real possibility that complaints would be made to the competition
authorities.</P>

<H3><I>Intent</I>&nbsp;</H3>

<P>Under Canadian law, persons may be presumed to have intended the likely consequences of their
actions, and intent may be inferred from circumstantial evidence. Absent compelling internal
documentation of some other business rationale for a UMAP, Canadian competition authorities and
courts would almost certainly conclude that such a program was an attempt to discourage resellers
from lowering advertised prices below the levels prescribed by the manufacturer.</P>

<H3>Refusal to Supply</H3>

<P>The "refusal to supply" branch of the price maintenance offence applies where a current or
potential customer is refused supply (or otherwise discriminated against) because of its "low pricing
policy."  As with the "attempting to influence" branch, intent is required but anti-competitive
effects in the marketplace need not be shown.   </P>

<P>The adoption of a UMAP arguably does not involve any discrimination if the program applies
equally to all resellers of the manufacturer's products.  However, any termination of a reseller (or
other discriminatory action short of termination, such as denying a cooperative advertising
reimbursements) for violation of a UMAP would be illegal unless it was based on something other than
the "low pricing policy" of the reseller.<A NAME="7A"><A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A></A></P>

<P>Terminations of business relationships may, of course, be initiated for valid commercial
reasons;  however, such commercial reasons cannot be used as a pretext for terminations which are in
fact motivated by concerns about a reseller's low pricing.</P>

<H3>Defences</H3>

<P>The <I>Act</I>&nbsp; provides limited defences for affiliated entities and principal-agent situations. 
These will generally not be applicable to UMAPs.</P>

<P>The <I>Act</I>&nbsp; also contains partial defences in situations where a reseller appears to be engaging in
loss-leadering, bait-and-switch selling or misleading advertising of the manufacturer's products, or
not providing the level of servicing that purchasers of the products might reasonably expect.  While
these provisions might become relevant in dealings with specific resellers, they do not provide a
general basis for validating a UMAP.</P>

<H3>Summary</H3>

<P>There is a high risk that Canadian competition authorities and courts would conclude that the
adoption of a UMAP contravenes the attempting to influence branch of the price maintenance offence
(section 61(1)(a) of the <I>Competition Act</I>&nbsp;).  In addition, there is a high risk that any reliance upon
a UMAP to terminate an individual reseller would be found by the competition authorities and courts
to be a violation of the refusal to supply branch of the offence (section 61(1)(b) of the <I>Act</I>&nbsp;).</P>
<BR>

<H2>ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES</H2>

<P>The Canadian price maintenance law has broad application and limited flexibility.  Thus, there
are no obvious minor modifications to a UMAP which would ensure compliance with section 61 of the
<I>Competition Act</I>&nbsp;.  However, there may be other appropriate legal strategies available to achieve a
manufacturer's underlying business objectives.  These include:  using the <I>Competition Act</I>&nbsp; to resist
pressure from competing resellers; agency or consignment selling; alternative advertising strategies;
and, at the broadest level, other approaches for increasing reseller profitability.</P>

<H3>Resisting Reseller Pressure</H3>

<P>Complaints from resellers about the advertised prices of their competitors are often the
trigger which prompts a manufacturer to seek to exert some influence over downstream prices.  In
Canada, one possible response is to rely on the broad wording of section 61(1) of the <I>Act</I>&nbsp; as the
reason that the manufacturer is not legally able to take the requested action.  In addition, a
manufacturer may wish to consider reminding insistent resellers that they may be committing an
offence:
<FONT SIZE="-1">
<BLOCKQUOTE>61(6) No person shall, by threat, promise or any like means, attempt to induce a supplier, whether
within or outside Canada, as a condition of his doing business with the supplier, to refuse to supply
a product to a particular person or class of persons because of the low pricing policy of that person
or class of persons.</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></P>

<P>In short, both manufacturer and reseller have a common interest in avoiding the legal exposure
involved in attempting to discipline price-aggressive competing resellers.</P>

<H3>Agency or Consignment Selling</H3>

<P>It is possible for a manufacturer to control downstream selling and advertised prices by
supplying its products to distribution channel participants on an agency or consignment basis.  As
mentioned above, principal-agent relationships are specifically exempted from the criminal price
maintenance rules.<A NAME="8A"><A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A></A>  While consignment selling is a non-criminal "reviewable practice" under the
<I>Act</I>&nbsp;,<A NAME="9A"><A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A></A> such practices are entirely legal unless and until prohibited by an order of the Competition
Tribunal (which may only be made if specified anti-competitive effects are established). 
Notwithstanding the greater scope for control of resale prices using these distribution strategies,
they also raise other commercial and legal issues which need to be carefully assessed in any specific
situation.</P>

<H3>Advertising Strategies</H3>

<P>Conditioning cooperative advertising allowances on compliance with minimum selling or
advertised prices runs a high risk of violating the price maintenance rules in the <I>Act</I>&nbsp;.<A NAME="10A"><A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A></A>  A
cooperative advertising program which prohibited any references to prices in advertisements funded in
part by the supplier could also raise issues under the price maintenance provisions of the <I>Act</I>&nbsp;. 
However, informal communications with the competition authorities suggest there may be some room for
flexibility in this area.</P>

<P>A further alternative would be to reduce or eliminate cooperative advertising and spend such
funds on direct advertising instead.  A manufacturer may safely refer to suggested retail prices in
its own advertisements, provided it is made clear that individual resellers may sell for less.<A NAME="11A"><A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A></A> 
However, it would be necessary to consider the effectiveness and cost of direct manufacturer
advertising relative to cooperative advertising initiated by various resellers in their local market
areas.  Moreover, this approach would not prevent resellers from advertising lower prices on their
own.</P>

<H3>Other Approaches for Increasing Reseller Profitability</H3>

<P>Addressing reseller concerns over profitability is often said to be the underlying rationale
for a UMAP.  This presumably is of concern to a manufacturer because resellers' satisfaction and
motivation affect the manufacturer's sales and profits.  From a general marketing strategy
perspective, there are numerous variables which a manufacturer can use to influence reseller
profitability.  These include the number and types of direct and indirect channel members it sells
to, the prices charged to such resellers, cooperative advertising and other marketing support
programs, etc.</P><BR>


<H2>RELATED ISSUES</H2>

<P>Manufacturers selling into the Canadian market should be aware of two possible cross-border
implications of adopting a UMAP in the United States.</P>

<H3>"Spillover" Offences</H3>

<P>Many U.S. resellers have Canadian operations or are trans-shipping into Canada.  If a UMAP is
applied to such resellers' Canadian as well as U.S. activities, it is possible that the Canadian
competition authorities and courts would consider the <I>Competition Act</I>&nbsp; to have been violated.<A NAME="12A"><A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A></A>  To
safeguard against this possibility, manufacturers should:

<UL>
<LI>consider including a provision in the UMAP documentation which explicitly states that the
policy is not applicable to resellers' Canadian sales; and
<BR><BR>
<LI>develop appropriate control systems and procedures to ensure that the UMAP is not enforced
against the Canadian activities of U.S. resellers.
</UL></P>
<H3>Enforcement Agency Cooperation</H3>

<P>If a manufacturer decides to implement its U.S. UMAP or a variation thereof in Canada, it
should recognize that the Canadian competition authorities may seek access to relevant documentation
and other evidence located in the United States (<I>eg.</I>&nbsp; regarding the rationale for, development of and
implementation of the UMAP).  If such information was not forthcoming, it is possible that the
Canadian authorities would attempt to enlist the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice
pursuant to the <I>Canada-United States Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Treaty</I>&nbsp;.  Under the
treaty, the two countries' competition law enforcement agencies have broad scope for gathering and
exchanging evidence relevant to possible violations of the criminal provisions of their competition
laws.  (Similarly, should there be a reason for doing so, U.S. enforcement officials could seek
assistance from the Canadian authorities.)</P><BR>

<H2>CONCLUSIONS</H2>

<P>There is a high risk that UMAP's would be found by Canadian competition authorities and courts
to violate the price maintenance rules in the <I>Competition Act</I>&nbsp;.  Minor modifications are unlikely to
reduce materially the legal risks associated with the UMAP concept in Canada.</P>

<P>Alternatives for achieving the business objectives underlying a UMAP include: resisting
reseller pressure, agency or consignment selling, advertising strategies and other approaches for
increasing reseller profitability.
Firms which implement UMAP's in the U.S. should be aware of the possibility that application of
the UMAP to a U.S. reseller's Canadian operations or export sales could violate the Canadian
<I>Competition Act</I>&nbsp;.  Risks in this area are increased by the fact that Canadian and U.S. competition law
authorities have begun routinely assisting each other by gathering and exchanging evidence relevant
to proceedings under each other's criminal competition laws.</P>

<P>Firms with cross-border operations should therefore consider adding a provision to their U.S.
UMAP documentation which clarifies that the policy is not applicable to resellers' Canadian sales. 
In addition, it would be prudent to develop control systems and procedures to ensure that the UMAP is
not enforced against the Canadian activities of U.S. resellers.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=center>Toronto Stock Exchange Seeks<BR>Improved Disclosure -<BR>A Search for Balance</H2>
<H4 ALIGN=center>by<BR>J. William Rowley QC</H4>

<P>In mid-December 1995, following a process begun almost a year and a
half before, the Toronto Stock Exchange's Committee on Corporate Disclosure delivered
its interim report on needed initiatives to improve the effectiveness of corporate
disclosure in Canada.</P>

<P>If implemented, company directors, officers and advisers could soon face liability of
$25,000 - it could go much higher - if they issue misleading information about their
company. Companies themselves would be subject to damage claims (capped at $1 million
or 5% of market cap., whichever is greater) for any material misinformation and major
shareholders would be liable to heavy sanctions for knowingly influencing company
officials to release inaccurate information (see box for details). In addition, the
Committee envisions a significantly upgraded disclosure regime with mandatory annual
information form filings at prospectus-level disclosure, and with material change
disclosure being raised to the same standard.</P>

<BR><H3>The TSE Initiative</H3>

<P>The TSE's initiative to establish a Committee to address the issue of continuous
disclosure grew out of complaints from investors, responses to the TSE's regular
surveys of institutions on their confidence in the market, and the experience of the
TSE's own staff in dealing with disclosure issues, all of which revealed a level of
concern about the timeliness and thoroughness of ongoing disclosure by public
companies. Many of these concerns arose when companies were faced with financial
distress or other "bad news" situations.</P>

<P>For the TSE, with its cornerstone policy that all persons investing in securities
listed on the Exchange should have equal access to information, the fundamental issue
was whether there are practical and cost-efficient ways to improve continuous
disclosure that will increase the credibility of the TSE market?</P>

<P>Continuous disclosure is defined by the Committee to include all documents that public
companies are required to send to their shareholders, documents that they are required
to file with securities regulators, documents that they voluntarily send to their
shareholders and oral statements. All of these documents and statements inform markets
and constitute a continuous flow of information about the company to investors.</P>

<BR><H3>Committee's Process</H3>

<P>The interim report follows a consultative process which included commissioned surveys,
multiple hearings, and a myriad of briefs and presentations from members of the
financial community, including its regulators, in Canada, the United States and the
United Kingdom.</P>

<P>As part of the process retail investors were asked for their opinion of the timeliness
of disclosure. Nearly 70% indicated that they believed that companies release positive
information in a timely manner almost all or most of the time. Their opinion as to the
timely release of negative information differed markedly. More than 65% indicated that
companies release negative information in a timely manner only some of the time or
almost never. Only 3% believed that negative information is released in a timely manner
almost all the time. Nearly 90% of the analysts surveyed responded that disclosure was
better in the United States.</P>

<BR><H3>Underlying Conclusions of the Committee</H3>

<P>In its interim report, the Committee states its belief not only that there is a
perception that problems exist with the adequacy of disclosure, but that there is
evidence of a significant number of incidents of non-compliance with disclosure
requirements. Its fundamental conclusions, upon which its extensive set of
recommendations are based, are:
<UL>
<LI>There is a sufficient degree of non-compliance with the current continuous
disclosure rules in Canada to cause concern.
<BR><BR><LI>The current sanctions and funding available to regulators charged with the task of
monitoring and enforcing compliance with Canada's continuous disclosure rules are
inadequate.
<BR><BR><LI>The remedies available to investors in secondary trading markets who are injured by
misleading disclosure are so difficul to pursue and to establish that they are, as a
practical matter, largely academic.
<BR><BR><LI>Civil liability should attach to issuers and others for their continuous disclosure
to investors in secondary markets, subject to reasonable limitations.
<BR><BR><LI>In designing recommendations for improvement in disclosure, the balance should be
struck in favour of strengthened deterrence rather than creating a route to meaningful
compensation of injured investors. The belief of the majority was that effective
deterrence should reduce the need for investor compensation.

<BR><BR><LI>The rules by which class actions are conducted in those provinces where class
actions are permitted are sufficiently different from those in the United States. There
is no practical risk that the establishment of statutory civil liability in Canada will
give rise to "strike suit" litigation in Canada comparable to that in the United
States.

<BR><BR><LI>The cost to Canada's capital markets of implementing the Committee's
recommendations, while impossible to quantify, was felt to be warranted and will be at
least counter-balanced by the gains arising from enhanced credibility of disclosure by
issuers accessing Canada's capital markets, and their resulting reduced cost of
capital. Providing full, accurate and timely information to the investment community is
an acceptable cost of accessing one of the world's most efficient capital markets.
</UL>

<BR><H3>Next Steps, Future Actions</H3>

<P>In embarking on the direction it took, the Committee was frank enough to admit that
concerns from issuers - legitimate concerns - were to be expected.
Nevertheless, because of what it viewed to be a material degree of non-compliance, it
concluded that a new deterrence based model, with penalties large enough to get
corporate Canada's attention, was warranted.</P>

<P>In issuing the interim report, the TSE's Board of Governors has not adopted a position
on the merits of either the conclusions reached or the recommendations made by the
Committee. Like the Committee itself, the immediate objective is to stimulate informed
debate and reaction. The interim report is open for comment until late Spring
(originally until March, but now extended at least until April) when Committee members
will begin preparing a final version to be ready for summer.</P>

<BR><H3>Comparisons with the United States</H3>

<P>Interestingly, the TSE Committee's recommendations that civil liability should be
broadened for continuous disclosure breaches were made public less than two weeks
before passage by the U.S. Congress of contrversial legislation designed to reduce the
mountain of frivolous securities litigation which had become a feature of the U.S.
corporate landscape.</P>

<P>Vetoed by President Clinton, who was overridden by both the House and the Senate, the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 is part of the "common sense"
law reforms which were included in the Republican's Contract with America.
Opponents of the law, including President Clinton, fear that it goes too far and will
immunize corporate America against making false statements designed to bolster stock
prices and protect corporate officers employment.</P>

<P>Its proponents regard the Act as an essential constraint in the face of abusive
contingent fee class actions (so-called "strike suits") which are often filed within
hours of a drop in a company's stock price and are based on the fact that corporate
predictions have not been realized. The main features of the new law are:
<UL>
<LI>creation of a safe harbour for forward-looking statements, which must be labelled
expressly and accompanied by "meaningful cautionary statements" identifying important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially;
<BR><BR><LI>class action procedure reforms, including tough plaintiff certification
requirements and restrictions on professional plaintiffs;
<BR><BR><LI>where fraud is alleged, a requirement for plaintiffs to plead specific facts which
give rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent;
<BR><BR><LI>replacement of the old joint and several liability rule with "fair share"
proportionate liability for non-knowing breaches of the securities laws; and
<BR><BR><LI>a two-way cost rule, requiring the losing plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs if
a suit is found to have been frivolous - a daunting risk to contingent fee counsel and
nominal plaintiffs.
</UL></P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2>THE RECOMMENDATIONS</H2></CENTER>
<BR><H3>A Statutory Civil Liability Scheme</H3>

1. &nbsp; Who should have a cause of action?
<UL><LI>any person who acquires or disposes of a security of an issuer in a secondary
market transaction during the period between the date when misleading disclosure was
made and the date when it was corrected, or, in the case of untimely disclosure,
between the date when the disclosure ought to have been made and the date when it was
in fact made.</UL>

2. &nbsp; What disclsure should companies be liable for?
<UL><LI>all documents filed, or required to be filed, with a Securities Regulatory
Authority (an "SRA");
<BR><BR><LI>any other document, such as a press release, voluntarily issued by the company, the
contents of which may reasonably be foreseen as likely to affect the market price of a
security;
<BR><BR><LI>any statement, made by a person with actual, implied or apparent authority to speak
on behalf of a company, made publicly, or privately under circumstances where the
making of such statement might reasonably be foreseen as likely to affect the market
price of a security; and 
<BR><BR><LI>any statement made by a controlling person, promoter or director or officer of the
controlling person or promoter, about a corporation with respect to which the
controlling or promoting relationship exists.
</UL>
3. &nbsp; Should the general level of disclosure be improved?
<UL>
<LI>Yes. All public companies should be obliged to file annually an Annual Information
Form ("AIF") that meets prospectus disclosure standards.
<BR><BR><LI>Material change disclosure should also be upgraded to prospectus disclosure
standards.
</UL><DL><DT>
4. &nbsp; Who should be liable for misleading disclosure<DD>(disclosure that is late, or that
contains a misrepresentation)?</DL>
<UL>
<LI>the issuer;
<BR><BR><LI>each director of the issuer;
<BR><BR><LI>the CEO of the issuer;
<BR><BR><LI>any other officer of the issuer who actively participates in the decision to
publish the disclosure, or in the preparation of the portion of the disclosure
containing the misrepresentation, or in the decision to delay disclosure beyond the
time when it should have been published;
<BR><BR><LI>
any officer of he issuer who, because of such person's position with the issuer, should
reasonably have been expected to have actively participated in such decision or
preparation;
<BR><BR><LI>any controlling person or promoter, or director or officer of a controlling person
or promoter, who knowingly influenced the issuer, or any of its directors or officers
(a) to publish the disclosure in question and who was also aware, or ought reasonably
to have been aware, that the disclosure in question contained a misrepresentation; or
(b) to delay publishing the disclosure in question beyond the time when it ought to
have been published and who was aware, or ought reasonably to have been aware, that the
delay caused the disclosure to be made later than it should have been made;
<BR><BR><LI>
experts, with respect to reports, opinions or statements attributed to them; and
<BR><BR><LI>
influential persons, that is, any director or officer of a controlling person or
promoter who makes disclosure containing a misrepresentation, or any controlling person
or promoter (if the person who made the misrepresentation was a director or officer of
the controlling person or promoter and another director or officer thereof authorized
or acquiesced in the misrepresentation) and any director or officer of the issuer,
controlling person or promoter who authorized or acquiesced in the
misrepresentation.
</UL>
5. &nbsp; What should the nature of the liability be?
<UL>
<LI>Liability should not be joint and several but should be in proportion to the
relative fault of each defendant.
<BR><BR><LI>However, any defendant who knowingly was responsible for a misrepresentation or
delay would be jointly and severally liable with all other such defendants.
</UL>
6. &nbsp; What should the burden of proof be and what defences should be available?
<UL>
<LI>Plaintiffs should not be obliged to prove that they read the misrepresentation or
that they relied upon the misrepresentation in making their investment decision.
Reliance should be deemed to have occurred. With respect to delayed disclosure,
reliance upon the continuous disclosure record being up to date should also be deemed
to have occurred.
<BR><BR><LI>No person, including the issuer, should be liable if that person establishes that the
plaintiff traded with knowledge of the misrepresentation or of the undisclosed
information.
<BR><BR><LI>No person, including the issuer, should be liable if that person satisfies, under all
the circumstances, a "due diligence" defence and if that person was not aware that
there was a misrepresentation or a requirement to disclose the information in question
before it was disclosed.
<BR><BR><LI>No outside director (a director who is not an officer) should be liable for any	
misrepresentation (other than a misrepresentation in core documents - AIF, management
proxy circular, annual and quarterly financial statements, MD&A) or for any delay in
disclosure, unless the director was either aware of the misrepresentation or delay or
was reckless in authorizing or permitting the disclosure or delay to occur.
<BR><BR><LI>No person, other than the issuer, should be liable for any misrepresentation or delay
in disclosure if the document or statement containing the misrepresentation was issued
without his or her knowledge or consent and if, on becoming aware of the
misrepresentation or the delay, the person gave reasonable general notice thereof.
<BR><BR><LI>Experts should have available the same defences, as to expertised portions of
disclosure documents, as they do in connection with expertised parts of a
prospectus.
<BR><BR><LI>These defences go beyond the defences available in connection with prospectus
liability in important respects. First, it is recommended that the due diligence
defence be extended to the issuer. The Committee does not believe that the issuer
should be liable for damages if the officers acted with due diligence. Second, the
Committee does not wish to give rise to a greater degree of outside director
participation in continuous disclosure documents (other than core documents referred to
above). Thus, outside directors should only be held to a recklessness standard for such
documents, not to a due diligence standard.
</UL>
7. &nbsp; Should special provision be made to encourage forward-looking
information?
<UL>
<LI>The Committee believes it is important not to stifle forward-looking information.
Such information will, by its very nature, often prove inaccurate, but if it is
genuinely beleved by management to be a probable prediction of the company's prospects,
liability should not attach to it, provided it is accompanied by cautionary language
and, where the nature of the forward-looking information makes it reasonably
practicable to do so, a sensitivity analysis outlining the effect of variations in key
assumptions.
</UL>
8. &nbsp; How should damages be calculated?
<UL>
<LI>The Committee would not oblige plaintiffs to trade in securities in order to
crystallize the amount of their damages. To do so would place pressure on the buy or
sell side of the market and exacerbate the damages for which defendants are potentially
liable. Accordingly, while plaintiffs are clearly free to trade, their damages would be
limited to the lesser of:
<BR><BR><LI>their actual damages; and
<BR><BR><LI>the difference between the price at which they purchased or sold securities during the
period of misleading disclosure and a "benchmark price" that will be determined as
the weighted average trading price of the securities in question over the ten trading
days after disclosure is corrected, or in such other fashion as a court deems
appropriate in the circumstances.
</UL>

<P>9. &nbsp; Should liability for damages be unlimited?</P>

<P>It is unnecessary to expose defendants to unlimited liability in order to accomplish
the goal of effective deterrence. The Committee believes that the goal of compensating
injured investors must be balanced against the goal of permitting corporations to
continue in business as an important part of the communities in which they operate and
as an important part of the Canadian economy. It is recommended that:
<UL>
<LI>the total liability of an issuer for a particular misrepresentation should not
exceed the greater of $1 million and 5% of its market capitalization calculated prior
to the date of the misrepresentation or delay in disclosure.
<BR><BR><LI>the liability of an officer or director of the issuer should, unless such person
proceeded knowingly, be limited in respect of a particular misrepresentation or delay
to the greater of $25,000 and 50% of such person's total compensation from the issuer
and its affiliates during the preceding 12 months, including the fair market value of
options, potential pension benefits and other deferred compensation held at the time of
the misrepresentation or disclosure delay; and
<BR><BR><LI>the liability of an expert should, unless such expert proceeded knowingly, be
limited in respect of a particular misrepresentation to the greater of $1 million and
three times the fees earned by such expert from the issuer and its affiliates during
the preceding 12 months.
</UL>

<BR><H3>Ontario Securities Commission</H3>

<P>The Committee recommends that the user-pay system currently in force be permitted to
function without diversion of funds so that the Commission is adequately funded. It
believes that the current situation in which the Ontario Securities Commission finds itself,
where it is a source of net revenue to the Ontario government and yet is said to have
inadequate funding to perform the task that the capital markets expect of it, and which
its legislative mandate imposes upon it, cannot be permitted to continue.</P>

<BR><H3>Market Participant Advisory Committee</H3>

<P>The Committee recommends that a committee be established to represent the private
sector to provide advice, when asked and on its own initiative, to the SRAs with
respect to continuous disclosure rules, to comment on disclosure expectations of the
investment community, and to identify and alert the SRAs to disclosure violations and
inadequacies. Such a committee, to be designated the Market Participant Advisory
Committee, should be broadly constituted and be composed of representatives of private
and public sector pension funds, mutual fund managers and investment counsellors,
Canadian societies of financial analysts, The Canadian Institute of Chartered
Accountants, the Canadian Shareowners Association (or other comparable organizations),
and Canadian university faculties.</P>

<BR><H3>Integrated Disclosure System</H3>

<P>The Committee recommends that the quality of disclosure be upgraded significantly by
stipulating that every public company/reporting issuer be obliged to file an annual information form, the content of
which would be obliged to meet prospectus-level disclosure. Further, material change
disclosure should also satisfy prospectus-level disclosure. Finally, SRAs should
consider moving toward a system in which all reporting issuers are eligible to use the
POP system. In view of the recommendation that corporations and management be liable to
injured third parties for misleading continuous disclosure, the Committee was of the
view that selected scrutiny of documents by SRAs would be sufficient.</P>

<BR><H3>Analyst Meetings</H3>

<P>The Committee recommends that issuers adopt the practice of holding information
meetings quarterly, after their quarterly report has been published, such meetings to
be notified in advance and to be available to all analysts.</P>

<BR><H3>Educational Programs</H3>

<P>The Committee recommends that the Exchange take a greater role in the education of
issuers and their officers with respect to the practical application of continuous
disclosure rules. Specifically, the Exchange should develop educational programs, to be
held at regular intervals, aimed at improving awareness of and compliance with
continuous disclosure obligations and that the Exchange publish semi-annually a "TSE
Speaks" publication dealing with disclosure failures by listed companies as well as
disclosure dilemmas that have been faced, together with the resolution of those
dilemmas by collaboration between the issuer and the staff of the Exchange.</P>

<H2>Reforming The Canada Business Corporations Act:<BR>Our Update on Phase II</H2>

<P>The <I>Canada Business Corporations Act</I> ("CBCA") was a state-of-the-art business corporations statute
when it became law in 1975. But the Act has not kept pace with new developments, and the time was
right for a much-needed overhaul when Industry Canada last year commenced a two-phase process for
updating and reforming the CBCA, which governs 190,000 Canadian companies.</P>

<P>The 1994 Phase I amendments involved mostly technical reforms intended to reduce red tape, resolve
ambiguities and contribute to the efficient administration of the Act. The more ambitious Phase II
initiative, now well under way, will lead to reommendations from the Minister to Parliament for far
more substantive changes to the Act. Over the coming months the Phase II consultations will be the
subject of significant public discussion and should be closely monitored by those in the corporate
community whose interests might be affected. This bulletin describes the more important issues on the
reform agenda.</P>

<P><B>The Consultation Process</B><BR>
Industry Canada and the Corporations Directorate have identified the following key issues for the
Phase II reform initiative:
<UL>
<LI>shareholder communications and proxy solicitation;
<LI>going-private transactions;
<LI>directors' residency and other corporate residency requirements;
<LI>various "technical amendments";
<LI>unanimous shareholder agreements;
<LI>directors' liability;
<LI>financial assistance to shareholders, officers and others; 
<LI>insider trading; and
<LI>takeover bids.
</UL></P>

<P>The discussion papers and business consultation questionnaires on these issues are being released in
stages through to December, 1995 and Industry Canada's public consultations will commence shortly
thereafter. Written responses to the background papers and questionnaires should be in the
government's hands by March, 1996.</P>

<P>In addition, the Senate Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, chaired by Senator Michael
Kirby, will hold hearings in Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Halifax, and Montreal in February, 1996
seeking input on the discussion papers and related issues of corporate governance.</P>

<P>The target date for draft legislation is the fall of 1996 with final passage of the amending package
scheduled for the spring of 1997.</P><BR>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>The Issues</B></FONT></P>

<P><B>Shareholder Communications</B><BR>
The Industry Canada discussion paper raises a number of important issues relating to communications
from corporations to their shareholders and by shareholders to each other. With most shares now held
through brokers or other intermediaries, identifying and communicating with non-registered beneficial
shareholders is still slow, expensive and uncertain. Issuers find they cannot communicate directly
with their beneficial shareholders on topics of vital interest to the corporation's future; and
shareholders who want to exchange views with other shareholders can find themselves stymied by the
need to comply with complex and sometimes onerous proxy solicitation rules. Adding to the problems
are the proliferation of new financial products and the increasing use of borrowed shares. </P>

<P>The Canadian Securities Commissioners' National Policy 41 ("NP 41") adopted by most provincial
regulators addresses some of the issues relating to communications between issuers and their
non-objecting beneficial owners ("NOBOs"), but it currently is under revision with no final consensus
yet having been reached.</P>

<P>The Industry Canada paper suggests a number of possible solutions, including requiring registrants to
furnish NOBO lists to issuers on request, harmonizing the CBCA with NP 41 (in its draft amended
form), adopting fixed record dates for voting shares, changing the timing for notices of annual
meetings, adopting new rules for voting borrowed shares and implementing various means of direct
communication with NOBOs. </P>

<P>As for communications among shareholders, the paper follows the lead of recent U.S. SEC reforms that
exempt from the dissident proxy solicitation rules communications by shareholders whose ownership
interests fall below certain thresholds and those who wish to state in the media how they will vote
without soliciting proxies. Industry Canada's final views on these issues will presumably have to
await finalization of NP 41.</P>

<P><B>Going Private Transactions</B><BR>
Going-private transactions (or "GPTs") refer to a variety of techniques designed to eliminate
minority shareholder interests with compensation, but without the consent of all those who are
affected. GPTs can enhance corporate efficiency and streamline decision making; but there i
resistance to these kinds of transactions in the investment community. </P>

<P>Unlike Ontario's <I>Business Corporations Act</I> , the CBCA does not expressly permit GPTs (except for "90%
squeezeouts" under s. 206), but there is a 1994 policy statement by the CBCA Director explaining that
GPTs are permitted so long as fairness is assured, with the s. 241 oppression remedy providing the
yardstick. </P>

<P>The discussion paper recommends that the CBCA codify the 1994 Director's policy by expressly
permitting GPTs in certain circumstances so long as the acquiror abides by standards of fairness,
which would be prescribed by regulation. Leaving the fairness standards to the "regs" rather than
enshrining them in the Act would balance the need for certainty and predictability against the need
for flexibility as standards evolve. The paper does not recommend specific standards, but suggests
that three protections mandated by most provincial securities rules  approval by a majority of the
minority, independent valuations and enhanced disclosure  would likely be a base minimum. To protect
minority shareholders of private companies, the proposals would hold an acquiror to public company
standards or require unanimous shareholder consent.</P>

<P><B>Directors' Residency</B><BR>
Under the CBCA a majority of the board and its committees must be resident Canadians, and directors
may not transact business at board meetings unless such a majority is present. These requirements
were adopted in the 1970's in response to nationalistic concerns that foreign direct investors would
not adequately take into account Canadian interests.</P>

<P>The residency requirements may have outlived their usefulness. They have been criticized for limiting
board flexibility, discouraging foreign investment and inhibiting Canadian owned transnational
corporations from accessing the international board expertise they need to compete effectively in
world markets. Most other OECD jurisdictions that had such policies have long since abandoned them.
Moreover, a corporation can easily avoid the requirements by incorporating in one of the four
provinces that do not have such constraints, by using a unanimous shareholder agreement that strips
all but token powers from the board or by various other means. </P>


<P>The Industry Canada paper considers ten possible options for reform ranging from maintaining the
status quo to repealing the directors' residency requirements altogether, but requiring an agent for
service of legal documents.</P>

<P><B>Technical Amendments</B><BR>
Under the heading "Technical Amendments" Industry Canada has assembled a diverse grab-bag of
proposals, some of which raise important substantive issues that might otherwise warrant full
discussion papers. Among the more important are:
<UL>
<LI>whether a subsidiary should be permitted to acquire shares in its parent;
<LI>whether beneficial (but unregistered) shareholders should be permitted to submit  shareholder
proposals;
<LI>whether meetings that may be requisitioned by shareholders be restricted to      matters within the
powers of shareholders;
<LI>how directors should be permitted to appoint additional directors between        shareholders'
meetings; 
<LI>the range of matters that may be delegated by directors; and
<LI>strengthening auditors' rights to information.</UL></P>

<P><B>Directors' Liability</B><BR>
Discussion concerning directors' liability, especially under federal and provincial statutes, has
mushroomed in recent years. Some commentators have suggested that easing the burden on directors
would encourage more qualified people to participate in the governance of Canadian corporations.
While Industry Canada will be looking at this possibility, it is also considering various ways to
expand liability. For example, the adequacy of the current "good faith" reliance defence in s. 123(4)
is being questioned and the imposition of a more stringent "full due diligence" standard is being
considered. Industry Canada is also looking at expanding the requirement for the disclosure of
conflicts of interest and at clarifying the indemification and insurance provisions. </P>

<P>The issue of broadening the scope of the board's duty from acting in the best interests of
shareholders as a whole to acting in the best interests of other stakeholders as well is not
expressly on the reform agenda, but it will likely become a subject of discussion during the
consultation period. 
One directors' liability issue, which for jurisdictional reasons cannot be entirely resolved by the
federal government but still deserves close study, is the proliferation of federal and provincial
statutory provisions that impose personal criminal and civil liability on directors for acts and
omissions of the corporation in such areas as environmental law, taxation, occupational health and
safety, pay equity and a large number of others. There are at least 200 such statutes, and the TSE
Committee on Corporate Governance in Canada  recently urged the review of this growing body of
legislation.</P>

<P><B>Insider Trading</B><BR>
The most straightforward insider trading reform option would be the harmonization of federal
provisions with provincial securities regulations. While harmonization is on the table, Industry
Canada is also looking at updating the definition of insider, extending the limitation period for
civil actions from two to three years, adding to the list of speculative instruments that insiders
are prohibited from trading in, facilitating the compensation of investors at whose expense an
insider trade takes place, and establishing a reporting period by regulation. Insider trading
proposals that go beyond "de facto" harmonization with provincial standards are likely to encounter
significant resistance.</P>

<P><B>Takeover Bids</B><BR>
As with insider trading, any consideration of takeover bids will have to take place against a
backdrop of provincial securities laws and stock exchange rules. The issues Industry Canada is
considering include raising the bid threshold from 10 to 20 %, introducing new rules for issuer bids,
requiring that bid materials be sent to non-residents, clarifying the duties of a target company's
directors, creating new rules for changing the terms of a bid, updating several exemptions and giving
the CBCA Director the power to exempt specific transactions.</P>

<P><B>Unanimous Shareholder Agreements</B><BR>
For closely-held corporations (which make up 99% of the CBCA's companies) the most significant Phase
II issue may well be the possible expansion of the unanimous shareholder agreement provisions that
permit shareholders to assume some or all of the powers of the board. Industry Canada has studied a
report prepared by McMillan Binch which recommends that provisions similar to recent U.S. legislation
be enacted to give shareholders of private companies the flexibility to contract out of provisions in
the governing statute and allow them to better shape their corporate legal form to their business
needs and internal relationships.</P>

<P>Expanding the unanimous shareholder agreement provisions would be consistent with the government's
deregulation and small and medium business agendas: it would help small businesses, joint venture
corporations and the wholly-owned subsidiaries of large public companies to develop more flexible and
responsive organizational structures and avoid unnecessary formalities. </P>

<P><B>Financial Assistance</B><BR>
The complex restrictions in s. 44 of the CBCA on a corporation's ability to provide financial
assistance by way of loans, guarantees or other means to its shareholders, directors, officers and
other related parties, or in connection with purchases of its shares, have been often criticized for
hindering effective corporate reorganizations and throwing up needless roadblocks to intra-group
financings. The statutory language raises a host of interpretive problems; the policy behind the
prohibitions is obscure; and prac-titioners are often driven to dubious avoidance techniques before
they will bless otherwise blameless transactions. </P>

<P>Industry Canada is considering various alternatives, including the Alberta Law Reform Institute's
recommendation to simply repeal the equivalent provisions in the Alberta statute, and the recent
amendments in Saskatchewan that substituted disclosure requirements for solvency and asset value
tests. Other alternatives include narrowing the reach of the section, simplifying its wording and
fine tuning the standards for its application. </P>

<P><B>Conclusion</B><BR>
In addition to updating the substance of the CBCA, the reform initiative may also point the way to
more responsive and flexible ways to keep the Act more current and in some greater measure of harmony
with provincial securities laws. It is too early to tell just how far reaching the Phase II
legislation will be, but those with an interest in the reform issues should review the discussion
papers in the coming months and make their views known to Industry Canada or the Senate Finance
Committee.</P>

<H2>Bata Directors Win On Environmental Indemnification</H2>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Introduction</B></FONT><BR>
On September 18, 1995, the Ontario Court of Appeal wrote the final chapter of the legal
saga of Bata Industries. The case involved the release of chemical wastes from the Bata
shoe manufacturing facility in Batawa, Ontario. Since the trial in 1992, it has driven
directors' liabilities and environmental matters to the top of every corporate agenda.
One doubts that Bata will be sad to see its name disappear from Canadian law reports.</P>

<BR><P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Background</B></FONT><BR>
Bata Industries Ltd. and two of its directors were found guilty of offences under
Ontario's environmental statutes. The charges related to the storage of liquid wastes
generated by the manufacturing facility. Bata stored the wastes for a long period of
time in an exposed area so that the metal drums rusted or corroded and eventually
deteriorated to the point where the wastes spilled. The court said this was negligent.</P>

<P>Ontario's environmental legislation imposes an obligation on corporate directors and
officers to take all reasonable care to prevent a discharge of pollutants. Two of the
directors, Douglas Marchant and Keith Weston, were charged with breaching the
<I>Environmental Protection Act&nbsp;</I> in their capacity as Bata directors, and were found
guilty. The directors knew about, or should have known about the problem. Either way,
they failed to address it diligently. The trial court sentenced each director to a fine
of $12,000, which was reduced on appeal to $6,000 each.</P>

<P>The court also issued a probation order against Bata that tried to prevent the
corporation from indemnifying the individual defendants. After an appeal before an
intermediate court, Bata appealed a single issue  - the validity of this probation
order - to the Court of Appeal.</P>

<UL>
<LI>In Ontario, probation orders are authorized by the <I>Provincial Offences Act&nbsp;</I>. They
are deemed to contain standard conditions including one that the defendant not commit
the same or any related or similar offence. 
<LI>The Court of Appeal indicated probation terms are rooted "in deterrence and the
rehabilitation of the defendant."
<LI>The Court of Appeal found the indemnification prohibition improper because, although
by its terms it bound the corporate defendant, Bata Industries, it was in substance
aimed at the individual directors.
<LI>The probation order was used against Bata for a collateral purpose - to ensure that
two other parties not subject to the order were punished correctly by receiving no
indemnification.
<LI>The Court of Appeal referred to the indemnification provisions in the Ontario <I>Business
Corporations Act&nbsp;</I> which sets out the circumstances under which a corporation may
indemnify directors or officers and the narrower circumstances when a corporation must
indemnify them. The Court of Appeal stated that the indemnification provisions
constitute a:

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"comprehensive code of general application by which the indemnification of
officers and directors and former officers and directors is regulated."&nbsp;</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>If Bata was to be prohibited from indemnifying the directors, the Court of Appeal
said that the prohibition should be contained in the <I>Business Corporations Act&nbsp;</I>, not
imposed by virtue of a probation order under the <I>Provincial Offences Act&nbsp;</I>. 
<LI>According to the Business Corporations Act, indemnification is permitted if the
directors acted honestly, in good faith, and in a reasonable belief that their conduct
was lawful. If the directors failed to meet these requirements, the probation order is
superfluous because the law prevents Bata from indemnifying them. If they did act
honestly, the probation order contradicts the scheme set out in the <I>Business
Corporations Act&nbsp;</I>.
<LI>The Court of Appeal held that it was not appropriate to impose a term of probation
that denies directors access to general legislation concerning indemnification, like
the <I>Business Corporations Act&nbsp;</I>.
</UL>

<P>The bottom line is that directors can rest easier, knowing that - if they meet the
legal standards of acting honestly, in good faith and believing they were acting
lawfully - corporations will not be prohibited from indemnifying them.</P>

<H2>Appeal Rights Under the Ontario EPA - A Short Fuse!</H2>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>A Trap for the Unwary</B></FONT><BR>
Environmental regulation in Ontario involves a great deal of bureaucratic discretion.
Specific emission levels or pollution controls are often found in a certificate of
approval or an order issued to an individual plant or facility by the Ministry of
Environment and Energy (MOEE) rather than in a statute or regulation which applies to
everyone. The result of the certificate of approval, or order, is site-specific
regulation. This may give bureaucrats more flexibility than a province-wide scheme but
it also opens the door to decisions by local regulators that can be inconsistent or
downright arbitrary. If you get such an order or approval, you do have a right to
appeal under Ontario's <I>Environmental Protection Act&nbsp;</I> but the time permitted for
exercising those rights is so tight that the opportunity is frequently lost. To avoid
losing your rights, you mustbe prepared for a very short fuse. </P>

<BR><P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The MOEE's Tool-Kit</B></FONT><BR>
If you apply for a certificate of approval for pollution control or abatement measures,
the certificate you receive will generally come with a long list of conditions
attached. Orders are issued by the Ministry to compel an action that the subject will
not do willingly - they too can have strings attached in the form of terms and
conditions. In the past, the Ministry issued such orders only occasionally, since it
has preferred to achieve pollution abate- ment through negotiation. When it did
exercise this power, its own internal processes were cumbersome and grindingly slow.
But a recent policy decision to use an accelerated version called a "field order" will
result in more frequent resort to the use of orders. </P>

<BR><P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Environmental Appeal Board</B></FONT><BR>
You can generally appeal an MOEE order or approval to the Environmental Appeal Board
(EAB). Ontario's <I>Environmental Protection Act&nbsp;</I> set up the EAB to deal with the nuts and
bolts of environmental regulation. It hears appeals involving orders, certificates of
approval, licenses and permits under Ontario's environmental legislation. The EAB may
be the only protection against an arbitrary call by the MOEE. </P>

<P>As a specialist administrative tribunal, its members are chosen for their expertise in
various environmental disciplines. In some ways, it is more powerful than a court since
it has the power to alter, revoke or confirm the action of the MOEE. But  as discussed
below, the EAB is powerless if the person appealing misses the 15 day cut-off.</P>

<BR><P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>What Can Be Appealed?</B></FONT><BR>
If you are an applicant for an approval or a person to whom an order is directed, you
can appeal on matters such as:
<UL>
<LI>a refusal to issue or renew a certificate of approval or permit;
<LI>the imposition of particular terms or conditions in a certificate of approval or
permit
<LI>the revocation or suspension of a certificate of approval;
<LI>the imposition of an order or a specific portion of an order;</P>
</UL>
<P>The EAB has a general power to order the MOEE to take whatever action the EAB considers
appropriate. In effect, it can overrule the MOEE on large strategy or on the small
details of environmental regulation. </P>

<BR><P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Appeal Period</B></FONT><BR>
Unfortunately, the time frame for appeal is ridiculously short - only 15 days from the
date when you are served with the certificate, order, or permit. When manufacturers
change equipment or even alter rates of production, the Ministry requires them to amend
or update certificates of approval. The MOEE Approvals Branch knows all about the magic
of the 15 day period. They are careful in issuing new or amended certificates of
approval not to reopen contentious issues that are already locked in by the lapsing of
the 15 day period previously. </P>

<P>It is not complicated to launch an appeal. The details are generally provided by the
MOEE when they deliver the approval documents. Simply fill in a notice of appeal form
setting out the details of the approval or order that you object to. Then serve the
form on the MOEE and the EAB.</P>

<P>But subject to one minor exception, your right to appeal is completely lost if you do
not act within 15 days. In one reported case, the EAB concluded it could not extend the
15 days, even where there was an obvious injustice and where the MOEE was happy to
consent to an extension.</P>


<BR><P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Protecting Your Interests</B></FONT><BR>
In some cases, where the MOEE proposes to isue an order, it must give a written notice
of its intentions to the parties involved. A business receiving such a notice has time
to respond and has an effective warning of what may occur. But a "field order" will not
generally be preceded by notice and the recipient has only 15 days to make its appeal. </P>

<P>Likewise, the approvals process does not lend itself to strict time delays. Despite
recent improvements, an application for an approval can sit with the Approvals Branch
for several months. Where an applicant for approval has heard nothing about its request
after a three month period, it is natural to regard the certificate of approval as
something that is less than pressing. </P>

<P>Where there is a problem with a particular MOEE approval,  legal counsel is frequently
consulted after - in many cases long after - the expiry of the time period. All too
often legal counsel are asked to correct a problem in a certificate of approval three
and even six months after it is issued. Generally, the technical experts have wrestled
with it for a month or so before confirming to themselves that it needs to be
rectified. </P>

<P>Environmental managers must be aware of the 15 day period. They should be ready to move
swiftly to review an approval or order as soon as it is issued and to decide
immediately if it is acceptable. If it may be problematic, consult your legal advisers
without delay. You can file a notice of appeal while further studies are performed.</P>

<P>The time and expense involved in preparing a notice of appeal is not large. Filing the
notice of appeal is not a commitment to ongoing expense. You can negotiate with the
MOEE and abandon an appeal at any time. But if the initial step isn't taken, you are
stuck with the order or approval for good.</P>

<FONT SIZE="+3"><B>Nova Scotia Unlimcos:</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><B>A Planning Opportunity for Cross Border Leasing</B></FONT>

<P>Unlimited liability companies (Unlimcos) incorporated in Nova Scotia are becoming increasingly popular
as a vehicle in structuring cross-border leasing transactions. As a hybrid entity that may be
considered a corporation for Canadian tax and corporate law purposes and as a partnership for U.S. tax
purposes, Unlimcos can serve a useful purpose in the role of lessor in leasing transactions involving
a U.S. equity investor and a Canadian lessee.</P>

<BR><H3>Overcoming the Withholding Tax Hurdle</H3>

<P>Historically, the major hurdle to be overcome in structuring a lease into Canada has been, and
continues to be, the Canadian withholding tax that would be payable by the Canadian lessee on lease
payments to a non-resident lessor. Inbound leasing transactions have been difficult to structure, and
the few that have been done have generally relied on complex two-tiered "converter structures"
involving a lease outside Canada followed by a conditional sale into Canada. Except for the airline
industry which was successful in persuading the Department of Finance to exempt aircraft lease
payments from Canadian withholding tax, most other industries that are users of capital equipment are
faced with this hurdle. Canadian railways, for example, have for the most part been limited to
domestic leases when seeking lease financing for the acquisition of rolling stock.</P>

<P>Unlimcos may open the door forinbound leases from the United States and provide Canadian companies
with access to the U.S. leasing market. This development could result in lower lease rates for
Canadian companies able to conclude cross-border leasing transactions that take advantage of U.S. tax
benefits which may be available to the owner/lessor of certain types of equipment.</P>

<P>How do Unlimcos accomplish this objective? &nbsp;By virtue of the hybrid nature of the entity. If an
Unlimco is the owner/lessor of the leased assets, Canadian withholding tax becomes a non-issue since
the lease payments pass from a Canadian lessee to a Canadian lessor (Unlimco) without crossing the
border. However, for U.S. tax purposes, the Unlimco lessor may qualify as a partnership thereby
entitling the U.S. members to flow-through treatment. A U.S. equity investor that becomes a member of
an Unlimco lessor may, subject to the "Pickle-Dole" rules in the U.S. for foreign use property, obtain
favourable tax treatment as a partnership that is akin to the tax treatment it could have obtained if
the lessor were a U.S. entity. Alternatively, a U.S. equity investor could incorporate an Unlimco into
a "leasehold interest" structure in lieu of the more traditional U.S. leveraged leasing structure.</P>

<BR><H3>Establishing an Unlimco</H3>

<P>Unlimcos are not "off-the-shelf" corporations and must be tailored to each transaction. Structuring a
suitable Unlimco requires careful attention to the Unlimco's charter documents in order to meet the
objectives of U.S. tax counsel, provide for bankruptcy remoteness given the special purpose nature of
the entity, and comply with Nova Scotia corporate law. Once the form of the charter documents has been
settled, it is a simple matter for Nova Scotia counsel to establish the Unlimco by filing the
necessary documents in the ordinary course with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies. Nova Scotia is
the only jurisdiction in Canada which allows the incorporation of Unlimcos.</P>

<P>In structuring the Unlimco lessor, U.S. tax counsel will be guided by U.S. tax rules that provide an
association will be taxed as a "corporation" if it satisfies any three of four tests. In order to
avoid being characterized as a corporation, the Canadian entity must "fail" at least two of the
following tests:  limited liability; shares freely transferable; centralized management; and unlimited
life. It is possible to structure an Unlimco in a leasing transaction so it fails three and perhaps
all of the tests set out by the IRS. The resulting flow-through treatment as a partnership would
enable a U.S. equity investor to claim favourable U.S. tax benefits. Part of these tax benefits may,
subject to negotiation between the parties, be passed back to the Canadian lessee.</P>

<BR><H3>Dealing with Unlimited Liability</H3>

<P>As unlimited liability is not a particularly attractive feature to potential investors, a limited
liability entity may be interposed as a buffer between the U.S. equity investor and the Unlimco. Such
a buffer with limited liability would preclude a creditor, who must first exhaust its recourse against
the Unlimco before proceeding against its members, from pursuing the U.S. equity investor. Limited
liability protection can be achieved without sacrificing the investor's access to U.S. tax benefits by
using a corporation that is consolidated with the investor for U.S. tax purposes, or by using a
limited partnership or limited liability company structured as a flow-through vehicle for U.S. tax
purposes.</P>

<P>Certain other aspects of Nova Scotia company law may make the incorporation of an Unlimco attractive
to U.S. investors. Unlike the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) which requires that a majority of
directors be resident Canadians, the Companies Act (Nova Scotia) imposes no such restriction on the
composition of an Unlimco's board of directors.</P>

<BR><H3>Canadian Tax Considerations</H3>

<P>Although withholding tax on lease payments is addressed through the use of an Unlimco in a cross
border lease, there are other Canadian taxes to be considered. As a full-fledged Canadian taxpayer,
the Unlimco is taxed as a corporation in Canada and would be required to file Canadian income tax
returns as would any other Canadian corporation. It would also have to be operated with a view to
profit, and may not be structured to "run flat" as would most other special purpose entities. The
deductions that would be available to an Unlimco in computing its taxable income may not be sufficient
to offset the leasing income earned by it, thereby causing the Unlimco to incur Canadian income tax
liability, particularly in the later years of the lease when the interest expense on its indebtedness
may be lower than in the early years.</P>

<P>Like other corporations, the Unlimco would also be subject to liability for federal large corporations
tax on its' taxable capital employed in Canada. It may also be subject to provincial capital taxes,
although Nova Scotia does not at present impose such taxes on non-financial institutions and the
Unlimco's liability for such taxes in other provinces would depend on the nature of its assets, the
manner in which it conducts its business and the specific rules applicable in the other relevant
provinces.</P>

<P>Canadian withholding tax on payments by the Unlimco in respect of interest and dividends should also
be considered. In a leveraged leasing transaction, when the debt is provided by a U.S. lender, the
interest paid by the Unlimco to te U.S. lender may attract Canadian withholding tax unless the debt is
structured in a manner that qualifies for the long-term debt exemption set out in section
212(1)(b)(vii) of the <I>Income Tax Act</I>. Dividend payments made by Unlimco to its U.S. members would
attract Canadian withholding tax, but generally the preferential treaty rate of 5% (6% in 1996) would
apply.</P>

<BR><H3>Providing for Sufficient Canadian Dollars</H3>

<P>Currency exchange risk is another risk to be considered in structuring a cross-border lease involving
an Unlimco when the lease payments and/or debt funding are payable in U.S. dollars. Care must be taken
to address the hedging or funding of any cash shortfalls that may arise as a result of mismatches in
the tax characterization of currency gains or losses or the potential insufficiency of cash receipts
to fund obligations that may be denominated in another currency. The U.S. equity investor may be
required to fund any shortfall in Canadian dollars.</P>

<BR><H3>Protecting Against Lessor Insolvency</H3>

<P>A Canadian lessee involved in a lease with an Unlimco would be concerned that the special purpose
nature of the lessor be maintained throughout the lease term and that the lessor be contractually
restricted from undertaking any activities apart from the single leasing transaction. Such
restrictions, which may also be included in the Unlimco's charter documents, are intended to reduce
the risk of a lessor insolvency. In order to secure its option to purchase the leased equipment from
Unlimco at the end of the lease, the lessee may also take security over the equipment. As there would
be no other assets in Unlimco apart from the leased equipment, the lessee may also require certain
covenants from the U.S. equity investor, such as a covenant that all Canadian taxes incurred by
Unlimco will be paid.</P>

<P>In summary, the Unlimco is a hybrid entity that provides a unique planning opportunity to Canadian
lessees interested in seeking U.S. lease financing for their equipment. When properly structured, an
Unlimco could facilitate a domestic leasing transaction that has many of the features and benefits of
a U.S. leveraged lease. A carefully designed economic model would be required in order to ensure that
the cash flows in the leasing transaction meet the tax and financial objectives of the parties on both
sides of the border.</P>

<P>The foregoing is for general informational purposes only and is not to be considered as legal advice
on matters of Nova Scotia or U.S. law. Readers are cautioned that counsel in those jurisdictions
should be consulted when establishing an Unlimco.</P>

<H2>Government Procurement Rules have Teeth</H2>

<P>Our International Trade and Commodity Tax Group recently achieved precedent setting
success when the Canadian International Trade Tribunal recommended that an unsuccessful
bidder to a federal government contract be compensated for its profit opportunity lost
as a result of a breach of the NAFTA Government Procurement Rules by a federal government
Department.  The amount of compensation is currently being negotiated and is in the
millionsof dollars.</P>

<P>We determined that the NAFTA Rules applied to the Request for Proposals ("RFP") and
filed a procurement review complaint with the Tribunal pointing out the non-compliant
elements of the awardee's bid proposal and alleging various acts of discrimination
contrary to the NAFTA.  The Tribunal determined that the NAFTA Rules were breached when the
government Department accepted a proposal which, at the time of bid opening, failed to
comply with essential requirements of the RFP.  The Tribunal agreed with our
submissionsthat so called "clarifications" to the awardee's bid after bid opening amounted to
substantive modifications, revisions or alterations of the contents of the bid proposal in respect
of a number of essential requirements in the RFP.</P>

<P>The Tribunal therefore recommended that the contract with the awardee be terminated and
awarded to the Complainant or, in the alternative, that compensation be paid "that
recognizes the prejudice suffered by the Complainant in being deprived of the contract and of the
opportunity to profit therefrom."   The Tribunal also awarded the Complainant its costs
in bringing the complaint and, if the contract was not awarded to the Complainant, its
reasonable costs incurred in preparing the bid.</P>

<P>In addition to the precedent setting nature and amount of the compensation award, the
case also establishes principles to be applied when a government entity does not play by the
new NAFTA Procurement Rules.  These Rules force the federal government to change the way it
does business; a government entity cannot steer bids and cannot work with a
non-compliant preferred bidder to modify the bid proposal to an acceptable level of compliancy.  </P>

<P>Unsuccessful bidders in federal government tenders should consider seeking redress
under the NAFTA regarding unfair or non-competitive bidding practices.  A complaint must be filed
with the CITT within 10 working days after the day on which the basis for the complaint
became known or reasonably should have become known.  Dalton Albrecht (416) 865-7171
or Cyndee Todgham (416) 865-7125 can be contacted for more information.</P>

<H1>The Emergence of Electronic Commerce:<BR>When is a Deal Really a Deal?*</H1>

<P><I>Disputes arising from electronic commerce are getting piecemeal responses. But the very nature of the
media calls for concerted action on an international scale.</I><BR><B>By David Woolford and Simon Chester</B></P>

<P>In today's business environment, technologies are evolving at a dazzling rate. Every day busnesses
conduct a vast number of commercial transactions that crisscross the globe. Each transaction
has at least one common element: the communication of information. Historically, communication was
either direct (typically face-to-face or over the telephone), or via the postal or other personal
delivery systems. Telex communication started over 50 years ago but grew increasingly obsolete as
fax technology spread. Today, more and more businesses are using electronic data interchange (EDI)
and electronic mail (e-mail) to communicate. With the burgeoning use and popularity of the Internet,
these types of communication are exponentially increasing in number.</P>

<P>Yet, save for a few recent cases and some legislative developments, the challenge raised by new
technology to the legal principles governing contract has not been settled. The global marketplace
needs clear legal ground rules, and the issues raised will have to be addressed. When exactly, for
example, is a deal really a deal? If a deal does exist, when and where is it made? Which
jurisdiction's laws will govern, especially where parties in different jurisdictions use third party
network service providers (VANs) located elsewhere?</P>

<P>To appreciate the questions raised by the new technologies, their impact on other issues surrounding
the construction and enforcement of binding contracts, and 
where the law is and ought to be going, an understanding 
of the origins and development of the common law principles applicable to business commerce is
useful.</P>
<BR>
<H2>Binding agreements</H2>

<P>Whether a court will enforce an agreement as a contract depends on whether the agreement satisfies a
number of well-established legal requirements: 
<UL>
<LI>the parties must intend to create legal relationships; 
<LI>there must be communication between the parties of both a valid offer and a valid acceptance;
<LI>each party must either confer a benefit on the other party or incur a detriment (consideration); and 
<LI>the agreement may have to comply with certain formal requirements (such as writing and signature)
imposed by whatever jurisdiction will regulate disputes under the contract (governing law).
</UL>
The first and third requirements for a valid contract are largely unaffected by the parties' choice
of communication medium. But, in this electronic age, the question of whether or not an offer or an
acceptance has been made can be problematic. The use of a non-print medium also poses problems for
the formal requirements.</P>

<P>Commercial transactions made or altered by use of the technologies of the 1990s -<I>fax, EDI and e-mail&nbsp;</I>
- also raise questions regarding contract formation and enforceability that courts will
increasingly have to grapple with. Consideration must be given to: 
<UL>
<LI>Do the new media work?
<LI>How should risk be allocated if communications accepting or revoking a deal are not received or
are otherwise problematic?
<LI>When and where was the contract formed?
<LI>What is the governing law of the contract?
</UL>
<BR>
<H2>Methods of Communication</H2>

<H3>The Traditional View</H3>

<P>Common law courts have long accepted that the general course of business between parties will
determine how acceptance of a contractual offer is to be communicated or delivered, unless the
contract or a particular statute provides otherwise. The common law <I>postal rule&nbsp;</I> developed alongside the
postal services in the 19th century: an offer sent to an individual by post implicitly authorized an
acceptance by mail unless there was express language to the contrary. In the early years of this
century common law courts made similar leaps of faith where offers were communicated by cable or
telex.</P>

<P>However, the technologies of the 1990s have yet to be definitively endorsed by the courts. Legal
history of technological evolution could supply a precedent to endorse these new communications, but
whether this will be accepted is far from certain. And while the courts may imply consent to use such
technologies from a history of similar communications between the parties, the law has no clear
response to a situation where a party employs a new medium to deliver an acceptance, for example,
acceptance by e-mail, where traditionally all dealings were made by fax.</P>
<BR>
<H3>Facsimile Transmissions</H3>

<P>It is only recently that Canadian courts have had to deal with questions of facsimile technology -
the smattering of cases contrasts sharply with the pervasiveness of the fax machine itself.
Nevertheless, it seems to be accepted that fax is a permitted medium of communication unless
expressly forbidden. The key issue here is to determine whether and when a party receives a faxed
document. A party wanting to challenge the validity of a faxed communication cannot simply allege
that the communication should have been made by an alternative medium, since Canadian case law would
validate the communication of an offer or acceptance by fax (so long as it is received by the other
party) on the grounds that it is as convenient a method of communication as any other. This will
probably be the outcome even when a faxed offer or acceptance flows from contractual arrangements
that date from times before facsimile technology existed or was even imagined. Contractual changes
made by facsimile transmissions will also be valid if the court concludes that the parties so
intended.</P>
<BR>
<H3>EDI & E-mail Transmissions</H3>

<P>Canadian courts have not yet considered the legal validity of commerce conducted by EDI and e-mail
technologies. They are still relatively new, and civil disputes generally take a considerable time
to reach the courts. Perhaps the issues have not been litigated because potential litigants feel that
any benefit from a clear legal endorsement of the medium will likely be outweighed by the damage
to the business relationship. The potential litigants probably settle the issue pragmatically and get
back to business.</P>

<P>Although the lack of case law has meant that some of the core issues are still in theory open,
several things suggest that the EDI and e-mail technology will be endorsed. Chief among these is the
enthusiasm shown in recent Canadian cases for new technologies in general. A comment from the bench
typifies the trend:

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"The conduct of business has for many years been enhanced by technology improvements in
communication. Those improvements should not be rejected automatically when attempts are made to
apply them to matters involving thelaw. They should be considered and, unless there are compelling reasons for
rejection, they should be encouraged, applied and approved."</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

Other arguments in favour of the validity of these technologies relate more to the practicalities of
commerce than to innate legal principles. The sheer scale, frequency and commercial importance of
transactions using these devices is growing daily. The courts recognize that if they impose some
overly technical or restrictive condition, parliament would inevitably be forced to overturn it,
perhaps almost immediately.</P>

<P>If parties customarily transfer data electronically, they will have consented to the use of the
technology. But parties who want to restructure their commercial relationships to take advantage of
the benefits that accrue from the use of electronic commerce would be well 
advised to enter into a trading partner agreement. Such an agreement should include a declaration
that the parties recognize the validity of EDI and e-mail transmissions and consent to their use as
valid communication media.</P>
<BR>
<H3>Allocating Risk</H3>

<P>Parties using new technological media need to think about who should bear the risk if there are
problems with communication, and who should be responsible for confirming receipt of an acceptance.
Under the postal rule, acceptance will be effective as soon as it is mailed, whether the offeror
receives it or not. The rule rests on the notion that the offeror is in the best position to know
whether there may have been a miscommunication.</P>

<P>The rules for allocating risks for telex transmissions, first laid out by Lord Denning some 40 years
ago, are based on a similar rationale but lead to a different result. The offeree generally knows
whether there has been a problem in communication and so should bear the burden of ensuring a
successful delivery of its acceptance.</P>

<P>A party sending a message by telex can generally tell if that message has or has not been received by
the other party's machine, and so the onus of ensuring reception has not been problematic.
However, where a sender reasonably believes that an acceptance has been successfully sent but the
intended recipient is blissfully unaware of this, the courts have held that no contact arises.
Similarly, if the offeree is unaware that the offeror has revoked the deal, the revocation will be
unsuccessful. But where a message has been received but is garbled or incomplete as a result of some
system failure, the couts have shifted the onus of asking for the message to be repeated onto the
recipient. Failure to request a repeat will give rise to an estoppel should the receiver later claim
non-communication of acceptance or revocation.</P>

<P>These principles would appear to be compatible with fax, EDI and e-mail technologies. As some
observers have noted, risk allocation rests on theories of agency and contract law rather than on the
characteristics of individual technology. The result may change based on the medium used but the
process of analysis is the same. Nevertheless, parties should stipulate in their general trading
agreement which party will bear the risks in transmission. This is especially important where third
party network service providers are employed to facilitate or effect transmission.</P>
<BR>
<H2>When and Where is a Deal Made?</H2>

<P>These questions are most pertinent when contracting parties are in different jurisdictions. The
common law rule is that acceptance is understood as a final and unqualified expression of assent
which must be communicated to the offeror. The postal rule shifts this slightly, since an acceptance is
deemed to be received - and a contract thus created - at the time and place of posting. The
rationale is that the offeror has made the post office its agent.</P>

<P>The prevailing commonwealth case law on telex transmissions, in recognizing that the technology
affords  virtually instantaneous communication, has held that a contract is formed at the place where the
acceptance is received. The timing of such reception - hence the precise point in time when a
contract arises - is not always so clear. Some courts have concluded that it is not unreasonable to
consider an acceptance received when it reaches the offeror's address, even if that is out of
working hours and no one will see it at the time of delivery. Commonwealth courts, however, appear
resolved that no general rule should apply in all cases.</P>

<P>American courts have taken a very different position. They consider that a contract formed using
instantaneous media is created at the time the acceptance was sent and at the place from which it
was sent (i.e. an extension of the postal rule).</P>

<P>Few cases have considered when and where an acceptance communicated by fax is deemed received. The
prevailing authority, which is Australian, holds that a facsimile acceptance is deemed received
when it reaches the recipient's address, even if it can be proved tht nobody was there to receive it.
This sounds straight forward but opens up an alarming spectre of liability. In light of this, it
would be prudent to include in the offer words stipulating when it will be deemed received if sent by
fax, or expressly prohibiting acceptance by this mode of communication.</P>

<P>While there were more than 65,000 EDI users in the United States and Canada by the end of 1993,
little case law exists on when and where contracts created by this medium arise. In light of the
similarities with fax technology, in particular the speed of delivery, it can plausibly be argued
that an acceptance will be deemed received (and a contract deemed to arise) at the place where it was
received, either at the time of reception or at a reasonable time thereafter.</P>
<BR>
<H3>A U.S. Example</H3>

<P>In the United States, one case analysed what could be held to constitute an acceptance where a
transmission acknowledge- ment of receipt is made automatically by a computer. It concluded that this
kind of functional communication did not amount to an acceptance creating a contract. It merely
confirmed reception without the receiver consciously considering its contents.</P>

<P>This U.S. case seems to fit the Commonwealth legal principle that the time of reception should not
always be deemed to be the time of acceptance. Nonetheless, trading agreement partners should
stipulate when acceptances will be deemed received.</P>
<BR>
<H2>Conflict of Law Issues</H2>

<P>Parties located in different legal systems will face problems as to which system will or should
determine whether a contract is legally binding. In the past, courts applied rigid principles which
determined the appropriate law of a contract largely by formal reference to such factors as the
place of contracting, the place of performance and the nationality of the parties. Today's common
law rules governing conflict of law are more flexible. In essence, the rule now is that questions of
form and substance should be resolved by the proper law of the contract. Courts have held this to
be the law of the jurisdiction by which the parties expressly provide that the contract be governed
or, in the absence of such an expression, the legal system with which the transaction has its
closest and most real connection.</P>

<P>This rule is intended to protect parties from having to comply with particular requirements of a legal
system with which they have no intrinsic connection but which has merely been, for example, the
location of the transmission or reception of their acceptance.</P>

<P>The freedom to choose a jurisdiction is qualified by common law rules requiring that the choice be
<I>bona fide&nbsp;</I>, legal and not contrary to public policy in the sense of having been deliberately made to
avoid an otherwise applicable rule. In practice, there are few problems.</P>

<P>These rules are flexible enough to deal with deemed place and time of contracting for electronic
commerce. Where the jurisdiction is not specified, these issues can be especially problematic in
contracts between Canadian and U.S. parties because of the different positions their national courts
have taken on the deemed place of contracting by the use of instantaneous communication
technology. Equally problematic are situations where contracting parties employ a third party
outside the jurisdictions concerned in order to facilitate transmission.</P>

<P>The courts resolve the conflicts of law issues by considering the jurisdiction with the most
substantial links, or nexus, to the contract. Thanks to the Internet, electronic transmissions,
particularly e-mail messages, are now regularly routed around the world through jurisdictions which
have nothing to do with the transactions. So, in the absence of an express governing law clause,
the place where the contract is to be performed (rather than the place of contracting) is likely to
be the factor that courts will focus on to resolve the question of proper law. The best advice,
however, is for contracting parties to establish a governing law clause in their trading partner
agreement.</P>
<BR>
<H2>Formal Requirements</H2>

<P>Despite being otherwise valid under the governing law, certain types of contracts must also satisfy
formal requirements in order to be binding. They must, for example, be in writing and signed.
Electronic commerce, due to its inherent non-print characteristics, is laying these requirements open
to close and novel scrutiny.</P>

<BR>
<H3>Written Contracts</H3>

<P>When parliament passed the Statute of Frauds in 1677, it could hardly have dreamt that the writing
requirement would be difficult. This statute provided that no action could be brought in respect of
certain defined types of contracts (such as contracts of guarantee and agreements relating to land,
or not to be performed within one year) unless there was a note or memorandum of the agreement.
Sale of goods acts and consumer protection legislation also have provisions imposing a writing
requirement on contracts in excess of specified monetary amounts.</P>

<P>Over the past 300 years, courts have cut back this writing requirement by holding that the writing
need neither be in any particular form nor contemporaneous 
with the formation of the contract. (Thus, a computer printout of a contract containing elec-tronic
signatures may be just as valid as one written by hand in ink on a piece of paper.)</P>

<P>The emergence of electronic commerce has further strained this formality. At the least, we may need
to expand the definition of what constitutes a writing. Perhaps we should abandon the principle
entirely. And, whether the courts exp
and the definition or legislatures do away with the writing requirement may simply turn on who gets
to the issue first.</P>

<P>Some legislatures have taken the initiative by expanding the direction of the term writing and
eliminating the instances where a written contract is necessary. In the United States, the Uniform
Commercial Code (UCC) definition in Article 1-201 has been amended to expressly include faxed
documents. The Vienna International Sale of Goods Convention settled as long as ago as 1980 that
international sales contracts need not be concluded in writing or have any formal requirements. The
UK Copyright Act contains an expansive definition accepting any notation, regardless of the medium
on which it is recorded. Interpretation statutes in Canada define the term <I>writing&nbsp;</I> as words recorded
in a medium that is visible in form. This would seem to cover a faxed document. Ontario has
recently passed a <I>Statute Law Amendment Act&nbsp;</I> doing away with the writing requirement in the province's
Sale of Goods Act for contracts over Cdn.$40 (U.S.$29). The same amending legislation eliminated
the writing requirement in Ontario's Statute of Frauds for contracts not to be performed within one
year.</P>

<P>In Canada, the enforceability of faxed contracts appears settled in light of the meaning ascribed to
the term <I>writing&nbsp;</I>. But the status of purely electronic (ie. paperless) forms of communication is
still open. Lawmakers are starting to grapple with this surging phenomenon. Meanwhile, parties
should safeguard enforceability by stipulating within their trading partner agreements that
electronic transmissions are writings.</P>
<BR>
<H3>Signed Contracts</H3>

<P>Certain types of contracts need to be signed to be valid. But, as with writing requirements, courts
are interpreting this more loosely. Two core factors emerge. The signature r its symbolic
equivalent must be capable of establishing an evidential link to the signatory and they must signify
approval of the contents of the contract. A recent UK decision held that an automated answer-back
from receiver to sender would not be regarded as a signature because, though it authenticated the
document, it did not convey approval of its contents.</P>

<P>At the moment, EDI and e-mail contracts may present problems because of the difficulty in
independently verifying or establishing the evidential nexus to the signatory. Accordingly, trading
partner
agreements should oblige the parties to establish specific electronic identification or
authenticating numbers or codes, and to agree that these signs are legally sufficient to verify the
identity
of the sender of an electronically-transmitted document and satisfy any statutory signature
requirements.</P>

<P>Industry groups are working on developing a standard means of authenticating electronic messages.
These are expected to use encription-key security features to prevent documents being tampered with
or signatures being forged.</P>
<BR>
<H2>International Standards</H2>

<P>Legislative change and the growing use of electronic trading partner agreements are spurring on legal
change. But they are only the start. As electronic commerce becomes more prevalent so too will
disputes which can be justly resolved only by adapting legal principle. The law will also have to
face up to issues that go beyond contract issues, such as how electronic transmission will be
regarded as evidence and what happens if each party believes that their standard form governs a
transaction. Different countries are starting to address all these issues. The real challenge is to
establish a regime that is consistent with internationally accepted standards and fair and certain to
contracting parties while at the same time fostering - or at least not inhibiting or
discouraging - the business use of new technologies as they develop. The future of cost-effective
electronic commerce demands nothing less.</P>

</P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><P><UL><LI><A HREF="http://seamless.seamless.com/rcl/iplaw/playb2.html" > The Internet Law Page: Playboy Enterprises, Inc., v. Frena</A><LI><A HREF="http://www.jmls.edu/cyber/cases/frena.txt" > Playboy Enterprises, Inc., v. Frena 839 F.Supp.1552 (M.D.Fla.1993)
</A></UL></P>
<P></P>
<P></P> 
<P><P>
FACTS<BR>

<P>
&#183; Frena operated a subscription computer
bulletin board service, Techs Warehouse BBS, that distributed
unauthorized copies of Playboy Enterprises, Inc.'s copyrighted
photographs.
<P>
&#183; 170 of the images were available on
BBS were copied from Playboy's copyrighted materials.
<P>
&#183; No dispute that Playboy owns the copyrights
on the photos in question.
<P>
&#183; Frena admits that every one of the accused
images is substantially similar to the Playboy copyrighted photos
from which the accused image was produced.
<P>
&#183; Infringing photos are essentially exact
copies; only difference is that Playboy's written text appearing
on the same page of the photo has been removed from the infringing
copy.<BR>

<P>
HELD<BR>

<P>
&#183; Playboy succeeded on all points (copyright
infringement, trademark infringement and unfair competition) granted.
<BR>

<P>
REASONING<BR>

<P>
&#183; Frena argued that it was &quot;fair
use&quot; to mount the pictures, but the court did not accept
the argument;
<P>
&#183; his use was clearly commercial;
<P>
&#183; the photos were entertainment;
<P>
&#183; the photos copied an essential part
of Playboy's publication; 
<P>
&#183; the copying would have an adverse impact
on Playboy's potential market;
<P>
&#183; Playboy's registered trademarks, PLAYBOY
and PLAYMATE were used to identify many of the files containing
the photographs;
<P>
&#183; Court found that the marks were strong
enough and distinctive enough to deserve the highest degree of
protection under the Trademark Act of 1946;
<P>
&#183; High likelihood of confusion;
<P>
&#183; Frena used Playboy's name and logo to
benefit from Playboy's reputation.
<P>
&#183; Frena falsely suggested that Playboy
had authorized his product.
<P>
&#183; Removal of Playboy's trademarks from
the photos constitutes &quot;reverse passing off&quot;<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1><P><UL><LI> PEINET Inc. v. OBrien (1995) 61 C.P.R. (3d) 334 MacDonald C.J.T.D. http://jilt.law.strath.ac.uk/elj/jilt/Confs/Amsterdm.htm</UL></P>
<P></P>
<P></P> 
<P><P>
Facts
<P>
&#183; PEINET asked the court to stop O'Brien
from using the Internet domain name &quot;PEI.NET&quot; because
it resembled its company name, PEINET INC. 
<P>
&#183; PEINET INC. provided regional access
to the Internet under the domain name, &quot;peinet.pe.ca.&quot;

<P>
&#183; Mr. O'Brien, was an employee of PEINET
INC. until his dismissal in 1994.
<P>
&#183; After being fired, he set up his own
business as an Internet service provider under the name &quot;Island
Services Network&quot;.
<P>
&#183; Mr. O'Brien obtained the domain name
&quot;PEI.NET&quot; (in upper-case letters) from a U.S. Internet
service provider. He later had it changed to &quot;isn.net.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
Issue
<P>
&#183; PEINET claimed O'Brien was &quot;passing-off&quot;
his work as his won. <BR>

<P>
Decision
<P>
&#183; The court dismissed the claim.<BR>

<P>
Reasoning
<P>
&#183; The PEINET name was unlikely to be confused
with PEINET because:
<P>
(i) PEINET used upper-case letters for its
company name, whereas O'Brien's domain name was in lower-case
letters.
<P>
(ii) PEINET INC. did not separate PEI and the
word NET with a period.<BR>

<P>
&#183; The court thought that PEINET's arguments
were superficial; even if it had proved that O'Brien's use of
the domain name &quot;pei.net&quot; infringed the name PEINET
INC., it failed to establish the elements of a passing-off action:
the existence of goodwill, deception of the public due to a misrepresentation,
and actual or potential damage.
<P>
&#183; MacDonald C.J.T.D. concluded that &quot;[b]asically
all that O'Brien did was, for a very short period of time, use
a &quot;telephone&quot; number that was the same as PEINET's name.&quot;
The use consisted of a reference to it in a newspaper article
and a listing on Internet for a very short period of time.

<P></P>
<P></P> 
<P><P>
Facts
<P>
&#183; Carnetta Wong Associates (&quot;CWA&quot;)
registered the domain name &quot;avon.com&quot;.
<P>
&#183; Avon accused Wong of unfair competition,
trademark infringement, misappropriation, trademark dilution,
and deceptive acts and practices. 
<P>
&#183; The suit marked the first action under
the new U.S. Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995. Previously,
dilution was available only as a state law remedy in 25 states.
<P>
&#183; Under the new legislation, dilution
is defined as &quot;the lessening of the capacity of a famous
mark to identify and distinguish goods or services, regardless
of the presence or absence of (1) competition between the owner
of the famous mark and other parties, or (2) likelihood of confusion,
mistake or deception.&quot;
<P>
&#183; According to Avon, CWA had no intention
of using the site commercially; it merely hoped to force Avon
to pay for the use of the domain name. 
<P>
&#183; After Avon complained, Network Solutions
Inc. (&quot;NSI&quot;) intervened and cancelled CWA's registration.
<BR>

<P>
Decision
<P>
&#183; A court decision over the measures of
damages for trademark dilution and infringement is still pending.

<P></P>
<P></P> 
<P><P>
FACTS
<P>
&#183; Patterson, a lawyer who lives in Houston,
Texas has a business called FlashPoint Development; subscribed
to CompuServe system where he advertised his computer software
(a program to help people navigate around the Internet) for sale
<P>
&#183; CompuServe began to market a similar
product with markings and names that Patterson thought similar
to his own (i.e. WinNAV, Windows Navigator, FlashPoint Windows
Navigator); Patterson claimed common law trademarks in these
<P>
&#183; CompuServe changed the name of its programs,
but Patterson continued to complain.
<P>
&#183; Patterson demanded $100,000 to settle.
<P>
&#183; CompuServe then asked the federal district
court for the Southern District of Ohio for a ruling that it had
not infringed any common law trademarks of Patterson or FlashPoint
Development, and that it was not otherwise guilty of unfair or
deceptive trade practices.
<P>
&#183; Patterson responded that an Ohio court
had no jurisdiction over him.
<P>
&#183; The District court agreed and dismissed
the action.<BR>

<P>
ISSUE
<P>
&#183; Did CompuServe show that Patterson's
contacts with Ohio, which have been almost entirely electronic
in nature, are sufficient to ground an Ohio court's jurisdiction
over him?<BR>
<BR>

<P>
HELD
<P>
&#183; CompuServe won an appeal, and the case
was returned to a lower court for further proceedings.
<P>
&#183; The dispute did not arise directly out
of Patterson's user agreement with CompuServe, and Patterson did
not otherwise have sufficient contacts with Ohio to justify asserting
jurisdiction.<BR>

<P>
REASONING
<P>
&#183; To determine whether personal jurisdiction
exists over a defendant, federal courts apply the law of the forum
state, subject to the limits of the Due Process Clause.
<P>
&#183; To determine as to whether the non-resident
defendant has sufficient contacts with the forum state that the
district court's exercise of jurisdiction would comport with &quot;traditional
notions of fair play and substantial justice&quot;, the court
looks to 3 criteria:<BR>

<P>
1. The defendant must purposefully avail himself
of the privilege of acting in the forum state or causing a consequence
in the forum state.
<P>
2. The cause of action must arise from the
defendant's activities there.
<P>
3. The acts of the defendant or consequences
caused by the defendant must have a substantial enough connection
with the forum to make the exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant
reasonable.<BR>

<P>
&#183; Patterson has knowingly made an effort,
and purposefully contracted to market a product in other states,
with Ohio-based CompuServe operating, in effect, as his distribution
center. Thus, it is reasonable to subject Patterson to suit in
Ohio, the state which is home to the computer network service
he chose to employ.<BR>

<P>
. The &quot;legal&quot; requirement save satisfied
when the defendant's contacts with the forum state proximately
result from actions by the defendant himself that create a substantial
connection with the forum State, and when the defendant's conduct
and connection with the forum are such that he should reasonably
anticipate being hauled into court here. The law does not require
the defendant to be physically present in the forum state.<BR>

<P>
&#183; Once Patterson had subscribed to CompuServe
and entered into the Shareware Registration Agreement, he was
on notice that his contracts would be governed by Ohio law.
<P>
&#183; Ohio has written and interpreted its
long-arm statute, and particularly its &quot;transacting business&quot;
subsection, with the intent of reaching as far as the Due Process
Clause will allow.
<P>
&#183; Patterson also &quot;originated and
maintained&quot; contacts with Ohio when he believed that CompuServe's
competing product unlawfully infringed on his own software.
<P>
&#183; Patterson knowingly reached out to CompuServe's
Ohio home, and he benefited from CompuServe's handling of his
software and the fees that it generated.<BR>

<P>
. If a defendant's contacts with the forum
state are related to the operative facts of the controversy, then
an action will be deemed to have arisen from those contacts.
<P>
&#183; Patterson's contacts with Ohio are certainly
related to the operative facts of the controversy; he placed his
software on CompuServe's Ohio-based system; he used that system
to advertise his software and sell it; the proceeds of those sales
flowed to him through Ohio; no one disputed that Patterson placed,
marketed, and sold his software ONLY on Ohio-based CompuServe.

FACTS<BR>

<P>
&#183; Small Missouri jazz club called &quot;The
Blue Note&quot; had a site on the Net. Information about the Missouri
club was available to New Yorkers on the Internet The Blue Note
in Greenwich Village, a legendary jazz venue, sued the Missouri
club of the same name for allegedly &quot;selling or promoting&quot;
an infringing product.<BR>

<P>
HELD<BR>

<P>
&#183; The court said it did not have to hear
the case.<BR>

<P>
REASONING
<P>
&#183; Because ticket information and tickets
for the Missouri club must be obtained in Missouri and the club
did not &quot;purposefully direct&quot; its Internet pitch at
New Yorkers, assertions of jurisdiction under New York's long-arm
statute fail.
<P>
&#183; The mere fact that a person can gain
information on the allegedly infringing product is not the equivalent
of a person advertising, promoting, selling or otherwise making
an effort to target its product in New York.
<P>
&#183; Court found that because Missouri club
reports 99 percent of its patronage and revenue from local residents,
there was no reasonable expectation of New York damage stemming
from the information on the Web site.<BR>

</P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><P><UL><LI><A HREF="http://www.jmls.edu/cyber/cases/pres-kap.txt" > Pres-Kap, Inc. v. System One, Direct Access, Inc.  (June 21, 1994) (District Court of Appeal of Florida, 3rd District)</UL></A></P>
<P></P>
<P></P> 
<P><P>
FACTS<BR>

<P>
&#183; Pres-Kap is a Delaware subsidiary of
Eastern Airlines. It owns and operates a computerized airline
reservation system; the computer base for this system, as well
as the billing and main business office, is located in Miami,
Florida; Pres-Kap also maintains a branch business office in New
York City.
<P>
&#183; System One operates a travel agency
in Rockland County, New York; all its travel business is conducted
out of that office.
<P>
&#183; Pres-Kap, through its NY office, made
a deal to provide airline reservations to System One. All of the
contracts (including earlier ones with Eastern Airlines) were
made in New York. 
<P>
&#183; When equipment supplied under the contract
malfunctioned, System One contacted NY office but got no response;
it stopped making lease payments and so Pres-Kap sued.
<P>
&#183; The travel agency's contact with Florida
was very limited: (1) it forwarded all rental payments to the
Pres-Kap's billing office in Miami; (2) the computer database
which it accessed through computer terminals, is located in Miami.
<BR>

<P>
ISSUE<BR>

<P>
&#183; Appeal by a non-resident defendant corporation
from a non-final order denying its motion to dismiss a breach
contract action for lack of personal jurisdiction over it.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
HELD<BR>

<P>
&#183; The appeal court held it could not exercise
jurisdiction over a non-resident.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
REASONING<BR>

<P>
&#183; In order for a state court to subject
a nonresident defendant to a personal jurisdiction judgment, due
process requires that the nonresident defendant have certain minimum
contacts with the forum state so that bringing the action does
not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.
<P>
&#183; The minimal contacts could not convert
an obviously New York-based transaction into a Florida transaction
so that the travel agent could reasonably expect to be sued.
<P>
&#183; The travel agency did not even know
the exact electronic location of the computer database.
<P>
&#183; Even if such knowledge had been shown,
this would not have altered the travel agent's reasonable expectation
that New York courts would handle any dispute between the parties.
<P>
&#183; Any other decision would have far-reaching
implications for business and professional people who use &quot;on-line&quot;
computer services for which payments are made to out-of-state
companies where the database is located; such a result would be
beyond the reasonable expectations of such computer-information
users, and would offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial
justice.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1><P><UL><LI><A HREF="http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/home.html" > Religious Technology Center v. Netcom On-Line Communication Services Inc.	(1995) (U.S. Dist. Ct.) Whyte J.
</A></P></UL>
<P></P>
<P></P> 
<P><P>
Facts
<P>
&#183; Religious Technology Center (&quot;RTC&quot;)
and Bridge Publications (BP) held copyrights in the unpublished
and published works of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Church
of Scientology.
<P>
&#183; The defendant, Dennis Erlich, was a
former minister of Scientology turned vocal critic of the Church.
He posted criticism of the Church on a discussion group called
alt.religion.scientology.
<P>
&#183; The Church alleged that Erlich infringed
their copyrights when he posted portions of their works on the
discussion group.
<P>
&#183; Erlich's name was revealed in February
1995 when Finnish police in Helsinki presented Johan Helsingius
with a warrant demanding the name of the person who had been using
his anonymous server (anon.penet.fi) to post messages on the discussion.
When he refused, he was told that failure to comply would result
in the confiscation of his system and the identities of all those
who had used his system would be revealed. Rather than put these
people at risk, he divulged Erlich's name. Since then, the anonymous
server has been shut down. 
<P>
&#183; Erlich himself was confronted by police
at his California home. The cops searched his home, confiscated
all magnetic media and deleted files from his hard disk that they
found offensive.
<P>
&#183; The Church ordered BBS operator Tom
Klemesrud and Netcom to cut-off Erlich's access to their systems.
They refused. 
<P>
&#183; Netcom called itself a &quot;passive
transmitter&quot; and claimed it could not control content or
determine whether the millions of daily messages violated copyright.
<P>
&#183; In response, the church cited 1,200
instances in which Netcom cut off subscriber accounts for offensive
messages.
<P>
&#183; The court rejected Netcom's &quot;fair
use&quot; defence in an earlier motion for an interim injunction.
<BR>

<P>
Issues
<P>
&#183; Should BBS operators and Internet access
providers be liable for copyright infringement committed by a
BBS subscriber?<BR>

<P>
Decision
<P>
&#183; The court held that Netcom was not liable
for direct infringement or vicariously liable. The court left
open the issue of contributory liability, but refused to order
Netcom to cut off access. <BR>

<P>
Reasoning<BR>

<P>
Direct Infringement
<P>
&#183; The court found that Netcom did not
take any affirmative action that directly resulted in copying
of Scientology texts. Its software system automatically received,
copied and forwarded messages from subscribers on the Usenet.
Likewise, Klemesrud's system operated without human intervention.
<P>
&#183; The court compared Netcom to a phone
company which would not be liable for carrying an infringing fax
transmission or for storing an infringing audio recording on its
voice-mail.
<P>
&#183; The court held that where a BBS merely
stores and passes along all messages sent by subscribers and others,
it should not be seen as causing the works to be publicly distributed
or displayed.
<P>
&#183; The court expressed concern about expanding
the scope of liability on the Internet when there is already a
party directly liable for causing the copies to be made (i.e.
the user).
<P>
&#183; &quot;The court does not find workable
a theory of infringement that would hold the entire Internet liable
for activities that cannot reasonably be deterred. Billions of
bits of data flow through the Internet and are necessarily stored
on servers throughout the network and it is thus practically impossible
to screen out infringing bits from noninfringing bits.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Vicarious Liability
<P>
&#183; On the facts, Scientology failed to
show the two elements necessary to establish contributory negligence:
the right and the ability to control the infringer and direct
financial gain. The court held that Scientology failed to establish
that Netcom benefited financially from the postings.<BR>

<P>
Contributory Infringement
<P>
&#183; The court left open the issue of contributory
infringement. There was evidence that Netcom knew or should have
known that Erlich was infringing their copyrights after receiving
a letter from Scientology. 
<P>
&#183; There was also evidence that Netcom
exhibited a degree of control and, therefore, had materially contributed
to the &quot;infringing conduct&quot;. The court noted that unlike
a landlord who leases property, Netcom retained some ability over
how its &quot;leased premises&quot; were used.<BR>

<P>
Fair Use 
<P>
&#183; The court considered the purpose and
character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the
portion of the work used and the effect of the use upon the potential
market. The court's biggest concern was whether the use would
effect the potential market. The court was not particularly concerned
about the amount of the work copied in and of itself, since Netcom
was not able to selectively copy portions of the work posted by
Erlich. <BR>

<P>
NOTE: A similar copyright case, pitting Scientology
affiliates against Internet access provider, Gateway Digital Service
Inc., is scheduled for trial in January in the federal court in
Virginia.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1><P><UL><LI><A HREF="http://www.mcbinch.com/netlaw/cubby.html" > Cubby v. CompuServe (1991) No. 90 Civ. 6571 (N.Y. Dist. Ct.).</UL></A></P>
<P></P>
<P></P> 
<P>
<P>
Facts
<P>
&#183; Cubby sued CompuServe for libel, business
disparagement and unfair competition based on allegedly defamatory
statements carried on one of CompuServe's services, Rumorville.
<P>
&#183; Cubby claimed that Rumorville published
false and defamatory statements relating to the computer database,
Skuttlebut - a service designed by Cubby Inc. to compete directly
with Rumorville.
<P>
&#183; Subscribers to CompuServe pay a membership
fee and on-line time usage fees for access to a general on-line
information service and special &quot;forums&quot; comprised of
electronic bulletin boards, interactive on-line conferences and
topical databases.
<P>
&#183; One publication available as part of
CompuServe's Journalism Forum was Rumorville USA. It was managed
by Cameron Communications Inc. (&quot;CCI&quot;) and owned by
Don Fitzpatrick Associates (&quot;DFA&quot;).
<P>
&#183; Under a contract between DFA and CCI,
DFA agreed to accept &quot;total responsibility for the contents&quot;
of Rumorville.
<P>
&#183; CompuServe had no opportunity to review
Rumorville's contents before DFA uploaded it into CompuServe's
computer banks, where it was immediately available to approved
subscribers. 
<P>
&#183; CompuServe did not have notice of any
complaints about the contents of the Rumorville publication or
about DFA until the action was filed.<BR>

<P>
Issue
<P>
&#183; Was CompuServe legally responsible for
materials posted on Rumorville by a third party? <BR>

<P>
Decision
<P>
&#183; The court rejected an argument that
the case could be decided summarily.<BR>

<P>
Reasoning
<P>
&#183; The court concluded that CompuServe
was more akin to a bookstore than a publisher. As a distributor,
it could not be held directly liable because it neither knew nor
had reason to know of the allegedly defamatory statements.
<P>
&#183; Nor was CompuServe vicariously liable.
CompuServe could refuse to carry a given publication, but once
it made the decision to do so, it was limited in its ability to
exert editorial control. In this case, Rumorville was owned and
operated by third parties over which CompuServe had no direct
control. 
<P>
&#183; The claims of business disparagement
and unfair competition were also dismissed because CompuServe
had no knowledge of the harmful statements. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1><P><UL><LI><A HREF="http://www.mcbinch.com/netlaw/prodigy.html" > Stratton Oakmonth v. Prodigy Services Co., 23 Media L. Rep. (BNA) 1794 (1995). </UL></A></P>
<P></P>
<P></P> 
<P>
Facts
<P>
&#183; Stratton Oakmonth, a small brokerage
firm specializing in penny stocks, sued Prodigy for $200 million.
<P>
&#183; A user posted statements on &quot;Money
Talk&quot;, a computer bulletin board service carried by Prodigy,
accusing Stratton and its officers of criminal activity. 
<P>
&#183; According to Prodigy's stated policy,
it was a family-oriented computer network. It held itself out
as an on-line service that exercised editorial control over the
content of messages posted on its computer bulletin boards.
<P>
&#183; Prodigy also had &quot;content guidelines&quot;
which requested users to refrain from posting notes that were
insulting or in bad taste.
<P>
&#183; The service also made use of a software
screening program which automatically prescreened all bulletin
board postings for offensive language.
<P>
&#183; Bulletin board leaders were responsible
for enforcing Prodigy's guidelines. They could remove messages
from boards with the &quot;emergency delete function&quot; and
replace them with explanations for the deletions.
<P>
&#183; Sixty thousand messages were posted
daily on Prodigy's bulletin boards.<BR>

<P>
Issues
<P>
&#183; Was Prodigy a publisher of the statements
on Money Talk?<BR>

<P>
Decision
<P>
&#183; The court granted summary judgment against
Prodigy.<BR>

<P>
Reasoning
<P>
&#183; The court distinguished Cubby on two
grounds: (1) Prodigy held itself out to the public and its members
as controlling the content of its computer bulletin boards; and,
(2) Prodigy implemented this control through its automatic software
screening program and the active use of technology and manpower
to delete offensive notes from its computer bulletin boards.
<P>
&#183; The court concluded, therefore, that
Prodigy was a publisher of the statements of &quot;Money Talk.&quot;
<P>
&#183; The court noted, however, that &quot;[c]omputer
bulletin boards should generally be regarded in the same context
as bookstores libraries and network affiliates.&quot; It emphasized
that it was Prodigy's own policies, technology and staffing decisions
which led to the conclusion that Prodigy was a publisher.<BR>

<P>
NOTE: Stratton agreed in late 1995 to drop
its $200 million action against Prodigy in return for an apology
and an undisclosed settlement. Prodigy failed, however, to persuade
the trial court judge to withdraw his decision. Prodigy has since
filed a motion for reconsideration and, if unsuccessful, may appeal.

<P></P>
<P></P> 
<P><P>
FACTS<BR>

<P>
&#183; The operators of an electronic bulletin
board in California were convicted of having obscene material
on their BBS according to the standards of Memphis, Tennessee.
Robert and Carleen Thomas began operating the Amateur Action Bulletin
Board System (AABBS) from their home in Milpitas, California in
February 1991, which enabled subscribers to download sexually
explicit images and join in chat groups to discuss the materials.
<P>
&#183; The Thomas's' digitized collection reached
approximately 14,000 images, largely gleaned from sexually explicit
magazines (which they scanned to convert the pictures into computer
files); they promoted their service as the &quot;nastiest place
on earth&quot;
<P>
&#183; Customers could also purchase sexually
explicit videotapes, which were requested via e-mail and delivered
using the services of UPS.
<P>
&#183; Access to the files was limited to members
who were given a password after they paid a membership fee and
submitted a signed application form (which included the applicant's
age, address, telephone number and signature).
<P>
&#183; In July 1993, a US Postal Inspector
received complaint regarding the AABBs from an individual who
lived in Memphis, Tennessee; the Inspector assumed an alias and
became a member of AABBS; retrieved information, requested videos
and participated in chat lines.
<P>
&#183; Thomas's' were subsequently charged
on 12 counts, including: conspiracy to violate federal obscenity
laws, knowingly using and causing to be used a facility and means
of interstate commerce - a combined computer/telephone system
- for the purpose of transporting obscene, computer-generated
materials in interstate commerce; shipping obscene videotapes
via U.P.S.; causing the transportation of materials depicting
minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct; and Mr. Thomas alone
was charged with one count of forfeiture .
<P>
&#183; Thomas's were tried in federal district
court in Memphis and convicted of distributing obscene materials
in interstate commerce; Robert Thomas found guilty of all counts
except that dealing with child pornography; Carleen Thomas found
guilty on first 10 counts.<BR>

<P>
APPEAL<BR>

<P>
&#183; Thomas's' appeal decision, arguing,
among other things that the materials they offered were not obscene
by the standards of their own Bay Area community, and wondered
whey they were in court in Memphis.<BR>

<P>
HELD<BR>

<P>
&#183; Robert and Carleen Thomas' convictions
and sentences (37 and 30 months, respectively) affirmed.<BR>

<P>
ISSUES <BR>

<P>
&#183; This case reveals the difficulty of
applying &quot;community standards&quot;, in a world of computer
networks, - the test by which a piece of work is judged obscene,
according to the legal doctrine that the Supreme Court established
in its 1973 decision of Miller v. California.
<P>
&#183; This case is important also because
it considers whose obscenity standards should apply material is
considered indecent. 
<P>
&#183; If material placed on the Internet in
one community can be viewed by anyone in the world, then the question
is by what obscenity standards are they to be judged?<BR>

<P>
REASONING<BR>

<P>
&#183; Prosecutions may be brought either in
the district of dispatch or the district of receipt, where a message
is sent or received. Obscenity is determined by the standards
of either community.
<P>
&#183; It is not unconstitutional to subject
interstate distributors of obscenity to varying community standards
<P>
&#183; If defendants did not wish to subject
themselves to liability in jurisdictions with less tolerant standards
for determining obscenity, they could have refused to give passwords
to members in those districts, thus precluding the risk of liability
<P>
&#183; The computer-generated images and videotapes
involved here betrayed bestiality, incest, rape, sex scenes involving
defalcation, urination etc.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4><DD>"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive
       property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual
       may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is
       divulged, it forces itself into the possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot
       dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the
       less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from
       me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper
       at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from
       one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and
       improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently
       designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space,
       without lessening their density at any point, and like the air in which we breathe,
       move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive
       appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property." -<BR>
       <DD>Thomas Jefferson <P>

<DD>"Throughout the time I've been groping around cyberspace, an immense, unsolved conundrum has
remained at the root of nearly every legal, ethical, governmental, and social vexation to be found in
the Virtual World. I refer to the problem of digitized property. The enigma is this: If our property
can be infinitely reproduced and instantaneously distributed all over the planet without cost,
without our knowledge, without its even leaving our possession, how can we protect it? How are
we going to get paid for the work we do with our minds? And, if we can't get paid, what will
assure the continued creation and distribution of such work?<P> 

<DD>Since we don't have a solution to what is a profoundly new kind of challenge, and are apparently
unable to delay the galloping digitization of everything not obstinately physical, we are sailing into
the future on a sinking ship.<DD> 

<DD>This vessel, the accumulated canon of copyright and patent law, was developed to convey forms
and methods of expression entirely different from the vaporous cargo it is now being asked to
carry. It is leaking as much from within as from without.<P> 

<DD>Legal efforts to keep the old boat floating are taking three forms: a frenzy of deck chair
rearrangement, stern warnings to the passengers that if she goes down, they will face harsh
criminal penalties, and serene, glassy-eyed denial.<P> 

<DD>Intellectual property law cannot be patched, retrofitted, or expanded to contain digitized expression
any more than real estate law might be revised to cover the allocation of broadcasting spectrum
(which, in fact, rather resembles what is being attempted here). We will need to develop an entirely
new set of methods as befits this entirely new set of circumstances.<P> 

<DD>Most of the people who actually create soft property - the programmers, hackers, and Net surfers -
already know this. Unfortunately, neither the companies they work for nor the lawyers these
companies hire have enough direct experience with nonmaterial goods to understand why they are
so problematic. They are proceeding as though the old laws can somehow be made to work, either
by grotesque expansion or by force. They are wrong.<P> 

<DD>The source of this conundrum is as simple as its solution is complex. Digital technology is
detaching information from the physical plane, where property law of all sorts has always found
definition.<P> 

<DD>Throughout the history of copyrights and patents, the proprietary assertions of thinkers have been
focused not on their ideas but on the expression of those ideas. The ideas themselves, as well as
facts about the phenomena of the world, were considered to be the collective property of humanity.
One could claim franchise, in the case of copyright, on the precise turn of phrase used to convey a
particular idea or the order in which facts were presented.<P> 

<DD>The point at which this franchise was imposed was that moment when the "word became flesh" by
departing the mind of its originator and entering some physical object, whether book or widget.
The subsequent arrival of other commercial media besides books didn't alter the legal importance of
this moment. Law protected expression and, with few (and recent) exceptions, to express was to
make physical.<P> 

<DD>Protecting physical expression had the force of convenience on its side. Copyright worked well
because, Gutenberg notwithstanding, it was hard to make a book. Furthermore, books froze their
contents into a condition which was as challenging to alter as it was to reproduce. Counterfeiting
and distributing counterfeit volumes were obvious and visible activities it was easy enough to catch
somebody in the act of doing. Finally, unlike unbounded words or images, books had material
surfaces to which one could attach copyright notices, publisher's marques, and price tags.<P> 

<DD>Mental-to-physical conversion was even more central to patent. A patent, until recently, was either
a description of the form into which materials were to be rendered in the service of some purpose,
or a description of the process by which rendition occurred. In either case, the conceptual heart of
patent was the material result. If no purposeful object could be rendered because of some material
limitation, the patent was rejected. Neither a Klein bottle nor a shovel made of silk could be
patented. It had to be a thing, and the thing had to work.<P> 

<DD>Thus, the rights of invention and authorship adhered to activities in the physical world. One didn't
get paid for ideas, but for the ability to deliver them into reality. For all practical purposes, the
value was in the conveyance and not in the thought conveyed.<P> 

<DD>In other words, the bottle was protected, not the wine.<P> 

<DD>Now, as information enters cyberspace, the native home of Mind, these bottles are vanishing. With
the advent of digitization, it is now possible to replace all previous information storage forms with
one metabottle: complex and highly liquid patterns of ones and zeros.<P> 

<DD>Even the physical/digital bottles to which we've become accustomed floppy disks, CD-ROMs, and
other discrete, shrink-wrappable bit-packages will disappear as all computers jack-in to the global
Net. While the Internet may never include every CPU on the planet, it is more than doubling every
year and can be expected to become the principal medium of information conveyance, and perhaps
eventually, the only one.<P> 

<DD>Once that has happened, all the goods of the Information Age - all of the expressions once
contained in books or film strips or newsletters - will exist either as pure thought or something very
much like thought: voltage conditions darting around the Net at the speed of light, in conditions that
one might behold in effect, as glowing pixels or transmitted sounds, but never touch or claim to
"own" in the old sense of the word.<P> 

<DD>Some might argue that information will still require some physical manifestation, such as its
magnetic existence on the titanic hard disks of distant servers, but these are bottles which have no
macroscopically discrete or personally meaningful form.<P> 

<DD>Some will also argue that we have been dealing with unbottled expression since the advent of
radio, and they would be right. But for most of the history of broadcast, there was no convenient
way to capture soft goods from the electromagnetic ether and reproduce them with quality available
in commercial packages. Only recently has this changed, and little has been done legally or
technically to address the change.<P> 

<DD>Generally, the issue of consumer payment for broadcast products was irrelevant. The consumers
themselves were the product. Broadcast media were supported either by the sale of the attention of
their audience to advertisers, by government assessing payment through taxes, or by the whining
mendicancy of annual donor drives.<P> 

<DD>All of the broadcast-support models are flawed. Support either by advertisers or government has
almost invariably tainted the purity of the goods delivered. Besides, direct marketing is gradually
killing the advertiser-support model anyway. <P>

<DD>Broadcast media gave us another payment method for a virtual product: the royalties that
broadcasters pay songwriters through such organizations as ASCAP and BMI. But, as a member
of ASCAP, I can assure you this is not a model that we should emulate. The monitoring methods
are wildly approximate. There is no parallel system of accounting in the revenue stream. It doesn't
really work. Honest.<P> 

<DD>In any case, without our old methods, based on physically defining the expression of ideas, and in
the absence of successful new models for nonphysical transaction, we simply don't know how to
assure reliable payment for mental works. To make matters worse, this comes at a time when the
human mind is replacing sunlight and mineral deposits as the principal source of new wealth.<P> 

<DD>Furthermore, the increasing difficulty of enforcing existing copyright and patent laws is already
placing in peril the ultimate source of intellectual property - the free exchange of ideas.<P> 

<DD>That is, when the primary articles of commerce in a society look so much like speech as to be
indistinguishable from it, and when the traditional methods of protecting their ownership have
become ineffectual, attempting to fix the problem with broader and more vigorous enforcement will
inevitably threaten freedom of speech. The greatest constraint on your future liberties may come not
from government but from corporate legal departments laboring to protect by force what can no
longer be protected by practical efficiency or general social consent.<P> 

<DD>Furthermore, when Jefferson and his fellow creatures of the Enlightenment designed the system
that became American copyright law, their primary objective was assuring the widespread
distribution of thought, not profit. Profit was the fuel that would carry ideas into the libraries and
minds of their new republic. Libraries would purchase books, thus rewarding the authors for their
work in assembling ideas; these ideas, otherwise "incapable of confinement," would then become
freely available to the public. But what is the role of libraries in the absence of books? How does
society now pay for the distribution of ideas if not by charging for the ideas themselves?<P> 

<DD>Additionally complicating the matter is the fact that along with the disappearance of the physical
bottles in which intellectual property protection has resided, digital technology is also erasing the
legal jurisdictions of the physical world and replacing them with the unbounded and perhaps
permanently lawless waves of cyberspace.<P> 

<DD>In cyberspace, no national or local boundaries contain the scene of a crime and determine the
method of its prosecution; worse, no clear cultural agreements define what a crime might be.
Unresolved and basic differences between Western and Asian cultural assumptions about
intellectual property can only be exacerbated when many transactions are taking place in both
hemispheres and yet, somehow, in neither.<P> 

<DD>Even in the most local of digital conditions, jurisdiction and responsibility are hard to assess. A
group of music publishers filed suit against CompuServe this fall because it allowed its users to
upload musical compositions into areas where other users might access them. But since
CompuServe cannot practically exercise much control over the flood of bits that passes between its
subscribers, it probably shouldn't be held responsible for unlawfully "publishing" these works.<P> 

<DD>Notions of property, value, ownership, and the nature of wealth itself are changing more
fundamentally than at any time since the Sumerians first poked cuneiform into wet clay and called it
stored grain. Only a very few people are aware of the enormity of this shift, and fewer of them are
lawyers or public officials.<P> 

<DD>Those who do see these changes must prepare responses for the legal and social confusion that will
erupt as efforts to protect new forms of property with old methods become more obviously futile,
and, as a consequence, more adamant..."<P></FONT>

<CENTER><TABLE BORDER =0 WIDTH=400><TB><TD><P>
<FONT SIZE =4><DD>"Humanity now seems bent on creating a world economy primarily based on goods that take no
material form. In doing so, we may be eliminating any predictable connection between creators and
a fair reward for the utility or pleasure others may find in their works.<P> 

<DD>Without that connection, and without a fundamental change in consciousness to accommodate its
loss, we are building our future on furor, litigation, and institutionalized evasion of payment except
in response to raw force. We may return to the Bad Old Days of property.<P> 

<DD>Throughout the darker parts of human history, the possession and distribution of property was a
largely military matter. "Ownership" was assured those with the nastiest tools, whether fists or
armies, and the most resolute will to use them. Property was the divine right of thugs.<P> 

<DD>By the turn of the First Millennium AD, the emergence of merchant classes and landed gentry
forced the development of ethical understandings for the resolution of property disputes. In the
Middle Ages, enlightened rulers like England's Henry II began to codify this unwritten "common
law" into recorded canons. These laws were local, which didn't matter much as they were
primarily directed at real estate, a form of property that is local by definition. And, as the name
implied, was very real.<P> 

<DD>This continued to be the case as long as the origin of wealth was agricultural, but with that dawning
of the Industrial Revolution, humanity began to focus as much on means as ends. Tools acquired a
new social value and, thanks to their development, it became possible to duplicate and distribute
them in quantity.<P> 

<DD>To encourage their invention, copyright and patent law were developed in most Western countries.
These laws were devoted to the delicate task of getting mental creations into the world where they
could be used - and could enter the minds of others - while assuring their inventors compensation
for the value of their use. And, as previously stated, the systems of both law and practice which
grew up around that task were based on physical expression. <P>

<DD>Since it is now possible to convey ideas from one mind to another without ever making them
physical, we are now claiming to own ideas themselves and not merely their expression. And since
it is likewise now possible to create useful tools that never take physical form, we have taken to
patenting abstractions, sequences of virtual events, and mathematical formulae - the most unreal
estate imaginable.<P> 

<DD>In certain areas, this leaves rights of ownership in such an ambiguous condition that property again
adheres to those who can muster the largest armies. The only difference is that this time the armies
consist of lawyers. <P>

<DD>Threatening their opponents with the endless purgatory of litigation, over which some might prefer
death itself, they assert claim to any thought which might have entered another cranium within the
collective body of the corporations they serve. They act as though these ideas appeared in splendid
detachment from all previous human thought. And they pretend that thinking about a product is
somehow as good as manufacturing, distributing, and selling it.<P> 

<DD>What was previously considered a common human resource, distributed among the minds and
libraries of the world, as well as the phenomena of nature herself, is now being fenced and deeded.
It is as though a new class of enterprise had arisen that claimed to own the air. <P>

<DD>What is to be done? While there is a certain grim fun to be had in it, dancing on the grave of
copyright and patent will solve little, especially when so few are willing to admit that the occupant
of this grave is even deceased, and so many are trying to uphold by force what can no longer be
upheld by popular consent.<P> 

<DD>The legalists, desperate over their slipping grip, are vigorously trying to extend their reach. Indeed,
the United States and other proponents of GATT are making adherence to our moribund systems of
intellectual property protection a condition of membership in the marketplace of nations. For
example, China will be denied Most Favored Nation trading status unless they agree to uphold a set
of culturally alien principles that are no longer even sensibly applicable in their country of origin.<P> 

<DD>In a more perfect world, we'd be wise to declare a moratorium on litigation, legislation, and
international treaties in this area until we had a clearer sense of the terms and conditions of
enterprise in cyberspace. Ideally, laws ratify already developed social consensus. They are less the
Social Contract itself than a series of memoranda expressing a collective intent that has emerged out
of many millions of human interactions.<P> 

<DD>Humans have not inhabited cyberspace long enough or in sufficient diversity to have developed a
Social Contract which conforms to the strange new conditions of that world. Laws developed prior
to consensus usually favor the already established few who can get them passed and not society as
a whole.<P> 

<DD>To the extent that law and established social practice exists in this area, they are already in
dangerous disagreement. The laws regarding unlicensed reproduction of commercial software are
clear and stern...and rarely observed. Software piracy laws are so practically unenforceable and
breaking them has become so socially acceptable that only a thin minority appears compelled, either
by fear or conscience, to obey them. When I give speeches on this subject, I always ask how many
people in the audience can honestly claim to have no unauthorized software on their hard disks.
I've never seen more than 10 percent of the hands go up.<P> 

<DD>Whenever there is such profound divergence between law and social practice, it is not society that
adapts. Against the swift tide of custom, the software publishers' current practice of hanging a few
visible scapegoats is so obviously capricious as to only further diminish respect for the law.<P> 

<DD>Part of the widespread disregard for commercial software copyrights stems from a legislative
failure to understand the conditions into which it was inserted. To assume that systems of law
based in the physical world will serve in an environment as fundamentally different as cyberspace
is a folly for which everyone doing business in the future will pay.<P> 

<DD>As I will soon discuss in detail, unbounded intellectual property is very different from physical
property and can no longer be protected as though these differences did not exist. For example, if
we continue to assume that value is based on scarcity, as it is with regard to physical objects, we
will create laws that are precisely contrary to the nature of information, which may, in many cases,
increase in value with distribution.<P> 

<DD>The large, legally risk-averse institutions most likely to play by the old rules will suffer for their
compliance. As more lawyers, guns, and money are invested in either protecting their rights or
subverting those of their opponents, their ability to produce new technology will simply grind to a
halt as every move they make drives them deeper into a tar pit of courtroom warfare. <P>

<DD>Faith in law will not be an effective strategy for high-tech companies. Law adapts by continuous
increments and at a pace second only to geology. Technology advances in lunging jerks, like the
punctuation of biological evolution grotesquely accelerated. Real-world conditions will continue to
change at a blinding pace, and the law will lag further behind, more profoundly confused. This
mismatch may prove impossible to overcome.<P>

<DD>Promising economies based on purely digital products will either be born in a state of paralysis, as
appears to be the case with multimedia, or continue in a brave and willful refusal by their owners to
play the ownership game at all.<P> 

<DD>In the United States one can already see a parallel economy developing, mostly among small, fast
moving enterprises who protect their ideas by getting into the marketplace quicker then their larger
competitors who base their protection on fear and litigation.<P> 

<DD>Perhaps those who are part of the problem will simply quarantine themselves in court, while those
who are part of the solution will create a new society based, at first, on piracy and freebooting. It
may well be that when the current system of intellectual property law has collapsed, as seems
inevitable, that no new legal structure will arise in its place.<P> 

<DD>But something will happen. After all, people do business. When a currency becomes meaningless,
business is done in barter. When societies develop outside the law, they develop their own
unwritten codes, practices, and ethical systems. While technology may undo law, technology
offers methods for restoring creative rights.<P> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>A Taxonomy of Information</FONT></CENTER><P>

<DD>It seems to me that the most productive thing to do now is to look into the true nature of what we're
trying to protect. How much do we really know about information and its natural behaviors? <P>

<DD>What are the essential characteristics of unbounded creation? How does it differ from previous
forms of property? How many of our assumptions about it have actually been about its containers
rather than their mysterious contents? What are its different species and how does each of them
lend itself to control? What technologies will be useful in creating new virtual bottles to replace the
old physical ones? <P>

<DD>Of course, information is, by nature, intangible and hard to define. Like other such deep
phenomena as light or matter, it is a natural host to paradox. It is most helpful to understand light
as being both a particle and a wave, an understanding of information may emerge in the abstract
congruence of its several different properties which might be described by the following three
statements:<P> 

        <DD>Information is an activity. 
        <DD>Information is a life form. 
        <DD>Information is a relationship.<P> 
In the following section, I will examine each of these..." <P></FONT>

<HR>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>I. INFORMATION IS AN ACTIVITY</FONT></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=400><TB><TD><P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>"Information Is a Verb, Not a Noun</B></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=4><DD>Freed of its containers, information is obviously not a thing. In fact, it is something that happens in
the field of interaction between minds or objects or other pieces of information.<P> 

<DD>Gregory Bateson, expanding on the information theory of Claude Shannon, said, "Information is a
difference which makes a difference." Thus, information only really exists in the Delta. The
making of that difference is an activity within a relationship. Information is an action which
occupies time rather than a state of being which occupies physical space, as is the case with hard
goods. It is the pitch, not the baseball, the dance, not the dancer.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Information Is Experienced, Not Possessed</FONT><P>

<DD>Even when it has been encapsulated in some static form like a book or a hard disk, information is
still something that happens to you as you mentally decompress it from its storage code. But,
whether it's running at gigabits per second or words per minute, the actual decoding is a process
that must be performed by and upon a mind, a process that must take place in time.<P> 

<DD>There was a cartoon in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists a few years ago that illustrated this point
beautifully. In the drawing, a holdup man trains his gun on the sort of bespectacled fellow you'd
figure might have a lot of information stored in his head. "Quick," orders the bandit, "give me all
your ideas."<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Information Has to Move</FONT><P>
<DD>Sharks are said to die of suffocation if they stop swimming, and the same is nearly true of
information. Information that isn't moving ceases to exist as anything but potential...at least until it
is allowed to move again. For this reason, the practice of information hoarding, common in
bureaucracies, is an especially wrong-headed artifact of physically based value systems.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Information Is Conveyed by Propagation, Not Distribution</FONT><P>

<DD>The way in which information spreads is also very different from the distribution of physical
goods. It moves more like something from nature than from a factory. It can concatenate like
falling dominos or grow in the usual fractal lattice, like frost spreading on a window, but it cannot
be shipped around like widgets, except to the extent that it can be contained in them. It doesn't
simply move on; it leaves a trail everywhere it's been.<P> 

<DD>The central economic distinction between information and physical property is that information can
be transferred without leaving the possession of the original owner. If I sell you my horse, I can't
ride him after that. If I sell you what I know, we both know it.<P> 
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=5><CENTER>II. INFORMATION IS A LIFE FORM</CENTER></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Information Wants to Be Free</FONT><P>

<DD>Stewart Brand is generally credited with this elegant statement of the obvious, which recognizes
both the natural desire of secrets to be told and the fact that they might be capable of possessing
something like a "desire" in the first place.<P> 

<DD>English biologist and philosopher Richard Dawkins proposed the idea of "memes," self-replicating
patterns of information that propagate themselves across the ecologies of mind, a pattern of
reproduction much like that of life forms.<P> 

<DD>I believe they are life forms in every respect but their freedom from the carbon atom. They
self-reproduce, they interact with their surroundings and adapt to them, they mutate, they persist.
They evolve to fill the empty niches of their local environments, which are, in this case the
surrounding belief systems and cultures of their hosts, namely, us.<P> 

<DD>Indeed, sociobiologists like Dawkins make a plausible case that carbon-based life forms are
information as well, that, as the chicken is an egg's way of making another egg, the entire
biological spectacle is just the DNA molecule's means of copying out more information strings
exactly like itself.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Information Replicates into the Cracks of Possibility</FONT><P>

<DD>Like DNA helices, ideas are relentless expansionists, always seeking new opportunities for
Lebensraum. And, as in carbon-based nature, the more robust organisms are extremely adept at
finding new places to live. Thus, just as the common housefly has insinuated itself into practically
every ecosystem on the planet, so has the meme of "life after death" found a niche in most minds,
or psycho-ecologies.<P> 

<DD>The more universally resonant an idea or image or song , the more minds it will enter and remain
within. Trying to stop the spread of a really robust piece of information is about as easy as keeping
killer bees south of the border.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Information Wants to Change</FONT><P>

<DD>If ideas and other interactive patterns of information are indeed life forms, they can be expected to
evolve constantly into forms which will be more perfectly adapted to their surroundings. And, as
we see, they are doing this all the time.<P> 

<DD>But for a long time, our static media, whether carvings in stone, ink on paper, or dye on celluloid,
have strongly resisted the evolutionary impulse, exalting as a consequence the author's ability to
determine the finished product. But, as in an oral tradition, digitized information has no "final cut."<P>

<DD>Digital information, unconstrained by packaging, is a continuing process more like the
metamorphosing tales of prehistory than anything that will fit in shrink-wrap. From the Neolithic to
Gutenberg (monks aside), information was passed on, mouth to ear, changing with every retelling
(or resinging). The stories which once shaped our sense of the world didn't have authoritative
versions. They adapted to each culture in which they found themselves being told.<P> 

<DD>Because there was never a moment when the story was frozen in print, the so-called "moral" right
of storytellers to own the tale was neither protected nor recognized. The story simply passed
through each of them on its way to the next, where it would assume a different form. As we return
to continuous information, we can expect the importance of authorship to diminish. Creative people
may have to renew their acquaintance with humility.<P> 

<DD>But our system of copyright makes no accommodation whatever for expressions which don't
become fixed at some point nor for cultural expressions which lack a specific author or inventor.<P> 

<DD>Jazz improvisations, stand-up comedy routines, mime performances, developing monologues, and
unrecorded broadcast transmissions all lack the Constitutional requirement of fixation as a
"writing." Without being fixed by a point of publication the liquid works of the future will all look
more like these continuously adapting and changing forms and will therefore exist beyond the reach
of copyright.<P> 

<DD>Copyright expert Pamela Samuelson tells of having attended a conference last year convened
around the fact that Western countries may legally appropriate the music, designs, and biomedical
lore of aboriginal people without compensation to their tribes of origin since those tribes are not an
"author" or "inventors."<P> 

<DD>But soon most information will be generated collaboratively by the cyber-tribal hunter-gatherers of
cyberspace. Our arrogant legal dismissal of the rights of "primitives" will be soon return to haunt

<FONT SIZE=4>Information Is Perishable</FONT><P>

<DD>With the exception of the rare classic, most information is like farm produce. Its quality degrades
rapidly both over time and in distance from the source of production. But even here, value is highly
subjective and conditional. Yesterday's papers are quite valuable to the historian. In fact, the older
they are, the more valuable they become. On the other hand, a commodities broker might consider
news of an event that occurred more than an hour ago to have lost any relevance.<P> 
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=5><CENTER>III. INFORMATION IS A RELATIONSHIP</CENTER></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Meaning Has Value and Is Unique to Each Case</FONT><P>

<DD>In most cases, we assign value to information based on its meaningfulness. The place where
information dwells, the holy moment where transmission becomes reception, is a region which has
many shifting characteristics and flavors depending on the relationship of sender and receiver, the
depth of their interactivity.<P> 

<DD>Each such relationship is unique. Even in cases where the sender is a broadcast medium, and no
response is returned, the receiver is hardly passive. Receiving information is often as creative an
act as generating it.<P> 

<DD>The value of what is sent depends entirely on the extent to which each individual receiver has the
receptors - shared terminology, attention, interest, language, paradigm - necessary to render what
is received meaningful.<P> 

<DD>Understanding is a critical element increasingly overlooked in the effort to turn information into a
commodity. Data may be any set of facts, useful or not, intelligible or inscrutable, germane or
irrelevant. Computers can crank out new data all night long without human help, and the results
may be offered for sale as information. They may or may not actually be so. Only a human being
can recognize the meaning that separates information from data.<P> 

<DD>In fact, information, in the economic sense of the word, consists of data which have been passed
through a particular human mind and found meaningful within that mental context. One fella's
information is all just data to someone else. If you're an anthropologist, my detailed charts of
Tasaday kinship patterns might be critical information to you. If you're a banker from Hong Kong,
they might barely seem to be data.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Familiarity Has More Value than Scarcity</FONT><P>

<DD>With physical goods, there is a direct correlation between scarcity and value. Gold is more valuable
than wheat, even though you can't eat it. While this is not always the case, the situation with
information is often precisely the reverse. Most soft goods increase in value as they become more
common. Familiarity is an important asset in the world of information. It may often be true that the
best way to raise demand for your product is to give it away.<P> 

<DD>While this has not always worked with shareware, it could be argued that there is a connection
between the extent to which commercial software is pirated and the amount which gets sold.
Broadly pirated software, such as Lotus 1-2-3 or WordPerfect, becomes a standard and benefits
from Law of Increasing Returns based on familiarity.<P> 

<DD>In regard to my own soft product, rock 'n' roll songs, there is no question that the band I write
them for, the Grateful Dead, has increased its popularity enormously by giving them away. We
have been letting people tape our concerts since the early seventies, but instead of reducing the
demand for our product, we are now the largest concert draw in America, a fact that is at least in
part attributable to the popularity generated by those tapes.<P> 

<DD>True, I don't get any royalties on the millions of copies of my songs which have been extracted
from concerts, but I see no reason to complain. The fact is, no one but the Grateful Dead can
perform a Grateful Dead song, so if you want the experience and not its thin projection, you have
to buy a ticket from us. In other words, our intellectual property protection derives from our being
the only real-time source of it.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Exclusivity Has Value</FONT><P>

<DD>The problem with a model that turns the physical scarcity/value ratio on its head is that sometimes
the value of information is very much based on its scarcity. Exclusive possession of certain facts
makes them more useful. If everyone knows about conditions which might drive a stock price up,
the information is valueless. <P>

<DD>But again, the critical factor is usually time. It doesn't matter if this kind of information eventually
becomes ubiquitous. What matters is being among the first who possess it and act on it. While
potent secrets usually don't stay secret, they may remain so long enough to advance the cause of
their original holders.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Point of View and Authority Have Value</FONT><P>

<DD>In a world of floating realities and contradictory maps, rewards will accrue to those commentators
whose maps seem to fit their territory snugly, based on their ability to yield predictable results for
those who use them.<P> 

<DD>In aesthetic information, whether poetry or rock 'n' roll, people are willing to buy the new product
of an artist, sight-unseen, based on their having been delivered a pleasurable experience by
previous work.<P> 

<DD>Reality is an edit. People are willing to pay for the authority of those editors whose point of view
seems to fit best. And again, point of view is an asset which cannot be stolen or duplicated. No one
sees the world as Esther Dyson does, and the handsome fee she charges for her newsletter is
actually payment for the privilege of looking at the world through her unique eyes. <P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Time Replaces Space</FONT><P>

<DD>In the physical world, value depends heavily on possession or proximity in space. One owns the
material that falls inside certain dimensional boundaries. The ability to act directly, exclusively, and
as one wishes upon what falls inside those boundaries is the principal right of ownership. The
relationship between value and scarcity is a limitation in space.<P> 

<DD>In the virtual world, proximity in time is a value determinant. An informational product is generally
more valuable the closer purchaser can place themselves to the moment of its expression, a
limitation in time. Many kinds of information degrade rapidly with either time or reproduction.
Relevance fades as the territory they map changes. Noise is introduced and bandwidth lost with
passage away from the point where the information is first produced.<P> 

<DD>Thus, listening to a Grateful Dead tape is hardly the same experience as attending a Grateful Dead
concert. The closer one can get to the headwaters of an informational stream, the better one's
chances of finding an accurate picture of reality in it. In an era of easy reproduction, the
informational abstractions of popular experiences will propagate out from their source moments to
reach anyone who's interested. But it's easy enough to restrict the real experience of the desirable
event, whether knock-out punch or guitar lick, to those willing to pay for being there.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>The Protection of Execution</FONT><P>

<DD>In the hick town I come from, they don't give you much credit for just having ideas. You are
judged by what you can make of them. As things continue to speed up, I think we see that
execution is the best protection for those designs which become physical products. Or, as Steve
Jobs once put it, "Real artists ship." The big winner is usually the one who gets to the market first
(and with enough organizational force to keep the lead).<P> 

<DD>But, as we become fixated upon information commerce, many of us seem to think that originality
alone is sufficient to convey value, deserving, with the right legal assurances, of a steady wage. In
fact, the best way to protect intellectual property is to act on it. It's not enough to invent and patent;
one has to innovate as well. Someone claims to have patented the microprocessor before Intel.
Maybe so. If he'd actually started shipping microprocessors before Intel, his claim would seem far
less spurious.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Information as Its Own Reward</FONT><P>

<DD>It is now a commonplace to say that money is information. With the exception of Krugerrands,
crumpled cab fare, and the contents of those suitcases that drug lords are reputed to carry, most of
the money in the informatized world is in ones and zeros. The global money supply sloshes around
the Net, as fluid as weather. It is also obvious, that information has become as fundamental to the
creation of modern wealth as land and sunlight once were.<P> 

<DD>What is less obvious is the extent to which information is acquiring intrinsic value, not as a means
to acquisition but as the object to be acquired. I suppose this has always been less explicitly the
case. In politics and academia, potency and information have always been closely related.<P> 

<DD>However, as we increasingly buy information with money, we begin to see that buying
information with other information is simple economic exchange without the necessity of
converting the product into and out of currency. This is somewhat challenging for those who like
clean accounting, since, information theory aside, informational exchange rates are too squishy to
quantify to the decimal point.<P> 

<DD>Nevertheless, most of what a middle-class American purchases has little to do with survival. We
buy beauty, prestige, experience, education, and all the obscure pleasures of owning. Many of
these things can not only be expressed in nonmaterial terms, they can be acquired by nonmaterial
means. <P>

<DD>And then there are the inexplicable pleasures of information itself, the joys of learning, knowing,
and teaching; the strange good feeling of information coming into and out of oneself. Playing with
ideas is a recreation which people are willing to pay a lot for, given the market for books and
elective seminars. We'd likely spend even more money for such pleasures if we didn't have so
many opportunities to pay for ideas with other ideas.<P> 

<DD>This explains much of the collective "volunteer" work which fills the archives, newsgroups, and
databases of the Internet. Its denizens are not working for "nothing," as is widely believed. Rather
they are getting paid in something besides money. It is an economy which consists almost entirely
of information.<P> 

<DD>This may become the dominant form of human trade, and if we persist in modeling economics on a
strictly monetary basis, we may be gravely misled..."<P> </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Getting Paid in Cyberspace</B></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=4><DD>"How all the foregoing relates to solutions to the crisis in intellectual property is something I've
barely started to wrap my mind around. It's fairly paradigm warping to look at information through
fresh eyes - to see how very little it is like pig iron or pork bellies, and to imagine the tottering
travesties of case law we will stack up if we go on legally treating it as though it were.<P> 

<DD>As I've said, I believe these towers of outmoded boilerplate will be a smoking heap sometime in
the next decade, and we mind miners will have no choice but to cast our lot with new systems that
work.<P> 

<DD>I'm not really so gloomy about our prospects as readers of this jeremiad so far might conclude.
Solutions will emerge. Nature abhors a vacuum and so does commerce.<P> 

<DD>Indeed, one of the aspects of the electronic frontier which I have always found most appealing -
and the reason Mitch Kapor and I used that phrase in naming our foundation - is the degree to
which it resembles the 19th-century American West in its natural preference for social devices that
emerge from its conditions rather than those that are imposed from the outside. <P>

<DD>Until the West was fully settled and "civilized" in this century, order was established according to
an unwritten Code of the West, which had the fluidity of common law rather than the rigidity of
statutes. Ethics were more important than rules. Understandings were preferred over laws, which
were, in any event, largely unenforceable.<P> 

<DD>I believe that law, as we understand it, was developed to protect the interests which arose in the
two economic "waves" which Alvin Toffler accurately identified in The Third Wave. The First
Wave was agriculturally based and required law to order ownership of the principal source of
production, land. In the Second Wave, manufacturing became the economic mainspring, and the
structure of modern law grew around the centralized institutions that needed protection for their
reserves of capital, labor, and hardware.<P> 

<DD>Both of these economic systems required stability. Their laws were designed to resist change and
to assure some equability of distribution within a fairly static social framework. The empty niches
had to be constrained to preserve the predictability necessary to either land stewardship or capital
formation.<P> 

<DD>In the Third Wave we have now entered, information to a large extent replaces land, capital, and
hardware, and information is most at home in a much more fluid and adaptable environment. The
Third Wave is likely to bring a fundamental shift in the purposes and methods of law which will
affect far more than simply those statutes which govern intellectual property.<P> 

<DD>The "terrain" itself - the architecture of the Net - may come to serve many of the purposes which
could only be maintained in the past by legal imposition. For example, it may be unnecessary to
constitutionally assure freedom of expression in an environment which, in the words of my fellow
EFF co-founder John Gilmore, "treats censorship as a malfunction" and reroutes proscribed ideas
around it.<P> 

<DD>Similar natural balancing mechanisms may arise to smooth over the social discontinuities which
previously required legal intercession to set right. On the Net, these differences are more likely to
be spanned by a continuous spectrum that connects as much as it separates.<P> 

<DD>And, despite their fierce grip on the old legal structure, companies that trade in information are
likely to find that their increasing inability to deal sensibly with technological issues will not be
remedied in the courts, which won't be capable of producing verdicts predictable enough to be
supportive of long-term enterprise. Every litigation will become like a game of Russian roulette,
depending on the depth of the presiding judge's clue-impairment.<P> 

<DD>Uncodified or adaptive "law," while as "fast, loose, and out of control" as other emergent forms, is
probably more likely to yield something like justice at this point. In fact, one can already see in
development new practices to suit the conditions of virtual commerce. The life forms of
information are evolving methods to protect their continued reproduction.<P> 

<DD>For example, while all the tiny print on a commercial diskette envelope punctiliously requires a
great deal of those who would open it, few who read those provisos follow them to the letter. And
yet, the software business remains a very healthy sector of the American economy.<P> 

<DD>Why is this? Because people seem to eventually buy the software they really use. Once a program
becomes central to your work, you want the latest version of it, the best support, the actual
manuals, all privileges attached to ownership. Such practical considerations will, in the absence of
working law, become more and more important in getting paid for what might easily be obtained
for nothing. <P>

<DD>I do think that some software is being purchased in the service of ethics or the abstract awareness
that the failure to buy it will result in its not being produced any longer, but I'm going to leave
those motivators aside. While I believe that the failure of law will almost certainly result in a
compensating re-emergence of ethics as the ordering template of society, this is a belief I don't
have room to support here. <P>

<DD>Instead, I think that, as in the case cited above, compensation for soft products will be driven
primarily by practical considerations, all of them consistent with the true properties of digital
information, where the value lies in it, and how it can be both manipulated and protected by
technology.<P> 

<DD>While the conundrum remains a conundrum, I can begin to see the directions from which solutions
may emerge, based in part on broadening those practical solutions which are already in practice.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Relationship and Its Tools</FONT><P>

<DD>I believe one idea is central to understanding liquid commerce: Information economics, in the
absence of objects, will be based more on relationship than possession.<P> 

<DD>One existing model for the future conveyance of intellectual property is real-time performance, a
medium currently used only in theater, music, lectures, stand-up comedy, and pedagogy. I believe
the concept of performance will expand to include most of the information economy, from
multicasted soap operas to stock analysis. In these instances, commercial exchange will be more
like ticket sales to a continuous show than the purchase of discrete bundles of that which is being
shown.<P> 

<DD>The other existing, model, of course, is service. The entire professional class - doctors, lawyers,
consultants, architects, and so on - are already being paid directly for their intellectual property.
Who needs copyright when you're on a retainer?<P> 

<DD>In fact, until the late 18th century this model was applied to much of what is now copyrighted.
Before the industrialization of creation, writers, composers, artists, and the like produced their
products in the private service of patrons. Without objects to distribute in a mass market, creative
people will return to a condition somewhat like this, except that they will serve many patrons,
rather than one.<P> 

<DD>We can already see the emergence of companies which base their existence on supporting and
enhancing the soft property they create rather than selling it by the shrink-wrapped piece or
embedding it in widgets. <P>

<DD>Trip Hawkins's new company for creating and licensing multimedia tools, 3DO, is an example of
what I'm talking about. 3DO doesn't intend to produce any commercial software or consumer
devices. Instead, it will act as a kind of private standards setting body, mediating among software
and device creators who will be their licensees. It will provide a point of commonality for
relationships between a broad spectrum of entities.<P> 

<DD>In any case, whether you think of yourself as a service provider or a performer, the future
protection of your intellectual property will depend on your ability to control your relationship to
the market - a relationship which will most likely live and grow over a period of time.<P> 

<DD>The value of that relationship will reside in the quality of performance, the uniqueness of your
point of view, the validity of your expertise, its relevance to your market, and, underlying
everything, the ability of that market to access your creative services swiftly, conveniently, and
interactively.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Interaction and Protection</FONT><P>

<DD>Direct interaction will provide a lot of intellectual property protection in the future, and, indeed,
already has. No one knows how many software pirates have bought legitimate copies of a program
after calling its publisher for technical support and offering some proof of purchase, but I would
guess the number is very high.<P> 

<DD>The same kind of controls will be applicable to "question and answer" relationships between
authorities (or artists) and those who seek their expertise. Newsletters, magazines, and books will
be supplemented by the ability of their subscribers to ask direct questions of authors.<P> 

<DD>Interactivity will be a billable commodity even in the absence of authorship. As people move into
the Net and increasingly get their information directly from its point of production, unfiltered by
centralized media, they will attempt to develop the same interactive ability to probe reality that only
experience has provided them in the past. Live access to these distant "eyes and ears" will be much
easier to cordon than access to static bundles of stored but easily reproducible information.<P> 

<DD>In most cases, control will be based on restricting access to the freshest, highest bandwidth
information. It will be a matter of defining the ticket, the venue, the performer, and the identity of
the ticket holder, definitions which I believe will take their forms from technology, not law. In
most cases, the defining technology will be cryptography.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>Crypto Bottling</FONT><P>

<DD>Cryptography, as I've said perhaps too many times, is the "material" from which the walls,
boundaries - and bottles - of cyberspace will be fashioned.<P> 

<DD>Of course there are problems with cryptography or any other purely technical method of property
protection. It has always appeared to me that the more security you hide your goods behind, the
more likely you are to turn your sanctuary into a target. Having come from a place where people
leave their keys in their cars and don't even have keys to their houses, I remain convinced that the
best obstacle to crime is a society with its ethics intact. <P>

<DD>While I admit that this is not the kind of society most of us live in, I also believe that a social over
reliance on protection by barricades rather than conscience will eventually wither the latter by
turning intrusion and theft into a sport, rather than a crime. This is already occurring in the digital
domain as is evident in the activities of computer crackers.<P> 

<DD>Furthermore, I would argue that initial efforts to protect digital copyright by copy protection
contributed to the current condition in which most otherwise ethical computer users seem morally
untroubled by their possession of pirated software.<P> 

<DD>Instead of cultivating among the newly computerized a sense of respect for the work of their
fellows, early reliance on copy protection led to the subliminal notion that cracking into a software
package somehow "earned" one the right to use it. Limited not by conscience but by technical skill,
many soon felt free to do whatever they could get away with. This will continue to be a potential
liability of the encryption of digitized commerce.<P> 

<DD>Furthermore, it's cautionary to remember that copy protection was rejected by the market in most
areas. Many of the upcoming efforts to use cryptography-based protection schemes will probably
suffer the same fate. People are not going to tolerate much that makes computers harder to use than
they already are without any benefit to the user.<P> 

<DD>Nevertheless, encryption has already demonstrated a certain blunt utility. New subscriptions to
various commercial satellite TV services skyrocketed recently after their deployment of more robust
encryption of their feeds. This, despite a booming backwoods trade in black decoder chips,
conducted by folks who'd look more at home running moonshine than cracking code. <P>

<DD>Another obvious problem with encryption as a global solution is that once something has been
unscrambled by a legitimate licensee, it may be available to massive reproduction.<P> 

<DD>In some instances, reproduction following decryption may not be a problem. Many soft products
degrade sharply in value with time. It may be that the only real interest in such products will be
among those who have purchased the keys to immediacy.<P> 

<DD>Furthermore, as software becomes more modular and distribution moves online, it will begin to
metamorphose in direct interaction with its user base. Discontinuous upgrades will smooth into a
constant process of incremental improvement and adaptation, some of it manmade and some of it
arising through genetic algorithms. Pirated copies of software may become too static to have much
value to anyone.<P> 

<DD>Even in cases such as images, where the information is expected to remain fixed, the unencrypted
file could still be interwoven with code which could continue to protect it by a wide variety of
means.<P> 

<DD>In most of the schemes I can project, the file would be "alive" with permanently embedded
software that could "sense" the surrounding conditions and interact with them. For example, it
might contain code that could detect the process of duplication and cause it to self-destruct.<P> 

<DD>Other methods might give the file the ability to "phone home" through the Net to its original owner.
The continued integrity of some files might require periodic "feeding" with digital cash from their
host, which they would then relay back to their authors.<P> 

<DD>Of course files that possess the independent ability to communicate upstream sound uncomfortably
like the Morris Internet Worm. "Live" files do have a certain viral quality. And serious privacy
issues would arise if everyone's computer were packed with digital spies.<P> 

<DD>The point is that cryptography will enable protection technologies that will develop rapidly in the
obsessive competition that has always existed between lock-makers and lock-breakers.<P> 

<DD>But cryptography will not be used simply for making locks. It is also at the heart of both digital
signatures and the aforementioned digital cash, both of which I believe will be central to the future
protection of intellectual property.<P> 

<DD>I believe that the generally acknowledged failure of the shareware model in software had less to do
with dishonesty than with the simple inconvenience of paying for shareware. If the payment
process can be automated, as digital cash and signature will make possible, I believe that soft
product creators will reap a much higher return from the bread they cast upon the waters of
cyberspace.<P> 

<DD>Moreover, they will be spared much of the overhead presently attached to the marketing,
manufacture, sales, and distribution of information products, whether those products are computer
programs, books, CDs, or motion pictures. This will reduce prices and further increase the
likelihood of noncompulsory payment.<P> 

<DD>But of course there is a fundamental problem with a system that requires, through technology,
payment for every access to a particular expression. It defeats the original Jeffersonian purpose of
seeing that ideas were available to everyone regardless of their economic station. I am not
comfortable with a model that will restrict inquiry to the wealthy.<P> 

<FONT SIZE=4>An Economy of Verbs</FONT><P>

<DD>The future forms and protections of intellectual property are densely obscured at this entrance to the
Virtual Age. Nevertheless, I can make (or reiterate) a few flat statements that I earnestly believe
won't look too silly in 50 years.<P> 

       <DD>In the absence of the old containers, almost everything we think we know about
       intellectual property is wrong. We're going to have to unlearn it. We're going to have to
       look at information as though we'd never seen the stuff before. 
       The protections that we will develop will rely far more on ethics and technology than on
       law. 
       Encryption will be the technical basis for most intellectual property protection. (And
       should, for many reasons, be made more widely available.) 
       The economy of the future will be based on relationship rather than possession. It will be
       continuous rather than sequential. 
       And finally, in the years to come, most human exchange will be virtual rather than
       physical, consisting not of stuff but the stuff of which dreams are made. Our future
       business will be conducted in a world made more of verbs than nouns."</FONT>

KNOWlaw Group of the Toronto law firm of McMillan Binch. This
article was prepared with the assistance of Lauralee Bielert.)
<BR>
</I>
<P>
It's time to take copyright seriously. Freelance writers, photographers
and illustrators delivered this message loud and clear with the
launch last month of a $100 million class action suit against
Thomson Corp. Heather Robertson, a prize winning non-fiction author,
launched the suit on behalf of all Canadian freelancers. <BR>
<P>
Robertson, whose book <I>Driving Force</I> won the 1996 Canadian
Business Book Award, has earned a living as a full-time freelance
writer for the last 25 years. The suit claims Thomson placed freelance
materials in electronic databases without payment or authorization.
<BR>
<P>
For producers of films or television programs, the Thomson suit
is a sharp reminder that anytime they have a freelancer do any
piece of work, they should make sure that there is a certain clear
written agreement in place setting out the media in which the
producer can make use of the freelancer's work.<BR>
<P>
Thomson's Troubles<BR>
<P>
The Globe and Mail launched its Infoglobe electronic database
in 1978, but it's only recently that freelance writers have begun
to demand compensation for the electronic publication of their
work. <BR>
<P>
For many years, the freelance/publisher relationship was quite
informal. According to general industry standards, a writer owned
an article and assigned first North American publication rights
to the acquiring newspaper or magazine, retaining the right to
resell the story to other publications. <BR>
<P>
Until recently, newspapers didn't even bother with assignment
letters let alone formal contracts, and electronic rights simply
weren't in issue.<BR>
<P>
But the new technologies have, over the last few years, raised
tough questions about risk - and reward - on the electronic highway.
The issue has been most pointedly raised, not by salaried journalists,
but by freelancers. Freelancers have expressed surprise and outrage
in finding that their work has been loaded on electronic databases
- or even on the Internet - without their permission.<BR>
<P>
What brought the issue to a head, earlier this year, was Thomson's
decision to request formal legal waivers from writers, illustrators
and photographers. Thomson was not alone: Southam, Telemedia,
and Maclean Hunter also asked contributors to sign over the rights
to their works.<BR>
<P>
In some cases, the legal language in the agreements was very broad.
For instance, the Financial Post contract asked for a &quot;non-exclusive,
perpetual, worldwide right to publish, use, sell or resell the
Work in any manner, form or media and by any means or technology
now used or hereafter used&quot;. <BR>
<P>
Other publications asked freelancers to waive their &quot;moral
rights&quot; - that is the right of creators to protect the integrity
of their work. This waiver (standard in the film and television
industries) alarmed many of the freelancers, given the ease with
which text, sound and images can be transmitted and stored in
easily manipulable bits and bytes.<BR>
<P>
What angered creators most, though, was that they were asked to
sign over their rights without any additional compensation. The
Periodical Writers Association of Canada responded to this by
enlisting the help of other writers' organizations. The end result
was the suit launched against Thomson in which the plaintiffs
are seeking damages all the way back to 1979.<BR>
<P>
Who Owns a Writer's Work?<BR>
<P>
Legally, the dispute centres around the provisions of the <I>Copyright
Act</I> which make the individual who creates a work the first
owner of the copyright in that work. This means that freelancers
retain all rights to their works except those expressly assigned
to the publisher. In other words, publishers cannot appropriate
freelance works for use in other contexts. <BR>
<P>
Employees, on the other hand, fall under an exception to the general
rule: the &quot;employer-employee&quot; exception, which provides
that the copyright of any works created by an employee in the
course of employment belongs to the employer. The situation is
further complicated by an &quot;exception to the exception&quot;
- employees who work for newspapers and magazines have the right
to restrain the publication of their works other than as part
of newspapers or periodicals. In other words, newspapers and magazines
may not have the right to use their employees' work in the electronic
media without the employees' permission.<BR>
<P>
There's a lesson here. Producers and broadcasters using freelance
or employed writers should review their practices to make sure
they have all the rights they need or may want in the future.
<BR>
<P>
U.S. Developments<BR>
<P>
While copyright differs between Canada and the U.S., similar battles
are taking place in both countries. <BR>
<P>
The highest profile fight is being led by the President of the
National Writers Union, John Tasini. In 1993, Tasini and eleven
other writers launched a suit against the New York Times and four
other news and database companies. <BR>
<P>
It is estimated that if Tasini wins his case, the liabilities
could go into the millions of dollars. Three writers' unions have
already boycotted The New York Times over its contractual demands
relating to electronic rights. One magazine - Harper's - has already
agreed to split revenues 50/50 from on-line and CD-Rom products.
<BR>
<P>
The Future of Copyright<BR>
<P>
Rethinking old practices is problematic. Even if publishers and
other producers of product for the electronic media were willing
to compensate writers for this use, there are huge practical issues
to consider. <BR>
<P>
One is how to track the use and reproduction of works for the
purposes of enforcement and compensation. Tracking has been a
particular problem in the context of electronic databases. Publishers
argue that it is difficult, if not impossible, to track use and
accurately determine the amount of revenue owing to individual
contributors.<BR>
<P>
Creators have responded with a number of practical solutions to
get around the problems of determining appropriate levels of compensation.
The National Writers Union in the U.S., for example, has set up
a publication rights clearinghouse modelled after long-standing
music organizations such as ASCAP. Photographers in the U.S. have
set up a similar clearinghouse. <BR>
<P>
Other writers' groups are proposing a simple flat fee system.
Computer buffs are looking at a way of electronically tagging
their works so that user access through electronic databases can
be tracked automatically.<BR>
<P>
Robertson's case has moved electronic copyright issues to centre
stage. Whether her case ever gets to court is an open question.
With $100 million at stake, we need a serious debate on how creators,
publishers and other producers should profit from the electronic
highway. <BR>

<P></P>
<P></P> 
<P><P>
FACTS<BR>

<P>
&#183; Shea edits and owns The American Reporter,
the US daily newspaper distributed exclusively through electronic
means. <BR>

<P>
&#183; challenged the law because it breached
his free speech rights. He attacked because it was vague - no
one had a clear idea of what conduct will subject them to prosecution
or criminal liability. He also claimed the Act was too broad because
it targets a broader category of speech than necessary to achieve
the government's goal and constitutes a ban on certain constitutionally
protected speech between adults.<BR>

<P>
1. The court was not sympathetic to vagueness
arguments.
<P>
2. But it did think Shea might well succeed
in arguing about the breadth of the Act, and that it banned constitutionally
protected indecent communication between adults.
<P>
3. Washington conceded that the attacked provisions
were unconstitutional as a total ban on such communication.
<P>
4. Current technology provides no feasible
means for most serve to use the defences in the statute.<BR>

<P>
DEFENCES <BR>

<P>
&#183; The CDA provides several defences, including:
<BR>

<P>
1. taking reasonable, effective, and appropriate
measures in good faith to prevent access by minors.
<P>
2. restricting access to communication prohibited
under the Act by requiring the use of a verified credit card,
debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification
number.<BR>

<P>
&#183; There is no basis for concluding that
Internet services are less able than other publishers to become
familiar with relevant community standards; the court suggests
that interactive computer services would cultivate a heightened
awareness of regional cultural differences, to which they must
be sensitive.
<P>
&#183; A user must take several steps to access
material through an interactive communications service; indecent
content on the Internet ordinarily does not assault a user without
warning; strict scrutiny will apply to determine whether the Act
is overbroad 
<P>
&#183; There is no persuasive evidence that
a substantial portion of Internet services can make available
material potentially within the scope of the law without fear
of prosecution or criminal liability; the defences offer no assurance
that content providers will not be prosecuted under the Act.<BR>

<P></P>
<P></P> 
<P><P>
FACTS<BR>

<P>
&#183; The suit was brought by a number of
organizations and individuals who, associated with the computer
and communications industries, or who publish or post materials
on the Internet. They sued the federal government to prevent implementation
of the CDA.
<P>
&#183; They had previously won a temporary
restraining order based on the fact that &quot;indecency provision&quot;
of the CDA is unconstitutionally vague.
<P>
&#183; They argued that the CDA is directed
to communications over the Internet which might be deemed &quot;indecent&quot;
or &quot;patently offensive&quot; for children breached free speech
and due process guarantees.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
HELD<BR>

<P>
&#183; Motion for preliminary injunction granted.
<P>
&#183; Plaintiffs have established a reasonable
probability of eventual success in the litigation by demonstrating
that CDA is unconstitutional to the extent that reaches indecency.
<P>
&#183; Government may only regulate indecent
speech for a compelling reason, and in the least restrictive manner.
<BR>

<P>
REASONING<BR>

<P>
&#183; In seeking preliminary injunctive relief,
plaintiffs must show:
<P>
(1) a reasonable probability of eventual success
in the litigation; and
<P>
(2) irreparable injury if relief is not granted;
[also, where appropriate]
<P>
(3) the possibility of harm to other interested
persons from the grant or denial of the injunction
<P>
(4) the public interest<BR>

<P>
&#183; Plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury,
no party has any interest in the enforcement of an unconstitutional
law, and so the public interest requires that the law not be enforced.

<BR>
<BR>
<P>
LEISURE, District Judge<BR>
<P>
This is a diversity action for libel, business disparagement,
and
<P>
unfair competition, based on allegedly defamatory statements made
<P>
in a publication carried on a computerized database.  Defendant
<P>
CompuServe Inc. (&quot;CompuServe&quot;) has moved for summary
judgment
<P>
pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
For
<P>
the reasons stated below, CompuServe's motion is granted in its
<P>
entirety.<BR>
<P>
                              Background<BR>
<P>
CompuServe develops and provides computer-related products and
<P>
services, including CompuServe Information Service (&quot;CIS&quot;),
an
<P>
on-line general information service or &quot;electronic library&quot;
that
<P>
subscribers may access from a personal computer or terminal.
<P>
Subscribers to CIS pay a membership fee and online time usage
fees,
<P>
in return for which they have access to the thousands of
<P>
information sources available on CIS.  Subscribers may also obtain
<P>
access to over 150 special interest &quot;forums,&quot; which
are comprised
<P>
of electronic bulletin boards, interactive online conferences,
and
<P>
topical databases.<BR>
<P>
One forum available is the Journalism Forum, which focuses on
the
<P>
journalism industry.  Cameron Communications, Inc. (&quot;CCI&quot;),
which
<P>
is independent of CompuServe, has contracted to &quot;manage,
review,
<P>
create, delete, edit and otherwise control the contents&quot;
of the
<P>
Journalism Forum &quot;in accordance with editorial and technical
<P>
standards and conventions of style as established by CompuServe.&quot;
<P>
Affidavit of Jim Cameron, sworn to on April 4, 1991 (&quot;Cameron
<P>
Aff.&quot;), Exhibit A.<BR>
<P>
One publication available as part of the Journalism Forum is
<P>
Rumorville USA (&quot;Rumorville&quot;), a daily newsletter that
provides
<P>
reports about broadcast journalism and journalists.  Rumorville
is
<P>
published by Don Fitzpatrick Associates of San Francisco (&quot;DFA&quot;),
<P>
which is headed by defendant Don Fitzpatrick.  CompuServe has
no
<P>
employment, contractual, or other direct relationship with either
<P>
DFA or Fitzpatrick;  DFA provides Rumorville to the Journalism
<P>
Forum under a contract with CCI.  The contract between CCI and
DFA
<P>
provides that DFA &quot;accepts total responsibility for the contents&quot;
<P>
of Rumorville.  Cameron Aff., Exhibit B.  The contract also
<P>
requires CCI to limit access to Rumorville to those CIS subscribers
<P>
who have previously made membership arrangements directly with
DFA.<BR>
<P>
CompuServe has no opportunity to review Rumorville's contents
<P>
before DFA uploads it into CompuServe's computer banks, from which
<P>
it is immediately available to approved CIS subscribers.
<P>
CompuServe receives no part of any fees that DFA charges for access
<P>
to Rumorville, nor does CompuServe compensate DFA for providing
<P>
Rumorville to the Journalism Forum;  the compensation CompuServe
<P>
receives for making Rumorville available to its subscribers is
the
<P>
standard online time usage and membership fees charged to all
CIS
<P>
subscribers, regardless of the information services they use.
<P>
CompuServe maintains that, before this action was filed, it had
no
<P>
notice of any complaints about the contents of the Rumorville
<P>
publication or about DFA.<BR>
<P>
In 1990, plaintiffs Cubby, Inc. (&quot;Cubby&quot;) and Robert
Blanchard
<P>
(&quot;Blanchard&quot;) (collectively, &quot;plaintiffs&quot;)
developed Skuttlebut, a
<P>
computer database designed to publish and distribute electronically
<P>
news and gossip in the television news and radio industries.
<P>
Plaintiffs intended to compete with Rumorville;  subscribers gained
<P>
access to Skuttlebut through their personal computers after
<P>
completing subscription agreements with plaintiffs.<BR>
<P>
Plaintiffs claim that, on separate occasions in April 1990,
<P>
Rumorville published false and defamatory statements relating
to
<P>
Skuttlebut and Blanchard, and that CompuServe carried these
<P>
statements as part of the Journalism Forum. The allegedly
<P>
defamatory remarks included a suggestion that individuals at
<P>
Skuttlebut gained access to information first published by
<P>
Rumorville &quot;through some back door&quot;;  a statement that
Blanchard
<P>
was &quot;bounced&quot; from his previous employer, WABC;  and
a description
<P>
of Skuttlebut as a &quot;new start-up scam.&quot; Affidavit of
Robert G.
<P>
Blanchard, sworn to on July 11, 1991 (&quot;Blanchard Aff.&quot;),
PP 5-9.<BR>
<P>
Plaintiffs have asserted claims against CompuServe and Fitzpatrick
<P>
under New York law for libel of Blanchard, business disparagement
<P>
of Skuttlebut, and unfair competition as to Skuttlebut, based
<P>
largely upon the allegedly defamatory statements contained in
<P>
Rumorville.  CompuServe has moved, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56,
for
<P>
summary judgment on all claims against it.  CompuServe does not
<P>
dispute, solely for the purposes of this motion, that the
<P>
statements relating to Skuttlebut and Blanchard were defamatory;
<P>
rather, it argues that it acted as a distributor, and not a
<P>
publisher, of the statements, and cannot be held liable for the
<P>
statements because it did not know and had no reason to know of
the
<P>
statements.  Plaintiffs oppose CompuServe's motion for summary
<P>
judgment, claiming that genuine issues of material fact exist
and
<P>
that little in the way of discovery has been undertaken thus far.
<BR>
<P>
                              Discussion<BR>
<P>
I. Standard for Summary Judgment<BR>
<P>
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) provides that summary
<P>
judgment &quot;shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings,
<P>
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,
<P>
together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine
<P>
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled
<P>
to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); 
see also
<P>
Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552,
<P>
91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986);  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.
<P>
242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2509, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).  &quot;Summary
<P>
judgment is appropriate if, 'after drawing all reasonable
<P>
inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment
is
<P>
sought, no reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of the
<P>
non-moving party.' &quot;  United States v. All Right, Title &amp;
Interest
<P>
in Real Property, 901 F.2d 288, 290 (2d Cir.1990) (quoting Murray
<P>
v. National Broadcasting Co., 844 F.2d 988, 992 (2d Cir.), cert.
<P>
denied, 488 U.S. 955, 109 S.Ct. 391, 102 L.Ed.2d 380 (1988)).
<BR>
<P>
The substantive law governing the case will identify those facts
<P>
that are material, and &quot;[o]nly disputes over facts that might
<P>
affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will
<P>
properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.&quot;  Anderson
v.
<P>
Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510,
91
<P>
L.Ed.2d 202 (1986);  Herbert Construction Co. v. Continental
<P>
Insurance Co., 931 F.2d 989, 993 (2d Cir.1991).  &quot;[T]he judge's
<P>
function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the
<P>
truth of the matter but to determine whether there does indeed
<P>
exist a genuine issue for trial.&quot; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249,
106
<P>
S.Ct. at 2511;  see also R.C. Bigelow, Inc. v. Unilever N.V.,
867
<P>
F.2d 102, 107 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 815, 110 S.Ct.
64,
<P>
107 L.Ed.2d 31 (1989).  The party seeking summary judgment &quot;bears
<P>
the initial responsibility of informing the district court of
the
<P>
basis for its motion,&quot; and identifying which materials &quot;it
believes
<P>
demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.&quot;
<P>
Celotex, supra, 477 U.S. at 323, 106 S.Ct. at 2553;  see Binder
v.
<P>
Long Island Lighting Co., 933 F.2d 187, 191 (2d Cir.1991).<BR>
<P>
Once a motion for summary judgment is properly made, however,
the
<P>
burden then shifts to the non-moving party, which &quot; 'must
set forth
<P>
specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'
&quot;
<P>
Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250, 106 S.Ct. at 2511 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P.
<P>
56(e)). &quot;[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute
<P>
between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported
<P>
motion for summary judgment;  the requirement is that there be
no
<P>
genuine issue of material fact.&quot;  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-48,
106
<P>
S.Ct. at 2509-10 (emphasis in original).  &quot;Conclusory allegations
<P>
will not suffice to create a genuine issue.  There must be more
<P>
than a 'scintilla of evidence,' and more than 'some metaphysical
<P>
doubt as to the material facts.' &quot;  Delaware &amp; Hudson
Railway Co.
<P>
v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 902 F.2d 174, 178 (2d Cir.1990)
<P>
(quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512 and
<P>
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475
U.S.
<P>
574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1355, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986));  see also
<P>
Carey v. Crescenzi, 923 F.2d 18, 21 (2d Cir.1991).  &quot;The
non-movant
<P>
cannot 'escape summary judgment merely by vaguely asserting the
<P>
existence of some unspecified disputed material facts,' or defeat
<P>
the motion through 'mere speculation or conjecture.' &quot;  Western
<P>
World Insurance Co. v. Stack Oil, Inc., 922 F.2d 118, 121 (2d
<P>
Cir.1990) (quoting Borthwick v. First Georgetown Securities, Inc.,
<P>
892 F.2d 178, 181 (2d Cir.1989) and Knight v. U.S. Fire Insurance
<P>
Co., 804 F.2d 9, 12 (2d Cir.1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 932,
107
<P>
S.Ct. 1570, 94 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987)).<BR>
<P>
II. Libel Claim<BR>
<P>
A. The Applicable Standard of Liability<BR>
<P>
Plaintiffs base their libel claim on the allegedly defamatory
<P>
statements contained in the Rumorville publication that CompuServe
<P>
carried as part of the Journalism Forum.  CompuServe argues that,
<P>
based on the undisputed facts, it was a distributor of Rumorville,
<P>
as opposed to a publisher of the Rumorville statements.  CompuServe
<P>
further contends that, as a distributor of Rumorville, it cannot
be
<P>
held liable on the libel claim because it neither knew nor had
<P>
reason to know of the allegedly defamatory statements.  Plaintiffs,
<P>
on the other hand, argue that the Court should conclude that
<P>
CompuServe is a publisher of the statements and hold it to a higher
<P>
standard of liability.<BR>
<P>
 Ordinarily, &quot; 'one who repeats or otherwise republishes
defamatory
<P>
matter is subject to liability as if he had originally published
<P>
it.' &quot; Cianci v. New Times Publishing Co., 639 F.2d 54, 61
(2d
<P>
Cir.1980) (Friendly, J.) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts
s
<P>
578 (1977)).  With respect to entities such as news vendors, book
<P>
stores, and libraries, however, &quot;New York courts have long
held
<P>
that vendors and distributors of defamatory publications are not
<P>
liable if they neither know nor have reason to know of the
<P>
defamation.&quot;  Lerman v. Chuckleberry Publishing, Inc., 521
F.Supp.
<P>
228, 235 (S.D.N.Y.1981);  accord Macaluso v. Mondadori Publishing
<P>
Co., 527 F.Supp. 1017, 1019 (E.D.N.Y.1981).<BR>
<P>
  The requirement that a distributor must have knowledge of the
<P>
contents of a publication before liability can be imposed for
<P>
distributing that publication is deeply rooted in the First
<P>
Amendment, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth
<P>
Amendment.  &quot;[T]he constitutional guarantees of the freedom
of
<P>
speech and of the press stand in the way of imposing&quot; strict
<P>
liability on distributors for the contents of the reading materials
<P>
they carry.  Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 152-53, 80 S.Ct.
<P>
215, 218-19, 4 L.Ed.2d 205 (1959).  In Smith, the Court struck
down
<P>
an ordinance that imposed liability on a bookseller for possession
<P>
of an obscene book, regardless of whether the bookseller had
<P>
knowledge of the book's contents.  The Court reasoned that<BR>
<P>
 &quot;Every bookseller would be placed under an obligation to
make
<P>
himself aware
<P>
 of the contents of every book in his shop.  It would be altogether
<P>
unreasonable
<P>
 to demand so near an approach to omniscience.&quot;  And the
<P>
bookseller's burden
<P>
 would become the public's burden, for by restricting him the
<P>
public's access to
<P>
 reading matter would be restricted.  If the contents of bookshops
<P>
and periodical stands were restricted to material of which their
<P>
proprietors had made an inspection, they might be depleted indeed.
<BR>
<P>
Id. at 153, 80 S.Ct. at 219 (citation and footnote omitted).
<P>
Although Smith involved criminal liability, the First Amendment's
<P>
guarantees are no less relevant to the instant action:  &quot;What
a
<P>
State may not constitutionally bring about by means of a criminal
<P>
statute is likewise beyond the reach of its civil law of libel.
<P>
The fear of damage awards ... may be markedly more inhibiting
than
<P>
the fear of prosecution under a criminal statute.&quot;  New York
Times
<P>
Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 277, 84 S.Ct. 710, 724, 11 L.Ed.2d
<P>
686 (1964) (citation omitted).<BR>
<P>
CompuServe's CIS product is in essence an electronic, for-profit
<P>
library that carries a vast number of publications and collects
<P>
usage and membership fees from its subscribers in return for access
<P>
to the publications.  CompuServe and companies like it are at
the
<P>
forefront of the information industry revolution.  High technology
<P>
has markedly increased the speed with which information is gathered
<P>
and processed;  it is now possible for an individual with a
<P>
personal computer, modem, and telephone line to have instantaneous
<P>
access to thousands of news publications from across the United
<P>
States and around the world.  While CompuServe may decline to
carry
<P>
a given publication altogether, in reality, once it does decide
to
<P>
carry a publication, it will have little or no editorial control
<P>
over that publication's contents.  This is especially so when
<P>
CompuServe carries the publication as part of a forum that is
<P>
managed by a company unrelated to CompuServe.<BR>
<P>
With respect to the Rumorville publication, the undisputed facts
<P>
are that DFA uploads the text of Rumorville into CompuServe's
data
<P>
banks and makes it available to approved CIS subscribers
<P>
instantaneously. [FN1]  CompuServe has no more editorial control
<P>
over such a publication than does a public library, book store,
or
<P>
newsstand, and it would be no more feasible for CompuServe to
<P>
examine every publication it carries for potentially defamatory
<P>
statements than it would be for any other distributor to do so.
<P>
&quot;First Amendment guarantees have long been recognized as
protecting
<P>
distributors of publications....  Obviously, the national
<P>
distributor of hundreds of periodicals has no duty to monitor
each
<P>
issue of every periodical it distributes.  Such a rule would be
an
<P>
impermissible burden on the First Amendment.&quot;  Lerman v.
Flynt
<P>
Distributing Co., 745 F.2d 123, 139 (2d Cir.1984), cert. denied,
<P>
471 U.S. 1054, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479 (1985);  see also
<P>
Daniel v. Dow Jones &amp; Co., 137 Misc.2d 94, 102, 520 N.Y.S.2d
334,
<P>
340 (N.Y.Civ.Ct.1987) (computerized database service &quot;is
one of the
<P>
modern, technologically interesting, alternative ways the public
<P>
may obtain up-to-the-minute news&quot; and &quot;is entitled to
the same
<P>
protection as more established means of news distribution&quot;).
<BR>
<P>
  Technology is rapidly transforming the information industry.
 A
<P>
computerized database is the functional equivalent of a more
<P>
traditional news vendor, and the inconsistent application of a
<P>
lower standard of liability to an electronic news distributor
such
<P>
as CompuServe than that which is applied to a public library,
book
<P>
store, or newsstand would impose an undue burden on the free flow
<P>
of information.  Given the relevant First Amendment considerations,
<P>
the appropriate standard of liability to be applied to CompuServe
<P>
is whether it knew or had reason to know of the allegedly
<P>
defamatory Rumorville statements.<BR>
<P>
B. CompuServe's Liability as a Distributor CompuServe contends
that
<P>
it is undisputed that it had neither knowledge nor reason to know
<P>
of the allegedly defamatory Rumorville statements, especially
given
<P>
the large number of publications it carries and the speed with
<P>
which DFA uploads Rumorville into its computer banks and makes
the
<P>
publication available to CIS subscribers.  Affidavit of Eben L.
<P>
Kent, sworn to on April 4, 1991 (&quot;Kent Aff.&quot;), PP 7-9;
 Cameron

Aff., PP 6-7.  The burden is thus shifted to plaintiffs, who &quot;
<P>
'must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine
<P>
issue for trial.' &quot;  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477
U.S. 242,

250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (quoting
<P>
Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)). Plaintiffs have not set forth anything other
<P>
than conclusory allegations as to whether CompuServe knew or had
<P>
reason to know of the Rumorville statements, and have failed to
<P>
meet their burden on this issue.  Plaintiffs do contend that
<P>
CompuServe was informed that persons affiliated with Skuttlebut
<P>
might be &quot;hacking&quot; in order to obtain unauthorized access
to
<P>
Rumorville, but that claim is wholly irrelevant to the issue of
<P>
whether CompuServe was put on notice that the Rumorville
<P>
publication contained statements accusing the Skuttlebut principals
<P>
of engaging in &quot;hacking.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Plaintiffs have not set forth any specific facts showing that
there
<P>
is a genuine issue as to whether CompuServe knew or had reason
to
<P>
know of Rumorville's contents.  Because CompuServe, as a news
<P>
distributor, may not be held liable if it neither knew nor had
<P>
reason to know of the allegedly defamatory Rumorville statements,
<P>
summary judgment in favor of CompuServe on the libel claim is
<P>
granted.<BR>
<P>
III. Business Disparagement Claim<BR>
<P>
Plaintiffs base the claim for business disparagement of Skuttlebut
<P>
on statements published in Rumorville in April 1990.  Plaintiffs'
<P>
contention is that &quot;defendants made statements intentionally
<P>
designed to discourage its [sic] own subscribers and others in
the
<P>
news business from associating with Skuttlebut, thus disparaging
<P>
Skuttlebut's business.&quot;  Complaint, P 20.  These statements
<P>
include, inter alia, the allegedly defamatory remarks suggesting
<P>
that plaintiffs inappropriately accessed information from
<P>
Rumorville &quot;through some back door&quot; and describing Skuttlebut
as a
<P>
&quot;new start-up scam.&quot;  Blanchard Aff., PP 5, 8.<BR>
<P>
New York courts rarely use the term &quot;business disparagement&quot;
and
<P>
have not articulated the elements of such a claim.  New York's
<P>
highest court, although not using the &quot;business disparagement&quot;
<P>
label, has recognized a cause of action for tortious conduct
<P>
similar to that alleged by plaintiffs.  See Ruder &amp; Finn Inc.
v.
<P>
Seaboard Surety Co., 52 N.Y.2d 663, 670-71, 422 N.E.2d 518, 522,
<P>
439 N.Y.S.2d 858, 862 (1981) (&quot;[w]here a statement impugns
the
<P>
basic integrity or creditworthiness of a business, an action for
<P>
defamation lies&quot;). [FN2]  New York courts have applied other
labels
<P>
to similar conduct:  &quot;The tort of trade libel or injurious
<P>
falsehood consists of the knowing publication of false matter
<P>
derogatory to the plaintiff's business of a kind calculated to
<P>
prevent others from dealing with the business or otherwise
<P>
interfering with its relations with others, to its detriment.&quot;
<P>
Waste Distillation Technology, Inc. v. Blasland &amp; Bouck Engineers,
<P>
P.C., 136 A.D.2d 633, 633, 523 N.Y.S.2d 875, 876 (2d Dep't 1988).
<BR>
<P>
Regardless of the label used, the substance of plaintiffs'
<P>
&quot;business disparagement&quot; claim is similar to the action
for
<P>
defamation recognized in Ruder &amp; Finn, as well as the action
for
<P>
trade libel or injurious falsehood recognized in Waste Distillation
<P>
Technology.  Under either formulation, plaintiffs would have to
<P>
prove that CompuServe had knowledge or reason to know of
<P>
Rumorville's publication of the allegedly disparaging statements
in
<P>
order to hold CompuServe liable for business disparagement.  As
<P>
discussed with respect to the libel claim, supra, plaintiffs have
<P>
failed to meet their burden of setting forth specific facts showing
<P>
that there is a genuine issue as to whether CompuServe had
<P>
knowledge or reason to know of the April 1990 Rumorville
<P>
statements.  Summary judgment in favor of CompuServe on the
<P>
business disparagement claim is therefore granted. [FN3]<BR>
<P>
IV. Unfair Competition Claim<BR>
<P>
Plaintiffs base the unfair competition claim on the statements
<P>
concerning Skuttlebut that appeared in Rumorville in April 1990.
<P>
Plaintiffs' theory is that Rumorville launched a &quot;campaign
of
<P>
disparagement of Skuttlebut&quot; in order to compete with Skuttlebut
<P>
and retain its subscribers without reducing its fee structure.
<P>
Complaint, PP 25-26.  &quot;In order to state a claim for unfair
<P>
competition based on disparagement, [the plaintiff] must allege
<P>
some injurious falsehood intentionally uttered that caused the
<P>
plaintiff to suffer actual damage.&quot;  Brignoli v. Balch Hardy
&amp;
<P>
Scheinman, Inc., 645 F.Supp. 1201, 1208 (S.D.N.Y.1986) (citing
<P>
Diehl &amp; Sons, Inc. v. International Harvester Co., 445 F.Supp.
282,
<P>
291-92 (E.D.N.Y.1978) (citing Penn-Ohio Steel Corp. v.
<P>
Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co., 7 A.D.2d 441, 184 N.Y.S.2d 58
<P>
(1st Dep't 1959))).  &quot;Generally a statement is actionable
only
<P>
where it is made intentionally to a third person and results in
<P>
direct financial loss to the party whose interest is disparaged.&quot;
<P>
Id. (citing Payrolls &amp; Tabulating, Inc. v. Sperry Rand Corp.,
22
<P>
A.D.2d 595, 597, 257 N.Y.S.2d 884, 886 (1st Dep't 1965) (citing
<P>
Restatement of Torts ss 630 et seq.)).<BR>
<P>
Because the utterance of a disparaging statement must be
<P>
intentional in order to give rise to an unfair competition claim
<P>
based on disparagement, CompuServe may not be held liable on
<P>
plaintiffs' unfair competition claim if it did not know or have
<P>
reason to know of the Rumorville statements.  As discussed with
<P>
respect to the libel claim, supra, plaintiffs have failed to meet
<P>
their burden of setting forth specific facts showing that there
is
<P>
a genuine issue as to whether CompuServe had knowledge or reason
to
<P>
know of the April 1990 Rumorville statements.  Summary judgment
in
<P>
favor of CompuServe on the unfair competition claim is therefore
<P>
granted.<BR>
<P>
V. Vicarious Liability<BR>
<P>
Plaintiffs also argue that CompuServe may be held vicariously
<P>
liable for the allegedly defamatory Rumorville statements, based
on
<P>
an agency relationship between CompuServe, CCI, and DFA.
<P>
CompuServe contends that the undisputed facts demonstrate that,
at
<P>
most, DFA is an independent contractor of CCI and CCI is an
<P>
independent contractor of CompuServe, so that it may not be held
<P>
vicariously liable for the statements that appeared in Rumorville.
<BR>
<P>
  &quot;An essential characteristic of an agency relationship
is that
<P>
the agent acts subject to the principal's direction and control.&quot;
<P>
In re Shulman Transport Enterprises, Inc., 744 F.2d 293, 295 (2d
<P>
Cir.1984).  In contrast, an independent contractor is &quot; 'one
who,
<P>
in exercising an independent employment, contracts to do certain
<P>
work according to his own methods, and without being subject to
the
<P>
control of his employer, except as to the product or result of
his
<P>
work.' &quot;  Murray Hill Films, Inc. v. Martinair Holland, N.V.,
1987
<P>
WL 14918, * 3, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6500, * 7-* 8 (S.D.N.Y. July
<P>
17, 1987) (quoting Dorkin v. American Express Co., 74 Misc.2d
673,
<P>
675, 345 N.Y.S.2d 891, 894 (Sup.Ct.1973), aff'd, 43 A.D.2d 877,
351
<P>
N.Y.S.2d 190 (3d Dep't 1974));  accord Spiro v. Pence, 566 N.Y.S.2d
<P>
1010, 1012 (City Ct. Albany County 1991).  In order for an employer
<P>
to be held vicariously liable for the tort of an independent
<P>
contractor, the employer must have directed the act from which
the
<P>
injury resulted or have taken an affirmative, active part in its
<P>
commission.  See Ramos v. State, 34 A.D.2d 1056, 1056, 312 N.Y.S.2d
<P>
185, 186 (3d Dep't 1970).<BR>
<P>
 Based on the undisputed facts, the Court concludes that neither
<P>
CCI nor DFA should be considered an agent of CompuServe.
<P>
CompuServe, CCI, and DFA are independent of one another.
<P>
CompuServe has simply contracted with CCI for CCI to manage the
<P>
Journalism Forum;  under the contract, CCI &quot;agrees to manage,
<P>
review, create, delete, edit and otherwise control the contents
of
<P>
the [Journalism Forum], in accordance with editorial and technical
<P>
standards and conventions of style as established by CompuServe.&quot;
<P>
Cameron Aff., Exhibit A. CompuServe has thereby delegated control
<P>
over the assembly of the contents of the Journalism Forum to CCI.
<P>
CompuServe's ultimate right under the contract to remove text
from
<P>
its system for noncompliance with its standards merely constitutes
<P>
control over the result of CCI's independent work.  This level
of
<P>
control over the Journalism Forum is insufficient to rise to the
<P>
level of an agency relationship.  Similarly, the contractual
<P>
provisions calling for CompuServe to provide CCI with training
<P>
necessary to manage the Journalism Forum and to indemnify CCI
from
<P>
claims resulting from information appearing in the Journalism
Forum
<P>
do not give CompuServe sufficient control over CCI and its
<P>
management of the Journalism Forum to render CCI an agent of
<P>
CompuServe.<BR>
<P>
As for DFA, the original publisher of Rumorville, CompuServe has
no
<P>
direct contractual relationship with DFA;  DFA provides Rumorville
<P>
to the Journalism Forum under a contract with CCI.  The contract
<P>
between CCI and DFA provides that &quot;DFA accepts total responsibility
<P>
for the contents of&quot; Rumorville;  that DFA &quot;agrees to
maintain the
<P>
[Rumorville] files in a timely fashion including uploading and
<P>
merging into availability to the members of [Rumorville]&quot;;
 and
<P>
that &quot;DFA maintains total responsibility for communicating
with its
<P>
members, billing them for any membership fees and collecting same.&quot;
<P>
Cameron Aff., Exhibit B.  DFA is therefore largely independent
of
<P>
CompuServe in its publication of Rumorville, and the tenuous
<P>
relationship between DFA and CompuServe is, at most, that of an
<P>
independent contractor of an independent contractor.  The parties
<P>
cannot be seen as standing in any sort of agency relationship
with
<P>
one another, and CompuServe may not be held liable for any of
<P>
plaintiffs' claims on a theory of vicarious liability.  Cf. McNally
<P>
v. Yarnall, 764 F.Supp. 838, 852-53 (S.D.N.Y.1991).<BR>
<P>
VI. Need for Additional Discovery<BR>
<P>
 Plaintiffs also suggest, in their memorandum of law in opposition
<P>
to CompuServe's summary judgment motion, that additional discovery
<P>
is needed and should preclude the grant of summary judgment.
<P>
Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) provides that when the party opposing a motion
<P>
for summary judgment cannot &quot;present by affidavit facts essential
<P>
to justify the party's opposition, the court may refuse the
<P>
application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit
...
<P>
discovery to be had.&quot;  In order to persuade the Court to
grant a
<P>
request for additional discovery, plaintiffs would have to &quot;file
an
<P>
affidavit explaining (1) what facts are sought and how they are
to
<P>
be obtained, (2) how those facts are reasonably expected to create
<P>
a genuine issue of material fact, (3) what effort the affiant
has
<P>
made to obtain them, and (4) why the affiant was unsuccessful
in
<P>
those efforts.&quot;  Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. v. Department
<P>
of the Navy, 891 F.2d 414, 422 (2d Cir.1989) (citing Burlington
<P>
Coat Factory Warehouse Corp. v. Esprit De Corp., 769 F.2d 919,
926
<P>
(2d Cir.1985)).  The Court may reject a request for further
<P>
discovery pursuant to Rule 56(f) if no affidavit is filed or if
the
<P>
request is based on pure speculation as to what would be
<P>
discovered.  Burlington Coat Factory, 769 F.2d at 926-927.<BR>
<P>
  In the instant action, plaintiffs have failed to fulfill the
<P>
requirements enumerated by the Second Circuit in Hudson River
Sloop
<P>
Clearwater and Burlington Coat Factory.  Plaintiffs have simply
<P>
asserted, not in an affidavit but in their memorandum of law,
that
<P>
&quot;[l]ittle in the way of discovery has been undertaken&quot;
and that
<P>
&quot;CompuServe has produced documents in response to the plaintiff's
<P>
First Document Request, but no depositions of the parties have
<P>
taken place.&quot;  Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant
<P>
CompuServe's Motion for Summary Judgment at 2.  Plaintiffs have
not
<P>
specified what facts they wish to discover through depositions
or
<P>
other means and how these are to be obtained, how these are
<P>
reasonably expected to create a genuine issue of material fact,
<P>
what efforts they have made to obtain these facts, or why they
have
<P>
been unsuccessful in their efforts.  Plaintiffs have therefore
not
<P>
made a showing sufficient to persuade the Court to deny
<P>
CompuServe's motion for summary judgment or to order a continuance
<P>
to allow further discovery to take place.<BR>
<P>
                              Conclusion<BR>
<P>
For the reasons stated above, CompuServe's motion for summary
<P>
judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 is granted on all claims
<P>
asserted against it.<BR>
<P>
SO ORDERED<BR>
<BR>
<P>
 Footnotes<BR>
<P>
 1. Civil Rule 3(g) of the Local Rules of this District requires
<P>
that a party moving for summary judgment provide a statement of
the
<P>
material facts as to which it contends there is no genuine issue
to
<P>
be tried.  Rule 3(g) further requires that the non-movant file
a
<P>
statement of the material facts as to which it contends there
is a
<P>
genuine issue to be tried, and provides that facts set forth in
the
<P>
movant's 3(g) statement that are uncontroverted by the non-movant's
<P>
statement are deemed to be admitted.  CompuServe's 3(g) statement
<P>
contends that there is no genuine issue to be tried as to the
fact
<P>
that &quot;CompuServe has no opportunity to review Rumorville's
contents
<P>
before DFA 'uploads' it into CompuServe's computer banks, from
<P>
which it is instantaneously available to approved CIS subscribers.&quot;
<P>
Plaintiffs do not, in their 3(g) statement or elsewhere, controvert
<P>
this material fact; therefore, it is deemed admitted pursuant
to
<P>
Rule 3(g).  See General Electric Co. v. New York State Department
<P>
of Labor, 936 F.2d 1448, 1452 (2d Cir.1991);  Dusanenko v. Maloney,
<P>
726 F.2d 82, 84 (2d Cir.1984).<BR>
<P>
 2. The New York Court of Appeals distinguished this type of
<P>
defamation in the commercial context from &quot;product disparagement,&quot;
<P>
which involves a false statement that &quot;is confined to denigrating
<P>
the quality of the business' goods or services&quot; and requires
that
<P>
malice and special damages be proven.  Ruder &amp; Finn, 52 N.Y.2d
at
<P>
670-71, 422 N.E.2d at 521-22, 439 N.Y.S.2d at 861-62.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
3. Plaintiffs also contend, as part of the business disparagement
<P>
claim, that (unspecified) &quot;defendants ... took affirmative
action
<P>
to initiate telephone calls to other data base systems and inform
<P>
these systems that plaintiffs were 'computer hackers' and ran
a
<P>
scam operation.&quot;  Complaint, P 19.  These alleged telephone
calls
<P>
do not, however, have any bearing on CompuServe's liability for
<P>
statements contained in the Rumorville publication.  Moreover,
<P>
plaintiffs have not contested CompuServe's denial of any
<P>
involvement on the part of its agents or employees in the alleged
<P>
phone calls.  See Kent Aff., sworn to on April 4, 1991, P 9.
<P>
Therefore, even if some person or persons did make the alleged
<P>
phone calls, that fact does not prevent CompuServe from prevailing
<P>
on its summary judgment motion.
<P>

<P>
PRODIGY SERVICES COMPANY, a

Partnership of Joint Venture with

IBM CORPORATION and SEARS-ROEBUCK &amp;
<P>

<P>
                         Defendant(S).<BR>
<P>
The following papers read on this motion:<BR>

<P>
     Upon the foregoing papers, it is ordered that this
<P>
motion by Plaintiffs for partial summary judgment against
<P>
Defendant PRODIGY SERVICE COMPANY (&quot;PRODIGY&quot;) is granted
and
<P>
this Court determines, as a matter of law, the following two
<P>
disputed issues as follows:<BR>
<P>
     (I)  that PRODIGY was a &quot;publisher&quot; of statements
<P>
concerning Plaintiffs on its &quot;Money Talk&quot; computer bulletin
<P>
board for the purposes of Plaintiffs' libel claims; and,<BR>
<P>
     (ii) that Charles Epstein, the Board Leader of
<P>
PRODIGY's &quot;Money Talk&quot; computer bulletin board, acted
as
<P>
PRODIGY's agent for the purposes of the acts and omissions
<P>
alleged in the complaint.<BR>
<P>
     At issue in this case are statements about Plaintiffs
<P>
made by an unidentified bulletin board user or &quot;poster&quot;
on
<P>
PRODIGY's &quot;Money Talk&quot; computer bulletin board on October
<P>
23rd and 25th of 1994. These statements included the
<P>
following:<BR>
<P>
     (a) STRATTON OAKMONTH, INC. (&quot;STRATTON&quot;), a securities
<P>
investment banking firm, and DANIKI PORUSH, STRATTON's
<P>
president, committed criminal and fraudulent acts in
<P>
connection with the initial public offering of stock of
<P>
Solomon-Page Ltd.,
<P>
     (b) the Solomon-Page offering was a &quot;major criminal
<P>
fraud&quot; and &quot;100% criminal fraud&quot;;
<P>
     (c) PORUSH was &quot;seen to be proven criminal&quot;; and,
<P>
     (d) STRATTON was a &quot;cult of brokers who either lie for
<P>
a living or get fired.&quot;
<P>
Plaintiffs commenced this action against PRODIGY, the owner
<P>
and operator of the computer network on which the statements
<P>
appeared, and the unidentified party who posted the
<P>
aforementioned statement. The second amended complaint
<P>
alleges ten (10) causes of action, including claims for per
<P>
se libel. On this motion, &quot;in order to materially advance
<P>
the outcome of this litigation&quot; (Zamansky affidavit, par.
<P>
4), Plaintiffs seek partial summary judgment on two issues,
<P>
namely:
<P>
     (1) whether PRODIGY may be considered  &quot;publisher&quot;
of
<P>
the aforementioned statements; and,
<P>
     (2) whether Epstein, the Board Leader for the computer
<P>
bulletin board on which the statements were posted, acted
<P>
with actual and apparent authority as PRODIGY's &quot;agent&quot;
for
<P>
the purpose of the claims in this action.<BR>
<P>
     By way of background, it is undisputed that PRODIGY's
<P>
computer network has at least two million subscribers who
<P>
communicate with each other and with the general subscriber
<P>
population on PRODIGY's bulletin boards. &quot;Money Talk&quot;
the
<P>
board on which the aforementioned statements appeared, in
<P>
allegedly the leading and most widely read financial
<P>
computer bulletin board in the United States, where members
<P>
can post statements regarding stocks, investments and other
<P>
financial matters. PRODIGY contracts with bulletin Board
<P>
Leaders, who, among other things, participate in board
<P>
discussions and undertake promotional efforts to
<P>
encourage usage and increase users. The Board Leader for
<P>
&quot;Money Talk&quot; at the time the alleged libelous statements
<P>
were posted was Charles Epstein.<BR>
<P>
     PRODIGY commenced operations in 1990. Plaintiffs base
<P>
their claims that PRODIGY is a publisher in large measure on
<P>
PRODIGY's stated policy, starting in 1990, that it was a
<P>
family oriented computer network. In various national
<P>
newspaper articles written by Geoffrey Moore, PRODIGY's
<P>
Director of Market Programs and Communications, PRODIGY held
<P>
itself out as an online service that exercised editorial
<P>
control over the content of messages posted on its computer
<P>
bulletin boards, thereby expressly differentiating itself
<P>
from its competition and expressly likening itself to a
<P>
newspaper. (see, Exhibits I and J to Plaintiffs' moving
<P>
papers.) In one article PRODIGY stated:<BR>
<P>
     &quot;We make no apology for pursuing a value
<P>
     system that reflects the culture of the
<P>
     millions of American families we aspire to
<P>
     serve. Certainly no responsible newspaper
<P>
     does less when it carries the type of
<P>
     advertising it published, the letters it
<P>
     prints, the degree of nudity and unsupported
<P>
     gossip its editors tolerate.&quot;
<P>
(Exhibit J.)<BR>
<P>
     Plaintiffs characterize the aforementioned articles by
<P>
PRODIGY as admissions (see, Dettner v Pokoik, 81 AD2d 572,
<P>
app. demd. 54 NY2d 750)  and argue that, together with
<P>
certain documentation and deposition testimony, these
<P>
articles establish Plaintiffs' prima facie case. In
<P>
opposition, PRODIGY insists that its policies have changed
<P>
and evolved since 1990 and that the latest article on the
<P>
subject, dated February, 1993, did not reflect PRODIGY's
<P>
policies in October, 1994, when the allegedly libelous
<P>
statements were posted. Although the eighteen month lapse of
<P>
time between the last article and the aforementioned
<P>
statements is not insignificant, and the Court is wary of
<P>
interpreting statements and admissions out of context, these
<P>
considerations go solely to the weight of this evidence.<BR>
<P>
     Plaintiffs further rely upon the following additional
<P>
evidence in support of their claim that PRODIGY is a
<P>
publisher:
<P>
     (A) promulgation of &quot;content guidelines&quot; (the
<P>
&quot;Guidelines&quot; found at Plaintiff's Exhibit F) in which,
<P>
inter alia, users are requested to refrain from posting
<P>
notes that are &quot;insulting&quot; and are advised that &quot;notes
that
<P>
harass other members or are deemed to be in bad taste or
<P>
grossly repugnant to community standards, or are deemed
<P>
harmful to maintaining a harmonious online community, will
<P>
be removed when brought to PRODIGY's attention&quot;; the
<P>
Guidelines all expressly state that although &quot;Prodigy is
<P>
committed to open debate and discussion on the bulletin
<P>
boards,  ...  this doesn't mean that 'anything goes'&quot;;
<P>
     (B) use of a software screening program which
<P>
automatically prescreens all bulletin board postings for
<P>
offensive language;
<P>
     (B) the use of Board Leaders such as Epstein whose
<P>
duties include enforcement of the Guidelines, according to
<P>
Jennifer Ambrozek,
<P>
the Manager of PRODIGY's bulletin boards and the person at
<P>
Prodigy responsible for supervising the Board Leaders (see
<P>
Plaintiffs'  Exhibit R, Ambrozek deposition transcript. at
<P>
p. 191) and
<P>
     (b) testimony by Epstein as to a tool for Board Leaders
<P>
known as an &quot;emergency delete function&quot; pursuant to
which a
<P>
Board Leader could remove a note and send a previously
<P>
prepared message of explanation &quot;ranging from solicitation,
<P>
bad advice, insulting, wrong topic, off topic, bad taste,
<P>
etcetera.&quot; (Epstein deposition Transcript, p. 52).
<P>
     A finding that PRODIGY is a publisher is the first
<P>
hurdle for Plaintiffs to overcome in pursuit of their
<P>
defamation claims because one who repeats or otherwise
<P>
republishes a libel is subject to liability as if he had
<P>
originally published it. In contrast, distributors such as
<P>
book stores and libraries may be liable for defamatory
<P>
statements of others only if they knew or had reason to know
<P>
of the defamatory statement at issue. A distributor or
<P>
deliverer of defamatory material is considered a passive
<P>
conduit and will not be found liable in the absence of
<P>
fault. However, a newspaper, for example, is more than
<P>
a passive receptacle or conduit for
<P>
news, comment and advertising. [as to the content of the
<P>
paper constitute Miami Herald Publishing Co. v Tornillo, 418
<P>
US 241, 258.] The choice of material to go into a newspaper
<P>
and the decisions made as to the content of the paper
<P>
constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment.
<P>
(Id.)., and with this editorial control comes increased
<P>
liability. (See Cubby, supra.) In short, the critical issue
<P>
to be determined by this Court is whether the foregoing
<P>
evidence established a prime facie case that PRODIGY
<P>
exercised sufficient editorial control over its computer
<P>
bulletin boards to render it a publisher with the same
<P>
responsibilities as a newspaper.<BR>
<P>
     Again, PRODIGY insists that its former policy of
<P>
manually reviewing all messages prior to posting was changed
<P>
&quot;long before the messages complained of by Plaintiffs were
<P>
posted&quot;. (Schneck affidavit, par. 4.) However, no
<P>
documentation or detailed explanation of such a change, and
<P>
the dissemination of news of such a change, has been
<P>
submitted. In addition, PRODIGY argues that in terms of
<P>
sheer volume--currently 60,000 messages a day are posted on
<P>
PRODIGY bulletin boards--manual review of messages is not
<P>
feasible. While PRODIGY admits that Board Leaders may remove
<P>
messages that violate its Guidelines, it claims in
<P>
conclusory manner that Board Leaders do not function as
<P>
&quot;editors&quot;. Furthermore, PRODIGY argues generally that
this
<P>
Court should not decide issues that can directly impact this
<P>
developing communications medium without the benefit of a
<P>
full record, although it fails to describe what
<P>
further facts remain to be developed on this issue of
<P>
whether it is a publisher.<BR>
<P>
     As for legal authority, PRODIGY relies on the Cubby
<P>
case, supra. There the defendant CompuServe was a computer
<P>
network providing subscribers with computer related services
<P>
or forums including an online general information service or
<P>
&quot;electronic library&quot;. One of the publications available
on
<P>
the Journalism Forum carried defamatory statements about the
<P>
Plaintiff, an electronic newsletter.  Interestingly, an
<P>
independent entity named Cameron Communications, Inc.
<P>
(&quot;CCI&quot;) had &quot;contracted to manage, review, create,
delete,
<P>
edit and otherwise control the contents of the Journalism
<P>
Forum in accordance with editorial and technical standards
<P>
and conventions of style as established by CompuServe&quot;. The
<P>
Court noted that CompuServe had no opportunity to review the
<P>
contents of the publication at issue before it was uploaded
<P>
into CompuServe's computer banks. Consequently, the Court
<P>
found that CompuServe's product was, &quot;in essence, an
<P>
electronic for-profit library&quot; that carried a vast number
of
<P>
publications, and that CompuServe had &quot;little or no
<P>
editorial control&quot; over the contents of those publications.
<P>
In granting CompuServe's motion for summary judgment, the
<P>
Cubby court held:<BR>
<P>
     A computerized database is the functional
<P>
     equivalent of a more traditional news vendor,
<P>
     and the inconsistent application of a lower
<P>
     standard of
<P>
     liability to an electronic news distributor
<P>
     such as CompuServe than that which is applied
<P>
     to a public library, book store, or newsstand
<P>
     would impose an undue burden on the free flow
<P>
     of information.<BR>
<P>
(776 F. Supp. 135, 140.)<BR>
<P>
     The key distinction between CompuServe and PRODIGY is
<P>
two fold. First, PRODIGY held itself out to the public and
<P>
its members as controlling the content of its computer
<P>
bulletin boards. Second, PRODIGY implemented this control
<P>
through its automatic software screening program, and the
<P>
Guidelines which Board Leaders are required to enforce. By
<P>
actively utilizing technology and manpower to delete notes
<P>
from its computer bulletin boards on the basis of
<P>
offensiveness and &quot;bad taste&quot;, for example, PRODIGY
is
<P>
clearly making decisions as to content (see, Miami Herald
<P>
Publishing Co. v Tornillo, supra), and such decisions
<P>
constitute editorial control. (Id.) That such control is not
<P>
complete and is enforced both as early as the notes arrive
<P>
and as late as a complaint is made, does not minimize or
<P>
eviscerate the simple fact that PRODIGY has uniquely
<P>
arrogated to itself the role of determining what is proper
<P>
for its members to post and read on its bulletin boards.
<P>
Based on the foregoing, this Court is compelled to conclude
<P>
that for the purposes of Plaintiffs' claims in the action,
<P>
PRODIGY is a publisher rather than a distributor.<BR>
<P>
     An interesting comparison may be found in Auvil v. CBS
<P>
60 Minutes (supra), where apple growers sued a television
<P>
network and local affiliates because of an allegedly
<P>
defamatory investigative report generated by the network and
<P>
broadcast by the affiliates. The record established that the
<P>
affiliates exercised no editorial control over the broadcast
<P>
although they had the power to do so by virtue of their
<P>
contract with CBS, they had the opportunity to do so by
<P>
virtue of a three hour hiatus for the west coast
<P>
differential, they had the technical capability to do so,
<P>
and they in fact had occasionally censored network
<P>
programming in the past, albeit never in connection with &quot;60
<P>
Minutes&quot;. The Auvil court found:<BR>
<P>
     It is argued that these features, coupled with the
<P>
     power to censor, triggered the duty to censor.
<P>
     That is a leap which the Court is not prepared to
<P>
     join in.
<P>
                             ...<BR>
<P>
     ... plaintiffs' construction would force the
<P>
     creation of full time editorial boards at local
<P>
     stations throughout the country which possess
<P>
     sufficient knowledge, legal acumen and access to
<P>
     experts to continually monitor incoming
<P>
     transmissions and exercise on-the-spot
<P>
     discretionary calls or face $75 million dollar
<P>
     lawsuits at every turn. That is not realistic.<BR>
<P>
                             ...
<P>
     More than merely unrealistic in economic terms, it
<P>
     is difficult to imagine a scenario more chilling
<P>
     on the media's right of expression and the
<P>
     public's right to know.<BR>
<P>
(ACO F. Supp. at 931-932.) Consequently, the court dismissed
<P>
all claims against the affiliates on the basis of &quot;conduit
<P>
liability&quot;, which could not be established therein absent
<P>
fault, which was not shown.<BR>
<P>
In contrast, here PRODIGY has virtually created an editorial
<P>
staff of Board Leaders who have the ability to continually
<P>
monitor incoming transmissions and in fact do spend time
<P>
censoring notes. Indeed, it could be said that PRODIGY's
<P>
current system of automatic scanning, Guidelines and Board
<P>
Leaders may have a chilling effect on freedom of
<P>
communication in Cyberspace, and it appears that this
<P>
chilling effect is exactly what PRODIGY wants, but for the
<P>
legal liability that attaches to such censorship.<BR>
<P>
Let it be clear that this Court is in full agreement with
<P>
Cubby and Auvil, Computer bulletin boards should generally
<P>
be regarded in the same context as bookstores, libraries and
<P>
network affiliates. [See Edward V. DiLello, Functional
<P>
Equivalency and the application to Freedom of Speech on
<P>
Computer Bulletin Boards, 26 Colum. J. Law &amp; Soc. Probs.
<P>
199, 210-213 (1993),] It is PRODIGY's own policies,
<P>
technology and staffing decisions which have altered the
<P>
scenario and mandated the finding that it is a publisher.<BR>
<P>
     PRODIGY's conscious choice, to gain the benefits of
<P>
editorial control, has opened it up to a greater liability
<P>
than CompuServe and
<P>
other computer networks that make no such choice. For the
<P>
record, the fear that this Court's finding of publisher
<P>
status for PRODIGY will compel all computer networks to
<P>
abdicate control of their bulletin boards, incorrectly
<P>
presumes that the market will refuse to compensate a network
<P>
for its increased control and the resulting increased
<P>
exposure. [See, Eric Schlachter, Cyberspace, The Free Market
<P>
and The Free Marketplace of Ideas: Recognizing Legal
<P>
Differences in Computer Bulletin Board Functions, 16
<P>
Hastings Communication and Entertainment L.J., 87, 138-139.)
<P>
Presumably PRODIGY's decision to regulate the content of its
<P>
bulletin boards was in part influenced by its desire to
<P>
attract a market it perceived to exist consisting of users
<P>
seeking a &quot;family-oriented&quot; computer service. This decision
<P>
simply required that to the extent computer networks provide
<P>
such services, they must also accept the concomitant legal
<P>
consequences. In addition, the Court also notes that the
<P>
issues addressed herein may ultimately be preempted by
<P>
federal law if the Communications Decency Act of 1995,
<P>
several versions of which are pending in Congress, is
<P>
enacted. [See, Congressional Quarterly US S 652,
<P>
Congressional Quarterly US HR 1004, and Congressional
<P>
Quarterly US S314.]<BR>
<P>
     The Court now turns to the second issue presented here,
<P>
of whether Epstein was PRODIGY's agent for the purposes of
<P>
the acts and omissions alleged in the complaint. Agency is a
<P>
legal relationship which results from the manifestation of
<P>
consent of one person to allow another
<P>
to act on his or her behalf and subject to his or her
<P>
control, and consent by the other to so  act. [Maurille v.
<P>
Park Slope U-Maul, 194 AD2d 142; Restatement (Second) of
<P>
agency *1 .] The starting point for an agency analysis in
<P>
this case is the &quot;Bulletin Board Leader Agreement&quot; (&quot;the
<P>
Agreement&quot; found at Exhibit A to Opposition Affidavit of
<P>
William C. Schneck) between PRODIGY and Epstein.  This
<P>
Agreement sets forth eleven specific responsibilities
<P>
expected of a Board Leader including (I) the posting of a
<P>
minimum of 120 notes on the bulletin board each month; (II)
<P>
working with member Representatives; (III) providing monthly
<P>
reports and (IV) following any additional procedures
<P>
provided by PRODIGY. The Agreement also requires prior
<P>
PRODIGY approval of all promotional efforts.  In addition,
<P>
the Agreement contains the following language<BR>
<P>
     Although you will not be a PRODIGY
<P>
     representative, your actions as Board Leader
<P>
     will still reflect on PRODIGY.<BR>
<P>
     You will be solely responsible for all of
<P>
     your actions as a Board Leader.  While
<P>
     PRODIGY will certainly support your actions
<P>
     as a Board Leader as a general matter (so
<P>
     long as they are not in breach of this
<P>
     Agreement), we will not assume any liability
<P>
     for anything you do (or fail to do) as a
<P>
     Board Leader.  You hereby indemnify and agree
<P>
     to hold PRODIGY harmless from and against all
<P>
     claims cost, liabilities judgments ...
<P>
     arising out of or in connection with anything
<P>
     you do ...
<P>
                         . . .
<P>
     Being a Board Leader does not make you a
<P>
     PRODIGY Services Company employee,
<P>
     representative or agent, and you agree not to
<P>
     claim or suggest that you are one.<BR>
<P>
     PRODIGY relies on this language to extricate itself from
any
<P>
alleged agency relationship with Epstein.  However,
<P>
talismanic language does not determine an agency
<P>
relationship. [Matter of Shulman Transport Enterprises,
<P>
Inc., 33 B.R. 383, 365, aff'd 744 Fzd 293.) The Court  must
<P>
look to the substance of the relationship. (fd.) Where one
<P>
party retains a sufficient degree of direction and control
<P>
over another, a principal-agent relationship exists. [Garcia
<P>
v Herald Tribune Fresh Air Fund, Inc., 51 Ad2d *97.] In
<P>
addition, whether one is an independent contractor is not
<P>
determinative of whether one is an agent. [Columbia
<P>
Broadcasting System, Inc. v Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 522 F2d
<P>
369, Ackert v *******, 29 Misc2d 962, aff'd 20 AD2d *50.]<BR>
<P>
     As to the substance of the relationship between PRODIGY and
<P>
its Board Leaders, PRODIGY Security Officer McDowell
<P>
testified that Board Leaders are required to follow the
<P>
Guidelines and the PRODIGY performs a &quot;management function&quot;
<P>
with respect to the activities of the Board Leaders.
<P>
(McDowell deposition transcript p. 78 found at Exhibit S to
<P>
the moving papers.) Furthermore, Epstein's Supervisor,
<P>
Jennifer Ambrozek , testified that PRODIGY reviews the
<P>
Guidelines with Board Leaders, who are then required to
<P>
enforce the Guidelines. (Ambrozek deposition transcript pp.
<P>
23 and 191, found at Exhibit R to the moving papers.) Board
<P>
Leaders are also given a 28 page &quot;Bulletin Board Leader
<P>
Survival Guide&quot; (Exhibit Q to the moving papers), dated
<P>
October 1994, wherein many technical terms and procedures
<P>
are explained, and the following caveat is given:<BR>
<P>
     IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SOMETHING IS OR WHAT IT'S
<P>
     SUPPOSED TO DO, LEAVE IT ALONE UNTIL YOU CAN ASK.<BR>
<P>
     Where the facts are not disputed the question of agency
<P>
should be resolved by the court. [Plymouth Rock Fuel Corp. v
<P>
Leucedia Inc., 100 AD2d 842.] This is such a case. The
<P>
aforementioned testimony by PRODIGY employees and
<P>
documentation generated by PRODIGY, together with the
<P>
Guidelines themselves, cannot be disputed by PRODIGY and
<P>
leave no doubt that at least for the limited purpose of
<P>
monitoring and editing the &quot;Money Talk&quot; computer bulletin
<P>
board, PRODIGY directed and controlled Epstein's actions. In
<P>
reaching this conclusion the Court has taken care not to
<P>
rely on any testimony by Epstein, inasmuch as it is the
<P>
conduct of the principal which must create the impression of
<P>
authority, not the conduct of the agent. [See, Ford v Unity
<P>
Hosp., 32 NY2d 464, 273.] Based on the foregoing, the Court
<P>
holds that Epstein acted as PRODIGY's agent for the purposes
<P>
of the acts and omissions alleged in the complaint.<BR>
