	<font size=5>I</font>n 1611, Thomas Sutton, a gentleman of England, died, and left an estate to
charitable purposes, including the foundation of the famous Charterhouse. There
was some dispute as to the will, and Francis Bacon took occasion to address the
king a letter of advice respecting the proposed disposition of the property, as
in case the will was set aside the king would be heir. In that letter occurs a
passage which has a singular force here and now, where conditions exist not
unlike those indicated by Bacon. "Concerning the advancement of learning," he
writes, "I do subscribe to the opinion of one of the wisest and greatest men of
your kingdom: That for grammar schools there are already too many, and
therefore no providence to add where there is excess. For the great number of
schools which are in your Highness' realm doth cause a want, and doth cause
likewise an overflow, both of them inconvenient, and one of them dangerous. For
by means thereof they find want, in the country and towns, both of servants for
husbandry and apprentices for trade; and, on the other side, there being more
scholars bred than the state can prefer and employ, and the active part of that
life not bearing a proportion to the preparative, it must needs fall out that
many persons will be bred unfit for other vocations, and unprofitable for that
in which they are brought up; which fills the realm full of indigent, idle, and
wanton people, which are but materia rerum novarum."<p>

<p>

<p>

We are discovering something of the same want and overflow now, especially in
our cities. We need not even change Bacon's terms, though the words themselves
have a little different meaning. Now, as then, there are too many grammar
schools, or, what is more to the purpose, the grammar schools teach too much
grammar. Bacon complains that in his day the schools caused a want of farmers
and mechanics, and an overflow of clerkly people. Precisely this complaint must
be made at present. The tendency of our highly organized public-school system
is to discourage manual labor, and to multiply enormously the number of those
who seek to maintain themselves by the pen or by trade. The course of
instruction is almost exclusively intellectual in its scope, the time occupied
covers years when the training for mechanical pursuits naturally begins, and
the apparent prospect of a higher social pursuit leads to an aversion from the
humbler occupation. The result is that the mechanical arts suffer an indignity,
and boys who might have been fitted for good workmen become indifferent
book-keepers, clerks, and salesmen.<p>

<p>

<p>

Now a state rests for prosperity not upon its clerks, but upon its workmen; it
is the men who handle tools that contribute to its wealth and may be trusted
for its defense, and it is of the first importance that this class should be
trained not only in the arts, but in intelligence and character. But the
divorce of manual and mental education in our public schools tends to
perpetuate the separation out of school. If there is intelligence in the
workman and a capacity to improve his art, these are not the distinguished
results of the training which the public schools give; that training steadily
withdraws the young from mechanical and agricultural pursuits, and crowds them
into occupations already overstocked, which depend for their prosperity indeed
upon the development of the arts. When a time of depression or disorder comes,
great numbers are cast out of employment, with no resources of industry, and
the state becomes full of "indigent, idle, and wanton people."<p>

<p>

<p>

Moreover, the public-school system not being found favorable to the mechanic
arts, what great educational force remains? The apprentice system has nearly
disappeared. It has declined contemporaneously with the rise and encouragement
of a compulsory public-school system, and the two facts are related more
closely than by the accident of time. It is true that we must look for the
chief cause of this decline to the introduction of steam power, which has led
to the formation of associated industries, and the breaking up of labor into
fragments. The rapid changes in society also have made the old relation of
master and apprentice unlikely; but neither the introduction of machinery nor
the multiplication of grades between the contractor and the workman has
lessened the necessity for skilled labor, or rendered the trained workman a
superfluous member of a great state. On the contrary, since the natural forces
which conspire to sustain the arts have temporarily given way to a new
discovery, it becomes more necessary to organize in their defense; but the
chief organization upon which the state relies is found insufficient, if not
positively antagonistic.<p>

<p>

<p>

The economic consideration which would persuade us to introduce into the
public-school system a recognition of manual training are reenforced by the
discovery of a yet higher argument in the very nature of education itself. It
is not to be wondered at that our school system should have grown into a purely
intellectual order. In its beginning there was no assumption of an entire
control of the child. So much time was given school as could be spared from the
farm and shop. There still existed a well-recognized tradition of mechanical
knowledge, and the school was looked upon as supplying those rudiments which
could best be acquired there. Gradually, as cities grew, increasing thus the
class of children who had no other employment, school came to be the chief
occupation of the young. Then the discharge upon our shores of an illiterate
foreign population excited alarm lest ignorance should get in the majority, and
we made haste to compel the children of this class into the public schools. The
attention of the community becoming more concentrated on this important
institution of the state, the existing apparatus for instruction was improved
and refined: the school-book industry was developed, and normal school
established for the better education of teachers who were to stand behind these
school-books. The pride of the state, the enthusiasm of teachers, the natural
quickness of children at leisure, these have all helped to swell the tide of
the public-school system, and to carry it on in the direction of its first
setting. <p>

<p>

<p>

Now that all this has been done and the elementary truths of society begin to
assert themselves, we shall discover that in neglecting the education of the
hand we have not only weakened the power of the state, but have stimulated an
unbalanced education of the person. A training which ignores the hand is not
the training which either nature or history will approve. That member is
something more than a symbol of industry. "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,
do it with thy might," "Establish Thou the work of our hands," are not phrases
ingeniously contrived to translate into the vernacular the intellectual
exercises of clerks and commercial travelers; they point to an elemental
condition of human well-being. Nor is this training of the hand to be obtained
by means of gymnastic swinging of dumb-bells. The training of the hand means
the power to use a tool; the training of the eye is the power to see perfect
work; the training of the mind is the power to conceive and execute that
work.<p>

<p>

<p>

The curing of the defect in society and the restoration of education to a sound
and healthful condition are to be sought in a reformation of that system which
we justly regard as the very engine of the state's prosperity. Nor are signs
lacking that the public mind is turning in that direction. The introduction of
drawing into the curriculum is one sign, and it is curious to observe how the
double argument, drawn from economy and from the philosophy of education, has
been used in support of this measure. The introduction of sewing for girls is
even more significant. Here the argument has been drawn chiefly from the
economic side, and the facts which gave the argument its force were
unassailable; but no one who appreciates the full meaning of education can help
seeing how valuable an element was introduced into the education of girls in
Boson when sewing was made a regular part of public-school training.<p>

<p>

<p>

This study of sewing forces upon one the question of the manual education of
boys. The question is precisely the same, only its solution is more
complicated.  To the girl is given one tool, and the perfect mastery of that
carries with it a training in thoroughness, order, concentration, precision,
and self-respect; the practice, moreover, is easily associated with a daily
need, and the charm of useful production is attendant on the study. But there
is no one tool which can be affirmed of the boy, and this is sometimes taken as
an excuse for not teaching him the use of any. Yet the variety of tools which a
boy may use only suggests practical difficulties; it does not declare these
difficulties insurmountable, nor in any way weaken the force of the educational
argument. The difficulties indeed are such as yield readily to an intelligent
will. Half of the question is answered when one considers that the primary
object of manual education in the public schools is not to make boys
carpenters, ship-builders, masons, or followers of any other craft, but to
instruct them in the meaning of their hands and of the tools which those hands
may grasp. Hence the shops of instruction, not of construction, and the
training will be in the grammar of the arts, not in the indefinite number of
forms which the arts assume.<p>

<p>

<p>

The various schools of technology which exist do not meet the general need
which we have described. Their business is to train masters and professional
mechanics; they do not make mechanics any more than colleges make book-keepers.
A graduate of a college may find himself finally in the position of an ordinary
clerk, and never rise above it; and so a graduate of the technological school
may prove at last only a journeyman; but neither college nor school exists for
these ends. Nor can the want be supplied by benevolent or evening schools.
These are but make-shifts. They could become important only as they drew life
out of the public schools. No; the remedy lies in such a readjustment of the
public-school system in our cities as shall make it include formal, progressive
instruction in the manual arts. If it be said that the state or the city has no
function to educate children for specific trades, but only to give them a
common-school education, as that term is now understood, it can be answered,
first, that the present system does almost inevitably educate children for the
desk and the counter, with a reversion in many cases of the almshouse or the
police-station; and, second, that there is nothing in the present reach of
common-school education which need compel us to glorify it as the final and
perfect force for developing the human character. In truth, we might better ask
humbly why the present system has failed than boast of its success. Nor should
we be far wrong if we were to assert that in making common such an education as
we have outlined we are likely to produce citizens who in peace would be more
valuable, working in shops, and not waiting behind counters, and whose training
would make them better soldiers in war. The drill of school-boys with the saw,
the plane, the axe, and the file would make them stronger defenders of the
state than if they had known only the manual exercise of the school-room, or
even had been formed into battalions of miniature soldiers.

		HE city pool was full of children that day, but I don't think that's

what bothered me. I was fourteen and happy to be out with my friends. It was

sunny but cool for mid-July in Iowa. A breeze flipped up the edges of our beach

towels as we lined them up on the crumbling cement, anchoring them with clogs,

a bottle of coconut oil, and a transistor radio that seemed to play nothing but

Sammy Davis Jr. singing "The Candy Man." My friends flopped down on their backs

and fell asleep, but I couldn't relax. I sat cross-legged in my faded bikini, a

hand-me-down from my sister, Daisy.<p>



Daisy was lifeguarding, but she couldn't see me, didn't even know I was there.

She looked like a stranger, perched above the masses in her red tank suit and

mirror sunglasses, her nose a triangle of zinc oxide. In one month she was

going away to college, leaving me to take care of our father. I couldn't let

myself think about how dreary life would be without Daisy. I gazed out at the

pool, which was circular, with the deep part and diving island in the center. A

group of four or five children splashed around at the edge of the deep water,

shrieking and dunking one another. A smaller girl in a green one-piece bathing

suit dog-paddled near the splashers, barely keeping her chin above water. She

wanted to play too, but the other children--friends? neighbors? sisters and

brothers?--ignored her. Teenagers were doing cannonballs off the high board,

and their waves sloshed over her head. Nobody except me seemed to notice. The

girl was paddling as hard as she could, getting nowhere.<p>



I stood up and waded into the water, which reeked of chlorine, and began

swimming the breast stroke toward the group of children, holding my head up as

a snake does. The older kids moved off toward the slide, leaving the little

girl behind. When she saw me, she opened her eyes wide and reached out. I

didn't have a clue how to rescue someone. I took her hand, and she clawed her

way up my arm. She was on me like a monkey. Her legs swung up and wrapped

around my neck, dunking me, choking me. I tried to stand, but I couldn't touch

bottom. She kicked me hard, in the jaw. I shoved her away, but she held on to

me. I'd had enough of this kind of treatment. My hand gripped her head like a

rubber ball. I held her under water and watched her thin body squirming in its

green ruffled suit.<p>



Someone finally screamed, and the lifeguards began blowing their whistles.

Daisy dove from her chair in a red flash. Still I held the girl under. <i>It's

too late now</i> is the only thought I remember having. A man tackled me from

behind, and Daisy jerked the girl from the water. The man gripped me tightly to

his thick chest, as if I were trying to run away. Over on the cement Daisy

knelt beside the girl and gave her mouth-to-mouth. After a few seconds she

stood up, holding the squalling girl, stroking her wet hair. The ruffles on the

girl's suit were flipped up and plastered to her body. "Daisy," I called out.

When Daisy looked over at me, her face was slack with shock, and I realized

what I had done.<p>



Everything after that seemed nightmarish but inevitable. Daisy and I were taken

up to the pool manager's office, dripping wet, to sit in plastic chairs and

wait for the police. The detective who came wore a velour shirt and looked

familiar, like someone I might have seen at church. Daisy reported what had

happened in a businesslike voice, while I stared at the tufts of hair on my big

toes, wondering if I should shave them. <p>



The detective asked me if I had anything to add. "She tried to drown me first,"

I said. <p>



"That's not how the witnesses tell it," he said. <p>



I glanced over at Daisy. "Sorry," she said, ever the honest one. "I didn't see

that part."<p>



At my hearing we sat on a bench in front of the juvenile judge--first the

detective, then my father, hanging his head, then Daisy, her arm around my

father, and then me. My mother, who had washed her hands of us, didn't show.

Because of my previous record--shoplifting and truancy--the judge decided to

send me to the Cary Home, in Des Moines, for one school year.<p><br>



	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif" align=left

	 height=44 alt="T"></font>

	HE Cary Home for Girls was an elegant brick house 	tucked into a cul-de-sac at

the edge of an upper-class neighborhood. From the outside you'd never know it

contained six teenage delinquents and their live-in counselors. We bad girls

attended classes in the large attic of the house, ate pizza burgers, did

homework together, and watched reruns of <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show</i>. It

hardly felt like punishment. <p>



At night, though, things fell apart. I had relentless dreams about Lisa Lazar,

the little girl from the pool. She came to the Cary Home in her ruffled bathing

suit and invited me outside to play. When she smiled, crooking her finger at

me, I woke up terrified. I would stare at the buzzing streetlight outside my

bedroom window and wonder what someone like me was doing at the Cary

Home--someone who until recently had usually played by the rules, was fairly

popular, had a semi-cute boyfriend, and tried her best to get decent grades. <p>



In April, near the end of my stay at the Cary Home, my father called to tell me

that his sister, Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, was coming to see me. "She wants

to help out," he said. I'd never met my aunt before. She and my father

exchanged Christmas cards and birthday phone calls, but that was about it.

"Marie stays on the move--she's a wheeler-dealer" was my father's only

explanation for why we never saw her. I wasn't sure what a wheeler-dealer was,

but it sounded intriguing. <p>



On the evening of her visit I stepped into the living room and saw a fattish

woman in baggy shorts and huaraches sprawled on the sofa, snoring. I recognized

her dark curly hair and sharp features from an old photo I'd once found in my

father's desk at the <i>Magruder Times</i>, of which he was the editor--a photo

of my father and Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se as children, posing in chaps and

cowboy boots in front of some mountains in New Mexico, where they grew up. I

said, "Hello?" <p>



She bounced up, wide awake. "I'm your aunt Merry," she said, shaking my hand.

"M-e-r-r-y, as in Christmas."<p>



 We sat down across from each other, and she explained that she'd recently

changed her name to Merry because she'd moved to Columbus, Ohio. "Midwesterners

don't like anything Frenchy," she said.<p>



"That's true," I said. I was disappointed that she'd changed her name and

looked so ordinary and lived in Ohio. Out of the corner of my eye I saw my

roommate, the klepto, in the yard, peering in through the screen window. She

was sneaking out to meet her boyfriend, the arsonist. She bugged out her eyes

and flicked her tongue. I ignored her. I asked Merry, "Why'd you decide to come

see me?" <p>



"Brother said family could visit," she said. "And I'm family, last I

checked."<p>



"Thanks," I said. My parents had never once been to see me at the home. My

father was too ashamed, and my mother was too busy looking after her own

father, Smitty, who owned the <i>Times</i>. Daisy, who had postponed college

for a year, drove over every Sunday and took me out to the movies or to the

Frozen Custard. We always got teary when we said good-bye. She would ruffle my

hair and call me Squirt, willing me to be innocent again. <p>



"Listen, sugar," Merry said, leaning forward with her elbows on her knees. "I

called Brother last week 'cause I got the feeling something was wrong. He's

worried sick. I offered to look after you, just for the summer. Transitional

period. Before you go home."<p>



So they didn't want me back. "I committed a crime," I said. "That's why I'm

here."<p>



"Nice place, too." Merry looked around at our cozy living room, furnished in

Early American sofas and chairs that could swallow you whole. <p>



"I don't want to be in the way," I said. "Don't you have a family in Ohio?" I

knew she had been married twice and had stepchildren.<p>



"Oh, sure," she said. "But we won't be going to Ohio. We'll be staying out at

the homeplace, in New Mexico."<p>



My father had once written a piece for the newspaper about what it was like to

grow up on a ranch--haying, feeding livestock, planting and watering

alfalfa--but he never talked to us about New Mexico. His parents had been to

visit us a few times when I was little, but I barely remembered them. Now his

father was dead, and his mother was a sick old lady. "Why do we have to go out

there?" I asked Merry.<p>



She took my hand and squeezed it. One of her eyes was blue, the other green.

"I'm a psychic," she said. "You're going to be helping me with a job. Mom has

offered us the use of her home."<p>



"I tried to kill someone," I said. "A small child."<p>



"I know, sugar," Merry said. "You did an extremely vicious thing." She stood up

and slung her purse strap over her shoulder, as if that settled that.<p>



I was relieved, if only for a moment, to think that it did. <p>



<p>



<br>



		<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/A-small.gif" align=left

	 height=44 alt="A"></font>

	UNT Merry and I left for New Mexico the last week 	of June. In Kansas she

insisted that I drive her Lincoln Continental. I had my learner's permit, but

I'd never driven on the interstate. <p>



"Don't sweat it," Merry said. "The Queen Mary handles like a dream."<p>



I sat up straight, my hands gripping the wheel as we rolled across Kansas at 70

miles an hour. Merry propped her bare feet up on the dashboard, knees tucked

under her purple caftan. If I dropped down to 65, she would bark out, "What are

you waiting for? A tow?" If I sped up to 75, she'd imitate a police siren.<p>



But most of the time she talked about herself. "I wear different-colored

contacts," she said. "Throws people off balance. They pop out sometimes, but I

always find them. I have ESP. Had it since I was a kid. Once Brother lost his

G-Man ring, and I led him right to the spot, in the schoolyard, where it fell

off his finger. Unfortunately, someone had stepped on it by then. When I was

your age, Mom put me on the radio. My own psychic call-in show. I directed a

woman right to where her baby had wandered off to--the bottom of a well.

Brother was so jealous." <p>



I didn't want to reveal how eager I was to learn anything about my father. "Was

he?" I said in a neutral tone. <p>



"He was," Merry said. "He got stuck with all the chores. Didn't stand up for

himself. Held it all in, till he couldn't take it anymore." She started humming

"Rock of Ages" and stared out the window, letting me know she was finished with

that subject. <p>



We passed a muddy lot packed tight with cattle which seemed to go on for miles,

bigger than anything I'd ever seen in Iowa. Finally I asked Merry, "Do you

still have a radio show?"<p>



"Oh, no, but I still help people find things. They call me up from all over the

U.S. and Canada. Missing dogs are my specialty." She studied her feet and

wiggled her red-painted toenails.<p>



Merry was more childlike, and more self-confident, than any adult I'd ever

known. She didn't seem to realize, or care, how weird she was. I said, "How do

you find missing dogs?" Up ahead, in my lane, a station wagon was going much

too slow.<p>



"Pass him, pass him!" Merry yelled. We surged around the station wagon and

veered back into our own lane. Merry went on in her ordinary voice. "Say, for

example, some rich guy calls me from Indiana. He and his wife are missing their

yellow Lab, Captain Crunch. Someone stole him right out of his pen. Man and his

wife are distraught. Dog's a kid substitute. They've been offering a

two-thousand-dollar reward, but no leads. I'm quiet for a while, and then I

say, `Your dog is safe. I see a late-model Ford, dark green, with two men in

it. They drag Captain Crunch into their car. I see them driving to New Mexico.

They're taking the dog to Los Alamos, for research purposes. But they stop at a

convenience store in Espa&ntilde;ola, and the Captain escapes.' <p>



"'Thank God,' the man says. 'Where is he now?'<p>



"'I can't tell exactly,' I say. 'Put an ad in <i>The Santa Fe New Mexican</i>.

You'll find him.'<p>



"He says, 'Thank you, thank you,' and says he'll send me a check for my

commission." <p>



"Are you right all the time?" I felt as if Aunt Merry and I were aliens, flying

through the wheat fields in a spaceship. <p>



"One hundred percent of the time." She swiveled to face me, the gold trim

around the neck of her caftan glittering. "I can guarantee that somebody living

with her grandmother just outside Santa Fe will answer that ad, and the happy

couple will drive to New Mexico to pick up their dog. My little helper will

hand over most of the reward money to me, keeping a bit for herself. All the

time I'll be back in Ohio, so nobody can connect us. Not that these people ever

try. They might suspect they've been had, but they've got a new dog. Everyone's

happy. Even the dog."<p>



I glanced down at the pavement racing underneath us. "I thought you had a

gift."<p>



"I do," she said. "I know how to make a living."<p>



"I'm getting tired," I said. "My eyes aren't seeing very well."<p>



"At the next rest area pull over and take five."<p>



"What if you can't find a dog that looks like theirs?"<p>



"He's waiting at Mother's. Captain Crunch Junior." She swung her feet back up

on the dashboard. "It'll be an adventure, sugar," she said.<p>

		Y grandmother lived in a low brick house with tiny 	windows, surrounded by

ramshackle outbuildings that looked like they were floating in a sea of red

dirt. A few cottonwood trees punctuated the gray-green sagebrush. "This is a

ranch?" I asked Merry. <p>



"We used an irrigation system," Merry said.<p>



When we got out of the car, I saw a dog tied to the corner post of the front

porch. He was yellow, but he looked part Lab and part something else. He was

smaller than a Lab and had floppier ears. "They'll never believe this is their

dog," I said. He strained at the rope and wagged his tail. "Is that the best

you could find?" <p>



"Now, don't speak ill of our canine friend," Merry said. She took out of the

trunk of her car the two bags of groceries we'd just bought and thrust them

into my arms. Then she leaned farther into the trunk and emerged with a small

TV set. <p>



"What's that for?" I said.<p>



"For you," she said, and grinned. Her teeth were too white.<p>



Inside, while Merry unpacked the groceries, I wandered through the house. It

was nearly bare of furniture. I could find no evidence that my father or Merry

had ever lived there, not even a photograph. There were two rooms with single

beds and small dressers in them, and one of these bedrooms was strewn with a

woman's clothes. I tiptoed into another room, where my grandmother, balding and

feeble, lay in a hospital bed under a pile of old quilts. There was a smell

like sour milk. "Grandmother," I said. She lifted her head and yelled out, in a

surprisingly strong voice, "Run, run--the Baptists are after you." I backed

away. <p>



In the den Merry was bustling about in one corner, unplugging a TV set and

hoisting it from a table onto the floor. A slight red-haired woman wearing a

black jumpsuit leaned against the wall with her arms folded, watching Merry.

Merry was talking to the woman but not looking at her. "I figured you didn't

really need this fancy set," Merry said, "and we can really use it, what with

Dick's poor vision." She lifted the little TV she'd taken from the trunk and

set it on the tabletop. "There. That'll do fine."<p>



"Does it work?" the red-haired woman said.<p>



"Been working for years. Came from a motel liquidation."<p>



The woman snorted. "I guess it's black-and-white."<p>



"It's good quality," Merry said, patting the small TV like a pet. <p>



A little while later I stood out in the driveway. Merry sat behind the wheel of

her Lincoln, her elbow crooked out the window. She'd stayed only long enough to

unload my things and swap TVs, and now she was heading back to Ohio. I held on

to her door handle. It was getting dark. "I can't do it," I said. <p>



"It'll go as smooth as silk." Merry winked her green eye at me. "Read those

want ads every day, sugar. Should be any time. I'll be back before you know

it."<p>



I tried to think of something that would slow her down, if not stop her. "What

should I tell Dad?"<p>



"I wouldn't tell him anything." She started the car. "Considering your track

record. And his."<p>



"What'd he do?" I said, but she didn't seem to hear me. She stepped on the gas,

flicking her hand in a wave as she spun out onto the dirt road. <p>



I watched the red dust settling and thought about Iowa--our two-story white

house with its porch swing and sweet-smelling lawn that rolled under my tree

house down to the cornfield. At home on a summer evening the air would be full

of humidity and comforting sounds--crickets, country music from passing cars,

the distant voice of the baseball announcer at City Park. Daisy would be

cooking my father's dinner--maybe pork chops and baked potatoes. I couldn't

picture what my mother would be doing, because she lived with Smitty in his

Victorian house across town. For years Smitty and my mother had eaten breakfast

together every morning at the caf&eacute;, and every afternoon she had helped

him with his business affairs. Finally, after she'd spent all of Christmas Eve

and Christmas Day with Smitty, my father said to her in a joking voice, "You

like him better than you do us. Why don't you just move in with him?" She

called his bluff and did just that. Since Daisy had already taken over at our

house, it wasn't that much of a change. <p>



I stood there in the driveway till the sun had dropped behind the mountains.

Then I untied the dog and took him inside.<p>



<p>



<br>



	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/I-small.gif" align=left

	 height=44 alt="I"></font>	GOT into a routine right away. Every morning at	breakfast I read the

entire newspaper, saving the lost-and-found ads for last. When I'd finished my

Grape-Nuts, I put the bowl on the floor, and Captain Crunch Junior stepped up

and licked the bowl clean and then some, causing it to roll around the kitchen

floor.<p>



"You kids stop that racket!" my grandmother screamed from her bedroom. <p>



The red-haired woman, who turned out to be my grandmother's live-in nurse, sat

across the table from me, reading <i>Silent Spring,</i> by Rachel Carson. She

was half Mexican, her name was LeeAnn, she was forty-two, and her hair, she

told me, was naturally red.<p>



The first morning I was there, she'd said, "Aren't you going to get bored? How

long are you staying?"<p>



Merry hadn't warned me not to tell LeeAnn about our scheme, but I knew I

shouldn't. Besides, having a secret made me feel important. Merry had chosen me

to help her, and since I was in a position to help, why shouldn't I? "I'm here

on a rest cure," I told her. "For my mental health." <p>



"Well, then," LeeAnn said, "you'll fit right in." <p>



After breakfast I would grab an apple from the fridge and make three

peanut-butter sandwiches. In the living room, which was totally empty, I tied a

rope to Junior's collar and we set out for a walk down the dirt road toward the

mountains. Strange-looking houses lined the road--adobe houses with scraggly

yards from which dark-skinned people stared at me. Sometimes I pretended that

Lisa Lazar skipped along beside us, barefoot, in her silly green bathing suit.

The air was clear and dry, and the sky was so blue it almost hurt to look at

it. We strolled past cactus plants and lizards sunning themselves on white

rocks. To the south were rounded hills with ribbons of pink running through

them. The mountains loomed straight ahead. We walked and walked until I let

myself realize that we must be miles from my grandmother's house. Nobody knows

me here, I thought, and nobody knows where I am. That thought was a signal that

we'd gone far enough for one day. Junior and Lisa and I found shade under a

pine tree and split the sandwiches and the apple. <p>



When we got back, worn out and thirsty, we napped till dinnertime--frozen

dinners and Purina Dog Chow that Merry had left. In the evenings I watched the

little television in the den with LeeAnn, who was always doing something else

at the same time, like sewing a hem or balancing her checkbook. At seven she

spoon-fed my grandmother her applesauce, and at nine she gave her a sponge

bath. During commercials we talked about all kinds of things, including the

existence of God. Neither of us believed, although we both wanted to. I

couldn't bring myself to tell her about Lisa.<p>



One night, while we were watching <i>Nightmare Theater</i> and LeeAnn was

knitting a Nordic sweater, she told me she thought Merry was a sleazebag.

"She's sold off every antique, everything of value, in this house." <p>



"What's wrong with that, if nobody else wants it?" I said, realizing I sounded

just like Merry. "Merry looks out for herself," I said. "I kind of admire

that."<p>



LeeAnn shook her head, clacking her needles together. "I think it's disgusting.

At least wait till the poor thing's dead." <p>



"So why do you work here?"<p>



"I won't be here forever," she said. "Besides, I always liked Mrs. St. John. I

grew up down the road."<p>



"Did you know my father?" <p>



"He used to let me ride his pinto pony." She held up the front of her sweater

and admired it. "Merry used to make us kids march around in a parade just so

she could be the majorette. Your father was always helping people, fixing

things."<p>



This didn't sound like my father. Whenever he was home from his job at the

newspaper, he spent hours sitting in his chair, staring out the living-room

window at the cornfield behind our house, tapping his empty pipe on the edge of

the coffee table. Daisy would bring him fresh glasses of iced tea and rub his

shoulders, and sometimes he remembered to say "Thanks, honey." Their behavior

sickened and infuriated me, but I knew better than to let on.<p>



LeeAnn resumed her knitting. "You seem like such a well-adjusted kid," she

said. <p>



"Young adult," I said, and we both laughed.<p>



Later that night Junior hopped up onto my bed, settled himself on my feet, and

fell asleep. I lay awake, wondering what LeeAnn would think if she knew the

truth about my family and the horrible thing I'd done. I wondered if she'd

think I was crazy. Other people thought I was.<p>



After the incident with Lisa my father took me to a psychiatrist in Indianola.

He wore a hearing aid and kept asking me how I felt. "Fine," I kept saying,

feeling sorry for him. <p>



He sighed. "Is anything bothering you?" <p>



"Well," I said, "I keep wondering where that girl's parents were when she went

out into the deep water. Why weren't they watching her?" The psychiatrist wrote

something down in his notebook, and I knew I'd said the wrong thing.<p>



At night, after my father and Daisy were asleep, I would pace around our house,

shredding tissues and gasping for air. During the day, while they were at work,

I lay on the couch watching soap operas with the sound off. Once, my mother

dropped by, dressed in her pale-pink suit, my favorite, the one she wore to

Garden Club meetings. She sat down beside me on the couch, trying to appear

calm, but her eyes were fixed and tense, like a cat's. "The whole town knows

what you did," she said. "Do you realize your father had to publish an article

about it? In Smitty's paper?" My father had worked his way up to

editor-in-chief, but my mother never let us forget that Smitty owned the paper.

She grabbed my ankle and shook it. "Why would you attack that little girl? What

were you thinking?" <p>



I couldn't stand seeing my mother, the president of the Magruder Garden Club

and Ladies' Literary Society, behaving like this. I couldn't stand her helpless

hand-wringing. I said, "I hated that girl's frilly bathing suit." <p>



My mother burst into tears. "What's wrong with you?" she said, but she didn't

wait for an answer. She got up and ran out of the room.<p>



Junior, a hot weight at the end of the bed, let out a loud snore. I jerked my

feet out from under him, but he didn't wake up. I knew what was wrong with me,

and my mother did too, even though she pretended otherwise. I had become a

delinquent because I did not intend to take my turn as Daddy's nursemaid. I did

not intend to make myself useful. <p>



<p>



<br>



		<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/A-small.gif" align=left

	 height=44 alt="A"></font>FTER my first day in New Mexico I didn't go in to see my grandmother again.

It was too depressing. I never called home, and when they called me, I said I

was having a very educational experience. I told my father that Merry was off

on a short business trip--going to some motel liquidations--and that she'd left

me in the care of Grandmother's nurse, LeeAnn, and that LeeAnn had taken me

sightseeing on her days off. I mentioned some places I'd read about on the

back of the New Mexico state map. <p>



"How's Mom?" he asked me. <p>



"Sweet," I said. "But kind of confused." I told Daisy I'd bought a

square-dancing dress with the fifty dollars she'd given me, and she pretended

to be horrified. <p>



Once, my mother called and said that she'd seen Lisa's mother in the Jack and

Jill, and that Lisa was doing fine. "Outwardly," my mother added. Every night

Junior slept at the foot of my bed.<p>



The ad appeared after I'd been in New Mexico nearly a week. "Lost: Yellow Lab,

from a convenience store near Espa&ntilde;ola. Two years old. Goes by Captain

Crunch. Reward. Call Steve and Cyndi Richardson."<p>



That morning Junior and I walked past the horse pasture, past the school bus

converted into a house. We kept following the road when it turned and climbed

uphill through some pine trees. A hawk circled overhead, screeching. We'd never

gone this far before. Lisa turned and ran back down the hill. I realized that

the real Lisa no longer looked like the girl in the bathing suit. For one

thing, the bathing suit wouldn't fit. She was a year older. She was bigger,

taller, and smarter. <p>



Junior stopped and gazed back at me, questioning.<p>



"Lisa may not ever want to swim again," I said. "Did you know that?"<p>



He sat down on his haunches, his eyes fixed on my sack of sandwiches. <p>



The phone number in the ad was busy till 8:30 that night. "He showed up at my

door hungry and weak, like he'd walked a long way," I told Cyndi. "Does your

dog have a little white spot on the crown of his head?" Merry had coached me on

what to say.<p>



"Yes!" Cyndi shouted. "You're the first person who's mentioned the spot. I've

gotten four calls already, and nobody's mentioned the spot. It's him, Steve. We

found him!"<p>



"I'll send you a picture, so you'll know for sure." I tipped back in my chair,

feeling cocky. Merry had taken a picture of Junior, a tad blurry, and it was

already in an envelope with the address and a stamp on it.<p>



"You don't have to," Cyndi said. "I can tell by your voice that Crunch is right

there in the room. We'll be there in three days."<p>



"Three days?" I rocked my chair back down with a thud, which startled Junior,

who was sprawled out in front of the screen door. <p>



"Give him our love, will you?" Cyndi said. "Tell him we're on our way."<p>



"Would you like to tell him yourself?" But she'd already hung up. "Jesus H.

Christ," I said. Junior flopped his tail.<p>



"What was that all about?" LeeAnn stood in the kitchen doorway with her hands

on her hips. She wore gym shorts and a T-shirt that said ART WON'T HURT YOU. She

said, "What are you and Junior up to now?" She pronounced "Junior" in the

Spanish way, "<i>Hooneor</i>," and I loved to hear her say it.<p>



I said, "If you're a real nurse, how come you don't wear a uniform?"<p>



She said, "If you're not a Christian, how come you're talking to Jesus?

<i>Twilight Zone</i> is on. Grave robbers. Right up our alley." <p>



<p>

<br>



	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/D-small.gif" align=left

	 height=44 alt="D"></font>ON'T let them leave without him," Merry said	on the telephone later that

night. "And listen, sugar. About the reward money: Get cash. I'll give you a

third."<p>



"I don't want it." Talking to Cyndi, hearing her voice, had made me feel guilty

about tricking her.<p>



"I'll start a savings account for you," Merry said. "For college."<p>



"I'm not going to college."<p>



"Escape money, then. In case you get into another jam. You're impulsive, just

like Brother."<p>



So this could go on and on, I thought, this getting into one jam after another.

"Okay," I said. <p>



"See you on the weekend," Merry said.<p>



"But what if they know I'm lying?" <p>



"Remember: You're not saying he <i>is</i> their dog. You're just saying he

could be."<p>



I hung up and wandered into the den, where LeeAnn sat in the recliner,

finishing a crossword puzzle, her reading glasses perched on the end of her

nose. "Whatever you and Merry are cooking up," she said, "I don't want to know

about it."<p>



"It's a losing proposition," I said.<p>



"Six-letter word for nuts," LeeAnn said.<p>



"Insane." I flopped down on the hairy brown couch. <br>My bare thighs

immediately started itching. "What was my father really like?" I said. "Was he

some kind of rebel?"<p>



She lowered her newspaper. "Because he held up the liquor store?"<p>



I sank back into the couch, feeling queasy. After a while I said, "How long was

he in jail?"<p>



"Not a day," LeeAnn said. "Your grandfather got him and his football buddies

off scot-free. They were drunk when they did it, but still. Worst thing that

could've happened, him not being held responsible. He slunk off in the dead of

night and never came back."<p>



I closed my eyes.<p>



"Didn't you know?" LeeAnn said. "Shoot, I'm sorry. You acted like you did."<p>



"I knew," I said, and I felt as if I had. My father had committed a stupid

public act, left his home forever, and was still waiting for his comeuppance. I

might be doing the same thing if Merry hadn't come along. It was much smarter

to operate in the gray areas of life, the way Merry did. She would never cower;

she'd never wait around for anything. And she'd never get caught.<p>



<p>



<br>



	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/C-small.gif" align=left

	 height=44 alt="C"></font>YNDI called me at noon from Espa&ntilde;ola on the 

	 third 	day, and I gave her

directions to the house. Afterward I sat on the front porch in my white

sundress, drinking lemonade and telling myself I was the picture of

trustworthiness. LeeAnn had gone to the laundromat, and when she got back, I

was going to tell her that Junior's rightful owners had shown up out of the

blue to claim him. <p>



I gazed down the road. With Junior gone, I thought, I'd be too afraid to go on

hikes, and Lisa had grown up and left us. That's what I was focusing on

then--how bored I'd be without them.<p>



A dusty gray Volvo pulled into the driveway. Cyndi stepped out first, smoothing

down her flowered smock. She was very pregnant. "Tabitha?" she said, starting

toward me. That was the name I'd given. My alias.<p>



I set down my glass and jumped up to greet her. Confidence, I told myself.

Pretend you're Merry.<p>



Steve climbed out of the driver's side. He wore a sweaty T-shirt and running

shorts, as if he hadn't even bothered to change before heading off across the

country. He looked at me skeptically and didn't speak. I knew then that this

trip was Cyndi's idea.<p>



"Hello," I said, shaking Cyndi's damp hand. Her hair was long and wavy, pulled

back in a messy ponytail. She had a large, pleasant face. I said, "How was the

drive?"<p>



"Horrendous," Steve said. "Illinois. And then Missouri."<p>



"Would you like some lemonade?" I said.<p>



"Where is he?" Cyndi said. "Where's Crunch?" <p>



I'd shut Junior in my bedroom, thinking they should see him first in dim light.

"Resting," I said. "It's his nap time."<p>



When I opened the bedroom door, my knees were shaking. Junior reclined on my

bed like a prince. He raised his head but didn't get up. Cyndi gasped and

covered her mouth. <p>



Steve crouched on the floor. "Crunch. Come here, boy."<p>



Junior stared at them. "He doesn't remember us," Cyndi said, swaying on her

feet. "Is that possible?"<p>



"He's not awake yet," I said. "Wake up, Junior." He leaped up and pranced over

to sit on my foot. I said, "I've been calling him Junior."<p>



"Junior." Steve patted the floor. Junior went to Steve, wagging his tail. I

held my breath. Steve scratched Junior's ears and then inspected him all over,

even examining his teeth. Finally Steve looked up at me, but I couldn't read

his expression. "Thank you," he said gravely. <p>



Cyndi plopped down on my bed, her face pale. "I still can't believe it. I

haven't been able to sleep; my blood pressure's gone up. My due date's in six

weeks."<p>



"Sit," Steve said to Junior. Junior licked Steve's face. "Lie down," Steve

said. Junior jumped up and put his paws on Steve's shoulders. Steve said, "He

doesn't remember anything I taught him." <p>



"Dumb dog," I said. <p>



"Crunch," Cyndi called in a soft voice, and Junior trotted over and hopped up

on the bed beside her. "Now he remembers," she murmured, hugging him. "He

remembers. Hello, Crunch."<p>



<i>What if it really is Crunch?</i> I thought. <i>It could be. Or Crunch

reincarnated.</i> I started to cry, and I imagined Merry shaking her head in

disgust.<p>



"Are you sad about giving him up?" Cyndi said. "I'm sorry. I've been thinking

only about myself."<p>



"He's not Crunch," I said. "He's Junior. <i>Hooneor</i>."<p>



Cyndi frowned at Steve. "Where are your parents?" Steve said.<p>



"My grandmother." I gestured with my head. "She's senile." I wiped my nose on

the back of my hand and then wiped my hand on my dress.<p>



"I'm sure you're upset," Cyndi said. "You can get another dog."<p>



 "No," I said. "I'm trying to tell you. This dog came from the pound."<p>



Cyndi and Steve exchanged concerned looks. "We're just glad you found him,"

Cyndi said, scooping up Crunch and handing him over to Steve. Crunch lay

awkwardly in Steve's arms with his legs sticking straight out, and they both

stroked him under the chin. They didn't care whether or not Junior was Crunch.

They loved him no matter what.<p>



"I almost drowned someone," I said. "I was scared and I took it out on her."<p>



Cyndi patted my shoulder. "You'll be okay, Tabitha," Steve said. <p>



"My name's not Tabitha," I said. "It's really Sophie St. John. My parents sent

me out here from Iowa for the summer, but my grandmother doesn't even know me."

I stopped crying, and my heart began to pound. I could feel their generosity

infecting me. "You're not suckers," I said. "You're good people." <p>



"That's nice," Cyndi said. She turned to Steve. "We should get going." <p>



Crunch began to squirm, and Steve dumped him onto the floor. "I hate to leave

Sophie here," Steve said to Cyndi. "We could give her a ride back to Iowa. It's

on the way." <p>



Cyndi slipped her arm around Steve's waist and sagged against him, but she

didn't protest. I sensed they were playing some sort of game, a game in which

they took turns leading valiant, ill-conceived rescue missions. One proposed a

course of action that most people would consider absurd, and the other went

along as though it all made perfect sense. Their game, the kindness and

futility of it, and the way it bonded them together, made me like them even

more.<p>



"Why don't you call your parents?" Steve said. "We've got room in the car."<p>



I sat down on the edge of my bed and blew my nose, remembering the last time

I'd been home. Merry and I had swung by Magruder on our way to New Mexico. She

stayed in her Lincoln, listening to the radio, while I went inside. My mother

was there for the occasion. One by one they came forward and kissed me,

blank-faced, as if I were in my coffin and they'd already cried themselves out.

Daisy slipped me a fifty-dollar bill. "Buy yourself a summer dress," she said.

My father hugged me with one arm, his face turned away. "See you soon," my

mother said, opening the door like a hostess at a party. They seemed united,

more like a family, with me gone.<p>



Steve and Cyndi were watching me, waiting for my decision. "Thanks anyway," I

said.<p>



I followed them out onto the front porch, Junior trotting between them like

their long-lost son. Cyndi and Junior climbed into the car, but Steve stopped

in the driveway. "Is a check okay?"<p>



I had forgotten about the reward money. "Don't worry about it," I said. <p>



"That was the agreement," Steve said, turning toward the car. "I'll get my

checkbook."<p>



<p>



<br>



	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/D-small.gif" align=left

	 height=44 alt="D"></font>	URING the night my grandmother died in her sleep. 

	 	LeeAnn discovered her in

the morning and called the funeral home. After the coroner pronounced her dead,

the funeral-home men took her away, wrapped in one of her quilts. LeeAnn and I

spent all morning on the phone. We couldn't reach Merry. She was already on the

road somewhere between Ohio and New Mexico. My father said they would come out

to New Mexico as soon as they could get a flight.<p>



In the afternoon I asked LeeAnn if she wanted to go for a walk. The sky was

clouding up behind the mountains, but we set out anyway. "We get storms every

day in midsummer," LeeAnn said. "No biggie."<p>



"I never got to know Grandmother," I said. "I wish I felt sadder. I'll miss

Junior more than I will her." <p>



LeeAnn, striding along beside me in shorts and hiking boots, just nodded. It

had never occurred to me that LeeAnn would own a pair of hiking boots. It was

odd seeing her outside, in the daylight, moving along with such assurance that

she seemed to leave an impression in the air behind her, like an echo. I

realized she'd been walking on this road for years. "What are you going to do

now?" I asked her. "Where will you go?"<p>



"I've got a husband in Santa Fe," she said. "I need to make amends and move

on." <p>



I waited for her to elaborate, but she didn't. "Me too," I said. Someday I

would have to talk to Lisa, the real Lisa, face to face. A gust of wind kicked

up the dust around us, sending a plastic cup flying past our feet. We bowed our

heads and kept walking. Clouds rolled over us, and I felt the first drops of

rain. LeeAnn stopped and pointed to an adobe house with a rail fence around it.

I'd gotten used to seeing it every day on my walks. "That's where I used to

live," she said, and we stood there in the rain looking at the house, which was

for me transformed again into something mysterious. The windows in front were

open, and white lace curtains whipped in the wind.<p>



<p>



<br>



	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/W-small.gif" align=left

	 height=44 alt="W"></font>	HEN Merry pulled into the driveway that evening, I 	

	 left LeeAnn in the kitchen

and went out on the front porch to get it over with. Merry nosed her Lincoln

right up to the steps as if she were docking a boat. Then she climbed out,

brushing her hair from her eyes with a bejeweled hand. She was wearing the

purple caftan, which was stained between her breasts. Coffee or chocolate. "I'm

beat," she said. <p>



I sat down on the top porch step, wishing I didn't have to give her bad news.

<p>



She came up and sat on the step beside me. "Run get the money," she said.<p>



I forced myself to look in her eyes, which were both brown. "I've got a check,

made out to me. I think we should split it fifty-fifty." I'd practiced saying

this in front of the mirror, but even so my voice lacked authority. <p>



She sighed dramatically and dropped her head. "And I've got a funeral to pay

for." <p>



"How did you know about the funeral?"<p>



"I picked up negative vibes all across Missouri," she said, "but I didn't want

to believe them. Finally I pulled over and called Brother." <p>



We sat in silence, looking out at the sagebrush. My mouth was so dry I couldn't

swallow. Merry glanced at her watch. "Holy moley." She stood up and jumped off

the steps. "Help me get my stuff in, sugar," she said, dashing around to the

rear of her car. "Then we need to carry the furniture out of the house. A man's

coming for it in half an hour." She opened up the trunk and peered at me around

the lid. "We have to do it before Brother gets here. He'll try to lay claim to

the whole kit and caboodle." Her face disappeared and I could hear her

rummaging around in the trunk.<p>



I remembered what LeeAnn had said about Merry the majorette, making all the

kids march behind her in a parade. I could see there would never be a halt

unless I called it. "You're on your own, Aunt Merry." I hadn't practiced saying

this, but it sounded as if I had. <p>



Just then LeeAnn yelled through the open window, "Fried chicken!" <p>



Merry slammed her trunk shut and blew past me into the house. I went in behind

her, walking at a leisurely pace. <p>

	 height=44 alt="T"></font>	HE following summer, when I was sixteen, I got	a part-time job at the

Magruder city pool. They put me down in the basement of the rec center, next to

the locker rooms. I sat on a stool behind a battered wooden counter, collecting

admission fees and handing out wire baskets and locker keys attached to large

safety pins. Most of my earnings I put in a savings account I'd started with my

half of Steve and Cyndi's check. Escape money.<p>



One Saturday afternoon after a heavy rainfall, when the pool was virtually

empty, Lisa and her mother came through. Lisa's hair was cut in a bob, and she

wore a Speedo bathing suit. Her mother, a beautiful, haggard-looking woman,

trailed behind her, wearing thongs with big plastic daisies on them, smoking a

cigarette. <p>



"Hello, Lisa," I said. My face flushed, and I wished I'd kept my mouth shut.<p>



Lisa looked up. She didn't recognize me or even seem to wonder how I knew her

name. "Hi," she said. She grabbed her mother's hand and tugged. "I'm going off

the high dive. First thing."<p>



Her mother smiled at me and rolled her eyes. She didn't recognize me either.

"We got a show-off here." She slid some change across the counter. "The diving

board at the club isn't as high as this one."<p>



I held out their baskets and keys, and Mrs. Lazar took them. I had to say

something more to Lisa. "I'm the one who held you under water. Two summers

ago." I smiled idiotically. "Sorry." <p>



Lisa nodded. "Okay." She started running down the hall toward the women's

dressing room. "Cowabunga!" she yelled.<p>



A line was forming behind Mrs. Lazar. She glared at me, gearing herself up to

give me a piece of her mind, even though, I could tell, she'd rather not be

bothered. She took a drag of her cigarette. "I sincerely hope you got

rehabilitated up in Des Moines," she said.<p>



"I did," I said. "Completely."<p>



Kids in line were pushing and shoving. Mrs. Lazar kept glaring at me, waiting

for me to grovel. The ash on her cigarette was ready to drop onto my counter.<p>



"But then again," I said, "I might do the same thing any time. Or worse."<p>



"I see," she said. She turned and addressed a suntanned woman behind her. "I

guess they let anyone work here. This place used to have some class."<p>



"Hurry up," the suntanned woman barked.<p>



Mrs. Lazar shook her head in a world-weary way and flip-flopped off down the

hall, flicking her ash on the floor as she went.<p>



The suntanned woman handed me a crumpled dollar bill. "Some folks think they

run the world," she said. "If you know what I mean."<p>



"I do," I said. "I certainly do." <p>

	<font size=5>I </font> NEVER seem to have enough cognac in my
	bar. Despite my stock of grappa and fruit liqueurs, it is cognac my guests usually want after
dinner and keep drinking as conversation continues. Until recently I didn't
understand why, and in fact I didn't really know what cognac was. Then I gave
in to the nearly two years' worth of literate and aggressive letters I had
received from Ansley Coale Jr., a man in California whose company,
Germain-Robin, produces what wine writers I respect say might be the finest
cognac-style brandy not only in America but in the world. It takes its name
from the distiller, Hubert Germain-Robin, the scion of a cognac-making family
in France. Late last summer I went to Mendocino County, a hundred miles north
of San Francisco, to find out why so many guests drink me dry.<p>

Cognac, I learned, is not distilled from fruit, as poire is distilled from
pears and framboise from raspberries, nor is it distilled from the remnants of
the winemaking process--the stems and stalks that are the base of grappa and
its French cousin, marc. Instead cognac begins with fresh, unaged wine, and
after distillation it is perfectly clear--as is every distillate, or eau de
vie. The color and much of the flavor come from the oak barrels in which it
ages for anywhere from three years to a hundred or more. <p>
All cognac is brandy, but, as the French will remind you, not all <A HREF="http://www.isy.liu.se/~mikwe/brandy.html">brandy</A> is
cognac. Like Champagne, the French region of Cognac (along the Charente River
in the southwest of France, above Bordeaux) has zealously guarded its name; so
has Armagnac, in the region of Gascony, which has produced its own wine
distillate even longer than Cognac has. Distillers in other countries who use
nearly identical processes must call their products "brandy," although the
word, which comes from the Dutch for "burnt wine," is today applied to many
other kinds of spirits as well. Even vodka, I learned on a recent trip to
Stockholm, where I visited the excellent museum run by Vin&amp;Sprit, the
company that makes Absolut vodka, is still called "br&auml;nnvin"--"burnt
wine"--in Sweden, although its base was for a long time potatoes and wheat, and
today is just wheat. <p>

Obviously, something distilled from a fruit will taste unlike something
distilled from grain. The most important difference between a clear and a brown
liquor, though, is the aging in wood, which initially confers vanilla and
citrus flavors and later ones of tobacco and leather and earthy mushroom; if
the interior of the barrel has been charred, as is done in the making of
whiskey and bourbon, smoky flavors are also added. If grain-based eau de vie,
with its mild, bready flavors (as in Absolut vodka) or floral scents (as in
Polish Wyborowa vodka), were put into barrels and aged, it would become
whiskey. If the grape distillate called ue', made by the Nonino family in the
Friuli region of Italy, were put into barrels, it would with time become
cognac, although of course the Noninos couldn't call it that. <pre>

</pre>
<font size=5>T</font>HE reason people have become so devoted to
Germain-Robin's brandy is that it is made from many varieties of grapes, not the very few used in cognac. Grapes
in California are famously fruity by comparison with the same varieties grown
in Europe. They get more sun, and also they can be picked exactly when they're
ripe. Colder and damper European climates often lead cautious vintners to pick
early, to avoid molding and rot. As in the Champagne region, in Cognac white
grapes yield a thin, fairly uninteresting wine, and so growers long ago found
something more profitable to do with it. In both regions practicality was
codified into strict regulations. Makers of cognac-style brandy outside Cognac
can use wine made from any grapes they please, even red ones. Red grapes are
unusual in brandy, because the bitterness of the tannins in their skins can
become pronounced after long aging in oak; yet my favorite of the many brandies
I tried was made by Germain-Robin using only Pinot Noir.<p>
Unlike most producers of cognac-style brandy, Germain-Robin makes the majority
of its brandies from red wine; it also uses the white Ugni Blanc grape (better
known by its Italian name, Trebbiano), the base of today's cognacs. Hubert
Germain-Robin prefers the white Colombard--a grape that was the principal
component of cognac before phylloxera devastated European vineyards a hundred
years ago--and untraditional grapes like Chenin Blanc, Zinfandel, Petite Syrah,
S&eacute;millon, and Palomino. He has his fresh wine made by several vintners
in Mendocino County, who use the yeast and procedures he specifies. <p>
Germain-Robin, forty-four, is a tall, rangy, bearded man with a big peace
symbol tattooed on the back of his right hand. It isn't hard to picture him
hitchhiking along Highway 101, which is where Ansley Coale picked him and his
wife up fifteen years ago. Seeing that his passengers were tired, Coale offered
them lodging at the sheep farm he and his wife had bought as a ticket out of
academe. Born on the East Coast, Coale had taught classics at Berkeley, grown
tired of it, and bought 2,000 steep and barely accessible acres in Mendocino
for the price of a house in San Francisco. As for Germain-Robin, there was no
place for him in what had been his family's cognac business after a big company
bought it, but he was interested in Coale's suggestion that he try to distill
local wines. <p>
Germain-Robin went home to Cognac to look for an old copper still, which he
bought for $1,000 and had restored. The shape of Germain-Robin's still makes it
an "alambic," a word taken from the Arabs, who originated the process. It is
splendid, with an onion dome and a long serpentine "swan's neck" pipe leading
from the boiler to the barrel-shaped "pot." (A "pot" or "batch" still works one
load at a time, whereas a "column" still, which big brandy makers use, operates
continuously.) The neck is particularly long to help lengthen the
rectification, a process in which harsh flavors, which have a high specific
gravity, rise, condense, and are heated again, after which they recondense in
lighter, smoother form.<p>
Yet more beautiful than the still is the small one-room wooden cabin that
serves as distillery. The still is mounted in red brick against one wall, with
a big old hammered-copper pail set under the spigot. The window behind
Germain-Robin's desk overlooks the parched Mendocino hills of Coale's sheep
farm; along its sill old bottles that Coale collected and half-filled with
water in various jewel tones shine in the clear Mendocino light, casting
colored shadows against the neat rows of sample brandy bottles on wooden
shelves.<p>
Working with only one assistant, Germain-Robin distills day and night for about
four months. All the wine is distilled twice: once to produce a rough alcohol,
and then again with more care, in order to smooth the flavor and remove
impurities, or "congeners"--but not remove all of them, because that would
render the spirit tasteless. During both distillations only the "heart," or
middle portion, of what comes out of the still is used. Germain-Robin uses his
decorative copper pail to remove the "heads," which are too high in alcohol,
and the "tails," which are too harsh to drink. As is standard practice, the
heads and tails are redistilled in later batches.<p>
The heart, a clear eau de vie, flows from the pot's spigot straight into new
French oak barrels, which will be placed on racks in a wooden barn nearby. The
new wood gives vanilla flavors and many tannins to the brandy, and also starts
to color the liquid. After a year Germain-Robin transfers the brandy to
seasoned old barrels from Cognac, which continue to mature the liquid but add
no more tannins. Up to this point he has strictly separated barrels by grape
variety and vineyard. Now he starts to blend.<pre>

</pre>
 <font size=5>A</font>NY brandy house prides itself on its	blender, who
 usually assembles dozens and sometimes hundreds of brandies to form a house style. Producers
boast of the extent and age of their stocks. Each of the four biggest names in
cognac--Hennessy, Remy Martin, Martell, and Courvoisier--say that they put
cognac that is a hundred years old or even older into some of their blends. The
higher the average age of the blend, the more it costs, not because older
cognacs (or whiskeys or wines, for that matter) invariably taste better but
because tied-up storage space is expensive. The advantages of wood aging are
not, in any event, infinite. Cognacs more than sixty-five years old are taken
out of wood and retired into glass demijohns, to prevent further evaporation
and stop the aging process.<p>

Hennessy, like Martell and the smaller, highly regarded Hine, was begun by a
Briton who emigrated to France in the eighteenth century. Maurice Hennessy, the
great-grandson of the Irish founder, devised the designation "XO," which joins
"VS" and "VSOP" to make up the obscure and not very logical lexicon of cognac
classifications. "VS" means "very special"; the youngest of the three, the
cognac is required by French regulation to be blended from cognacs whose
minimum age is two and a half years. "VSOP" means "very superior old pale," and
the cognacs in its blend must have a minimum age of four and a half years. (The
English heritage and English market explain why the letters stand for English
words.) The cognacs in "XO"--the designation is thought to mean "extra old" but
perhaps means "extraordinary," or even "100" (the Roman numeral X plus a zero),
for the hundredth anniversary of Hennessy--must have a minimum age of six and a
half years and are usually even older. These designations carry no legal
requirements outside Cognac, but almost every maker of cognac-style brandy has
adopted them as a (rough) standard.<p>

More important than age is style. Although VS is the youngest, VSOP has the
lightest feel and usually tastes freshest, with citrus notes and what are known
as forward flavors--they register in the front of the mouth, predominating over
woody and other flavors that register in the back. VS is strongly and sometimes
harshly woody, with the vanilla and spice flavors that are apparent in young
wood. These flavors are far subtler and better developed in XO, which has the
power and mouth-coating viscosity that people expect in a cognac, and the
tobacco and leather flavors that come with age. As Patrick Morley-Fletcher, a
direct descendant of the original Hennessy, whose family still runs the
company, told me when we sampled his cognacs in New York, XO makes people think
of a comfortable armchair, a book, and a dog curled up by the fire. It's for
people who spiritually or literally dress in smoking jackets. <p>
VSOP is a good beginning cognac, because it is not overpowering and has what
Morley-Fletcher calls a "dainty femininity" (the English are less cautious in
matters of political correctness). VS usually has little to recommend it in the
way of inducing contemplation, and is often used in mixed drinks. Martell calls
its Cordon Bleu its most characteristic cognac, because of the high proportion
of grapes from Borderies, one of Cognac's four main growing areas, which have
the aroma of violets. Gabriel &amp; Andreu, a small distiller, has just put on
the market artisan-made cognacs from each of the four areas, for those who want
to learn the fine distinctions.<p>

Although the great majority of cognac sold is VS or VSOP, all the houses offer
blends that are yet older and more distinctive than XOs. Armagnacs are close to
the XO style; they are said to be woodier and sometimes harsher than cognac but
with superior aromatics, because the grapes that go into them have more flavor.
Older blends and Armagnacs were the brandies Coale had me try against his XO.
His had all the silky mouthfeel, power, and persistence of any XO or older
brandy, but a surprising sweetness, too, from the fruit flavor that
characterizes all his brandies. Also, the XO had life that continued on the
palate and as the brandy opened up in the glass. Other XOs have plain power,
and become duller as they stand. <p>

If I were getting a gift for a cognac lover, I would buy a bottle of
<A HREF="http://www.virtualvin.com/vvdata/620118982/wineries/grobin/winery.html">Germain-Robin XO</A>, which at $100 is expensive, but less so than the cognacs that
to my mind compared favorably to or bettered it: Hine's Triomphe ($180) and
Delamain's Tr&egrave;s V&eacute;n&eacute;rable ($175, if you can find
it--Delamain is the cognac of choice among most connoisseurs). If I wanted a
good all-purpose brandy to serve as cognac without worrying about how much
money was going down guests' throats, I would get the plain Germain-Robin Fine
($32.00), which has the freshness of a VSOP and strong fruit, too, and more
complexity than VSOP or VS usually has. I also like Hennessy's VSOP, which
costs $29.99.<p>

Another worthwhile gift is the right glass. It isn't a snifter--one of those
balloon-shaped things as appropriately sized as a restaurant pepper mill. The
wide base encourages too-fast evaporation of the alcohol, and the narrow top
concentrates the fumes, delivering heat to the nose and palate at the expense
of the subtler scents and flavors that should prevail. Professional tasters use
smaller, narrow glasses with only slightly bulbous bases and flared rims. When
I rented glasses recently for a cognac evening, the only reasonable alternative
was a small champagne flute. Carneros Alambic, another California producer of
cognac-style brandies, markets chimney-shaped tasting glasses that capture and
deliver aromas slowly; they do not have flared rims, and they cost $7.50 with
the company's logo and $10.00 without (the number is 707-253-9055). <p>
Riedel, an Austrian maker of glasses for wines and liquors, working in
consultation with the chief taster for Hennessy, has designed glasses for young
cognacs, which it calls VSOP, and for older ones, which it calls XO. The
outwardly curved rim makes the liquor first hit the front of the palate, which
registers sweetness, and then the back, where depth and roundness are felt.
Like everything from Riedel, the VSOP and XO glasses are delicate, expensive
($49.50 a crack, to use the wrong word), and uniquely suited to the beverages
for which they were made. <p>
Perhaps you will disapprove of a cognac-loving friend's treatment of glasses I
gave him last Christmas: following what he says is standard practice among
brandy connoisseurs, he simply wipes them after they are used, to keep them
seasoned. His wife certainly doesn't like it. However unappetizing, this has
its own logic. Many wine drinkers do no more than rinse their glasses, because
detergent residue spoils the taste of wine and liquor. With glasses this
expensive, not fumbling with a sponge or crowding them into a dishwasher rack
will at least lower the breakage rate.<pre>

</pre>
<font size=5>A</font>NSLEY Coale has come up with a clever marketing ploy:
one Germain-Robin blend is named Cigar, and the bottle bears a
nineteenth-century-style label with an engraving of a man smoking on a London
omnibus. Cigar smoking has become a craze among the smoking-jacket types Coale
wishes to reach, and of course cigars and brandy have always been
mates--although not very happy ones. Cigars so fill and scrape the mouth that
strong, acid flavors are required to counteract them and refresh the palate,
which is why VSOP has always made a better match with cigars than a deeper,
more expensive brandy. In the Cigar blend Germain-Robin pairs a forward,
citrusy Sauvignon Blanc brandy with older, deeper brandies, creating a kind of
one-two punch. Absent the tobacco, the sequential sensations are strange and
unbalanced, but I can certainly see how they could successfully do battle with
a good cigar.<p>
The brandy I liked best at the tasting is by no means classic,
but it reminded me of the surprise that made me so esteem the Noninos' ue'
after I had tried many grappas--which, however expertly made, always strike me
as harsh. Germain-Robin's V43 (the number of the barrel in which it was aged),
released this year, is made only of Pinot Noir wine that was distilled in 1986,
and it is expensive ($125). The flavor of the grape leaps out--a complete,
balanced fruit flavor from just one variety. And it has the distinct but not
burning fire that every good brandy has. Anyone who wants to experience the
full power and pleasure possible in a brandy should taste Germain-Robin's V43.
It shows why distillers who don't live in Cognac don't have to lose anything by
calling their liquor something else. <p>

<blockquote>


	<font size=5>C</font>OUNTING only those earthquakes that register a magnitude of 2.0 or greater on
the Richter scale, there are more than two quakes a day, on average, in the
lower forty-eight states. Although it takes a quake of 5.5 or greater to cause
significant damage to buildings, a 2.0 quake will still give a rude jolt to
people within a few miles of its epicenter.<p>

The states along the Pacific coast, of course, have the highest concentration
of quakes, because the fault lines that run through this region constitute a
boundary between two giant tectonic plates: the North American plate and the
Pacific plate. Four of the five largest quakes during the twenty-year period
covered by this map were in California or off its coast.<p>

But seismic activity is also common in places far away from this plate
boundary. A prominent band of earthquakes extends northward from Nevada to
Montana, in a zone between deformed rocks and stable rocks which has been
active periodically for the past 600 million years. Another band of earthquake
activity extends westward from Yellowstone National Park. The cause of these
earthquakes, and of the unusual volcanic activity at Yellowstone, is the
presence of a "hot spot"--a pipe of molten rock that blasts its way up to the
surface. (Pressure from this molten rock was so intense from 1923 to 1984 that
it gradually raised the park's elevation by three feet.) <p>

Earthquakes that occur east of the Rocky Mountains are probably associated with
ancient geological structures formed as a result of past plate-tectonic
activity. For example, 600 million years ago North America attempted to split
apart into two continents along the present location of the Mississippi River,
and as a result the crust is cut by thousands of ancient faults. A prominent
zone of activity near the border between Missouri and Tennessee produced three
of the most violent earthquakes on record, in 1811 and 1812. New England, which
is characterized by persistent but scattered quakes, has experienced at least
two quakes of 6.0 or greater since the early 1800s. Although most
earthquake-related attention focuses on the West Coast, it is entirely possible
that the country's next major quake may strike somewhere in the East.<p>

Is any part of the country safe from earthquakes? Judging by data from the past
three centuries, the safest places are eastern Texas and Florida.

<font size=5>I</font>T is a melancholy fact that poets seldom sustain their 
creative vigor and prowess into great old age.  The reasons for this are 
both self-evidently actuarial and curiously inscrutable.  By the time <A 
HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/whitman/walt.htm">Walt Whitman</A> came to be 
hailed as the "good gray poet," complete with photogenic Old Testament 
beard, he was virtually a poet emeritus, occupying himself with writing 
"annexes" for <A 
HREF="http://www.cc.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/whitman/index.html"><I>Leaves 
of Grass </I></A> under the doleful rubrics "Sands at Seventy" and "Goodbye 
My Fancy." <A 
HREF="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/wordsworth/">William 
Wordsworth</A>, the longest-lived of his storied generation of English 
Romantics, appraised the dire effects of the aging process on those in his 
line of work in a couplet that has since come to have a proverbial ring: 
"We Poets in our youth begin in gladness; / But thereof come in the end 
despondency and madness."<P>

<A HREF="kunindex.htm"><img 
src="../../../images/shorsera.gif" align=left vspace=10 hspace=10 border=0 
alt="(Related Articles)"></A>

That sounds gloomy beyond the call of duty.  Still, it succinctly lays out 
one plausible hypothesis for the high incidence of burnout among poets of a 
certain age.  Ample supporting evidence for the Wordsworthian position can 
be had by thumbing the anthologies that make a clerical fetish of listing 
dates of composition: the numbers suggest that a bitter dotage is more 
often than not a self-imposed sentence, the fateful consequence of 
extravagant ambition or of a prematurely autumnal disposition.  Throw in 
the scourges of obscurity, the blandishments of reputation, and the 
capriciousness of taste, common occupational hazards all, and it can seem a 
wonder that any poet would go to heroic measures to ward off 
disillusionment.  Just as telling, perhaps, are the concessions one finds 
even a grand old lion like <A 
HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/yeats/bogan.htm">William Butler Yeats</A> 
making to diminishing returns and dimming powers.  "Now that my ladder's 
gone," Yeats signed off famously in one of his last poems, "The Circus 
Animals' Desertion," "I must lie down where all the ladders start / In the 
foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart." <P>

Despondency and madness?  Rags and bones?  Is that all that a poet has to 
look forward to at the end of the day?  Ironically, it is Yeats himself who 
may be readily adduced by those who cherish hopes for a more sanguine 
outcome.  When <A 
HREF="http://www.usl.edu/Departments/English/authors/eliot/">T.  S.  
Eliot</A> delivered the first annual Yeats Lecture at <A 
HREF="http://www.adnet.ie/abbey/theatre.html">Dublin's Abbey Theatre</A>, 
shortly after the Irish poet's death, he made a special point of lauding 
the drive and stamina that Yeats mustered in producing some of his most 
vital work in his seventh and eighth decades.  As against the greater share 
of poets, whose "writing becomes an insincere mimicry of their earlier 
work" or who "leave their passion behind, and write only from the head, 
with a hollow and wasted virtuosity," the older Yeats, Eliot declared, 
stands as "a great and permanent example--which poets-to-come should study 
with reverence."<P>

Nor is Yeats the only one.  <A 
HREF="http://pages.ripco.com:8080/%7Emws/hardy.html">Thomas Hardy</A>, <A 
HREF="http://www.uchile.cl/WWW/nerudaing.html">Pablo Neruda</A>, <A 
HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/dykki/poetry/milosz/milcov.html">Czeslaw 
Milosz</A>, Robert Penn Warren, and William 
Carlos Williams all leap to mind as elder poets whose late or last work 
elicits unqualified esteem, leaving one to conclude, all things considered, 
that maybe the ranks are not so very sparse after all.  And then there is 
the great and permanent example of Stanley Kunitz, who not 
only has continued to write poems of a startling richness at an advanced 
age but has arguably saved his best for last.  Remarkable enough that a 
poet would publish a collection at ninety, as Kunitz did last fall, and yet 
it's a measure of the man that bowing to his eminence would amount to an 
impertinence.  What <I>Passing Through</I> confirms, beyond the faintest 
suggestion of charity, is that the venerable doyen of American poetry is 
still a poet in his prime.  <P> <BR>

<font size=5>T</font>HE century--the American Century, as Henry Luce would 
later coronate it--was new when Stanley Kunitz was born, and in most 
respects it had yet truly to begin.  Kunitz's home town of Worcester, 
Massachusetts, an industrial Sparta located some forty miles west of 
Boston's self-proclaimed Athens, had been a regular stop on the New England 
lyceum circuit in the second half of the nineteenth century, and for a 
precocious child of Kunitz's generation there must have been plenty of 
lingering ghosts in the air: illustrious Transcendentalists such as <A 
HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/nov1857/waldo.htm">Emerson</A> and <A 
HREF="http://miso.wwa.com/~jej/1thorea.html">Thoreau</A>, eminent Victorians 
such as <A HREF="http://hum.ucsc.edu/dickens/index.html">Charles 
Dickens</A> and <A 
HREF="http://library.utoronto.ca/www/utel/rp/authors/arnold.html">Matthew 
Arnold</A>, the abolitionist hero <A 
HREF="../../../atlweb/flashbks/Black/Douglas.htm">Frederick Douglass</A>, 
all of whom had barnstormed through town and brought out the throngs.<P>

By the time Kunitz was a schoolboy, of course, the genies of the modern age 
were out of the bottle.  The late <A HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/longfel/HWLindex.htm">Henry Wadsworth 
Longfellow,</A> he of the spreading chestnut tree and the forest primeval, 
may still have been cherished in the sitting rooms of Worcester, but his 
days as a pillar of national letters were clearly numbered.  Ezra Pound and 
his cohort would see to that, and they were already turning out poems and 
broadsides that spoke of accelerated expectations and manifest destinies 
every bit as forcefully as did Teddy Roosevelt's flashing 
spectacles and gleaming incisors.<P>

If artistic temperament could be reduced to the handy coordinates of time 
and place, then Kunitz by all rights should have made his name as a poet 
bent on making things new, in sync with a nation that was just then 
beginning to stretch its limbs as a political power and to wrench its 
literary culture once and for all free of Europe's.  As it happened, this 
offspring of immigrants from Lithuania's Jewish shtetls went on to become a 
stubbornly American poet of singular intuitions and convictions, one 
determined to write, as he would reflect decades later, in a lyric vein 
that would thrust him into "the thick of life .  .  .  caught in the 
dangerous traffic between self and universe." In vivid contrast to the two 
other notable American poets who were born in Worcester, though a few years 
later, Kunitz found his true pitch not in scrupulous reserve and ironic 
distance (Elizabeth Bishop), not in boisterous epic sweep 
and nativist sentiment (Charles Olson), but in pensive, 
prayerful utterance.  Neither radical nor reactionary, answering to no 
mandarin aesthetic or modernist insurrection, Kunitz's poetry has kept its 
own lonely counsels, austere of bearing and constrained in form, yet 
uninhibited in its depth of human sympathy and tragic feeling.  What has 
emerged from this monkish discipline is poetry rooted in the American 
meditative vernacular and at the same time reaching back to an Old World 
oracular tradition of incantation and lamentation--that, and an unnerving 
strain of astringent grandeur that is entirely Kunitz's own.  <P>

For a writer whose working life spans thirteen Presidents and perhaps as 
many literary zeitgeists, Kunitz's steadfastness is all the more 
extraordinary. No poet of stature has proved less quixotic or less 
profligate, and it's hard to think of many who have paced themselves so 
well. Few have been as resistant to the long poem and the epic conception, 
those bogeys that have devoured so many American poets, and perhaps only 
the famously fastidious Bishop showed any greater immunity to fever dreams 
of productivity. It would be a mistake, however, to equate this reticence 
with diffidence. What Kunitz's work lacks in glamour and commotion it 
compensates for in serious and decisive purpose. That no shelf will ever 
groan under Kunitz's collected poetry is a measure of his daunting 
ambition as well as of his scrupulous restraint.<P>

"Poets are always revisiting the state of their innocence, as if to be 
renewed by it," Kunitz has written, yet that sounds more wishful than true 
of his own star-crossed upbringing. His childhood household was a 
conspicuously matriarchal one, his father having taken his own life six 
weeks before the son's birth, and his mother remaining unbending in her 
edict that her husband's name not be uttered in her presence ("She locked 
his name / in her deepest cabinet / and would not let him out, / though I 
could hear him thumping," Kunitz writes in "The Portrait"). Raised largely 
by nursemaids, free to roam the wooded countryside and haunt the public 
library and the art museum, he turned that independence to good advantage 
and went on to a stellar career at Harvard, from which he graduated summa 
cum laude in 1926.<P>

At Harvard, Kunitz was recognized as a promising scholar and a precocious 
poet, but when his hopes for a faculty position at the college were dashed 
by the administration's veiled but inescapable intimation that his Jewish 
ancestry would make any such appointment impossible, he bitterly renounced 
academic life.  The years of peripatetic and hard-pressed living that 
followed (as a reporter in Worcester, an editor in New York, and later, 
during the Depression, a small farmer in Connecticut and Pennsylvania) did 
not, however, stifle his private writing life, and in 1930 he published his 
first volume of poetry, <I>Intellectual Things</I>.  The poems were dense, 
fiercely wrought, intricately figured--and for their day rather beyond the 
pale.  They gave the impression of owing more to the metaphysicals than to 
the moderns and of being nourished on a Yeatsian diet of eroticized 
mysticism.  Formally accomplished, they were nonetheless humming with a 
cathartic energy that set them apart from the dominant strains of American 
lyric poetry: the shrewd vernacular mode of <A 
HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/frost/frostint.htm">Robert Frost</A>, the 
cool, allusive vein of Eliot, and the linguistic legerdemain of <A 
HREF="http://www.english.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/stevens-poems.html">Wallace 
Stevens</A>.<P>

The poems in <I>Intellectual Things</I> and in Kunitz's similarly pitched 
subsequent volume <I>Passport to the War</I> (1944) were not calculated to 
suit the taste of the literary establishment.  Still, their intensity did 
catch the notice of his peers, particularly those at odds with the lofty 
postures of the high moderns.  His younger contemporary Theodore Roethke, 
who was in the midst of his own revolt against the emotionally distanced 
verse then in favor, was an early ally and for a time the reclusive 
Kunitz's only link to the active guild of letters.  Reading these early 
pieces now (a healthy selection can be found in <I>The Poems of Stanley 
Kunitz</I> <I>1928&#173;1978</I>), one can't help being struck by their 
extremity of feeling, which seems both to hark back to the harnessed 
passion of English poets such as George Herbert and <A 
HREF="http://library.utoronto.ca/www/utel/rp/authors/donne.html">John 
Donne</A> and to anticipate the jangled idiom of exposed nerves that poets 
like <A 
HREF="http://rowan.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/HRC/FindingAides/Lowell.Bio.html">Robert 
Lowell</A> and <A 
HREF="http://www.metronet.lib.mn.us/lol/umn-ber1.htm">John Berryman</A> 
would popularize a generation later.  Even so, these qualities were 
liabilities in a period that still looked to such polished cosmopolitans as 
Eliot and <A 
HREF="http://british.books@american.prices.com/books/1250/1272midi.html">W.  
H.  Auden</A> for its gold standard in poetry.  By his early fifties Kunitz 
seemed destined at best to remain that poor forked thing, a poet's poet.<P>

All that changed with a thunderclap in 1958, with the publication of 
Kunitz's <I>Selected Poems 1928&#173;1958</I>, which assembled a powerful 
group of some thirty new poems alongside many from his two previous 
collections.  The book was awarded the 1959 Pulitzer Prize in poetry, and 
assured Kunitz an acclaim that now seems less overdue than necessarily 
long-ripening.  Virtually from that moment on he has been not only one of 
the most widely admired figures in contemporary poetry but also, rarer 
still, a true ambassador of his art: a revered teacher for many years at 
Columbia University, a judicious consultant to the <A 
HREF="http://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</A>, a judge for the Yale 
Series of Younger Poets, and an august presence behind such institutions as 
the <A HREF="http://www.tmn.com/Artswire/poets/page.html">Academy of 
American Poets</A>, the <A 
HREF="http://www.tiac.net/users/ptown/fawc.html">Fine Arts Work Center</A> 
in Provincetown, and Poets House, a literary center and 
poetry library in New York.  Most extraordinary of all, the Kunitz of the 
past forty years has been a measurably finer poet than he was in the first 
half of his life, amassing a body of such starkly powerful lyric poems as 
to make all that came before them seem an extended apprenticeship.  They 
are, in all their outward simplicity and inward mystery, perhaps the 
closest that American poetry has come in our time to achieving an urgency 
and aura that deserve--even demand--to be called visionary.<P> <BR>

<font size=5>I</font>T is a metamorphosis that has invited deeper wonder with each successive  
collection of Kunitz's poems, and never so irresistibly as with <I>Passing 
Through</I>, released in November to coincide with the poet's ninetieth 
birthday and promptly garlanded with the National Book Award. Here, in a 
trim volume that nobody could wish shorter, is virtually the entire 
windfall of Kunitz's "later" poetry: the selected contents of <I>The 
Testing-Tree </I>(1971), "The Layers" (the constellation of new poems that 
led off his 1979 edition of <I>The Poems of Stanley Kunitz</I>), and 
<I>Next-to-Last Things: New Poems and Essays</I> (1985), along with nine 
poems appearing for the first time in a book. Not a lifetime's work but 
something more seasoned and concentrated and surpassing--work with a 
lifetime steeped in it. In contrast to <I>The Poems of Stanley Kunitz</I>, 
a more substantial compilation that showed Kunitz over a span of some 
fifty years moving beyond his clenched and seething early style, 
<I>Passing Through</I> allows readers to follow the clean arc of Kunitz's 
late three decades of composition in splendid isolation. <P>

It is, above all, a book of revelations. From the beginning Kunitz's was a 
poetry consecrated to transfiguring moments of insight and rapture, and it 
is startling to discover how active that core of exaltation has remained. 
For Kunitz, as for no other first-rank American poet of his time who comes 
readily to mind, the lyric poem has been a portal into mystical 
apprehension, an article of faith that he does not shrink from making 
explicit in the preface to <I>Passing Through</I>, "Instead of a 
Foreword." Conceding nothing to postmodern anxiety and exhaustion, Kunitz 
uses his prologue to extol the poet's vocation, as "a form of spiritual 
testimony," and poetry as "ultimately mythology, the telling of the 
stories of the soul." Most contemporary poets will squirm before this 
unreconstructed Keatsian language, preferring to tender their claims in 
the clipped lingua franca of professional shoptalk, but Kunitz will have 
none of that. "If we want to know what it felt like to be alive at any 
given moment in the long odyssey of the race," he avows, "it is to poetry 
we must turn."<P>

Taken alone, such dictums might sound faintly schoolmarmish. And they 
would seem to be the very sort of didactic propositions that could all too 
easily fog a poet's wits. But in Kunitz's case quite the opposite effect 
has come to pass: hewing to the old high road of Romantic soul-making has 
steeled and steadied him, made him infinitely lighter on his feet. His 
"later" poetry does not break with the elevated designs of his earlier 
work; it's a purified, fire-tempered variant of it, and all the more 
uncompromising for being more colloquially accessible, more sparse and 
parsed, more transparent in its drift and import. The younger Kunitz often 
wound line and image and allusion so tightly that his stanzas seemed to be 
fighting for oxygen, their wrought-up prosody grimly mirroring the 
contortions of a poet groping after blinding illuminations. The older 
Kunitz has not relaxed his grip, but no longer does he strain after 
effects. Listen, for example, to this fragment: "If in my sleep / The ape, 
the serpent, and the fox I find / Shut with my soul in fortune's writhing 
sack, / I tame them with the sections of my mind / And teach my mind to 
love its thoughtless crack." And now to this: "The word I spoke in anger / 
weighs less than a parsley seed, / but a road runs through it / that leads 
to my grave." <P>

The roughly half a century that stands between the first fragment, from 
"Beyond Reason," and the second, from <A 
HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/antholog/kunitz/quarrel.htm">"The 
Quarrel,"</A> scarcely seems an adequate index of the developmental 
light-years that divide them.  Kunitz is by no stretch the only poet of 
consequence to undertake a revolution from within at mid-career, but not 
many have done so with anywhere near the same force of conviction.  As if 
determining to stalk the numinous with finer snares and stealthier 
measures, Kunitz has taken pains to unpack his syntax, to hone a compact 
two- or three-beat line, to shape his poems with idiomatic economy and 
modesty.  Still, no technical appraisal can quite take account of all 
Kunitz had to cast aside and shear away to find his way to flaying cadences 
such as these: "In a murderous time / the heart breaks and breaks / and 
lives by breaking.  / It is necessary to go / through dark and deeper dark 
/ and not to turn." <P>

This passage belongs to the closing sequence of "The Testing-Tree," the 
title poem of the 1971 collection that unveiled the spare, lean manner of 
Kunitz's later years.  Here are the acoustics and poetics--simple 
indicative speech tending toward the condition of scripture and parable, a 
tenor at once rhapsodic and intimate, a terse strain of 
self-reckoning--Kunitz has hammered into his own unmistakable register of 
sound and sense.  Let <I>Passing Through </I> fall open at random and you 
cannot but marvel at this poet's sureness of touch and tempo: like the 
dragonfly he describes in "The Catch," a Kunitz poem, one often feels, 
might best be thought of as a "delicate engine / fired by impulse and 
glitter, / .  .  .  less image than thought, and the thought come alive.  
"And it's precisely that immediacy that gives this poetry its visionary 
authenticity: no matter how far he ranges into the realm of the unconscious 
or how deeply he dwells on signs and portents, there is nothing ethereal 
about Kunitz's habits of mind.  Even at their most surreal and allegorical 
(as in <A HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/antholog/kunitz/river.htm">"King of 
the River,"</A> which sends its totem salmon hurtling toward "the threshold 
/ of the last mystery / at the brute absolute hour," or "The Knot," where 
the poet fixates on a lintel's "Obstinate bud / sticky with life / mad for 
the rain again") Kunitz's poems seem grounded and exacting in a way that 
lyrics designed to orchestrate shuddering epiphanies seldom are.  Time and 
again they take--in a phrase out of Keats's letters which Kunitz has 
acknowledged as one of his touchstones--"but three steps from feathers to 
iron." On occasion, as in "An Old Cracked Tune," they move with the 
harrowing lilt of a song out of Blake:<P>

<font size=5>E</font>VEN for poets nowhere near Kunitz's age, a volume of 
selected poems is usually, in one studied way or another, the formal 
unveiling of a monument, a hopeful brief for literary posterity.  But no 
such ceremony intrudes on <I>Passing Through</I>: even in its closing 
pages, where the latest of these later poems appear, Kunitz doesn't once 
seem to be posing for a marble bust or auditioning for the anthologies.  
Instead one enters the presence of an indomitable elder spirit writing with 
alertness, tenacity, and finesse, still immersed in the life of the senses 
and persisting in the search for fugitive essences.  Neither resigned nor 
becalmed, Kunitz's newest poems are by turns contemplative, confiding, 
mythic, and elegiac.  If they have the measured and worldly tone that 
befits an old master, they also have the ardent and questing air of one 
whose capacity for artless wonder seems inexhaustible.  "What makes the 
engine go?" Kunitz asks in <A 
HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/antholog/kunitz/touchme.htm">"Touch Me,"</A> 
as he kneels in his cricket-riddled garden and marvels "like a child again 
/ .  .  .  to hear so clear / and brave a music pour / from such a small 
machine." And the answering line speaks for the persistence of Kunitz's 
music as well: "Desire, desire, desire."<P>

Perhaps the ultimate tribute to this book is 
to say that one closes it with no certainty that it's going to stand as the 
poet's last word.  Little in these poems puts one in mind of postscripts or 
epitaphs, and even Kunitz's most pronounced valedictory gestures seem 
somehow to steal a march on the gloaming.  Consider, for example, the 
closing lines of the book's title poem, which, its epigraph informs us, was 
composed on the poet's seventy-ninth birthday.  <P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



It should be noted that "Passing Through" is addressed to 
Kunitz's wife, Elise Asher; this is no last will and testament but a love 
poem.  The whole effect is vintage Kunitz: lines unforced and seemingly 
spontaneous yet so ineffable that one can almost imagine them having been 
inscribed on papyrus.  To write this calmly and collectedly, with a sanity 
so finely tempered that it acquires a spooky prescience, one has to have 
done more than simply endure.  And such is clearly the story behind the 
exemplary resilience of grand old man Stanley Kunitz: the fullness of time 
hasn't just left his senses intact but has concentrated his mind 
wonderfully.  That dust has moved mountains.<p>

	<font size=5>T</font>HE New York gallery world experienced a mini-watershed last fall, when the Grace Borgenicht Gallery shut its doors after nearly half a

century. Borgenicht appeared on the scene in 1951, showing American

avant-gardists such as Ilya Bolotowsky, Milton Avery, and Jimmy Ernst. By the

time she retired, at eighty, they had become established figures, and her

gallery had come to typify the sort of soberly run, familial blue-chip shop to

which many serious artists aspire. Borgenicht's final show was a display of

complex, jewel-toned still lifes by the painter Janet Fish. At its opening the

dealer presided one last time a white-haired, dignified, formidable presence

seated sternly behind the counter, as if guarding the vegetables and dip. A

huge crowd milled about the gallery, and more than one person said morosely,

"This is the end of an era."<p>



The recent art-market collapse hit New York hard, causing a wave of closures

and bankruptcies, and the gallery world that has since emerged has dismayed

many by teetering between two extremes: a few glossy mega-dealers who have the

muscle to move the market their way, and a rash of smaller, scruffier

galleries that often struggle to stay afloat. Yet even through the darkest days

new dealers and spaces have continued to appear. When Borgenicht opened,

probably only a handful of the city's dealers promoted that era's contemporary

art, let alone the American variety. Today, according to Steve Anzovin, who

edits <i>Art in America</i>'s annual guide to galleries, a New York dealer of

contemporary art must vie for attention with 365 others-- about 15 percent more

than in 1990, the pre-recession peak.<p>



Despite the renewed activity, what characterizes the present moment is a sense

of frustration with the gallery itself. In Borgenicht's early days the

contemporary lookspare, white-walled, and bare-floored, more like an artist's

loft than a bourgeois living room--was freshly minted. Betty Parsons, the

legendary dealer who championed Robert Rauschenberg and 

<a href="http://found.cs.nyu.edu/fox/art/pollock/">Jackson Pollock</a>, had

opened New York's first such gallery in 1946. Thirty years later the critic

Brian O'Doherty, in a famous series of essays titled <i>Inside the White

Cube</i>, decoded the aesthetic and market assumptions that underlie the

presumed neutrality of such a space. Today many of New York's chicest shows,

most of which are conceptual, seem intent on hammering home the idea that we

are all participating in a big clich&eacute;. The artist fills the exhibition

space with furniture from the back room, where deals are traditionally made,

thus putting the business end of things on display. Or it is somehow made clear

that the gallery itself has become a framing device and we are the

installation. It has actually become a clich&eacute; to invoke the

clich&eacute;--a nice display of Postmodernist tail-chasing.

Perhaps that's why, as the art world moves more surely into the mood and

aesthetic that will come to define the nineties, the motif that keeps cropping

up dates from a time before Borgenicht's--the era of the salon.<p>

 

<font size=5>I</font>N the annals of art the word "salon" has a slippery range of meanings and

associations. One thinks first of the French Salon, the juried expositions put

on by the Acad&aacute;mie every year or so from 1667 on, which later became one

of the first ways for the public to see new art. In the late nineteenth century

the Paris Salons arose as an alternative to this official display. These huge

gatherings, often with thousands of works and tens of thousands of viewers,

became important venues for <a href="http://www.oir.ucf.edu/wm/paint/glo/

impressionism/">Impressionism</a>, the avant-garde that eventually

forced the academy out of favor. Although the original Salon still resonates in

the imagination the way Emile Zola famously described it--an "absolute

cacophony"--"salon" has become another way of saying "group show."<p>



Whereas the public salon has often helped to advance the avant-garde, the

private salon seems to spring up in someone's home whenever it needs nurturing.

The salon of Gertrude and Leo Stein in turn-of-the-century

Paris, where the "modern" community gathered to hash over <a href="

http://www.clubinternet.com/picasso/homepage.html">Picasso</a> and 

<a href="http://www.oberlin.edu/~hfrank/matisse/styles.html">Matisse</a>,

is the prime example. In New York, as European modernism was filtering into

this country at the time of the First World War, most creative movements got

their start in someone's living room. At Mabel Dodge's "Evenings" artists

exchanged ideas with many of the city's flashiest political and intellectual

figures. The collectors Walter and Louise Arensberg provided late-night

hospitality for Francis Picabia and 

<a href="http://gurukul.ucc.american.edu/dshep/modern_students/sg3322a/

home.html">Marcel Duchamp</a>, the reigning deities of New York Dada.<p>



For "absolute cacophony" today, visit an art fair, where hundreds of dealers

gather under one roof to hawk their wares to collectors and one another. This

kind of clubby, convivial event is becoming such an important part of the

international art market that the trade magazine <i>Art &amp; Auction

</i>recently termed art fairs a "mania." One reason is simple economics--the

need to get maximum bang for each buck spent in overhead. Another is that for

an art market whose rapid growth has required increasing professionalization,

it's fun to get back to those old horse-trading roots. <p>



A recent variation is the art fair in a hotel, which manages to be both public

and private. Dealers, usually young and cutting-edge, take over a few floors

and install their wares in individual rooms. The Gramercy International, the

granddaddy of the bunch, was held in New York for the third time last May. As

usual, it proved a barometer of the trendiest art trends, and also a voyage in

miniature through salons of New York past. Last year the highlight was a room

decked out in tribute to Florine Stettheimer, whose campy, idiosyncratic

portraits, many based on her own family's Jazz Age salon, recently enjoyed a

vogue. This time it was a performance by Brigid Berlin, a former denizen of

Andy Warhol's Factory. One could also visit rooms hosted by the dealers Holly

Solomon and Gracie Mansion. Solomon, whose most notable artist is probably Nam

June Paik, the creator of video art, began by holding a salon in her home in

1969. Mansion helped to jump-start the East Village funk scene in 1982 by

holding a photography show in the toilet of her flat. <p>



Like art fairs, today's private salons are prompted in part by financial

exigency. Many dealers who closed galleries over the past few years have been

showing work in their homes. Ren&eacute;e Riccardo, for instance, shut down her

SoHo gallery, Arena, in 1993 and reopened it in her Brooklyn apartment. "The

people who actually survive," she told me once when I stopped by, "are the ones

who are doing their business creatively." Arena is in a quiet street of turn-

of-the-century brownstones. The interior walls are ivory instead of white, the ceiling is

decked with Victorian trim, and the dining room holds some handsome Eames and

Breuer chairs. Art must compete for attention with radiators, a bed, the

toilet, and a dog basket--not to mention the basket's frequently yapping

occupant.<p>



Not long ago the parlor held a sculpture of a miniature log cabin--a comment of

some sort on masculine identity from Jason Middlebrook, a recent art-school

graduate. Another time Rachel Harrison had fitted out the room like a bomb

shelter, complete with randomly placed cans of peas. (She spent ages telling me

what it all meant.)<p>



Even if much of the gallery's art aims for spunky irreverence, its weekly

openings are earnest. Billed as salons, they are held on Sunday afternoons;

apple juice, wine, and cookies are served. Visitors are said to spend hours

there, until Riccardo kicks them out. "People are responding to it," she says,

"because they're looking for some comfort and sharing."<p>



Another obvious pleasure offered by a salon-style space is the sense of being

in on a privileged and bohemian experience. I've found this, paradoxically, at

galleries that are less domestic for example, the enormous NoHo loft where the

veteran dealer Barbara Braathen mounts an occasional show. Braathen closed her

storefront gallery in 1989 and, like many, chose to go "underground," selling

privately. One has to know about her small openings to find them; the

traditional gallery opening is pretty much accessible to anyone who spots it

from the street. "In our age," Braathen told me recently, "the gallery-as-a-store

concept is kind of running out of energy, because it costs so much to run and

because people don't have time to go to stores. What we see now is more of

bringing the art back into the home and having parties."<p>



Though Braathen doesn't call her openings salons, her shows often summon up an

alluringly taboo aesthetic. Last fall a one-week show featured small oil

paintings by Sally Randall that appropriated details from David and Ingres, who

were staples of the vanquished French Acad&eacute;mie. Another show displayed

work by fifty artists and was hung "salon-style":

in places it ranged the entire length and breadth of the wall, after the

fashion of the nineteenth century. The show was focused on the theme of beauty,

a loaded subject that has lately enjoyed a resurgence. Both events were

celebrated with long, late, crowded openings. At one, two men became so

inebriated that they toppled to the floor.<p>



<font size=5>O</font>UTSIDE the art world bohemianism, or at least a semblance of it, has probably

never looked so mainstream. It's popular these days to assume that the arts are

becoming marginalized. But over the past few years, since The Gap first put the

performance poet Max Blagg in a TV ad, the coffeehouse-bookstore has gone

mass-market, and gallery and museum sites seem to go up almost daily on the

Internet.<p>



In New York several upmarket hotels have recently opened book and music salons,

and a big draw on the society circuit is the frequent evening art openings at

Stubbs Books &amp; Prints, an interior-decorating concern. At the last Gramercy

fair, I was invited to two "art parties," one of them run by a fellow who said

he was "temporarily" in advertising; and my soap-opera-actor neighbor tells me

that many of his friends are starting theater and comedy salons. Recently even

fashion designers have elected to present their new collections in salonlike

settings. In such a climate staging an art event seems an entirely natural

career move for a young entrepreneur. <p>



Three years ago Gina Fiore, then twenty-five, moved into a minuscule Greenwich

Village studio in which the painter Jackson Pollock had briefly lived. It

struck her as a perfect place to show art; she later expanded her plans to

include a wine-tasting and cooking-class business. The Gina Fiore Salon has

been held five or six times over the past year, presenting art displays and

poetry readings. Every time I visit, the work--usually small abstract works on

paper--seems from afar to be serious and strong. But it is hard to get a good

look, because the place is always jammed with people. Fiore told me once that

she is sometimes surprised by the turnout. "People feel intimidated going into

Gagosian and Pace-Wildenstein," she said, citing the city's two most prominent

mega-dealers. (She was once an intern at Pace.) "It's a different way of seeing

work, and people find that really refreshing."<p>



A similar explanation seems to lie behind the growing interest in Jill

Brienza's salons, held at the Hotel Roger Smith. Though the hotel, in midtown

Manhattan, is well off the beaten gallery track, one of the owners, James

Knowles, who took it over in 1989, has worked to establish it as an artists'

hangout since. Brienza began working there two and a half years ago, when she

was twenty, after a brief stint as the curator of nightclub art shows. Today

she supplements a regular gallery program with occasional readings, art and

music events, and a series of frequent and free dinners that she calls

"advertising in a very exclusive, nice way." (A recent evening celebrated

"Bright," a show of fresh, exciting abstract work by young unknowns.)<p>



The events are held in a penthouse apartment furnished much as it was in the

1940s, when the hotel's founder lived there, with family portraits, potted

plants, and a Steinway grand. Admission is by invitation, and even if one does

see the occasional art star or celebrity in the crowd, the atmosphere remains

familial. Most nights Brienza's parents come in from Brooklyn; sometimes

someone plays the piano; and the hostess makes constant introductions. (It

probably doesn't hurt that Brienza looks like a junior Morticia Addams and is

always wearing some vampy dress made by her mother, a former fashion designer.)

The attitude of exclusivity combined with inclusiveness seems a particularly

twentysomething stance. <p>



Back in conventional gallery territory, the salon is making inroads even on the

white cube itself. Over the past year I've noticed more galleries experimenting

with such elements as poetry readings, music-filled openings, decorative

interiors, and extended evening hours, the better to attract new clients and

enthusiasts. One SoHo space, the three-year-old

Tricia Collins * Grand Salon, is organized entirely around the salon ethos. It

is owned by Tricia Collins, who, as part of the team Collins &amp; Milazzo, was

one of the more respected curator-critics to emerge from the 1980s East Village

conceptual-art scene. The pair held weekly artists' soir&eacute;es, organized

shows that pinpointed coming trends, and wrote artspeak-filled

manifestos to explicate them. Many of the unknowns they championed early, such

as Jeff Koons and Ross Bleckner, became art stars.<p>



"It's not that I don't appreciate rhetoric and theory," Collins told me

recently. "I just think it's time for a more straightforward or poetic

approach." Grand Salon is her bid to encourage "a more public form of the kind

of conversations that took place in my living room," and thereby to

"reintroduce meaning." It works in a way that seems to be half commercial

space, half conceptual project. In the middle of the main room a couch and two

armchairs are grouped around a coffee table. "To me, the furniture functions

literally and symbolically in order to promote dialogue," Collins said when I

came in. <i>Oh, sure</i>, I thought. But then I realized what an unusual

experience it is to sit talking with a dealer in the middle of a gallery, in

full view of anyone who happens to pass by--artist, collector, or potential

competitor--or even to plunk down on the couch for a while and look at the art by

oneself. <p>



From time to time Collins hosts an evening art film, talk, or reading, and she

says that these occasions are what Grand Salon is all about. I find, though,

that I've come to rely on the gallery not for its evenings but for regular

viewings of terrific painting--a medium that is often rumored to be going the

way of print journalism. Last fall I saw some wonderfully unpretentious fruit

and flower portraits, laden with sequins and glitter, by the artist Tabboo!,

who moonlights as a drag performer. Later Stefano Peroli and Charles Clough

presented a relatively austere double bill of brilliantly hued abstractions.

Another offering was unabashedly spiritual--joyful oil paintings of saints and

supplicants, collaged with shells, jewelry, and broken bits of mirror, by Mary

L. Proctor, a North Florida junkyard dealer who began making art last year,

when the Lord advised her to. "There has to be space for contemplation,"

Collins told me one afternoon as we sat on her couch. Oddly enough, that seems

a sentiment with which Grace Borgenicht, sitting coolly behind her gallery

counter, might very well have agreed.<p>

	<font size=5>I</font>n 1611, Thomas Sutton, a gentleman of England, died, and left an estate to
charitable purposes, including the foundation of the famous Charterhouse. There
was some dispute as to the will, and Francis Bacon took occasion to address the
king a letter of advice respecting the proposed disposition of the property, as
in case the will was set aside the king would be heir. In that letter occurs a
passage which has a singular force here and now, where conditions exist not
unlike those indicated by Bacon. "Concerning the advancement of learning," he
writes, "I do subscribe to the opinion of one of the wisest and greatest men of
your kingdom: That for grammar schools there are already too many, and
therefore no providence to add where there is excess. For the great number of
schools which are in your Highness' realm doth cause a want, and doth cause
likewise an overflow, both of them inconvenient, and one of them dangerous. For
by means thereof they find want, in the country and towns, both of servants for
husbandry and apprentices for trade; and, on the other side, there being more
scholars bred than the state can prefer and employ, and the active part of that
life not bearing a proportion to the preparative, it must needs fall out that
many persons will be bred unfit for other vocations, and unprofitable for that
in which they are brought up; which fills the realm full of indigent, idle, and
wanton people, which are but materia rerum novarum."<p>

<p>

<p>

We are discovering something of the same want and overflow now, especially in
our cities. We need not even change Bacon's terms, though the words themselves
have a little different meaning. Now, as then, there are too many grammar
schools, or, what is more to the purpose, the grammar schools teach too much
grammar. Bacon complains that in his day the schools caused a want of farmers
and mechanics, and an overflow of clerkly people. Precisely this complaint must
be made at present. The tendency of our highly organized public-school system
is to discourage manual labor, and to multiply enormously the number of those
who seek to maintain themselves by the pen or by trade. The course of
instruction is almost exclusively intellectual in its scope, the time occupied
covers years when the training for mechanical pursuits naturally begins, and
the apparent prospect of a higher social pursuit leads to an aversion from the
humbler occupation. The result is that the mechanical arts suffer an indignity,
and boys who might have been fitted for good workmen become indifferent
book-keepers, clerks, and salesmen.<p>

<p>

<p>

Now a state rests for prosperity not upon its clerks, but upon its workmen; it
is the men who handle tools that contribute to its wealth and may be trusted
for its defense, and it is of the first importance that this class should be
trained not only in the arts, but in intelligence and character. But the
divorce of manual and mental education in our public schools tends to
perpetuate the separation out of school. If there is intelligence in the
workman and a capacity to improve his art, these are not the distinguished
results of the training which the public schools give; that training steadily
withdraws the young from mechanical and agricultural pursuits, and crowds them
into occupations already overstocked, which depend for their prosperity indeed
upon the development of the arts. When a time of depression or disorder comes,
great numbers are cast out of employment, with no resources of industry, and
the state becomes full of "indigent, idle, and wanton people."<p>

<p>

<p>

Moreover, the public-school system not being found favorable to the mechanic
arts, what great educational force remains? The apprentice system has nearly
disappeared. It has declined contemporaneously with the rise and encouragement
of a compulsory public-school system, and the two facts are related more
closely than by the accident of time. It is true that we must look for the
chief cause of this decline to the introduction of steam power, which has led
to the formation of associated industries, and the breaking up of labor into
fragments. The rapid changes in society also have made the old relation of
master and apprentice unlikely; but neither the introduction of machinery nor
the multiplication of grades between the contractor and the workman has
lessened the necessity for skilled labor, or rendered the trained workman a
superfluous member of a great state. On the contrary, since the natural forces
which conspire to sustain the arts have temporarily given way to a new
discovery, it becomes more necessary to organize in their defense; but the
chief organization upon which the state relies is found insufficient, if not
positively antagonistic.<p>

<p>

<p>

The economic consideration which would persuade us to introduce into the
public-school system a recognition of manual training are reenforced by the
discovery of a yet higher argument in the very nature of education itself. It
is not to be wondered at that our school system should have grown into a purely
intellectual order. In its beginning there was no assumption of an entire
control of the child. So much time was given school as could be spared from the
farm and shop. There still existed a well-recognized tradition of mechanical
knowledge, and the school was looked upon as supplying those rudiments which
could best be acquired there. Gradually, as cities grew, increasing thus the
class of children who had no other employment, school came to be the chief
occupation of the young. Then the discharge upon our shores of an illiterate
foreign population excited alarm lest ignorance should get in the majority, and
we made haste to compel the children of this class into the public schools. The
attention of the community becoming more concentrated on this important
institution of the state, the existing apparatus for instruction was improved
and refined: the school-book industry was developed, and normal school
established for the better education of teachers who were to stand behind these
school-books. The pride of the state, the enthusiasm of teachers, the natural
quickness of children at leisure, these have all helped to swell the tide of
the public-school system, and to carry it on in the direction of its first
setting. <p>

<p>

<p>

Now that all this has been done and the elementary truths of society begin to
assert themselves, we shall discover that in neglecting the education of the
hand we have not only weakened the power of the state, but have stimulated an
unbalanced education of the person. A training which ignores the hand is not
the training which either nature or history will approve. That member is
something more than a symbol of industry. "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,
do it with thy might," "Establish Thou the work of our hands," are not phrases
ingeniously contrived to translate into the vernacular the intellectual
exercises of clerks and commercial travelers; they point to an elemental
condition of human well-being. Nor is this training of the hand to be obtained
by means of gymnastic swinging of dumb-bells. The training of the hand means
the power to use a tool; the training of the eye is the power to see perfect
work; the training of the mind is the power to conceive and execute that
work.<p>

<p>

<p>

The curing of the defect in society and the restoration of education to a sound
and healthful condition are to be sought in a reformation of that system which
we justly regard as the very engine of the state's prosperity. Nor are signs
lacking that the public mind is turning in that direction. The introduction of
drawing into the curriculum is one sign, and it is curious to observe how the
double argument, drawn from economy and from the philosophy of education, has
been used in support of this measure. The introduction of sewing for girls is
even more significant. Here the argument has been drawn chiefly from the
economic side, and the facts which gave the argument its force were
unassailable; but no one who appreciates the full meaning of education can help
seeing how valuable an element was introduced into the education of girls in
Boson when sewing was made a regular part of public-school training.<p>

<p>

<p>

This study of sewing forces upon one the question of the manual education of
boys. The question is precisely the same, only its solution is more
complicated.  To the girl is given one tool, and the perfect mastery of that
carries with it a training in thoroughness, order, concentration, precision,
and self-respect; the practice, moreover, is easily associated with a daily
need, and the charm of useful production is attendant on the study. But there
is no one tool which can be affirmed of the boy, and this is sometimes taken as
an excuse for not teaching him the use of any. Yet the variety of tools which a
boy may use only suggests practical difficulties; it does not declare these
difficulties insurmountable, nor in any way weaken the force of the educational
argument. The difficulties indeed are such as yield readily to an intelligent
will. Half of the question is answered when one considers that the primary
object of manual education in the public schools is not to make boys
carpenters, ship-builders, masons, or followers of any other craft, but to
instruct them in the meaning of their hands and of the tools which those hands
may grasp. Hence the shops of instruction, not of construction, and the
training will be in the grammar of the arts, not in the indefinite number of
forms which the arts assume.<p>

<p>

<p>

The various schools of technology which exist do not meet the general need
which we have described. Their business is to train masters and professional
mechanics; they do not make mechanics any more than colleges make book-keepers.
A graduate of a college may find himself finally in the position of an ordinary
clerk, and never rise above it; and so a graduate of the technological school
may prove at last only a journeyman; but neither college nor school exists for
these ends. Nor can the want be supplied by benevolent or evening schools.
These are but make-shifts. They could become important only as they drew life
out of the public schools. No; the remedy lies in such a readjustment of the
public-school system in our cities as shall make it include formal, progressive
instruction in the manual arts. If it be said that the state or the city has no
function to educate children for specific trades, but only to give them a
common-school education, as that term is now understood, it can be answered,
first, that the present system does almost inevitably educate children for the
desk and the counter, with a reversion in many cases of the almshouse or the
police-station; and, second, that there is nothing in the present reach of
common-school education which need compel us to glorify it as the final and
perfect force for developing the human character. In truth, we might better ask
humbly why the present system has failed than boast of its success. Nor should
we be far wrong if we were to assert that in making common such an education as
we have outlined we are likely to produce citizens who in peace would be more
valuable, working in shops, and not waiting behind counters, and whose training
would make them better soldiers in war. The drill of school-boys with the saw,
the plane, the axe, and the file would make them stronger defenders of the
state than if they had known only the manual exercise of the school-room, or
even had been formed into battalions of miniature soldiers.

	<h4>
	
	THE POLITICS OF MEANING 
	
	</h4>
	<i>by Michael Lerner.</i><br><i>Addison-Wesley, 355 pages,
	<br>$24.00</i><br>
	
	<p>
	
	
	
	
	
	<font size=5>I</font>N the beginning there was a hunger for vision. And then came a great need for
rhetoric. Soon President and Mrs. Clinton sensed representative vibrations in
the quasi-mystical-socio-politico-psychological coat of crazy colors that the
author and activist Michael Lerner calls the <A HREF="http://www.panix.com/~tikkun/pom.html">"politics of meaning."</A> They must
have felt that Lerner, with his talk of a universal inner pain and "hunger" for
connection, might help them administer verbal balm to an America collectively
turning inward amid social and economic disruptions. So, shortly into their
reign, the Clintons summoned Lerner to Washington, thereby setting in motion
Lerner's own inward-turning fall.<p> 
Lerner had come sprawling onto the public scene in 1986 with his magazine
<A HREF="http://www.panix.com/~tikkun/index.html"><i>Tikkun </i></A>. A licensed psychotherapist, he had spent the previous ten years
in Oakland, California, treating patients at a clinic he co-founded called the
Institute for Labor and Mental Health. (Lerner has claimed that his vision for
America came to him through his encounters with patients.) But problems have
beset <i>Tikkun </i>from the start. A former leader of Students for a
Democratic Society and co-editor of the ultraleft magazine <i>Ramparts</i>,
Lerner seemed to long for the old confrontational days. He began to confront
himself. He began to march on his own magazine.<p>

At its best <i>Tikkun </i>has<i> </i>tried to speak with a nonpartisan voice of
common decency, outside the crumbling framework of left-right antitheses. But
for Lerner, all politics is cosmic. And in his own offerings in the magazine,
for page after page he has spluttered on like an old Volkswagen about "pain"
and "healing," "misrecognition" of our true selves and "healing," "surplus
powerlessness" and "healing," "healing" and . . . well, "healing." <p>

Increasingly Lerner's writings have been careering toward strange destinations:
A radical feminist perspective that called for strengthening the family. An
attack on selfishness that talked only about the self. An emphasis on "personal
responsibility" which proclaimed that every individual has been crippled by an
unfeeling world. A version of Judaism as a revolutionary religion which was to
historical Judaism what a macaroon is to a Passover seder. <p>
<br>
<font size=5>O</font>UT of the wilderness, then, where he had wandered through the sands of
psychotherapy for two decades after the New Left's self-destruction, Lerner
bounded hopefully toward 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. This faux-Hasidic
evangelical, this erstwhile Gramscian revolutionary, this former leader of SDS,
sat musing and advising in the White House: a scene almost too beautiful to be
true. For the first time since the 1960s a member of the New Left had a
President's ear, albeit by way of the commanding attention of the First Lady.
(And if Lerner had been a disciple of Talleyrand instead of Gramsci . . . ? The
irreverent mind boggles.) Most interesting, Lerner had not had to revise
himself rightward to pass into the halls of power. He had had only to dust off
a radical disdain for a liberal welfare state's concessions to the status quo.
Then he threw over this old scorn the cloak of a flourishing centrist
impatience with liberal policy.<p>
In a speech she made about health care in April of 1993, Hillary Clinton
dropped the phrase "politics of meaning." Meanwhile, Lerner in his magazine was
fawningly touting Clinton and his own association with the President, complete
with a reproduction of a memo that Clinton as governor of Arkansas had sent
Lerner, thanking him for "clarifying" some important issues. The press swarmed
all over Lerner. <i>The New York Times Magazine </i>ran a corrosive article
about him titled "This Year's Prophet" a month after running an article that
derided the warm reception Hillary Clinton had extended to some of Lerner's
zanier notions.<p>

As a focal point for ideas--universal health insurance, an emphasis on
rebuilding the institutions of civil society, a publicly responsible
journalism--<i>Tikkun</i> at its best never deserved the mostly shallow media
trouncing it got when the First Lady made Lerner's phrase famous. But its best
began to come less and less often. Lerner's grip on the magazine was reducing
it to inanity. And his publicity-hungry maneuverings earned him whatever
vituperation he received. <p>

But fatal for Lerner, the Clintons' instincts about his usefulness proved
monumentally wrong. The "politics of meaning" came down, in the practical
political sense, to changing the reigning cultural "paradigms." "Caring" and
"healing" meant sensitivity to the pain of every faint heart in every narrowing
form of group self-interest. Thus in a country where more and more people were
either losing their jobs or worried about losing their jobs, the question of
homosexuals in the military became paramount. And what began to seem like
feminism's devolution into a mission of further empowering upper-middle-class
women, carried forward in the symbolic presence of the First Lady, topped the
national agenda. <p>

In November of 1994 some pundits strained to understand why the beleaguered
working class and the anxious middle class voted for candidates who would only
preserve a beleaguering and anxiety-producing status quo. The reason is simple.
In contemporary America's whirling culture, promises of stability amount to
promises of change. And the meaning-oriented Clintons, partly inspired by
Lerner's loony visions of a brave new consciousness, promised only to hasten
the pace of flux.<p>
<br>
<font size=5>I</font>N the 1970s the New Left got into the consciousness-changing business in a big
way and made itself extinct. Courage, faith, hard work, and eventual
legislation, not a new cultural hegemony, had changed the lot of black people
in the South. Determined exposure of the truth, expressions of solidarity, and
appeals to American decency, not a transformation of the American mind, had
helped to end the war in Vietnam. But Lerner never really left the ruined
precincts of the theoretical left. He simply translated "bourgeois hegemony"
into "the pain" and the "misrecognition" of our true selves that he believes
deform all our lives. <p>
In <i>The Politics of Meaning</i>, Lerner writes, "There is no one who is not
<i>also </i>a victim, no one who has not been spiritually and emotionally
negated as a child." Such pain creates the "selfishness paradigm" that rules
our society. Healing this pain is "the condition for the fulfillment of our
needs for meaning," for "the consciousness necessary for building a very
different kind of society." And this consciousness is the "condition for the
liberation of our entire society from a materialist and individualist ethos."
There is not much difference between those belligerently vapid statements and
the vapidly belligerent declaration Lerner made twenty-three years ago, in
<i>The New Socialist Revolution: An Introduction to Its Theory and Strategy</i>
(a book that doesn't appear on his list of publications): "The first task of
the revolutionary movement . . . is to destroy bourgeois hegemony and develop a
radical consciousness among each of the potential constituencies for
revolutionary action."<p>

Brother, can you spare a paradigm? The cant term appears over and over in
Lerner's writings, and in this book. It is one of the contemporary left's most
precious conceptual amulets. (It has also been adapted by everyone from
advisers in the Bush White House to business strategists.) Thomas Kuhn
introduced the concept in his <i>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>
(1962), to explain how scientific knowledge proceeds by upheaval. The theories
of Copernicus, Newton, and Einstein, Kuhn wrote, are all self-contained and
discontinuous from one another. There is no steady accumulation of truth in the
form of objective knowledge about the physical universe. Instead each theory is
a "revolutionary" break from the previous theory, resulting in the arbitrary
replacement of one "paradigm" of knowledge by another. Once the paradigm of
knowledge in a given period changes, the way science is done and applied is
completely transformed. <p>

Having migrated to the universities, the New Left cadres seized on Kuhn's idea;
they turned Marx on his head. Marx had argued that material conditions create
consciousness; the new theoreticians would have none of it. They held that
rather than changing material conditions in order to change social attitudes,
it is necessary to engineer new social attitudes--new paradigms of social
knowledge--in order to transform material conditions. <p>

This left, however, so infatuated with the impersonal processes of hard
science, ignored a significant absence in Kuhn's book. Kuhn applied his idea of
paradigm upheavals to the physical sciences but not to the biological sciences.
Knowledge about the circulatory system, for example, from the Renaissance
through the nineteenth century to today, has been more cumulative than in the
physical sciences: there are abiding truths about the operation and treatment
of the human heart. <p>

So, typically, the theoretical left chose the wrong scientific analogy. If it
hadn't, it might have stressed--as the young Marx, along with social democrats
and liberals, did--the relationship between human dignity and the fulfillment
of material needs. For there is nothing so transforming as the certainty of a
prosperous human future growing out of decent employment and guarantees of
life's basic necessities. That is where Marx's early humanism meets life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Meaning and caring and empathy for the
Other often flow from those simple material premises--perhaps even a lifting of
the ban on gays in the military. Yet the contemporary left has steered
liberalism toward the inherently snobbish psychologization of materialism--let
them eat consciousness! --whose desiccated fruits are political correctness and
the "politics of meaning." It was in part such an abstract contempt for
ordinary experience that led the social-democratic thinker Michael Harrington
to walk out of the 1962 SDS summit at Port Huron in disgust. The same abstract
contempt has helped to disable American liberalism. Yet in <i>The Politics of
Meaning</i>, Lerner recommends that courses be given throughout public high
school in "the history of domination of consciousness." Lerner never 
learns. <p>
<br>

<font size=5>T</font>HE press attacked Lerner (and also gave him forum after forum), the Clintons
dropped him, and the press forgot him. Out of that humiliated sensibility comes
<i>The Politics of Meaning</i>.<p>
There is not much to say about this sad book, an unreadable compendium of
gaseous bromides that Lerner has been repeating for ten years. The overall
effect is of an oversized, appallingly written and conceived brochure for a
socio-politico-cosmic vacation. <p>
<br>

<blockquote>Instead of thinking of a politics-of-meaning society as one in which people are
going to be excessively focussed on wondering about their duty, we can picture
it as one in which people will be so excited to be meeting one other and having
the opportunity to spend time together that we will resemble playful puppies,
joyfully exploring and celebrating each other's existence.</blockquote><br>

<blockequote><blockquote>Another dignity-restoring mechanism would be to encourage residents of nursing
homes to hold memorial services for residents who have passed 
away.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>If [children] are emotionally or physically brutalized . . . we are all likely
to suffer the consequences--whether in random acts of violence or in ethically
insensitive voting behavior.</blockquote><p>

<blockquote>Indeed, we might eventually ask whether there really is such a thing as "the
physical world," or whether that concept itself is merely an attempt to
abstract reality from its essential spiritual, ethical, and material
interconnectedness.</blockquote> <p>

<blockquote>Men are often so alienated from their own bodies that many have no idea how much
more delicious and stimulating a meaning-based sexuality can 
be.</blockquote> <p>

As his public fortunes have fallen, Lerner has disappeared into his own ego. He
is doing the work of Onan, not Moses. <p>

<font size=5>G</font>IVEN his mental convolutions, it's impossible to resist applying Lerner's
cherished psychologizing to Lerner himself. An analysis would go like this. The
people Lerner "treated" at his Institute for Labor and Mental Health were
working-class and middle-class. That is, they were members of the "silent
majority" who had once rejected Lerner's calls for revolutionary action. So for
two decades Lerner got back his own. His patients might reasonably have thought
he was trying to help them; but Lerner had another agenda. He tells us that his
"aim was to better understand the psychodynamics of middle-income working
people, and also to try to understand why so many of them were moving to the
political Right." And the findings of his research with the people who put
themselves in his care were that they had been deformed by pain and
misrecognition, maimed by the "deprivation of meaning." In other words, it was
<i>their fault </i>that the revolution had failed and propelled Lerner into
twenty years of oblivion, not his. <i>They </i>had failed <i>him</i>. This
project of self-vindication has been at the "meaning" core of his ambitions
since before Lerner was seduced and then abandoned by the Clintons and lost the
media spotlight. Now, as an indifferent society once again rejects Lerner's
calls for transformation, the self-vindication remains.<p>

Let all this infuriated healing come to an end.

<blockquote>

	<font size=5>F</font>INALLY, after nearly ten years of getting in touch with their inner children

and recovering from abuse, millions of consumers of personal-development ideas

have found the perfect parents. Guardian angels watch over all of us,

<img src="Books.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

best-selling books about angels proclaim. Like Superman, they swoop down and

save us from sudden death--lifting us out of the way of oncoming cars or

catching us when we fall off cliffs. Like Mr. Chips, they nurture and inspire

us: "We were given an angel to help us in the creation and writing of this

book," Alma Daniel, Timothy Wyllie, and Andrew Ramer, the authors of <i>Ask

Your Angels</i>, confide, describing angels as the "social workers of the

universe." They give us unsolicited, unconditional love.<p>



Descending from heaven, or wherever, not bound by the mere material world,

angels also give us proof of immortality and the comforting belief that there

is no death, only some sort of energy transformation, which is confirmed by

other best-selling spirituality books. <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/

obidos/ISBN=044651862X/theatlanticmonthA/"><i>The Celestine Prophecy</i></a>, by

 <A HREF="http://www.bookwire.com/BookInfo.Author$55">James

Redfield</A>, assures us that what we imagine as death is a happy transition to a

higher spiritual plane: a new Eden awaits us in the next millennium. Books

about near-death experiences describe the brief sojourns in heaven of people

who died but were sent back to earth by God, or God's minions, to complete

their missions or simply to spread the word: there is no death. Books about

reincarnation promise us many lives before we achieve spiritual perfection and

ascend in the end to--whatever. For Americans who are depressed about the

future of this material world and anxious about violent crime, income

inequality, inadequate health care, war, global warming, or the decline of the

nuclear family, there is incredibly good news about the cosmos.<p>



Publishers of popular spirituality books have already died and gone to heaven.

<i>The Celestine Prophecy</i> recently passed its hundredth week on the <i>New

York Times</i> best-seller list. <i>Embraced by the Light</i>, Betty J. Eadie's

report on her near-death experience, held the No. 1 slot on the <i>New York

Times</i> list for more than thirty weeks. Sales of Sophy Burnham's <i>A</i>

<i>Book of Angels</i> have reached about 750,000. Angel books have sold

millions of copies, as have books about alien abductions. <i>Abduction</i>,

John E. Mack's 1994 account of his interviews with "abductees," and Whitley

Strieber's <i>Communion</i>, a firsthand account of abduction, have been

best-sellers as well. <p>



The abduction stories are not simple anodynes; aliens are a lot scarier and

more aggressive than angels. In some ways they are like the bad parents of

recovery books. Indeed, aliens engage in the worst form of abuse--sexual

molestation. (And abduction stories rely on the reader's belief in

"recovered-memory syndrome," popularized by the recovery movement.) But

extraterrestrial abuse often turns out to be a form of tough love, or at least

a necessity: the aliens are mating with us, creating a hybrid, higher life

form. Although tales of alien abduction generally begin in terror, they end in

enlightenment--the revelation that we are not alone in an indifferent universe.

Usually the aliens want to save us from an impending apocalypse. <p>



Like established religions, mass-market spirituality books often differ

ideologically--some tell us we only live once, while others preach

reincarnation--but they share a general belief in immortality and the presence

of extraterrestrial or celestial beings devoted to our welfare. They share as

well a general disdain for reason, enshrined by the therapeutic culture.

Drawing on popular psychology even more than on religion, experts on angels,

aliens, and life after death traffic in "feeling realities." <A HREF="http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/nova/aliens/johnmack.html">John Mack</A>, a

psychiatrist, writes that he took seriously an alien-abduction story if "what

was being reported was felt to be real by the experiencer . . . and

communicated sincerely" (as if sincerity in these cases might not be simply a

measure of the intensity of delusion). The truth lies in what you feel,

personal-development experts assert, not what you "know in your head," much

less what you can prove. People who have talked to their guardian angels, ET,

or God can only agree. <p>



Spirituality authors, who are generally forgiving of most human foibles (people

aren't bad, only good or less evolved), take a hard line on intellectualism.

Murder they can rationalize: murder victims are spirits who volunteered to be

"part of some other soul's enlightenment test," Marlo Morgan reports in

<i><A HREF="http://www.harpercollins.com/shelves/mutanh.htm">Mutant Message Down Under</A></i>, a best-selling story of spiritual encounters

with aborigines. Skepticism they view with contempt, as the refuge of the

unenlightened. <i>The Celestine Prophecy </i>workbook, a guide to using <i>The

Celestine Prophecy</i>, begins by reminding us that "those who take a strictly

intellectual approach to this subject will be the last to 'get it.'" To change

the world we must "break through the habits of skepticism and denial." <p>



Like virtually all books of its genre, <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i> can

confidently demand that readers suspend their disbelief because it tells so

many people precisely what they want to hear. Its message is that there is no

such thing as a coincidence; there are no chance encounters, no arbitrary

events, no reasons for existential angst. There is only cosmic synchronicity,

to which we become attuned as we evolve spiritually. (The assurance that events

are not random, that we live in a universe ordered by a benign supernatural

being, is repeated in many popular spirituality books.) We have, then, no

reason to worry about the future; it holds the promise of paradise. According

to <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i>, in the future humankind will evolve into a

spiritually enlightened culture of peace and harmony. <p>



In this new Eden critical thinking will be unnecessary. Truth will be

self-evident and accessible to all. People will simply "intuit" the answers to

global problems like pollution, and to individual problems as well. "Guided by

their intuitions, everyone will know precisely what to do and when to do it."

Who would choose the hard work of thinking over the serenity of knowledge bred

in the bone? <p>



So reason is reduced to a mere developmental stage for humankind. <i>The

Celestine Prophecy </i>provides a summary history of the past thousand years.

Born out of the secularization of human culture, science was useful in

providing us with a map of the material world; but it cannot help us to

understand the nonmaterial world of interpersonal energy or the spiritual

questions that confront us as we approach the millennium. As one of the

characters in the book explains, a "particular attitude known as scientific

skepticism . . . served us well with the more obvious phenomena in nature, with

objects such as rocks and bodies and trees, objects everyone can perceive no

matter how skeptical they are." But, she continues, thanks to Einstein we now

know that "the basic stuff of the universe" is "a kind of pure energy that is

malleable to human intention and expectation . . . our expectation itself

causes our energy to flow out into the world and affect other energy systems."

Most scientists simply can't take this notion seriously, she laments.<p>



You can hear in this denigration of science an attempt to appropriate its

credibility, which is typically New Age. (Angel books, for example, talk about

doing scientific research on the existence of angels.) Einstein is on the side

of <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i>, we're told. Most scientists are not

sufficiently evolved to carry on his work. After all, they would not take

seriously the assertion that in the future human beings will be raised "to

higher and higher vibrations." (There is much talk about vibrations in pop

spirituality books; highly evolved people usually vibrate more.) <i>The

Celestine Prophecy</i> reports that as we evolve, vibrating at higher levels,

we become invisible to the less evolved among us. As distilled spiritual

energy, we achieve virtual immortality.<p>



All these insights into the meaning of everything are delivered in what the

flap copy for <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i> calls "a parable filled with vital

truths"--a description bound to lead an unsophisticated reader to believe that

this book is fact, not fiction. It is, however, a dime-novel adventure story

about a man who goes on a quest in Peru to discover an ancient Mayan manuscript

containing the Nine Insights that will save humankind. The story is told in the

first person; the style is testimonial and borrows liberally from popular

notions of spirituality and personal development. <i>Mutant Message Down

Under</i> is equally coy about the veracity of the author's reported adventure

with aborigines: the flap copy labels the book fiction, but in her preface

Morgan claims that it was "inspired by actual experience." She writes, "It is

sold as a novel to protect the small tribe of Aborigines from legal

involvement." In other words, it's a docudrama, which some readers are apt to

consider literally true.<p>



For people who believe in angels, to be sure, believing in <i>The Celestine

Prophecy</i> isn't much of a leap--angel books tell similar truths. According

to <i>A</i> <i>Book of Angels</i> (which started a publishing trend), angels

and other supernatural beings are constantly intervening in our lives. Whatever

we consider coincidence is evidence of the divine. And we can facilitate divine

intervention through prayer: "It is the pleasure of the universe to give us

what we need." This means that mind and spirit are stronger than matter. We can

control events, making wishes and dreams come true. <i>The Celestine

Prophecy</i> makes a similar claim: "When you have acquired enough energy, you

are ready to consciously engage evolution . . . to produce the coincidences

that will lead you forward." Angel books, however, require a little less

initiative: you don't "consciously engage" evolution yourself; you simply ask

your angel.<p>

<br>



<font size=5>T</font>HE appeal of these books is clear. They promise 

us bliss--a world of no evil (only spiritual retardation),&nbsp;fear, loneliness, pain, or death. The

failure to deal with evil is striking. In near-death-experience accounts God,

or the "Being of Light" who greets us when we die, is nonjudgmental. Like a

wise but indulgent parent, He, She, or It smiles ruefully upon us when we

review our sins, knowing that we will do better next time. 

It's easy to sell good news like this, and the authors confidently rely on

classic fallacious arguments. They argue by declaration, which is what makes

the books so amusing. In matter-of-fact, authoritative tones, the authors tell

us how plants and human beings exchange energy--or they describe what angels

look like, whether or how they're sexed, how they communicate with human

beings, and how they differ from ghosts. Readers might be expected to wonder,

How do they know? <p>



What makes fantastic declarations believable is, in part, the vehemence with which

they're proffered. Again, in the world of spirituality as well as of pop

psychology, intensity of personal belief is evidence of truth. It is considered

very bad form--even abuse--to challenge the veracity of any personal testimony

that might be offered in a twelve-step group or on a talk show, unless the

testimony itself is equivocal. Once, I landed on a radio show with a woman who

claimed that she and her family had been abducted and sexually molested by

aliens. When I said that it might be difficult for some people to accept her

tale at face value, she angrily offered as evidence of her encounters bodily

markings, memories, and (in a stab at empiricism) "metallurgically flattened

shrubbery" outside her house. I told her that I was sorry for her trouble.

Sometimes I, too, feel as if I'm sleeping with an extraterrestrial.



Ubiquity of belief is also offered as evidence of truth. <i>Ask Your Angels</i>

asserts that the references to angels in popular culture--in songs such as

"Teen Angel" and "Johnny Angel," and in movies such as <i>It's a Wonderful

Life</i> and <i>Heaven Knows</i>,<i> Mr. Allison</i>--constitute evidence that

angels exist, as do the popularity of angel books and the willingness of the

industry to publish them. Whatever sells, whatever many people believe

strongly, must be true. There are, however, exceptions to this reliance on

feelings as evidence of truth: if, for instance, your feelings lead to

disbelief instead of belief, they're apt to be dismissed as some form of

denial. This is not a common problem. Usually intellectualism, not "feeling

reality," is blamed for disbelief. But, some angel experts suggest, there may

be emotional as well as intellectual barriers to belief: unwillingness to

believe in angels can reflect low self-esteem. <p>



These are perfectly closed belief systems; the possibility of error is never

considered. If you don't see angels, or energy fields emanating from your

rhododendron, you simply don't know how to look for them. The possibility that

some people who believe that they commune with angels or ghosts or enjoy

mystical out-of-body experiences may be hallucinating is given little credence.

Like detective stories, spirituality books usually discard the most plausible

explanations and adopt the most implausible ones for the mysteries they

encounter. Rational, alternative explanations for a belief don't, after all,

assume the truth of whatever is believed.<p>



All these styles of argument--arguing by declaration, arguing from intensity

and ubiquity of belief, and arguing from a conclusion--are routinely employed

by personal-development experts, including codependency gurus and a range of

inspirational and motivational speakers. So it is easy for readers to switch

from one belief system to another--to turn from codependency books to books

about angels. <p>



In fact, authors and publishers expect that many of these books will share an

audience, and they offer similar solace. They present solutions to both global

and individual problems: focusing on personal spiritual evolution and the

evolution of humankind, they're not above giving advice about how to get a

better job. Norman Vincent Peale's best seller <i>The Power of Positive

Thinking</i> has the same preoccupation with the metaphysical and the trivial:

it will cure existential anxiety and improve one's golf game. Virtually all

personal-development and spirituality books partake of the positive-thinking

tradition, which pre-dated Peale by at least a hundred years. They also

cross-reference one another. <i>Ask Your Angels</i>, for example, includes a

twelve-step angel program. <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i> talks about

codependency, and <i>The Celestine Prophecy </i>workbook cites the best-selling

alternative-medicine guru Deepak Chopra. <p>



These books offer membership in a spiritual elite. Indeed, the authors tend to

see themselves as messiahs, chosen by aliens, angels, or various "Beings of

Light" to help save the world. (People who claim to have been abducted by

aliens often observe that they have always felt "special" and now know that

their alienation was literal.) But a spiritual encounter isn't necessary to

join the elite; merely reading these books and being open to their messages is

cited as a means to enlightenment. <p>



Belief systems like this demand very little of us. A good attitude substitutes

for good works. Self-absorption may be a spiritual imperative.

Nineteenth-century revivalists, late-twentieth-century recovery-movement

experts, and an expert on spirituality like James Redfield tell us that by

working on our own religious, psychological, or spiritual evolution, we are

working on the world. "Your own willingness to take time to study <i>The

Celestine Prophecy</i> is part of the evolutionary process," Redfield writes.

"<i>The amount of consciousness you bring to the collective mind is part of

your contribution</i>." <p>



Activity is not required; in this world there is no such thing as a sin of

omission. Popular spirituality books involve even less self-help than popular

psychology, with its exaltation of experts; instead of working through the

twelve steps or any other technique, you can now wait for angelic intervention.

But what is perhaps even more troubling than the childlike passivity encouraged

by these books is their denigration of skepticism and their encouragement of

habits of unreason, which carry over into political and work and home life. The

elevation of personal truths and personal testimony over logic and verifiable

fact which links popular psychology and popular spirituality today also infects

other kinds of belief.<p>



Consider the militia movement, which invests the New World Order with demonic

power. Propaganda of the extreme right (like propaganda of the extreme left

twenty-five years ago) employs the same techniques of argument found in popular

spirituality books. Propagandists argue by declaration, relying on intensity

and relative ubiquity of belief. (Genuinely ubiquitous beliefs, however, lose

the power of cultism: if the participation of some people in the belief system

provides a reality test and a source of solidarity, the participation of many

people makes the system less special.) <p>



There are also clear analogies between the denial of coincidence that's central

to popular spirituality literature and the embrace of conspiracy theories. If

angel books reflect the need to believe in omnipotent, absolute good, extremist

political groups reflect the need to believe in omnipotent evil--in the form of

the U.S. government or the New World Order. There are virtually no political

accidents in the view of a conspiracy theorist; whatever happens happens for a

reason, generally the worst. <p>



It's not surprising, then, to find crossovers from New Age beliefs to the

militias. I know a convert to the militia movement who was once deeply enmeshed

in the Church of Scientology and remains an avid believer in the paranormal.

She has always thrived on the presence of enemies, and so, in a way, do popular

spirituality authors. Even if there is no evil in the benevolent universe they

depict, only unenlightenment, there are still enemies: notably science,

rationalism, and established religion, which is almost always distinguished

from spirituality as doctrine rather than feeling. (In <i>The Celestine

Prophecy</i> the primary villains are not scientists but priests.) Despite

their majoritarian appeal, mass-market spirituality books offer the pleasures

of membership in a besieged minority. Like extremist political movements, they

shine with moral vanity.

The price of imported pasta is likely to rise this month, as the 
 U.S. Commerce
Department designates and enacts final tariffs on Italian and Turkish pasta.
The action comes in response to complaints from domestic manufacturers, who
allege that much of the dry pasta imported from Italy and Turkey is subsidized
by the governments of those countries and "dumped," or sold below cost, in the
United States. The foreign share of the market for pasta has been rising in
recent years: in 1994 Italian and Turkish imports accounted for 13 percent of
the pasta sold in the United States, up from 9 percent two years before. Some
domestic manufacturers have found that the cost of their raw materials alone
exceeds the price of the cheapest imported pasta.

Conventional ideas about African art will come under scrutiny this month, as
New York's <a href="http://math240.lehman.cuny.edu/gugg/">Guggenheim 
Museum</a> hosts the first exhibition ever to survey the art
of all of Africa. <i>Africa: The Art of a Continent </i>will run from June
<b>7</b> to September 29. It will consist of more than 500 items, including
sculpture, murals, ceramics, jewelry, and textiles, organized into seven
geographically based sections. The exhibit originated last year at the Royal
<img src="Arts.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>
Academy of Arts, in London, where it was hailed as a watershed in the Western
treatment of African art but also prompted debate about whether objects
designed by African craftsmen for practical use should be considered art or
simply handicraft. Curators at the Guggenheim expect that the exhibit will
spark discussion about wider issues of African culture and identity; it will be
accompanied by showings of African photographs and films at the museum and by
citywide symposia on the continent's art, history, and culture.

Telephone companies had withheld the service from California while lobbying the

Federal Communications Commission to reduce privacy protections demanded by the
state's Public Utilities Commission. Their efforts met with some success: as in
all other states, unlisted numbers will be protected from display only if
customers file a request or dial a blocking code before each call. Nearly half
of all residential telephone numbers in California--the highest proportion in
the country--are unlisted.

June <b>1</b>, the largest private organization ever aimed at reducing smoking
among children opens its doors today in Washington, D.C. The National Center
for Tobacco-Free Kids will serve as an umbrella for more than 90 groups that
seek to curb smoking among juveniles. Among other things, it will work for
passage of rules recently proposed by the <a href= "http://www.fda.gov/">
Food and Drug Administration</a> to
<img src="Health.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>
sharply restrict the marketing and sale of tobacco products to the young. The
FDA rules would require retailers to verify that cigarette buyers are at least
18 years old; limit sales to face-to-face contact (eliminating vending
machines, for example); ban outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of schools
and playgrounds; restrict the outdoor advertising that remains to black and
white, text only; and prohibit the distribution by tobacco companies of
promotional items such as caps and T-shirts. Every day some 3,000 children
start smoking; it is estimated that a third of them will eventually die of
tobacco-related illnesses.

	<h4>Q&amp;A</h4>
	
<i>Why does it hurt when aluminum foil touches a filling?</i><p>

<img src="Q&A.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>
Whenever two different metals are separated by a conducting liquid--such as
saliva--voltage is created. Because a filling is grounded in a tooth, the
current flows into the tooth, stimulating the nerve. The more dissimilar the
metals in terms of electrical activity, the more pronounced the effect: those
with gold fillings will feel more pain in this situation than those with
silver-based fillings, because silver is closer to aluminum than gold is. If
the mouth were completely dry, there would be no conducting liquid, and this
painful reaction would not occur. The phenomenon of an electrical current
stimulating a nerve was first demonstrated (though not fully understood) by the
eighteenth-century physician Luigi Galvani, who made frogs twitch by using
brass hooks to connect them to an iron railing.

<a href="http://www.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~russell/brhome.htm">Bertrand 
Russell</a>, writing in the June, 1921, issue of <i>The Atlantic
Monthly</i>: "The aesthetic indictment of industrialism is perhaps the least
serious. A much more serious feature is the way in which it forces men, women,
and children to live a life against instinct, unnatural, unspontaneous,
artificial. Where industry is thoroughly developed, men are deprived of the
sight of green fields and the smell of earth after rain; they are cooped
together in irksome proximity, surrounded by noise and dirt, compelled to spend
<img src="75years.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>
many hours a day performing some utterly uninteresting and monotonous
mechanical task. Women are, for the most part, obliged to work in factories,
and to leave to others the care of their children. The children themselves, if
they are preserved from work in the factories, are kept at work in school, with
an intensity that is especially damaging to the best brains. The result of this
life against instinct is that industrial populations tend to be listless and
trivial, in constant search of excitement, delighted by a murder, and still
more delighted by a war."

<blockquote>

	<i><font size=4>Since the intoxicating days of the

forties and fifties when new casinos were going up every six months, Nevada has

been undergoing changes that will transform it from a gambling principality to

a modern welfare state. Edward F. Sherman is a Texas attorney who witnessed the

process as a legal aide to Governor Grant Sawyer.</i></font><p>

	</pre>

	

	<font size=5>J</font>ust a generation ago Nevada was known to Americans chiefly as the state with

the smallest population, the hardest to remember capital city (Carson City),

and the largest deposits of valuable mineral ore in the union. But all that

changed. Nevada legalized gambling in 1931, Reno became the "quickie divorce"

capital of the country, and in 1946, gangster "Bugsey" Siegel opened the

Flamingo, the first of the great luxurious casinos on the Las Vegas Strip.

Nevada was suddenly plunged into the Casino Era. Almost overnight the entire

state--its economy, its government, its values, and its traditions--was

reshaped to meet the needs of the new order.<p>



<p>



Today, twenty years later, the Strip is glittering and active, Las Vegas'

Fremont Street is garish and crowded, and the steady clink of slot machines is

heard all night along Reno's neon-studded main drag. But beneath this exterior

there is something different, something changed from the heady days of the late

1940s and 1950s, when a new casino was going up every six months. In Nevada's

banks and business houses, in the new subdivisions of Las Vegas and Reno, in

the city halls, and most of all, in Carson City, there is suddenly an awareness

that the Casino Era is drawing to a close.<p>



<p>



Change has been slow in coming to Nevada because it was so totally committed to

the Casino Era. When Nevadans realized after World War II that gambling had

exceeded their wildest dreams of bringing tourists and dollars into the state,

all resistance to the gambling establishment ceased. Impressed by the seemingly

endless flow of silver dollars, they convinced themselves that they lived in a

never-never land where gambling taxes could support the state without the need

for income, estate, gift, or corporation taxes. The truth was that gambling

taxes did not produce enough revenue, and that only Nevada's failure to provide

even the basic social services permitted such low taxation.<p>



<p>



Although many Nevadans still like to think of their state as a unique gambling

principality like Monaco, the fact is that it is a vast, diverse area of

110,000 square miles, the seventh largest state in the union, with a population

that is exploding at a rate of more than 5000 a month (Nevada's 1950 population

of 160,000 almost doubled by 1960, tripled by 1965, and will quintuple by

1970). As more and more people come streaming into the state, the need for

social services--for schools, universities, urban planning, water, welfare

programs, and regulation of vested interests--becomes acute. But the unbalanced

state economy, in which gambling still provides a quarter of the tax revenues

and generates half of the economic activity, does not furnish a viable base

from which to finance social services. Nevada is faced with the strong need to

attract new industry in order to diversify its economic structure.<p>



<p>



The failure of Nevadans to face up to facts about their state's economy was

encouraged by a succession of weak governors whose passive laissez-faire

administrations seemed content to let the gambling establishment have a free

hand and to wallow in the imagined profits it created. The first break in this

pattern occurred in 1958 when Grant Sawyer, a forty-year-old district attorney

from Elko, Nevada, running his first statewide race, was elected governor. In

eight years, Sawyer has succeeded in demonstrating that Nevada is badly in need

of an activist governor not merely a glorified caretaker for the gambling

interests.<p>



<p>



Like many another good politician, Sawyer is a product of his region. He was

born in Twin Falls, Idaho, but his father, a doctor, moved to Fallon, Nevada,

near Reno, when he was a teen-ager. He graduated from the University of Nevada

in 1941, served as an army lieutenant in the war, and after the war joined

other young Nevadans with political inclinations by taking a patronage job with

Senator Pat McCarran in Washington and studying law at Georgetown University.

The job with McCarran made him one of the "McCarran people," an essential

classification in those days for success in Nevada politics.<p>



<p>



Outsiders find it difficult to grasp the importance of Senator Pat McCarran in

Nevada politics. First elected to the Senate in 1932, in time he became

chairman of three powerful Senate committees, the Senate Judiciary Committee,

to which 40 percent of all Senate bills had to be referred, the Appropriations

Subcommittee, and the Subcommittee on Foreign Aid. Thus, the senator from the

least populous state in the union had one of the largest staffs in the Senate

and controlled jobs in dozens of federal agencies.<p>



<p>



When money began to flow into Nevada after 1946 to build the great casinos,

McCarran quickly established himself with the new gambling interests. He had

always had a healthy respect for power and influence, and Nevada's new gambling

magnates, many of them hoodlums from international syndicates, displayed raw

power which made even McCarran look like an amateur. A compromise was worked

out, with the gambling interests supporting the McCarran machine, and McCarran,

in turn, providing political and governmental backing for anything the gambling

establishment desired. McCarran liked Nevada small, and so did the casino

owners. As McCarran's closest adviser, Reno millionaire Norman Blitz, expressed

it, "Nevada must be kept small. Let industry go elsewhere. Large payrolls bring

in large families which cost more money in taxes for public services." When

McCarran died suddenly in 1954, there was no heir to his machine.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



This was the situation when Grant Sawyer took over as party chairman in 1955.

Recognizing the vacuum in the party, a group of young Democratic activists

determined that the governor in Carson City could provide more effective

leadership than a senator 3000 miles away. With Sawyer as the candidate, they

set their sights on the 1958 governor's race.<p>



<p>



Sawyer made an appealing candidate: he was boyish-looking, with wavy brown

hair, dark-rimmed glasses, a self-confident manner, an engaging smile, a deep

resonant voice, and a quick and active mind. In a campaign in which the issues

played second fiddle to personalities, Sawyer defeated the popular but

ineffective incumbent Republican governor Charles Russell. But the badly

apportioned rural Senate remained Republican, and the Assembly was only

narrowly Democratic.<p>



<p>



Sawyer had not been elected as a reformer. He liked the fast life of Vegas, the

luxury of the plush casinos, and the excitement of the Strip night life (a

reporter's picture of him doing the twist in 1962 with a casino owner's wife

made the front pages of papers around the country long before Bill Moyers'

celebrated Watusi). He wore expensive clothes and was known as a big tipper,

although he has never been more than a "nickel in the slot machine" kind of

gambler.<p>



<p>



But he had an idealistic side. He had a curiosity about things, which made him

open to new ideas and remarkably free of bias and predisposition (he recently

spent an afternoon questioning the members of a Zen Buddhist sect which had

established a monastery in the ghost town of Virginia City, and later made good

his promise to visit them). As Sawyer grew into the governorship, he became

more and more aware of the limited opportunities and stunted public services

available to Nevadans under the status quo.<p>



<p>



The first Sawyer administration set a new breeze blowing through Carson City.

His attractive wife was a popular hostess in the governor's mansion. His

appointees, younger, better educated, and more imaginative, replaced some of

the rural political plug horses who had always staffed the state government.

Sawyer's first-term legislative programs were cautious and limited, but one

important accomplishment was his "hang tough" gambling control bill. This was

Nevada's first gambling regulation with teeth in it, and oddly enough it

aroused little opposition from the gambling industry. By 1959, Nevada gambling

was so badly tarnished that even the casino interests recognized that some type

of reform was needed to restore public confidence. The Kefauver hearings of the

early 1950s uncovered a vast network of hoodlum control of Nevada gambling, and

the growing number of gangland murders and atrocities were impossible to

hide.<p>



<p>



Sawyer's "hang tough" gambling control bill created a state Gambling Control

Board with investigative and enforcement units. In administering the bill,

Sawyer appointed tough, highly qualified ex-FBI and law-enforcement officials

to the new agency. For the first time the state possessed the ability to

enforce the gambling laws and deny gambling licenses to undesirables.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



By the end of his first term, Sawyer had proved himself to be a capable and

popular administrator, but aside from the gambling bill, he had not pressed for

major reform. His landslide re-election in 1962 gave him the mandate he needed

to strike out in new directions. On the top of his list of concerns was

reorganization of the state government, which had become encumbered over the

years by a confusion of agencies, boards, and commissions, many of which the

governor had no power to control. The ninety-nine-year-old governmental

structure, unchanged since statehood and the advent of modern government, badly

needed overhauling.<p>



<p>



Another of Sawyer's second-term objectives was to break the power of an

important rival in the state capital, the legislative counsel. In a number of

small Western states, legislative counsels have been established over the years

to provide research and drafting assistance to the legislators. Nevada's

legislative counsel, an amiable and pedantic ex-Assembly clerk named Jeff

Springmeyer, appointed in 1946, had gradually increased his powers and

authority, enlarged his staff, and made himself indispensable to legislators

and executive agencies alike.<p>



<p>



Sawyer's active involvement in legislative affairs undercut Springmeyer's

influence. Springmeyer countered with legislative roadblocks against the

governor's programs and with embarrassing check audits of his office and

mansion. Beginning his second term, Sawyer decided to work for a bill to

consolidate the legislative counsel with another agency and make nonlawyer

Springmeyer ineligible to be its head.<p>



<p>



Sawyer's third objective was a progressive legislative program. In a blunt

message to the legislature he outlined bills for education, conservation,

high-way safety, civil rights, water control, and regulation of securities and

land sales. It was the most ambitious program ever proposed by a Nevada

governor.<p>



<p>



Sawyer's legislative strategy relied on surprises and nonpartisanship. His

reorganization, drafted by aides in less than two months, had the advantage of

taking both the legislators and the vested interests by surprise. He hoped to

push it through before substantial opposition developed. He had enough votes in

the Democratic Assembly to pass the reorganization, but the Senate was

controlled by the Republicans, 9 to 8.<p>



<p>



The reorganization bills passed the Assembly easily and came before the Senate.

In the first test, the Senate committee hearings, the nine Republicans voted as

a bloc and methodically cut the heart out of the reorganization. Then James

Slattery, a conservative Republican senator from a rural district with a

population of 675, bolted and voted for the original administration bill. The

other reorganization bills were quickly passed in only slightly modified form.

A week later, after the close of the session, the governor fired the director

of state welfare, a lady who had held the post for thirteen years and who was

also an arch-enemy of Senator Slattery. When Republicans charged that a deal

had been made, the governor denied it, saying that he had been considering the

dismissals for a long time. Deal or not, it was all over. Springmeyer was

removed as legislative counsel through the bill reorganizing his office, 70

percent of Sawyer's legislation was passed, and Nevada had a new director of

welfare and its first reorganized government since statehood in 1864.<p>



<p>



The first test of Sawyer's newly won power came shortly after the 1963

reorganization. One of the bills which the governor had lost in that session

was a bill to create a state park at beautiful Lake Tahoe, which was rapidly

being threatened by encroaching casinos, motels, restaurants, and cabins.

Although the session was over, Sawyer made it clear that he considered that the

fight was on. He organized an overnight camping trip to the proposed park area,

inviting a number of state officials and conservationists. The newsmen put on

hiking boots and shouldered sleeping bags, and sent back pictures of the

governor brewing coffee at the campsite above sparkling Lake Tahoe. <p>



<p>



Public support for the Tahoe park began to reach the legislators. Those from

northeastern Nevada, where Lake Tahoe is situated, found increasing pressures

upon them to get a park. Governor Sawyer decided that the time was ripe and

called a special session of the legislature to consider a critical school

funding problem posed in certain school districts, particularly Clark County,

together with a request for Lake Tahoe Park. The northeastern legislators, with

public pressure on them, made a deal with the Clark County legislators, who

wanted school appropriations. Sawyer had done a masterful job of combining two

bills badly needed by different sections of the state. Both bills passed.<p>



<p>



The 1964 elections were the first voter test of the Sawyer administration after

the reorganization. The Assembly remained Democratic, and the Senate passed

into Democratic control for the first time in the twentieth century. With the

threat of the Senate's veto removed, Sawyer was in firm control of the 1965

legislative session. Controversial bills which had failed in the past, such as

civil rights, the creation of a department of mental hygiene, securities

regulation, advertising regulation, and an administrative procedures act, were

all part of the successful Sawyer package.<p>



<p>



Sawyer's personal influence upon Nevada affairs was also demonstrated during

the Watts riots of 1965. A rumor had started in Las Vegas that a busload of

armed Negroes who had escaped from Watts were on their way to Las Vegas.

Excited whites made a run on firearms stores, and the Negro section was tense,

many Negroes having been sent home by their worried employers. The governor and

his able executive administrator, Richard Ham, went directly to the Negro

section, the "Westside," stopped on the streets to talk and shake hands,

visited the largest club in the area. Within minutes the word had spread

through the Westside that the governor was there. The band played, the governor

joked, and moved on to another club, and the tension began to ease.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Although Sawyer's political mystique in Nevada is impressive and his

legislative successes and prestigious administration of the statehouse real

enough, he is having a tough race in his bid this year for a third four-year

term. He is opposed by Lieutenant Governor Paul Laxalt, forty-three, an

attractive and articulate attorney who won the GOP gubernatorial nomination

last September easily while Sawyer was fighting off five opponents in the

Democratic primary. Laxalt starts with the advantage of being able to blame the

shortcomings of the Casino Era on Sawyer and the entrenched Democratic machine,

without himself having to disavow the era. Sawyer finds himself in the

uncomfortable position of having been an apologist for Nevada gambling who

never admitted, despite his record of reform, that the value system of the

Casino Era had to be rejected. Thus Sawyer, who has tried to be all things to

all voters, is having difficulty showing, on the one hand, that he has done

enough to meet the needs of his changing state, and on the other hand, that he

has not gone too fast.<p>



<p>



Paul Laxalt is one of those amazingly confused political creations of the

American West. An early Goldwater supporter in 1964, he has tried to erase the

stigma of his right-wing associations by backing a denunciation of the John

Birch Society at the GOP state convention last June and bringing in Governor

Romney to campaign for him. He is at times a distressingly naive politician

(during the 1965 legislative debate on the Sawyer civil rights bill, which he

opposed, he asked an opponent in all seriousness whether he would like his

daughter to marry a Negro), but he is handsome and charming, has good rapport

with the press, and has a large following from the influential Basque community

from which he comes. He provided effective leadership for the Republicans in

the legislature during his four years as lieutenant governor, despite his

failure to stop the Sawyer reorganization. Since then he has become more

liberal, and now charges the Sawyer administration with taking insufficient

measures to attract industry to Nevada and to counteract rising unemployment in

Clark County. He has even won over some labor support by defending the "right

to strike" in the aftermath of last year's crippling test-site strike and a

violent cab dispute this year.<p>



<p>



Sawyer also has problems in his own party. The Nevada Democratic Party is beset

with factionalism, and although the governor is nominal head of the party, he

does not control it. Nevada's senators, Democrats Alan Bible and Howard Cannon,

have their own factions within the party. Bible still holds remnants of the old

McCarran machine and is closest to the Sawyer camp. Cannon is Sawyer's most

important Democratic rival, with a well-organized machine in populous Clark

County. Cannon supporters distrust Sawyer's political intentions, pointing out

that should Sawyer be re-elected this year, he would be available to run

against Cannon in 1970. Sawyer supporters blame the Cannon machine for Laxalt's

election as lieutenant governor in 1962, and Cannon supporters blame the Sawyer

machine for Cannon's squeaky eighty-four-vote victory over Laxalt in the 1964

Senate race. Both camps know that a return to factional fighting would be

disastrous for the Democratic Party, but backbiting is a way of life for Nevada

Democrats, and distrust will probably continue to plague the party.<p>



<p>



The problems of the gambling industry hang heavily over the 1966 Nevada

elections. The gambling industry is in its deepest trouble since gambling was

legalized in 1931, with average winnings by the casinos down and more and more

Nevadans talking of higher gaming taxes. The legislature has authorized a

$120,000 study to see whether gambling taxes should be raised. A new civic

organization formed by Joe Matthews, a former Los Angeles political worker who

came to Nevada to work on the 1964 centennial, is calling for gambling taxes to

be tripled and is attempting to collect 14,000 signatures for a statewide

referendum next year.<p>



<p>



Meanwhile, the federal government is not making things any easier. The Justice

Department, the FBI, and the Internal Revenue Service have been investigating

Nevada gambling for some time. In 1962, Attorney General Robert Kennedy sent a

task force of agents into Nevada to search for links between the casinos and

organized crime. This summer, the FBI agent in charge at Las Vegas testified at

a U.S. court hearing in Denver that in 1963 the FBI had wiretapped the office

of Ruby Kalod, major owner of the Desert Inn and the Stardust casinos. Governor

Sawyer immediately called upon Nevada district attorneys to prosecute federal

agents for violation of Nevada's anti-wiretapping law. The crux of the

controversy is that the federal government believes that racketeers are running

some casinos behind "fronts," that gangster funds are being sent into Nevada to

be "cleaned up" through phony gambling transactions, and that casinos are

"skimming" (removing house winnings from casino counting rooms before they are

tallied for tax purposes). Although it is likely that the FBI has not used

wiretapping in Nevada for several years, Nevada officials, smarting from

criticism of their regulatory procedures, are out to get their pound of

flesh.<p>



<p>



In the wiretap controversy, Nevada seems to be right and the FBI wrong. But

thoughtful Nevadans know that the real issue is whether Nevada regulatory

procedures are sufficient. It is unlikely that either Sawyer or Laxalt will

call for a tougher gaming control bill, but defects in the present regulation

are becoming more apparent.<p>



<p>



Sawyer has managed to stay on the good side of the majority of the gambling

interests despite his reforms. The casinos were not happy with his 1959 gaming

control bill, but they accepted it grudgingly. Although the new legislative

programs have cost money and so have increased the need for higher taxes,

Sawyer has opposed Matthews' referendum to increase gambling taxes. No one

really knows whom the casinos are supporting in the Sawyer-Laxalt race. One

casino owner, Major Riddle of the Dunes, informed his employees by memo that

they should "re-elect...certain people who are running the legislature,

governorship and various other offices who have made it possible for the

success of the various hotels and casinos," and that word "re-elect" doesn't

seem to leave much room for doubt. On the other hand, Laxalt has stated that

economy and budgetary controls should be exercised instead of raising taxes, to

which the casinos say "Amen," and he is said to be receiving sizable

contributions from several casinos.<p>



<p>



It is doubtful whether the term "the gambling establishment" means much anymore

in Nevada. The Nevada Resort Association, which purports to speak for casinos

and clubs and provides a ratings sheet on candidates, represents only eleven

casinos. The operators of the big casinos, such as Moe Dalitz of the Desert Inn

and the Stardust, Mrs. Warren Bayley of the Hacienda and the New Frontier, and

Bill Harrah of Harrah's Club, do not speak for more than a segment of the

industry. About all that can be said with certainty is that the gambling

industry is fragmented, that the casinos will support both gubernatorial

candidates as long as either has a chance of winning, and that, in a tight

spot, as is foreseen in the near future, they will attempt to bring their

combined influence to bear on all levels of Nevada government.<p>



<p>



With only a month remaining in the campaign, Sawyer and Laxalt are engaged in

one of the hardest fought gubernatorial contests in recent years. Sawyer stands

on his record of sound fiscal and administrative policies, strong leadership,

reform of state government, and progressive legislation. Laxalt points to

Sawyer's failure to attract sizable new industries, the downturn in Las Vegas'

building boom, and the increase in unemployment, weaknesses of Sawyer's labor

policies, mismanagements in some executive departments, and heavy-handedness of

administration tactics. This campaign has come closer to discussing real issues

than any other in the past, owing, no doubt, to the fact that Nevada--its

economy, its values, and its future --is at a critical juncture. Few solutions,

however, have been proposed, and there seems to be more fundamental agreement

between the two contenders than dissension. Both agree that education must get

more money, state institutions must be improved, labor problems settled, urban

planning started, and state government made more responsible. Laxalt tends to

express a conservative's dislike for governmental controls while criticizing

Sawyer for failure to take action to meet problems. Sawyer talks about bold

action while defending status quo policies and painting an overly rosy picture

of the true situation. But both have shown an awareness that the Casino Era is

ending and that gambling is no longer a Nevada deity, despite their reluctance,

at the moment, to propose sweeping reforms. The bookmakers now give Sawyer a

slight edge, but they always add that it's a horse race to the finish.<p>



<p>



1966 is a pivotal year for Nevada. The gubernatorial election is another sign

that Nevada has embarked on the road to becoming just another American state.

Difficult days are ahead for its gaming industry, and the transition pains of

the post-Casino Era may be unpleasant. But the Casino Era is drawing to a

close, and few Nevadans will mourn its passing.

	<font size=5>Q</font>UESTIONS haunt the decision by Massachusetts's
 Republican governor, <a href="http://www.magnet.state.ma.us/gov/wbio.htm">William
F. Weld</a>, to run against the incumbent Democratic senator <a href="
http://www.vote-smart.org/congress/ma/ma-jr-a/">John F. Kerry</a> this
year. Is it the wrong race? Is it the wrong year? Is Kerry the wrong target?
The right race, this theory goes, was the last Senate race in Massachusetts.
The right year was 1994. The right target was Senator <a href="
http://www.vote-smart.org/congress/ma/ma-sr-a/">Edward M. Kennedy</a>.<p>

<img src="politics.gif" align=left hspace=10 
vspace=10> In 1994 Republicans won the House for the first time in forty years.  They 
captured the Senate.  They all but swept the governorships.  They defeated Ann 
Richards and Mario Cuomo.  They unseated the speaker of the House, Tom 
Foley, and old bull Dan Rostenkowski.  In negative ads Democrat after 
Democrat was morphed into Bill Clinton, who had bet his presidency on 
health-care reform and, in a blizzard of blunders and propaganda, had 
failed utterly.  <p>

On election night, as worse news followed bad for Democrats, one race stood
out. Only one Democratic icon survived. Only one old bull remained upright.<p>

First elected in 1962, Ted Kennedy was by 1994 the longest-serving Bay State
senator since Henry Cabot Lodge (1893-1924). But 1994 was a year when the word
"incumbent" carried for much of the public the opprobrium of "pedophile." Ted
Kennedy was Mr. Liberal, and in 1994 the health-care fiasco had made liberalism
look more than ever like a plot spun by elitists and bureaucrats to straighten
out (pace Kant) the crooked timber of humanity. Ted Kennedy had lived like a
Kennedy far past the point where that was fashionable or even tolerable; and
1994 was a year of such retching virtue that one candidate (in Indiana)
borrowed<i> </i>a dog to crown the tableau of domestic felicity shown in his
ads--Mom, Pop, the kids, <i>somebody get us a dog</i>. His opponent ran an ad
attacking him for the borrowed dog.<p>

Ted Kennedy, in short, was achingly vulnerable in 1994. As late as September
his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, a Mormon venture capitalist running for
elective office for the first time, and Kennedy were in a dead heat in the
polls. But Romney had never before had "the deep frisk," which is the political
strategist John Sasso's way of saying that he had never been pawed over by the
press. In due course the deep frisk turned up workers who had been hurt by
Romney's venture capitalism. And Kennedy, in a family first, attacked Romney in
negative ads. In the event, Kennedy won by a misleadingly swollen margin of 17
percent.<p>

<font size=5>B</font>ILL Weld, through all this, was engaging in a meaningless (and mean)
re-election campaign. He had popularity to burn in 1994. Elected narrowly in
1990 against John Silber, the president of Boston University, a Democrat who
gave the inconvenient impression of being only fitfully sane, Weld had worn
well in office. He did not take himself seriously. He was known to lift the
convivial glass. Rich, well-born, married to a descendant of Theodore
Roosevelt, a WASP in one of the most Catholic states in the country, Weld got
credit for being, despite everything, a <i>regular </i>guy. Hell, he hunted
boar. But instead of using his political capital to take on Ted Kennedy, Weld
chose to run up the score against state representative Mark Roosevelt, who
carried only two of the Commonwealth's 351 cities and towns.<p>

Had Weld run against Kennedy and won, as polls suggest he would have, he might
well have been a presidential candidate in this year's Republican primaries.
Beating Kennedy would have trumped any complaints the Republican right has
against Weld. Against <a href="http://www.dole96.com/">old Bob Dole</a>, Weld would have shone as the fresh face of
1996, the opportunity candidate, the tax-cutting candidate, a self-confessed
"filthy supply-sider." <p>

So even if this election proves not to be a race too far for Weld, he may
already have lost the one big chance of his career. Weld's is a well-rounded
ambition, not the distended mania for office that crazes most politicians. It
would have taken a bit of that to face Kennedy in his family fief. Much less is
required for Kerry. <p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE political terrain this year is very different from that in 1994. Then Bill
Clinton was an albatross for Democrats; now Newt Gingrich, whom Weld has
incautiously hailed as "an ideological soulmate," is one for Republicans. Then
liberalism had seemed to overreach itself; now, owing to the radical new
Republican majority in the House, it is conservatism that appears to have gone
over the top. What's more, 1994 was an off year, when the predictably low
turnout would favor Republicans--a sect-sized minority in Massachusetts
politics. This year is a presidential-election year, when, other things being
equal, the Democratic turnout should be up. And Massachusetts remains one of
Bill Clinton's strongest states. If Clinton has coattails anywhere, he will
have them here.<p>

Also, the fury against incumbents <i>because </i>they're incumbents appears to
have abated, as voters have had a sobering look at the former insurance men and
car dealers and other nonpoliticians they elected in 1994. It's risky, too, for
sitting governors to take on incumbent senators. Typically the path of
gubernatorial aspiration goes upward, to the presidency, not laterally, to the
Senate. (Beating Ted Kennedy would have been a step up.) Only three members of
the current Senate, for example, mounted successful general-election challenges
as sitting governors against sitting senators. Wendell Ford defeated the
Republican senator Marlow Cook in Kentucky in 1974, when the Republican Party
lost forty-three House seats and four Senate seats in the aftermath of
Watergate. In 1988 Richard Bryan, a Democrat, unseated the Republican Chic
Hecht, who cut a comic figure in the Senate. Bob Graham defeated the Republican
senator Paula Hawkins in Florida in 1986, when the Democrats recaptured the
Senate after the Reagan landslide of 1980. And Hawkins was a flagrant
mediocrity. No one would call the St. Paul's, Yale, and Boston College Law
School graduate John Forbes Kerry mediocre.<p>

<font size=5>W</font>HAT people do call him is not flattering, though. What has he done for
Massachusetts? What has he done for the country? What has he done, period?
These are the questions people ask about Kerry. For a senator who has been in
office twelve years, he's curiously undefined. Weld will supply the lack.
Partly because he serves in the ample shade of Ted Kennedy, who ranks as one of
the great senators of the postwar era by reason of major legislation passed and
causes championed, Kerry rarely appears on the proscenium of politics, the
local TV news. Moreover, Kerry has sought to make his mark in un-Kennedy
areas--foreign relations, banking, commerce--for that reason as much as because
he is interested in them. <p>

Kerry's cosmopolitan childhood (his father was a career Foreign Service
officer) also hurt him. He was reared in Europe and packed off to boarding
school, with weekends spent in places on Boston's North Shore where rich people
go and are thin together. Kerry is the least-ethnic Massachusetts politician
since <a href="http://www.hri.org/hri/dukakis.html">Michael Dukakis</a>, who
discovered he was Greek about an hour before announcing his candidacy for 
President. <p>

Nor has Kerry sought to anchor himself in the Commonwealth through marriage.
His first wife, Julia Thorne, was raised in a Roman villa full of rooms and
servants. His current wife, <a href="http://www.awards.heinz.org/theinz-bio.html">
Teresa Heinz</a>, was born in Mozambique, then a
Portuguese colony. The widow of the late John Heinz, a Republican senator from
Pennsylvania, she is the heiress to the $650 million Heinz catsup fortune. Last
year, when Heinz was mugged in Washington, Kerry kept to his round of
fundraising events instead of rushing to her side. Did she miss him? "I just
needed hugs," she confided to Margery Eagan, of the <i>Boston Herald</i>. Those
may have been the four most frightening words spoken in Massachusetts
Democratic politics in decades. <p>

Though she still refers to John Heinz (not John Kerry) as "my husband," though
she is still a Republican, and though her official residence is still in
Pennsylvania, Heinz has deigned to refurbish a mansion on Beacon Hill's most
exclusive block, and frequent local sightings of her have been reported. A
veteran campaigner, an effective public speaker known for her advocacy of
environmental causes, she is now firmly with the re-election program--even
being a good sport about her money. "Do you like Massachusetts?" Kerry asked
her in a Burns and Allen routine they put on at a Saint Patrick's Day event. "I
love Massachusetts," she replied. "How much is it?" <p>

Then there is Kerry's cool, cerebral manner. Archaeologists have searched, but
have been unable to discover a single Kerry joke. <p>

Kerry accrued his Lincolnian gravity in Vietnam. Thrice wounded, he led (and lost)
men in battle. His wife says he still wakes in terror in the night. No
wonder--one of his citations is for charging a Viet Cong sniper's nest, head
on. Combat cost him. What it gave John Kerry was character.<p>
</a></h1>
"The guy has guts," Jack Blum, who investigated the drug-contra connection for
a subcommittee on terrorism that Kerry headed, told me recently. "So many
politicians are in the job so people will love them. Kerry is a throwback to
senators like Phil Hart, who, even though he came from Michigan, investigated
the auto industry. They run for office not so people will love them but to use
the powers of office"--in Kerry's case to expose betrayals of the public
trust.<p>

In three investigations during his two terms Kerry has charged targets head on.
He is a hero of a new biography of the Washington power lawyer and Democratic
pooh-bah <a href="http://www.dcia.com/bcci.html">Clark Clifford</a>. In 
<i>Friends in High Places: The Rise and Fall of Clark Clifford</i>, Douglas
Frantz and David McKean depict Kerry as the only
Democratic senator who was willing to investigate the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International and Clifford's role in its mega-larcenies. "What are you
doing to my old friend Clark Clifford?" an older southern Democrat asked Kerry
in a Senate elevator one day. Kerry made no reply, but told an aide
accompanying him, "You should hear what they say to me in the cloakroom." Not
in public life to be loved, Kerry pressed on. The evidence compiled by his
committee helped to close down a huge criminal conspiracy.<p>

Kerry went after Oliver North more than a year before Iran-contra broke,
exposing the connection between the U.S.-supported Nicaraguan contras and drug
trafficking. And when Arthur Liman, the chief counsel of the Iran-Contra
Committee, agreed to a White House demand that the committee be permitted to
see only edited portions of North's diaries, Kerry refused to go along with the
whitewash and persuaded the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to subpoena the
North diaries. This did not endear him to his colleagues, who above everything
were eager to avoid impeaching Ronald Reagan. <p>

Kerry's staff did not want him to address the explosive POW-MIA issue--nor was
he eager to touch "the third rail in his life," as one friend put it. Still, as
a decorated veteran he had political capital on Vietnam, which brought with it
responsibility. After exhaustive and emotional hearings a Kerry-chaired special
committee issued a unanimous (12-0) report that laid to rest the harrowing and
commercially robust fantasy that U.S. POWs are still being held in Indochina.
The report opened the door to the normalization of relations with Vietnam. <p>

Kerry was both a war hero and a war protester, a founder of <a href="
http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/sixties/HTML_docs/Primary/Manifestos/
VVAW_Kerry_Senate.html">Vietnam Veterans
Against the War</a>. He sees his Senate career as continuous with his anti-war
activism. Then as now, he says, he sought to hold power publicly accountable.
Making government obey the laws and its officials tell the truth, Kerry says,
is a precondition to restoring the public trust on which any progressive use of
government depends. Kerry's investigations can thus be seen as means to a
liberal end: to put government on the side of the governed.<p>

Puzzlingly, Kerry rarely mentions any of this on the campaign trail, preferring
to recommend himself as a co-sponsor of the reauthorization of the Marine
Mammal Protection Act.<p>

<font size=5>B</font>Y comparison with the Kennedy-shadowed John Kerry, Bill Weld is an open book.
Critics say Weld is a total opportunist. That he is driven by polls. That he is
not a conviction politician. This criticism is jejune. These characteristics
are virtually a job description for politicians. What's remarkable about Weld
is the degree to which he has kept to his course.<p>

He has not raised taxes. He has publicly disagreed with Cardinal Bernard Law
over abortion--and he was booed at the 1992 Republican Convention for
mentioning it. He has not retreated from gay rights. He has tried to balance
environmental protection against the need for business expansion. He has come
out strongly for affirmative action. While Vice President Al Gore was telling a
New Hampshire Chamber of Commerce audience that AT&amp;T's layoff of 40,000
employees was "natural" and "efficient," Weld was calling for greater corporate
responsibility to workers and their communities in his State of the State
Address. (Secretary of Labor Robert Reich mischievously sent a copy to Gore.)
When congressional Republicans threatened to cut the Earned Income Tax Credit,
which subsidizes the wages of the working poor, Weld said that Massachusetts
would make up the difference for its EITC recipients.<p>

True, for much of last year Weld was --as Kerry, wickedly waving the bloody
shirt at the nonveteran Weld, charges--"AWOL," hunting boar and campaigning for
one (California Governor Pete Wilson). True, he throws red meat to the
talk-radio crowd--taxes, welfare, death penalty--with shameless calculation.
True, Weld has not--as the journalist Christopher Lydon claimed in an
influential <i>New York Times Magazine </i>article several years ago--changed
the political culture of Beacon Hill but has been changed by it. At the close
of the 1994 legislative session he connived in a deal of Machiavellian
effrontery with the Democratic senate president, William Bulger, and house
speaker, Charles Flaherty, to raise legislators' salaries 55 percent in return
for a cut in the state's capital-gains tax. The cut was tacked on to a bill
described simply as "tax relief for low-income families," which passed with
apparently just the principals knowing that capital gains was in it.<p>

Yet Weld's genial insouciance has helped him to navigate his contradictions.
John Sasso notes with amazement that shortly after announcing he wanted to
fingerprint welfare recipients, Weld showed up at a Cambridge party full of
high-minded friends of the poor--and was affably at ease in this liberal Zion.
The manner gap with Kerry is all in Weld's favor. <p>

So it's a strange race, pitting a rich Harvard guy raised on a Long Island
estate who married a Roosevelt against a rich Yale guy raised abroad who
married a Portuguese catsup heiress. How will this play in South Boston?<p>

<font size=5>I</font>F you survey the political topography of Massachusetts through the eyes of
Louis DiNatale, a pollster and analyst for the University of Massachusetts at
Boston-McCormack Institute, you see three pools of voters: the D pool, the R
pool, and the I pool. Let's take them in turn.<p>

Massachusetts went from being the most Republican state in the union to being
the most Democratic from the late 1920s to the late 1940s. The architect of the
shift was Senator David I. Walsh, of the central-Massachusetts industrial town
of Clinton. In the mid-twenties he fashioned the "Walsh coalition," which
became the "Al Smith coalition" and finally the "New Deal coalition." It was a
vital patchwork of the state's ethnic groups--Irish topmost, but also Italians,
Jews, Portuguese, and others--and labor unions and liberal academics and
professionals. United by interests (a desire for higher wages and safer working
conditions), ideology (a belief in government as protector and ally), and a
shared sense of exclusion from the Yankee Protestant Republican power
structure, the Walsh coalition dominated politics for decades. That Bill
Clinton can assume he'll win Massachusetts in November shows that Walsh's work
endures.<p>

Today the D pool contains 1.2 million registered voters. To carry the state
Weld has to hold Kerry to about a 60-40 win among the Ds.<p>

That's because the R pool is virtually empty. That is the big change from
Walsh's day, when Republicans were thick on the ground in the small towns of
Massachusetts. Today there are only about 400,000 left.<p>

Weld's hopes for victory rest with the I pool. Always important in
Massachusetts politics, independents now decide state elections. Under Weld
their number has swollen to 1.3 million. Weld carried them in his 1990 race
against John Silber--but John Kerry, DiNatale says, is an "I-profile D." <p>

To win, Weld will have to carry at least 55 percent of the Is, 80 percent of
the Rs, and 40 percent of the Ds. He will court the conservative Ds with his
dependable hot-button trinity of taxes, welfare, and death. He will go after
the Is by sounding like one--offering to give Hillary Clinton, with whom he
worked on the Watergate committee, a character reference, for example, as he
recently did on <i>Imus in the Morning</i>. He can count on the Rs.<p>

And Kerry? DiNatale says that Kerry's last name will help him among the
born-to-vote Irish-American civil servants who make up, for example, 40 percent
of the state's judges and 60 percent of its judicial clerks (even though Kerry
is not in fact Irish). His challenge will be not to sound so much like a D that
he loses Is, who are Is partly in order to feel superior to Ds.<p>

I think Kerry will do better among the independents than DiNatale forecasts.
They are doing better economically than Democrats, and in the 1994 midterm
elections Is leaned Democratic. Kerry's trouble is more likely to come from the
Ds.<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HIS year's election will be the first of the post-New Deal era conducted under
the frugal sign of the balanced budget. In a historic development, the two
parties now agree that fiscal balance should be the transcendent goal of
economic policy. As of June, 1995, when Clinton accepted the Republican goal of
balancing the budget, the debate has been over how little government can do,
not how much. That is a Republican debate.<p>

"Tax and tax, spend and spend"-- FDR's formula had a little-remembered third
part, "elect and elect." That was the winning formula of the Democratic Party.
Social Security, Medicare, the GI Bill, schools, roads, libraries, child
nutrition, public health, are among its monuments. Voters elected Ds because Ds
spent on what voters wanted.<p>

After the Reagan interlude of "borrow and borrow, spend and spend," Republicans
have returned to their ancestral faith in a balanced budget. It's the Democrats
who have changed. Bill Clinton has cut his party off from its past, leaving
Democrats, including John Kerry, without much different to say on
bread-and-butter issues from what Bill Weld says. Clinton may have made this a
race too far for Kerry.<p>

The irony is that Clinton has led his party into irrelevance when social and
economic circumstances should have given it a firm purchase on the politics of
remedy.<p>

A pathbreaking econometric study by the Massachusetts Institute for a New
Commonwealth, called <i>The State of the American Dream in New England</i>,
shows the opening that exists for an old-time D. From 1989 to 1994 New England
families "experienced a drop in their median real incomes of over 9 percent . .
. nearly double the 5 percent decline prevailing nationwide." In Massachusetts
the median real income of families fell from $53,330 to $49,949--a decline of
6.3 percent. Families with no children saw their real incomes fall by 9.3
percent, female-headed families by 11.8 percent, and those with less than a
high school education by 17.6 percent. Families headed by college graduates
lost 5.4 percent of their income. Even families headed by holders of
postgraduate degrees saw their incomes fall.<p>

Bill Weld trumpets the jobs he has created in Massachusetts, but the statistics
tell a different story. Fully 60 percent of the growth in the Massachusetts
labor force since 1980 has been among low-wage immigrant workers. The study is
blunt about the effects of this new flood of imported labor: "It is quite
likely that foreign immigrants are exerting a downward pressure on the low end
of the New England wage scale that is contributing to our stagnating wages and
incomes and to rising wage inequality."<p>

Falling incomes, a shrinking middle class, a growing number of
will-work-for-food immigrants--this is the state of the American Dream in
Massachusetts (where, to cite a representative figure for New England as a
whole, from 1949 to 1959 families saw their real incomes grow by nearly 55
percent). This slide in incomes has been wrought by the capricious workings of
the free market, not by government. Weld, a libertarian, believes in the free
market as a matter of principle. As senator he would strive to get government
off the backs of the downwardly mobile families of Massachusetts. No doubt that
would be a solace to them as they faced the world market alone. So much for
Bill Weld.<p>

And John Kerry? He will vote to raise the minimum wage; Weld won't. Nearly
60,000 of the worst-off families in Massachusetts would get a pay increase, and
thousands more would feel an upward pressure on their wages. Unlike Weld, he
will vote against the balanced-budget amendment, which would enshrine Herbert
Hoover's economics in the Constitution. But beyond that Kerry can't say much to
the downwardly mobile. A small increase in spending for education, a pittance
more for worker retraining, but nothing that would increase the deficit--which
is to say, nothing. And no time-outs on immigration (free labor) or foreign
competition (free trade), either. Kerry voted for NAFTA. <p>

I have said that Kerry's trouble in this election is likely to come from Ds,
who, not hearing real D talk, and not excited by Bill Clinton's in-state
crushing of Bob Dole, may fail to turn out in the kind of numbers Kerry needs
to win, repeating what happened nationwide in the 1994 midterm elections. Also,
absent the politics of remedy on economics, Ds are vulnerable to Weld-Silber
appeals to the politics of resentment. Welfare recipients and new immigrants
may be in for a rough time in Massachusetts. The whole country is in for a
rough time as both political parties turn their backs on its overriding
problem, leaving a civic void to be filled, soon enough, by extremists--the
jackals of American decline.<p>

	<font size=5>[L</font>etters which appeared in the July number of the Atlantic were selected from
William James's correspondence during the years prior to the publication of the
Principles of Psychology. In 1891 he got out the abbreviated edition known to
students all over the country as the Briefer Course, and the letter to the
publisher which follows celebrates, in a few self-derisive sentences, his
release from tasks which had absorbed his time and thought for the better part
of twelve years. He felt stale and tired; he had earned a long rest; his mind
was turning away from psychology and toward philosophy. So in May, 1892, he
went abroad to 'lie fallow' for fifteen months. The second, third, fourth, and
fifth letters refer themselves, as will be evident to the reader, to this
'sabbatical' year of absence from Cambridge.]<p>

MY DEAR HOLT,--<p>

I expect to send you within ten days the MS. of my 'Briefer Course' boiled down
to possibly 400 pages. By adding some twaddle about the senses, by leaving out
all polemics and history, all bibliography and experimental details, all
metaphysical subtleties and digressions, all quotations, all humor and pathos,
all INTEREST in short, and by blackening the tops of all the paragraphs, I
think I have produced a tome of [a] pedagogic classic which will enrich both
you and me, if not the student's mind.<p>

<p>

The difficulty is about when to correct the proofs. I've practically had no
vacation so far, and won't touch them during August. I can start them September
first up here. I can't rush them through in Cambridge as I did last year, but
must do them leisurely to suit this northern mail and its hours. I COULD have
them done by another man in Cambridge, if there were desperate hurry; but on
the whole I should prefer to do them myself.<p>

<p>

Write and propose something! The larger book seems to be a decided
success--especially from the literary point of view. I begin to look down upon
Mark Twain! Yours ever.<p>

                                                    WM. JAMES.<p>

FLORENCE, Dec. 28, 1892



<p>

MY DEAR GRACE,--<p>

I hope that my silence has not left you to think that I have forgotten all the
ties of friendship. Far from it! but have YOU never felt the rapture of day
after day with no letter to write, nor the shrinking from breaking the spell by
changing a limitless possibility of future outpouring into a shabby little
actual scrawl? Remote unwritten to and unheard from, you seem to me something
ideal, off there in your inaccessible Cambridge palazzo, bathed in the angelic
American light, occupying your mind with noble literature, pure, solitary,
incontaminate--a station from which the touch of this vulgar epistle will
instantly bring you down; for you will have been imagining your poor
correspondent in the same high and abstract fashion until what he says breaks
the charm (as infallibly it must), and with the perception of his finiteness
must also come a faint sense of discouragement as if you were finite too--for
communications bring the communicants to a common level.--All of which sounds,
my dear Grace, as if I were refraining from writing to you out of my well-known
habit of 'metaphysical politeness'; or trying to make you think so. But I think
I can trust you to see that all these elaborate conceits (which seem imitated
from the choice Italian manner, and which I confess have flowed from my pen
quite unpremeditated and somewhat to my own surprise) are nothing but a shabby
cloak under which I am trying to hide my own palpable laziness--a laziness
which even the higher affections can only render a little restless and
uncomfortable, but not dispel. However, it is dispelled at last, is n't it? So
let me begin.<p>

<p>

You will have heard stray tidings of us from time to time, so I need give you
no detailed account of our peregrinations or decisions. We had a delicious
summer in Switzerland, that noble and medicinal country, and we have now got
into first-rate shape at Florence, although there is a menace of 'sociability'
commencing, which may take away that wonderful and unexampled sense of peace. I
have been enjoying [myself] of late in sitting under the lamp until midnight,
secure against any possible interruption, and reading what things I pleased. I
believe that last year in Cambridge I counted one single night in which I could
sit and read passively till bed-time; and now that the days have begun to
lengthen and the small end of winter appears looking through the future, I
begin to count them here as something unspeakably precious that may ne'er
return.<p>

<p>

The boys are at an English school which, though certainly very good gives them
rather less French and German than they would have at Browne and Nichols's. Peg
is having first-rate 'opportunities' in the way of dancing, gymnastics and
other accomplishments of a bodily sort. We have a little shred of a
half-starved, but very cheerful ex-ballet dancer, who brings a poor little,
humble, peering-eyed fiddler 'Maestro' she calls him--three times a week to our
big salon, and makes supple the limbs of Peg and the two infants of Dr. Baldwin
by the most wonderful patience and diversity of exercises at five francs a
lesson. When one thinks of the sort of lessons the children at Cambridge get,
and of the sort of price they pay, it makes one feel that geography is a
tremendous frustrater of the so-called laws of demand and supply.<p>

<p>

Alice and I lunched this noon with young Loeser, whose name you may remember
some years ago in Cambridge. He is devoted to the scientific study of pictures,
and I hope to gain some truth from him ere we leave. He is a dear good fellow.
Baron Ostensacken is also here--I forget whether you used to know him. The same
quaint, cheerful nervous, intelligent, rather egotistic old bachelor that he
used to be, who also runs to pictures in his old age, after the strictly
entomological method, I fancy, this time; for I doubt whether he cares near as
much for the pictures themselves as for the science of them. But you can't keep
science out of anything in these bad times. Love is dead, or at any rate seems
weak and shallow wherever science has taken possession. I am glad that, being
incapable of anything like scholarship in any line, I still can take some
pleasure from these pictures in the way of love; particularly glad since some
years ago I thought that my care for pictures had faded away with youth. But
with better opportunities it has revived. Loeser describes Bocher as BASKING in
the presence of pictures, as if it were an amusing way of taking them, whereas
it is the true way. Is Mr. Bocher giving his lectures, or talks, again at your
house?<p>

<p>

Duveneck is here, but I have seen very little of him. The professor is an
oppressor to the artist, I fear; and metaphysical politeness has kept me from
pressing him too much. What an awful trade that of professor is--paid to talk,
talk, talk! I have seen artists growing pale and sick whilst I talked to them
without being able to stop. And I loved them for not being able to love me any
better. It would be an awful universe if everything could be converted into
words, words, words. <p>

<p>

I have been so sorry to hear of the miserable condition of so many of your
family circle this summer....Give my love to your brother Charles, to Sally,
Lilly, Dick, Margaret and all the dear creatures. Also to the other dears on
both sides of the Kirkland driveway. I hope and trust that your winter is
passing cheerfully and healthily away. With warm good wishes for a happy New
Year, and affectionate greetings from both of us, believe me always yours,<p>

MY DEAR HODGSON,--<p>

I am more different kinds of an ass, or rather I am (without ceasing to be
different kinds) the same kind more often, than any other living man. This
morning I knocked at your door, inwardly exultant with the certainty that I
should find you, and learned that you had left for Saltburn just one hour ago!
A week ago yesterday the same thing happened to me at Pillon's in Paris, and
because of the same reason--my having announced my presence a day too late.<p>

<p>

My wife and I have been here six days. As it was her first visit to England and
she had a lot of clothes to get, having worn out her American supply in the
past year, we thought we had better remain incog. for a week, drinking in
London irresponsibly, and letting the dressmakers have their will with her
time. I early asked at your door whether you were in town and visible and
received a reassuring reply, so I felt quite safe and devoted myself to showing
my wife the sights, and enjoying her naif wonder as she drank in Britain's
greatness. Four nights ago at 9.30 P.M. I pointed out to her (as possibly the
climax of greatness) your library<p>

windows, with one of them open and bright with the inner light. She said,
'Let's ring and see him.' My heart palpitated to do so, but it was late and a
hot night, and I was afraid you might be in tropical costume, safe for the
night, and my hesitation lost us. We came home. It is too, too bad! I wanted
much to see you, for though, my dear Hodgson, our correspondence has languished
of late (the effect of encroaching eld). my sentiments to you-ward (as the
apostle would say) are as lively as ever, and I recognize in you always the
friend as well as the master. Are you likely to come back to London at all? Our
plans did n't exactly lie through Yorkshire, but they are vague and may
possibly be changed. But what I wanted my wife to see was S.H.H. in his own
golden-hued library, with the rumor of the cab-stand filling the air....<p>

<p>

But write, you noble old philosopher and dear young man, to yours always, <p>

                                                     WM. JAMES.<p>

DARLING MILLER,--<p>

I must still for a while call you darling, in spite of your Toryism,
ecclesiasticism, determinism, and general diabolism, which will probably result
in your ruthlessly destroying me both as a man and as a philosopher some day.
But sufficient unto that day will be its evil, so let me take advantage of the
hours before 'black man-hood comes'<p>

and still fondle you for a while upon my knee. And both you and Angell, being
now colleagues and not students, had better stop Mistering or Professoring me,
or I shall retaliate by beginning to 'Mr.' and 'Prof.' you. Your letter comes
in the nick of time, for I had mislaid the Halle address and wanted to write to
you both....<p>

<p>

What you say of Erdmann, Uphues, and the atmosphere of German academic life
generally, is exceedingly interesting. If we can only keep our own humaner tone
in spite of the growing<p>

complication of interests! I think we shall, in great measure, for there is
nothing here in English academic circles that corresponds to the German
savagery. I do hope we may meet in Switzerland shortly, and you can then tell
me what Erdmann's greatness consists in. Our plans for return are not quite
settled yet....<p>

<p>

I have done hardly any reading since the beginning of March. My genius for
being frustrated and interrupted, and our unsettled mode of life, have played
too well into each other's hands. The consequence is that I rather long for
settlement, and the resumption of the harness. If I only had working strength
not to require these abominably costly vacations! Make the most of these days,
my dear Miller. They will never exactly return, and will be looked back to by
you hereafter as quite ideal. I am glad you have assimilated the German
opportunities so well. Both Hodder and Angell have spoken with admiration of
the methodical way in which you have forged ahead. It is a pity you have not
had a chance at England, with which land you seem to have so many inward
affinities. If you are to come here, let me know, and I can give you
introductions. Hodgson is in Yorkshire and I've missed him. Myers sails for the
Chicago Psychic Congress, Aug. 2nd, Sidgwick may still be had, perhaps, and
Bryce, who will give you an order to the Strangers' Gallery. The House of
Commons, cradle of all free institutions, is really a wonderful and moving
sight and at bottom here the people are more good-natured on the Irish question
than one would think, to listen to their strong words. The cheery, active
English temperament beats the world, I believe, the Deutschers included. But so
cartilaginous and unsentimental as to the Gemuth! The girls like boys and the
men like horses!<p>

<p>

I shall be greatly interested in your article. As for Uphues, I am duly up
lifted that such a man should read me, and am ashamed to say that amongst my
pile of sins is that of having carried about two of his books with me for three
or four years past, always meaning to read, and never actually reading them. I
laid them out again only yesterday to take back to Switzerland with me. Such
things make me despair. Paulsen's Einleitung is the greatest treat I have
enjoyed of late. His synthesis is to my mind almost lamentably insatisfactory,
but the book makes a station, an etape, in the expression of things.
Good-bye--my wife comes in, ready to go out to lunch, and thereafter to
Haslemere for the night. She sends love, and so do I. Address us when you get
to Switzerland to M. Ceresole, as above, 'la Chiesaz sur Vevey (Vaud),' and
believe me ever yours,<p>

                                               THE SALTERS' HILL-TOP,<p>

                                          [near CHOCORUA] Sept. 22, 1893.<p>

<p>

. . . I am up here for a few days with Billy, to close our house for the
winter, and get a sniff of the place. The Salters have a noble hill with such
an outlook! and a very decent little house and barn. But oh! the difference
from Switzerland, the thin grass and ragged waysides, the poverty stricken
land, and sad American sunlight over all--sad because so empty. There is a
strange thinness and femininity hovering over all America, so different from
the stoutness and masculinity of land and air and everything in Switzerland and
England, that the coming back makes one feel strangely sad and hardens one in
the resolution never to go away again unless one can go to end one's days. Such
a divided soul is very bad. To you, who now have real practical relations and a
place in the Old World, I should think there was no necessity of ever coming
back again. But Europe has been made what it is by men staying in their homes
and fighting stubbornly generation after generation for all the beauty, comfort
and order that they have got--we must abide and do the same.* As England struck
me newly and differently last, time, so America now--force and directness in
the people, but a terrible grimness, more ugliness than I ever realized in
things, and a greater weakness in nature's beauty, such as it is. One must
pitch one's whole sensibility first in a different key--then gradually the
quantum of personal happiness of which one is susceptible fills the cup--but
the moment of change of key is lonesome.<p>

<p>

We had the great Helmholtz and his wife with us one afternoon, gave them tea,
and invited some people to meet them; she, a charming woman of the world,
brought up by her aunt, Madame Mohl, in Paris; he the most monumental example
of benign calm and speechlessness that I ever saw. He is growing old, and
somewhat weary, I think, and makes no effort beyond that of smiling and
inclining his head to remarks that are made. At least he made no response to
remarks of mine; but Royce, Charles Norton, John Fiske, and Dr. Walcott, who
surrounded him at a little table where he sat with tea and beer, said that he
spoke. Such power of calm is a great possession. I have been twice to Mrs.
Whitman's, once to a lunch and reception to the Bourgets a fortnight ago. Mrs.
G., it would seem, has kept them like caged birds (probably because they wanted
it so); Mrs. B. was charming and easy, he ill at ease, refusing to try English
unless compelled, and turning to me at the table as a drowning man to a
'hencoop,' as if there were safety in the presence of anyone connected with
you. I could do nothing towards inviting them, in the existent state of our
menage, but when, later, they come back for a month in Boston, I shall be glad
to bring them into the house for a few days. I feel quite a fellow feeling for
him, he seems a very human creature, and it was a real pleasure to me to see a
Frenchman of B.'s celebrity LOOK as ill at ease as I myself have often felt in
fashionable society. They are, I believe, in Canada, and have only too much
society. I shan't go to Chicago, for economy's sake--besides I must get to
work. But EVERYONE says one ought to sell all one has and mortgage one's soul
to go there; it is esteemed such a revelation of beauty. People cast away all
sin and baseness, burst into tears and grow religious, etc., under the
influence!! SOME people evidently. . . .<p>

<p>

The people about home are very pleasant to meet....Yours ever affectionately,<p>

<p>

* January 24, '94. To Carl Stumpf: 'One should not be a cosmopolitan; one's
soul becomes "disintegrated," as Janet would say. Parts of it remain in
different places, and the whole of it is nowhere. One's native land seems
foreign. It is not wholly a good thing, and I think I suffer for it.'<p>

[After the return from Europe in 1893 James plunged again into teaching and
writing. His cares and responsibilities were numerous. He gave himself little
rest, except an occasional brief escape into some such seclusion as that of the
Adirondack woods. Chiefly for practical reasons, he did a great deal of
lecturing not required by his college duties, and gave courses at summer
schools and teacher's conventions as far I west as Colorado and the Pacific
Coast during his summer vacations. These lecture engagements furnished the
occasions for several addresses that were published in The Will to Believe and
Other Essays, and others that were finally embodied in the Talks to Teachers.
Incidentally they afforded him an eagerly welcomed opportunity to become
acquainted with the Western States.] <p>

MY DEAR FRIEND,--<p>

About the 22nd! I will come if you command it; but reflect on my situation ere
you do so. Just reviving from the addled and corrupted condition in which the
Cambridge year has left me, just at the portals of that Adirondack wilderness
for the breath of which I have sighed for years, unable to escape the cares of
domesticity and get there; just about to get a little health into me, a little
simplification and solidification and purification and sanification--things
which will never come again if this one chance be lost; just filled to satiety
with all the simpering conventions and vacuous excitements of so-called
civilization; hungering for their opposite, the smell of the spruce, the feel
of the moss, the sound of the cataract, the bath in its waters, the divine
outlook from the cliff or hilltop over the unbroken forest--oh, Madam, Madame
do you know what medicinal things you ask me to give up? Alas!<p>

<p>

I aspire downwards, and really AM nothing, not becoming a savage as I would be,
and failing to be the civilizee that I really ought to be content with being!
But I wish that YOU also aspired to the wilderness. There are some nooks and
summits in that Adirondack region where one can really 'recline on one's divine
composure,' and as long as one stays up there, seem for a while to enjoy one's
birthright of freedom and relief from every fever and falsity. Stretched out on
such a shelf,--with thee beside me singing in the wilderness,--what babblings
might go on, what judgment-day discourse!<p>

<p>

Command me to give it up and return, if you will, by telegram addressed
'Adirondack Lodge, North Elba, N.Y.' In any case I shall return before the end
of the month, and later shall be hanging about Cambridge some time in July,
giving lectures (for my sins) in the summer school. I am staying now with a
cousin on Otsego Lake, a dear old country-place that has been in their family
for a century, and is rich and ample and reposeful. The Kipling visit went off
splendidly--he's a regular little brick of a man; but it's strange that with so
much sympathy with the insides of every living thing, brute or human, rank or
sober, he should have so little sympathy with those of a Yankee--who also is,
in the last analysis, one of God's creatures. I have stopped at Williamstown,
at Albany, at Amsterdam, at Utica, at Syracuse, and finally here, each time to
visit human-beings with whom I had business of some sort or other. The best was
Benj. Paul Blood at Amsterdam, a son of the soil, but a man with extraordinary
power over the English tongue, of whom I will tell you more some day. I will,
by the way, enclose some clippings from his latest 'effort.' 'Yes, Paul is
quite a CORRESPONDENT!' as a citizen remarked to me from whom I inquired the
way to his dwelling. Don't you think 'corespondent' rather a good generic term
for 'man of letters,' from the point of view of the country-town newspaper
reader? . . .<p>

<p>

Now, dear, noble, incredibly perfect Madam, you won't take ill my reluctance
about going to Beverly, even to your abode, so soon. I am a badly mixed

SWEETEST OF LIVING PEGS,--<p>

Your letter made glad my heart the day before yesterday, and I marveled to see
what an improvement had come over your handwriting in the short space of six
weeks. 'Orphly' and 'ofly' are good ways to spell 'awfully,' too. I went up a
high mountain yesterday and saw all the kingdoms of the world spread out before
me, on the illimitable prairie which looked like a map. The sky glowed and made
the earth look like a stained-glass window. The mountains are bright red. All
the flowers and plants are different from those at home. There is an immense
mastiff in my house here. I think that even you would like him he is so tender
and gentle and mild although fully as big as a calf; His ears and face are
black, his eyes are yellow, his paws are magnificent, his tail keeps wagging
all the time, and he makes on me the impression of an angel hid in a cloud. He
longs to do good.<p>

<p>

I must now go and hear two other men lecture. Many kisses, also to Tweedy, from
your ever loving,<p>

DEAR YOUNG LADIES,--<p>

I am deeply touched by your remembrance. It is the first time anyone ever
treated me so kindly, so you may well believe that the impression on the heart
of the lonely sufferer will be even more durable than the impression on your
minds of all the teachings of Philosophy 2a. I now perceive one immense
omission in my Psychology--the deepest principle of Human Nature is the CRAVING
TO BE APPRECIATED, and I left it out altogether from the book, because I had
never had it gratified until now. I fear you have let loose a demon in me, and
that all my actions will now be for the sake of such rewards. However, I will
try to be faithful to this one unique and beautiful azalea tree, the pride of
my life and delight of my existence. Winter and summer will I tend and water
it--even with my tears. Mrs. James shall never go near it or touch it. If it
dies, I will die too; and if I die, it shall be planted on my grave.<p>

<p>

Don't take all this too jocosely but believe in the extreme pleasure you have
caused me, and in the affectionate feelings with which I am, and shall always
be, faithfully your friend,<p>

                                                                 WM. JAMES.<p>

[The next letter begins by acknowledging one from Henry James in which he had
alluded to the death of a Cambridge gentleman who had been run over in the
street. William James had been called upon to announce the tragedy to the man's
wife. Henry James had closed his letter exclaiming, 'What melancholy, what
terrible duties vous incombent when your neighbors are destroyed! And telling
that poor man's wife!--Life IS heroic--however we "fix" it! Even as I write
these words, the St. Louis horror bursts in upon me in the evening paper.
Inconceivable--I can't try; and I WON'T. Strange how practically all one's
sense of news from the U.S. here is huge Horrors and Catastrophes. It's a
terrible country NOT to live in.']<p>

. . . Your long letter of Whitsuntide week in London came yesterday evening,
and was read by me aloud to Alice and Harry as we sat at tea in the window, to
get the last rays of the Sunday's [sun]. You have too much feeling of duty
about corresponding with us, and, I imagine, with everyone. I think you have
behaved most handsomely of late--and always,--and though your letters are the
great fetes of our lives, I won't be 'on your mind' for worlds. Your general
feeling of unfulfilled obligations is one that runs in the family,--I at least
am often addicted by it,--but it is 'morbid.'<p>

<p>

The horrors of not living in America as you so well put it, are not shared by
those who do live here. All that the telegraph imports are the shocks; the
'happy homes,' good husbands and fathers, fine weather, honest business men,
neat new houses, punctual meetings of engagements, etc., of which the country
mainly consists, are never cabled over. Of course the Saint Louis disaster is
dreadful, but it will very likely end by 'improving' the city. The really bad
thing here is the silly wave that has gone over the public
mind--protection-humbug. silver, jingoism, etc. It is a case of
'mob-psychology.' Any country is liable to it if circumstances conspire, and
our circumstances having conspired, it is very hard to get them out of the rut.
It MAY take another financial crash to get them out, which of course will be an
expensive method. It is no more foolish and considerably less damnable than the
Russophobia of England which would seem to have been responsible for the
Armenian massacres. That to me is the biggest indictment 'of our boasted
civilization'!! It REQUIRES England, I say nothing of the other Powers, to
maintain the Turks at that business.<p>

<p>

We have let our little place, our tenant arrives the day after to-morrow, and
Alice and I and Tweedie have been here a week enjoying it and cleaning house
and place. She has worked like a beaver. I had two days spoiled by a
psychological experiment with mescal, an intoxicant used by some of our
Southwestern Indians in their religious ceremonies; a sort of cactus bud, of
which the U.S. Government had distributed a supply to certain medical men,
including Weir Mitchell, who sent me some to try. He had himself been 'in
fairyland.' It gives the most glorious visions of color--every object thought
of appears in a jeweled splendor unknown to the natural world. It disturbs the
stomach somewhat, but that, according to W. M., was a cheap price. I took one
bud three days ago, was violently sick for twenty-four hours, and had no other
symptom whatever except that and the Katzenjammer the following day. I will
take the visions on trust!<p>

<p>

We have had three days of delicious rain--it all soaks into the sandy soil here
and leaves no mud whatever. The little place is the most curious mixture of
sadness with delight. The sadness of THINGS--things every one of which was done
either by our hands or by our planning, old furniture renovated, there is n't
an object in the house that is n't associated with past life, old
summers,--dead people, people who will never come again, etc., and the way it
catches you round the heart when you first come and open the house from its
long winter sleep is most extraordinary.<p>

<p>

I have been reading Bourget's Idylle Tragique which he very kindly sent me, and
since then have been reading Tolstoi's War and Peace, which I never read
before, strange to say. I must say that T. rather kills B., for my mind. My
moral atmosphere is, anyhow, so foreign to me, a lewdness so obligatory that it
hardly seems as if it were part of a moral donnee at all; and then his
over-labored descriptions, and excessive explanations. But with it all an
earnestness and enthusiasm for getting it said as well as possible, a richness
of epithet, and warmth of heart that make you like him, in spite of the
unmanliness of all the things he writes about. I suppose there is a stratum in
France to whom it is all manly and ideal, but he and I are, as Rosina says, a
bad combination. . .<p>

<p>

Tolstoi is immense!<p>

<p>

I am glad YOU are in a writing vein again, to go still higher up the scale! I
have abstained on principle from the Atlantic serial, wishing to get it all at
once. I am not going abroad; I can't afford it. I have a chance to give $1500
worth of summer lectures here, which won't recur. I have a heavy year of work
next year, and shall very likely need to go the following summer, which will
anyhow be after a more becoming interval than this; so, somme toute, it is
postponed. If I went I should certainly enjoy seeing you at Rye more than in
London, which I confess tempts me little now. I love to see it, but staying
there does n't seem to agree with me, and only suggests constraint and
money-spending, apart from seeing you. I wish you could see how comfortable our
Cambridge house has got at last to be. Alice, who is upstairs sewing whilst I
write below by the lamp,--a great wood fire hissing in the fireplace,--sings
out her thanks and love to you....Affectionately,<p>

DEAR MILLER,--<p>

Your letter from Halle of June 22nd came duly, but treating of things eternal
as it did, I thought it called for no reply till I should have caught up with
more temporal matters, of which there has been no lack to press on my
attention. To tell the truth, regarding you as my most penetrating critic and
intimate enemy, I was greatly relieved to find that you had nothing averse to
say about The Will to Believe. You say you are no 'rationalist,' and yet you
speak of the 'sharp' distinction between beliefs based on 'inner evidence' and
beliefs based on 'craving.' I can find nothing sharp (or susceptible of
schoolmaster's codification) in the different degrees of 'liveliness' in
hypotheses concerning the universe, or distinguish a priori between legitimate
and illegitimate cravings. And when an hypothesis IS once a live one, one RISKS
something in one's practical relations towards truth and error, WHICHEVER of
the three positions (affirmation, doubt, or negation) one may take up towards
it. THE INDIVIDUAL HIMSELF IS THE ONLY RIGHTFUL CHOOSER OF HIS RISK. Hence
respectful toleration, as the only law that logic can lay down. You don't say a
word against my LOGIC, which seems to cover your cases entirely in its
compartments. I class you as one to whom the religious hypothesis is von
vornherein* so dead, that the risk in espousing it now far outweighs for you
the chance of truth; so you simply stake your money on the field as against it.
If you SAY this, of course I can, as logician, have no quarrel with you, even
though my own choice of risk (determined by the irrational impressions,
suspicions, cravings, senses of direction in nature, or what not, that make
religion for me a more live hypothesis than for you) leads me to an opposite
methodical decision.<p>

<p>

Of course, if any one comes along and says that men at large don't need to have
facility of faith in their inner convictions preached to theme that they have
only too much readiness in that way already, and the one thing needful to
preach is that they should hesitate with their convictions and take their
faiths out for an airing into the howling wilderness of nature, I should also
agree. But my paper wa'n't addressed to mankind at large but to a limited set
of studious persons, badly under the ban just now of certain authorities whose
simple-minded faith in 'naturalism' also is surely in need of an airing --and
an airing, as it seems to me, of the sort I tried to give. But all this is
unimportant; and I still await criticism of my Auseinander-setzung of the
logical situation of man's mind gegenuber the Universe, in respect to the risks
it runs.<p>

<p>

I wish I could have been with you at Munich and heard the deep-lunged Germans
roar at each other. I care not for the matters uttered, if I only could hear
the voice. I hope you met Sidgwick there. I sent him the American
hallucination-census results, after considerable toil over them. But S. never
acknowledges or answers anything, so I'll have to wait to hear from some one
else whether he 'got them off.' I have had a somewhat unwholesome summer. Much
lecturing to teachers and sitting up to talk with strangers. But it is
instructive and makes one patriotic, and in six days I shall have finished
Chicago lectures, which begin to-morrow, and get straight to Keene Valley for
the rest of September. My conditions just now are materially splendid as I am
the guest of a charming elderly lady, Mrs. Wilmarth, here at her country house,
and in town at the finest hotel of the place. The political campaign is a bully
one. Every one outdoing himself in sweet reasonableness and persuasive
argument--hardly a dignified note anywhere. It shows the deepening and
elevating influence of a big topic of debate. It is difficult to doubt of a
people part of whose life such an experience is. But imagine the country being
saved by a McKinley! If only Reed had been the candidate! There have been some
really splendid speeches and documents. . . .<p>

DEAR GODKIN,--<p>

Thanks for your kind note in re The Will to Believe. I suppose you expect as
little a reply to it as I expected one from you to the book, but since you ask
what I DU mean by Religion, and add that until I define that word my essay
cannot be effective, I can't forbear sending you a word to clear up that point.
I mean by religion for a man ANYTHING that for him is a live hypothesis in that
line, altho' it may be a dead one for any one else. And what I try to show is
that whether the man believes, disbelieves or doubts his hypothesis, the moment
he does either on principle and methodically, he runs a risk of one sort or the
other from his own point of view. There is no escaping the risk; why not then
admit that one's human function is to run it? By settling down on that basis,
and respecting each other's choice of risk to run, it seems to me that we
should be in a clearer-headed condition than we now are in, postulating as most
all of us do a rational certitude which does n't exist and disowning the
semi-voluntary mental action by which we continue in our own severally
characteristic attitudes of belief. Since our willing natures are active here,
why not face squarely the fact without humbug and get the benefits of the
admission.<p>

<p>

I passed a day lately with the [James] Bryces at Bar Harbor, and we spoke--not
altogether unkindly--of you. I hope you are enjoying, both of you, the summer.
All goes well with us. <p>

DARLING OLD CHERUBlNI,--<p>

See how brave this girl and boy are in the Yosemite Valley!* I saw a moving
sight the other morning before breakfast in a little hotel where I slept in the
dusty fields. The young man of the house had shot a little wolf called a coyote
in the early morning. The heroic little animal lay on the ground with his big
furry ears, and his clean white teeth, and his jolly cheerful little body, but
his brave little life was gone. It made me think how brave all these living
things are. Here little coyote was, without any clothes or house or books or
anything, with nothing but his own naked self to pay his way with and risking
his life so cheerfully--and losing it--just to see if he could pick up a meal
near the hotel. He was doing his coyote-business like a hero, and you must do
your boy-business, and I my man-business bravely too, or else we won't be worth
as much as that little coyote. Your mother can find a picture of him in those
green books of animals, and I want you to copy it.<p>

DEAR MRS. WHITMAN,--<p>

I got your penciled letter the day before leaving. The R.R. train seems to be a
great stimulus to the acts of the higher epistolary activity and
correspondential amicality in you--a fact for which I have (occasional) reason
to be duly grateful. So here, in the cool darkness of my roadside
'sitting-room,' with no pen in the house, with the soft tap of the carpenter's
hammer and the pensive scrape of the distant wood-saw stealing through the open
wire-netting door, along with the fragrant air of the morning woods, I get
stimulus responsive, and send you penciled return. Yes, the daylight that now
seems shining through the Dreyfus case is glorious and if the President only
gets his back up a bit, and mows down the whole gang of Satan, or as much of it
as can be touched, it will perhaps be a great day for the distracted France. I
mean it may be one of those moral crises that become starting points and
high-watermarks and leave traditions and rallying-cries and new forces behind
them. One thing is certain, that no other alternative form of government
possible to France in this century could have stood the strain as this
democracy seems to be standing it....<p>

<p>

As for me, my bed is made: I am against bigness and greatness in all their
forms, and with the invisible molecular forces that work from individual to
individual, stealing in through the crannies of the world like so many soft
rootlets, or like the capillary oozing of water, and yet rending the hardest
monuments of man's pride, if you give them time. The bigger the unit you deal
with, the hollower, the more brutal, the more mendacious is the life displayed.
So I am against all big organizations as such, national ones first and
foremost: against all big successes and big results; and in favor of the
eternal forces of truth which always work in the individual and immediately
unsuccessful way, under-dogs always, till history comes after they are long
dead, and puts them on the top.--You need take no notice of these ebullitions
of spleen, which are probably quite unintelligible to any one but myself.<p>

                                 Ever your<p>

                                                    W.J.<p>

[The Reverend Henry W. Rankin of East Northfield, addressed in the next letter,
had supplied James with numerous references to the literature of 'conversion'
and psycho-religious phenomena. He continued to do this, generously
undiscouraged by the fact that James's views differed from his own unalterably.
Another letter to Mr. Rankin will be given in the Atlantic for September.]<p>

<p>

DEAR MR. RANKIN,--<p>

A pause in lecturing, consequent upon our mid-year examinations having begun,
has given me a little respite, and I am paying a three days' visit upon an old
friend here, meaning to leave for New York to-morrow, where I have a couple of
lectures to give. It is an agreeable moment of quiet and enables me to write a
letter or two which I have long postponed, and chiefly one to you, who have
given me so much without asking anything in return.<p>

<p>

One of my lectures in New York at the Academy of Medicine before the
Neurological Society, the subject being 'Demoniacal Possession,' I shall of
course duly advertise the Nevius book. I am not as positive as you are in the
belief that the obsessing agency is really demonic individuals. I am perfectly
willing to adopt the theory if the facts lend themselves best to it, for who
can trace limits to the hierarchies of personal existence in the world? But the
lower stages of mere automatism shade off so continually into the highest
supernormal manifestations, through the intermediary ones of imitative hysteria
and 'suggestibility,' that I feel as if no GENERAL theory as yet would cover
all the facts. So that the most I shall plead for before the neurologists is
the recognition of demon-possession as a regular 'morbid-entity' whose
commonest homologue to-day is the 'spirit-control' observed in test-mediumship,
and which tends to become the more benignant and less alarming, the less
pessimistically it is regarded. This last remark seems certainly to be true. Of
course I shall not ignore the sporadic cases of old-fashioned malignant
possession which still occur today. <p>

<p>

I am convinced that we stand with all these things at the threshold of a long
inquiry, of which the end appears as yet to no one, least of all to myself. And
I believe that the best theoretic work yet done in the subject is the beginning
made by F. W. H. Myers in his papers in the S.P.R. Proceedings.<p>

<p>

The first thing is to start the medical profession out of its idiotically
CONCEITED IGNORANCE of all such matters--matters which have everywhere and at
all times played a vital part in human history.<p>

<p>

You have written me at different times about conversion, and about miracles,
getting as usual no reply, but not because I failed to heed your words, which
come from a deep life experience of your own evidently, and from a deep
acquaintance with the experience of others. In the matter of conversion, I am
quite willing to believe that a new truth may be supernaturally revealed to a
subject when he really asks. But I am sure that in many cases of Conversion it
is less a new truth than a new power gained over life by a truth always known.
It is a case of the conflict of two SELF-SYSTEMS in a personality up to that
time heterogeneously divided, but in which, after the conversion crisis, the
higher loves and powers come definitively to gain the upper-hand and expel the
forces which up to that time had kept them down in the position of mere
grumblers and protesters and agents of remorse and discontent. This broader
view will cover an enormous number of cases PSYCHOLOGICALLY, and leaves all the
RELIGIOUS IMPORTANCE to the result which it has on any other theory.<p>

<p>

As to true and false miracles, I don't know that I can follow you so well, for
in any case the notion of a miracle as a mere attestation of superior power is
one that I cannot espouse. A miracle must in any case be an expression of
personal purpose, but the demon-purpose of antagonizing God and winning away
his adherents has never yet taken hold of my imagination. I prefer an open mind
of inquiry, first about the facts, in all these matters; and I believe that the
S.P.R. methods, if pertinaciously stuck to, will eventually do much to clear
things up. You see that, although religion is the great interest of my life, I
am rather hopelessly non-evangelical, and take the whole thing too
impersonally.<p>

<p>

But my College work is lightening in a way. Psychology is being handed over to
others more and more, and I see a chance ahead for reading and study in other
directions from those to which my very feeble powers in that line have hitherto
been confined. I am going to give all the fragments of time I can get, after
this year is over, to religious biography and philosophy. Shield's book,
Steenstra's, Gratry's, and Harris's I don't yet know, but can easily get at
them.<p>

<p>

I hope your health is better in this beautiful winter which we are having. I am
very well, and so is all my family. Believe me, with affectionate regards, <p>

                                 truly yours,<p>

                                           WM. JAMES.

<font size=5>I</font>T is a melancholy fact that poets seldom sustain their 
creative vigor and prowess into great old age.  The reasons for this are 
both self-evidently actuarial and curiously inscrutable.  By the time <A 
HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/whitman/walt.htm">Walt Whitman</A> came to be 
hailed as the "good gray poet," complete with photogenic Old Testament 
beard, he was virtually a poet emeritus, occupying himself with writing 
"annexes" for <A 
HREF="http://www.cc.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/whitman/index.html"><I>Leaves 
of Grass </I></A> under the doleful rubrics "Sands at Seventy" and "Goodbye 
My Fancy." <A 
HREF="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/wordsworth/">William 
Wordsworth</A>, the longest-lived of his storied generation of English 
Romantics, appraised the dire effects of the aging process on those in his 
line of work in a couplet that has since come to have a proverbial ring: 
"We Poets in our youth begin in gladness; / But thereof come in the end 
despondency and madness."<P>

<A HREF="kunindex.htm"><img

alt="(Related Articles)"></A>

That sounds gloomy beyond the call of duty.  Still, it succinctly lays out 
one plausible hypothesis for the high incidence of burnout among poets of a 
certain age.  Ample supporting evidence for the Wordsworthian position can 
be had by thumbing the anthologies that make a clerical fetish of listing 
dates of composition: the numbers suggest that a bitter dotage is more 
often than not a self-imposed sentence, the fateful consequence of 
extravagant ambition or of a prematurely autumnal disposition.  Throw in 
the scourges of obscurity, the blandishments of reputation, and the 
capriciousness of taste, common occupational hazards all, and it can seem a 
wonder that any poet would go to heroic measures to ward off 
disillusionment.  Just as telling, perhaps, are the concessions one finds 
even a grand old lion like <A 
HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/yeats/bogan.htm">William Butler Yeats</A> 
making to diminishing returns and dimming powers.  "Now that my ladder's 
gone," Yeats signed off famously in one of his last poems, "The Circus 
Animals' Desertion," "I must lie down where all the ladders start / In the 
foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart." <P>

Despondency and madness?  Rags and bones?  Is that all that a poet has to 
look forward to at the end of the day?  Ironically, it is Yeats himself who 
may be readily adduced by those who cherish hopes for a more sanguine 
outcome.  When <A 
HREF="http://www.usl.edu/Departments/English/authors/eliot/">T.  S.  
Eliot</A> delivered the first annual Yeats Lecture at <A 
HREF="http://www.adnet.ie/abbey/theatre.html">Dublin's Abbey Theatre</A>, 
shortly after the Irish poet's death, he made a special point of lauding 
the drive and stamina that Yeats mustered in producing some of his most 
vital work in his seventh and eighth decades.  As against the greater share 
of poets, whose "writing becomes an insincere mimicry of their earlier 
work" or who "leave their passion behind, and write only from the head, 
with a hollow and wasted virtuosity," the older Yeats, Eliot declared, 
stands as "a great and permanent example--which poets-to-come should study 
with reverence."<P>

Nor is Yeats the only one.  <A 
HREF="http://pages.ripco.com:8080/%7Emws/hardy.html">Thomas Hardy</A>, <A 
HREF="http://www.uchile.cl/WWW/nerudaing.html">Pablo Neruda</A>, <A 
HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/dykki/poetry/milosz/milcov.html">Czeslaw 
Milosz</A>, Robert Penn Warren, and William 
Carlos Williams all leap to mind as elder poets whose late or last work 
elicits unqualified esteem, leaving one to conclude, all things considered, 
that maybe the ranks are not so very sparse after all.  And then there is 
the great and permanent example of Stanley Kunitz, who not 
only has continued to write poems of a startling richness at an advanced 
age but has arguably saved his best for last.  Remarkable enough that a 
poet would publish a collection at ninety, as Kunitz did last fall, and yet 
it's a measure of the man that bowing to his eminence would amount to an 
impertinence.  What <I>Passing Through</I> confirms, beyond the faintest 
suggestion of charity, is that the venerable doyen of American poetry is 
still a poet in his prime.  <P> <BR>

<font size=5>T</font>HE century--the American Century, as Henry Luce would 
later coronate it--was new when Stanley Kunitz was born, and in most 
respects it had yet truly to begin.  Kunitz's home town of Worcester, 
Massachusetts, an industrial Sparta located some forty miles west of 
Boston's self-proclaimed Athens, had been a regular stop on the New England 
lyceum circuit in the second half of the nineteenth century, and for a 
precocious child of Kunitz's generation there must have been plenty of 
lingering ghosts in the air: illustrious Transcendentalists such as <A 
HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/nov1857/waldo.htm">Emerson</A> and <A 
HREF="http://miso.wwa.com/~jej/1thorea.html">Thoreau</A>, eminent Victorians 
such as <A HREF="http://hum.ucsc.edu/dickens/index.html">Charles 
Dickens</A> and <A 
HREF="http://library.utoronto.ca/www/utel/rp/authors/arnold.html">Matthew 
Arnold</A>, the abolitionist hero <A 
HREF="../../../atlweb/flashbks/Black/Douglas.htm">Frederick Douglass</A>, 
all of whom had barnstormed through town and brought out the throngs.<P>

By the time Kunitz was a schoolboy, of course, the genies of the modern age 
were out of the bottle.  The late <A HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/longfel/HWLindex.htm">Henry Wadsworth 
Longfellow,</A> he of the spreading chestnut tree and the forest primeval, 
may still have been cherished in the sitting rooms of Worcester, but his 
days as a pillar of national letters were clearly numbered.  Ezra Pound and 
his cohort would see to that, and they were already turning out poems and 
broadsides that spoke of accelerated expectations and manifest destinies 
every bit as forcefully as did Teddy Roosevelt's flashing 
spectacles and gleaming incisors.<P>

If artistic temperament could be reduced to the handy coordinates of time 
and place, then Kunitz by all rights should have made his name as a poet 
bent on making things new, in sync with a nation that was just then 
beginning to stretch its limbs as a political power and to wrench its 
literary culture once and for all free of Europe's.  As it happened, this 
offspring of immigrants from Lithuania's Jewish shtetls went on to become a 
stubbornly American poet of singular intuitions and convictions, one 
determined to write, as he would reflect decades later, in a lyric vein 
that would thrust him into "the thick of life .  .  .  caught in the 
dangerous traffic between self and universe." In vivid contrast to the two 
other notable American poets who were born in Worcester, though a few years 
later, Kunitz found his true pitch not in scrupulous reserve and ironic 
distance (Elizabeth Bishop), not in boisterous epic sweep 
and nativist sentiment (Charles Olson), but in pensive, 
prayerful utterance.  Neither radical nor reactionary, answering to no 
mandarin aesthetic or modernist insurrection, Kunitz's poetry has kept its 
own lonely counsels, austere of bearing and constrained in form, yet 
uninhibited in its depth of human sympathy and tragic feeling.  What has 
emerged from this monkish discipline is poetry rooted in the American 
meditative vernacular and at the same time reaching back to an Old World 
oracular tradition of incantation and lamentation--that, and an unnerving 
strain of astringent grandeur that is entirely Kunitz's own.  <P>

For a writer whose working life spans thirteen Presidents and perhaps as 
many literary zeitgeists, Kunitz's steadfastness is all the more 
extraordinary. No poet of stature has proved less quixotic or less 
profligate, and it's hard to think of many who have paced themselves so 
well. Few have been as resistant to the long poem and the epic conception, 
those bogeys that have devoured so many American poets, and perhaps only 
the famously fastidious Bishop showed any greater immunity to fever dreams 
of productivity. It would be a mistake, however, to equate this reticence 
with diffidence. What Kunitz's work lacks in glamour and commotion it 
compensates for in serious and decisive purpose. That no shelf will ever 
groan under Kunitz's collected poetry is a measure of his daunting 
ambition as well as of his scrupulous restraint.<P>

"Poets are always revisiting the state of their innocence, as if to be 
renewed by it," Kunitz has written, yet that sounds more wishful than true 
of his own star-crossed upbringing. His childhood household was a 
conspicuously matriarchal one, his father having taken his own life six 
weeks before the son's birth, and his mother remaining unbending in her 
edict that her husband's name not be uttered in her presence ("She locked 
his name / in her deepest cabinet / and would not let him out, / though I 
could hear him thumping," Kunitz writes in "The Portrait"). Raised largely 
by nursemaids, free to roam the wooded countryside and haunt the public 
library and the art museum, he turned that independence to good advantage 
and went on to a stellar career at Harvard, from which he graduated summa 
cum laude in 1926.<P>

At Harvard, Kunitz was recognized as a promising scholar and a precocious 
poet, but when his hopes for a faculty position at the college were dashed 
by the administration's veiled but inescapable intimation that his Jewish 
ancestry would make any such appointment impossible, he bitterly renounced 
academic life.  The years of peripatetic and hard-pressed living that 
followed (as a reporter in Worcester, an editor in New York, and later, 
during the Depression, a small farmer in Connecticut and Pennsylvania) did 
not, however, stifle his private writing life, and in 1930 he published his 
first volume of poetry, <I>Intellectual Things</I>.  The poems were dense, 
fiercely wrought, intricately figured--and for their day rather beyond the 
pale.  They gave the impression of owing more to the metaphysicals than to 
the moderns and of being nourished on a Yeatsian diet of eroticized 
mysticism.  Formally accomplished, they were nonetheless humming with a 
cathartic energy that set them apart from the dominant strains of American 
lyric poetry: the shrewd vernacular mode of <A 
HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/frost/frostint.htm">Robert Frost</A>, the 
cool, allusive vein of Eliot, and the linguistic legerdemain of <A 
HREF="http://www.english.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/stevens-poems.html">Wallace 
Stevens</A>.<P>

The poems in <I>Intellectual Things</I> and in Kunitz's similarly pitched 
subsequent volume <I>Passport to the War</I> (1944) were not calculated to 
suit the taste of the literary establishment.  Still, their intensity did 
catch the notice of his peers, particularly those at odds with the lofty 
postures of the high moderns.  His younger contemporary Theodore Roethke, 
who was in the midst of his own revolt against the emotionally distanced 
verse then in favor, was an early ally and for a time the reclusive 
Kunitz's only link to the active guild of letters.  Reading these early 
pieces now (a healthy selection can be found in <I>The Poems of Stanley 
Kunitz</I> <I>1928&#173;1978</I>), one can't help being struck by their 
extremity of feeling, which seems both to hark back to the harnessed 
passion of English poets such as George Herbert and <A 
HREF="http://library.utoronto.ca/www/utel/rp/authors/donne.html">John 
Donne</A> and to anticipate the jangled idiom of exposed nerves that poets 
like <A 
HREF="http://rowan.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/HRC/FindingAides/Lowell.Bio.html">Robert 
Lowell</A> and <A 
HREF="http://www.metronet.lib.mn.us/lol/umn-ber1.htm">John Berryman</A> 
would popularize a generation later.  Even so, these qualities were 
liabilities in a period that still looked to such polished cosmopolitans as 
Eliot and <A 
HREF="http://british.books@american.prices.com/books/1250/1272midi.html">W.  
H.  Auden</A> for its gold standard in poetry.  By his early fifties Kunitz 
seemed destined at best to remain that poor forked thing, a poet's poet.<P>

All that changed with a thunderclap in 1958, with the publication of 
Kunitz's <I>Selected Poems 1928&#173;1958</I>, which assembled a powerful 
group of some thirty new poems alongside many from his two previous 
collections.  The book was awarded the 1959 Pulitzer Prize in poetry, and 
assured Kunitz an acclaim that now seems less overdue than necessarily 
long-ripening.  Virtually from that moment on he has been not only one of 
the most widely admired figures in contemporary poetry but also, rarer 
still, a true ambassador of his art: a revered teacher for many years at 
Columbia University, a judicious consultant to the <A 
HREF="http://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</A>, a judge for the Yale 
Series of Younger Poets, and an august presence behind such institutions as 
the <A HREF="http://www.tmn.com/Artswire/poets/page.html">Academy of 
American Poets</A>, the <A 
HREF="http://www.tiac.net/users/ptown/fawc.html">Fine Arts Work Center</A> 
in Provincetown, and Poets House, a literary center and 
poetry library in New York.  Most extraordinary of all, the Kunitz of the 
past forty years has been a measurably finer poet than he was in the first 
half of his life, amassing a body of such starkly powerful lyric poems as 
to make all that came before them seem an extended apprenticeship.  They 
are, in all their outward simplicity and inward mystery, perhaps the 
closest that American poetry has come in our time to achieving an urgency 
and aura that deserve--even demand--to be called visionary.<P> <BR>

<font size=5>I</font>T is a metamorphosis that has invited deeper wonder with each successive  
collection of Kunitz's poems, and never so irresistibly as with <I>Passing 
Through</I>, released in November to coincide with the poet's ninetieth 
birthday and promptly garlanded with the National Book Award. Here, in a 
trim volume that nobody could wish shorter, is virtually the entire 
windfall of Kunitz's "later" poetry: the selected contents of <I>The 
Testing-Tree </I>(1971), "The Layers" (the constellation of new poems that 
led off his 1979 edition of <I>The Poems of Stanley Kunitz</I>), and 
<I>Next-to-Last Things: New Poems and Essays</I> (1985), along with nine 
poems appearing for the first time in a book. Not a lifetime's work but 
something more seasoned and concentrated and surpassing--work with a 
lifetime steeped in it. In contrast to <I>The Poems of Stanley Kunitz</I>, 
a more substantial compilation that showed Kunitz over a span of some 
fifty years moving beyond his clenched and seething early style, 
<I>Passing Through</I> allows readers to follow the clean arc of Kunitz's 
late three decades of composition in splendid isolation. <P>

It is, above all, a book of revelations. From the beginning Kunitz's was a 
poetry consecrated to transfiguring moments of insight and rapture, and it 
is startling to discover how active that core of exaltation has remained. 
For Kunitz, as for no other first-rank American poet of his time who comes 
readily to mind, the lyric poem has been a portal into mystical 
apprehension, an article of faith that he does not shrink from making 
explicit in the preface to <I>Passing Through</I>, "Instead of a 
Foreword." Conceding nothing to postmodern anxiety and exhaustion, Kunitz 
uses his prologue to extol the poet's vocation, as "a form of spiritual 
testimony," and poetry as "ultimately mythology, the telling of the 
stories of the soul." Most contemporary poets will squirm before this 
unreconstructed Keatsian language, preferring to tender their claims in 
the clipped lingua franca of professional shoptalk, but Kunitz will have 
none of that. "If we want to know what it felt like to be alive at any 
given moment in the long odyssey of the race," he avows, "it is to poetry 
we must turn."<P>

Taken alone, such dictums might sound faintly schoolmarmish. And they 
would seem to be the very sort of didactic propositions that could all too 
easily fog a poet's wits. But in Kunitz's case quite the opposite effect 
has come to pass: hewing to the old high road of Romantic soul-making has 
steeled and steadied him, made him infinitely lighter on his feet. His 
"later" poetry does not break with the elevated designs of his earlier 
work; it's a purified, fire-tempered variant of it, and all the more 
uncompromising for being more colloquially accessible, more sparse and 
parsed, more transparent in its drift and import. The younger Kunitz often 
wound line and image and allusion so tightly that his stanzas seemed to be 
fighting for oxygen, their wrought-up prosody grimly mirroring the 
contortions of a poet groping after blinding illuminations. The older 
Kunitz has not relaxed his grip, but no longer does he strain after 
effects. Listen, for example, to this fragment: "If in my sleep / The ape, 
the serpent, and the fox I find / Shut with my soul in fortune's writhing 
sack, / I tame them with the sections of my mind / And teach my mind to 
love its thoughtless crack." And now to this: "The word I spoke in anger / 
weighs less than a parsley seed, / but a road runs through it / that leads 
to my grave." <P>

The roughly half a century that stands between the first fragment, from 
"Beyond Reason," and the second, from <A 
HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/antholog/kunitz/quarrel.htm">"The 
Quarrel,"</A> scarcely seems an adequate index of the developmental 
light-years that divide them.  Kunitz is by no stretch the only poet of 
consequence to undertake a revolution from within at mid-career, but not 
many have done so with anywhere near the same force of conviction.  As if 
determining to stalk the numinous with finer snares and stealthier 
measures, Kunitz has taken pains to unpack his syntax, to hone a compact 
two- or three-beat line, to shape his poems with idiomatic economy and 
modesty.  Still, no technical appraisal can quite take account of all 
Kunitz had to cast aside and shear away to find his way to flaying cadences 
such as these: "In a murderous time / the heart breaks and breaks / and 
lives by breaking.  / It is necessary to go / through dark and deeper dark 
/ and not to turn." <P>

This passage belongs to the closing sequence of "The Testing-Tree," the 
title poem of the 1971 collection that unveiled the spare, lean manner of 
Kunitz's later years.  Here are the acoustics and poetics--simple 
indicative speech tending toward the condition of scripture and parable, a 
tenor at once rhapsodic and intimate, a terse strain of 
self-reckoning--Kunitz has hammered into his own unmistakable register of 
sound and sense.  Let <I>Passing Through </I> fall open at random and you 
cannot but marvel at this poet's sureness of touch and tempo: like the 
dragonfly he describes in "The Catch," a Kunitz poem, one often feels, 
might best be thought of as a "delicate engine / fired by impulse and 
glitter, / .  .  .  less image than thought, and the thought come alive.  
"And it's precisely that immediacy that gives this poetry its visionary 
authenticity: no matter how far he ranges into the realm of the unconscious 
or how deeply he dwells on signs and portents, there is nothing ethereal 
about Kunitz's habits of mind.  Even at their most surreal and allegorical 
(as in <A HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/antholog/kunitz/river.htm">"King of 
the River,"</A> which sends its totem salmon hurtling toward "the threshold 
/ of the last mystery / at the brute absolute hour," or "The Knot," where 
the poet fixates on a lintel's "Obstinate bud / sticky with life / mad for 
the rain again") Kunitz's poems seem grounded and exacting in a way that 
lyrics designed to orchestrate shuddering epiphanies seldom are.  Time and 
again they take--in a phrase out of Keats's letters which Kunitz has 
acknowledged as one of his touchstones--"but three steps from feathers to 
iron." On occasion, as in "An Old Cracked Tune," they move with the 
harrowing lilt of a song out of Blake:<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<br>

<font size=5>E</font>VEN for poets nowhere near Kunitz's age, a volume of 
selected poems is usually, in one studied way or another, the formal 
unveiling of a monument, a hopeful brief for literary posterity.  But no 
such ceremony intrudes on <I>Passing Through</I>: even in its closing 
pages, where the latest of these later poems appear, Kunitz doesn't once 
seem to be posing for a marble bust or auditioning for the anthologies.  
Instead one enters the presence of an indomitable elder spirit writing with 
alertness, tenacity, and finesse, still immersed in the life of the senses 
and persisting in the search for fugitive essences.  Neither resigned nor 
becalmed, Kunitz's newest poems are by turns contemplative, confiding, 
mythic, and elegiac.  If they have the measured and worldly tone that 
befits an old master, they also have the ardent and questing air of one 
whose capacity for artless wonder seems inexhaustible.  "What makes the 
engine go?" Kunitz asks in <A 
HREF="../../../atlweb/poetry/antholog/kunitz/touchme.htm">"Touch Me,"</A> 
as he kneels in his cricket-riddled garden and marvels "like a child again 
/ .  .  .  to hear so clear / and brave a music pour / from such a small 
machine." And the answering line speaks for the persistence of Kunitz's 
music as well: "Desire, desire, desire."<P>

Perhaps the ultimate tribute to this book is 
to say that one closes it with no certainty that it's going to stand as the 
poet's last word.  Little in these poems puts one in mind of postscripts or 
epitaphs, and even Kunitz's most pronounced valedictory gestures seem 
somehow to steal a march on the gloaming.  Consider, for example, the 
closing lines of the book's title poem, which, its epigraph informs us, was 
composed on the poet's seventy-ninth birthday.  <P>

It should be noted that "Passing Through" is addressed to 
Kunitz's wife, Elise Asher; this is no last will and testament but a love 
poem.  The whole effect is vintage Kunitz: lines unforced and seemingly 
spontaneous yet so ineffable that one can almost imagine them having been 
inscribed on papyrus.  To write this calmly and collectedly, with a sanity 
so finely tempered that it acquires a spooky prescience, one has to have 
done more than simply endure.  And such is clearly the story behind the 
exemplary resilience of grand old man Stanley Kunitz: the fullness of time 
hasn't just left his senses intact but has concentrated his mind 
wonderfully.  That dust has moved mountains.<p>

	<font size=5>N</font>othing, perhaps, better proves the position of Washington in the estimation of

mankind than the almost absolute suppression of everything in the nature of

attack and criticism on him. A public man for forty-five years, he was the

target for the abuse and criticism that such a life implies. Yet not merely

have these been forgotten, but the very descendants of the men who were

bitterest in the attacks upon him have most carefully avoided reviving the

facts, and have actually taken every means in their power to suppress and

destroy all proof of such antagonism. As an instance of this, the biographies

of Samuel and John Adams, of Elbridge Gerry, of Jonathan and John Trumbull, and

of Richard Henry Lee, as well as such materials as exist concerning James

Lovell, William Williams, Daniel Roberdeau, and Francis Lightfoot Lee, either

are silent, or absolutely deny that these several men were concerned in the

attempt to remove Washington from the command of the continental army at one of

the most critical moments of the Revolution. As a consequence, the story of the

so-called "Conway cabal" remains shrouded in such mystery as to lose much of

its interest. The student of history stands, like the seconds in one form of

the Corsican duel, in the doorway of a darkened room, in which the two

contestants carry on their contest,--knowing nothing of what occurs except by

the observable results when the contest is concluded. That we shall ever learn

the true ins and outs of the attempt for which so large a number of the members

of the Continental Congress and so many officers in the army worked is probably

now hopeless. But it may be possible to obtain here and there a glint of light,

which will serve to make the truth more evident.<p>



<p>



In a series of letters from Benjamin Rush, who had but just left the

Continental Congress to take a medical position in the army, to John Adams,

still a member of the Congress, we can trace much of the spirit and animus

which lay back of the whole movement. That Rush was concerned in this cabal has

often been denied, despite the fact that Washington ascribed to his pen the

famous anonymous letter of the l2th of January, 1778, to Patrick Henry. But

these denials cease to be of the slightest value in the face of this

correspondence, which shows not merely that Rush was attempting to undermine

his commander in chief at least three months before the anonymous letter was

written, but even that he began his attacks before the convention of Saratoga,

which, by its popularizing of Gates, gave such vitality to the conspiracy. The

letters are so self-explanatory that they practically speak for themselves.<p>

1777.<p>



<p>



DEAR SIR,--It would have given me great pleasure to have spent an hour with you

in this place after my return from Genl. Howe's camp. I could have told you but

little of the loss of the enemy on the heights of Brandywine for I confined my

questions to subjects more interesting to my country, and which were solved

without difficulty or restraint. Let us leave to common soldiers the joy that

arises from hearing of fields being covered with dead bodies. The Statesman and

the General should esteem even victory a loss unless GLORY, or DECISIVE GOOD

CONSEQUENCES have arisen from it. I was struck upon approaching Genl. Howe's

lines with the VIGILANCE of his sentries &amp; picket. They spoke, they

stood--they looked like the safeguards of the whole army. After being examined

by 9 or 10 inferior Officers I was not permitted to enter their camp 'till an

officer of distinction was sent for, who after asking a few questions ordered a

guard to conduct me to Head Quarters.<p>



<p>



I was next struck with their attention to SECRESY in all their operations. I

was confined upon parole to the district where our wounded lay, and when the

whole army marched by my lodgings I was confined by an officer to a back room.

They lock up the houses of every family that is suspected of being in the least

unfriendly to them in their marches thro' the country, &amp; if they are

discovered by a countryman whom they suspect, they force him to accompany the

army 'till their rout[e] or disposition are so far changed that no mischief can

arise from the intelligence he is able to convey.<p>



<p>



They pay a supreme regard to cleanliness and health of their men. After the

battle on the 11th of last month the soldiers were strictly forbidden to touch

any of the blankets belonging to the dead or wounded of our army least they

should contract the "rebel distempers." One of their officers, a subaltern,

observed to me that his soldiers were infants that required constant attendance

and said as a proof of it that altho' they all had blankets tied to their

backs, yet such was their laziness that they would sleep in the dew and cold

without them rather than have the trouble of untying and opening them. He said

his business every night before he slept was to see that no soldier in his

company laid down without a blanket.<p>



<p>



Great pains were taken to procure vegetables for the army, &amp; I observed

everywhere a great quantity of them about the soldiers tents. The deputy

quarter masters &amp; deputy commissaries in Howe's army are composed chiefly

of old &amp; respectable officers, and not of the vagrants and bankrupts of the

country.<p>



<p>



Their [sic] is the utmost order &amp; contentment in their hospitals. The

wounded whom we brought off from the field were not half so well treated as

those whom we left in Gen'l Howe's hands. Our Officers and Soldiers spoke with

gratitude and affection of their Surgeons. An orderly man was allotted to every

ten of our wounded, and British Officers called every morning upon our officers

to know whether their Surgeons did their duty. You must not attribute this to

their humanity. They hate us in every shape we appear to them. Their care of

our wounded was entirely the effect of the perfection of their medical

establishment which mechanically forced happiness &amp; satisfaction upon our

countrymen perhaps without a single wish in the Officers of the hospital to

make their situation comfortable.<p>



<p>



It would take a volume to tell you of the many things I saw &amp; heard which

tend to show the extreme regard that our enemies pay to

discipline--order--economy &amp; cleanliness among their Soldiers.<p>



<p>



In my way to this place I passed thro' Genl. Washington's army. To my great

mortification I arrived at the Head Quarters of a General on an Outpost without

being challenged by a Single Sentry. I saw Soldiers straggling from our lines

in every Quarter without an officer, exposed every moment to be picked up by

the enemy's light horse. I heard of 2,000 who sneaked off with the baggage of

the army to Bethlehem. I was told by a Captain in our army that they would not

be missed in the returns, for as these were made out ONLY by SARGEANTS they

would be returned on parade, and that from the PROPER officers neglecting to

make out, or examine returns Genl. Washington never knew within 3,000 men what

his real numbers were. I saw nothing but CONFIDENCE about Head Quarters, and

languor in all the branches &amp; extremities of the army. Our hospital opened

a continuation of the confused scenes I had beheld in the army. The waste--the

peculations--the unnecessary officers &amp;c (all the effect of OUR medical

establishment) are eno' to sink our country without the weights which oppress

it from other quarters. It is now universally said that the system was formed

for the Director General &amp; not for the benefit of the sick &amp; wounded.

Such unlimited powers and no checks would have suited an angel. The sick

suffer, but no redress can be had for them. Upwards of 100 of them were drunk

last night. We have no guards to prevent this evil. In Howe's army a Captain's

guard mounts over every 200 sick. Besides keeping their men from contracting

&amp; prolonging distempers by rambling, drinking, &amp;...guards keep up at

all times in the minds of the sick a sense of military subordination. A Soldier

should never forget for a single hour that he has a master. One month in our

hospitals would undo all the discipline of a year, provided our soldiers

brought it with them from the army.<p>



<p>



I know it is common to blame our subalterns for all these vices. But we must

investigate their source in the higher departments of the army. A general

should see everything with his own eyes, &amp; hear everything with his own

ears. He should understand &amp; even practice at times all the duties of the

soldier--the officer--the Quarter Master--the Commissary--&amp; the Adjutant

General. He should be modest sober &amp; temperate, free from prejudice--he

should despise ease, and like Charles XII should always SLEEP IN HIS

BOOTS--that is, he should always be ready for a flight or a pursuit.<p>



<p>



The present management of our army would depopulate America if men grew among

us as speedily &amp; spontaneously as blades of grass. The "wealth of worlds"

could not support the expense of the medical department above two or three

years.<p>



<p>



We are waiting impatiently to hear that our army has defeated General Howe's.

Would not such an event be a misfortune to us in the end? &amp; would it not

stamp a value upon ignorance &amp; negligence which would greatly retard

military knowledge &amp; exertions among us? God I hope will save us only

through the instrumentality of human wisdom &amp; human virtue. If these are

wanting the sooner we are enslaved the better.<p>



<p>



My dear friend we are on the brink of ruin. I am distressed to see the minions

of a tyrant more devoted to his will than we are to a cause in which the whole

world is interested. New measures and new men alone can save us. The American

mind cannot long support the present complexion of affairs. Let our army be

reformed. Let our general officers be chosen annually. The breaking of 40

regiments, and the dismission of one field officer from every regiment &amp; of

one subaltern from every company will save many millions to the continent. Your

army by these means may be made respectable &amp; useful. But you must not

expect to fill it with soldiers for 3 years, or during the war. The genius of

America rebels against the scheme. Good General Officers would make an army of

six months men an army of heroes. Wolfe's army that conquered Canada was only 3

months old. Stark's militia who have cast a shade on everything that has been

done by regulars since the beginning of the war shew us what wonderful

qualities are to be called forth from our countrymen by an active &amp;

enterprising commander. The militia began, &amp; I sincerely hope the militia

will end the present war. I should despair of our cause if our country

contained 60,000 men abandoned eno' to enlist for 3 years or during the war.<p>



<p>



Adieu--my dear friend. May you never sleep sound 'till you project and execute

something to extricate and save your country. My love to Mr. Saml Adams, Mr.

Geary [Gerry], Mr. Lowell, Dr. Bronson &amp; my Br. if at Lancaster.<p>

DEAR SIR.--I have little to add to the long letter I wrote to you a few days

ago, but that the event of the battle at Germantown on the 4th instant was full

of proofs of the truths I formerly communicated to you. We lost a city, a

victory, a campaign by that want of discipline &amp; system which pervades

every part of the army. General Conway wept for joy when he saw the ardor with

which our troops pushed the enemy from hill to hill, and pronounced our country

free from that auspicious sight. But when he saw an officer low in command give

counter orders to the Commander in chief, and the comr. in chief passive under

that circumstance, his distress and resentment exceeded all bounds. For God's

sake do not suffer him to resign. He seems to possess Lee's knowledge &amp;

experience without any of his oddities or vices. He is moreover the idol of the

whole army. Make him a Major-General if nothing else will detain him in your

service. He is entitled to most of the glory our arms acquired in the late

battle. But his bravery and skill in war are not his only military

qualifications. He is exact in his discipline, and understands every part of

the detail of an army. Besides this, he is an enthusiast in our cause. Some

people blame him for calling some of OUR GENERALS cowards &amp; drunkards in

public company. But these things are proof of his integrity, and should raise

him in the opinion of every friend of America. Be not deceived my dear friend.

Our army is no better than it was two years ago. The spirit of our men is good.

Our officers are equal, nay, superior to Howe's. A few able Major Generals

would make them a terror to the whole power of Britain.<p>



<p>



                 Adieu.                         Yours sincerely,<p>



<p>



                                                               B. RUSH<p>



<p>



P.S. I am afraid we shall soon loose a most gallant officer in Col. Stone.

Congress must take notice of him living or dead. <p>



<p>



AN ANECDOTE. An officer in Howe's army told me they executed ONLY two men in

the last year. Their discipline prevents crimes. OUR WANT of it creates them.

We have had 20 executions in the last year, &amp; our army is not a bit the

better for them. If Howe should lie still, desertions, sickness, accidental

deaths &amp; executions would waste our whole army in one year.<p>



<p>



<p>



                                             READING, Octobr. 21, 1777.<p>



<p>



MY DEAR FRIEND,--I fear you will class me with the weeping philosophers of

antiquity, but I cannot help it. He who can be happy while his country is

wasting her blood, and treasure to no purpose must be more or less than a man.

General Gates' unparalleled success gave me great pleasure, but it has not

obliterated the remembrance of the disorders I have seen in the army in this

department. On the contrary I am more convinced than ever of the necessity of

discipline and system in the management of our affairs. I have heard several

officers who have served under General Gates compare his army to a well

regulated family. The same gentlemen have compared Gen'l Washington's imitation

of an army to an unformed mob. Look at the characters of both! The one on the

pinnacle of military glory--exulting in the success of schemes planned with

wisdom, &amp; executed with vigor and bravery--and above all see a country

saved by their exertions. See the other outgenerald and twice beated--obliged

to witness the march of a body of men only half their number thro' 140 miles of

a thick settled country--forced to give up a city the capitol  of a state &amp;

after all outwitted by the same army in a retreat. If our congress can witness

these things with composure, and suffer them to pass without an enquiry, I

shall think we have not shook off monarchial prejudices, and that like the

Israelites of old we worship the work of our hands.<p>



<p>



In the British army Pickets are relieved once or twice every day, and guards

every two hours. In Gen'l. Washington's army it is not an uncommon thing for

pickets to remain FIVE days &amp; guards 24 hours without a relief, and

destitute at the same time of provisions except such as they plunder or buy

with their own money. This negligence is a fruitful source of diseases in our

army.<p>



<p>



In the British army hospitals are never without guards. In G.W.'s army guards

which might save the lives of hundreds are used to parade before the doors of

our Major Generals. One of them having no less than a Sergeant &amp; 18 men to

guard himself and his baggage thro' this town.<p>



<p>



There are nearly as many officers as men in our army. Every Regiment has a

Surgeon with one or two mates. Each of these (officers--Surgeons &amp; mates)

has a Servant drawn from the ranks to attend them who is always exempted on

this acct. from camp &amp; field duty. I have been told the Genl. has forbidden

it a hundred times in GENERAL ORDERS. But the evil continues, &amp; no wonder,

for Officers ride up to his quarters with soldiers behind them in the capacity

of servants. Some of the martinets in my department have trod in their

footsteps. But I believe I have at the expense of the friendship of many of

them put a stop to the evil. Who ever heard of an army being disciplined by

ORDERLY BOOKS? You might as well think of conquering an enemy by writing

letters AT him.<p>



<p>



Don't tell me that our army has drawn Howe out of Phila. Gates has saved

Pennsylvania in the State of New York just as much as Pitt conquered America in

Germany. I have no objection to our country's being delivered by a miracle

provided we could secure a perpetuity of them. I have never heard of but one

city whose walls fell down at the blowing of a ram's horn.--military

skill--industry &amp; bravery are the ordinary weapons made use of for that

purpose. God alone I know must save us at last, but I wish for the future honor

and safety of our country he may do it thro' the INSTRUMENTALITY of human

wisdom &amp; human virtue. A peace just now would leave us without

generals--officers or soldiers in THE MIDDLE AND SOUTHERN States, and if our

deliverance is now accomplished, it has been effected thro' the instrumentality

of ignorance, idleness, and blunders.<p>



<p>



"A great &amp; good God (says Genl Conway in a letter to a friend) has decreed

that America shall be free, or -------- and weak counsellors would have ruined

her long ago."<p>



<p>



Our hospital affairs grow worse &amp; worse. There are several hundred wounded

soldiers in this place who would have perished had they not been supported by

the voluntary &amp; benevolent contributions of some pious whigs. The fault is

both in the establishment &amp; in the Director General. He is both ignorant

and negligent of his duty. There is but one right system for a military

hospital, &amp; that is the one made use of by the British Army. It was once

introduced by Dr. Church at Cambridge, and Dr. McKnight informs me that he

never has seen order, economy, or happiness in a hospital since it was banished

by Dr. Morgan &amp; his successor. My heart is almost broken at seeing the

distresses of my countrymen without a power to remedy them. Dr. S--- never sets

his foot in a hospital. Tell me, are there any hopes of our plan being mended.

Dr. Brown &amp; every medical officer in the hospital execrate it. If it cannot

be altered &amp; that soon I shall trouble you with my resignation &amp; my

reasons shall be afterwards given to the public for it. The British system

would save half a million a year to the Continent &amp; what is more, would

produce perfect satisfaction &amp; happiness.<p>



<p>



A Surgeon General is wanted in the Northern Department. Give me leave to

recommend Dr. McKnight a Senior Surgeon, in the flying hospital for that

office. He has skill, industry, &amp; humanity &amp; has served with unequalled

reputation since the beginning of the war. My love to Mess. Lovell, Dr.

Brownson &amp; my Br. add Col Walton to the number if he is still in Congress.

I should have written often to him, but had reason to think he was gone to

Georgia. You may show him such parts of this letter as you think proper.<p>



<p>



Adieu! The good Christians &amp; true Whigs expect a recommendation from

Congress for a day of public thanksgiving for our victories in the North. Let

it be THE SAME day for the whole continent.<p>



<p>



What do you think of sending home Johnny Burgoyne upon his parole? Poor boy! he

has no consolation left him but that he turns a period better than Major

General Gates.<p>



<p>



Should not General Washington immediately demand the enlargement of Genl Lee's

person upon parole within Howe's lines.<p>



<p>



What honors, or marks of gratitude will you confer on Gates, Lincoln, &amp;c?

Suppose you introduce a constellation to be worn on the breast containing 13

stars as a reward for military exploits? But nothing but heaven can ever repay

them for the services they have rendered their country.<p>



<p>



         God bless you!<p>



<p>



                      Yours sincerely<p>



<p>



                                    B. RUSH.<p>



<p>



P.S. Direct for me at Princeton, New Jersey, when you have leisure to drop me a

line.<p>



<p>



Genl. Mifflin must not be suffered to resign his command in the army. If he is,

you will soon receive a hundred others.<p>



<p>

DEAR SIR,--The disorders of our army do not proceed from any NATURAL faults in

our men. On the contrary I believe the people of America (especially the

natives) are the most TRACTABLE creatures in the world. I can say with great

certainty that I have never yet been disobeyed in a single instance by a

Virginian or a New England man in my connection with them in the hospital. I

speak therefore from observation as well as reason when I may say that our

country affords the finest materials for making good soldiers of any upon the

face of the globe. The same may be said of our officers. They are greatly

superior in education &amp; principle to the officers in the British army, most

of whom are whipped from schools or rusticated from colleges. The fashion of

blaming our soldiers &amp; officers for all the disorders of our army was

introduced in order to shelter the ignorance, the cowardice, the idleness and

the drunkenness of our major generals. The spirit of our men is good. They

possess a firmness of mind peculiar to themselves, or they must have sunk long

ago under the numberless retreats, defeats, and camp distresses to which they

have been exposed. Half the number of either of them would have broken up

Howe's army long ago, and reduced him to a single life-guard. The courage of

our men is great, in so much that there is scarcely a single instance of their

giving way where they have not first been deserted by their general officer.<p>



<p>



There is but one way of producing such a change in your army as will rectify

all the disorders which prevail in it. It is by electing your general officers

annually, in no other way will you ever purge the army. There are a hundred

things true which cannot be proved. A General may play the coward both in the

Cabinet &amp; the field, or he may raise the price of whiskey by getting drunk

every day of his life, and yet it may be impossible to prove either of these

things against him in a Court of Enquiry. The Romans never trusted to any man

but to the "Felicissimus Dux." An unsuccessful Practitioner of physic is always

ignorant or negligent of his business. In like manner I believe the always

unfortunate general is always a culpable one. You have Brigadiers in your army

who would do honor to the rank of major general in any service in Europe.

Conway and Woodward are at the head of them. You have likewise Colonels and

other field officers who would shine at the head of Brigades.

Stone--Hendricks--and Brown have not their superiors for activity, industry

&amp; military capacity in the army. I have the pleasure of informing you that

the first of them Col. Stone is in a fair way of recovering from the wound he

received at the battle of Germantown.<p>



<p>



But a change in your General Officers cannot be made. If the blood and treasure

of America must be spent to no purpose; if the war must be protracted thro'

their means for two or three generations; and if the morals &amp; principles of

our young men must be ruined thro' their examples, pray acquit yourself in the

eyes of your country &amp; of posterity by recording the two following

resolutions upon your Journals:<p>



<p>



1. Resolved that if any Major or Brigadier General shall drink more than one

quart of whiskey, or get drunk more than once in 24 hours he shall be publickly

reprimanded at the head of his division or brigade.<p>



<p>



2. Resolved that in all battles and skirmishes the Major &amp; Brigadier

Generals shall not be more than 500 yards in the rear of their respective

divisions or brigades upon pain of being tryed &amp; punished at the discretion

of a court martial.<p>



<p>



From military subjects I proceed to medical, and here was I disposed to

complain I could fill a volume. We shall never do well 'till you adopt the

system made use of in the British hospitals. The industry &amp; humanity of the

physicians &amp; surgeons are lost from the want of it. While I am writing

these few lines there are several brave fellows expiring within fifty yards of

me from being confined in a hospital whose air has been rendered putrid by the

sick &amp; wounded being crowded together. The business of the physicians, and

of the Directors or Surveyors ought to be wholly independent of each other, and

in no case should the latter dictate to the former--We see, we feel the

distresses of the sick, and therefore are better capable of directing

everything necessary for their convenience than men who never go into a

hospital but who govern them by proxy as Genl Schuyler commanded Ticonderoga at

Albany. The following resolutions would remedy many abuses and prove the means

of saving the lives of hundreds before the campaign is over.<p>



<p>



1. Resolved, that the Director &amp; Ass. Director furnish the Physician &amp;

Surgeons Generals &amp; Senior Surgeons with such medicines, stores &amp;

accommodations as they shall require. The requisition to be made in writing

&amp; to be used afterwards as a voucher for the expenditures of the D.

General.<p>



<p>



2. That all the Accts. of the D. General for medicines, wines, stores &amp;c.

be certified by the Phy: or Surgeons General before they are passed.<p>



<p>



This resolution is of the utmost importance, and I have good reason to say will

save thousands to the continent.<p>



<p>



3. That all returns of sick, wounded, &amp; of officers of the hospital be

delivered to the Medical Committee by the Phy: or Surgeons General. The reason

of this is plain. They can have no interest in making out false returns and the

returns from them will always be a check upon the expenditures of the Director

General.<p>



<p>



Adieu--my dear friend--Best compts. to Dr. Geary, Mr. Saml Adams, Mr. Lovell,

and all such of our old friends as prefer poverty with republican liberty to

wealth with monarchial infamy &amp; slavery.<p>



<p>



Should you think it worth while to read any parts of this letter to any of them

it will perhaps give some weight to them if you conceal the name of your friend

&amp; humble sert.                B. RUSH.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The intense feeling displayed in these communications, as well as in the

already alluded to anonymous one, implies some deeper motive in Rush than the

pseudo-patriotism so conspicuous in the letters. Fortunately, an explanation

can be supplied, which may be taken for what it is worth. It was written by

John Armstrong,--the author of the "Newburg letters" of 1783 (calling on the

continental army to seize the government of the United States), and later

Secretary of War in Madison's administration,--in whose writings more

historical revelations concerning that period are to be found than in those of

almost any other man; the writer was an aid-de-camp of General Gates, too, and

a minor star in the cabal. Yet despite this reason for justifying all concerned

in the attempt to calumniate and remove Washington, in 1819 Armstrong wrote R.

Gilmor:--<p>



<p>



<p>



                                                    LE GRANGE, Monday. <p>



<p>



DEAR SIR,--I am much obliged by your note of Wednesday. Morgan was the

ostensible--Rush the real prosecutor of Shippen--the former acting from

revenge, (having been ejected from the office to make room for Shippen) the

latter from a desire to obtain the directorship. In approving the sentence of

the court, Washington stigmatized the prosecution as one originating in bad

motives, which made Rush his enemy and defamer as long as he lived....<p>



<p>



          With great respect<p>



<p>



                    Your obedient servant,<p>



<p>



                                   JOHN ARMSTRONG.<p>



<p>



MR. GILMORE.<p>



<p>



<p>



In closing, it may be of interest to add that there exists to-day in

Philadelphia a biography of Dr. Rush in his own handwriting, in which frequent

comparisons are drawn between himself and Washington, usually to the latter's

disadvantage. Unfortunately, the publication or sight of it is prohibited, or

still further light on this matter might be possible.

	<font size=5>W</font>ere you ever a member of a school board? If not, then have hardly been
revealed to you, in their fullest measure, the machinations and tendencies of
the dual forces that combine to establish our public schools: the educational
forces on the one hand, and the public or political forces on the other. To the
thoughtful board member are revealed the inherent weaknesses of the
public-school system as developed in America. To him are shown "the foibles and
fancies of the educationist, the heedlessness and pettiness of the more
thoughtless element in the constituency, and, alas! the limitations of the
teachers. And he is constantly comparing the ideal schools he supposed to exist
before he got his intimate insight, and the schools he really discovered after
his official relationship began. This disillusioning is distracting.<p>

<p>

Just at present there is a stirring about in the public-school world. Some mild
muckrakers have been busy with the rake, and are trying to find out "What is
the matter with our public schools;" and a few conscientious critics are
pointing out genuine weaknesses in the RESULTS of our public-school system.
This commotion comes almost like a shock, after a long lull which had put us to
sleep in the pedagogical cradle, bringing us pleasant dreams about the great
public-school system, the pride of the land, the glory of the nation and so
forth. For everybody was quite sure that these schools were the bulwark of our
freedom, and that they somehow were too sacred to be criticised. At the same
time, every one reserved the right to decided personal opinions about the way
these schools should be run. For there is no other public institution so
universally lauded in bulk, and so criticised in parvo, as the public-school
system.<p>

<p>

The results of the school system that are challenged in these newer indictments
may be brought under three groups.<p>

<p>

First, we are told that the pupil does not gain real knowledge. He studies
about things, in an indefinite sort of way, but never learns the solid facts.
The whole system, from the happy kindergarten to the mimic-college high school,
is permeated with the haze of indefiniteness. There is present only the mirage
of learning, not the substantial reality. The old-fashioned drilling has
vanished. The line upon line and precept upon precept method, that builds real
brain-substance, is replaced by pseudo-psychological "methods" taught in
"normal" schools. The result is, the pupil is not trained in exactness and
thoroughness.<p>

<p>

Secondly, we are told that the pupil does not even learn to use his mind.
Schoolmasters give as an excuse for the lack of exactness in their pupils, that
the boys and girls have learned how to use their mental equipment even though
they do not know very many facts. But here is a substantial arraignment of this
supposed result of modern school methods. The school is an enslaver of memory
instead of an emancipator of reasoning. Originality is tabooed, and servility
demanded. The curse of the lawyer, the search for precedent, is written on the
brow of pedagogy. Logic and reason are not encouraged.<p>

<p>

And, thirdly, the results of our schools are not practical. This is heard on
every hand. The schools do not fit for bread-and-butter earning, they rather
make a boy or girl unfit for the hard tasks of life.<p>

<p>

A fourth count in the indictment is sometimes added by the moralist, who claims
that the moral traits of the child are hardly awakened, and that the boys and
girls, especially those who break the ranks before the eighth grade is reached,
are entirely unfit to meet the severe demands that the temptations of life make
upon them.<p>

<p>

These, briefly, are the charges. They may be summed up by saying that, in a
very general and unsatisfactory way, the schools teach the elements of mental
processes: that they, to this extent only, teach morals; and that they leave
the aptitudes, manual and mental, in about as dormant a condition as they found
them in.<p>

<p>

These charges are made against the RESULTS of our public education. But these
results are the outgrowth of CONDITIONS. I do not wish here to discuss the
indictment, I wish only to describe frankly some of the conditions that prevail
in our public schools, from which these undesirable consequences have grown.
These plain facts I present, as they were unfolded to me while serving on the
Board of Education in one of our large cities, where conditions are perhaps a
little above the average.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>I.</font></b><p>

<p>

And I begin with the teacher. For the teacher is the school. And in considering
the teacher we must begin with the superintendent. The position of
superintendent of schools is unique and anomalous. It demands the learning of a
college president, the consecration of a clergyman, the wisdom of a judge, the
executive talent of a financier, the patience of a church janitor, the humility
of a deacon, and the craftiness of a politician. The position demands that the
superintendent manage the schools purely as an educational investment for the
public, without being in any degree influenced by the passions and impulses of
the public. It is because of these requirements, which would tax genius and
divinity, that there are so few real superintendents. If you should attend a
meeting of the National Association of Superintendents, for the purpose of
seeking one for your home town, you would be depressed by the scarcity of
first-class material for so important a place. You would learn, on inquiry,
that most of these men drifted into the superintendency,-- they just happened
into the job. Some were educated for the ministry, some for the bar, some for
medicine, a few had been in business, all of them had been teachers, but only a
small minority had started out in life by choosing the regal following of
educational leader as a profession, and had persisted in their laudable
ambition with courage and perseverance. Until very recently, there was no
college or university that paid any attention to school administration in its
curriculum. Those great centres of learning to which the nation rightly looks
for educational guidance were blind to the great needs of the common schools;
so that a man, ambitious to become a successful superintendent of schools, had
to pick his own way, prepared by experience and inclination but not by
scientific guide. The result was perfectly natural. The making of
superintendents was left to chance, and to those interested forces which
contrived to gain the mastery of the situation. Some superintendents were thus
made by party politics, some by certain commercial interests, some by coteries
of teachers or cliques of busybodies, and some, we may be very sure, by a happy
and conscientious choice. These last have been, fortunately, the propulsive
force in American public education, and the nation owes a large debt of
gratitude to the great pioneer superintendents, who rose above the
circumstances of their appointments and gave conscience and professional
prowess to their tasks.<p>

<p>

Happily there is now growing up in our country a group of young men who have
definitely chosen educational administrative work as their profession who have
been trained for their calling in colleges that have recognized their special
needs, and who, it is hoped will prove strong enough to withstand the
temptations that are peculiar to public office. But ideal professional guidance
in public school affairs will not be possible until some of the conditions
surrounding the office of Superintendent are changed. The office must be
entirely separated from the haphazard of politics. Formerly the superintendent
was elected in many states by the people on party tickets. One of our large
cities even today clings to this barbarous custom to its shame and the great
detriment of its school system. At present it is almost the universal custom to
elect the superintendent through the board of education. Even under this
practice he is still made to feel the insecurity of his tenure. For the board
members are elected, and through them the people can strike at the
superintendent. Every city is prone to have a superintendent war about every
ten or twenty years. A man who has to direct so many teachers, placate so many
parents and come in practical contact with the public every day will make
enemies, especially if he is a robust and enterprising man. And these enemies
will seek revenge at the polls. So, in order to raise a generation of
professional superintendents it will not be enough to have them trained in the
technique of their profession. The tenure of office must be made long enough
and secure enough from interference by either the board or the public to
attract scholarly men.<p>

<p>

While there has been so much of chance in the making of the superintendent,
there has been a more earnest attempt made in the training of teachers although
even our normal schools are of comparatively recent origin. School-teaching is
even now scarcely a profession. People still think that almost any one can be a
teacher. In truth, any one who can pass the required examinations and get a
certificate is legally qualified to teach. These requirements are usually so
low that a graduate of an ordinary high school can pass them. Indeed our cities
maintain normal schools that are filled with girls taken green from the high
school who are given two years of seasoning in method and are then turned back
into the public schools whence they came. This perpetual stream wends its
never-varying circuit annually swelled only occasionally by the addition of a
few women or men who have had a college education.<p>

<p>

This kind of hurry-up training emphasizes method not character; memory, not
logic. It tends to make education mechanical, impersonal. It leads the youthful
pedagogue to teach arithmetic and reading, when she should be told to teach
Johnny and Mary. For education that is not individual, that does not respond
hopefully and joyously to the magic of personal association, results in mental
palsy. Our meagre starveling way of preparing teachers degrades the schools and
the profession. The basis of teaching must be knowledge, and how shall they
teach if they have not knowledge? The inspiration of teaching must be
personality, but how shall they inspire if they have no soul for their work?<p>

<p>

Moreover, this factory method of making teachers inclines to shrivel them. The
exactions of their daily tasks, goodness knows, are severe enough to deaden
their wider instincts. The stronger reason why their preliminary training
should be of the greatest diameter. The natural propensities of all human
beings are easily influenced by their vocations. Perhaps this is why some
teachers are so apt to be narrow and unsympathetic toward persons and events
that lie beyond the pale of their immediate work. There must be a broad
sympathetic spirit at the basis of every profession; and it is this spirit that
marks the subtle distinction between a calling and a business--a distinction
that is important and potent.<p>

<p>

Of course, the vast majority of public-school-teachers are women. Probably this
will always be true, though more men are surely needed. Thirty years ago it was
almost the only occupation a woman could enter. To-day the call of many
occupations reaches her ear. The result is that many of the ablest and most
robust women who must work, avoid teaching, and the ranks of the public-school
teachers must suffer from this loss.<p>

<p>

The state has certainly not done its part to glorify the profession of
teaching. It has not lured talent, either by offering preparatory schools equal
to those of the other professions, or by offering adequate pay. Our school
resources are too small on all sides. The maximum tax levy for school purposes
is usually fixed by state law, and the harassed school board is continually
confronted by the task of doling out the resources at hand among teachers, and
buildings, and supplies, and playgrounds, and free lectures, and a hundred
other things that call for money. They are, as a rule, as generous with the
teachers as the state permits them to be. On the other hand, better pay should
be contingent upon a broader preparation, more effective service, a more
genuine spirit of helpfulness, less petty self-seeking, and a more liberal
outlook on life. Money alone cannot create a profession.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>II.</font></b><p>

<p>

Out of such educational conditions has come the course of study. What shall
these teachers teach? This seems to be a universal enigma. The question was not
asked seventy years ago. The itinerant schoolmaster, boarding round, and
gathering his flock from the scattered huts of the pioneers, taught reading
writing and arithmetic. And the refulgent halo of the three R's rests above the
traditions of these early district schools. With a little history, geography,
and spelling added, this remained the course of study until some educator
suddenly awoke to the fact that, while science was eagerly and rapidly
enlarging the domain of human knowledge, while human ingenuity was binding the
continents into unity, and civilization was moving forward with swift strides,
the course of study had remained quite stationary. So the prop of "enriching"
began. But alas! the enriching proceeded from books and theories, to the
exclusion of the vital needs of the state. So much frosting has been put on the
loaf, and so many raisins put within, that very little of the nourishing
substance is left.<p>

<p>

This course of study, being built by educators who have studied books rather
than civilization, is bookish. Its creators being theorists rather than
empiricists, it is transcendental. And the cry of an awakening nation is, "Back
to the fundamentals. Make education practical. This is the extreme reaction on
the part of the people from the extreme attempt on the part of educators to
embellish the curriculum. The impulsive public, electing its school board,
demands a "practical education," but fails to define what constitutes a
practical education. So with the swaying pendulum we are bound to have either
Day-Dreamer or Gradgrind.<p>

<p>

Thus far we have been told not to meddle with the course of study. We the
laymen, must keep our hands off and let the professional educator arrange the
schedules. And as a result every fad and fancy has been given a place, until
the printed course of study resembles the menu card of a metropolitan
restaurant. Modernly, every teacher has her psychologists and the beautiful
science of child-study has been wounded and torn by thousands of clumsy,
awkward amateurs, whose addenda to this "course" of study make the schools
ridiculous to earnest, sensible men. These varied and all-embracing programmes
of study presuppose every Tommy and Mary Ann to be a modern Lotze, capable of
greater feats of genius than constructing, or even comprehending, a
Microcosmos. <p>

<p>

Of course it is all dealt out in homeopathic doses. There are pellets of
anatomy and physiology, of painting and drawing, of psychology and philosophy,
of a little arithmetic and a little grammar. All the pellets are sugar-coated,
for the whole pedagogical theory seems to command that the teacher make all
these things easy for the pupil. So we have all kinds of patent devices for
making the child's pathway one of velvet. There are wonderful new text-books
that have all the lessons analyzed and classified, leaving very little for
exertion. There are charts, multi-colored, that simplify the lessons, and
pictures and cabinets that illustrate the charts. Everything is put in the
pupils' hands. Genuine effort seems to be discouraged.<p>

<p>

The vicious, immoral thing about all this is, that it enacts a great and
terrible lie to the child. He is made to believe that superficiality is a
substitute for thoroughness, and that effort is superfluous as well as
unpleasant. And what is even more cruel, he is entirely unprepared for the
school of life, where no teacher and no text are at his side to resolve his
tasks from work into play.<p>

<p>

And this hodge-podge of "essentials" and "enrichments" the teacher is told to
dole out by "method." And mere method, technical routine, is the deadly enemy
of individual work. And individual development is the supreme function of human
life. Society could endure the crazy patchwork of an enriched course of study,
and the stern competition of life teach the youth the lessons of perseverance
and application; but society cannot long endure the suppression of personality.
Our machine-made teachers are, by machine methods, making of our splendid boys
and girls, each one stamped with the divinity of individuality, mere
machines.<p>

<p>

Now that the educator has had his day in telling us what to teach and how to
teach it, the taxpayer is beginning to teach the pedagogue. He approaches the
question from the bread-and-butter side. He leaves the basic studies in the
course, follows the child into the world, and asks for RESULTS. The danger from
this is apparent.<p>

<p>

In the technique of the course of study, America is just beginning to learn
from Germany the lesson of differentiation. Heretofore we have crammed
everything into one building, and into one course of study. For instance, the
city high school, the offspring of the old academy, has had tacked on to it
some work in manual training and also some few commercial studies. The product
is a hybrid, neither a technical school, nor a commercial school, nor a
classical school. The time has now come for separating the diverse organs, and
developing their functions. Technical and commercial high schools, fully
equipped and doing a splendid work, are now found in our most advanced
cities.<p>

<p>

Of the grades the same is true. The trade-school is coming into vogue rapidly.
It has come to stay. But not as an adjunct to the present grade schools. It
will be an entity by itself. As our country fills up, this differentiation will
increase. It must become our national economic salvation.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>III.</font></b><p>

<p>

These American schools are public schools. This lends to them at once their
greatest significance, their greatest power, and their greatest handicap: is at
once the source of their wonderful strength and their gravest weakness. The
handicaps mentioned above are technical, and to a great extent can be remedied;
probably in the course of fifty years they will be. But when shall the foibles
of the people be consumed, and when their impulsiveness tamed? The schools
belong to everybody, and everybody wants to keep his spoon in the educational
porridge, and stir, and stir, and stir.<p>

<p>

Of the hampering and intermeddling public, the most excusable portion is the
unreasonable parent. Parents who may be reasonable about all their neighbors
and about all other subjects, are not unlikely to become impatient and
unreasonable about school matters that pertain to their own children. It
becomes a question of my Charlie versus your Charlie. Of course the variety of
subjects that appeal to the unreason of such people is limitless. It may be a
matter of discipline, or of transfer, or of personal pique against the teacher,
or any one of a thousand different trivialities. But this particular species of
parent immediately magnifies it into an astounding greatness, and usually makes
a neighborhood issue of it. This may merely be annoying; always it is
irritating; and sometimes, unfortunately, it becomes inflaming. Then it leads
to written charges, to court-martial by the superintendent, star-chamber
sessions by the board, lawsuits in the courts, and to political issues at the
polls. Superintendents have been ousted, principals discharged, teachers'
hearts broken, by these unreasonable meddlers. Such instances will recur, in
various guises, to the reader. One fractious parent can upset an entire
neighborhood, and dispel that beautiful spirit of cooperation between the home
and the school that forms the real potency of education.<p>

<p>

When this unreasonable ire is poured out upon a board member, its results are
far less deplorable, for he is not as essential to the welfare of the schools,
and has weapons at his command. While his life is made a burden by all kinds of
busybodies, he yet has the imperial privilege of talking back.<p>

<p>

Then there are many groups or special interests which try to use the schools to
further their enterprises or prejudices. Among these the party politician may
be placed first. Happily he is a vanishing factor in school elections and
administration. The boards are in some states still nominated by party
machinery, and placed on party tickets, but the Australian ballot and
nomination by petition are being widely adopted for the school ticket. This
removes the board from party politics so far as such a thing is possible. But
the party spoilsman, in some cities, still looks upon school janitors and
employees as legitimate party spoils. And he even ventures to call on the
superintendent and board members to suggest appointments for the teachers'
roll, or to further the promotion of some teacher who may be related to an
influential citizen, not infrequently accompanying his "request" with a mild
threat. It is to the interest of the partisan, of course, that members are
elected to the board whom he can use. Such men are ordinarily unfit for
administering school affairs. It is an axiom that the usefulness to a community
of a board-member increases directly as his political partisanship decreases.
No doubt a purely political school board, particularly a board, has been one of
the great curses of our public schools. But they are almost a thing of the
past, and with their departure will vanish the attempts to use schools for
purely partisan ends.<p>

<p>

Of course, there is "politics" in everything,--in church, in business, wherever
a group of men and women are contending for place and power. This instinct for
playing the game of human nature is strongly developed in Americans, and forms
the motive of our remarkable organizations, and all our public institutions are
peculiarly subject to these influences. This spirit lends itself very readily
to trivial transactions. Old-time politics are not nearly so destructive to
school efficiency as are the petty "peanut" politics called forth by
grievances, by revenge, by commercial cupidity, and a score of other petty
potencies. Take, for instance, the question of retiring a superannuated
teacher. Even in cities that provide a pension fund, this is a most delicate
and hazardous undertaking for superintendent and board. If the teacher of sixty
or seventy years does not wish to retire gracefully and peacefully, she calls
upon her hundreds of former pupils, many of them now leading business and
professional men, she calls on the city editor of the daily papers, on her
minister, her doctor, and her lawyer, on the members of her lodge and her
church, and together they march in motley array, with grim energy, upon the
school officials, more determined than crusaders, and, quite convinced that the
welfare of the world is hanging on the outcome of their fight. If the school
authorities yield, discipline goes wild. If they persist, the crowd threatens
and plays politics when the term of the superintendent or board expires. And it
is surprising what a fine class of citizens can be enlisted in these grievance
campaigns. Men and women who surely ought to know better, who are expected to
be self-possessed, allow themselves to be carried to ridiculous extremes over
such matters.<p>

<p>

Likewise the dismissal of incompetent teachers is made almost impossible in
some communities by such over-zealous delirium on the part of good people.
Sometimes lodges, business organizations, and even churches, are used as
cudgels over the heads of the miserable school authorities. I have known a
sewing society in a certain church in a small town to champion an unworthy
superintendent and lead the fight to the polls, and, by virtue of the anomalous
law that gives women the franchise in school questions, carry on a campaign of
gossip and win an election.<p>

<p>

In most of our cities there is a prevalent, provincial feeling that looks with
disdain and disfavor upon the hiring of teachers from other towns. This
sentiment makes of our schools semi-eelymosynary institutions, whose principal
function is to give employment to the daughters and sons of the place. The bane
of this in-and-in breeding is felt in every large city. So acute is the feeling
that, if the superintendent goes abroad for a few alien teachers, he is decried
as disloyal, and he is fortunate if the disgruntled ones fail in organizing a
foolish opposition to his well-meant endeavor to infuse new life into his
schools. There are instances on record where a determined parent has set out to
elect a school board so that her daughter might be appointed a teacher, though
she was lacking both in spirit and knowledge. "I have lived here thirty years
and paid taxes, and the city owes it to me to employ my daughter rather than
hire some one from out of town who never helped make this city," said an irate
parent to me, after I had told him I could not interfere with the appointing of
teachers by the superintendent. And this feeling is quite as prevalent as it is
hurtful to the schools.<p>

<p>

Another form of school politics found in every city emanates from those
commercial interests which find it profitable to be able to control school
administration. While I believe the methods of book companies and supply houses
have been very greatly improved in the last twenty years, it still remains true
that some of their methods are inscrutable, and their attempt at interference
with the selection of school boards and superintendents is not conducive to the
best educational results. The popular estimate of the amount and manner of this
interference is vastly and grotesquely exaggerated; but the involved interests
have only themselves to blame for this. Their competition often lacks that fair
and broadminded spirit that is usually found among business men, while any
unwarranted attempts to control school elections and appointments are hurtful
to the schools. Of course this can be said of any other public business.<p>

<p>

Still more unfortunate is it when a clique of teachers forms a cabal against
superiors for the purpose of furthering its own selfish interests. They succeed
at times in allying themselves with a faction in the board, and a reign of
terror follows their enthronement. Cheap pedagogical factionalism has crippled
many a school system. Only heroic remedies help such a pathological
condition.<p>

<p>

The result of all this agitation and potboiling is increased manifold by the
attitude of the sensational newspapers. Such papers find meat in quarrels, and
are always tempted to distort the truth into a misshapen thing. Fortunately
such newspapers are rare. Even the wildest among them profess a crocodile
interest in the children of the schools and the teachers. But even the best and
most conservative newspapers often do an irreparable injury to the educational
work of the schools by giving voice to the silly discontent and personal
vindictiveness of the disgruntled. Thus they awaken the distrust of the people
and lead to a loss of confidence, based on no adequate reason, that undermine
the work of conservative educators; The carping, fault-finding newspaper, that
never permits a cheerful, helpful adjective to escape its fonts, that is
pessimistic by policy, always hinting at things sinister, and saying that
thus-and-so affirms that this and that should have been done as it was not
done, and that so-and-so would have been better if this or that had not
happened, and so forth,--this newspaper is infinitely worse in its influence on
the schools than the senseless busybody and self-seeking meddler.<p>

<p>

It is always easier for a sore-head to get a big headline in the dailies than
for the constructive conservative; and unfortunately for society, human nature
is always more willing to listen to calumny than to praise, and to lend its
strength to tearing down than to building up.<p>

<p>

The consequence of all this multiformed political activity is, that turmoil
unseats tranquillity, dark discontent stalks by the side of cheerful
helpfulness, distrust dispels hope, and uneasiness and restlessness are felt
everywhere in the schools. All these disgruntled forces, by working in unison,
can usually elect at least one member to a board of education. Lucky is the
city where it is not a majority. This member is the grievance member. He, or
she, becomes the repository of all secret complaints. Dissatisfied teachers or
parents or neighbors pour out their imaginings into his or her lap. Reporters,
hard pressed for stuff, ply him or her with ingenious questions. The public is
fed on a diet of "suppose" and "they say," while the poor schools are a-quiver,
wondering what will happen next.<p>

<p>

If these disgruntled ones succeed in carrying an election, and with it a
majority of the board, then the voice of the sovereign people must of course be
obeyed. Whatever was the issue, usually kept in reserve during the campaign, it
must be dragged out and the will of the people vindicated--sometimes by
breaking the heart of a fine and cultured teacher; sometimes by discharging a
superintendent of independence and courage who refuses to do the bidding of the
unreasonable board, and dares to stand between people and their enemies;
sometime ripping up a course of study, or by dismissing a business manager, or
by reinstating a delinquent official. Whatever the original grievance, by the
time election is over it has grown, like a fast-rolling snowball, and the
avalanche is rushing on its destructive course.<p>

<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>IV.</font></b><p>

<p>

In spite of these volatile, irresponsible, disgruntled elements; in the teeth
of agitation about what to teach and how to teach it, and how to build and
where to build; against restlessness and suspiciousness on the part of teachers
and patrons, our free schools have vindicated the great wisdom of their
founders. At heart everybody believes in them, and they are among our most
cherished public possessions. We must not be blind to the handicaps that so
universally beset them.<p>

<p>

Before they can approach the idealized usefulness that so often is pictured of
them, they must be placed under purely professional control, out of the reach
of the mere agitator, the headless and heedless costermonger of educational
panaceas, and the unreason of the multitude. Moreover, there must be a saner
popular participation, finding expression in much more generous tax levies, and
the election of the wisest and sanest men the community to membership on the
governing board. There must come a greater public interest in the educational
work of the school. Some method will be devised, whereby the public will be
enabled to infuse some of its energy and practicalness into the school work.
The dividing of the city into small districts and appointing a committee of
visitors from each district, whose duty it is to visit the schools, and suggest
to the board of education and the superintendent such changes as they deem
wise, has produced good results in German cities. And there must certainly be
more educational aggressiveness on the part of the pedagogue, more response to
the actual needs of life, both cultural and vocational.<p>

<p>

It appears that the public-school educator needs tranquillity, freedom, and
enterprise. He needs tranquillity, because the development of his science
requires the repose of the study. The rude jolting of suspicion, jealousy,
vindictiveness, and bigotry are fatal to the growth of a sane pedagogical
science.<p>

<p>

He needs freedom, for an institution dependent upon the political vicissitudes
of the day cannot be stable and well poised.<p>

<p>

And, above all, he needs enterprise, the enterprise to match his schools with
our civilization.<p>

<p>

Maybe, if there were more genuine enterprise, not the make-believe, bustling
kind, among the educators, there would be a great deal less carping and
parsimoniousness on the part of the people. Maybe the public would hail with
great joy and cooperation such an energizing of the schools. Maybe it is too
much to hope that this tranquillity, freedom, and enterprise shall ever abide
in the schools that belong to an impulsive public which often seems to prefer a
self-complacent mediocrity to a virile efficiency.

you find, with a difference only in power and nerve, the same sort of person


who gave the world its Five-Year Plans and Great Leaps Forward--the Soviet and


Chinese counterparts."<p>





The person who wrote that, in a book published last year, sees no essential


difference between the democratically elected governments led by Franklin D.


Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy and the dictatorships of Joseph Stalin and Mao


Zedong. Not one reader in 10,000 could guess the author's name, though it is


easy to conclude that he is a political imbecile. Who else could believe such


nonsense? The majority leader of the House of Representatives, that's who: the


redoubtable <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/armey/">Dick Armey</A>. That Armey holds a Ph.D. says more about the state of


American education than all the headline-grabbing studies about teenagers who


can't place the Civil War in the right half century. The kids are only dumb


pending knowledge; Armey is ignorant by ideology. But let E. J. Dionne take it


from here: <p>





<blockquote>This sort of thinking is now so common that it has been forgotten how radically


different it is from the tradition on which the United States was founded--a


tradition to which contemporary liberals, moderates, conservatives and


libertarians all trace their roots. . . . Free government is different in


<i>kind</i> from despotic regimes because its fundamental


 purpose--to vindicate the rights of individuals--is different.</blockquote>


  


His citation from a book published to continental indifference and his superbly


decisive gloss are typical of Dionne's evidentiary resources and intellectual


weight. His <i>Why Americans Hate Politics </i>was by leagues <i>the</i>


political book of 1992, cited in news reports, editorials, and columns, and


frequently by candidate Bill Clinton, who used Dionne's analysis of how both


parties were dominated by ideology-besotted elites to argue for a "third way"


of governing between alternatives he called "brain-dead." Parenthetically,


something that used to be encouraging about Clinton--his appetite for books--is


less so now that he is First Reader and we can see his openness to ideas as an


aspect of his unfinished political identity. At all events, <i>They Only


</i>Look<i> Dead</i> deserves to be to 1996 what <i>Why Americans Hate


Politics</i> was to 1992, not only for its intrinsic qualities but also for the


good news announced in its subtitle. <p>





<IMG SRC="./Books.GIF" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="167" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10">





That news is good not just for "Progressives" but also for that much larger


group of Americans whom Secretary of Labor <A HREF="http://www.npr.gov/NPR_AnnualRep/Bios/reich.html">Robert B. Reich</A> has called "the


anxious class"--the sinking middle class, whose real wages have been frozen or


falling since the late 1970s. The anxious class elected Bill Clinton in 1992


and then, frustrated by what Dionne calls the "dysfunctional" Democrats, helped


to make Armey, Gingrich &amp; Co. the new congressional majority in 1994. <p>





Whether the majority will hold is another question. As Dionne makes clear, the


"radicalized conservatism" of the new Republicans has nothing to say to the


anxious class except, Work harder and lobby for the return of child labor. The


Armey-Gingrich view of virtually any act of government as incipient


tyranny--FDR as Stalin, JFK as Mao--rules out help from Washington in making


the transition to the new world economy. This leaves the social fate of the


anxious class up to the market, which to the Republicans is the sphere of


freedom, much as government is the sphere of coercion. But the market,


specifically the new world economy and the technological revolution, created


the anxious class in the first place. Thus, in the face of the country's


overriding problem, the Republican Party is in principled bankruptcy. <p>





That is why Dionne predicts a revival of progressivism--the faith of


turn-of-the-century Progressives and their New Deal legatees in the ability of


government to expand freedom (think of the GI Bill of Rights) by hindering the


hindrances of birth or environment or historical moment which otherwise tend to


restrict economic opportunity to the few. "By moving American conservatism


toward a rendezvous with nineteenth century laissez-faire doctrines," Dionne


writes, "Gingrich and his allies will force their opponents to grapple with the


task of constructing the twenty-first-century alternatives to laissez-faire."<p>





"Their opponents" means the Democrats, and Dionne devotes much of his book to


the Democrats' still-ramifying failures of intellect, nerve, memory, and


political imagination. In his first chapter, "Why Politicians Don't Get Respect


Anymore," he shrewdly suggests that the Democrats' fellow-traveling with the


anti-government rhetoric of the 1970s and 1980s left them nothing to argue


about with Republicans. The "politics of moral annihilation"--the attack ads,


the scandal-mongering, the personal vilification, that have driven public faith


in politics and government to toxic depths--filled the philosophical void.


Dionne rightly says that "the overall impact of the foul atmosphere . . . is


[to favor] the anti-government right, because the most obvious target of the


public's anger (as the Republicans demonstrated in 1994) is the government."


Thus the Democrats, by leaving the field of principled argument to the


Republicans and by failing to defend their progressive tradition ("their main


reason for existence"), robbed that tradition of legitimacy and left


uncontested the public impression that government is theft.<p>





"In this climate," Dionne observes, "it's easier to convince voters that your


opponent will hurt them than that you will somehow help them." This appears to


be the Democrats' strategy in this year's congressional races: morph your


opponent into a clone of the immensely unpopular Gingrich and engage in


"Mediscare" over Republican "cuts" in Medicare. It is easier to go negative


than to meet the new Republican Party in open debate over, for example,


progressive alternatives to the Republican surrender of Medicare to for-profit


HMOs and big insurance companies--a surrender that an American Academy of


Actuaries study predicts could both drive up the cost of traditional Medicare


and make doctors even more unwilling to treat Medicare patients.<p>


<pre>





</pre>





 <font size=5>D</font>IONNE sees today's politicians as "adrift" in a sea of crises they are either


unable to address (Republicans) or unwilling to address honestly (Democrats).


"The Four Crises of American Politics" form the substance of Dionne's important


second chapter. These are: <p>





* The economic crisis made by the new world economy, which "seems to break the


link between the success of the affluent and the well-being of everyone else"


--notably the growing segment of the anxious class that lines up every morning


in "'the global hiring hall,'" in the words of the labor analyst Richard


Rothstein, where wage levels are driven down by the desperate masses of the


Third World.<p>





* The political crisis created by the economic crisis. Voters still hold


government responsible for the economy, but government has never had less


control over what is no longer a national economy but is a world one. "For


politicians in the democratic countries, this marriage of ever-higher levels of


accountability with less actual power is a nightmare."<p>





* A moral crisis manifesting itself in historically unprecedented rates of


divorce, family breakup, and illegitimacy.<p>





* A crisis of purpose over America's post-Cold War role in the world, which was


exposed in the debates over Clinton's interventions in Haiti and Bosnia.<p>





Dionne skillfully links the first three crises, but his synthetic gifts desert


him in his discussion of the fourth, which he treats mainly as an


inside-the-Beltway dustup among elites, when more is at stake. Dionne, a


columnist for <i>The Washington Post</i>, is too much a man of the Washington


establishment to confront basic questions of national strategy in an era when


both parties are pledged to balance the budget--questions like Why should U.S.


taxpayers forgo social investments, as Dionne calls for in order to help solve


the economic crisis created by the new world economy, so that we can defend


Europe against . . . well, whom? His establishment world view creeps into his


discussion of Clinton's foreign policy. Thus he says, "Toward Russia [Clinton]


pursued a consistent policy of general sympathy for Boris Yeltsin and sought to


avoid moves that might strengthen nationalist feeling in Russia." Though


criticized as too soft on Yeltsin, "the policy did seem to prevent the worst


from happening." The assumption is that Clinton's words were or could be causal


as to events in Russia. That is the kind of pre-Copernican thinking that few


still question in Washington and that has led to grand expectations about "the


U.S. role in the world," which in turn have led to national hubris,


disillusionment, and distraction. Even Bill Clinton, after defeating the


"foreign-policy President" on a platform of domestic renewal, has fallen back


on foreign policy to display strength. Why can't he display strength over


raising American wages? One reason is the Washington foreign-policy


establishment's grip on the engines of respectability and its monopoly on the


vocabulary of seriousness.<p>


<pre>





</pre>





<font size=5>I</font>T was said in criticism of John Galsworthy that his <i>Forsyte Saga</i> was


read by every Forsyte in England. Something comparable might be said of


Dionne's account of the Clinton Administration. There is little in his


emollient pages to deter the First Reader from repeating his recent performance


with Ben Wattenberg, whose book <i>Values Matter Most</i> was critical of


Clinton, and telephoning Dionne full of praise and rueful agreement with what


are less criticisms than extenuations. Dionne includes stimulating chapters on


the elections of 1992 and 1994, on the ideological hardening of the post-1992


Republican Party, on the role the press has played in the political crisis, and


on the cyber-Darwinian vision of Newt Gingrich, who beneath his Fourth Wave


blather is truly a man of '96--1896, that is, to which year of untrammeled


rapacity he wants to return the country, limiting the government's power in


relation to transnational corporate interests to what it was before Lyndon


Johnson, John Kennedy, Harry Truman, Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and


Theodore Roosevelt. But Dionne's appraisal of Clinton, because it is so smart


and sensible and because Dionne's reputation precedes it, will have great


currency among political journalists as they assess the Clinton record in the


election campaign. For that reason it merits a critical look. <p>





The context made him do it--such at bottom is Dionne's defense of Clinton.


Reasonable, fair-minded, informed, and insightful, Dionne's case is hard to


upend. Yet those who come to his book hoping that Dionne will express some of


their disappointment in Clinton will be disappointed. <p>





Administration spokespeople cite low unemployment, low interest rates, and the


extremely low inflation rate that reflects flattened wages as evidence of the


success of Clinton's economic policies. But, as Dionne points out, Clinton ran


against Bush not just on the arithmetic of yesterday's politics but also on


sinking wages and living standards. Dionne says that Clinton's inability to


deliver in this harder coin--neither wages nor living standards have budged


under his Administration--"arose in significant part because the problems were


far more easily described than resolved." True. But, as we will see, he verges


on being <i>too</i> fair to Clinton, who is only the most powerful man in the


world.<p>





Was Clinton unable to fund the robust worker-retraining programs advocated by


Robert Reich in these pages in the 1980s? "It cannot be stressed enough how


much the budget deficit he inherited from the Reagan-Bush years impeded his


ability to govern." Did Clinton as President lose the clarity of vision he


displayed as a candidate about the country's big problems? "If Clinton often


seemed indecisive, that was, in part, because almost any decision he made


carried substantial political risks." Did Clinton succeed in his goal of


rehabilitating "the welfare state" in the eyes of middle-class voters who


favored a generous version of welfare reform as long as it vindicated work?


"Clinton's approach to this problem was more complex than is usually allowed."


<p>





Since polls showed strong public support for universal coverage throughout the


1994 debate over health care, why didn't Clinton at least demand a vote on his


program, which alone of the alternatives had universality at its heart? "It was


a large irony: A program designed to reduce public mistrust of government fell


victim to that very mistrust." And why were welfare reform and health-care


reform and campaign-finance reform delayed until 1994, when the Republicans


were in full wrecking mode, when Clinton had campaigned on these issues in


1992? "President Clinton had a hellish time winning enactment of his 1993


budget because Democrats were divided on both the fundamental issues it raised


and the niggling particulars it involved." <p>





By rejecting Paul Tsongas in the primaries, Democrats rejected his argument


that the budget deficit was the country's major problem. By electing Bill


Clinton, who ranked deficit reduction much lower in his campaign than either


George Bush or Ross Perot, the general electorate seemed to agree. So why did


Clinton spill all that costly blood in 1993 over a deficit-reduction budget?


"Clinton's appointees <nobr> . . . insisted that much of what had been said in the


campaign had to go. . . ." </nobr><p>





The context--the times, the inherent difficulties, the party divisions, the


economic advisers--made him do it. But Clinton appointed the advisers. He


tolerated the party divisions. He seemed paralyzed by the difficulties. He let


the times shape him rather than trying to shape them. Specifically, he failed


to pry Tom Foley and Richard Gephardt away from the ideologically suicidal


reliance of the Democratic Congress on special-interest money to finance its


empty "politics of incumbency." Instead of holding a Little Rock-style summit


on health care, with experts testifying on TV about the pros and cons involved


in the several reform plans, Clinton let his wife prepare her justifiably


complex plan behind closed doors, so that when finally made public it was an


opaque lump. Because they had not been vetted in open discussion, the carefully


calibrated tradeoffs looked arbitrary. Since the logic of health-care reform


had not been explained, opponents did not have to couch their criticisms in


terms of that logic. The policy-wonk culture of liberalism showed its fatal


political witlessness. Clinton permitted welfare reform to slip off the agenda


so as not to offend party liberals, whose help he needed to pass his


health-care bill, which was delayed by Hillary Clinton's wonks. When he finally


announced the health-care plan, the most sweeping social program since Social


Security, he let "Harry and Louise" have the last word on the substance. Then,


instead of taking the issue of "health care that's always there"--which


directly addresses one of the main fears of the anxious class --to the country,


he let the Republicans nationalize the midterm elections around their


back-to-McKinley contract.<p>





To put Clinton's failures as President into perspective, it helps to recall a


distinction FDR made between "low politics" and "high politics." Clinton cannot


get enough of low politics. He perfected "the permanent campaign" in his


Arkansas years, and he is never more himself than when electioneering. Polls,


focus groups, advisers, mercenary purveyors of spin (from James Carville to


David Gergen to Dick Morris)--sometimes Clinton disappears behind the costly


machinery of manipulation. But he has not really tried high politics in the FDR


sense--politics as public education, as frank explanatory talk about the


challenges facing the country. It is as if he has forgotten how he got to the


White House: by talking, explaining, connecting the dots of public discontent


into a plausible politics of remedy. To do this, of course, he would have to


stand up as President for the Progressive faith in government as an agent of


freedom and for an economics that, er, put people first. This would make


Clinton enemies among the kind of people who go to his beloved Renaissance


Weekends at Hilton Head. The engines of respectability would roar in protest.


The bond market would signal its displeasure, and the soft-money contributions


from Wall Street would dry up. <p>





Alluding to <A 


HREF="http://rpinfo.its.rpi.edu/dept/environ/guide/treaty.html">NAFTA and 


GATT</a> as well as the 1993 budget, Dionne writes of


Clinton, "His largest achievements--free trade and deficit reduction--were, at


bottom, <i>conservative </i>achievements. Yet they were conservative


achievements that won him no political payoff among conservative


constituencies." Had George Bush been re-elected, these would also have been


his main achievements. Running against the vision-challenged Bob ("I feel


<i>my</i> pain") Dole, Clinton seems at this writing likely to be re-elected.


Will he run on Mediscare, Newt, foreign policy, and promiscuous empathy, or


will he recover the Progressive voice he sounded in 1992? Will wages, living


standards, health care, welfare and political reform--the unfinished agenda of


Clinton I--furnish the agenda of Clinton II? The danger for Americans of the


anxious class is that Clinton will beat Dole with Dick Morris's "upscale


strategy," detaching natural-fiber Republicans from their polyester brethren


among the religious right, and then govern with one eye fixed on the dubious


laurel of going into history as the President who balanced the budget in the


term of his successor. That would kill Dionne's Progressive resurgence in its


crib, and the fall of the middle class would continue unabated, driving


American politics to a dangerous place.

OR many Americans, the good news in 1992 was that the country finally had

a feminist President. The bad news was that the President was a man. For many

others, Bill Clinton's Administration has, fairly or not, come to symbolize an

attack on men and masculinity as "problems"to be overcome. If 1992 was the

"Year of the Woman,"1994 brought the "Revolt of the Angry White Male." Suddenly

the question that has haunted American politics since women got the vote, in

1920--Will women vote differently from men, and how will that change politics

and public life generally?--had a new salience. The "gender gap"of the 1980s, a

phenomenon wrongly interpreted as favoring the Democrats, was yielding to a new

concept: gender realignment. <p>

Traditionally, American party politics has had fault lines--blacks vote

differently from whites and southerners from northerners. Even in the 1970s,

however, gender was not one of these. "Sex was a variable it never paid to look

at," Patrick Caddell, a leading Democratic pollster, once said. Men and women

tended to vote alike. <p>



Those days are now gone. In the 1994 midterm congressional elections men voted

Republican by a margin of 57 percent to 43 percent and women voted Democratic

54 percent to 46 percent for a gender gap of 22 points. Demographic breakdowns

within these groups tend to reveal even wider disparities: white men went

Republican in 1994 by 26 points, while unmarried women, white and nonwhite,

backed the Democrats by a 32-point margin.<p>



Along with the continuing shift of the once-solidly Democratic South to

Republican control, a related trend, the gravitation of men and women to

different political camps, appears to be the outstanding demographic

development in American politics over the past twenty years. "I think that

we're the party of Mars, but we would like to have the Venus side of the

American society in our party too," Trent Lott, a Republican senator from

Mississippi, said last year. With a gender split increasingly driving our

politics, many of the issues on the national agenda--from welfare to health

care to abortion--have been the bases for an indirect debate on the changing

roles of women and men. And the trend will continue. "I foresee a tremendous

clash around these issues continuing in the 1996 elections and beyond," says

Andrew Kohut, the director of the <A HREF="http://www.people-press.org/">Pew Research Center for the People and the

Press</A>. In a mid-spring <i>New York Times</i>/CBS News poll Bill Clinton was

running stronger among women against his Republican opponent than he did in

1992, but slightly worse among men.<p>



The press discovered the gender gap some fifteen years ago. Yet most

conventional accounts of the gap and its meaning continue to obscure the

importance of this realignment. First, although a difference in the way each

sex views political issues is nothing new, the emerging party-identification

gap between the sexes is unprecedented. Each party and its candidates now

appear to represent, at least in part, the interests of one sex against the

other. Thus the gap is responsible for much of the changing ideological

orientation of both parties--and the outcome of elections and the direction of

government policy. Second, although many media accounts still give the

impression that the gap is greatest on "women's issues" such as abortion and an

Equal Rights Amendment, men and women do not differ much on these issues.

Rather, the gulf today tends to be on issues involving the existence and

expansion of the social-welfare state.<p>



Far more women than men supported the Clinton health-care plan--not because its

architect was Hillary Clinton but because women are far less likely to be

covered by existing insurance plans (more of them work part-time). Women tend

to support affirmative action more than men, yet are much more in favor of

government spending to support social programs. In the cultural area women are

far more accepting of homosexuality than men, yet are also likelier to support

banning books that advocate positions they think are dangerous. (In a clash

between a real threat and an abstract ideal--say, the First Amendment--women

tend to worry about the real threat far more than men do.) Even the ways

politicians talk about issues affect the sexes differently. "Women have a much

lower tolerance for conflict," Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, says. "Take

the trade issue: Both parties kept making arguments for NAFTA by saying 'This

will increase competition.' But women don't like competition and they don't

respond to metaphors such as 'leveling the playing field.'" <p>



Certainly gap politics drives the current debate over welfare. The original

program, Aid to Dependent Children, was designed to support women so that they

could stay home and raise children--an ideal that has now changed. "Almost all

welfare states were built around the concept of a nuclear family, with a

wage-earning man," says Theda Skocpol, a sociologist and political scientist at

Harvard. As the norm changes, support for programs linked to it changes too. If

one sees the current welfare state as enabling women to be freer of men--and,

perhaps, more hostile to them--then dismantling that state may not seem like

such a terrible idea.<p>



Finally, most media accounts continue to describe the gap as helping the

Democrats, as mobilized women answer the call of feminism. In fact the opposite

has often been true, as men have turned out in strength to protect their

interests. Though the press frequently describes the gender gap as one

figure--say, 22 points in 1994--there are really two gaps: one among women

(equaling 8 points in 1994), benefiting the Democrats, and another among men

(14 points in 1994), which has recurrently benefited the Republicans more.

Maybe 1996 will be the year the gender gap finally benefits the Democrats. At

least until now, however, the "gendering" of American politics has sharply

eroded support for the social programs for which the Democrats have

traditionally stood. The two major political trends of the past fifteen

years--the rise of the gender gap and our political swing to the right--are

linked.<p>



Why have the political interests and voting behavior of many women and men

diverged in the past decade and a half? Is the divergence a good thing for our

society? And if this is one of the major themes of our politics today, why

aren't any candidates addressing it directly?<p>

<center><h3> A "Women's New Deal"</h3></center><p>



<font size=5>H</font>ISTORIANS have observed that this country long defined its politics by sex far more than

did other industrialized nations. Electoral politics in the nineteenth

century--an all-male activity--was closely linked with cultural ideas about

masculinity. With its rallies, shop talk, and fraternity, politics then was

something akin to sports today. Manhood was frequently an issue. In 1840 the

supporters of William Henry Harrison, a war hero, began an American tradition

by attacking the incumbent Martin Van Buren as a fop. "Little Van--the used-up

man" his enemies called him, noting that Van Buren favored ruffled shirts and

had achieved a new level of effeminacy because he enjoyed taking baths. A

victim of his own propaganda, the sixty-eight-year-old Harrison refused to wear

a coat to his chilly inauguration in March, caught pneumonia, and died a manly

death a month later. <p>

 

<img src="donkey.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>



Voting often took place in saloons; men whose party loyalty was wavering were

called "Miss-Nancys"; and reformers were depicted as politically impotent.

<A HREF="http://biron.usc.edu/~clare/tannen.html">Deborah Tannen</A>, a linguist who has written several books about differences in

how the sexes communicate, maintains that American politics retains the

masculine perspective of its nineteenth-century origins. "It's still so clear

that it was structured with a male audience in mind," she says. "There's all

the sports analogies, the ritual opposition, the warlike debate formats, even

the ways our leaders get points for being successful in military situations.

The basic assumptions and rhetoric are still far more reflective of a male

perspective." This was the framework within which women began to be politically

active in the nineteenth century, long before they had the vote. <p>



In Colonial times men had been viewed as "the fathers of the community,"

responsible for its morality. The Industrial Revolution, however, pulled men

out of the home, so women assumed the role of civic custodians. Abolitionism

had disproportionate support from women, and through missionary work and

benevolent societies women led later morality-based movements to ban

prostitution, discourage child labor, and encourage temperance. One of the

earliest political surveys, in 1919, showed that women in Illinois were twice

as supportive of Prohibition as men--the first recorded gender gap. <p>



The promise of women's suffrage was that women would cleanse politics and

American life of male excesses, and not simply by taking voting out of barber

shops and saloons and moving it into schools. At the turn of the century the

suffrage and Progressive movements were inextricably linked. As Rheta Childe

Door wrote in <i>What Eight Million Women Want</i> (1910), "Woman's place is in

the home. . . . But Home is not contained within the four walls of an

individual home. Home is the community. The city full of people is the Family.

The public school is the real Nursery." Women championed Progressive

social-welfare programs, including the creation in 1912 of the Children's

Bureau in the Department of Commerce and Labor, and the passage of the

Sheppard-Towner Infancy and Maternity Protection Act in 1921.<p>



In a recent pathbreaking work of social science, <i>Protecting Soldiers and

Mothers</i>, Theda Skocpol traces how these and other efforts undertaken by

women created an early patchwork system of social programs. Previous efforts,

relating to the old system of Civil War veterans' pensions, had failed--in no

small part because of middle-class opposition at the turn of the twentieth

century to a strong central government. The result was that unlike most

European states, America had a welfare state constructed not around the

"paternal" notion of work (workers' pensions and the like) but around

"maternal" programs defending mothers and families, deemed weaker and needing

protection. "Most of these programs, which were the forebears of the New Deal

and later welfare programs, were tied into the notion that motherhood was

really a form of community service," Skocpol says. <p>



For these reasons passage of the <A HREF="http://www.nara.gov/exhall/charters/constitution/19th/19th.html">Nineteenth Amendment</A> was widely expected to

change American politics and voting patterns immediately, to the benefit of the

more progressive Democrats. To almost everyone's surprise, however, it did not.

For the first decade or so after women got the vote, turnout was low and

conservative Republicans won most elections. By the time women did begin to

vote in greater numbers, the Depression had changed American politics--in the

words of Everett C. Ladd, the executive director of the Roper Center for Public

Opinion Research, at the University of Connecticut, reducing "the salience of

moral questions and elevating a variety of economic recovery concerns" that

masked the differences in the ways men and women approached politics. The

Depression forced male voters to consider the benefits of a "maternal" welfare

state and to change their allegiance--voting as women had been expected to vote

and, in fact, now were voting. "This not only meant a New Deal for women as

recipients," Sara Evans, a professor of history at the University of Minnesota,

wrote in her history of women in America, <i>Born for Liberty </i>(1989), "but

. . . in many ways a <i>women's</i> New Deal." New Deal social programs, such

as the Social Security Act of 1935 and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938,

were in part drafted and promoted by the old Progressive child-welfare

establishment, dominated by women whose view of government reflected their

maternal view of the state. For example, Aid to Families with Dependent

Children--still the program most commonly identified by politicians and the

public as "welfare"--was originally designed for children and mothers; it was

passed in 1935. <p>



Long after the Depression, both parties continued to favor the growth of the

welfare state that economic crisis had spawned. It is assumed that with

Americans entering a period of consumerism and conformity after the Second

World War, men and women tended to define their interests mutually, in terms of

their families, and to vote much the same. To be sure, the sexes approached

certain political questions differently, with men more likely to favor the use

of force than women, whether in military action or in the death penalty. When

Dwight Eisenhower promised in 1952 to "go to Korea" to end the war there, Roper

found that women preferred him to Adlai Stevenson by six percentage points more

than men. <p>



<img src="eleph.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>



Analysts also tended to find women voters almost everywhere to be risk-averse.

Abroad, where the divisions between parties were more ideological, that meant

that as women got the vote, they tended to align themselves with church-based

conservative parties as opposed to labor parties. In this country, however, the

differences in the ways the sexes approached political issues hadn't really led

to differences in partisan allegiance yet. To the extent that differences

existed in presidential voting from 1960 to 1980, women tended to slightly

favor incumbents or candidates of the incumbent party. In 1960--despite the

myth now prevailing that John Kennedy owed his victory over Richard Nixon to

his appeal to women--Nixon actually carried women narrowly. Women in 1976

favored the Democrat Jimmy Carter less than men did, and women voted in greater

percentages than men for Lyndon Johnson (1964) and Hubert Humphrey (1968). (In

1972 men supported the incumbent Richard Nixon by only one percentage point

more than women did, as George McGovern attracted some women with a peace

platform.)<p>

<center><h3> Women and the Rights Revolution </h3></center><p>

<font size=5>D</font>URING this period the Great Society programs of the mid-1960s were extending

the social-welfare state of the New Deal while for the first time on the

federal level (in the Civil Rights Act of 1964) broadly endorsing the notion of

sexual equality. In the wake of the civil-rights movement many Great Society

programs were aimed at the needs of the poor. Fifteen years later many were

disproportionately helping women, if only for demographic reasons: with divorce

rates and the number of single-parent households climbing, more women were

poor, and they lived longer than men. Thus by 1982, 61 percent of Medicaid

enrollees, 60 percent of Medicare recipients, 69 percent of those who received

food stamps, and 67 percent of the clients of the Legal Services Corporation

were women. Two thirds of the families living in federally subsidized housing

were headed by women. The welfare state was more maternal than ever.<p>



Moreover, the civil-rights legislation of the 1960s and early 1970s that was

intended to benefit women directly breezed through Congress. "We put

sex-discrimination provisions into everything," Representative Bella Abzug once

recalled about the 1971-1972 congressional session. "There was no opposition.

Who'd be against equal rights for women? So we just kept passing women's-rights

legislation." Yet the very speed with which these measures passed --and the

fact that many of them depended on courts to enforce or create new

"rights"--meant that they lacked the popular legitimacy of laws that have been

more widely debated. This might also be said about the racial rights revolution

of the 1950s and 1960s on which these initiatives were modeled. Yet that often

anti-majoritarian movement had a unique foundation, drawing on everything from

the nation's legacy of slavery to the hosings in Birmingham, which gave it a

legitimacy that women's-rights activists could not match. In fact, when it came

time, in the mid-1970s, for the states to pass an Equal Rights Amendment for

women, similar to the Fourteenth Amendment for blacks, the effort failed--with

Texas and Tennessee being the only states of the old Confederacy to ratify it.

The new Republican Party, built around the opposition of white southern males

to the sexual and race revolutions, was taking shape.<p>



The abortion wars of the 1970s also played into a general sentiment that the

women's movement was securing its gains in an anti-democratic fashion. In the

five years before the <i>Roe </i>v. <i>Wade</i> decision, in 1973, sixteen

states with more than 40 percent of the nation's population had liberalized

their abortion laws. In those days the issue was hardly a partisan one: Ronald

Reagan signed California's liberalizing law, whereas a restrictive Georgia

statute, struck down by the Supreme Court in a companion case to <i>Roe</i>,

was law when Jimmy Carter was governor. Absent the Court's decision in <i>Roe

</i>v. <i>Wade</i>, most state legislatures would probably have continued to

vote to permit abortion along the lines mandated by <i>Roe</i>. By taking the

decision out of voters' hands, however, the Supreme Court unintentionally

reinforced a notion that women were achieving gains in something less than a

legitimate manner.<p>



Yet <i>Roe </i>became extremely important to upper-middle-class activists in

liberal women's groups and also to fundamentalists in conservative groups--both

of whom saw it as the leading symbol of the feminist movement. The result was

twofold: After <i>Roe </i>v. <i>Wade</i>, abortion was quickly tagged by the

press and others as "<i>the </i>women's issue," which meant that other issues

that, according to polls, actually concerned women more--such as wages and

child care--got slighted. And as the sexes tended to drift into separate

political parties, those parties adopted the abortion positions of their

activist wings. Within a few years it was unthinkable for the Democrats not to

support upholding <i>Roe </i>v. <i>Wade</i> in their platform, and for the

Republicans not to promise to try to overturn it. <p>



As the feminist revolution in the culture and the workplace began to take hold

in the 1970s, pollsters began to pick up significant differences between men

and women--if not yet in their choice of presidential candidates, then in

attitudes on issues in addition to the use of force. Though women had always

been somewhat less likely to support insurgent nominees, they were especially

wary of the confrontational candidates who were now cropping up, who harked

back to something the country hadn't seen in a generation. Two thirds of George

Wallace's supporters nationally, for example, were male. There continued to be

no significant difference between the sexes in their attitudes on social issues

such as abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment, but analysts in the 1970s

found women to be more pessimistic than men about the country's future (though

not about their own), and even more risk-averse than before. "For the first

time since polling began, you began to see significant differences on the

proper role of government, with women favoring such things as full guaranteed

employment more than men," says Karlyn Bowman, a resident fellow at the

American Enterprise Institute. "And women were now even more likely to avoid

risk: differences on the use of force got larger, and in response to questions,

women would oppose more strongly than men things such as the location of a

nuclear plant in their area."<p>

<pre>

<center><h3>The Gender Gap Emerges</h3></center><p>

<font size=5>I</font>N 1980 these and other differences between the sexes began to translate into

partisan differences--and for the first time, pollsters systematically began to

measure them. That year women favored Jimmy Carter by eight percentage points

more than men, according to the <i>New York Times</i>/CBS News exit poll:

Carter lost 47 percent to 46 percent among women and 55 percent to 38 percent

among men. After the election, however, in contrast to prior patterns, women

drifted away from the new President while men flocked to him, so that within a

year, one poll found, men approved of the incumbent by about 15 percentage

points more than women did. <p>

The reason, of course, was Ronald Reagan himself--the first President to talk

openly of government as "the enemy" and of dismantling the protections of the

modern welfare state that both parties had endorsed almost since women had

gotten the vote.<p>



 At the same time, certain trends had been crystallizing as a result of the

so-called second wave of feminism, which had begun with the promise of making

men and women equal. Yet, ironically, the more men and women were accorded

equal treatment in the culture, the less they resembled each other politically.

By 1980, for the first time, more than half of all women worked outside the

home, and pollsters found that those who did work were far more likely to vote

differently from men than those who did not. The jobs that women who worked

outside the home held were disproportionately in the public sector (where

discrimination was less acute), in federal and state bureaucracies that were

beginning to raise taxpayers' ire because they were growing far faster than

seemed justified. Men and women had once tended to vote as family units, but as

divorce rates doubled, from 1965 to 1979, and more women chose to remain

single, the family began to splinter. <p>



With divorce and illegitimacy increasing, growing numbers of families came to

be headed by women, who tended to be poorer than men similarly situated. In

1978 analysts began to describe "the feminization of poverty"--a trend that led

more women than men to be dependent on and supportive of government welfare

programs. As the Democratic Party increasingly became associated with

preserving the welfare state from Republican attack, the parties started to

take on distinct sexual identities--a trend strengthened by Democratic support

in the early 1980s for the women-dominated "nuclear freeze" movement, which was

opposed by most Republicans, and by the prominent place the <A HREF="http://www.democrats.org/contact/campaign/#WOMEN">Democratic Party

gave to leaders and causes associated with liberal women's group</A>s, including

the <A HREF="http://now.org/now/home.html">National Organization for Women</A>. <p>



Men observed the trend too--and it especially affected those who saw themselves

as falling even further out of the economic mainstream than women but also as

having been abandoned by a "feminized" Democratic Party that had once defined

their interests as paramount. By 1980 the country was into a continuing

economic cycle that has seen the pay and economic status of men steadily

decline in real terms. According to the Labor Department, from 1979 to 1995 the

median annual earnings for male workers dropped 11.5 percent, while those for

female workers rose by about half that much. Though women's earnings are still

only about three quarters of men's, around 60 percent of the new jobs in the

1980s went to women. <p>



Reagan in 1984 and Bush in 1988 carried majorities of women, but the gap also

widened in response to the Gulf War--with a majority of women and Democratic

members of Congress opposing the Gulf War Resolution and a majority of men and

Republican members of Congress supporting it. By the early nineties Christopher

Matthews and other political analysts were beginning to outline the ways in

which the two parties often mirrored sex stereotypes--with the Democrats being

seen as the "Mommy" party (concerned about education and health care), and the

Republicans as the "Daddy" party (strong on defense and crime). <p>

<pre>



</pre>



<center><h3> A Party for Daddy </h3></center><p>

<font size=5>B</font>ILL Clinton did only a few points better among women than he did among men.

Once he took office, however, he was responsible for widening the gap, as

Reagan had been twelve years earlier--only in reverse, as men this time fled

the incumbent's camp. In Clinton's case the reaction among men seemed almost

visceral. Taken separately, his coffee-klatch managerial style, his propensity

to schmooze and gossip, his celebrated indecision, his discomfort with military

procedures, and his constant emphasis on diversity and inclusion might seem

unremarkable, as might his early decision to make it easier for gays to serve

in the military and his insistence that a woman had to be placed in the job of

first law-enforcement officer in the country. Taken together, however, these

attributes and actions presented a portrait of leadership many men apparently

found effeminate.<p>

Hillary Rodham Clinton was also a part of the cause. A joke in Clinton's early

months went something like "In the last Administration we used to worry what

would happen if Bush became sick and we got Quayle. Now we worry what would

happen if Hillary became sick and we got Bill." Polls on Hillary Clinton also

showed an enormous and unusual gender gap: women approved 60 percent to 25

percent and men only 40 percent to 37 percent. <p>



In the 1994 congressional elections, which produced a Republican victory,

turnout among women was the lowest since 1974. "Democrats would have retained

control of both the House and Senate if women had been as excited about the

Democrats as men were about the Republicans," Celinda Lake wrote in a memo

shortly after the election. She said later, in an interview, "The women who

didn't turn out in proportionate numbers tended to be non-college-educated

women. They were very disappointed with the way the health-care effort led by

Hillary had failed, and they didn't think the President had done enough to

focus on the economy." Andrew Kohut, of the Pew Research Center, suggests that

the well-publicized 1994 Paula Jones suit for sexual harassment may also have

played a major role in depressing enthusiasm for Clinton among these women.<p>



So, again, a gap predicted to help Democrats had really helped Republicans.

"The Republican stars . . . are ushering in a fresh image of masculine

government," the conservative columnist Suzanne Fields wrote a month after the

election. With the Republicans trying to dismantle a welfare state that many

women feel is responsible for securing and protecting their gains of the past

two decades, it's no surprise that immediately following the 1994 midterm

elections the gender gap widened. The gap between the sexes tended to be

largest among those under thirty and those with a college education--where some

surveys now found it to be 34 points. "The joke we tell around the office is

that we don't see how a lot of these young professionals are going to be able

to find compatible spouses," Celinda Lake told a reporter. In the early 1996

presidential primaries, when there was still a race, the percentage of females

voting in the Republican primaries, according to exit polls, had shrunk to

40-45 percent from its customary 50 percent or slightly higher. And although

there is evidence that the gap has been narrowing somewhat in recent months, as

both women and men have concluded that the Republican revolution may be going

too far, most polling analysts now see it as a standard feature of our 

politics.<p>

<pre>



</pre>



<center><h3> "The Ambivalent Woman" </h3></center><p>

<font size=5>H</font>OW will the gender gap affect the 1996 election and our politics thereafter?

"The big question in 1996 is how threatened women will feel by what the

Republicans are doing," says Andrew Kohut, who has recently released surveys

showing the trend toward a gap to be stronger than ever. <A HREF="http://www.camelect.com/1095/lake.html">Celinda Lake</A> says her

figures show much the same thing, and argues that the gap's continued presence

could help Clinton--if he can get his voters to the polls to the extent that

the Republicans got out their vote in 1994. In the special Oregon senatorial

election last winter, for example, women favored the Democrat by seven points

and men the Republican by 10 points. Yet the Democrat won, because turnout

among women was huge--57 percent of the total electorate. <p>



Still, political trends of the past fifteen years suggest that if the

electorate continues to divide increasingly along sex lines, it will help the

Republicans. Although polls so far show that the gap does appear to be aiding

the Democrats this year, that may be a one-election reaction to Bob Dole's age

(and his lack of appeal to some men) and to the way Republicans have frightened

voters with their threats of Medicare cuts. More important, the whole political

debate has now shifted so far to the right--with both presidential candidates

endorsing balanced budgets and substantial cuts in the welfare state--that no

matter who gets elected in November, the agenda of the "Daddy" party is going

to prevail. That's why Everett C. Ladd, of the Roper Center, can say, "In

truth, women are not really more Democratic than they were fifteen years ago.

It's that men have become more Republican." And so, therefore, has the

country.<p>



The press often describes this as a "backlash," but it's more complicated than

that. In a universe where one party is identified with men and the other with

women, most men see something of themselves in the male party. But many

women--principally homemakers and the traditionally religious--are still

unlikely to respond to a female party, at least as that party has been defined

by the Democratic left or by media sympathetic to feminist causes. According to

Celinda Lake, recent elections have tilted Republican not so much because of

men but because of what she describes as "the ambivalent woman." What's more,

in a politics defined by gender identification men are more likely to rally to

a male standard than women to a female one. Men still tend to follow

conventional politics far more closely than women do; they are more likely to

find their identity in it and to be energized by it. That's especially true

when they feel they are unfairly under siege. As Todd Gitlin writes in another

context in his new book, <i>The Twilight of Common Dreams</i>, many men

demonized as conservative white males will ironically seek out the very

stereotypical identity with which they have been tagged.<p>



Some strategists say that part of the problem is that the male leadership of

the Democratic Party is having trouble meshing with its new constituency. "The

Republican leaders, who are men, understand the male vote," Lake says. "But I

sense that a lot of Democratic male leaders are uncomfortable with their new

base of women." That may be why the Democratic Party is having trouble finding

its voice in this new era and why so many of its old leaders, such as Sam Nunn

and Bill Bradley, are leaving politics. In fact, Paula Baker, an associate

professor of history at the University of Pittsburgh and the author of several

articles on sex and politics, sees the general disenchantment with the

Democratic Party--and, indeed, with politics and government altogether--as a

direct result of sex-based shifts. "There's a trend in American history that

when women enter a particular activity or profession, men then often think less

of that domain," Baker says. "When anything becomes feminized, the pay

diminishes, the stratification in the work increases, and the status

diminishes." <p>

<pre>



</pre>



<center><h3> The Individual and the Community </h3></center><p>

 

<font size=5>T</font>HE importance of the gender gap can be misinterpreted--as the media have

frequently demonstrated over the past fifteen years. Moreover, while the voting

gaps that once divided us over religion and class have become less important,

other gaps--such as those defined by race and education--reveal larger fault

lines in the electorate than does the gender gap.<p>



In American politics, however, where most battles tend to be fought in the

cautious middle, a shift of only 10 percent of the electorate can cause a

realignment. In the wake of the O. J. Simpson verdict and the Million Man March

on Washington last year many commentators called for a more open public

discussion of our racial problems. Yet with all its complications, race gets

discussed far more openly and, often, intelligently in politics than does the

new role of women or male fears of displacement. The welfare debate focuses on

race almost to the exclusion of sex. In discussions of affirmative action in

the media the focus is almost always on race. When analysts talk about the

"white male revolt" of 1994, they tend to focus on the "white," not the "male."

Politicians and editorialists call every day for healing the racial divisions

in the culture, but no one ever calls for a similar reconciliation on gender

issues. "This is the elephant in the room that no one's willing to

acknowledge," says the social and cultural historian Elaine Tyler May. "Because

men and women live together in the same families, people are conflicted. It's a

very difficult issue to discuss openly, because the intimacy complicates the

matter." In truth, the gender gap has become a convenient metaphor for

addressing an issue that has always troubled Americans--finding a workable

balance between the cherished values of libertarianism on the one hand and

communitarianism on the other. It should probably not surprise us that in a

troubled and confused age we have somehow managed to combine these two

preoccupations into one abiding, if rarely articulated, fixation that now

permeates and defines our politics. And in the end it is inevitable that

changes as momentous as the ones sparked by the women's movement will produce

dislocations. Traditional notions of what it means to be a man or a woman have

been woven into our notions of what a government ought to provide. As a British

writer, Julie Burchill, once said, "Only America could have started the men's

movement in a country which had not passed the Equal Rights Amendment, nor

given women the right to terminate their pregnancies while giving men every

right to abandon pregnant women."

	<font size=5>W</font>ere you ever a member of a school board? If not, then have hardly been
revealed to you, in their fullest measure, the machinations and tendencies of
the dual forces that combine to establish our public schools: the educational
forces on the one hand, and the public or political forces on the other. To the
thoughtful board member are revealed the inherent weaknesses of the
public-school system as developed in America. To him are shown "the foibles and
fancies of the educationist, the heedlessness and pettiness of the more
thoughtless element in the constituency, and, alas! the limitations of the
teachers. And he is constantly comparing the ideal schools he supposed to exist
before he got his intimate insight, and the schools he really discovered after
his official relationship began. This disillusioning is distracting.<p>

<p>

Just at present there is a stirring about in the public-school world. Some mild
muckrakers have been busy with the rake, and are trying to find out "What is
the matter with our public schools;" and a few conscientious critics are
pointing out genuine weaknesses in the RESULTS of our public-school system.
This commotion comes almost like a shock, after a long lull which had put us to
sleep in the pedagogical cradle, bringing us pleasant dreams about the great
public-school system, the pride of the land, the glory of the nation and so
forth. For everybody was quite sure that these schools were the bulwark of our
freedom, and that they somehow were too sacred to be criticised. At the same
time, every one reserved the right to decided personal opinions about the way
these schools should be run. For there is no other public institution so
universally lauded in bulk, and so criticised in parvo, as the public-school
system.<p>

<p>

The results of the school system that are challenged in these newer indictments
may be brought under three groups.<p>

<p>

First, we are told that the pupil does not gain real knowledge. He studies
about things, in an indefinite sort of way, but never learns the solid facts.
The whole system, from the happy kindergarten to the mimic-college high school,
is permeated with the haze of indefiniteness. There is present only the mirage
of learning, not the substantial reality. The old-fashioned drilling has
vanished. The line upon line and precept upon precept method, that builds real
brain-substance, is replaced by pseudo-psychological "methods" taught in
"normal" schools. The result is, the pupil is not trained in exactness and
thoroughness.<p>

<p>

Secondly, we are told that the pupil does not even learn to use his mind.
Schoolmasters give as an excuse for the lack of exactness in their pupils, that
the boys and girls have learned how to use their mental equipment even though
they do not know very many facts. But here is a substantial arraignment of this
supposed result of modern school methods. The school is an enslaver of memory
instead of an emancipator of reasoning. Originality is tabooed, and servility
demanded. The curse of the lawyer, the search for precedent, is written on the
brow of pedagogy. Logic and reason are not encouraged.<p>

<p>

And, thirdly, the results of our schools are not practical. This is heard on
every hand. The schools do not fit for bread-and-butter earning, they rather
make a boy or girl unfit for the hard tasks of life.<p>

<p>

A fourth count in the indictment is sometimes added by the moralist, who claims
that the moral traits of the child are hardly awakened, and that the boys and
girls, especially those who break the ranks before the eighth grade is reached,
are entirely unfit to meet the severe demands that the temptations of life make
upon them.<p>

<p>

These, briefly, are the charges. They may be summed up by saying that, in a
very general and unsatisfactory way, the schools teach the elements of mental
processes: that they, to this extent only, teach morals; and that they leave
the aptitudes, manual and mental, in about as dormant a condition as they found
them in.<p>

<p>

These charges are made against the RESULTS of our public education. But these
results are the outgrowth of CONDITIONS. I do not wish here to discuss the
indictment, I wish only to describe frankly some of the conditions that prevail
in our public schools, from which these undesirable consequences have grown.
These plain facts I present, as they were unfolded to me while serving on the
Board of Education in one of our large cities, where conditions are perhaps a
little above the average.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>I.</font></b><p>

<p>

And I begin with the teacher. For the teacher is the school. And in considering
the teacher we must begin with the superintendent. The position of
superintendent of schools is unique and anomalous. It demands the learning of a
college president, the consecration of a clergyman, the wisdom of a judge, the
executive talent of a financier, the patience of a church janitor, the humility
of a deacon, and the craftiness of a politician. The position demands that the
superintendent manage the schools purely as an educational investment for the
public, without being in any degree influenced by the passions and impulses of
the public. It is because of these requirements, which would tax genius and
divinity, that there are so few real superintendents. If you should attend a
meeting of the National Association of Superintendents, for the purpose of
seeking one for your home town, you would be depressed by the scarcity of
first-class material for so important a place. You would learn, on inquiry,
that most of these men drifted into the superintendency,-- they just happened
into the job. Some were educated for the ministry, some for the bar, some for
medicine, a few had been in business, all of them had been teachers, but only a
small minority had started out in life by choosing the regal following of
educational leader as a profession, and had persisted in their laudable
ambition with courage and perseverance. Until very recently, there was no
college or university that paid any attention to school administration in its
curriculum. Those great centres of learning to which the nation rightly looks
for educational guidance were blind to the great needs of the common schools;
so that a man, ambitious to become a successful superintendent of schools, had
to pick his own way, prepared by experience and inclination but not by
scientific guide. The result was perfectly natural. The making of
superintendents was left to chance, and to those interested forces which
contrived to gain the mastery of the situation. Some superintendents were thus
made by party politics, some by certain commercial interests, some by coteries
of teachers or cliques of busybodies, and some, we may be very sure, by a happy
and conscientious choice. These last have been, fortunately, the propulsive
force in American public education, and the nation owes a large debt of
gratitude to the great pioneer superintendents, who rose above the
circumstances of their appointments and gave conscience and professional
prowess to their tasks.<p>

<p>

Happily there is now growing up in our country a group of young men who have
definitely chosen educational administrative work as their profession who have
been trained for their calling in colleges that have recognized their special
needs, and who, it is hoped will prove strong enough to withstand the
temptations that are peculiar to public office. But ideal professional guidance
in public school affairs will not be possible until some of the conditions
surrounding the office of Superintendent are changed. The office must be
entirely separated from the haphazard of politics. Formerly the superintendent
was elected in many states by the people on party tickets. One of our large
cities even today clings to this barbarous custom to its shame and the great
detriment of its school system. At present it is almost the universal custom to
elect the superintendent through the board of education. Even under this
practice he is still made to feel the insecurity of his tenure. For the board
members are elected, and through them the people can strike at the
superintendent. Every city is prone to have a superintendent war about every
ten or twenty years. A man who has to direct so many teachers, placate so many
parents and come in practical contact with the public every day will make
enemies, especially if he is a robust and enterprising man. And these enemies
will seek revenge at the polls. So, in order to raise a generation of
professional superintendents it will not be enough to have them trained in the
technique of their profession. The tenure of office must be made long enough
and secure enough from interference by either the board or the public to
attract scholarly men.<p>

<p>

While there has been so much of chance in the making of the superintendent,
there has been a more earnest attempt made in the training of teachers although
even our normal schools are of comparatively recent origin. School-teaching is
even now scarcely a profession. People still think that almost any one can be a
teacher. In truth, any one who can pass the required examinations and get a
certificate is legally qualified to teach. These requirements are usually so
low that a graduate of an ordinary high school can pass them. Indeed our cities
maintain normal schools that are filled with girls taken green from the high
school who are given two years of seasoning in method and are then turned back
into the public schools whence they came. This perpetual stream wends its
never-varying circuit annually swelled only occasionally by the addition of a
few women or men who have had a college education.<p>

<p>

This kind of hurry-up training emphasizes method not character; memory, not
logic. It tends to make education mechanical, impersonal. It leads the youthful
pedagogue to teach arithmetic and reading, when she should be told to teach
Johnny and Mary. For education that is not individual, that does not respond
hopefully and joyously to the magic of personal association, results in mental
palsy. Our meagre starveling way of preparing teachers degrades the schools and
the profession. The basis of teaching must be knowledge, and how shall they
teach if they have not knowledge? The inspiration of teaching must be
personality, but how shall they inspire if they have no soul for their work?<p>

<p>

Moreover, this factory method of making teachers inclines to shrivel them. The
exactions of their daily tasks, goodness knows, are severe enough to deaden
their wider instincts. The stronger reason why their preliminary training
should be of the greatest diameter. The natural propensities of all human
beings are easily influenced by their vocations. Perhaps this is why some
teachers are so apt to be narrow and unsympathetic toward persons and events
that lie beyond the pale of their immediate work. There must be a broad
sympathetic spirit at the basis of every profession; and it is this spirit that
marks the subtle distinction between a calling and a business--a distinction
that is important and potent.<p>

<p>

Of course, the vast majority of public-school-teachers are women. Probably this
will always be true, though more men are surely needed. Thirty years ago it was
almost the only occupation a woman could enter. To-day the call of many
occupations reaches her ear. The result is that many of the ablest and most
robust women who must work, avoid teaching, and the ranks of the public-school
teachers must suffer from this loss.<p>

<p>

The state has certainly not done its part to glorify the profession of
teaching. It has not lured talent, either by offering preparatory schools equal
to those of the other professions, or by offering adequate pay. Our school
resources are too small on all sides. The maximum tax levy for school purposes
is usually fixed by state law, and the harassed school board is continually
confronted by the task of doling out the resources at hand among teachers, and
buildings, and supplies, and playgrounds, and free lectures, and a hundred
other things that call for money. They are, as a rule, as generous with the
teachers as the state permits them to be. On the other hand, better pay should
be contingent upon a broader preparation, more effective service, a more
genuine spirit of helpfulness, less petty self-seeking, and a more liberal
outlook on life. Money alone cannot create a profession.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>II.</font></b><p>

<p>

Out of such educational conditions has come the course of study. What shall
these teachers teach? This seems to be a universal enigma. The question was not
asked seventy years ago. The itinerant schoolmaster, boarding round, and
gathering his flock from the scattered huts of the pioneers, taught reading
writing and arithmetic. And the refulgent halo of the three R's rests above the
traditions of these early district schools. With a little history, geography,
and spelling added, this remained the course of study until some educator
suddenly awoke to the fact that, while science was eagerly and rapidly
enlarging the domain of human knowledge, while human ingenuity was binding the
continents into unity, and civilization was moving forward with swift strides,
the course of study had remained quite stationary. So the prop of "enriching"
began. But alas! the enriching proceeded from books and theories, to the
exclusion of the vital needs of the state. So much frosting has been put on the
loaf, and so many raisins put within, that very little of the nourishing
substance is left.<p>

<p>

This course of study, being built by educators who have studied books rather
than civilization, is bookish. Its creators being theorists rather than
empiricists, it is transcendental. And the cry of an awakening nation is, "Back
to the fundamentals. Make education practical. This is the extreme reaction on
the part of the people from the extreme attempt on the part of educators to
embellish the curriculum. The impulsive public, electing its school board,
demands a "practical education," but fails to define what constitutes a
practical education. So with the swaying pendulum we are bound to have either
Day-Dreamer or Gradgrind.<p>

<p>

Thus far we have been told not to meddle with the course of study. We the
laymen, must keep our hands off and let the professional educator arrange the
schedules. And as a result every fad and fancy has been given a place, until
the printed course of study resembles the menu card of a metropolitan
restaurant. Modernly, every teacher has her psychologists and the beautiful
science of child-study has been wounded and torn by thousands of clumsy,
awkward amateurs, whose addenda to this "course" of study make the schools
ridiculous to earnest, sensible men. These varied and all-embracing programmes
of study presuppose every Tommy and Mary Ann to be a modern Lotze, capable of
greater feats of genius than constructing, or even comprehending, a
Microcosmos. <p>

<p>

Of course it is all dealt out in homeopathic doses. There are pellets of
anatomy and physiology, of painting and drawing, of psychology and philosophy,
of a little arithmetic and a little grammar. All the pellets are sugar-coated,
for the whole pedagogical theory seems to command that the teacher make all
these things easy for the pupil. So we have all kinds of patent devices for
making the child's pathway one of velvet. There are wonderful new text-books
that have all the lessons analyzed and classified, leaving very little for
exertion. There are charts, multi-colored, that simplify the lessons, and
pictures and cabinets that illustrate the charts. Everything is put in the
pupils' hands. Genuine effort seems to be discouraged.<p>

<p>

The vicious, immoral thing about all this is, that it enacts a great and
terrible lie to the child. He is made to believe that superficiality is a
substitute for thoroughness, and that effort is superfluous as well as
unpleasant. And what is even more cruel, he is entirely unprepared for the
school of life, where no teacher and no text are at his side to resolve his
tasks from work into play.<p>

<p>

And this hodge-podge of "essentials" and "enrichments" the teacher is told to
dole out by "method." And mere method, technical routine, is the deadly enemy
of individual work. And individual development is the supreme function of human
life. Society could endure the crazy patchwork of an enriched course of study,
and the stern competition of life teach the youth the lessons of perseverance
and application; but society cannot long endure the suppression of personality.
Our machine-made teachers are, by machine methods, making of our splendid boys
and girls, each one stamped with the divinity of individuality, mere
machines.<p>

<p>

Now that the educator has had his day in telling us what to teach and how to
teach it, the taxpayer is beginning to teach the pedagogue. He approaches the
question from the bread-and-butter side. He leaves the basic studies in the
course, follows the child into the world, and asks for RESULTS. The danger from
this is apparent.<p>

<p>

In the technique of the course of study, America is just beginning to learn
from Germany the lesson of differentiation. Heretofore we have crammed
everything into one building, and into one course of study. For instance, the
city high school, the offspring of the old academy, has had tacked on to it
some work in manual training and also some few commercial studies. The product
is a hybrid, neither a technical school, nor a commercial school, nor a
classical school. The time has now come for separating the diverse organs, and
developing their functions. Technical and commercial high schools, fully
equipped and doing a splendid work, are now found in our most advanced
cities.<p>

<p>

Of the grades the same is true. The trade-school is coming into vogue rapidly.
It has come to stay. But not as an adjunct to the present grade schools. It
will be an entity by itself. As our country fills up, this differentiation will
increase. It must become our national economic salvation.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>III.</font></b><p>

<p>

These American schools are public schools. This lends to them at once their
greatest significance, their greatest power, and their greatest handicap: is at
once the source of their wonderful strength and their gravest weakness. The
handicaps mentioned above are technical, and to a great extent can be remedied;
probably in the course of fifty years they will be. But when shall the foibles
of the people be consumed, and when their impulsiveness tamed? The schools
belong to everybody, and everybody wants to keep his spoon in the educational
porridge, and stir, and stir, and stir.<p>

<p>

Of the hampering and intermeddling public, the most excusable portion is the
unreasonable parent. Parents who may be reasonable about all their neighbors
and about all other subjects, are not unlikely to become impatient and
unreasonable about school matters that pertain to their own children. It
becomes a question of my Charlie versus your Charlie. Of course the variety of
subjects that appeal to the unreason of such people is limitless. It may be a
matter of discipline, or of transfer, or of personal pique against the teacher,
or any one of a thousand different trivialities. But this particular species of
parent immediately magnifies it into an astounding greatness, and usually makes
a neighborhood issue of it. This may merely be annoying; always it is
irritating; and sometimes, unfortunately, it becomes inflaming. Then it leads
to written charges, to court-martial by the superintendent, star-chamber
sessions by the board, lawsuits in the courts, and to political issues at the
polls. Superintendents have been ousted, principals discharged, teachers'
hearts broken, by these unreasonable meddlers. Such instances will recur, in
various guises, to the reader. One fractious parent can upset an entire
neighborhood, and dispel that beautiful spirit of cooperation between the home
and the school that forms the real potency of education.<p>

<p>

When this unreasonable ire is poured out upon a board member, its results are
far less deplorable, for he is not as essential to the welfare of the schools,
and has weapons at his command. While his life is made a burden by all kinds of
busybodies, he yet has the imperial privilege of talking back.<p>

<p>

Then there are many groups or special interests which try to use the schools to
further their enterprises or prejudices. Among these the party politician may
be placed first. Happily he is a vanishing factor in school elections and
administration. The boards are in some states still nominated by party
machinery, and placed on party tickets, but the Australian ballot and
nomination by petition are being widely adopted for the school ticket. This
removes the board from party politics so far as such a thing is possible. But
the party spoilsman, in some cities, still looks upon school janitors and
employees as legitimate party spoils. And he even ventures to call on the
superintendent and board members to suggest appointments for the teachers'
roll, or to further the promotion of some teacher who may be related to an
influential citizen, not infrequently accompanying his "request" with a mild
threat. It is to the interest of the partisan, of course, that members are
elected to the board whom he can use. Such men are ordinarily unfit for
administering school affairs. It is an axiom that the usefulness to a community
of a board-member increases directly as his political partisanship decreases.
No doubt a purely political school board, particularly a board, has been one of
the great curses of our public schools. But they are almost a thing of the
past, and with their departure will vanish the attempts to use schools for
purely partisan ends.<p>

<p>

Of course, there is "politics" in everything,--in church, in business, wherever
a group of men and women are contending for place and power. This instinct for
playing the game of human nature is strongly developed in Americans, and forms
the motive of our remarkable organizations, and all our public institutions are
peculiarly subject to these influences. This spirit lends itself very readily
to trivial transactions. Old-time politics are not nearly so destructive to
school efficiency as are the petty "peanut" politics called forth by
grievances, by revenge, by commercial cupidity, and a score of other petty
potencies. Take, for instance, the question of retiring a superannuated
teacher. Even in cities that provide a pension fund, this is a most delicate
and hazardous undertaking for superintendent and board. If the teacher of sixty
or seventy years does not wish to retire gracefully and peacefully, she calls
upon her hundreds of former pupils, many of them now leading business and
professional men, she calls on the city editor of the daily papers, on her
minister, her doctor, and her lawyer, on the members of her lodge and her
church, and together they march in motley array, with grim energy, upon the
school officials, more determined than crusaders, and, quite convinced that the
welfare of the world is hanging on the outcome of their fight. If the school
authorities yield, discipline goes wild. If they persist, the crowd threatens
and plays politics when the term of the superintendent or board expires. And it
is surprising what a fine class of citizens can be enlisted in these grievance
campaigns. Men and women who surely ought to know better, who are expected to
be self-possessed, allow themselves to be carried to ridiculous extremes over
such matters.<p>

<p>

Likewise the dismissal of incompetent teachers is made almost impossible in
some communities by such over-zealous delirium on the part of good people.
Sometimes lodges, business organizations, and even churches, are used as
cudgels over the heads of the miserable school authorities. I have known a
sewing society in a certain church in a small town to champion an unworthy
superintendent and lead the fight to the polls, and, by virtue of the anomalous
law that gives women the franchise in school questions, carry on a campaign of
gossip and win an election.<p>

<p>

In most of our cities there is a prevalent, provincial feeling that looks with
disdain and disfavor upon the hiring of teachers from other towns. This
sentiment makes of our schools semi-eelymosynary institutions, whose principal
function is to give employment to the daughters and sons of the place. The bane
of this in-and-in breeding is felt in every large city. So acute is the feeling
that, if the superintendent goes abroad for a few alien teachers, he is decried
as disloyal, and he is fortunate if the disgruntled ones fail in organizing a
foolish opposition to his well-meant endeavor to infuse new life into his
schools. There are instances on record where a determined parent has set out to
elect a school board so that her daughter might be appointed a teacher, though
she was lacking both in spirit and knowledge. "I have lived here thirty years
and paid taxes, and the city owes it to me to employ my daughter rather than
hire some one from out of town who never helped make this city," said an irate
parent to me, after I had told him I could not interfere with the appointing of
teachers by the superintendent. And this feeling is quite as prevalent as it is
hurtful to the schools.<p>

<p>

Another form of school politics found in every city emanates from those
commercial interests which find it profitable to be able to control school
administration. While I believe the methods of book companies and supply houses
have been very greatly improved in the last twenty years, it still remains true
that some of their methods are inscrutable, and their attempt at interference
with the selection of school boards and superintendents is not conducive to the
best educational results. The popular estimate of the amount and manner of this
interference is vastly and grotesquely exaggerated; but the involved interests
have only themselves to blame for this. Their competition often lacks that fair
and broadminded spirit that is usually found among business men, while any
unwarranted attempts to control school elections and appointments are hurtful
to the schools. Of course this can be said of any other public business.<p>

<p>

Still more unfortunate is it when a clique of teachers forms a cabal against
superiors for the purpose of furthering its own selfish interests. They succeed
at times in allying themselves with a faction in the board, and a reign of
terror follows their enthronement. Cheap pedagogical factionalism has crippled
many a school system. Only heroic remedies help such a pathological
condition.<p>

<p>

The result of all this agitation and potboiling is increased manifold by the
attitude of the sensational newspapers. Such papers find meat in quarrels, and
are always tempted to distort the truth into a misshapen thing. Fortunately
such newspapers are rare. Even the wildest among them profess a crocodile
interest in the children of the schools and the teachers. But even the best and
most conservative newspapers often do an irreparable injury to the educational
work of the schools by giving voice to the silly discontent and personal
vindictiveness of the disgruntled. Thus they awaken the distrust of the people
and lead to a loss of confidence, based on no adequate reason, that undermine
the work of conservative educators; The carping, fault-finding newspaper, that
never permits a cheerful, helpful adjective to escape its fonts, that is
pessimistic by policy, always hinting at things sinister, and saying that
thus-and-so affirms that this and that should have been done as it was not
done, and that so-and-so would have been better if this or that had not
happened, and so forth,--this newspaper is infinitely worse in its influence on
the schools than the senseless busybody and self-seeking meddler.<p>

<p>

It is always easier for a sore-head to get a big headline in the dailies than
for the constructive conservative; and unfortunately for society, human nature
is always more willing to listen to calumny than to praise, and to lend its
strength to tearing down than to building up.<p>

<p>

The consequence of all this multiformed political activity is, that turmoil
unseats tranquillity, dark discontent stalks by the side of cheerful
helpfulness, distrust dispels hope, and uneasiness and restlessness are felt
everywhere in the schools. All these disgruntled forces, by working in unison,
can usually elect at least one member to a board of education. Lucky is the
city where it is not a majority. This member is the grievance member. He, or
she, becomes the repository of all secret complaints. Dissatisfied teachers or
parents or neighbors pour out their imaginings into his or her lap. Reporters,
hard pressed for stuff, ply him or her with ingenious questions. The public is
fed on a diet of "suppose" and "they say," while the poor schools are a-quiver,
wondering what will happen next.<p>

<p>

If these disgruntled ones succeed in carrying an election, and with it a
majority of the board, then the voice of the sovereign people must of course be
obeyed. Whatever was the issue, usually kept in reserve during the campaign, it
must be dragged out and the will of the people vindicated--sometimes by
breaking the heart of a fine and cultured teacher; sometimes by discharging a
superintendent of independence and courage who refuses to do the bidding of the
unreasonable board, and dares to stand between people and their enemies;
sometime ripping up a course of study, or by dismissing a business manager, or
by reinstating a delinquent official. Whatever the original grievance, by the
time election is over it has grown, like a fast-rolling snowball, and the
avalanche is rushing on its destructive course.<p>

<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>IV.</font></b><p>

<p>

In spite of these volatile, irresponsible, disgruntled elements; in the teeth
of agitation about what to teach and how to teach it, and how to build and
where to build; against restlessness and suspiciousness on the part of teachers
and patrons, our free schools have vindicated the great wisdom of their
founders. At heart everybody believes in them, and they are among our most
cherished public possessions. We must not be blind to the handicaps that so
universally beset them.<p>

<p>

Before they can approach the idealized usefulness that so often is pictured of
them, they must be placed under purely professional control, out of the reach
of the mere agitator, the headless and heedless costermonger of educational
panaceas, and the unreason of the multitude. Moreover, there must be a saner
popular participation, finding expression in much more generous tax levies, and
the election of the wisest and sanest men the community to membership on the
governing board. There must come a greater public interest in the educational
work of the school. Some method will be devised, whereby the public will be
enabled to infuse some of its energy and practicalness into the school work.
The dividing of the city into small districts and appointing a committee of
visitors from each district, whose duty it is to visit the schools, and suggest
to the board of education and the superintendent such changes as they deem
wise, has produced good results in German cities. And there must certainly be
more educational aggressiveness on the part of the pedagogue, more response to
the actual needs of life, both cultural and vocational.<p>

<p>

It appears that the public-school educator needs tranquillity, freedom, and
enterprise. He needs tranquillity, because the development of his science
requires the repose of the study. The rude jolting of suspicion, jealousy,
vindictiveness, and bigotry are fatal to the growth of a sane pedagogical
science.<p>

<p>

He needs freedom, for an institution dependent upon the political vicissitudes
of the day cannot be stable and well poised.<p>

<p>

And, above all, he needs enterprise, the enterprise to match his schools with
our civilization.<p>

<p>

Maybe, if there were more genuine enterprise, not the make-believe, bustling
kind, among the educators, there would be a great deal less carping and
parsimoniousness on the part of the people. Maybe the public would hail with
great joy and cooperation such an energizing of the schools. Maybe it is too
much to hope that this tranquillity, freedom, and enterprise shall ever abide
in the schools that belong to an impulsive public which often seems to prefer a
self-complacent mediocrity to a virile efficiency.

	YLE and Deborah haven't been to New York before. The convention of the
East Coast Assassination Investigation Workshops has finally brought them to
the city, at Lyle's insistence. Deborah has found, even coming in from the
airport, that New York is as she has heard--the rudeness and all. She looks out
of the hotel van and sees a grungy man in another car staring at her,
unabashed. She looks away.</font><p>

"How safe do you think we'll be?" Deborah says.<p>

"Like I said before, we'll be fine," Lyle says. "As long as we stay in the
hotel or close by, we'll be fine. We'll be among friends."<p>

Lyle and Deborah are both forty-eight. They live in Denver now, where Lyle
services photocopiers and Deborah is in insurance. They have no children, and
for this reason they have the luxury of spending a week here. Lyle wanted to go
"all out" for this, and Deborah doesn't mind. At the regional conventions
they've been to, in Dallas three times, and also in Portland and Kansas City,
she has always found plenty to do while Lyle attends his seminars. Last year,
in Kansas City, while he sat through "The Warren Commission: Footnotes and
Falsehoods," she shopped and went sightseeing and had long, contemplative
lunches by herself. When they returned home, Lyle holed up in his basement file
room every night after dinner, sure he was on to something. Lyle feels he has
made a breakthrough, and this is why they have come to the Big One, in New
York. Their dogs, matching lhasa apsos named Zapruder and Mannlicher, are being
boarded at the veterinarian's.<p>

Checking in at the hotel, Lyle is recognized. When he says, "Reservation for
Lyle Asay," a man off to the rear of them says, "Umbrella Man." In this age of
specialization the Umbrella Man happens to be Lyle's specialty.<p>

"That man's talking to you, honey," Deborah says.<p>

"What?"<p>

"Him. He said, 'Umbrella Man.'"<p>

Lyle turns, and with a grin introduces himself. The man's name is Otto Litwak.
He is an eightyish man with the bearing of a professor. He, too, will be
attending tomorrow's 10:30 A.M. conference, "The Umbrella Man: Grassy Knoll,
Sunny Day--Signals and Codes?"<p>

"I am something of an expert myself," Litwak says, "although not of your
caliber. Word has come from the American interior about your work."<p>

"I don't recall hearing your name," Lyle says.<p>


"I stay in Trenton," Litwak says. "I don't travel much."<p>

All the way up in the elevator Lyle is ecstatic. Deborah asks him if it wasn't
rude to have said he'd never heard of the man. Lyle says, "But I never have."
<p>

Although he is not a panel member at the conference, Lyle has planned to seize
the floor and present his findings, which he believes will prove that the
Umbrella Man was the linchpin of the conspirators' plan. Seizing the floor is a
part of the culture, and he has already circulated word that he'll be doing it.
He was worried that he might not be known in New York as he is in Kansas City
and Portland, but now that fear is laid aside.<p>

"People are expecting me!" Lyle says. He's got his tan suit on, with the big
cowboy hat, as if he were a Texas Ranger, or maybe a cattleman.<p>

"This is the big moment!" he says. "This is where they bite the bullet!" Then
he says what he always says when he's excited: "Jack, you son of a bitch!"<p>

<img src="Fictiona.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

Lyle has been saving up and doing his research for two years, waiting to be
here, and his excitement has been further churned by rumors that Oliver Stone
will show up to speak. Lyle and his friends believe that Stone will be making a
sequel to <i>JFK</i>, and word is that he will hire three technical advisers
for hundreds of thousands of dollars each.<p>

Deborah knows very little about Lyle's theories. She prefers to ignore them.
She believes in a single shooter. Had he known this before they married, she
knows, it would have been a sign of incompatibility he couldn't stomach. So she
has distanced herself. "Kennedy's dead and we can't change that," she says to
Lyle when he asks her opinion on things. There is an unreflective doggedness in
these words that Lyle clearly finds disturbing, and therefore avoids. He hasn't
asked for years. For the most part their marriage is good.<p>

All the way from the house in Denver, Lyle has carried his heavy briefcase with
him, and now he is unwilling to trust it to the bellhop. Deborah has decided
that his next Christmas gift should be a new briefcase, and that she will find
a way to have a handcuff attached. She knows Lyle well enough to know that
he'll love it: it will be a semi-serious gift, like the pink pillbox hat he got
her a few years ago. He has a flair for showmanship, and for paranoia. In the
airport coffee shop in Chicago, waiting to switch planes, he held the briefcase
between his ankles while they ate. <p>

In their room, when the rest of the luggage has arrived, he snaps open the
briefcase and stacks his piles of manila folders on the table. Deborah hangs up
their clothes, takes a shower, and gets dressed. At six o'clock she says,
"Lyle? Dinner?"<p>

He looks up from his papers as if she has just burst in unexpectedly. "Gee,
Deb," he says, "I don't know if I can, with my conference first thing in the
morning." He is nervous, she can tell. She shrugs. "I'll go down alone," she
says. "I need to get out of this room for a while."<p>

On the elevator down to the lobby she doesn't feel upset. This is typical.
After the Umbrella Man conference Lyle will attend another four and a half days
of meetings, but he will be more relaxed, having gotten past his own moment of
special attention.<p>

At the third floor a man steps into the elevator, and she sees that it is
Litwak.<p>

"Ah, Mrs. Asay!" he says. "Off to dine, are we?"<p>

"Lyle's reviewing his papers," she says. "He wants to be ready."<p>

"I should think you know a great deal about the Umbrella Man yourself," Litwak
says. "What is your favorite aspect of the case?"<p>

"Nothing, really," Deborah says. "I really don't pay much attention."<p>

Litwak laughs. "I'm sure you're being modest. I know that my own
accomplishments could not have amounted to anything without the support of the
late Mrs. Litwak. I remember how she'd listen to each of my new hypotheses, and
then rip it to shreds. Back to the drawing board! You must know the main points
of his argument."<p>

"I don't think so," she says. "Did your wife really do that?" She thinks she
has seen only men at these conventions.<p>

When they get off the elevator, Litwak nods good-bye and shuffles off toward
the street. In the hotel dining room Deborah has a club sandwich and orders a
glass of wine, and then she looks in the gift shop before returning to the
room. Lyle is in the same bent position as when she left.<p>

"I saw your friend Litwak on the elevator down," she says.<p>

This gets Lyle's attention. "What did he say?"<p>

"Nothing much. Just hello. He was asking for you."<p>

"Yeah? What was he asking?"<p>

"He was asking about your work."<p>


Lyle stands now, his hand still on a stack of papers. He has the umbrella out,
the one he brings to conferences, to demonstrate various postulates. He also
has a toy gun, a plastic Luger, to demonstrate the way it could be slipped
beneath the furled fabric. Lyle has told Deborah that he has learned the
theatrics necessary to his endeavors.<p>

"I've never heard of this guy," Lyle says. He picks up the telephone, retrieves
a slip of paper from his pocket, and dials. "Fritz Reis," he says. Fritz is
another buff from Denver, a close ally. He's staying at a less-expensive hotel
uptown.<p>

"Fritz? Lyle. Tell me if you've ever heard the name Otto Litwak." He listens.
"No, no. I mean now. He's here. I never have either. But he knows my work."<p>

When he hangs up, Lyle drums the desk with his fingers. "Fritz says he's never
heard of him. Greg is there, and he doesn't know him either. No one has ever
heard of him."<p>

Lyle picks up the house phone. "Do you have a guest by the name of Litwak
here?" he says. After a moment he says, "You don't? I see. Thank you." He looks
at Deborah. "Jack, you son of a bitch," he says.<p>

<p>
<br>
	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/L-small.gif" align=left 
	height=44 alt="L"></font>YLE and Deborah have been married twenty-two years. At first Deborah
didn't notice the obsession in Lyle. He was someone who seemed to take a
general interest in politics. He bought a few books. He was in his mid-twenties
and seemed to have better things to do. The reading he did, of the Warren
Commission report and <i>Death of a President</i> and all the newspaper
stories, indicated to her something vaguely cerebral. He was working as a
fabrication engineer then, and the after-work investigations gave him a break
from the pressure.<p>

The twentieth anniversary of the assassination, however, seemed to set him off.
His company had been downsizing, and Lyle had taken a buyout and tried to start
his own company, selling public-domain software. He had a little office in
their basement, and a lot of free time as he sat there waiting for people to
phone in orders. That was when he began to see the whole grand scheme.<p>

It didn't start with the Umbrella Man. It started with the puffs of smoke from
behind the wall. He began researching weapons and ammunition, trying to
determine what might have caused the puffs of white. He tried to be a
generalist. He tried to delve into Ferrie and Shaw. But as he studied photos
taken across the Grassy Knoll, he couldn't get his mind off the Umbrella Man.<p>

The first order of tomorrow's meeting will no doubt be the discrediting of one
Louis Witt, who came forward in the seventies to claim that he was the Umbrella
Man. He has explained himself by saying that the umbrella he opened on that
sunny day was symbolic of appeasement, a reference to Chamberlain's rolling
over for Hitler on that fateful day in Munich. But trashing Witt is always a
prelude to the real talks, like an invocation. Lyle once got Witt on the phone,
years ago, with a tape recorder running and a suction-cup microphone on the
receiver. He shouted at Witt until the man, after demanding to know how Lyle
got his phone number, hung up. Deborah remembers the redness of Lyle's face
after that call, his wild-eyed look; she remembers it because he has it now,
thinking of Litwak. Deborah has put on her nightgown and gotten into bed. In
the corner Lyle is still going over his documents.<p>

"Honey," she says, "come to bed. You need to rest."<p>

<p>
<br>
	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/W-small.gif" align=left 
	height=44 alt="W"></font>HEN she awakens, a little before six, Lyle is still
at 	the table, in his
clothes. Has he slept and then gotten up again? "Lyle, are you all right?"<p>

"I'm fine," he says. "I'm ready." He stands up and his hands move toward his
back, which stiffens when he does these all-night sessions. "I just need a
shower," he says.<p>

She knows he won't go down for breakfast, so while he's in the shower, she
orders room service. He's still in the bathroom, shaving, when the food comes,
scrambled eggs and toast and orange juice and coffee. In a hotel bathrobe, he
eats quickly, without talking, and then he gets dressed, knotting a
geometrically patterned tie that exactly matches Kennedy's on that day: the
Kansas City convention had a guy in a booth selling these ties and PT-109 tie
clips, both of which sold out almost immediately.<p>

"In case you need to know, I'm going to go to Macy's today," Deborah says.
"Then Bergdorf Goodman. I don't want you to worry."<p>

Distracted, Lyle says, "Where's my umbrella?"<p>

"I don't know," Deborah says.<p>

"It was right here on the table. When I went in the shower."<p>

"I never touched it, honey."<p>

"I don't believe this," Lyle says.<p>

He looks all around the room, in the closet, under the bed, and in the
bathroom. "It's gone," he says.<p>

"It's got to be here somewhere," Deborah says.<p>

"It's not, can't you see that?" he says. He stands, rubbing his bottom lip with
his fingertips, and then he says, "Who brought the food?"<p>

"Oh, Lyle, come on."<p>

"Is there any other explanation?" he says. <i>"Is there any other
explanation?"</i><p>

"I don't know," she says.<p>

"Now I have to find a new umbrella!" he says. He goes to the table, takes his
plastic Luger, and puts it in his waistband at the small of his back. He puts
on his suit coat and hefts his briefcase to his side, and then he's gone.<p>


Within ten minutes Deborah finds the umbrella, underneath the folded-back
bedcovers. She realizes that the boy from room service had to move the umbrella
from the table, so that he could put the tray of food there. She finishes
dressing, and on the way out she takes the umbrella with her.<p>

In the lobby of the hall where the convention is taking place, she finds the
registration-and-information table. "I'm trying to give this to someone," she
says, holding out the umbrella.<p>

"We don't go for pranks," the man at the table says. He is wearing sunglasses
and has a beige wire snaking from his collar up into his ear.<p>

"No, honestly," she says. "My husband thought he had lost it, but it's found.
He really may need it."<p>

"Listen," the man says, "there are a hundred and ten people in that room, and I
can count on one hand the number of people who walked in <i>without</i> an
umbrella. If he needs to use one, he has plenty to choose from."<p>

"No," she says. "He needs this one."<p>

The man jumps to his feet. "Hey," he says, "we don't want any funny business
here."<p>

<p>
<br>
	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/I-small.gif" align=left 
	height=44 alt=I></font>N Bergdorf Goodman she decides that she shouldn't 	have thrown Lyle's umbrella
in a trash can, but she knows she'll never get it back. She walked from the
information table out through the lobby; on the street she saw that the day was
cool and brilliant, and, disgusted, she relieved herself of the umbrella. She
knows she'll never hear the end of it if she doesn't admit it wasn't stolen.<p>

She likes crowded places, and moves through the store slowly, rustling against
passing shoppers as they squeeze by islands of merchandise. She can't help
thinking what Lyle often asks when they are in a well-known place: "Can you
imagine what it was like here on that day?" Lyle's memory of all that is
sharply defined. He grew up in Delaware, and he recalls being on the broad lawn
outside his high school gym, playing touch football, when he heard. <p>

Deborah told Lyle that she doesn't remember what she was doing when she heard,
and that threw him into a rage. Then he came up with a restyled theory: she was
in shock. Actually she remembers precisely what she was doing. She was on a
first date with her hottest flame ever, Westy Dodd. They were sitting in a soda
shop in her home town of Bradford, Pennsylvania. Someone, some face from her
high school homeroom, ran into the place and said, "Somebody shot the
President!" If she had a reaction, its intensity has faded in memory, and what
she remembers is the brief thought that this date would be ruined. Then
Westy--his slicked-down blond hair gleaming in the fall light--reached across
and took her hands in his, and said, "Let's choose not to be unhappy." She
remembers thinking, <i>That's all right with me</i>. By nightfall, as the
nation mourned, she was making out with Westy in his father's Rambler. Their
romance lasted only a month, but by then everyone had adjusted, and she had
seemed to just float above the sadness.<p>

Of course, everyone has memories, and hers, she knows, matter only in light of
Lyle's passions. The memory is one that would otherwise have been lost, or
filed away, or blunted.<p>
<p>
<br>
<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/A-small.gif" align=left 
	height=44 alt=A></font>FTER her shopping is completed, she takes a cab	back to the
hotel. When she comes into their room, the person she sees is Fritz. He's a
thin and graying man, probably about her age. He's sitting on the edge of the
bed, holding a plastic cup filled with ice and his usual Dewar's.<p>

Greg is at the table, staring at the television. He is a fat kid of twenty-one
or twenty-two whom Deborah and Lyle met in Kansas City. He has come over to the
assassination theorists from the <i>Star Trek</i> crowd, he says, because he
has come to understand how the assassination is the root of almost everything
important, including <i>Star Trek</i>, which he now understands was an enormous
homage to Kennedy and his vision.<p>

"Hail to the Queen!" Fritz says, raising his cup. Greg, in a T-shirt that rides
above his beltline, revealing pale and copious flesh, simply says, "Deborah."<p>

"Your husband struck fear in the hearts of the Darts," Fritz says. The Darts
are an Umbrella faction that contends that the umbrella on the Grassy Knoll was
actually a clever weapon that shot tiny poisonous darts. Lyle's theory is that
the umbrella, which is seen open and sideways in most photographs, was held
high on the shaft as the Umbrella Man brought a pistol to eye level, to achieve
accuracy in the shot that hit Kennedy's neck--the wound that was passed off by
conspiracy-connected doctors as an exit wound. Lyle believes that should the
real umbrella ever be found, it would have a small hole in its fabric, precut
to accommodate the gun's muzzle. The lack of that hole in Louis Witt's umbrella
proves that Witt was not the Umbrella Man.<p>

"Where's Lyle?" Deborah says.<p>

"In the shower," Fritz says. "Then we're going to dinner."<p>

"Oh," Deborah says.<p>

Lyle is just coming out of the bathroom, wrapped in a towel, carrying his own
drink. "I didn't think you'd mind, Deb," he says. "We have so much to
review."<p>

"I made reservations for only two," she says.<p>

"Already changed them," Lyle says.<p>

But they don't get in at the restaurant they've chosen, because Greg refuses to
wear a tie, putatively on principle. They end up at a vaguely seedy diner a few
blocks away. The place serves beer, and the men resume their drinking. Lyle is
still glowing. He has not yet even mentioned the lost umbrella, to Deborah's
relief. The three men fall into a rehash of the day's events.<p>

"Can you believe them?" Lyle says of the Darts. "I mean, what's their
problem?"<p>

"They're crackpots," Fritz says.<p>

"I mean, why not just make a big joke out of the whole thing?" Lyle says. "Why
not just mock the man's legacy?"<p>

Fritz turns to Deborah. "You should have seen your old man in there. He took
the floor away from the panel. People were listening, and I could hear some of
them whispering, `Who <i>is</i> that?' Lyle just knocked them dead. His
reconstruction of events was so--logical! They just sat stunned when he was
finished."<p>

"The Darts were met, and found wanting," Greg says.<p>

But Lyle isn't talking much.<p>

"Honey?" Deborah says. "Are you all right?"<p>

Lyle allows himself a semi-grin. "I'm fine," he says.<p>

"It's that Litwak that's got him worked up," Fritz says.<p>

"That Litwak's an odd duck."<p>

"What did he do?" Deborah says.<p>

"He was just <i>there</i>, hanging at the edges," Fritz says. "Very suspicious,
you know? Very weird."<p>

"Is he a Dart?"<p>

<img src="Fictionb.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

"He's not anything," Greg says, in a nearly annoyed way. "Don't you see the
point? An unknown man appears, by coincidence, as Lyle Asay is checking in,
coincidentally bumps into Mrs. Asay on the elevator, proceeds to grill her
about what she knows, coincidentally appears at a convention as Mr. Asay
reveals what may be the key to the entire conspiracy."<p>

"He didn't grill me," Deborah says.<p>

"They know that approach doesn't work," Fritz says.<p>

"They're very sophisticated."<p>

"What are you trying to say?" Deborah says.<p>

"He could be very dangerous," Greg says. Lyle nods gravely.<p>

"Oh, come on," Deborah says.<p>

"I'd replace that plastic Luger with the real thing," Fritz says.<p>

"Most women just don't get these kinds of things," Greg says.<p>

Deborah says nothing more, and the others quiet down and slowly sip from their
beer glasses. They part cursorily on the street; walking back toward their
hotel, Deborah says, "I mean, Lyle, my God!"<p>

"They're my friends," he says. "They're looking out for me."<p>

"Do you really think you're in some kind of danger?"<p>

"Man checks in under an assumed name, comes literally out of nowhere," Lyle
says.<p>

"He came from somewhere," she says. "Everybody comes from somewhere. I think he
said Trenton."<p>

"Yes," Lyle says. "But there is one key fact, an indisputable thing: an
umbrella stolen from a hotel room on a cloudless day. Explain that one."<p>

<p>
<br>
<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif" align=left 
	height=44 alt="T"></font>HEY walk the rest of the way without speaking. In the hotel room Lyle
undresses and gets in bed. "I didn't sleep last night," he says, and then he is
asleep. It's not even nine o'clock. She wants to put on the television, but
she's afraid it will wake him. She takes the room key from his pants, rides the
elevator to the lobby, and sits on a couch facing the front entrance. She is in
New York and wants to watch the world go by.<p>

After an hour or more has passed, she sees Litwak coming in. He is small and
precise, dressed with fastidiousness. He sees her, smiles, and then
approaches.<p>

"Your husband was quite marvelous today," he says.<p>

"He'll be happy to hear that," Deborah says. "I told him we'd spoken, and he
wanted to invite you to join us for dinner. But you weren't registered here."<p>

"I am with my friend Stein," he says. "We split the costs, so that Mrs. Stein
won't think we're being frivolous." He turns and signals a man who is hovering
nearby. "Bill, come meet Mrs. Asay." Stein is also elderly. "We're both retired
from the transit authority, down in Philadelphia," Litwak says. "We share an
interest, and decided this convention would be quite a lot of fun."<p>

"And has it been?" she says.<p>

"Beyond our expectations," Stein says. "So many fascinating theories."<p>

"You know, they all spy on each other," Deborah says. The two old men look at
each other approvingly.<p>

"I was a numismatist," Stein says. "But that crowd has gotten unforgivably
dull. Besides, looking at coins strains my eyes now. Otto brought me in from
the cold."<p>

"We are discussing our own umbrella theory," Stein says. "But of course we
can't reveal it. Perhaps next year."<p>

"I'm eager to hear it," Deborah says.<p>

A while after the men have gotten on the elevator, Deborah rises and makes her
way up to the room. As she comes through the door, Lyle starts up, staring from
his side of the bed, but then his eyes roll back and he's asleep again. She
realizes in these moments that both of them have begun to age. Deborah knows
that the vacation will get better, as they always do. By tomorrow Lyle will be
more like himself.<p>

She thinks of Lyle as he was, as he must have been, a boy racing across a
field, waiting for a football to descend into his hands, a boy only moments
away from hearing the news. He will never shake the idea of a conspiracy; it
informs his days; but in that moment of youthful self-absorption the crime was
not against a man he never met but against the person Lyle was and could have
been. Lyle, the young man going old, now rolls over on his side, and she can
hear only his soft snore against the blankets. What pictures form in his head
she cannot say. <p>

	USY night," Byron said, over the noise, when Brenda set his beer on the
bar in front of him.<p>

"For a weeknight," she agreed. "Hear you found that little deaf boy."<p>

"Yup," he said, and raised the bottle in a mock toast.<p>

Brenda gave the bar a pat. "On the house--excuse me," she said, and went to
wait on somebody else. He watched her go, sorry, vaguely and not for the first
time, that he wasn't the least bit in love with her. She reminded him
pleasantly of a girl in Texas, almost fifteen years before.<p>

"Hey, Doatze," Mike Connor called from down the bar.<p>

Byron nodded back at him, and then at the other men with him, who raised hands
or beers in greeting.<p>

Most weeknights when Byron came in, he could stand at the bar and joke with
Brenda for three beers and be interrupted only once or twice--the place stayed
that quiet. But tonight, as if the tornado two days ago, or last night's
search, had changed even the Rainbow, the place was so full he could hardly
hear himself think.<p>

Brenda went behind the bar again, uncapped a fresh beer, and set it in front of
him. "It's on Frenchie," she said, pointing toward the back of the barroom.<p>

"I'll be damned," Byron said, because Frenchie'd never bought anybody a beer,
and that made Brenda laugh, so he said, "I better get out of here before
chickens grow teeth."<p>

"Oh, you," Brenda said, taking a little slap at his shoulder.<p>

Then somebody called her. Byron caught Frenchie's eye, raised the second beer,
and nodded his thanks.<p>

Maybe it was that--thanking somebody he didn't like for something he didn't
want--or maybe it was the noise in a place he preferred quiet, but he'd come
for something else, and he didn't know what. He took another swallow and gave
up. Next thing he knew he'd be feeling sorry for himself, and even as he
thought that, he thought of Maude Nash and how she'd made fun of him the night
before last in her kitchen. What a clean, surprising thing talking with her had
been. And she didn't remind him at all of that old lost chance in Texas.<p>

He pulled a dollar from his pocket and tucked it under his bottle. He hadn't
planned on giving Brenda a blow-by-blow of the search, but there were a few things he'd have liked the chance to say,
maybe just to hear how they sounded. And he sure didn't want to say them to
Frenchie, or Mike, or any of the rest of them.<p>

"'Night," he called to Brenda, and she looked up, surprised for a second. Then
she waved, and he waved and left.<p>

He had spent the day tuning his truck's engine, so when he turned the key, it
started right up, and now he tried to take some satisfaction in that, sitting
there, listening to how smooth it was. But even as he listened, he grew aware
that he was paying attention to listening, not to the engine, so he pulled the
truck around and headed back toward town. His own house, which he had built
himself, of stone, and where he lived alone, was a mile in the other direction,
but he wasn't ready for that much quiet just yet, and he wasn't sure what he
did want.<p>

For a long minute at the four-way stop he considered turning down East Main and seeing if Maude was home. It was
still early, maybe eight o'clock. The night of the tornado, night before last,
she'd called him into her house to take shelter from the rain, bullied and
bossed him into her kitchen, and sat there talking with him about nothing for
hours. He'd known who she was for years, but this was the first time he'd
talked to her, and when he left, she'd offered to lend him her umbrella. If
he'd taken it--well, then he could have returned it, and she'd ask about the
boy, and he could say this and that. And then? He remembered her strong,
laughing face there in the candlelight in the middle of the night: the
electricity out, she in her bathrobe and he in his socks. They'd talked and had
a good time. No foolishness about Maude Nash, candlelight or not. He smiled.
"Smart woman," he said aloud. She had a funny way of tilting her head when she
was listening, and the candlelight had shown the white in her dark hair, had
softened the small scar that split one eyebrow and made her look critical in
the daylight.<p>

All those requirements for romance had been satisfied, and what he'd felt, what
they'd both felt, was simply comfortable. So he hadn't taken the umbrella, and
he knew why, and she knew why. So he didn't have it to return, and that was
that.<p>

He turned east anyway, and saw that the lights were out in her house, and then
he turned his truck around at the high school and drove past Nobel Aldrich's
house, where Aldrich's car was in the driveway and the lights were on, upstairs
and down. Man's got sense, Byron thought.<p>

The night before, he and Nobel had been one of the search teams assigned to
Clayborne Woods, the team that took the old logging road in, the team that
found the boy and walked him out of the woods. Nobel had seen what Byron saw,
and had had the sense to stay home tonight.<p>

<i>Meaning I don't</i>, he thought then. Celebrating, for crying out loud (he
was thinking now of all the men at the Rainbow). And why not: a five-year-old
child had been lost; the men of the town had gotten together a search; they'd
found the kid and he was fine. Why not celebrate?<p>

Because. If Kyle had been a normal little kid and they'd found him crying, if
he or Nobel had picked him up and said, "Hey there, little fellow, it's okay.
Let's go find your momma, okay?" and held a bandanna so he could blow his nose,
all right: go ahead and celebrate. The other fellows probably didn't see the
difference, and no reason why they should. But he and Nobel Aldrich had been
there, and that's why he wasn't celebrating, and why he felt a little ashamed
that he'd gone to the Rainbow in the first place, and admired Nobel Aldrich for
staying home.<p>

<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/I-small.gif"
 align=left height=44 alt="I"></font>	T was a mild night for September, 
 moonlit, as the previous night had been, the night of the search. When he got home, his barren Holstein cow stood
near the board fence, one hind leg delicately bent. He walked across the yard
and reached over the fence to scratch the white center of her broad, hard
forehead, taking in the good, deep, familiar smell of hay, manure, and cow.
"Might as well tell you," he said, grinning to think what Maude would say about
that, but then something like the upward swoop of being in love scooped into
his stomach and throat, and for a second he thought he was going to cry.<p>

He stroked the cow's black ear, running it through his fisted hand, feeling how
warm and thick and tough it was, the coarse hairs distinct against his palm,
and she didn't shake him off. The moonlight lay on the roof of the shed. "I
guess all I was ready for was not to find him," he said. "I probably expected
we'd hear the signal that somebody else had. Or that nobody would, and the
search would get to be one of those long, ugly ones, and next spring his body
would show up. But I didn't expect to find him sitting there like that with
that dummy." He rubbed his thumb against the grain of the soft inside hairs of
the cow's ear, smoothed them, and then let the ear slide free. He leaned his
forearms on the fence and clasped his hands loosely together.<p>

"So it made me feel strange. Right then, and it just keeps on. I've been trying
to figure out what he was thinking. I don't know anything else to do about it.
Probably the smart thing to do is talk to Nobel, see what his read on it was, a
man with kids of his own and all." <p>

He shrugged, looking past the cow's bony back. "Seems stupid, though. Don't
know why, but it does." He sighed, opened his hands, and looked at his palms.
"You take this boy, deaf and dumb since he was born, and here he is, four miles
from home in the woods, lost, it's getting dark, and he's sitting there with a
dummy. What does he think it is? Ventriloquists. They pretend they're not
talking, make you believe the dummy's talking. He can't talk, can't hear. What
does he think--it's just a doll or something?"<p>

He stood up straight and looked the cow in the eye. "And he wasn't playing,
either. That's the thing."<p>

The cow switched her tail slowly and shifted her weight.<p>

"He wasn't playing. I never saw anybody more serious than that boy was."<p>

Byron rubbed his hand over his jaw while the moon hung steady and the cow stood
still.<p>

"Here's how I figure it," he said. "Here's what I think happened."<p>

And then he was silent for a long minute, seeing in his mind how the boy and
his mother would have been just sitting around in Ike's yard, a nice day,
sunshine, the boy probably with a toy truck, Louise having a glass of tea and
chatting, Ike opening a box somebody had just dropped off.<p>

"The boy, Kyle, he's watching, curious, even though it's the kind of stuff Ike
does all the time--unpacking the junk people bring him, the leftovers of their
yard sales, whatever.<p>

"Sure he's curious. You've got to think what the Trash and Treasure Trailer
looks like to a kid. This fat old trailer just full of all that kind of junk
Ike had. Old hats, a birdcage, trunks full of busted toys, rusty tools."<p>

Byron smiled and leaned on the fence again, easy. "You know, one time when he
was little, Will told me that when he grew up, Dad would grow down." He smiled
again, thinking of Will big and Dad little, of Will, his brother, when they'd
still been boys together. "Well," he said softly. "Well, so kids figure things
out the way it makes sense to them. And maybe it seemed to Kyle that when he
grew up, he would get the trailer, get to keep all that stuff. Or maybe he had
some money from birthdays or something, and he figured he could buy some of
Ike's stuff."<p>

He sighed. "If he knows about buying. That's the thing--you can't tell what he
knows, how he figures things out."<p>

Byron thought again of Kyle in the dark woods--when they turned the flashlights
on him and he froze, and then stood up, not scrambling up like a scared kid but
getting to his feet, almost like a man would.<p>

The cow sighed, her stomachs sounding.<p>

"Anyway. So Ike opens the box. It's got some other junk in it--maybe old
Christmas decorations, curtains--but then Ike lifts out this dummy." Byron
could see the dummy's face as he had seen it in the woods, menacing and tragic,
could smell the old wet leaves. He tried hard to imagine it in sunlight, as
Kyle would have seen it, with his mother nearby, nothing scary about it, and
not knowing what it was for. <p>

"It's a boy, wearing a brown tweed jacket and brown trousers, and it's almost
as big as Kyle. Ike holds it up, and its arms and legs dangle down, and he
gives it a little shake. He says, 'Look at this,' and Louise looks and she says
she hates it--'I hate those things,' she says. 'They're weird.'<p>

"Ike says it's a collector's item. That's how Ike is. He'd say that. He'd say,
'It looks a little like that what's his name--Charlie McCarthy.' And Louise
wouldn't buy that. Charlie McCarthy wore a top hat. This one's ugly, and it's
got a smart-aleck face, and its hair's all ratty. But Ike puts his hand into
the hole in the dummy's back and makes it blink.<p>

"And the kid doesn't know what they're saying, but he's watching now. Ike makes
the mouth open and shut, like he's the ventriloquist, and he screws his face
all up and says, 'Hey there, kid--what you lookin' at?'<p>

"Louise says 'Don't,' but it's too late--Ike makes the dummy wink at Kyle. It's
too late. Ike makes the dummy look back at Louise, makes it say, 'Whatza
matter, lady--you don't like dummies?' and Louise says, 'Don't use that word,'
and Ike goes red, because he didn't mean anything, and he says, 'No offense,'
and he takes his hand out and puts the thing down on the grass. And it lies
there for the rest of the afternoon, while they unpack the other boxes and have
another glass of tea.<p>

"Maybe they notice how the boy lies there near it; maybe they don't. Maybe they
should have known right off when he disappeared that he'd gone after it, but
they're not really paying attention, maybe. It's got to be easy to ignore a kid
who doesn't talk to you and can't hear when you talk to him."<p>

The cow shook her head, began to chew, and stepped closer to the fence.<p>

"I don't know--Louise loves him, no doubt there, and she's a good mother. Maybe
she did notice, and then the tornado just shook everything up so it slipped her
mind. So when he came up missing, she thought he'd been stolen.<p>

"In a way, I guess, he had been. Lying there on the hot grass, watching that
dummy lying there on the hot grass."<p>

Byron stroked the cow's dusty neck absently, seeing in his mind the oddly rough
skin of the dummy's face, the heavily painted eyebrows, the full smirking lips,
how the flashlight had picked up the shine of the paint and made the eyes
glitter.<p>

"He knew the dummy wasn't alive. I'm sure about that. But there's something
about those things. He'd probably be careful not to stare too hard, for fear it
would turn and look at him again. Maybe he felt kind of sorry for it." He
rubbed his palm over the bony top of the cow's head. "Maybe one time his mother
took her fingers and lifted the corners of his mouth to make him smile, and he
kept his face like that, like the dummy's was now, all the time they were in
some place where he knew his mother wanted him to smile, and he remembered how
sad he'd been. So maybe he lay there on the grass and thought how he'd like to
push the dummy's grin down, so the face could relax."<p>

The cow lowered her head and stepped away from his hand. The moon had moved,
and Byron was thinking about the time Mom had done that, had not said a word,
just forced his mouth into a smirk, and he'd kept it that way, all through the
long afternoon of his sister Kate's getting married. Damned if he knew why she
had, to this day.<p>

"That's probably just me, you're right," he said to the cow's profile. "What
the hell do I know what he thought? I don't even know what I think half the
time. And here I am, talking to a cow--not much better off than him, am I?"<p>

Byron dusted his palms against each other and put his hands in his pockets.
"Talking to your cow, By," he said, and tried to laugh, to dodge the return of
that sad, sweet feeling.<p>

"What you need . . . ," he said, and didn't bother to finish. He got into his
truck again and headed back to the Rainbow. It would have to be emptied out by
now, probably almost nine o'clock. <i>Better than nothing</i>, he thought; and
then, because he was a decent and honest man, he thought, <i>No offense</i>,
for Brenda had always been as nice to him as she could be.<p>

<br>

	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/A-small.gif"
 align=left height=44 alt="A"></font>S he drove, he thought, <i>That's me 
 too, not the kid</i>.	But he couldn't stop imagining Kyle lying in bed in the dark, being little, thinking
of how next time they went across the road to the trailer, he would find the
dummy and refuse to be parted from it. He'd hug it, hug that scratchy brown
jacket, and the body would be against his, just sticks inside the clothes. That
would give him a strange feeling in his stomach, but he would hold on. And when
his mother carried him home, her throat moving with talk, he would bring the
dummy with him.<p>

The boy imagining theft: While Ike was asleep, he could look both ways and go
across the road and go into the trailer and find the dummy, take its odd body
in his arms, and carry it home. It wouldn't be too heavy. And then he would
have it in his room.<p>

And thinking of frightening his mother: He had seen Ike put his hand into the
dummy's back, and if he had the dummy in his room, he could figure out how it
worked. When he had figured it out, he would go into the room where his mother
was sleeping and shake her by the shoulder, and when she opened her eyes, he
would put the face of the dummy in front of her face and chop its toothy mouth
open and shut and scare her. Then he felt very bad and frightened himself,
because he knew how warm she smelled in the morning in her bed, and he imagined
that when she got scared, she might cry; she had cried once, and he had cried
too. Now, alone in the bed, he shook his head. No, if he had that thing, he
wouldn't scare her with it. She didn't like it, he knew that much. And she did
like him.<p>

<i>But none of that's anything but me</i>, Byron thought, and he didn't even
put on his turn signal, because there were so many cars and pickups still in
the Rainbow's parking lot. He drove on into town, listening to his truck's
motor and trying not to think of Kyle thinking about the dummy's head, the
face. How that rough, shiny skin would feel to his tongue if he got a chance to
lick it. How cool and hard the grinning cheek would be against his own. Byron
said aloud, "Knock it off," and wished that he had a radio in the truck. He
drove past the feed store, past Poole's Ford dealership with the plastic
pennants, past the Mobil station and the dark doughnut shop, and on into the
center of town, where Maude Nash was just locking the library and coming down
the steps. He pulled over on the wrong side of the street and called softly to
her, "Ride?"<p>

And there she was, Maude, not startled or even answering, just coming around to
the other side of the truck in an ordinary way, the truck's headlights making
the white flowers on her full skirt glow for a second as she passed. He leaned
over and pushed the door open for her, thinking how strange it was that he
wasn't worried about whether she'd have trouble with the high step into the
cab--that he wasn't worried about a thing. She slid her books onto the seat and
climbed up and in, slamming the door with a strong pull. She had on lipstick
and her hair was wavier, combed back more carefully, but her eyes were no
different. They still looked right at him, and in the dim cab light the funny
eyebrow asked only the gentlest, most patient question.<p>

"Nice night for walking," she said, observed, greeted.<p>

And so, even though he could smell faint perfume and a slight nostalgic scent
of the library, paste and paper and wood, he could say, as if they'd been
having easy conversations for years, "Like to show you something, if you've got
time. Out past--well, out past where Ike's Trash and Treasure used to be."<p>

She nodded, an ordinary nod, simple, turning her face to look out the
windshield, as if they were already on their way. "Where you found little
Kyle," she said.<p>

"Yes," he said. He put the truck in gear and drove.<p>

After they'd passed her house and the high school and the old depot, she said,
"I'd wondered about that," but not in a way that needed an answer, so he drove
on. The two miles from the edge of the village to the lights in Ike's house
were quiet except for the truck's smooth engine and the tires on the asphalt.
The moonlight showed up once the houses thinned out.<p>

"Looks funny without the trailer," she said--and it did, Ike's little house
oddly naked to the road. The space in front of it, where the trailer had sat
for twenty-some years until the tornado came and turned it inside out and upside down, looked
too small for anything to have been there. Now only some chunks of twisted
metal and some broken glass were left. Even the cinder blocks it had sat on
were gone.<p>

"It does," Byron said. "Pretty lucky it missed both houses." He slowed and put
on his signal a quarter mile past Ike's. "Little bumpy here," he said,
apologetically, and eased the truck off the shoulder and into Newton's
cornfield. The headlights showed the neat rows of cornstalk stubble angling off
from the wagon track.<p>

Maude said, "I imagine the search would have been harder if it had happened
before the corn was cut," and Byron, who hadn't thought of that, could see what
she meant: acres and acres of corn whispering, taller than the men, dense,
impossible to search. Just thinking of it, he felt again the small panic of the
night before, when he and Nobel had started back with the boy between them and
he had for an instant believed that they were headed wrong, that the trees
should have thinned by now.<p>

<i>A lot of luck in this whole thing</i>, he thought of saying, the sentence in
his head, but he didn't. He shifted down into second, his headlights showing
the trees a quarter mile ahead, and said nothing. He brought the truck to a
stop ten feet from the first trees, shifted into neutral, put on the hand
brake, and turned on his high beams.<p>

<br>

<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif"
 align=left height=44 alt="T"></font>HE trees here were mostly 
 young maples and skinny walnuts and wild
crabapples. Behind them were older maples and a few dogwoods and oaks and
hemlocks--an ordinary woods, with a path in and some honeysuckle and probably
poison ivy in the undergrowth. But things hung from the trees, things that had
never hung from trees before.<p>

A bent black umbrella, its handle carved like a duck's head. A limp embroidered
felt sombrero, rinsed pink, and a huge green lampshade, one side caved in. A
blue tablecloth draped like bunting from one tree to another, gold threads in
it sparkling in the headlights. A white-plastic doll stroller, a dish drainer,
a flowered bathrobe hung as neatly from a spruce branch as if it had been on a
bathroom door, a throw pillow with its stuffing dangling like a cloud, a work
boot, part of a fishing rod.<p>

And on the path itself a gray portable typewriter, driven half into the ground;
the top of a pressure cooker, its round gauge like a monocle; silverware; a
glass doorknob; the round wire cage from a Bingo set.<p>

All this in the moonlight, in the headlights.<p>

"Good God," Maude said.<p>

It had been sundown by the time he and Nobel had reached here, and dusky among
the trees. A trace of fog had risen along the ground, and they had both paused
right there at the edge of the trees, touching their flashlights before they
went in. First thing, he had stepped on a sodden stuffed animal and started
back, feeling its softened shape as flesh under his foot. And then, seeing what
it really was, a light-blue bear or dog with a limp ribbon around its neck,
he'd gone on two or three steps before stumbling against the typewriter. Nobel
had said, "Have to watch our step in here," and turned on his flashlight, even
though it was plenty light enough to see, if they paid attention. They'd gone
in along the trail maybe half a mile before the things the tornado had flung
out of the Treasure Trailer began to thin out, began to be only a rag here and
there, a baseball cap, a torn paper fan.<p>

"He followed the things," Byron said. "Like they were a trail he was on.
Clues." That wasn't at all what he had meant to say, and for the first time
since he had pulled over by the library, he was uneasy. What was he doing,
anyway? Farther down the path, he knew, lay marbles and the broken wooden cigar
box they must have been in, a swollen book of piano music, a plaid sneaker. Off
to the right, somewhere in the undergrowth, where he had kicked it in a reflex
of fear, was a snake-like bicycle tire.<p>

But Maude said, "Like Hansel and Gretel," quietly, the shock gone
out of her voice, and Byron said, "Yes--like that. Hunting that dummy."<p>

"Dummy?"<p>

As they watched, the truck's motor humming, a broken gilt picture frame slid
from a high place in a hemlock and hit the ground, separating into slats.<p>

"We didn't know about it when we were looking. It was an old ventriloquist's
dummy from the Trash and Treasure, blown out with everything else. He was
looking for it. Nobel Aldrich and I went in along this trail about two miles,
slow and quiet, listening for him, looking with our flashlights. Then we
decided to come back--to spread out to either side of the trail about ten or
twelve yards and come back that way."<p>

That far in, the ground fog had been gone, and Byron had kept feeling that wet
dog or whatever it was he'd stepped on, the weird weakening of his leg muscles
as his foot hit it, had kept waiting for the real snake that the bicycle tire
hadn't been. It had been so quiet that he wondered now if he'd been thinking
anything at all. He'd listened to the noise he made and the noise Nobel made,
invisible twenty-five yards away except for the flashlight now and then.<p>

"We were walking along as quiet as we could in there, trying to listen for him
if he was crying or walking--not much else we could do," Byron said. He
couldn't even begin to explain the kind of quiet it had been, as if the silence
were a transparent absence, a clear waiting shape made by the crossings of
branches and stems. Or what had happened in his throat and stomach when he
heard the sound, how hard it had been to force his brain and then his mouth,
tongue, throat, to call, "Nobel?" Nobel had stopped, and the silence had been
sharp-edged, like held breath, even after Nobel called back, "Yeah?" and Byron called, "I
think we got something."<p>

"I heard this sound--this quiet little <i>tup tup tup </i>sound. Sort of
wooden-sounding, not like a bird or an insect but steady, and then it would
stop for a few seconds and start up again." The headlights made the yellow
glass eye in the umbrella handle gleam. "I looked over to the right and I saw
something move and then I saw him sitting there by a big old maple with this
ventriloquist's dummy."<p>

The boy had seemed to glow softly, his bare arms and legs, his blond head. All
that paleness there in the dusk beside that dark old tree. He was sitting cross-legged,
half toward the path, holding the dummy facing him, so that Byron had seen the
dummy's face before he saw the boy's. The dummy's eyes had glittered as its
thick lips opened and no sound came out. Nobel had come up beside Byron then,
his flashlight, like Byron's, pointing down, as if they both knew that they had
found something not to shine a light on.<p>

"It was the strangest thing I ever saw. He had his hand in the back of the
dummy, and what I'd heard was the dummy's mouth clopping shut--open, shut,
open, shut." Byron moved his hand, flat-fingered, to show how the mouth had
gone, but it was wrong--it was the silhouette of a quacking duck, silly. He put
his hand back on the steering wheel. "The boy was making the dummy move its
mouth for a while--like for a sentence, maybe--and then he moved his mouth the
same way." Something small and dark, mouse or mole, rolled like a dustball
across the path. "Up and down, up and down." How empty the boy had made his
face to get his jaw to move that way.<p>

Maude drew in a breath and let it out without saying anything, and Byron
couldn't tell whether he was glad or not that she hadn't spoken. But he knew
that the ease he'd felt with her the other night, sitting in her kitchen and
deciding he'd had too good a time to spoil it by making suggestions, and
watching her deciding the same thing--that ease was gone. To keep the sad
lonesomeness of knowing that from filling him up, he started talking again,
saying random things, looking at the junk hanging in the trees and sparkling on
the path.<p>

"I never knew Louise to speak of. Knew her dad some years ago, but I didn't
know she was back in town. Ike said they'd been out looking for an hour, and
she just kept calling and calling, like the boy could hear her. Ike was out of
patience, I think, but I bet if he'd been looking alone he'd have been calling
too. You feel stupid not calling--have to make yourself not do it."<p>

He could feel Maude looking at him now, watching his face by the dim dashboard
light, but he kept his eyes on the round gleam of the pressure-cooker gauge and
his hands on the wheel. "First thing, there's this tornado, and no way Louise
could explain it to him, make him understand why all of a sudden they're
sitting down in the basement and it's dark at suppertime. Supper's on the
table, and they're sitting on the basement floor. He can't hear the wind. I
don't know, maybe she's got some way of talking to him. He's five, got to have
figured something out by now--maybe he knows about storms from the vibrations.
Maybe when the tornado went over and picked that trailer up and threw it, he
knew exactly what was going on. Maybe he knows people talk and hear and he
doesn't, but I keep thinking about it, and I can't make it make sense. It's
like one of us suspected that other people could do something with their knees
that meant something, or their elbows, that we couldn't do and couldn't even
imagine--"<p>

Maude laughed then--not her big roaring laugh, that he'd heard at her kitchen
table when they'd been joking about Frenchie's skinny wife, but a gentle little
laugh.<p>

"Sorry," she said, but she was smiling. "It just sounded funny. Talking with
our elbows." She looked back out, and now Byron watched her, seeing the
delicate skin beside her eyes, the deep waves of her hair, the way her eyebrows
moved when she talked. "You know, the first ventriloquists were
fortune-tellers,"she said. "Prophets. Probably Moses was a ventriloquist--the
burning bush and all that." She glanced at him and then away, and in Byron's
chest the loop of sadness turned and sprang, arched near his throat. <p>
<br>

<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif"
 align=left height=44 alt="T"></font>	WO nights ago, in her kitchen, a moment had come, 	a little past midnight,
when they'd looked at each other, clear and simple, and seen that they weren't
in love. They hadn't said it, but that's what it was, and so she'd offered her
umbrella, and he'd said thank you, no. And now this was another moment. Byron
drew a long breath, looked out at the spangled blue cloth in the trees, and
said the one thing he hadn't thought.<p>

"I think he was in love with it," he said.<p>

Out of the corner of his eye he saw her hand lift itself from her lap in a
little flutter, not even close to high enough to touch her throat. But that's
the gesture it was, stopped, held down.<p>

But all she said was "So. When you found him . . . ," which brought back the
boy and the heavy-lidded eyes of the dummy, the pale yellow of the flashlight beam. And Byron said, "It
was just so private. But he--" Then he had to stop, had to put both his hands
over his eyes and smooth his face, down and out, feeling the roughness of his
fingertips on his eyelids, his palms on his cheeks, the day's stubble against
his palms.<p>

He and Nobel had both kept their lights down and had moved to the right, so
that they could see the boy's face before they approached. Five years old. The
sweetest mouth, that fragile neck, and the way he looked into that dummy's
eyes. The way he was waiting.<p>

"I don't know how to describe it," he said. "For just a couple of seconds I got
to see him working at it--looking into that dummy's eyes and moving his mouth.
Not like he was saying words. Just open and shut, just like the dummy's mouth
did. Open and shut. And then he saw my light and he stopped. But he kept on
looking into those eyes for a second. And I don't have any idea what he was
thinking." He ran his palms along the steering wheel. "None of my business."<p>

He turned his hands over and looked at his palms, the darkness of the palms,
the calluses. "I guess some things you can't explain," he said.<p>

Byron waited a long time, it seemed, in the humming quiet. <i>Say it</i>, he
thought, but gently, as gentle and wishful as he imagined his hand on her hair
would be if he allowed it to reach for her. He knew that if he did, if he
touched her, the thing she would say would not be, could not be, the thing he
was waiting for her to say, which could not be a thing he drew from her, with
even the gentlest touch.<p>

Maude didn't say anything. The moon went on shining, the junk in the trees hung
there, and Byron thought of how the moonlight made the white splotches on his
cow's back glow, and of how simply cheerful all those men in the Rainbow had
seemed.<p>

So Byron Doatze shifted slowly into reverse and half turned toward her so that
he could see out the back window. He met her eyes, and saw how sad and steady
they were, and how set her mouth was, the strong line of her jaw. He kept one
hand on the wheel and the other on the back of the seat, and he said, "He stood
up like a man would. He still had his hand in the back of the dummy, and then
he pulled his hand out, so gently, and held the dummy out to me."<p>

She nodded then, and he saw her mouth soften, and to keep from doing anything
else, to keep from having to decide what that meant, he looked behind the truck
and started backing up, his eyes on the wagon track that was washed red by his
backup lights.<p>

They rode the two miles to the edge of town in the silence of the truck's tires
and the truck's motor and the knowledge of breathing. As they passed the first
houses, Byron tried to remember if he'd held the boy's hand or not. But even as
he was thinking it, he knew he was wondering about it so that he wouldn't be
waiting to hear what she said, wondering if she'd say anything at all.<p>

They were pulling up in front of her house before she cleared her throat
quietly and said, "You should have been honored."<p>

For just a second a smoothness appeared in Byron's mind, a simple smooth area,
and then he said, "Yes. I guess I should have been. But I wasn't. I gave it to
Nobel, and he carried it back." The words came out easy and surprised in spite
of how the thing he could only call his heart rose up almost to his throat, so
full and grateful that it should have choked him.<p>

She didn't say anything else, and neither did he. He was waiting again now, but
for something--for <i>what </i>it would be, not <i>if </i>it would be. So when
he had pulled on the brake, and she had opened the door, and she reached to
gather her books from the seat between them, Byron took her wrist gently and
raised her hand and kissed her palm as if it was a thing that could be done,
knowing the scent and taste of this woman's curved palm as he let her warm
wrist slide free of his loose grasp. As if it was possible, she touched his
face, her cool fingers briefly across his cheek, beside his eye, and then
carefully, delicately, across his lips.<p>

Neither of them said anything else, not even good night, as she stepped down
from the truck, but he watched her walk to her door, the moonlight picking out
those flowers on her full skirt, and when she paused there, and then turned and
raised her hand, he raised his too, and then he waited while she went in,
waited until he saw her kitchen light come on, before he drove on home, not
even thinking, not even hearing himself whistling softly over the steady hum of
his engine.

<blockquote>

	<font size=5>W</font>HEN Oliver Wendell Holmes proposed that this magazine be called <i>The
Atlantic Monthly</i>, the conceit was that the magazine, like the ocean, would
carry trade between the Old World and the New. In a statement that appeared in
the first issue of the magazine, the publishers declared, "While native writers
will receive the most solid encouragement, and will be mainly relied upon to
fill the pages of <i>The Atlantic</i>, [the editors] will not hesitate to draw
from the foreign forces at their command." <p>

The foreign forces are exemplified in this issue by the worldly and
well-traveled historian-journalist Geoffrey Wheatcroft, who in 
<A HREF="../blair/blair.htm"> "The Paradoxical
Case of Tony Blair"</a> reports on the resurgence of Britain's Labour Party.
Wheatcroft, fifty, who has written for the magazine on subjects as diverse as
Margaret Thatcher and Salman Rushdie, the Republic of Ireland and the island of
Antigua, has been affiliated over the years with some of England's best-known
publications. In the late 1970s he was a columnist for <i>The Spectator</i>,
and also its literary editor. In the following years he was first the editor of
the "Londoner's Diary" in the <i>Evening Standard </i>and then that newspaper's
opera critic. He is currently a columnist for the <i>Daily Express</i>. In the
interstices of regular employment he has written many freelance articles and
published two books--<i>The Randlords </i> (1985), a study of South African
mining magnates, and <i>Absent Friends </i> (1989), a collection of biographical
sketches. A new book, <i>The Controversy of Zion </i>, about the history of
<a href="http://www.mcs.net/~astewart/zionism.html">Zionism </a>, will be 
published this fall by Addison-Wesley. <p>

Wheatcroft covered Tony Blair, the young, astute, sometimes-hard-to-pin-down
leader of Britain's Labour Party, when Blair first stood for office, in 1982.
How does covering British politics differ from covering American politics? "In
America government is more open. In England society is more
intimate--journalists and ministers are more likely to see each other
informally at lunch clubs or at parties. I remember Dwight Macdonald's saying
how astonished he was when he first lived in London that politicians and
newspapermen and union leaders and writers all went to the same parties. That
doesn't mean the politicians are any more likely to tell you the truth, of
course." For all that, the political resonances are audible. As Wheatcroft says,
"Blair has clearly got Clinton in mind the whole time--as an example and also
as a warning." <br>

<h3>ESSENTIAL ROASTED TOMATILLO-CHIPOTLE SALSA</h3>
</CENTER>
<br>


<center>
<font size=4><I>Salsa de Chile Chipotle y Tomate Verde</I></font>
</center>

<br>
<blockquote>
<b><font size=6>T</font></b>HESE ARE THE MOST attractive salsa
flavors I know: tangy (almost
citrusy) from the tomatillos, smoky and hot from the chipotles and sweetly
aromatic from the roasted garlic. Add anything else but salt (and a pinch of
sugar if the tartness of your tomatillos seems to be prominent) and you're
gilding a naturally perfect lily. I just love this salsa.<p>

     Unlike salsas that have lots of raw ingredients, this one can be kept for
days in the refrigerator. As you approach the final step of this simple salsa,
you can choose whether you like the rusty-colored, fully integrated flavors of
the smoother version, or the olive-colored, flecked with red, rougher-looking
version that'll offer surprise bursts of chipotle in every mouthful. When you
have the time, try a third alternative in the mortar, crushing together the
garlic and chiles, then working in the tomatillos; the garlic and chiles will
be noticeably richer and fuller, the texture of the tomatillos beautifully
coarse.<p>

<br>

<center>
<font size=2><b>MAKES ABOUT 1 1/4 CUPS</b></font>
</center>

<br>


<b>
<UL>
<LI><i>3 to 6 (1/4 to 1/2 ounce total) dried </i>chiles chipotles colorados
(chiles moritas)

     <ul>OR <i>2 to 4 (1/4 to 1/2 ounce total) dried </i>chiles chipotles
     mecos
</ul>
    <ul> OR <i>3 to 6 canned </i>chiles chipotles en adobo
</ul>
<LI><i>3 large garlic cloves, unpeeled

<LI>8 ounces (5 to 6 medium) tomatillos, husked and rinsed

<LI>Salt, about 1/2 teaspoon
<LI>Sugar, about 1/4 teaspoon
</b></i></UL>

<br>

<b>1. Toasting and roasting the key ingredients.</b> Set an ungreased
griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat. If using dried chiles, break off
their stems. Toast the chiles a few at a time: Lay them on the hot surface,
press flat for a few seconds with a metal spatula (they'll crackle faintly and
release their smoky aroma), then flip and press down to toast the other side.
Transfer the toasted chiles to a bowl, cover with hot water and let rehydrate
for 30 minutes, stirring regularly to ensure even soaking. Pour off all the
water and discard.<p>

     If using canned chiles, simply remove them from the <i>adobo</i> they're
packed in.<p>

     On a heavy, ungreased skillet or griddle over medium heat (you'll already
have it on if you're using dried chiles), roast the unpeeled garlic, turning
occasionally, until blackened in spots and soft, about 15 minutes. Cool, slip
off the papery skins, then roughly chop.<p>

     Lay the tomatillos on a baking sheet and place about 4 inches below a very
hot broiler. When the tomatillos blister, blacken, and soften on one side, about
5 minutes, turn them over and roast the other side. Cool completely on the
baking sheet.<p>

<br>

<b>2. The salsa.</b> <i>Method 1 (the smoother alternative):</i> Scrape the
tomatillos (and any juices that have accumulated around them) into a food
processor or blender and add the rehydrated or canned chiles and garlic. Pulse
the machine until everything is thick and relatively smooth. <i>Method 2
 (the
chunkier alternative): </i>Scrape the tomatillos and juices into a food
processor or blender and add the garlic. Pulse until everything is coarsely
pureed. Chop the rehydrated or canned chiles into tiny bits, then stir them
in.<p>

     Transfer to a serving bowl and stir in enough water, usually 3 to 4
tablespoons, to give the salsa an easily spoonable consistency. Taste and
season with salt, plus a little sugar to soften the tangy edge.<p>



<br>

<b><font size=2>ADVANCE PREPARATION</font> -- </b>The finished salsa will
keep about 1 week in the
refrigerator, though the tomatillos have the brightest flavor for the first 24
hours.<p>
<br>

<b><font size=2>OTHER CHILES YOU CAN USE</font> -- </b>Dried &aacute;rbol
(use 3 to 6) or cascabel
(use 2 to 3) can replace the chipotles. Dried <i>chile pasilla
oaxaque&ntilde;o</i> taste delicious here (use 1 to 3) if you can lay your
hands on them.<p>

</font>
</center>

<br>

<b><i>Crusty Chipotle-Beef Sandwich -- </i></b>Marinate very thinly cut
(minute) steaks (<i>bistec</i> in Mexico) with lime juice and salt, then sear
them in a large very hot lightly oiled pan or on a grill. Slice into thin
strips and, in a pan over medium heat, toss with enough salsa to coat nicely.
Split crusty submarine rolls or Mexican <i>teleras,</i> hollow them out
slightly, then pile in the meat and sprinkle with crumbled Mexican <i>queso
a&ntilde;ejo</i> or Parmesan. I love these sandwiches with a smear of leftover
fried black beans on the bun.<p>
<br>

<b><i>Great Chicken Livers -- </i></b>For 4 people, rinse a generous pound of
chicken livers, pat dry, then toss with a little salted flour. In a large hot
heavy skillet filmed with oil or bacon fat, fry the livers in an uncrowded
layer until crusty and still pink in the center. Pour in a full recipe of the
salsa, let come to a boil, then serve with rice or pasta.<p>

	<font size=5>M</font>ost people--certainly most laymen--would be apt to think that the chief
business of the schools is to give pupils at least a modest working knowledge
of the subjects of the curriculum. Not a few students of education, it is true,
consider that this is a misconception, and that the true purpose of schools is
to bring about an adjustment to social demands for which the various subjects
are at best only means. Nobody, however, who surveys the conventional working
apparatus of courses of study, textbooks, recitations, examinations, and marks
can have much doubt that in practice the schools are making the mastery of the
curriculum an end in itself. Whether in theory they ought to or not, this in
fact is what they are manifestly trying to do.<p>

<p>

But they are not succeeding. About that there is no room for theorizing. Nor is
their failure sporadic, and confined to a few places where management is
unusually bad. It occurs almost universally, in the cities and in the country,
in large institutions and in small. The schools go through an elaborate,
costly, and exasperating set of motions called teaching natural science,
foreign languages, English, and so forth. Yet what is contained in textbooks
and syllabi obstinately refuses to transfer itself to the minds of the patrons
and stay there. In the grand struggle to get subject matter off the page and
into the head, the schools are suffering a spectacular and most disconcerting
defeat.<p>

<p>

This, I am aware, is a formidable statement. But it is made on formidable
evidence. The recent investigation carried on by the Carnegie Foundation in the
colleges of Pennsylvania, issued under the title *The Student and His
Knowledge*, which has caused considerable furor over the ignorance of college
seniors, is only a drop in the bucket. For proof of the defeat of the schools
does not depend on one investigation alone, or on a dozen, or a score, or a
hundred. We have here nothing less than the consistent testimony of thirty
years of enormously varied research in education.<p>

<p>

Since about 1910 many thousands of investigations have appeared, dealing with
almost every conceivable aspect of school work. Comparatively few of them
explicitly and directly consider the efficiency of the schools in terms of how
much subject matter they manage to induce the pupils to learn. Yet a great
many, without particularly setting out to do so, throw a most startling light
upon the results of education. Taken in the mass, they add up to a consistent,
coherent, and extremely impressive body of testimony, pointing towards one
conclusion: whatever the goods which our schools are delivering, they are not
what one might expect to find in packages labeled science, history, foreign
languages, English, and so forth.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>I.</font></b>

<p>

Suppose we call the roll of the principal subjects, asking in each case what a
person ought to learn if he is to have anything worth calling an elementary
working mastery of it, and also to what extent this is really being acquired.<p>

<p>

Let us start with mathematics. Here we have the most precise and powerful
instrument for abstract thinking and analysis devised by man. This, indeed, is
the very essence of the subject. Mathematics is a technique of thinking, and if
you have not learned to think in its special language you just have not learned
mathematics at all. Such thinking may not be very intricate or advanced; but,
all the way from simple arithmetic to differential equations and beyond, it is
the same kind of process. That process is quite different from doing sums,
because when one is set a sum one is told either directly or by the most
obvious sort of hint whether to add, subtract, multiply, divide, or what not,
and all one has to do is to follow certain rules and remember certain tables,
which clearly is routine rather than thinking. Essentially the job of every
mathematician, all the way from a first-grade child to an Einstein, is to take
hold of situations and disentangle them by the techniques of the science. A
beginner may not be able to deal with very complicated situations, or to carry
the disentangling very far. But he must go some appreciable distance along this
road--he must be able to decide what treatment the given situation requires,
whether addition or multiplication or something else--before he can claim
anything that can possibly be called mastery of mathematics.<p>

<p>

Now we know beyond peradventure that a very large percentage of children
studying mathematics in school go hardly a step in this direction. For
instance, the educational authorities in Iowa have carried through an ambitious
project known as the 'Every-Pupil Testing Program.' Part of that program was an
examination for mastery of the material taught in ninth-grade algebra. In
constructing this examination it was clear to the experienced workers that they
must use only very simple items, or almost every pupil would be defeated. (An
ominous consideration at the start. Inexperienced test-makers tend strongly to
expect far too much.) Sixty-two such items were assembled, samples being the
following 'Write a formula for the perimeter of the rectangle. Write a formula
for the area of the rectangle. A dealer sold a suit of clothes for $42, making
a profit of 20 per cent on the cost; how many dollars did he make?' Simple
enough, one would say; yet genuine problems, because they require not the mere
recalling of knowledge, but its application to the analysis of situations. Yet
it appeared that half of the large number of pupils taking the test, all of
whom had taken algebra, could do no more than ten of the items. Other results
showed that actual working knowledge of the ostensible content of the algebra
course was being acquired in only the most meagre degree.<p>

<p>

Again, another investigation was carried on in which a test in elementary
mathematics was given to a large number of children. When they were simply told
to perform certain operations, such as factorization, reduction of fractions,
the 'solution' of easy equations, and the like, 1000 out of 1200 succeeded. But
when problems were set up, which not only were simple, but involved no
operations other than those which these children had shown they could perform,
only about 300 succeeded. What shall it profit anyone to be able to do a
certain kind of sum on instruction but unable to use his skill in a problematic
situation? Can we say that such a person has any genuine mastery of
mathematics?<p>

<p>

Very similar results are reported for geometry. Pupils may be able to repeat
the proofs of theorems, or to recite definitions and postulates; but this is no
evidence that they can deal with 'originals'--that is, with problems for the
attack upon which theorems and definitions are only tools. Once more we ask in
what sense a person has 'mastered' a set of tools which he cannot use. If you
feel inclined to say that one cannot learn a proof without thought and
understanding, consider this: it has been shown again and again that even very
small accidental changes in the proof of a theorem will destroy the ability of
many pupils to repeat it. These children know how to prove that the square on
the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle ABC is equal to the sum of the
squares on the other two sides. Good! Now call the triangle PQR. A surprising
percentage of your group will be rendered helpless. Have they really learned
and understood the proof at all?<p>

<p>

Moreover, geometry does not stay learned. College freshmen, all of whom had
studied the subject within the past two years, were given a test designed for
high-school students: 86 per cent of these freshmen were below the high-school
norm; 50 per cent did worse than 75 per cent of the high-school students; and
26 per cent did worse than nine tenths of the high-school students. Also, they
were conspicuously weak in applying geometric reasoning to problematic
situations--that is, in the USE of the geometric equipment they had labored to
acquire. A subject which has been grasped and understood does not fade from the
mind so easily and fast.<p>

<p>

Other investigations have turned the spotlight on the intimate processes of
pupils who are tackling the job of dealing with simple mathematical problems.
Put pupils up against a situation requiring mathematical thinking, and what
happens? Do they carry through intelligent methods of attack, rational in
themselves even when slips in computation result in wrong answers? Do they
experiment and analyze and try out alternative procedures in some sort of
planned sequence? The author of one important study finds that few of them seem
to reason at all, and that reflective thought is not evoked. 'Instead, many of
them appear to perform almost random calculations upon the numbers given. Where
they do solve a problem correctly the response seems to be determined largely
by habit.'<p>

<p>

Still another body of disconcerting evidence is at hand. One would naturally
suppose that the longer a person studied a subject, the more mastery of it he
would gain. Yet, when tests of mathematical competence which do not simply
duplicate the situations and routines of textbook and course are applied, it
has often been found that there is little of such gain with time. Apparently
pupils are going through textbooks and courses but not effectively gaining in
mathematical insight and mastery. Everything comes together in an inescapable
conclusion. Mathematics is being energetically taught, but it is not being
learned to a degree that would, judged by common-sense standards, seem worth
while.<p>

<p>

In natural science the situation is much the same. Teachers of physics in
twenty-eight schools began to have misgivings about the efficiency of their
work and the amount of physics actually penetrating the minds of their pupils.
Obviously a person might be able to recite fairly well on assignments prepared
ad hoc the night before, or to do fairly well on examinations closely related
to the course, and still have no independent mastery of the subject as such. So
the teachers constructed a test which, on the basis of their pooled judgment,
represented what one ought to know when he had covered the two topics of
mechanics and heat. The results were illuminating, not to say startling. The
majority of pupils fell far below expectation. Such questions were asked as: 'A
stone is dropped and takes two seconds to hit the ground; from what height is
it dropped?' 'How much work is done to raise two pounds one yard?' These
particular problems had never been set, but everyone was supposed to have the
knowledge and technique needed to solve them. Inability to answer could only
mean lack of mastery of the subject as contemplated in the courses; yet this
appeared very generally. Also, it was found that a student's performance on the
independent test had very little relationship to his rating in the course in
physics. It was one thing to give correct answers under the special promptings
of assignment, textbook, and recitation, but quite another to show a mastery of
physics as such.<p>

<p>

A few years ago a comprehensive test to reveal competence in chemistry,
including in its scope, mechanical operations, the use of formulae and
equations, and general information, was given to groups of students in high
school, and to college students who had completed freshman chemistry. Let us
begin with the showing of the college students. Remember that all of them had
finished freshman chemistry; some had taken the subject in high school, and
others had not. But on the test there was no significant difference in the
performance of these two groups. Apparently the time spent studying the subject
in high school as a preliminary to taking it in college was an almost total
loss. University teachers might easily think this a severe reflection on
high-school chemistry. So indeed it is. But they should not boast too soon. For
those who had taken chemistry in high school and had not yet gone further
showed up just about as well on the test as those who had taken the subject
both in high school and as freshmen in college. Two years of the subject did
not give much better results than one, whether that one year was spent in high
school or in college.<p>

<p>

Moreover, with both physics and chemistry it has been shown that failure is
most conspicuous in the learning of those techniques and principles of analysis
which are the chief values of these subjects, and on which their practical
application principally depends. A smattering of unrelated facts, rather than
an insight into integrated, functioning laws, is what is acquired. And even
such facts are insecurely learned.<p>

<p>

Quite recently investigators have been raising a new question, more fundamental
than any I have discussed so far. Does the study of science, including
mathematics, teach scientific thinking? Just conceivably this might happen even
without the student's gaining any very extensive or exact information, or any
very firm grasp upon techniques and methods of analysis. Of course it is much
harder to tell whether a person is able to think scientifically than whether he
knows certain facts or is able to use certain techniques, so results here are
apt to be less reliable than elsewhere. Still, the attempt has been made rather
frequently, with great care and seriousness, and the answer to the question is:
No! There is practically no evidence at all that science, as taught in school,
makes one more careful about hypotheses, more willing to suspend judgment, more
openminded towards alternative views, more able to distinguish truth from
hokum. It does not, so far as we can tell, successfully promote these or any
other typical virtues of the scientific mind.<p>

<p>

<font size-4><b>III.</font></b><p>

<p>

Now let us turn to the so called language arts--foreign languages and English.
Regarding the former not much need be said; technical research simply confirms
a painfully obvious case. No one can be said to have a mastery of any language
unless he can read, write, or speak it, and not much of a mastery unless he can
compass all three. The language must serve him as an instrument of
communication in its own right, which means not only far more than being able
laboriously to translate it by main force of grammar and dictionary, but also
something essentially different. How many pupils achieve any such freedom with
French, German, or Spanish? Very few! Ask the same question about Latin, and
you must change 'Very few' to 'Virtually none.' It has been shown that, under
the conditions commonly found in our schools, a person must study Latin in high
school, through college, and for one graduate year before being able to read it
as freely as an average fifth-grade child reads English. Given really efficient
teaching, an average person can attain a good reading mastery of French,
German, or Spanish in two school years. (For Latin one might have to make it
three years.) The thing can be done, but it happens all too rarely. What is the
use of learning a language to a point below that of mastery?<p>

<p>

But what about English? Here too there is a record of failure and defeat. Do
pupils in school learn to read their mother tongue effectively? Yes and no. Up
to the fifth or sixth grade, reading, on the whole, is effectively taught and
well learned. To that level we find a steady and general improvement, but
beyond it the curves flatten out to a dead level. This is not because a person
arrives at his natural limit of efficiency in reading when he reaches the sixth
grade, for it has been shown again and again that with special tuition much
older children, and also adults, can make enormous improvement. Nor does it
mean that most sixth-graders read well enough for all practical purposes. A
great many pupils do poorly in high school because of sheer ineptitude in
getting meaning from the printed page. They can improve; they need to improve;
but they don't<p>

<p>

The average high-school graduate has done a good deal of reading, and if he
goes on to college he will do a good deal more; but he is likely to be a poor
and incompetent reader. (Note that this holds true of the average student, not
the person who is a subject for special remedial treatment.) He can follow a
simple piece of fiction and enjoy it. But put him up against a closely written
exposition, a carefully organized and economically stated argument, or a
passage requiring critical consideration, and he is at a loss. It has been
shown, for instance, that the average high school student is amazingly inept at
indicating the central thought of a passage, or the levels of emphasis and
subordination in an argument or exposition. To all intents and purposes he
remains a sixth-grade reader till well along in college.<p>

<p>

Moreover, the schools are not successful in promoting an interest in reading.
Survey after survey has come out with the same general results. Pupils in
school, and also high-school and college graduates, read but little. Medium
grade magazines and fair-to-medium fiction are the chief standbys. Reading
choices are made on hearsay, casual recommendation, and display advertising.
Education is clearly not producing a discriminating or venturesome reading
public. As one investigator concludes, there is no indication 'that the schools
are developing permanent interest in reading as a leisure-time activity.'<p>

<p>

The case is the same when we consider the art of writing the English language.
No great number of people are going to turn into subtle and imaginative
stylists, even with the best of teaching. But properly directed effort over a
period of years should certainly equip the average human being with what it
takes to express himself clearly, exactly, and correctly in his native tongue.
This happens, however, only on the most meagre scale. Investigators use a good
many different techniques to reveal the competence and maturity with which a
person can express himself in English. One of these is the ratio of the number
of dependent clauses used to the number of sentences used, which serves to
indicate the complexity of the linguistic pattern turned out. On this basis, to
be sure, there is a steady development throughout the school years. But other
criteria show that we have little cause for satisfaction. All through high
school and well into college we find the most amazing solecisms of grammar and
usage persisting. A great many high-school pupils are not able to discriminate
between what is a sentence and what is not.<p>

<p>

There is yet another highly significant criterion whose application yields some
very startling results. This is range of vocabulary. One does not, of course,
want people to use five-dollar words in profusion; but without adequate
vocabulary equipment it is not possible to express fine and precise shades of
meaning. Now word counts show that in the English of students, both in formal
compositions assigned in school and in letters, very few words occur outside
the thousand most commonly employed in the language. More significantly still,
as one goes from senior year in high school to senior year in college, the
vocabulary content of written English hardly seems to increase at all. After
twelve years in school a great many students still use English in many respects
childish and undeveloped; and four years more bring slight improvement.<p>

<p>

In the social studies and history the situation is much the same; I shall
mention the results of but one typical investigation. A test was constructed
calling for knowledge of a range of very simple facts in United States history.
It was given to pupils in the upper grades who had covered the field once. They
could answer only 15 per cent of the questions. High-school students, who had
spent an additional year on material largely identical, could manage 33 per
cent. College sophomores, after a third journey over the same pathway,
answered, on an average, 49 per cent. Less than half the simplest and most
obvious facts assimilated after three exposures! Surely a time-consuming,
inefficient process, to say the least.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>IV.</font></b><p>

<p>

Clearly, then, the campaign to induce and enable students effectively to master
the chief subject of the curriculum is not yielding any very striking
victories.<p>

<p>

What about the effect of the schools in building up in people's minds a stock
of general knowledge or information? This has been a tempting problem for
research workers, largely because a general knowledge test is comparatively
easy to construct; so we have plenty of material. The Carnegie Foundation
inquiry in Pennsylvania, to which I have already referred, dealt with this
question, and its results may be taken as representative, though they are
played up with unusual impressiveness. It showed that the gain in general
information between sophomore and senior year in college, and indeed between
high-school and college graduation, was meagre and uncertain. Many college
seniors had no wider range of general knowledge than sophomores, and some of
them were no better informed than high-school seniors. The report has stirred
up considerable comment, but to anyone familiar with the literature of
educational research it comes as no surprise.<p>

<p>

In this day of encyclopaedias, World Almanacs, and public libraries, a large
stock of miscellaneous information for ready reference does not seem
particularly vital. Even professional scholars can and do look up specific data
when and as needed. It is far more important to know where to look for facts,
and what to do with them when found, than to be able to produce them from under
one's hat at a moment's notice. So the very strong and consistent evidence that
twelve to sixteen years of schooling leave most people very inadequately
equipped with ready-to-use memory knowledge, though highly suggestive, seems of
secondary significance.<p>

<p>

The other body of experimental results, however, is quite a different affair.
These are the investigations dealing with what is known as transfer of
training. Probably all of us have at some time been told that a subject which
seems useless and futile for its own sake is still worth studying because it
helps with some other subject. Latin is said to help with other foreign
languages, and to improve one's English. Grammar is thought to enable one to
write and read better. Elementary mathematics is supposed to be an aid to
physics. Geometry trains one in reasoning. Such claims are quite familiar. What
one learns in one subject is said to transfer to others, and so to help in
mastering them.<p>

<p>

The hypothesis of transfer has been one of the chief topics of educational and
psychological research. Something like one hundred and seventy published
investigations have been devoted to it. Their general and accepted testimony is
that very limited transfer takes place. Students who have taken Latin show up
no better in other languages than those who have not; nor do they read better,
write better, spell better, or use larger vocabularies in their native
language. It has been shown again and again that work in English grammar has
almost no value as an aid to the accurate and competent use of the English
language. Persons who have spent a great deal of time studying grammar do no
better either in composition or in reading than others who have had little or
no grammatical training. Teachers of physics frequently complain that when
pupils enter their courses they seem to forget all the mathematics they ever
knew, and research backs up such grumblings. As to the argument that geometry
teaches people to reason better about things in general, it is preposterous,
and advanced without a shred of evidence.<p>

<p>

The cumulative results of this long list of investigations are authoritative
and accepted. They are summarized in almost every elementary textbook on
educational psychology, and are one of the commonplaces at teachers'
gatherings. Practically every professionally trained teacher in America has
heard the news that transfer of training does not take place, though without a
very critical or adequate insight into the evidence.<p>

<p>

When one studies a subject, any benefits there may be accrue within the subject
itself and not somewhere else. Such is the ascertained fact. (I state it
broadly, and without various, not unimportant, qualifications.) But the proper
inference from it, the moral of the tale,  is hardly ever pointed out. Transfer
of training ought to take place. Its failure to do is a reproach to teaching.
When pupils cannot use their mathematics in a physics course, something must be
wrong. Perhaps they never really learned their mathematics in the mathematics
course! Latin, with its close affiliation with other languages, ought to help
with French, Spanish, and German, not to mention English. When this fails to
happen, it is a reflection upon the teaching of Latin. Again, English style is,
in a sense, applied grammar. So when we prove that learning grammar does not
improve English expression--and this has been proved to the hilt--the inference
must be that grammar was pretty badly learned.<p>

<p>

Lack of transfer is not a law of nature or a fiat of the Almighty. It is an
indictment of teaching. Learn Latin as it should be learned, and it will help
you with other languages. Acquire a real grasp of mathematical thinking, and it
will not fail you when you tackle physics. The investigations on the transfer
of training simply go to swell the great volume of evidence that the schools,
in their attempt to generate adequate and worth-while masteries in the
subject-matter fields, are meeting with defeat.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>V.</font></b><p>

<p>

Why should all this be so? How does it happen that Johnnie Jones and Susie
Smith spend a good deal of time on various subjects with such disappointing
returns? What can we do about it?<p>

<p>

The trouble is that Johnnie and Susie set up a ligne Maginot of sheer mental
inertia, through which the attacking forces of education cannot break. For this
the fault is ours far more than theirs. It is their inevitable and instinctive
reaction to the whole apparatus of an education centring about the
traditionally determined curriculum. We are trying to sell Johnnie and Susie an
unsalable bill of goods.<p>

<p>

Let us see as simply and clearly as possible just what we are asking them to
do. We assume a standard body of content, including, by way of illustration,
the atomic law, the conditions leading up to the American Revolution, the
Tragedy of King Lear, and the skills required for solving a quadratic equation.
Obviously Johnnie and Susie cannot learn everything in the world, though in an
earlier and simpler day some very considerable thinkers did suppose that an
educated man was one who knew everything. To-day, however, the proposition is
manifestly impossible. Since life is short and school days fleeting, Johnnie
and Susie can assimilate only a very small fraction of human culture. So we
must make a selection.<p>

<p>

How do we make it? We make it on the basis of nothing more intelligent or
reassuring than long tradition. The material taught in the schools goes far
back through the years, some of it to a remote antiquity. Of course, like every
other tradition, it has altered somewhat with the passage of time, but slowly
and superficially. It has a sort of independent life of its own, which is
highly resistant to change. Textbooks and syllabi tend to be based on previous
textbooks and syllabi. Teachers tend to purvey what they themselves have
learned. The pattern of the basic curriculum is extraordinarily rigid, and has
never been critically reconstructed from the ground up, except in a few favored
institutions. In the main the schools continue to teach it for no better reason
than that it has always been taught.<p>

<p>

Now how much confidence can we have that a body of content so selected is
really worth learning? Surely very little! Can we say that it is a balanced and
representative sampling of the best and finest that the human spirit has
achieved and is achieving? By no means. In the standard curriculum there is
some fine gold, but also an unconscionable quantity of dross. If we wanted to
give our convenient inquiring friend, the Man from Mars, an idea of the best in
human culture, we would hardly hand him a set of school texts and syllabi. Why
should we do it with Johnnie and Susie? Or can we say that what we offer is
vitally related to the interests, concerns, and needs of young Americans? Again
the answer is: No! Nothing of the sort has been considered in making the
selection. Indeed, it is notorious that this material has been assembled in
advance, without any reference to the kind of people who are supposed to learn
it.<p>

<p>

But this is a fatal weakness. If we ourselves can have no great confidence in
the importance of the things we teach in the schools, how can we expect Johnnie
and Susie to believe in it? And if they have no authentic sense of the
importance and value of the things they learn, they cannot--literally they
cannot--learn them well. For the human mind is not naturally docile. It is
capable of amazing feats of resistance and rejection, beneath a tame and
dutiful exterior. It assimilates into its life and makes its own only those
things which, for some genuine reason, seem to matter. Everything else stays on
the surface and soon evaporates. This is no recondite scientific discovery, but
simple common sense. Everybody knows it from his own experience, though not
everybody drags it into consciousness as a guiding principle. Watch Johnnie and
Susie at work on some hobby. Then contrast them as they work at school tasks.
The difference? Obvious!<p>

<p>

Here, I insist, is where our trouble starts. We set up a body of material
which, in the nature of the case, must be mastered not because of its intrinsic
and manifest appeal, but under some kind of duress. Learning under no urge
except external duress, however, is contrary to all natural tendency.
Resistances are set up which frustrate the process, no matter how 'good' or
docile the learner seems. These are the forces which defeat the schools.<p>

<p>

Is there a way out? Of course there is. The first necessity is to abandon the
idee fixe of a standard body of content which everyone must learn. People young
and old learn what matters to them, what seems of genuine moment to them.
Whatever fails to come with the authentic impact of reality and need is
automatically and fatally rejected. In a very genuine sense each one of us
makes his own curriculum; for the only curriculum that matters is the one a
person carries in his head, rather than the one in the textbooks and syllabi.<p>

<p>

Hence the great necessity is for far more flexibility in our whole treatment of
children in the schools, and above all for flexibility in what we ask them to
master. Many reformist and experimental schemes have this as their controlling
principle, and they succeed in so far as they put it into effect. Teachers
should be free to bring to their pupils those portions and aspects of subject
matter which are of immediate and living concern. They should not be doomed to
keeping a rigid lock step, or to covering a predetermined area.<p>

<p>

This does not in the least mean that we shall stop teaching mathematics,
natural science, literature; and the like, and substitute current events, wood
carving, and cookery. It only means that not everybody will learn the same
mathematics, natural science, and literature, and that people will not always
learn them in the same internal order and sequence. We seem to have heard that
one man's meat is another man's poison. Why not apply this hackneyed wisdom
here? Any person's cultural meat--the culture which he is able to assimilate,
and which nourishes him--depends upon his present life interests, his status,
his needs, his concerns. And our schools must be so organized that it will
become possible to choose for a given individual or a given group at a given
time those elements of culture which will indeed provide nourishment.<p>

<p>

Will this prevent pupils from mastering the 'logic' of mathematics, or natural
science, or social science? They are not mastering it now! Strange to say, they
are not mastering it precisely because we present it to them as a logic.
Mathematics, for instance, is a technique or tool of thought. That is its
essence, its logic. But we do not learn to use this tool by first studying its
inner structure and organization up to a certain point, and then applying it.
We learn to use it by actually using it, in no matter how haphazard and
fumbling a fashion, upon problems which we really want to solve. So with all
the other disciplines. Let us handle our subject matter as something which is
alive, and its logic will take care of itself.<p>

<p>

To organize the schools in terms of flexibility rather than rigidity is no
small or easy task. It calls for much revision of conventional procedures and
instrumentalities. Yet it can be done, and in fact the work is going on apace.
For the benefit of those conservatives who may think that the way to get
children to learn more in school is a return to the good old days of high
pressure and rigid requirements, I project one more nugget of ascertained fact.
It has been shown that the experimental schools actually produce better
subject-matter learning than the conventional schools, with pupils of equal
ability. Carry such tendencies further, and we have good reason to expect still
more satisfactory results. What we contemplate is, to be sure, a breach with
some of our most adamantine traditions and customs. But we have before us the
problem of an intelligent rather than a stupid approach to the task which is of
such supreme importance in a democratic society--the task of bringing to the
individual his birthright of culture. It is a task in which we cannot afford
to, and need not, accept defeat.

At this level, the history of movies is a triumph oftechnology. I'm not putting down this kind of movie: I don't know anybody whodoesn't enjoy it more or less at some time or other. But I wouldn't be muchinterested if that were the only kind of movie, any more than I'd be interestedif all movies were like Last Year at Marienbad or The Red Desert or Juliet ofthe Spirits. What of the other kinds?<p><p>While American enthusiasm for movies has never been so high, and even whileteachers prepare to recognize film-making as an art, American movies have neverbeen worse. In other parts of the world there has been a new golden age: greattalents have fought their way through in Japan, India, Sweden, Italy, France;even in England there has been something that passes for a renaissance. But nothere: American enthusiasm is fed largely by foreign films, memories, andinnocence. The tragic or, depending on your point of view, pitiful history ofAmerican movies in the last fifteen years may be suggested by a look at thecareer of Marlon Brando.<p><p>It used to be said that great clowns, like Chaplin, always wanted to playHamlet, but what happens in this country is that our Hamlets, like JohnBarrymore, turn into buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their publicreputations. Bette Davis has made herself lovable by turning herself into acaricature of a harpy--just what, in one of her last good roles, as MargoChanning in All About Eve, she feared she was becoming. The women who were thebiggest stars of the forties are either retired, semi-retired, or, like Davis,Crawford, and DeHavilland, have become the mad queens of Grand Guignol in thesixties, grotesques and comics, sometimes inadvertently.<p><p>Marlon Brando's career indicates the new speed of these processes. Brando, ourmost powerfuI young screen actor, the only one who suggested tragic force, themajor protagonist of contemporary American themes in the fifties, is already aself-parodying comedian.<p><p>I mean by protagonist the hero who really strikes a nerve--not a Cary Grant whodelights with his finesse, nor mushy heart-warmers like Gary Cooper and JamesStewart with their blubbering sincerity (sometimes it seemed that the tallerthe man, the smaller he pretended to be; that was his notion being "ordinary"and "universal" and "real") but men whose intensity on the screen stirs anintense reaction in the audience. Not Gregory Peck or Tyrone Power or RobertTaylor with their conventional routine heroics, but James Cagney or Edward G.Robinson in the gangster films, John Garfield in the Depression movies, KirkDouglas as a post-war heel. These men are not necessarily better actors, butthrough the accidents of casting and circumstances or because of what theythemselves embodied or projected, they meant something important to us. Abrilliant actor like Jason Robards, Jr., may never become a protagonist of thiskind unless he gets a role in which he embodies something new and relevant tothe audience.<p><p>Protagonists are always loners, almost by definition. The big one to survivethe war was the Bogart figure--the man with a code (moral, aesthetic,chivalrous) in a corrupt society. He had, so to speak, inside knowledge of thenature of the enemy. He was a sophisticated, urban version of the Westernerwho, classically, knew both sides of the law and was tough enough to go his ownway and yet, romantically, still do right.<p><p>Brando represented a reaction against the post-war mania for security. As aprotagonist, the Brando of the early fifties had no code, only his instincts.He was a development from the gangster leader and the outlaw. He was antisocialbecause he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strongenough not to take the crap. (In England it was thought that The Wild One wouldincite adolescents to violence.)<p><p>There was a sense of excitement, of danger in his presence, but perhaps hisspecial appeal was in a kind of simple conceit, the conceit of tough kids.There was humor in it--swagger and arrogance that were vain and childish, andsomehow seemed very American. He was explosively dangerous without being"serious" in the sense of having ideas. There was no theory, no cant in hisleadership. He didn't care about social position or a job or respectability,and because he didn't care he was a big man; for what is less attractive, whatmakes a man smaller, than his worrying about his status? Brando represented acontemporary version of the free American.<p><p>Because he had no code, except an aesthetic one--a commitment to a style oflife--he was easily betrayed by those he trusted. There he was, the newprimitive, a Byronic Dead-End Kid, with his quality of vulnerability. Hisacting was so physical--so exploratory, tentative, wary--that we could sensewith him, feel him pull back at the slightest hint of rebuff. We in theaudience felt protective: we knew how lonely he must be in his assertiveness.Who even in hell wants to be an outsider? And he was no intellectual who couldrationalize it, learn somehow to accept it, to live with it. He could only feelit, act it out, be "The Wild One"--and God knows how many kids felt, "That'sthe story of my life."<p><p>Brando played variations on rebel themes: from the lowbrow, disturbinglyinarticulate brute, Stanley Kowalski, with his suggestions of violence waitingbehind the slurred speech, the sullen Ace, to his Orpheus standing before thejudge in the opening scene of The Fugitive Kind, unearthly, mythic, the rebelas artist, showing classic possibilities he was never to realize (or has notyet realized).<p><p>He was our angry young man--the delinquent, the tough, the rebel--who stood atthe center of our common experience. When, as Terry Malloy in On theWaterfront, he said to his brother, "Oh Charlie, oh Charlie . . . you don'tunderstand. I could have had class. I could have been a contender. I could havebeen somebody, instead of a bum--which is what I am," he spoke for all ourfailed hopes. It was the great American lament, of Broadway, of Hollywood, aswell as of the docks.<p><p>I am describing the Brando who became a star, not the man necessarily, but theboy-man he projected, and also the publicity and the come-on. The publicity hada built-in ambivalence. Though the fan magazines might describe him alluringlyas dreamy, moody, thin-skinned, easily hurt, gentle, intense, unpredictable,hating discipline, a defender of the underdog, other journalists andinfluential columnists were not so sympathetic toward what this suggested.<p><p>It is one of the uglier traditions of movie business that frequently when astar gets big enough to want big money and artistic selection or control of hisproductions, the studios launch large-scale campaigns designed to cut him downto an easier-to-deal-with size or to supplant him with younger, cheaper talent.Thus, early in movie history the great Lillian Gish was derided as unpopular inthe buildup of the young Garbo (by the same studio), and in newspapers all overthe country, Marilyn Monroe, just a few weeks before her death, was discoveredto have no box-office draw. The gossip columnists serve as the shock troopswith all those little items about how so-and-so is getting a big head, how heisn't taking the advice of the studio executives who know best, and so forth.<p><p>In the case of Brando, the most powerful ladies were especially virulentbecause they were obviously part of what he was rebelling against; in floutingtheir importance, he might undermine their position with other new stars whomight try to get by without kowtowing to the blackmailing old vultures waitingto pounce in the name of God, Motherhood, and Americanism. What was unusual inBrando's case was the others who joined in the attack.<p><p>In 1957, Truman Capote, having spent an evening with Brando and then a yearwriting up that evening (omitting his own side of the conversation andinterjecting interpretations), published "The Duke in His Own Domain" in theNew Yorker. The unwary Brando was made to look public ass number one. And yetthe odd thing about this interview was that Capote, in his supersophistication,kept using the most commonplace, middlebrow evidence and arguments againsthim--for example, that Brando in his egotism was not impressed by Joshua Loganas a movie director. (The matter for astonishment was that Capote was--or waswilling to use anything to make his literary exercise more effective.) DespiteCapote's style and venomous skill, it is he in this interview, not Brando, whoequates money and success with real importance and accomplishment. His arrowsfit snugly into the holes they have made only if you accept the usualmiddlebrow standards of marksmanship.<p><p>It was now open season on Brando: Hollis Alpert lumbered onto the pages ofCosmopolitan to attack him for not returning to the stage to become a greatactor--as if the theater were the citadel of art. What theater? Was Brandoreally wrong in feeling that movies are more relevant to our lives than thatdead theater which so many journalists seem to regard as the custodian ofintegrity and creativity? David Susskind was shocked that a mere actor likeBrando should seek to make money, might even dare to consider his own judgmentand management preferable to that of millionaire producers. Dwight Macdonaldchided Brando for not being content to be a craftsman: "Mr. Brando has alwaysaspired to something Deeper and More Significant, he has always fancied himselfas like an intellectual"--surely  a crime he shares with Mr. Macdonald.<p><p>If he had not been so presumptuous as to try to think for himself in Hollywoodand if he hadn't had a sense of irony, he could have pretended--and convinced alot of people--that he was still a contender. But what crown could he aspireto? Should he be a "king" like Gable, going from one meaningless picture toanother, performing the rituals of manly toughness, embracing the studiostable, to be revered, finally, because he was the company actor who never gaveanybody any trouble? Columnists don't attack that kind of king on hispapier-mache throne; critics don't prod him to return to the stage; the publicdoesn't turn against him.<p><p>Almost without exception, American actors who don't accept trashy assignmentsmake nothing, not even superior trash. Brando accepts the trash, but unlike themonochromatic, "always dependable" Gable, he has too much energy orinventiveness or contempt just to go through the motions. And when he appearson the screen, there is a special quality of recognition in the audience: weknow he's too big for the role.<p><p>Perhaps, as some in picture business say, Brando "screws up" his pictures byrewriting the scripts; certainly he hasn't been very astute in the directorsand writers he has worked with. What he needed was not more docility, but morestrength, the confidence to work with young talent, to try difficult roles. Buthe's no longer a contender, no longer a protagonist who challenges anythingserious. Brando has become a comic.<p><p>The change was overwhelmingly apparent in the 1963 Mutiny on the Bounty, which,rather surprisingly, began with a miniature class conflict between Brando, asthe aristocratic Fletcher Christian, and Trevor Howard, as the lowborn CaptainBligh, who cannot endure Christian's contempt for him. Brando played the fopwith such relish that audiences shared in the joke; it was like a Dead-End Kidplaying Congreve. The inarticulate grunting Method actor is showing off, andit's a classic and favorite American joke: the worm turns, Destry gets hisguns, American honor is redeemed. He can talk as fancy as any of them, evenfancier. (In the action sequences he's uninteresting, not handsome or athleticenough to be a stock romantic adventure hero. He seems more eccentric thanheroic, with his bizarre stance, his head held up pugnaciously, his faceunlined in a peculiar bloated, waxen way. He's like a short, flabby tenorwandering around the stage and not singing: you wonder what he's doing there.).<p><p>In The Ugly American (1963) once again he is very funny as he sets thecharacter--a pipe-smoking businessman-ambassador who parries a Senatesubcommittee with high-toned clipped speech and epigrammatic sophistication.When he plays an articulate role, it is already rather a stunt, and in this onehe is talking about personal dignity and standards of proper behavior. Hisrestraint becomes a source of amusement because he is the chief exponent of theuncouth, the charged. Even his bull neck, so out of character, adds to the jokeHis comedy is volatile. It has the unpredictable element that has always beenpart of his excitement at any moment we may be surprised, amazed. When hesubmerges himself in the role, the movie dies on the screen.<p><p>Brando is never so American as when his English or foreign accent is thickest.It's a joke like a child's impersonation of a foreigner, overplaying thedifference, and he offers us complicity in his accomplishments at pretending tobe gentlemen or foreigners. What is funny about these roles is that they seemforeign to the Brando the audience feels it knows. When he does rough, coarseAmerican serviceman comedy, as in Bedtime Story, he is horribly nothing (exceptfor one farcical sequence when he impersonates a mad Hapsburg). Worse thannothing, because when his vulnerability is gone, his animal grace goes too, andhe is left without even the routine handsomeness of his inferiors.<p><p>He had already implicated us in his amusement at his roles earlier in hiscareer, in 1954 with his Napoleon in Desiree, in 1957 with his hilariousSouthern gentleman-officer in Sayonara, but these could still be thought of ascommercial interludes, the bad luck of the draw. Now he doesn't draw anythingelse. Is it just bad luck, or is it that he and so many of our greatest talentsmust play out their "creative" lives with a stacked deck?<p><p>It is easy these days to "explain" the absence of roles worth playing byreferring to the inroads of television and the end of the studio system. Ofcourse, there's some truth in all this. But Brando's career illustratessomething much more basic: the destruction of meaning in movies; and this isnot a new phenomenon, nor is it specially linked to television or other newfactors. The organic truth of American movie history is that the new theme orthe new star that gives vitality to the medium is widely imitated and quicklyexhausted before the theme or talent can develop. The industry makes tricks outof what was once done for love.<p><p>What's left of the rebel incarnate is what we see of Brando in the 1965Morituri: his principal charm is his apparent delight in his own cleverness.Like many another great actor who has become fortune's fool, he plays the greatham. He seems as pleased with the lines as if he'd just thought them up. Hegives the best ones a carefully timed double take so that we, too, can savorhis cleverness and the delight of his German accent. And what else is there todo with the role? If his presence did not give it the extra dimension ofcomedy, it would be merely commonplace.<p><p>In Morituri all we need is one look at the cynical aesthete Brando in hisescapist paradise, telling us that he's "out of it," that war never solvesanything, and we know that he's going to become the greatest warrior of themall. It can be argued that this hurdle of apathy or principle or convictions tobe overcome gives a character conflict and makes his ultimate action moresignificant. Theoretically, this would seem to explain the plot mechanism, butas it works, no matter how absurd the terms in which the initial idealism orcynicism or social rejection is presented (as in such classic movie examples ofcharacter reformation as Casablanca, To Have and Have Not, Stalag 17), it isthe final, socially acceptable "good" behavior which seems fantasy, fairy tale,unbelievable melodrama--in brief, fake. And the initial attitudes to beovercome often seem to have a lot of strength; indeed, they are likely to bewhat drew us to the character in the first place, what made him pass for aprotagonist.<p><p>In Morituri, as in movies in general, there is rarely a difference shown,except to bring it back to the "norm." The high-minded, like the Quakers inHigh Noon or Friendly Persuasion, are there only to violate their convictions.They must be brought down low to common impulses, just as the low cynicalmaterialists must be raised high to what are supposed to be our shared ideals.This democratic leveling of movies is like a massive tranquilizer. The moreirregular the hero, the more offbeat, the more necessary it is for him to turnsquare in the finale.<p><p>Brando's career is a larger demonstration of the same principle at work in massculture; but instead of becoming normal, he (like Norman Mailer) became aneccentric, which in this country means a clown, possibly the only way left topreserve some kind of difference.<p><p>When you're larger than life you can't just be brought down to normalcy. It'seasier to get acceptance by caricaturing your previous attitudes andaspirations, by doing what the hostile audience already has been doing to you.Why should Bette Davis let impersonators on television make a fool of her whenshe can do it herself and reap the rewards of renewed audience acceptance?<p><p>Perhaps Brando has been driven to this self-parody so soon because of hisimaginative strength and because of that magnetism that makes him so compellingan expression of American conflicts. His greatness is in a range that is toodisturbing to be encompassed by regular movies. As with Bette Davis, as withJohn Barrymore, even when he mocks himself, the self he mocks is moreprodigious than anybody else around. It's as if the hidden reserves of powerhave been turned to irony. Earlier, when his roles were absurd, there was adash of irony; now it's taken over: the nonconformist with no roles to playplays with his roles. Brando is still the most exciting American actor on thescreen. The roles may not be classic, but the actor's dilemma is.<p><p>Emerson outlined the American artist's way of life a century ago--"Thou mustpass for a fool for a long season." We used to think that the season meant onlyyouth, before the artist could prove his talent, make his place, achievesomething. Now it is clear that for screen artists, and perhaps not only forscreen artists, youth is, relatively speaking, the short season; the long oneis the degradation after success.<p><p>--------------------<p>Copyright 1966, Pauline Kael.<p><p>Pauline Kael is the author of FOR KEEPS: Thirty Years at the Movies, publishedby Dutton.<p><p>					<!--DROPCAP-->													<!--INSERT TEXT UP TO													HERE--></blockquote>												<!-- end article --><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br>			<!--NAVIGATION BUTTONS--><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

Dwight Frye's appearance on the screen had us suddenly squealing andshrieking, and it was obvious that old vampire movies were part of our commonexperience. We talked about the famous ones, Murnau's Nosferatu and Dreyer'sVampyr, and we began to get fairly involved in the lore of the genre--thestrategy of the bite, the special earth for the coffins, the stake through theheart versus the rays of the sun as disposal methods, the cross as vampirerepellent, et al. We had begun to surprise each other  by the affectionate,nostalgic tone of our mock erudition when the youngest person present, aninstructor in English, said, in clear, firm tone, "The Beast with Five Fingersis the greatest horror picture I've ever seen." Stunned that so bright a youngman could display such shocking taste, preferring a Warner, Brothers fortiesmediocrity to the classics, I gasped, "But why?" And he answered, "Because it'scompletely irrational. It doesn't make any sense, and that's the trueterror."<p><p>Upset by his neat little declaration--existentialism in a nutshell--by the calmmatter-of-factness of it, and by the way the others seemed to take it forgranted, I wanted to pursue the subject. But O. Henry's remark "Conversation inTexas is seldom continuous" applies to California, too. Dracula had ended, anthe conversation shifted to other, more "serious" subjects.<p><p>But his attitude, which had never occurred to me, helped explain some of myrecent moviegoing experiences. I don mean that I agree that The Beast with FiveFingers is a great horror film, but that his enthusiasm for the horror thatcannot be rationalized by the mythology and rules of the horror game related toaudience reactions that had been puzzling me.<p><p> Last year I had gone to see a famous French film, Georges Franju's EyesWithout a Face, which had arrived in San Francisco in a dubbed version calledThe Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus and was playing on a double-horror bill in ahuge Market Street theater. It was Saturday night and the theater, which holds2646, was so crowded I had trouble finding a seat.<p><p>Even dubbed, Eyes Without a Face, which Franju called a "poetic fantasy," isaustere and elegant: the exquisite photography is by the great Shuftan, themusic by Maurice Jarre, the superb gowns by Givenchy. It's a symbolist attackon science and the ethics of medicine, and though I thought this attack assimpleminded in its way as the usual young poet's denunciation of war orcommerce, it is in some peculiar way a classic of horror.<p><p>Pierre Brasseur, as a doctor, experiments systematically, removing the faces ofbeautiful young kidnaped women, trying to graft them onto the ruined head ofhis daughter. He keeps failing, the girls are destroyed and yet he persists--insome terrible parody of the scientific method. In the end, the daughter--stillonly eyes without a face--liberates the dogs on which he also experiments andthey tear off his head.<p><p>It's both bizarrely sophisticated (with Alida Valli as his mistress doing thekidnaping in a black leather coat, recalling the death images from Cocteau'sOrpheus) and absurdly naive. Franju's style is almost as purified as RobertBresson's, and although I dislike the mixture of austerity and mysticism withblood and gore, it produced its effect--a vague, floating, almost lyric senseof horror, an almost abstract atmosphere, impersonal and humorless. It hasnothing like the fun of a good old horror satire like The Bride of Frankensteinwith Elsa Lanchester's hair curling electrically instead of just frizzing asusual, and Ernest Thesiger toying with mandrake roots and tiny ladies andgentlemen in glass jars. It's a horror film that takes itself very seriously,and even though I thought its intellectual pretensions silly, I couldn't shakeoff the exquisite, dread images.<p><p> But the audience seemed to be reacting to a different movie. They were sonoisy the dialogue was inaudible; they talked until the screen gave promise ofbloody ghastliness. Then the chatter subsided to rise again in noisy approvalof the gory scenes. When a girl in the film seemed about to be mutilated, ayoung man behind me jumped up and down and shouted encouragement. "Somebody'sgoing to get it," he sang out gleefully. The audience, which was, I'd judge,predominantly between fifteen and twenty-five, and at least a third feminine,was as pleased and excited by the most revolting, obsessive images as thatolder, mostly male audience is when the nudes appear in The Immoral Mr. Teas orNot Tonight, Henry. They'd gotten what they came for: they hadn't been cheated.But nobody seemed to care what the movie was about or be interested in thelogic of the plot--the reasons for the gore.<p><p>And audiences have seemed indifferent to incomprehensible sections in bigexpensive pictures. For example, how is it that the immense audience for TheBridge on the River Kwai, after all those hours of watching a story unfold,didn't express discomfort or outrage or even plain curiosity about what exactlyhappened at the end--which through bad direction or perhaps sloppy editing wentby too fast to be sorted out and understood. Was it possible that audiences nolonger cared if a film was so untidily put together that information crucial tothe plot or characterizations was obscure or omitted altogether? What EverHappened to Baby Jane? was such a mess that Time, after calling it "the year'sscariest, funniest and most sophisticated thriller," got the plot garbled.<p><p>In recent years, largely because of the uncertainty of producers about whatwill draw, films in production may shift from one script to another, or may befinally cut so that key sequences are omitted. And the oddity is that itdoesn't seem to matter to the audience. I couldn't tell what was going on inparts of 55 Days at Peking. I was flabbergasted when Cleopatra, with no hint orpreparation, suddenly demonstrated clairvoyant powers, only to dispense withthem as quickly as she had acquired them. The audience for The Cardinal canhave little way of knowing whose baby the priest's sister is having, or ofunderstanding how she can be in labor for days, screaming in a rooming house,without anybody hearing her. They might also be puzzled about how the priest'sargument against her marriage, which they have been told is the only Catholicposition, can, after it leads to her downfall and death, be casually dismissedas an error.<p><p>It would be easy to conclude that people go to see a "show" and just don'tworry if it all hangs together so long as they've got something to look at. ButI think it's more complicated than that: audiences used to have an almostrational passion for getting the story straight. They might prefer bad moviesto good ones, and the Variety list of "all-time top grossers" (such as TheGreatest Show on Earth and Going My Way) indicates that they did, but althoughthe movies might be banal or vulgar, they were rarely incoherent. A movie hadto tell some kind of story that held together: a plot had to parse. Some of theappreciation for the cleverness of, say, Hitchcock's early thrillers was thatthey distracted you from the loopholes, so that, afterwards, you could enjoythinking over how you'd been tricked and teased. Perhaps now "stories" havebecome too sane, too explicable, too commonplace for the large audiences whowant sensations and regard the explanatory connections as mere "filler"--thekind of stuff you sit through or talk through between jolts.<p><p>It's possible that television viewing, with all its breaks and cuts, and theinattention, except for action, and spinning the dial to find some action, ispartly responsible for destruction of the narrative sense--that delight infollowing a story through its complications to its conclusion, which is perhapsa child's first conscious artistic pleasure. The old staples ofentertainment--inoffensive genres like the adventure story or the musical orthe ghost story or the detective story--are no longer commercially safe formoviemakers, and it may be that audiences don't have much more than a TV spanof attention left: they want to be turned on and they spend most of their timeturning off. Something similar and related may be happening in reading tastesand habits: teen-agers that I meet have often read Salinger and some Orwell andLord of the Flies and some Joyce Cary and sometimes even Dostoyevsky, but theyare not interested in the "classic" English novels of Scott or Dickens, andwhat is more to the point, they don't read the Sherlock Holmes stories or eventhe modern detective fiction that in the thirties and forties was an acceptedpart of the shared experience of adolescents. Whatever the reasons--and theymust be more than TV, they must have to do with modern life and the sense ofurgency it produces--audiences can no longer be depended on to respond toconventional forms.<p><p>Perhaps they want much more from entertainment than the civilized, but limitedrational pleasures of genre pieces. More likely, and the box-office returnssupport this, they want something different. Audiences that enjoy the shocksand falsifications, the brutal series of titillations of a Mondo Cane, onethrill after another, don't care any longer about the conventions of the past,and are too restless and apathetic to pay attention to motivations andcomplications, cause and effect. They want less effort, more sensations, moreknobs to turn.<p><p>A decade ago, The Haunting, an efficient, professional and to all appearances"commercial" genre piece, might have made money. By the end of 1963, itsgrosses in the United States and Canada, according to Variety, were $700,000.This may be compared with $9,250,000 for Irma La Douce, $4,600,000 for TheBirds, $3,900,000 for 55 Days at Peking--all three, I think, much lessenjoyable movies, or to be more exact, terrible movies, and in varying degreespointless and incomprehensible. A detective genre piece, The List of AdrianMessenger, also incomparably better than the three films cited, and with atricky "star" selling campaign, grossed only $1,500,000. It's easy to imaginethat Robert Wise, after the energetic excesses of West Side Story, turned toThe Haunting for a safe, sane respite, and that John Huston, after wrestlingwith Freud, turned to an intriguing detective story like Adrian Messenger for alucrative, old-fashioned holiday. But what used to be safe seems now to befolly. How can audiences preoccupied with identity problems of their own worryabout a case of whodunit and why and how? Following clues may be too much of aneffort for those who, in the current teen-age phrase, "couldn't care less."They want shock treatment, not diversion, and it takes more than ghosts tofrighten them.<p><p>The Haunting is set in that pleasantly familiar "old dark house" that is itselfan evil presence, and is usually inhabited by ghosts or evil people. In ourchildhood imaginings, the unknowable things that have happened in old houses,and the whispers that someone may have died in them, make them mysterious,"dirty"; only the new house that has known no life or death is safe and clean.But so many stories have used the sinister dark housefrom-which-no-one-can-escape and its murky gardens for our ritual entertainmentthat we learn to experience the terrors as pleasurable excitations andreassuring reminders of how frightened we used to be before we learned our wayaround. In film, as in story, the ambiance is fear; the film specialty isgathering a group who are trapped and helpless. (Although the women are moreeasily frightened, the men are also powerless. Their superior strength doesn'tcount for much against unseen menaces: this may explain why the genre was oftenused for a male comedian--like Bob Hope in The Ghost Breakers. Russ Tamblynserves a similar but feeble cowardly-comic function in The Haunting.) Theaction is confined to the house and grounds (the maze); the town is usually faraway, just far enough away so that "nobody will hear you if you scream."<p><p>In recent years film festivals and art houses have featured a peculiar variantof the trapped-in-the-old-dark-house genre (Bunuel's The Exterminating Angel isthe classic new example), but the characters, or rather figures, are the undeador zombies of the vampire movies. "We live as in coffins frozen side by side ina garden"--Last Year at Marienbad. "I'm dead"--the heroine of II Mare. "They'reall dead in there"--the hostess describing the party of La Notte. Their vitaljuices have been sucked away, but they don't have the revealing marks on thethroat. We get the message: alienation drains the soul without leaving anymarks. Or, as Bergman says of his trilogy, "Most of the people in these threefilms are dead, completely dead. They don't know how to love or to feel anyemotions. They are lost because they can't reach anyone outside of themselves."This "art" variant is a message movie about failure of communication and lackof love and spiritual emptiness and all the rest of that. It's the closestthing we've got to a new genre but it has some peculiarities. The old darkhouse was simply there, but these symbolic decadent or sterile surroundings aresupposed to reflect the walking death of those within the maze. The charactersin the old dark house tried to solve the riddle of their imprisonment and triedto escape; even in No Exit the drama was in why the characters were there, butin the new hotel-in-hell movies the characters don't even want to get out ofthe maze--nor one surmises do the directors, despite their moralizing. Andaudiences apparently respond to these films as modern and relevant just becauseof this paralysis and inaction and minimal story line. If in the group at theolder dark house, someone was not who we thought he was, in the new dull partygatherings, it doesn't matter who anybody is (which is a new horror) .<p><p>Although The Haunting is moderately elegant and literate and expensive, and thedirector gussies things up with a Marienbadish piece of statuary that may ormay not be the key to something or other, it's basically a traditional ghoststory. There is the dedicated scientist who wants to contribute to science insome socially unacceptable or scientifically reproachable area--in this case toprove the supernatural powers of the house. (The scientist is, somewhatinexplicably, an anthropologist; perhaps Margaret Mead has set the precedentfor anthropologists to dabble in and babble on anything--so that the modernconcept of the anthropologist is like the old concept of the philosopher or,for that matter, the scientist.) And, in the expository style traditional forthe genre, he explains the lore and jargon of psychic research, meticulouslyseparating out ghost from poltergeist and so on. And of course the scientist,in the great tradition of Frankenstein, must have the abnormal or madassistant: the role that would once have belonged to Dwight Frye is heremodernized and becomes the Greenwich Village lesbian, Claire Bloom. And thereis the scientist's distraught wife who fears that her husband's brilliantcareer will be ruined, and so on. The chaste heroine, Julie Harris (like anupdated Helen Chandler, Dracula's anemic victim), is the movies' post-Freudianconcept of the virgin: repressed, hysterical, insane--the source of evil.<p><p>It wasn't a great movie but I certainly wouldn't have thought that it couldoffend anyone. Yet part of the audience at The Haunting wasn't merely bored, itwas hostile--as if the movie, by assuming interests they didn't have, made themfeel resentful or inferior. I've never felt this kind of audience hostilitytoward crude, bad movies. People are relaxed and tolerant about ghoulishquickies, grotesque shockers dubbed from Japan, and chopped-up Italianspectacles that scramble mythologies and pile on actions, one stupidity afteranother. Perhaps they prefer incoherent, meaningless movies because they arenot required to remember or connect. They can feel superior, contemptuous--asthey do toward television advertising. Even when it's a virtuoso triumph, theaudience is contemptuous toward advertising, because, after all, they seethrough it--they know somebody is trying to sell something. And because, like acheap movie obviously made to pry money out of them, that is all advertisingmeans, it's OK. But the few, scattered people at The Haunting were restless andtalkative, the couple sitting near me arguing--the man threatening to leave,the woman assuring him that something would happen. In their terms, they werecheated: nothing happened. And, of course, they missed what was happening allalong, perhaps because of nervous impatience or a primitive notion that thereal things are physical, perhaps because people take from art and from popularentertainment only what they want; and if they are indifferent to story andmotive and blank out on the connections, then a movie without physical actionor crass jokes or built-in sentimental responses has nothing for them. I amafraid that the young instructor in English spoke for his times, that there isno terror for modern audiences if a story is carefully worked out and follows atradition, even though the tradition was developed and perfected precisely tofrighten entertainingly.<p><p>No wonder that studios and producers are unsure what to do next, scanbest-seller lists for trends, consult audience-testing polls, anxiously chopout what a preview audience doesn't like. The New York Times chides therepresentatives of some seven companies who didn't want to invest in What EverHappened to Baby Jane? but how could businessmen, brought up to respect logicand a good commercial script, possibly guess that this confused mixture of lowcamp and Grand Guignol would delight the public?<p><p>And if I may return for a moment to that producer whom I left sunning himselfat the side of the pool--"Did you know that Irma La Douce is already thehighest-grossing comedy in film history?" he asked me at one point, not in thedroning voice of the civic-minded man discussing the cultural development ofthe community, but in the voice of someone who's really involved in what he'ssaying; "Yes," I said, "but is it even a comedy? It's a monstrous mutation."The producer shrugged his dark round shoulders helplessly: "Who knows what's acomedy any more?"<p><p>It is not just general audiences out for an evening's entertainment who seem tohave lost the narrative sense, or become indifferent to narrative. What I thinkare processes of structural disintegration are at work in all types of movies,and though it's obvious that many of the old forms were dead and had to bebroken through, it's rather scary to see what's happening--and not just at thebig picture-palaces. Art-house films are even more confusing. Why, at the endof Godard's My Life to Live, is the heroine shot, rather than the pimp that therival gang is presumably gunning for? Is she just a victim of bad marksmanship?If we express perplexity, we are likely to be told that we are missing theexistentialist point: it's simply fate, she had to die. But a cross-eyed fate?And why is there so little questioning of the organization of My Name Is Ivanwith its lyric interludes and patriotic sections so ill assembled that onemight think the projectionist had scrambled the reels? (They often do at arthouses, and it would seem that the more sophisticated the audience, the lesslikely that the error will be discovered. When I pointed out to a theatermanager that the women in Brink of Life were waiting for their babies afterthey had miscarried, he told me that he had been playing the film for two weeksand I was his first patron who wasn't familiar with Bergman's methods.) <p><p>The art-house audience accepts lack of clarity as complexity, acceptsclumsiness and confusion as "ambiguity" and as style. Perhaps even without thesupport of critics, they would accept incoherence just as the larger audiencedoes: they may feel that movies as incomprehensible as Viridiana are morerelevant to their experience, more true to their own feelings about life, andmore satisfying and complex than works they can understand.<p><p>I trust I won't be mistaken for the sort of boob who attacks ambiguity orcomplexity. I am interested in the change from the period when the meaning ofart and form in art was in making complex experience simple and lucid, as isstill the case in Knife in the Water or Bandits of Orgosolo, to the currentacceptance of art as technique, the technique which in a movie like ThisSporting Life makes a simple, though psychologically confused, story lookcomplex, and modern because inexplicable.<p><p>It has become easy--especially for those who consider "time" a problem and agreat theme--to believe that fast editing, out of normal sequence, which makesit difficult, or impossible, for the audience to know if any action is takingplace, is somehow more "cinematic" than a consecutively told story. For a halfcentury movies have, when necessary, shifted action in time and place and thedirectors generally didn't think it necessary to slap us in the face with eachcut or to call out, "Look what I can do!" Yet people who should know betterwill tell you how "cinematic" The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner orThis Sporting Life is--as if fiddling with the time sequence was good initself--proof that the "medium" is really being used. Perhaps, after a fewdecades of indoctrination in high art, they are convinced that a movie iscinematic when they don't understand what's going on. This Sporting Life, whichDerek Hill, among others, has called the best feature ever made in England,isn't gracefully fragmented, it's smashed. The chunks are so heavy andhumorless and, in an odd way, disturbing, that we can tell the film is meant tobe bold, powerful, tragic.<p><p>There's a woman writer I'd be tempted to call a three-time loser: she'sCatholic, Communist, and lesbian; but she comes on more like a triple threat.She's in with so many groups that her books are rarely panned. I thought of herwhen I read the reviews of This Sporting Life: this film has it made in so manyways, it carries an identity card with all the outsiders. The hero is"bewildered," the heroine "bruised" and "afraid of life," the brutal rugbygames are possibly a "microcosm of a corrupt society," and the film murkilysuggests all sorts of passion and protest, like a group of demonstratorssinging "We Shall Overcome" and leaving it to you to fill in your own set ofinjustices. For Show magazine, "The football scenes bear the aspect of a savagerite, with the spectators as participants hungry for sacrifice. The love story. . . is simply another kind of scrimmage, a battle between two people whocannot communicate . . ." For the New York Times, the film "translates theconfusions and unrequited longings of the angry young men and women of our timeinto memorable universal truths." (I wish the reviewer would spell out one ortwo of them for us.) The Times has an unusual interpretation of the love story:"The woman . . . only succumbs to him physically and the real roots he seeksare unattainable." This reminds me of my confusion as a schoolgirl when a jazzmusician who had been introduced to me during the break called out "Dig youlater" as he went back to the stand.<p>In the Observer, Penelope Gilliatt offers extraordinary praise: "This SportingLife is a stupendous film. It has a blow like a fist. I've never seen anEnglish picture that gave such expression to the violence and the capacity forpain that there is in the English character. It is there in Shakespeare, inMarlowe, in Lawrence and Orwell and Hogarth, but not in our cinema like thisbefore. This Sporting Life is hard to write about because everything importantabout it is really subverbal." But then so are trees and animals and cities.Isn't it precisely the artist's task to give form to his experience and thecritic's task to verbalize on how this has been accomplished? She goes on towrite of the hero, "The events almost seem to be happening to him in the dark.Half of them are told while he is under dentist's gas, in flashback, which is aclumsy device if one is telling a story but the natural method if one issearching around a character." English dental hygiene is notorious; still,isn't telling a story, with or without gas and flashbacks, a pretty good"natural" method of searching around a characters? But something more seems tobe involved: "The black subjective spirit of the film is overpowering. Itfloods the sound track, which often has a peculiar resonance as though it werehappening inside one's own head." Sort of a sunken cathedral effect? The bellsare clanging in the reviewers' heads, but what's happening on the screen?<p><p>In one way or another, almost all the enthusiasts for a film like this one willtell you that it doesn't matter, that however you interpret the film, you willbe right (though this does not prevent some of them from working out elaborateinterpretations of Marienbad or The Eclipse or Viridiana). Walter Lassally saysthat "Antonioni's oblique atmospheric statements and Bunuel's symbolism, forexample, cannot be analyzed in terms of good or bad . . . for they contain, inaddition to any obvious meanings, everything that the viewer may read intothem." Surely he can read the most onto a blank screen?<p><p>There's not much to be said for this theory except that it's mighty democratic.Rather pathetically, those who accept this Rorschach-blot approach to moviesare hesitant and uneasy about offering reactions. They should be reassured bythe belief that whatever they say is right, but as it refers not to the filmbut to them (turning criticism into autobiography) they are afraid ofself-exposure. I don't think they really believe the theory--it's a sort oftemporary public convenience station. More and more people come out of a movieand can't tell you what they've seen, or even whether they liked it.<p><p>An author like David Storey may stun them with information like "[This SportingLife] works purely in terms of feeling. Only frivolous judgments can be madeabout it in conventional terms of style." Has he discovered a new method ofconveying feeling without style? Or has he simply found the arrogance tofrustrate normal responses? No one wants to have his capacity for feelingquestioned, and if a viewer tries to play it cool, and discuss This SportingLife in terms of corrupt professional football, he still won't score on thatmuddy field: there are no goalposts. Lindsay Anderson, who directed, says,"This Sporting Life is not a film about sport. In fact, I wouldn't really callit a story picture at all.... We have tried to make a tragedy . . . we weremaking a film about something unique." A tragedy without a story is unique allright: a disaster.<p><p>In movies, as in other art forms, if you are interested only in technique or ifyou reject technique, the result is just about the same: if you have nothing toexpress it is very much like thinking you have so much to express that youdon't know how to say it. Something related to absorption in technique isinvolved in the enthusiasm of young people for what is called "the New AmericanCinema," though these films are often made by those who reject craftsmanship aswell as meaning. They tend to equate technique with science and those whoproduced the Bomb. This approach, which is a little like the attack onscientific method in Eyes Without a Face, is used to explain why they must makemovies without taking time to learn how. They're in a hurry, and anyway,technique might corrupt them.<p><p>The spokesmen for this cinema attack rationality as if it were the enemy of art("as/ the heavy Boots of Soldiers and Intellect/ march across the/ flowerfieldsof subconscious" and so forth by Jonas Mekas). They have composed a ratherstrange amalgam in which reason = lack of feeling and imagination = hostilityto art = science = the enemy = Nazis and police = the Bomb. Somewhere along theline, criticism is also turned into an enemy of art. The group produces a kindof euphoric publicity which is published in place of criticism, but soon it mayhave semi-intellectually respectable critics. In the Nation of April 13, 1964,Susan Sontag published an extraordinary essay on Jack Smith's Flaming Creaturescalled "A Feast for Open Eyes" in which she enunciates a new criticalprinciple: "Thus Smith's crude technique serves, beautifully, the sensibilityembodied in Flaming Creatures--a sensibility based on indiscriminateness,without ideas, beyond negation." I think in treating indiscriminateness as avalue, she has become a real swinger. Of course we can reply that if anythinggoes, nothing happens, nothing works. But this is becoming irrelevant. In LosAngeles, among the independent film makers at their midnight screenings I wastold that I belonged to the older generation, that Agee-alcohol generation theycalled it, who could not respond to the new films because I didn't take pot orLSD and so couldn't learn just to accept everything. This narcotic approach oftorpid acceptance, which is much like the lethargy of the undead in thosefailure-of-communication movies, may explain why those films have seemed so"true" to some people (and why the directors' moralistic messages sound sofalse). This attitude of rejecting critical standards has the dubious advantageof accepting everyone who says he is an artist as an artist and conferring onall his "noncommercial" productions the status of art. Miss Sontag is on tosomething and if she stays on and rides it like Slim Pickens, it's the end ofcriticism--at the very least.<p><p> It's ten years since Dylan Thomas answered Maya Deren's call for a new poetryof film with "I'm not at all sure that I want such a thing, myself, as a poeticfilm. I think films fine as they are, if only they were better . . . I likestories, you know --I like to see something going on." Movies have changed inthese ten years, disastrously in the last few years; they have become"cinema."<p><p>At the art-house level, critics and audiences haven't yet discovered the beautyof indiscriminateness, but there's a lot of talk about "purely visualcontent"--which might be called the principle of ineffability. Time callsResnais's Muriel "another absorbing exercise in style." Dwight Macdonald callsMarienbad "'pure' cinema, a succession of images enjoyable in themselves." AndRichard Roud, who was responsible (and thus guilty) for the film selection atthe New York Film Festivals, goes all the way: films like La Notte, he says,provide an "experience in pure form."<p><p>Once matters reach this plane, it begins to seem almost unclean to raise issuesabout meaning and content and character, or to question the relevance of asequence, the quality of a performance. Someone is sure to sneer, "Are youlooking for a paraphrasable content? A film, like a poem, *is*." Or smilepityingly and remind you that Patroni Griffi had originally intended to call IIMare "Landscape with Figures"; doesn't that tell you how you should look at it?It does indeed, and it's not my idea of a good time. After a few dismalexperiences we discover that when we are told to admire a film for its pureform or its structure, it is going to exhibit irritating, confusing, andostentatious technique, which will, infuriatingly, be all we can discover init. And if we should mention that we enjoy the dramatic and narrative elementsin movies, we are almost certain to be subjected to the contemptuous remark,"Why does cinema have to *mean* something? Do you expect a work by Bach to*mean* something?"<p>The only way to answer this is by some embarrassingly basic analysis, pointingout that words, unlike tones, refer to something and that movie images arerarely abstract or geometric designs, and that when they include people andplaces and actions, they have implications, associations. Robbe-Grillet, thescenarist of Marienbad, may say that the film is a pure construction, an objectwithout reference to anything outside itself, and that the existence of the twocharacters begins when the film begins and ends ninety-three minutes later,but, of course, we are not born when we go in to see a movie--though we maywant to die by the time we leave. And we can't even leave Marienbad behindbecause, although it isn't particularly memorable (it isn't even particularlyoffensive), a kind of creeping Marienbadism is the new aesthetics of "poetic"cinema. This can only sound like pedantry to those interested in "pure" art whotend to consider analysis as an enemy, anyway (though, many of them are in it).The very same people who say that a movie shouldn't mean anything, that art isbeyond meaning, also say that it must be seen over and over again because itreveals more meaning with subsequent viewings. And although the structure ofmany of the new films is somehow supposed to be the art, we are frowned upon ifwe question the organization of the material. There is nothing, finally, thatwe are allowed to question or criticize. We are supposed only to interpret--andthat as we wish.<p><p>The leaders of this new left-wing formalism are Resnais, who gives us hisvision of a bomb-shattered, fragmented universe, and Antonioni, the masterpractitioner of the fallacy of expressive form, who sets out to demonstratethat boredom (and its accompanying eroticism) is the sickness of our time (butdoesn't explain how it helps to add to it). If their characters have a curiousway of using their sophisticated vacuity as a come-on, are they not in theircreators' image? They make assignations (as in The Eclipse), but nobodycomes.<p>The movie houses may soon look as desolate as II Mare--set in Capri in winter.I've never seen so many people sleeping through movies as at Lincoln Center: nowonder there is talk of "cinema" achieving the social status of opera. A fewmore seasons of such art and it will be evidence of your interest in cultureand your sense of civic responsibility if you go to the movies.<p><p>The "techniques" of such films are so apparent, so obtrusive, that they mayeasily be assumed to be "advanced," "modern," "new." It's perfectly true youdon't come out of an older movie like Renoir's La Grande Illusion, orFlaherty's Man of Aran, or Bergman's Smiles of a Summer Night saying, "Whattechnique!" Nor do you come out of a concert by Serkin exclaiming about histechnique--you're thinking of the music. But those who adore Jose Iturbi alwayssay, "What technique!"; what else is there to respond to? And thecomment--which means how fast he can play or how ostentatiously--is not so veryfar from the admiration for Antonioni or Torre Nilsson or Bresson's Trial ofJoan of Arc (though they are generally admired for how slow they can play).<p><p>My attitude to what is happening to movies is more than a little ambivalent. Idon't think that my own preferences or the preferences of others for coherenceand wit and feeling are going to make much difference. Movies are going topieces; they're disintegrating, and the something called cinema is not moviesraised to an art but rather movies diminished, movies that look "artistic."Movies are being stripped of all the "nonessentials"--that is to say, faces,actions, details, stories, places--everything that makes them entertaining andjoyful. They are even being stripped of the essentials--light (The Eclipse),sound (The Silence), and movement in some of the New American Cinema films(there is sure to be one called Stasis). It's obvious that the most talentedfilm artists and the ones most responsive to our time and the attitudes ofCamus and Sartre are the ones moving in this direction. The others, thosetrying to observe the older conventions, are usually (though not always) banal,trivial, ludicrously commercial, and out of touch, somehow. It is the highesttalents, the most dedicated, who are driven to the dead end of "pure"cinema--just as our painters are driven to obliterate the image, and adramatist like Beckett to reduce words to sounds.<p><p>Cinema, I suspect, is going to become so rarefied, so private in meaning, andso lacking in audience appeal that in a few years the foundations will bedesperately and hopelessly trying to bring it back to life, as they are nowdoing with theater. The parallel course is, already, depressingly apparent.Clancy Sigal's (admiring) account of Beckett's Endgame might have been writtenof Bergman's The Silence:<p>Endgame's two main characters . . . occupy a claustrophobic space and a deeplyambiguous relationship.... Outside, the world is dead of some greatcatastrophe.... The action of the play mainly comprises anxious bickeringbetween the too principal characters. Eventually, Clov dresses for the road toleave Hamm, and Hamm prepares for death, though we do not see the moment ofparting . . . none of the actors is quite sure what the play is about, Beckettaffects complete ignorance of the larger implications. "I only know what's onthe page," he says with a friendly gesture.<p><p>Is Beckett leading the way or is it all in the air? His direction that thewords of Play should be spoken so fast that they can't be understood isparalleled by Resnais's editing of Muriel so fast that you can't keep track ofwhat's going on. Penelope Gilliatt writes, "You may have to go to the film atleast twice, as I did, before the warmth of it seeps through . . ."; Becketthas already anticipated the problem and provided the answer with the stagedirection, "Repeat play exactly."<p><p>When movies, the only art which everyone felt free to enjoy and have opinionsabout, lose their connection with song and dance, drama, and the novel, whenthey become cinema, which people fear to criticize just as they fear to saywhat they think of a new piece of music or a new poem or painting, they willbecome another object of academic study and "appreciation," and will soon be anobject of excitement only to practitioners of the "art." Although L'Avventurais a great film, had I been present at Cannes in 1960, where Antonionidistributed his explanatory statement, beginning, "There exists in the worldtoday a very serious break between science on the one hand . . . ,"  I mighteasily have joined in the hisses, which he didn't really deserve until thefollowing year, when La Notte revealed that he'd begun to believe his ownexplanations--thus making liars of us all.<p><p>When we see Dwight Macdonald's cultural solution applied to film, when we seethe prospect that movies will become a product for "Masscult" consumption,while the "few who care" will have their High Culture cinema, who wants to takethe high road? There is more energy, more originality, more excitement, moreart in American kitsch like Gunga Din, Easy Living, the Rogers and Astairepictures like Swingtime and Top Hat, in Strangers on a Train, His Girl Friday,The Crimson Pirate, Citizen Kane, The Lady Eve, To Have and Have Not, TheAfrican Queen, Singin' in the Rain, Sweet Smell of Success, or more recently,The Hustler, Lolita, The Manchurian Candidate, Hud, Charade, than in thepresumed "High Culture" of Hiroshima Mon Amour, Marienbad, La Notte, TheEclipse, and the Torre Nilsson pictures. As Nabokov remarked, "Nothing is moreexhilarating than Philistine vulgarity."<p><p>Regrettably, one of the surest signs of the Philistine is his reverence for thesuperior tastes of those who put him down. Macdonald believes that "a work ofHigh Culture, however inept, is an expression of feelings, ideas, tastes,visions that are idiosyncratic and the audience similarly responds to them asindividuals." No. The "pure" cinema enthusiast who doesn't react to a film butfeels he should, and so goes back to it over and over, is not responding as anindividual but as a compulsive good pupil determined to appreciate what hiscultural superiors say is "art." Movies are on their way into academia whenthey're turned into a matter of duty: a mistake in judgment isn't fatal, buttoo much anxiety about judgment is. In this country, respect for High Cultureis becoming a ritual.<p><p>If debased art is kitsch, perhaps kitsch may be redeemed by honest vulgarity,may become art. Our best work transforms kitsch, makes art out of it; that isthe peculiar greatness and strength of American movies, as Godard in Breathlessand Truffaut in Shoot the Piano Player recognize. Huston's The Maltese Falconis a classic example. Our first and greatest film artist D. W. Griffith was amaster of kitsch: the sentiment and melodrama in his films are much moreintegral to their greatness than the critics who lament Griffith's lack of mind( ! ) perceive.<p><p>The movies are still where it happens, not for much longer perhaps, but themovies are still the art form that uses the material of our lives and the artform that we use. I am not suggesting that we want to see new and biggerremakes of the tired old standbys of the film repertory: who wants to see thenew Cimarron, another Quo Vadis? And meanings don't have to be spread out forus like a free-lunch counter. There are movies that are great experiences likeLong Day's Journey into Night, and just a few years back there were movieswhich told good stories--movies like The Treasure of Sierra Madre, From Here toEternity, The Nun's Story.<p><p>People go to the movies for the various ways they express the experiences ofour lives, and as a means of avoiding and postponing the pressures we feel.This latter function of art--generally referred to disparagingly asescapism--may also be considered as refreshment, and in terms of modern bigcity life and small town boredom, it may be a major factor in keeping ussane.<p><p>In the last few years there has appeared a new kind of filmgoer: he isn'tinterested in movies but in cinema. A great many of the film makers are in thisgroup: they've never gone to movies much and they don't care about them.They're interested in what they can do in the medium, not in what has beendone. This is, of course, their privilege, though I would suggest that it mayexplain why they have such limited approaches to film. I'm more puzzled by thelarge numbers of those who are looking for importance in cinema. For example, adoctor friend called me after he'd seen The Pink Panther to tell me I needn't"bother" with that one, it was just slapstick. When I told him I'd already seenit and had a good time at it, he was irritated; he informed me that a movieshould be more than a waste of time, it should be an exercise of taste thatwill enrich your life. Those looking for importance are too often contemptuousof the crude vitality of American films, though this crudity is not alwaysoffensive, and may represent the only way that energy and talent andinventiveness can find an outlet, can break through the planned standardizationof mass entertainment. It has become a mark of culture to revere the oldslapstick (the Mack Sennett two-reelers and early Chaplins that aren't reallyas great as all that) and put down the new. But in a movie as shopworn as Who'sBeen Sleeping in My Bed? there is, near the end, an almost inspired satiricalstriptease by Carol Burnett. The Nutty Professor is too long and repetitive,but Jerry Lewis has some scenes that hold their own with the silent classics. Ienjoyed The Prize, which opens badly but then becomes a lively, blatantentertainment; but there's no point in recommending it to someone who wants hislife enriched. I couldn't persuade friends to go see Charade, which although nomore than a charming confectionery trifle was, I think, probably the bestAmerican film of last year--as artificial and enjoyable in its way as The BigSleep. The word had got around that it isn't important, that it isn't serious,that it doesn't do anything for you.<p><p>Our academic bureaucracy needs something alive to nourish it and movies stillhave a little blood which the academics can drain away. In the West several ofthe academic people I know who have least understanding of movies were suddenlyinterested by Laurence Alloway's piece called "Critics in the Dark" inEncounter. By suggesting that movie criticism had never gotten into the righthands--i.e., theirs, and by indicating projects, and by publishing in theprestigious Encounter, Alloway indicated large vistas of respectability forfuture film critics. Perhaps also they were drawn to his condescending approachto movies as a pop art. Many academics have always been puzzled that Agee couldcare so much about movies. Alloway, by taking the position that Agee's caringwas a maladjustment, re-established their safe, serene worlds in which if a mangets excited about an idea or an issue, they know there's something the matterwith him. It's not much consolation, but I think the cinema the academics willbe working over will be the cinema they deserve.<p><p>--------------------<p>Copyright 1964, Pauline Kael. <p><p>Pauline Kael is the author of FOR KEEPS: Thirty Years at the Movies, availablefrom Dutton.<p><p>"Are Movies Going to Pieces" first published in the December, 1964, issue ofThe Atlantic Monthly, is currently in print in I LOST IT AT THE MOVIES, MarionBoyars, Pubs., Inc., New York. 1993.<p><p>						<!--DROPCAP-->													<!--INSERT TEXT UP TO													HERE--></blockquote>												<!-- end article --><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br>			<!--NAVIGATION BUTTONS--><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../home.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>Copyright &copy; 1995 by The Atlantic Monthly Company.

	<center><i><font size=4>As the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Thomas Jefferson's birth

approaches, a Jefferson scholar reflects on Jefferson 's life -- and in particular on the

enigma at its core: that a slave holder should be the nation 's most eloquent

is to appreciate the perils of "presentism " and the difficulties that may

	<font size=5>"T</font>ODAY, MAKES YESTERDAY MEAN." <P>

	

	 Emily 

	 Dickinson's gnomic utterance contains at

least one undoubted truth -- that the perspectives of the present invariably

color the meanings we ascribe to the past. Nothing confirms this so readily as

the changing reputations of historical figures, whose status often appears

indexed to present-day preoccupations. It may be inevitable that every age

should refashion its historical heroes in a contemporary idiom, but doing so

carries with it an obvious and inherent danger. In imposing Today's meanings on

Yesterday, we run the risk of distorting it -- whether willfully, to suit our

own purposes, or unintentionally, by unwarranted assumptions and because of

meager information. In this way we lose track of what might be considered the

obverse of Emily Dickinson's remark: that Yesterday has meanings of its own

that are prior to and necessarily independent of Today's.<p>



	Thomas Jefferson is one of the few historical Americans who need no

introduction. Even the most abbreviated knowledge of American history, at home

or abroad, includes the author of the  Declaration of Independence. Identified

around the world with democracy and human rights, Jefferson's name and words

have been invoked for two hundred years in the cause of freedom and political

reform. But here in his own country, where the name synonymous with democracy

is exhibited everywhere--on counties, cities, schools, streets, and every

imaginable form of institution, business, and product--it sometimes seems that

the man himself is receding from view, and that what is commonly thought and

said about him gets harder and harder to reconcile with the great national

hero. With the approach of the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of his

birth, in 1743, it seems appropriate to note some of the ways in which Thomas

Jefferson is remembered by the American public and to examine the historical

lens through which the man and his contributions are seen.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>O</font>NLY a generation ago Jefferson was still considered to be and treated as an

object of veneration, so closely identified with the spirit of America as to

constitute a problem for the historian. In 1960 Merrill D. Peterson confronted

this problem in one of the most revealing works of Jefferson scholarship, <I>The

Jefferson Image in the American Mind</I>, which surveys what Jefferson has meant to

succeeding generations of Americans. "Where the object is Jefferson," Peterson

wrote, 



<BLOCKQUOTE>the historian's obligation to historical truth is compromised, in some

degree, by his sense of obligation to the

Jefferson symbol. Jefferson occupies such an important place in the symbolical

architecture of this nation that the search for the elusive himself from the

vaunted summit, Objectivity, must not he allowed to empty the symbol of meaning

for "Jefferson's children."</BLOCKQUOTE><p>



	It is a measure of the change that has occurred in the past thirty years that

the one thing Jefferson's children nowadays are most likely to associate with

him, apart from his authorship of the Declaration of Independence, is a sexual

liaison with one of his slaves, Sally 

Hemings.  College teachers are often

dismayed to discover that many if not most of their students now regard this as

an accepted fact. But this is not all. In the prevailing ethos of the sexual

revolution, Jefferson's supposed liaison is widely received with equanimity and

seems to earn him nothing more reproachful than a knowing smile. For most, such

a liaison is apparently not objectionable, and for some, its presumed reality

actually seems to work in his favor, showing him to have been not a stuffy

moralist but a man who cleverly managed to appear respectable while secretly

carrying on an illicit relationship. In effect, something that before the 1960s

would have been universally considered a shameful blot on Jefferson's character

has become almost an asset. Confirming this state of affairs is the case of a

prominent black civil-rights leader who complained not long ago that

Jefferson's alleged relationship with Hemings is not forthrightly acknowledged

by the proprietors of Monticello, Jefferson's residence, and who frankly

confessed that this liaison had for him a positive effect in showing that,

though a slave holder, Jefferson was well disposed toward black people.<p>



	Although the charge that Jefferson had fathered several children by one of his

slaves was first made public in his lifetime, by a vindictive journalist and

office-seeker, James Callender, it was believed mainly by those who disparaged

Jefferson for political reasons and was not credited by Jefferson scholars or

the public at large. But that began to change in 1974, when Fawn M. Brodie

published a widely read book on Jefferson in which she attempted to establish

the truth of Callender's charge as a prime biographical fact. Brodie's thesis

about Jefferson and Hemings is an embellished and controversial reading of the

evidence, but what is more significant in the present context is that her story

was well geared to the dispositions of her audience. She insisted that her

object was not to pillory Jefferson or to make him out as a moral monster but

merely to depict him as a man. If, as a widower, he fell in love with a

beautiful slave girl and took her as a mistress when she was fourteen years

old, it was "not scandalous debauchery with an innocent slave victim," she

assured us, "but rather a serious passion that brought Jefferson and the slave

woman much private happiness over a period lasting thirty-eight years."

Brodie's benign version of the story has proved persuasive, and where previous

versions had depicted such behavior as scandalous, hypocritical, or shameful,

Jefferson and Hemings are represented as a pair of happy lovers, bravely

defying the conventions of a sexually puritanical and racist society.<p>



	Compelling as this picture has proved to the American public, most Jefferson

scholars and historians have remained unpersuaded. It is true that Jefferson

was extremely protective of his personal life and went to considerable lengths

to keep it private, but it does not follow, as Brodie would have us believe,

that he must therefore have had something to hide. In accounting for

Jefferson's behavior in the context of his own time, rather than ours, it is

difficult for knowledgeable authorities to reconcile a liaison with Hemings

with much else that is known about him. Jefferson implicitly denied the charge,

and such evidence as exists about the paternity of Hemings's children points

not to Jefferson but to his nephews. It is, of course, impossible to prove a

negative, but the real problem with Brodie's interpretation is that it doesn't

fit Jefferson. If he did take advantage of Hemings and father her children over

a period of twenty years, he was acting completely out of character and

violating his own standards of honor and decency. For a man who took questions

of morality and honor very seriously, such a hypocritical liaison would have

been a constant source of shame and guilt. For his close-knit family, who

worshipped him and lived too near to him to have been ignorant of such an

arrangement, it would have been a moral tragedy of no small dimensions.<p>



	But haunted as he was by other troubles and difficulties, there is no sign of

this sort of shame or guilt in Jefferson's life. That is why Brodie must

present Jefferson and Hemings as a happy couple and their supposed life

together as giving satisfaction and lasting pleasure. And whereas there are

grounds for suspecting a liaison, such as the terms of Jefferson's will and the

testimony of Hemings's son Madison, there are no grounds whatever for believing

in what Brodie called the "private happiness" enjoyed by Jefferson and Hemings.

That is pure speculation. Because Brodie's thesis deals in such unwarranted

assumptions, the great Jefferson biographer  Dumas Malone  regarded it as

"without historical foundation." But what makes it possible for the American

public to take the Sally Hemings story to heart, even more than the suspicious

circumstances, seems to be a prevailing presentism.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>"P</font>RESENTISM" is the term that historians use for applying contemporary or

otherwise inappropriate standards to the past. An awkward term at best, it

nevertheless names a malaise that currently plagues American discussions of

anything and everything concerning the past: the widespread inability to make

appropriate allowances for prevailing historical conditions. The issue of

presentism is hardly new, but it has perhaps been amplified of late by the

debunking and revisionist spirit of the times and the effect this has had on

public perceptions. As the uncritically positive and unabashedly patriotic

approach that for so long characterized the teaching of American history in the

public schools has abated, the emphasis has steadily shifted to the problems

and failures of the past. The saga of the glories of the old West has thus

given way to a saga of exploitation and greed. Pride in conquering the

wilderness has yielded to the shame of despoiling the land and dispossessing

the indigenous peoples. What seems to have happened is that a laudably

corrective trend has predominated to such an extent that the emphasis seems

somehow reversed, and parents complain that they scarcely recognize the history

their children are taught.<p>



With a built-in emphasis on what had previously been ignored or suppressed, it

is hardly surprising that almost all the revisionist news, at least where

traditional American heroes are concerned, is bad. A question that was once

reasonably clear has become a muddle: How should we remember the leading

figures of our history? By their greatest achievements and most important

contributions or by their personal failures and peccadilloes? Can one category

cancel out the other? In a sense these reversals of fortune are inevitable,

inasmuch as nothing ever keeps its place in a world of incessant change. It is

perhaps an instance of what the historian  Henry Adams called the law of

acceleration -- the tendency of change to come faster and faster -- that 

John

F. Kennedy  and  Martin 

Luther King Jr.,whose murders elevated them to

martyrdom, should both come in for reappraisal while their memories and

legacies are still fresh. Do the revelations about such things as Kennedy's

womanizing, his not-so-heroic war record, and his non-authorship of a book for

which he accepted the Pulitzer Prize detract from his positive accomplishments

as President? Do the revelations about King's philandering and his plagiarism

as a graduate student have any bearing on his conspicuous achievements as a

civil-rights leader? Or is this a case of asking the question backward? Is it

perhaps more appropriate and revealing to ask, Are the significant

contributions of Kennedy and King, which affected the lives of millions of

Americans, in any way diminished by subsequent revelations about their

shortcomings and failings in other areas? <P>



In this climate the difficulties of

judging a figure like Thomas Jefferson by an appropriate standard are

considerably compounded. One who writes voluminously over a long time may

easily have his own words quoted against him or cited to prove that he held

views later modified or abandoned. Jefferson was preeminently such a person. On

this point Merrill D. Peterson has observed,<p>



<p>



<BLOCKQUOTE>His speculative and practical sides were frequently confused. Few men took into

account that Jefferson's private self, as expressed in his letters, might not

coincide with his public self. Or that his opinion at one time might not

represent his opinion under different circumstances. Or that a man of his

intellectual temperament did not often bother to qualify felicitous

generalizations.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>



	In some ways that are little recognized, Jefferson is surprisingly modern and

accessible to the present age. His pronounced notions about health, for

example, which seemed somewhat odd to previous generations, appear nowadays in

an entirely different light. He believed strongly that regular exercise was

essential to physical and mental well-being. As a college student, he developed

a regimen of daily running to keep himself fit, and he came to believe in later

life that walking was the most salutary form of exercise for the ordinary

person. On the subject of diet he also held strong views, which minimized meat

and animal products and emphasized instead the prime importance of vegetables.

For our own time, at least, Jefferson turns out to have been something of a

health-food prophet. <p>



Whether his leading ideas on politics and government will prove as resilient

remains to be seen. In spite of his great reputation as a statesman, many of

these have proved as counter to the prevailing currents of American history as

his prejudice against large cities and manufacturing. He could never reconcile

himself, for example, to the Supreme Court's deciding the constitutionality of

laws and acts of the executive -- a development he regarded as unwarranted and

disastrous. His preference for a small central government and his insistence on

the prerogatives of the states have been strongly rebuffed, if not virtually

obliterated, by decisive turns in our national development. Although history

cannot be reversed, the relative size and power of the central government is

once more (or still) at issue, as is the proper scope and authority of the

Supreme Court. Even Jefferson's views on the disadvantages of large cities have

today a resonance that was unheard or unheeded by previous generations.<p>



	Because he was attracted to laborsaving devices and was an ingenious adopter

and adapter of new gadgets, Jefferson has gained a reputation as an inventor,

but aside from a few items -- an innovative moldboard for a plough, a revolving

book stand -- he probably invented little. Though he used and enthusiastically

promoted the polygraph, a machine for making simultaneous copies of a written

document, he did not invent it, and could not even keep his own in repair. But

the fact that Jefferson is perceived as an inventor tells us something about

the way he is valued. Abraham Lincoln was much interested in inventions and

even went so far as to have one of his own patented, but this fact has made

little impression on his admirers and is entirely absent from the legend.<p>



	President Kennedy paid a famous tribute to the multiplicity of Jefferson's

talents, but they have always been regarded as astonishing. James Parton, one

of Jefferson's nineteenth-century biographers, gave his dazzling range of

abilities a dramatic accent when he characterized his subject as a man who

"could calculate an eclipse, survey an estate, tie an artery, plan an edifice,

try a cause, break a horse, dance a minuet, and play the violin." And Parton

was describing a young Jefferson who had not yet written the Declaration. When

the world's leading scientist and explorer, Alexander von Humboldt, came to

visit Jefferson in Washington in 1804, he came to see not the President of the

United States so much as the president of the  American Philosophical Society </a>

and the author of <I>Notes on the State of Virginia</I> (1785). Had he visited the

President at his home in Virginia, he would have seen what was perhaps the

finest private library in America, which later became the foundation of the

Library of Congress.<p>



	Not all of Jefferson's extraordinary talents are fully recognized by the

public at large. One that is not is his great achievement as an architect.

Self-taught from books and, until he went abroad, almost without worthy

architectural models to observe, Jefferson managed to design a number of

memorable structures. The residence of his that crowns (and names) a small

mountain in the Virginia Piedmont has become one of the most familiar objects

in American iconography. And Jefferson can claim credit for not just one

Monticello but two: the domed structure represented on the back of the nickel

is his second version of the house, which superseded the first one on the same

site, and is dramatically different.<p>



 	Part of the evidence for Jefferson's distinction as an architect is found in

his beautifully detailed drawings, some of which reveal fanciful structures

that were never built. But his most original and most imaginative design, and

the one recognized by professional architects as among the greatest of all

American architectural achievements, is his "academical village"--the campus of

the University of Virginia. </a> In forming his conception Jefferson effectively

reinvented the idea of the university, from the innovative curriculum to the

unique arrangement and design of the buildings. Here those seeking his monument

have only to look about them.<p>



	Although he was a many-sided and multi-talented man who left a lasting imprint

on a number of endeavors, there seems to be little doubt that Jefferson's

preeminent contribution to the world was the Declaration of Independence --

particularly its enduring affirmations of liberty and equality. In the prologue

of the Declaration these affirmations were made the axioms from which the

rights of revolution and self-government could confidently be deduced. The idea

of individual liberty was not, of course, original with Jefferson, or

exclusively an American invention. It was fostered in Western Europe by

philosophers, religious dissidents, and political rebels, but it took root tenaciously among transplanted Europeans in the New

World and, with the founding of the American republic, received its most

durable expression in the Declaration of Independence. To the Declaration's

studious and deeply learned author, many of what had passed in the history of

the world for the prerogatives of governmental power were arbitrary and

intolerable restraints on individual freedom. In fact, it is not too much to

say that Jefferson's reigning political passion was a hatred of tyranny. And

although his fear of the tyrannous abuse of power has sometimes been judged

excessive, it is hard to argue that tyranny has ever been, or is even now, in

short supply.<p>



	If it is possible to reduce so complex an issue to its simplest terms, one

might venture that for Jefferson the paramount political issue in the American

Revolution was what he called liberty and what we now call personal freedom, or

choice. It was and remains the virtual sine qua non of American culture,

something that Americans from the first have been strongly conscious of and

willing to fight for. But what has become the most familiar and the most quoted

phrase in the Declaration -- "all men are created equal" -- is about something

else. It is an intriguing fact that although Americans generally understand

that the prologue to the Declaration is their charter of freedom, even more

indelibly impressed upon their imagination is its affirmation of the ideal of

human equality.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>H</font>OW could the man who wrote that "All men are created 

equal" own slaves?  This, in essence, is the question most persistently 

asked of those who write about Thomas Jefferson, and by all indications it 

is the thing that contemporary Americans find most vexing about him.  In a 

recent series of some two dozen radio talk shows, I was asked this question 

on virtually every program, either by the host or by a caller.  Most often, 

those who point to this problem admire Jefferson, and they appear as 

reluctant to give up their admiration as they would be to give up the 

principle of equality itself.  But they are genuinely baffled by the 

seeming contradiction.<p>



The question carries a silent assumption that because he practiced slave

holding, Jefferson must have somehow believed in it, and must therefore have

been a hypocrite. My belief is that this way of asking the question, as in the

cases of Kennedy and King, is essentially backward, and reflects the pervasive presentism of our time. Consider, for

example, how different the question appears when inverted and framed in more

historical terms: How did a man who was born into a slave holding society,

whose family and admired friends owned slaves, who inherited a fortune that was

dependent on slaves and slave labor, decide at an early age that slavery was

morally wrong and forcefully declare that it ought to be abolished?<p>



	Though stating the same case, these are obviously different questions,

focusing on different things, but one is framed in a historical context and the

other ignores historical circumstances. The rephrased question reveals that

what is truly remarkable is that Jefferson went against his society and his own

self-interest to denounce slavery and urge its abolition. And, crucially, there

is no hidden assumption that he must in some way have believed in or tacitly

accepted the morality of slavery.<p>



	But when the question is explained in this way, another invariably follows: If

Jefferson came to believe that holding slaves was wrong, why did he continue to

hold them? This question, because of its underlying assumptions, is both harder

and easier than the first. It is harder because we are at such a great remove

from the conditions of eighteenth-century Virginia that no satisfactory

explanation can be given in a nutshell. To come to terms with the tangle of

legal restrictions and other obstacles faced by the eighteenth-century Virginia

slave holder who might have wished freedom for his slaves, together with the

extraordinary difficulties of finding them viable places of residence and means

of livelihood, requires a short course in early American history. But the

question is easier in that there is no doubt that these obstacles to

emancipation in Jefferson's Virginia were formidable, and the risk was

demonstrably great that emancipated slaves would enjoy little, if any, real

freedom and would, unless they could pass as white, be more likely to come to

grief in a hostile environment. In short, the master whose concern extended

beyond his own morality to the well-being of his slaves was caught on the horns

of a dilemma. Thus the question of why Jefferson didn't free his slaves only

serves to illustrate how presentism involves us in mistaken assumptions about

historical conditions -- in this case that an eighteenth-century slave holder

wanting to get out from under the moral stigma of slavery and improve the lot

of his slaves had only to set them free.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE inevitable question about slavery and equality partly reflects the fact

that most Americans are only vaguely familiar with the historical Jefferson,

but delving into his writings and attempting to come to terms with the

character of his thought, though illuminating, can create further

consternation. The college student confronting Jefferson's one published book,

<I>Notes on the State of Virginia</I>, is nowadays unprepared for and often appalled

at what the author of the Declaration of Independence had to say about race.

Thirty years ago college students were shocked to find Jefferson referring to

the slave population as "blacks," a term that to them suggested racial

insensitivity. But to those born after the civil-rights acts of the 1960s, it

comes as a shock to discover that Jefferson, while firmly in favor of general

emancipation, held out no hope for racial integration. Believing that an

amalgamation of the races was not desirable and would not work, he advocated a

plan of gradual emancipation and resettlement. Present-day students are even

more shocked to find Jefferson concluding, albeit as "a suspicion only," that

the blacks he had observed were "inferior to the whites in the endowments both

of body and mind." Even his positive finding that blacks appeared to be

superior to whites in musical ability rankles, for it comes through to students

of the current generation as an early version of a familiar stereotype.<p>



	At a time like the present, when relations between the races are in the

forefront of public discussion and desegregation is the law of the land, it is

not surprising that college students should be sensitive to discrepancies

between what they understand to be the prevailing ideals of their country and

the views of its most prominent Founding Father. National ideals, however,

spring not only from the beliefs and aspirations of founders but also, as this

essay attempts to show, from the experience and efforts of subsequent

generations. Though he foresaw that slavery could not prevail ("Nothing is more

certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free"),

Jefferson can hardly be counted bigoted or backward for seriously doubting that

a racially integrated society of white Europeans and black Africans was truly

feasible. As the Harvard historian Bernard Bailyn has written, "It took a vast

leap of the imagination in the eighteenth century to consider integrating into

the political community the existing slave population, whose very 'nature' was

the subject of puzzled inquiry and who had hitherto been politically

non-existent." Interestingly, the reasons that Jefferson gave for doubting the

possibility of integration -- "deep rooted prejudices entertained by the

whites; ten thousand recollections, by the blacks, of the injuries they have

sustained; new provocations; [and] the real distinctions which nature has made"

-- are the same reasons often cited by black separatists, who entertain the

same misgivings.<p>



	But if Jefferson's being a separatist can be accounted for, what can be said

about his invidious comparison of the natural endowments of blacks with those

of whites, or with those of American Indians, whom he found to be on a par with

whites? His own testimony suggests an answer, for he admitted that his

acquaintance with blacks did not extend to the African continent and embraced

only black people who had been born in and forced to live under the degrading

conditions of slavery. "It will be right to make great allowances for the

difference of condition, of education, of conversation, of the sphere in which

they move," Jefferson wrote, but it is evident in the hindsight of two hundred

years that his estimate of the capabilities of blacks failed to make sufficient

allowances, particularly for the things he himself named. It is perhaps poetic

justice that posterity should be liable to the same kind of mistake in judging

him.<p>



	But if Jefferson's beliefs add up to a kind of racism, we must specify two

important qualifications. First, that Jefferson offered his conclusions as a

hypothesis only, acknowledging that his own experience was not a sufficient

basis on which to judge an entire race. Had he lived long enough to meet the

ex-slave Frederick Douglass or hear the searing eloquence of his oratory, he

would have recognized intellectual gifts in a black man that were superior to

those of most whites. Douglass's oratory brings us to the second qualification,

which is a telling one. Attacking the justifications for slavery in 1854,

Douglass observed,<p>



<blockquote>



	Ignorance and depravity, and the inability to rise from degradation to

civilization and respectability, are the most usual allegations against the

oppressed. The evils most fostered by slavery and oppression are precisely

those which slave holders and oppressors would transfer from their system to

the inherent character of their victims. Thus the very crimes of slavery become

slavery's best defence. By making the enslaved a character fit only for

slavery, they excuse themselves for refusing to make the slave a freeman.<p>



</blockquote>



<p>



Although we may find Jefferson guilty of failing to make adequate allowance for

the conditions in which blacks were forced to live, Jefferson did not take the

next step of concluding that blacks were fit only for slavery. This

rationalization of slavery was indeed the common coin of slave holders and

other whites who condoned or tolerated the peculiar" institution, but it formed

no part of Jefferson's thinking. In fact, he took the opposite position: that

having imposed the depredations of slavery on blacks, white Americans should

not only emancipate them but also educate and train them to be self-sufficient,

provide them with necessary materials, and establish a colony in which they

could live as free and independent people.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>B</font>ut if going back to original sources and historical contexts is essential in

discerning the meanings that Today has imposed on Yesterday, it is equally

important in determining how Yesterday's meanings have colored Today's. The

concept of equality that is universally recognized in our own time as a

fundamental principle of American society only had its beginnings in the

eighteenth century; it did not emerge full-blown from the Declaration of

Independence.<p>



	Whenever he sent correspondents a copy of the Declaration, Jefferson

transcribed the text in such a way as to show what the Continental Congress had

added to his draft and what it had cut out. The process of congressional

emendation was clearly a painful memory for him, and the deletion about which

he probably felt the most regret was also the most radical of the passages, for

it undertook to blame the King of England directly for the African slave trade.

It begins,<p>



<p>

<blockquote>



	He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating it's most sacred

rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never

offended him, captivating &amp; carrying them into slavery in another

hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither....

Determined to keep open a market where MEN should be bought &amp; sold, he has

prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit

or to restrain this execrable commerce.<p>



</blockquote>

<p>



	Had this passage been ratified as part of the official Declaration, then a

question often raised in the nineteenth century -- Did Jefferson mean to

include blacks in the language of the Declaration? -- would have been

susceptible of a clear-cut and demonstrable answer. For, as the political

scientist Jean Yarbrough has recently pointed out, this passage says

unmistakably that the Africans captured into slavery were not a separate

category of beings but men, with the sacred rights of life and liberty that are

said in the prologue of the Declaration to be the natural endowments of all

men. It is precisely in having these same rights that the prologue asserts that

all men are created equal.<p>



	This deleted passage also provides an answer to a question often raised in the

twentieth century: Did Jefferson mean to include women in the phrase "all men

are created equal"? Implicit in the passage is that "men" is being used in the

broader sense of "mankind," for those who were cruelly transported to be

"bought &amp; sold" on the slave market were certainly female as well as

male.<p>



	That blacks and women were meant to be included in the affirmations of

Jefferson's Declaration at a time when they enjoyed nothing remotely like

political and social equality underscores a source of continuing confusion for

contemporary Americans -- the difference between a philosophical conception of

natural rights and a working system of laws and societal values which allows

for the fullest expression of those rights. In our own time the stubbornly

persistent disparity between these two is often a source of cynicism and

despair, but a Jeffersonian perspective would put more emphasis on the

considerable progress made in closing the gap. Jefferson himself was sustained

by a profound belief in progress. His unshakable conviction that the world was

steadily advancing, not only in the material but also in the moral sphere, is

abundantly evident in his writings. Though sometimes criticized as being naive

in this regard, he was fully aware that his belief embraced the prospect of

recurrent political and social transformations. Writing from retirement at the

age of seventy-three, he told a correspondent that "laws and institutions must

go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind."<p>



<blockquote>	As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made,

new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of

circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times. We

might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy,

as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous

ancestors.</blockquote><p>



	One way of looking at American history from Jefferson's day down to our own is

as the series of changes and adjustments in our laws and institutions

necessitated by the ideals implicit in Jefferson's Declaration. Sometimes the

effect of these ideals has been simply to prevent other, incompatible ideals

from gaining ascendancy, as in the case of Social Darwinism, whose notions of

the natural inferiority of certain racial and social groups were impeded by the

prevalence and familiarity of the Declaration's precepts. But without doubt the

most important event in the development of the American ideal of equality,

after Jefferson's Declaration, was Abraham Lincoln's address at Gettysburg.

Without any warrant from the founders themselves or from subsequent

interpreters or historians, Lincoln declared that not only the essential

meaning of the Civil War but also the national purpose itself was epitomized in

Jefferson's phrase "all men are created equal."<p>



	As Garry Wills has cogently argued, Lincoln at Gettysburg was practicing not

presentism but futurism. In the most stunning act of statesmanship in our

history, he invested Jefferson's eighteenth-century notion of equality with an

essentially new meaning and projected it onto the future of the nation.

Transfigured in the context of civil war, and transformed by Lincoln into a

larger and more consequential ideal, Jefferson's formulation would never be the

same. Thanks in large part to Lincoln, Americans no longer understand the

prologue of the Declaration as a philosophical expression of natural rights,

but rather take it to be a statement about the social and political conditions

that ought to prevail.<p>



	Jefferson's Declaration is thus remarkable not only for its durability -- its

ability to remain meaningful and relevant -- but also for its adaptability to

changing conditions. At a time when natural rights are widely proclaimed a

nullity, the language of the Declaration is universally understood as affirming

human rights, and is resorted to even by those who do not consciously associate

their ideas or aspirations with Jefferson. When the black separatist Malcolm X

underwent a change of heart about white people and publicly renounced the

"sweeping indictments of one race," he told an audience in Chicago, "I am not a

racist and do not subscribe to any of the tenets of racism. In all honesty and

sincerity it can be stated that I wish nothing but freedom, justice, and

equality; life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness -- for all people."

Simply to name the most basic American ideals is to invoke the words of

Jefferson.<p>



	"Today, makes Yesterday mean." In the light of the foregoing at least one more

meaning for Emily Dickinson's evocative phrase emerges: that the constantly

shifting conditions of the present serve to revivify the past, offering it up

as a subject for renewed exploration. Thus we can never hope to say the last

word about our history -- about Thomas Jefferson, for example -- because we are

continually having to re-open the past and consider its transactions anew in

the light of an unforeseen and unforeseeable present. <p>

	<font size=5>M</font>ost people--certainly most laymen--would be apt to think that the chief
business of the schools is to give pupils at least a modest working knowledge
of the subjects of the curriculum. Not a few students of education, it is true,
consider that this is a misconception, and that the true purpose of schools is
to bring about an adjustment to social demands for which the various subjects
are at best only means. Nobody, however, who surveys the conventional working
apparatus of courses of study, textbooks, recitations, examinations, and marks
can have much doubt that in practice the schools are making the mastery of the
curriculum an end in itself. Whether in theory they ought to or not, this in
fact is what they are manifestly trying to do.<p>

<p>

But they are not succeeding. About that there is no room for theorizing. Nor is
their failure sporadic, and confined to a few places where management is
unusually bad. It occurs almost universally, in the cities and in the country,
in large institutions and in small. The schools go through an elaborate,
costly, and exasperating set of motions called teaching natural science,
foreign languages, English, and so forth. Yet what is contained in textbooks
and syllabi obstinately refuses to transfer itself to the minds of the patrons
and stay there. In the grand struggle to get subject matter off the page and
into the head, the schools are suffering a spectacular and most disconcerting
defeat.<p>

<p>

This, I am aware, is a formidable statement. But it is made on formidable
evidence. The recent investigation carried on by the Carnegie Foundation in the
colleges of Pennsylvania, issued under the title *The Student and His
Knowledge*, which has caused considerable furor over the ignorance of college
seniors, is only a drop in the bucket. For proof of the defeat of the schools
does not depend on one investigation alone, or on a dozen, or a score, or a
hundred. We have here nothing less than the consistent testimony of thirty
years of enormously varied research in education.<p>

<p>

Since about 1910 many thousands of investigations have appeared, dealing with
almost every conceivable aspect of school work. Comparatively few of them
explicitly and directly consider the efficiency of the schools in terms of how
much subject matter they manage to induce the pupils to learn. Yet a great
many, without particularly setting out to do so, throw a most startling light
upon the results of education. Taken in the mass, they add up to a consistent,
coherent, and extremely impressive body of testimony, pointing towards one
conclusion: whatever the goods which our schools are delivering, they are not
what one might expect to find in packages labeled science, history, foreign
languages, English, and so forth.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>I.</font></b>

<p>

Suppose we call the roll of the principal subjects, asking in each case what a
person ought to learn if he is to have anything worth calling an elementary
working mastery of it, and also to what extent this is really being acquired.<p>

<p>

Let us start with mathematics. Here we have the most precise and powerful
instrument for abstract thinking and analysis devised by man. This, indeed, is
the very essence of the subject. Mathematics is a technique of thinking, and if
you have not learned to think in its special language you just have not learned
mathematics at all. Such thinking may not be very intricate or advanced; but,
all the way from simple arithmetic to differential equations and beyond, it is
the same kind of process. That process is quite different from doing sums,
because when one is set a sum one is told either directly or by the most
obvious sort of hint whether to add, subtract, multiply, divide, or what not,
and all one has to do is to follow certain rules and remember certain tables,
which clearly is routine rather than thinking. Essentially the job of every
mathematician, all the way from a first-grade child to an Einstein, is to take
hold of situations and disentangle them by the techniques of the science. A
beginner may not be able to deal with very complicated situations, or to carry
the disentangling very far. But he must go some appreciable distance along this
road--he must be able to decide what treatment the given situation requires,
whether addition or multiplication or something else--before he can claim
anything that can possibly be called mastery of mathematics.<p>

<p>

Now we know beyond peradventure that a very large percentage of children
studying mathematics in school go hardly a step in this direction. For
instance, the educational authorities in Iowa have carried through an ambitious
project known as the 'Every-Pupil Testing Program.' Part of that program was an
examination for mastery of the material taught in ninth-grade algebra. In
constructing this examination it was clear to the experienced workers that they
must use only very simple items, or almost every pupil would be defeated. (An
ominous consideration at the start. Inexperienced test-makers tend strongly to
expect far too much.) Sixty-two such items were assembled, samples being the
following 'Write a formula for the perimeter of the rectangle. Write a formula
for the area of the rectangle. A dealer sold a suit of clothes for $42, making
a profit of 20 per cent on the cost; how many dollars did he make?' Simple
enough, one would say; yet genuine problems, because they require not the mere
recalling of knowledge, but its application to the analysis of situations. Yet
it appeared that half of the large number of pupils taking the test, all of
whom had taken algebra, could do no more than ten of the items. Other results
showed that actual working knowledge of the ostensible content of the algebra
course was being acquired in only the most meagre degree.<p>

<p>

Again, another investigation was carried on in which a test in elementary
mathematics was given to a large number of children. When they were simply told
to perform certain operations, such as factorization, reduction of fractions,
the 'solution' of easy equations, and the like, 1000 out of 1200 succeeded. But
when problems were set up, which not only were simple, but involved no
operations other than those which these children had shown they could perform,
only about 300 succeeded. What shall it profit anyone to be able to do a
certain kind of sum on instruction but unable to use his skill in a problematic
situation? Can we say that such a person has any genuine mastery of
mathematics?<p>

<p>

Very similar results are reported for geometry. Pupils may be able to repeat
the proofs of theorems, or to recite definitions and postulates; but this is no
evidence that they can deal with 'originals'--that is, with problems for the
attack upon which theorems and definitions are only tools. Once more we ask in
what sense a person has 'mastered' a set of tools which he cannot use. If you
feel inclined to say that one cannot learn a proof without thought and
understanding, consider this: it has been shown again and again that even very
small accidental changes in the proof of a theorem will destroy the ability of
many pupils to repeat it. These children know how to prove that the square on
the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle ABC is equal to the sum of the
squares on the other two sides. Good! Now call the triangle PQR. A surprising
percentage of your group will be rendered helpless. Have they really learned
and understood the proof at all?<p>

<p>

Moreover, geometry does not stay learned. College freshmen, all of whom had
studied the subject within the past two years, were given a test designed for
high-school students: 86 per cent of these freshmen were below the high-school
norm; 50 per cent did worse than 75 per cent of the high-school students; and
26 per cent did worse than nine tenths of the high-school students. Also, they
were conspicuously weak in applying geometric reasoning to problematic
situations--that is, in the USE of the geometric equipment they had labored to
acquire. A subject which has been grasped and understood does not fade from the
mind so easily and fast.<p>

<p>

Other investigations have turned the spotlight on the intimate processes of
pupils who are tackling the job of dealing with simple mathematical problems.
Put pupils up against a situation requiring mathematical thinking, and what
happens? Do they carry through intelligent methods of attack, rational in
themselves even when slips in computation result in wrong answers? Do they
experiment and analyze and try out alternative procedures in some sort of
planned sequence? The author of one important study finds that few of them seem
to reason at all, and that reflective thought is not evoked. 'Instead, many of
them appear to perform almost random calculations upon the numbers given. Where
they do solve a problem correctly the response seems to be determined largely
by habit.'<p>

<p>

Still another body of disconcerting evidence is at hand. One would naturally
suppose that the longer a person studied a subject, the more mastery of it he
would gain. Yet, when tests of mathematical competence which do not simply
duplicate the situations and routines of textbook and course are applied, it
has often been found that there is little of such gain with time. Apparently
pupils are going through textbooks and courses but not effectively gaining in
mathematical insight and mastery. Everything comes together in an inescapable
conclusion. Mathematics is being energetically taught, but it is not being
learned to a degree that would, judged by common-sense standards, seem worth
while.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>II.</b></font>

<p>

In natural science the situation is much the same. Teachers of physics in
twenty-eight schools began to have misgivings about the efficiency of their
work and the amount of physics actually penetrating the minds of their pupils.
Obviously a person might be able to recite fairly well on assignments prepared
ad hoc the night before, or to do fairly well on examinations closely related
to the course, and still have no independent mastery of the subject as such. So
the teachers constructed a test which, on the basis of their pooled judgment,
represented what one ought to know when he had covered the two topics of
mechanics and heat. The results were illuminating, not to say startling. The
majority of pupils fell far below expectation. Such questions were asked as: 'A
stone is dropped and takes two seconds to hit the ground; from what height is
it dropped?' 'How much work is done to raise two pounds one yard?' These
particular problems had never been set, but everyone was supposed to have the
knowledge and technique needed to solve them. Inability to answer could only
mean lack of mastery of the subject as contemplated in the courses; yet this
appeared very generally. Also, it was found that a student's performance on the
independent test had very little relationship to his rating in the course in
physics. It was one thing to give correct answers under the special promptings
of assignment, textbook, and recitation, but quite another to show a mastery of
physics as such.<p>

<p>

A few years ago a comprehensive test to reveal competence in chemistry,
including in its scope, mechanical operations, the use of formulae and
equations, and general information, was given to groups of students in high
school, and to college students who had completed freshman chemistry. Let us
begin with the showing of the college students. Remember that all of them had
finished freshman chemistry; some had taken the subject in high school, and
others had not. But on the test there was no significant difference in the
performance of these two groups. Apparently the time spent studying the subject
in high school as a preliminary to taking it in college was an almost total
loss. University teachers might easily think this a severe reflection on
high-school chemistry. So indeed it is. But they should not boast too soon. For
those who had taken chemistry in high school and had not yet gone further
showed up just about as well on the test as those who had taken the subject
both in high school and as freshmen in college. Two years of the subject did
not give much better results than one, whether that one year was spent in high
school or in college.<p>

<p>

Moreover, with both physics and chemistry it has been shown that failure is
most conspicuous in the learning of those techniques and principles of analysis
which are the chief values of these subjects, and on which their practical
application principally depends. A smattering of unrelated facts, rather than
an insight into integrated, functioning laws, is what is acquired. And even
such facts are insecurely learned.<p>

<p>

Quite recently investigators have been raising a new question, more fundamental
than any I have discussed so far. Does the study of science, including
mathematics, teach scientific thinking? Just conceivably this might happen even
without the student's gaining any very extensive or exact information, or any
very firm grasp upon techniques and methods of analysis. Of course it is much
harder to tell whether a person is able to think scientifically than whether he
knows certain facts or is able to use certain techniques, so results here are
apt to be less reliable than elsewhere. Still, the attempt has been made rather
frequently, with great care and seriousness, and the answer to the question is:
No! There is practically no evidence at all that science, as taught in school,
makes one more careful about hypotheses, more willing to suspend judgment, more
openminded towards alternative views, more able to distinguish truth from
hokum. It does not, so far as we can tell, successfully promote these or any
other typical virtues of the scientific mind.<p>

<p>

<font size-4><b>III.</font></b><p>

<p>

Now let us turn to the so called language arts--foreign languages and English.
Regarding the former not much need be said; technical research simply confirms
a painfully obvious case. No one can be said to have a mastery of any language
unless he can read, write, or speak it, and not much of a mastery unless he can
compass all three. The language must serve him as an instrument of
communication in its own right, which means not only far more than being able
laboriously to translate it by main force of grammar and dictionary, but also
something essentially different. How many pupils achieve any such freedom with
French, German, or Spanish? Very few! Ask the same question about Latin, and
you must change 'Very few' to 'Virtually none.' It has been shown that, under
the conditions commonly found in our schools, a person must study Latin in high
school, through college, and for one graduate year before being able to read it
as freely as an average fifth-grade child reads English. Given really efficient
teaching, an average person can attain a good reading mastery of French,
German, or Spanish in two school years. (For Latin one might have to make it
three years.) The thing can be done, but it happens all too rarely. What is the
use of learning a language to a point below that of mastery?<p>

<p>

But what about English? Here too there is a record of failure and defeat. Do
pupils in school learn to read their mother tongue effectively? Yes and no. Up
to the fifth or sixth grade, reading, on the whole, is effectively taught and
well learned. To that level we find a steady and general improvement, but
beyond it the curves flatten out to a dead level. This is not because a person
arrives at his natural limit of efficiency in reading when he reaches the sixth
grade, for it has been shown again and again that with special tuition much
older children, and also adults, can make enormous improvement. Nor does it
mean that most sixth-graders read well enough for all practical purposes. A
great many pupils do poorly in high school because of sheer ineptitude in
getting meaning from the printed page. They can improve; they need to improve;
but they don't<p>

<p>

The average high-school graduate has done a good deal of reading, and if he
goes on to college he will do a good deal more; but he is likely to be a poor
and incompetent reader. (Note that this holds true of the average student, not
the person who is a subject for special remedial treatment.) He can follow a
simple piece of fiction and enjoy it. But put him up against a closely written
exposition, a carefully organized and economically stated argument, or a
passage requiring critical consideration, and he is at a loss. It has been
shown, for instance, that the average high school student is amazingly inept at
indicating the central thought of a passage, or the levels of emphasis and
subordination in an argument or exposition. To all intents and purposes he
remains a sixth-grade reader till well along in college.<p>

<p>

Moreover, the schools are not successful in promoting an interest in reading.
Survey after survey has come out with the same general results. Pupils in
school, and also high-school and college graduates, read but little. Medium
grade magazines and fair-to-medium fiction are the chief standbys. Reading
choices are made on hearsay, casual recommendation, and display advertising.
Education is clearly not producing a discriminating or venturesome reading
public. As one investigator concludes, there is no indication 'that the schools
are developing permanent interest in reading as a leisure-time activity.'<p>

<p>

The case is the same when we consider the art of writing the English language.
No great number of people are going to turn into subtle and imaginative
stylists, even with the best of teaching. But properly directed effort over a
period of years should certainly equip the average human being with what it
takes to express himself clearly, exactly, and correctly in his native tongue.
This happens, however, only on the most meagre scale. Investigators use a good
many different techniques to reveal the competence and maturity with which a
person can express himself in English. One of these is the ratio of the number
of dependent clauses used to the number of sentences used, which serves to
indicate the complexity of the linguistic pattern turned out. On this basis, to
be sure, there is a steady development throughout the school years. But other
criteria show that we have little cause for satisfaction. All through high
school and well into college we find the most amazing solecisms of grammar and
usage persisting. A great many high-school pupils are not able to discriminate
between what is a sentence and what is not.<p>

<p>

There is yet another highly significant criterion whose application yields some
very startling results. This is range of vocabulary. One does not, of course,
want people to use five-dollar words in profusion; but without adequate
vocabulary equipment it is not possible to express fine and precise shades of
meaning. Now word counts show that in the English of students, both in formal
compositions assigned in school and in letters, very few words occur outside
the thousand most commonly employed in the language. More significantly still,
as one goes from senior year in high school to senior year in college, the
vocabulary content of written English hardly seems to increase at all. After
twelve years in school a great many students still use English in many respects
childish and undeveloped; and four years more bring slight improvement.<p>

<p>

In the social studies and history the situation is much the same; I shall
mention the results of but one typical investigation. A test was constructed
calling for knowledge of a range of very simple facts in United States history.
It was given to pupils in the upper grades who had covered the field once. They
could answer only 15 per cent of the questions. High-school students, who had
spent an additional year on material largely identical, could manage 33 per
cent. College sophomores, after a third journey over the same pathway,
answered, on an average, 49 per cent. Less than half the simplest and most
obvious facts assimilated after three exposures! Surely a time-consuming,
inefficient process, to say the least.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>IV.</font></b><p>

<p>

Clearly, then, the campaign to induce and enable students effectively to master
the chief subject of the curriculum is not yielding any very striking
victories.<p>

<p>

What about the effect of the schools in building up in people's minds a stock
of general knowledge or information? This has been a tempting problem for
research workers, largely because a general knowledge test is comparatively
easy to construct; so we have plenty of material. The Carnegie Foundation
inquiry in Pennsylvania, to which I have already referred, dealt with this
question, and its results may be taken as representative, though they are
played up with unusual impressiveness. It showed that the gain in general
information between sophomore and senior year in college, and indeed between
high-school and college graduation, was meagre and uncertain. Many college
seniors had no wider range of general knowledge than sophomores, and some of
them were no better informed than high-school seniors. The report has stirred
up considerable comment, but to anyone familiar with the literature of
educational research it comes as no surprise.<p>

<p>

In this day of encyclopaedias, World Almanacs, and public libraries, a large
stock of miscellaneous information for ready reference does not seem
particularly vital. Even professional scholars can and do look up specific data
when and as needed. It is far more important to know where to look for facts,
and what to do with them when found, than to be able to produce them from under
one's hat at a moment's notice. So the very strong and consistent evidence that
twelve to sixteen years of schooling leave most people very inadequately
equipped with ready-to-use memory knowledge, though highly suggestive, seems of
secondary significance.<p>

<p>

The other body of experimental results, however, is quite a different affair.
These are the investigations dealing with what is known as transfer of
training. Probably all of us have at some time been told that a subject which
seems useless and futile for its own sake is still worth studying because it
helps with some other subject. Latin is said to help with other foreign
languages, and to improve one's English. Grammar is thought to enable one to
write and read better. Elementary mathematics is supposed to be an aid to
physics. Geometry trains one in reasoning. Such claims are quite familiar. What
one learns in one subject is said to transfer to others, and so to help in
mastering them.<p>

<p>

The hypothesis of transfer has been one of the chief topics of educational and
psychological research. Something like one hundred and seventy published
investigations have been devoted to it. Their general and accepted testimony is
that very limited transfer takes place. Students who have taken Latin show up
no better in other languages than those who have not; nor do they read better,
write better, spell better, or use larger vocabularies in their native
language. It has been shown again and again that work in English grammar has
almost no value as an aid to the accurate and competent use of the English
language. Persons who have spent a great deal of time studying grammar do no
better either in composition or in reading than others who have had little or
no grammatical training. Teachers of physics frequently complain that when
pupils enter their courses they seem to forget all the mathematics they ever
knew, and research backs up such grumblings. As to the argument that geometry
teaches people to reason better about things in general, it is preposterous,
and advanced without a shred of evidence.<p>

<p>

The cumulative results of this long list of investigations are authoritative
and accepted. They are summarized in almost every elementary textbook on
educational psychology, and are one of the commonplaces at teachers'
gatherings. Practically every professionally trained teacher in America has
heard the news that transfer of training does not take place, though without a
very critical or adequate insight into the evidence.<p>

<p>

When one studies a subject, any benefits there may be accrue within the subject
itself and not somewhere else. Such is the ascertained fact. (I state it
broadly, and without various, not unimportant, qualifications.) But the proper
inference from it, the moral of the tale,  is hardly ever pointed out. Transfer
of training ought to take place. Its failure to do is a reproach to teaching.
When pupils cannot use their mathematics in a physics course, something must be
wrong. Perhaps they never really learned their mathematics in the mathematics
course! Latin, with its close affiliation with other languages, ought to help
with French, Spanish, and German, not to mention English. When this fails to
happen, it is a reflection upon the teaching of Latin. Again, English style is,
in a sense, applied grammar. So when we prove that learning grammar does not
improve English expression--and this has been proved to the hilt--the inference
must be that grammar was pretty badly learned.<p>

<p>

Lack of transfer is not a law of nature or a fiat of the Almighty. It is an
indictment of teaching. Learn Latin as it should be learned, and it will help
you with other languages. Acquire a real grasp of mathematical thinking, and it
will not fail you when you tackle physics. The investigations on the transfer
of training simply go to swell the great volume of evidence that the schools,
in their attempt to generate adequate and worth-while masteries in the
subject-matter fields, are meeting with defeat.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>V.</font></b><p>

<p>

Why should all this be so? How does it happen that Johnnie Jones and Susie
Smith spend a good deal of time on various subjects with such disappointing
returns? What can we do about it?<p>

<p>

The trouble is that Johnnie and Susie set up a ligne Maginot of sheer mental
inertia, through which the attacking forces of education cannot break. For this
the fault is ours far more than theirs. It is their inevitable and instinctive
reaction to the whole apparatus of an education centring about the
traditionally determined curriculum. We are trying to sell Johnnie and Susie an
unsalable bill of goods.<p>

<p>

Let us see as simply and clearly as possible just what we are asking them to
do. We assume a standard body of content, including, by way of illustration,
the atomic law, the conditions leading up to the American Revolution, the
Tragedy of King Lear, and the skills required for solving a quadratic equation.
Obviously Johnnie and Susie cannot learn everything in the world, though in an
earlier and simpler day some very considerable thinkers did suppose that an
educated man was one who knew everything. To-day, however, the proposition is
manifestly impossible. Since life is short and school days fleeting, Johnnie
and Susie can assimilate only a very small fraction of human culture. So we
must make a selection.<p>

<p>

How do we make it? We make it on the basis of nothing more intelligent or
reassuring than long tradition. The material taught in the schools goes far
back through the years, some of it to a remote antiquity. Of course, like every
other tradition, it has altered somewhat with the passage of time, but slowly
and superficially. It has a sort of independent life of its own, which is
highly resistant to change. Textbooks and syllabi tend to be based on previous
textbooks and syllabi. Teachers tend to purvey what they themselves have
learned. The pattern of the basic curriculum is extraordinarily rigid, and has
never been critically reconstructed from the ground up, except in a few favored
institutions. In the main the schools continue to teach it for no better reason
than that it has always been taught.<p>

<p>

Now how much confidence can we have that a body of content so selected is
really worth learning? Surely very little! Can we say that it is a balanced and
representative sampling of the best and finest that the human spirit has
achieved and is achieving? By no means. In the standard curriculum there is
some fine gold, but also an unconscionable quantity of dross. If we wanted to
give our convenient inquiring friend, the Man from Mars, an idea of the best in
human culture, we would hardly hand him a set of school texts and syllabi. Why
should we do it with Johnnie and Susie? Or can we say that what we offer is
vitally related to the interests, concerns, and needs of young Americans? Again
the answer is: No! Nothing of the sort has been considered in making the
selection. Indeed, it is notorious that this material has been assembled in
advance, without any reference to the kind of people who are supposed to learn
it.<p>

<p>

But this is a fatal weakness. If we ourselves can have no great confidence in
the importance of the things we teach in the schools, how can we expect Johnnie
and Susie to believe in it? And if they have no authentic sense of the
importance and value of the things they learn, they cannot--literally they
cannot--learn them well. For the human mind is not naturally docile. It is
capable of amazing feats of resistance and rejection, beneath a tame and
dutiful exterior. It assimilates into its life and makes its own only those
things which, for some genuine reason, seem to matter. Everything else stays on
the surface and soon evaporates. This is no recondite scientific discovery, but
simple common sense. Everybody knows it from his own experience, though not
everybody drags it into consciousness as a guiding principle. Watch Johnnie and
Susie at work on some hobby. Then contrast them as they work at school tasks.
The difference? Obvious!<p>

<p>

Here, I insist, is where our trouble starts. We set up a body of material
which, in the nature of the case, must be mastered not because of its intrinsic
and manifest appeal, but under some kind of duress. Learning under no urge
except external duress, however, is contrary to all natural tendency.
Resistances are set up which frustrate the process, no matter how 'good' or
docile the learner seems. These are the forces which defeat the schools.<p>

<p>

Is there a way out? Of course there is. The first necessity is to abandon the
idee fixe of a standard body of content which everyone must learn. People young
and old learn what matters to them, what seems of genuine moment to them.
Whatever fails to come with the authentic impact of reality and need is
automatically and fatally rejected. In a very genuine sense each one of us
makes his own curriculum; for the only curriculum that matters is the one a
person carries in his head, rather than the one in the textbooks and syllabi.<p>

<p>

Hence the great necessity is for far more flexibility in our whole treatment of
children in the schools, and above all for flexibility in what we ask them to
master. Many reformist and experimental schemes have this as their controlling
principle, and they succeed in so far as they put it into effect. Teachers
should be free to bring to their pupils those portions and aspects of subject
matter which are of immediate and living concern. They should not be doomed to
keeping a rigid lock step, or to covering a predetermined area.<p>

<p>

This does not in the least mean that we shall stop teaching mathematics,
natural science, literature; and the like, and substitute current events, wood
carving, and cookery. It only means that not everybody will learn the same
mathematics, natural science, and literature, and that people will not always
learn them in the same internal order and sequence. We seem to have heard that
one man's meat is another man's poison. Why not apply this hackneyed wisdom
here? Any person's cultural meat--the culture which he is able to assimilate,
and which nourishes him--depends upon his present life interests, his status,
his needs, his concerns. And our schools must be so organized that it will
become possible to choose for a given individual or a given group at a given
time those elements of culture which will indeed provide nourishment.<p>

<p>

Will this prevent pupils from mastering the 'logic' of mathematics, or natural
science, or social science? They are not mastering it now! Strange to say, they
are not mastering it precisely because we present it to them as a logic.
Mathematics, for instance, is a technique or tool of thought. That is its
essence, its logic. But we do not learn to use this tool by first studying its
inner structure and organization up to a certain point, and then applying it.
We learn to use it by actually using it, in no matter how haphazard and
fumbling a fashion, upon problems which we really want to solve. So with all
the other disciplines. Let us handle our subject matter as something which is
alive, and its logic will take care of itself.<p>

<p>

To organize the schools in terms of flexibility rather than rigidity is no
small or easy task. It calls for much revision of conventional procedures and
instrumentalities. Yet it can be done, and in fact the work is going on apace.
For the benefit of those conservatives who may think that the way to get
children to learn more in school is a return to the good old days of high
pressure and rigid requirements, I project one more nugget of ascertained fact.
It has been shown that the experimental schools actually produce better
subject-matter learning than the conventional schools, with pupils of equal
ability. Carry such tendencies further, and we have good reason to expect still
more satisfactory results. What we contemplate is, to be sure, a breach with
some of our most adamantine traditions and customs. But we have before us the
problem of an intelligent rather than a stupid approach to the task which is of
such supreme importance in a democratic society--the task of bringing to the
individual his birthright of culture. It is a task in which we cannot afford
to, and need not, accept defeat.

<blockquote>

	<font size=5>W</font>HEN Oliver Wendell Holmes proposed that this magazine be called <i>The
Atlantic Monthly</i>, the conceit was that the magazine, like the ocean, would
carry trade between the Old World and the New. In a statement that appeared in
the first issue of the magazine, the publishers declared, "While native writers
will receive the most solid encouragement, and will be mainly relied upon to
fill the pages of <i>The Atlantic</i>, [the editors] will not hesitate to draw
from the foreign forces at their command." <p>

The foreign forces are exemplified in this issue by the worldly and
well-traveled historian-journalist Geoffrey Wheatcroft, who in 
<A HREF="../blair/blair.htm"> "The Paradoxical
Case of Tony Blair"</a> reports on the resurgence of Britain's Labour Party.
Wheatcroft, fifty, who has written for the magazine on subjects as diverse as
Margaret Thatcher and Salman Rushdie, the Republic of Ireland and the island of
Antigua, has been affiliated over the years with some of England's best-known
publications. In the late 1970s he was a columnist for <i>The Spectator</i>,
and also its literary editor. In the following years he was first the editor of
the "Londoner's Diary" in the <i>Evening Standard </i>and then that newspaper's
opera critic. He is currently a columnist for the <i>Daily Express</i>. In the
interstices of regular employment he has written many freelance articles and
published two books--<i>The Randlords </i> (1985), a study of South African
mining magnates, and <i>Absent Friends </i> (1989), a collection of biographical
sketches. A new book, <i>The Controversy of Zion </i>, about the history of
<a href="http://www.mcs.net/~astewart/zionism.html">Zionism </a>, will be 
published this fall by Addison-Wesley. <p>

Wheatcroft covered Tony Blair, the young, astute, sometimes-hard-to-pin-down
leader of Britain's Labour Party, when Blair first stood for office, in 1982.
How does covering British politics differ from covering American politics? "In
America government is more open. In England society is more
intimate--journalists and ministers are more likely to see each other
informally at lunch clubs or at parties. I remember Dwight Macdonald's saying
how astonished he was when he first lived in London that politicians and
newspapermen and union leaders and writers all went to the same parties. That
doesn't mean the politicians are any more likely to tell you the truth, of
course." For all that, the political resonances are audible. As Wheatcroft says,
"Blair has clearly got Clinton in mind the whole time--as an example and also
as a warning." <br>

	<font size=5>T</font>he news of Professor William James's death overwhelmed with deep sorrow the
large circle of his friends and colleagues in every land, and the still larger
circle of those who without knowing him had felt for him a sense of personal
affection. But the grief at the loss of this warm-hearted friend and charming
companion, this inspiring teacher and courageous advocate of justice, must soon
have allowed room for the thought of what a noble and useful life he had led,
and for gratitude that his frank, straightforward ways had made it possible to
think of him as still animating the varied scenes with which he was identified
so closely. He was so eager, so soldierly in spirit; his philosophy had so
little of what he used to call 'the Dead-Sea-apple flavor,' that it will be a
lasting pleasure to think how he would act if present; what humorous, generous,
illuminating, or indignant utterance he would bring forth.<p>

<p>

Those who knew him personally think of him most easily as he appeared in
private life, and indeed it was easy to forget--so simple were his tastes and
so unaffected his manner--that he was a great man and lived also in the eye of
the world.<p>

<p>

Surrounded at home by all that he really cared for,--family, friends, books,
everything except robust health,--he did not seek the fame that found him. Yet
he prized the honors that had come to him so abundantly, although mainly
because of the assurance which they brought him that he had done and was doing
the best work he was qualified to do. [See Endnote 1].<p>

<p>

I well remember the earnestness with which he said to me, two years ago, that
the results he had achieved were, in kind, just those he had aspired to
achieve; that he had asked no more than to succeed--by dint of personal weight
and by striking a note appropriate to his day and time--in accentuating certain
tendencies in the minds of thinking men which he believed to be wholesome and
of vital significance.<p>

<p>

James's ideals were generous. He cared less to see his private views prevail
than to see philosophy counting as a real influence in men's lives. He longed
to see the day when the advocates of a philosophic doctrine should recognize
that the best warrant for its value lay, not in their ability to defend its
claims against all comers, but in its power to inspire them with a desire for
ever-increasing knowledge, greater liberality, a more courageous life. His
attitude was at once an appeal against indifferentism, and for the recognition
of a common meeting-ground of all philosophic tendencies of thought. In this
sense pragmatism was a move toward mediation and conciliation, and this was one
of the main interests of his own life.<p>

<p>

James's foreign colleagues were quick to note this tendency and promise of the
new-world thinker's work. The distinguished historian, Guglielmo Ferrero, has
written eloquently, in a letter to the Figaro of September 22, of results
already won among the philosophers of the Continent by this refreshing breath:
'Neither in Europe nor in America will men soon forget the simple, modest
courage with which this student of philosophy proclaimed that men have need,
not alone of philosophic and scientific truths, but also of peace, happiness,
moral balance and serenity, and declared that no philosophic doctrine can be
considered adequate, however solid its logical foundations, unless it satisfies
the aspirations that lie deep within the mind.'<p>

<p>

Many of his papers and addresses, though not strictly popular in tone and
matter, were purposely kept free from needless technicalities, and so carried a
wide appeal. People of all sorts found that through one or another of his
writings, and equally through the impression of the writer, that went with
them, they got something which made their do their own work better and led them
to adopt a broader, more considerate, and a kindlier view of life.<p>

<p>

He, in his turn, was always eager to show sympathy and to notice signs of
merit. Biography, and especially autobiography, was his favorite reading, but
his search for noteworthy personal chronicle was by no means confined to the
lives of famous men. His Religious Experiences will testify that he was fond of
discovering and making known all outspoken lovers of the truth, especially if
obscure. He went about like a herald or torch-bearer, among those who seemed to
him deserving of recognition or in need of stimulation, as if calling to them,
'If you have anything to say on which you are willing to stake yourselves,
follow me and I will help you to get heard.' This habit sometimes brought him
into queer company and exposed him to many jests. He was not, however, greatly
disturbed by this, thinking more of the chance that he might find some grains
of intellectual or moral wheat which would otherwise have remained unfound.
With all the warmth of a very warm nature, he tried to bring it about that
every one whose needs he knew should be given the opportunity to set himself
free, to choose for himself, to develop on his own lines.<p>

<p>

This sense of the value of individuality in thought and act, which lay so deep
in his heart and was woven into the texture of his thoughts, was chosen by him
as the theme of his speech on the reception of his degree of LL.D. from Harvard
University in 1903. He spoke as one who, in spite of his long contact with the
university, had always looked on it somewhat from without. So he could clearly
see, he said, 'two Harvards.' One of these had certain special educational
functions, and served, also, in a very visible way, as a sort of social club.
The other was 'the inner, spiritual Harvard....The true Church was always the
invisible Church. The true Harvard is the invisible Harvard in the souls of her
more truth-seeking and intelligent and often very solitary sons. The university
most worthy of imitation is that one in which your lonely thinker can feel
himself least lonely, most positively furthered and most rightly fed.' In this
respect he believed that Harvard 'still is in the van.'<p>

<p>

James's love of personal liberty made him always ready to break a lance in its
defense, even when in so doing he incurred the displeasure of many a respected
friend and colleague. He came forward, unasked, as an advocate of those who
wished to keep the privilege of consulting Christian Scientists and other
irregular practitioners, when their standing was at issue before the
legislature; he was an ardent defender of the rights of the Philippine
Islanders, and a tireless supporter of all measures tending toward universal
peace. Since his death several of those who stood with him on these and kindred
issues have written warmly and gratefully of his aid. His belief that the
Anti-Imperialist League had a real task to perform in national affairs never
ceased, and he was one of its vice-presidents until his death.<p>

<p>

This is no place to discuss the merits of the public questions here alluded to.
I will say only that I have several letters written by him immediately after
his speech at the State House, urging that no legislative action should be
taken against the Christian Scientists and 'Mind Healers,' in which he declares
that it was solely a love of right and the public welfare that had prompted him
to come out against his medical colleagues. 'If you think I like this sort of
thing you are mistaken. It cost me more effort than anything I have over done
in my life. But if Zola and Colonel Picquart can face the whole French army,
cannot I face their disapproval? Far more easily than the reproach of my own
conscience '<p>

<p>

To know William James thoroughly one should have seen him in company with a
great variety of his friends in turn, so many notes did the gamut of his nature
hold. These various notes were by no means out of harmony with each other; it
was rather that he had many striking traits which no one person could bring out
with equal emphasis. It was an especially rare treat to see him in friendly
contest with one or several colleagues from whose views his own diverged. Such
encounters brought out his own attitude and theirs as if with a rapid series of
flash-light illuminations. He realized also that the fire of genius is
distributed widely among men, as radium is found in minute quantities among
baser minerals, and his generous instinct and intellectual zeal prompted him to
seek its traces out.<p>

<p>

Throughout his abundant social life he was so frank and so obviously friendly
that it was impossible to take offense at anything he said, and this made it
easier for him than for most men to strike the personal note in human
intercourse. He could get at once upon a footing which made a basis for
intimacy, if occasion called for this; a footing, which, in any case, left each
new acquaintance feeling the gates of his own mind unlocked for him. He said
jokingly, one day, that when he met a new person he asked him first his age and
then his income, and this was almost literally true. Furthermore, these
friendly relationships that he was so ready to establish did not always end
with social courtesies. Generous in deed as he was in word and thought, he gave
without stint, now, perhaps, a contribution of money to a friend in Reed, now a
book from his library, now time and friendly counsel, offered to show
appreciation and sympathy or to meet distress. This sense of kindliness was
thorough-going. He had made it a principle, so he told me, to abstain from
unfavorable personal criticism unless called for by some need. It was a rare
event to hear him pass an unfriendly judgment, and he disliked to hear it done
by others. He appreciated keenly the peculiarities of his acquaintances, and
could characterize them with accuracy and wit. But such comments were always
kindly or marked by a light and playful touch, devoid of sting.<p>

<p>

My first meeting with William James was in 1866, at the Harvard Medical School,
then on North Grove Street, and in thinking of him there I am reminded of the
old dissecting-room in the basement of that building, where the students
gathered every afternoon to recite and listen to the demonstrator of anatomy.
Perhaps I recall this with especial distinctness for the reason that James
congratulated me on having made a good recitation; but I was greatly impressed
at once with the frankness of his expression, the generosity of his manner, and
the peculiarly attractive quality of his voice. There must be few of his
friends who have not felt the same glow that I felt that day, at the sound of
his ever-ready and welcome words of praise. He was five years my senior, but
his education had been of an unusual sort and he had come late to medicine, so
that we were fellow students. I learned afterwards that he had spent much time
in Europe as a boy and youth, had then studied for one or two years at the
Lawrence Scientific School, and had finally decided to follow a strong instinct
and make himself an artist. In pursuance of this plan he had entered the studio
of Mr. William M. Hunt, then living at Newport. In Hunt's studio he made the
acquaintance of Mr. John Lafarge and they became close friends. But he soon
gave up painting and allowed his talent to lapse, though he always remained
capable of expressing himself freely in line-drawings.<p>

<p>

The next move was again toward natural science. He studied comparative anatomy
for a time with that delightful teacher, Professor Jeffries Wyman, and later he
made one of the company of naturalists and students who accompanied Professor
Louis Agassiz on his journey of exploration among the rivers of Brazil. Here
his skill in drawing came into good service.<p>

<p>

James's foreign training had given him a thorough mastery of French and a good
familiarity with German, and, better still, habits of mind and thought which
helped him to take a more cosmopolitan, and thus a more independent and
personal, view of American affairs. To hold and to express such views, on
matters political, social, and moral, was soon to become an opportunity for
great usefulness.<p>

<p>

During the medical-school period and also later, I saw James from time to time
at the house of his father, Mr. Henry James, on Quincy Street in Cambridge. His
father, his mother, and his sister were then living and at home, and one or
another of his brothers was usually there. My memory of this house, and of each
one of its occupants, is a memory warm and mellow with half-pictured scenes of
gayety, kindliness, and charm. William, the oldest of the five children, was
very like his father in feature, in manner, and in mind, and his father was an
excellent person to be like. Both of them had the instinct generously to
espouse unpopular causes, where the principle of personal liberty seemed at
stake, and in both the advocacy sometimes went to the verge of what many
persons called the fondness for a paradox. But this impression usually
disappeared upon more familiar acquaintance.<p>

<p>

In conversation both of these men had a delightful sense of humor, and a
remarkable richness of vocabulary. A peculiarity of both was the habit of
delaying speech for an instant, while the mind was working and the telling
sentence was framing itself for utterance--a brief interval during which the
lips would gather slightly, as for a sort of smile, and the eyes and face take
on an indescribable expression of great charm. Then would burst forth one of
those longer or shorter epigrammatic or aphoristic sayings which all their
friends recall so well, full of meaning, full of kindliness and humor, never
sarcastic, but always keen. Occasionally, too, they were full of fiery wrath.
This James humor has often been referred to as of Irish origin. If so, it
certainly throve well on American soil. It pointed also to the wide vision of
real culture and to experience with men and books, thus showing itself to be
cosmopolitan or universal, rather than racial. Certainly old and young, rich
and poor, foreigner and native, appreciated its great charm and penetration.
Sometimes a mere trifle would call out one of these rich, explosive
extravaganzas of speech. I remember listening one day with trepidation when Mr.
James, Senior, gathered his face into a half-humorous, half-thunderous
expression and then rolled out a series of denunciations on the people who
insisted on misusing the word 'quite.'<p>

<p>

As I remember James at home, during the period of which I have been speaking,
he was somewhat quieter and gentler in manner than he afterward appeared to be,
though always full of playfulness and fun. His laughter was never boisterous,
but no one could be quicker than he to see the chance for merriment, let the
joke be with him or against him.<p>

<p>

He had been much of an invalid, but he never lost for long his courage or his
buoyancy. He believed that one should industriously cultivate the bearing, the
expression, and the sentiments that go with health, and one of his former
pupils has recently told me of his making an appeal to his college class on
this subject. He succeeded, too, as a rule, in practicing what he preached, in
spite of a real tendency to occasional depression, which might easily have been
allowed to get control of him. I believe that through these frequent contests
with his health James materially modified his character and, indirectly, his
philosophic tendencies and views. This lack of vigor kept him at that time much
at home, and he had a small laboratory there where he did a good deal of
work.<p>

<p>

James's mother, quiet in temperament and manner, was a very real power in the
family, beloved by all, and holding all together; and this was also true of her
sister, Mrs. Walsh, who for a long time made her home with them.<p>

<p>

All the members of the James family were gifted with rich, melodious voices,
and William's had a resonance and charm which those who had once heard it,
especially in conversation, never could forget.<p>

<p>

James took his medical degree in 1869, but never practiced. He had already
become greatly interested in physiology and comparative anatomy, and was early
invited to teach these subjects to the undergraduates at Harvard. From
physiology he slipped into psychology, and so onward until finally he became
the chief figure in the department of philosophy, one of the best departments
of the college.<p>

<p>

From the time of our first meeting until a few months before his death I had
the privilege of seeing James fairly often, and of knowing something of his
intellectual interests and work. From 1876 onward he made almost yearly visits
to a charming spot in the Adirondacks, where there lies, in the midst of
mountains, brooks, and forests, a little group of rough houses forming a sort
of camp. James was formerly part owner of this very satisfactory establishment,
and appreciated to the fullest extent its simple but copious resources.<p>

<p>

These visits meant an opportunity of meeting a variety of acquaintances and
friends under the most informal of conditions, and usually meant also a fresh
deal of health. As a walker, he used to be among the foremost, in the earlier
years, and it was a pleasure to watch his lithe and graceful figure as he moved
rapidly up the steep trails or stretched himself on the slope of a rock, his
arms under his head, for resting. He had the peculiarity, in climbing, of
raising himself largely with the foot that was lowermost, instead of planting
the other and drawing himself up by it, as is so common. This is a slight
thing, but it was an element counting for elasticity and grace. There were
periods when he took the longest walks and climbs, but after a time he felt
that very vigorous exertion did not agree with him; and this belief, combined
with his love of talk with some congenial person on some congenial subject,
usually kept him back from the vanguard and rather at the rear of the long
line, where he could walk slowly if he liked and find the chance to pause from
time to time in order to enjoy and characterize in rich terms the splendid
beauty of the steep forest-clad slopes, with the sun streaming through the
thick foliage and into the islets between the tall trees.<p>

<p>

There were certain spots which he particularly liked to visit, and even to
visit alone or with a book--for he was always industrious and often did his
fifty pages of solid reading daily. One such place, a ledge forming the verge
of a superb precipice, with two fine pine trees overhead and the heavily wooded
valley of the Ausable River rising steeply toward the north and descending into
a broad plateau toward the south, was named for him many years ago by a warm
friend and admirer. Another beautiful spot, well up on a steep side of Round
Mountain, I remember reaching with him toward the end of a still and golden
September day. We had been walking for a number of hours through the thick,
dark woods, and this beautiful bit of cliff, nearly inclosed by the dense
spruces of the forest, and carpeted with moss of a rich yellowish-green tint,
afforded the first chance for the afternoon sun to stream in and for the
trampers to obtain a glimpse of the hazy valley winding off far beneath, and of
the sun-deserted mountains closing in the deep ravine, along one side of which
runs the narrow trail. I recalled this spot to his memory in a letter written
several years later (in 1899), when he was in Europe, seeking health at
Nauheim. He wrote back, saying, 'Your talk about Keene Valley makes me run over
with homesickness. Alas, that those blessed heights should henceforward
probably be beyond my reach altogether! It is a painful pang!'<p>

<p>

Fortunately, this prediction was not fulfilled. He improved greatly on his
return to America after this trip, came several times again to revisit old
haunts, and even did a fair amount of walking.<p>

<p>

He was very fond of stirring poetry, and one or another of our fellow campers
has spoken of verses by Kipling or Walt Whitman or Goethe as associated with
the thought at once of him and of some special mountain-top or forest walk.
Occasionally, also, in the afternoon, he would read us portions of his own
writings, at which he almost always was at work, and thus we had the first
chance at bits of several of his best papers.<p>

<p>

James was married in the spring of 1878 to Miss Alice H. Gibbens, and began at
once to improve in health and to lead a fuller and more active life. He soon
became widely known in Europe both through his writings and his fairly frequent
visits, and it was felt by all his colleagues there that the Harvard faculty
had rarely been represented by a brighter light than he.<p>

<p>

In the autumn of 1892 he established himself in Florence with his wife and
children for the winter, and thus amusingly describes their housekeeping:--<p>

<p>

'If we can escape freezing this winter the retrospect of next spring will
doubtless be a good one. Our apartment (just moved into) is snug, clean and
sunny, and though devoid of every "domestic convenience" except one stop-cock
and a hearth in a kitchen some ten feet by six, seems a place in which
housekeeping can go on. Our cook, Raphaello, with whom we converse by means of
raw Latin roots without terminations, seems nevertheless to grasp our meaning
and evolves very savory dinners out of the nudity of his workshop. A one-sou
fan is his principal instrument--by it he keeps the little fires from going
out. I ought to say that we have a big Bernese governess, who looks like Luther
in his more corpulent days, and, knowing more Italian than we do, has been
quite useful as interpretess. But her appetites are ungovernable, she has no
tact, and we shall have little use for her when the boys get to school, so we
shall soon say farewell and give her a recommendation to some very full-blooded
family.<p>

<p>

'I'm telling you nothing of our summer, most all of which was passed in
Switzerland. Germany is good, but Switzerland is better. HOW GOOD Switzerland
is, is something that can't be described in words. The healthiness of it passes
all utterance. The air, the roads, the mountains, the customs, the
institutions, the people. Not a breath of art, poetry, aesthetics, morbidness,
or "suggestiveness." It's all there, solid meat and drink for the sick body and
soul, ready to be turned to and do you good when the nervous and gas-lit side
of life has had too much play. What a see-saw life is, between the elemental
things and the others. We must have both; but, aspiration for aspiration, I
think [that] of the over-cultured and exquisite person for the insipidity of
health is the more pathetic. After the suggestiveness, decay, and
over-refinement of Florence this winter, I shall be hungry enough for the
eternal elements to be had in the Schweiz.'<p>

<p>

From the very beginning of their married life in Cambridge, Mr. and Mrs. James
showed a hospitality which made them a marvel to their friends. In season and
out, all were made welcome. This was especially true of visitors from Europe,
whether those at whose hands James had received hospitality in his turn when
abroad--for he was everywhere a welcome guest--or those who came to Cambridge
attracted by his writings and reputation. All such visitors were made at home,
for shorter or for longer periods, and only the friends of their hosts realized
how much trouble was taken to make their stay successful.<p>

<p>

What his home was to others, to him it was more, a thousand-fold. Every one who
watched him saw clearly that he owed a distinct portion of his steady growth in
tranquillity and power of accomplishment to the home influences--intellectual,
physical, and moral--that formed the main background of his life. If the vital
force was native and resident in him, its development was fostered by the
untiring devotion which was constantly at his command. And this he himself
knew. Seconded by his wife, he made friends in every land, some of them through
personal intercourse, which he always sought, and some through correspondence
only. He was as sociable as Montaigne, both from principle and from true love
of his fellow men.<p>

<p>

One of the many foreign friendships which he greatly valued and frequently
referred to was that with M. Renouvier, the able editor of the Critique
Philosophique. There was a strong personal and intellectual sympathy between
these two men. James was also an occasional contributor to the Critique. He
wrote French with fluency and grace, and infused into it some of the elements
that made his English style so engrossingly effective.<p>

<p>

He had thought much, also, cosmopolitan as he was, about the relative
advantages of the life in Europe and in America, and was always ready to talk
about this subject. With his sensitiveness and his fine taste, he loved the
cultivated, aesthetic atmosphere of France and England, and there were times
when he longed for it and felt that he must gratify the longing. But he was at
heart an American, and even a way-breaker, as well as an artist. One of his
friends remembers his quoting from Gray's 'Eton,' the lines ending, 'And snatch
a fearful joy,' with reference to the satisfaction and at the same time the
sacrifices which American conditions offer and require. His attitude on this
question illustrates his attitude on many questions. He could feel a warm glow
in favor of two opposing sets of interests, each in turn, and yet one could
predict which, in the end, would prove the stronger. I recall hearing him speak
one day, in the dining-room of our Adirondack camp, of certain 'bitter-sweet'
articles of food, of which it was 'hard to say whether one likes or dislikes
them most.' But there are many bitter-sweets in life, and he was alive to the
value of both elements that they contained. His readers will recall a charming
essay [See Endnote 2] in which he describes a journey in the mountains of North
Carolina and tells of passing by a large number of unkempt, squalid clearings,
littered with the stumps and boughs of fresh-cut trees, and savoring of
destruction, devastation, and discomfort. As he was in the act of drawing this
lesson, he said to the mountaineer who was driving him,--<p>

<p>

'What sort of people are they who have to make these new clearings?'<p>

<p>

'All of us,' the man replied. 'Why, we ain't happy here unless we are getting
one of these coves under cultivation.'<p>

<p>

James 'instantly felt' that he 'had been losing the whole significance of the
situation.' 'The clearing which to me was a mere ugly picture on the retina,
was to them a symbol redolent with moral memories and sang a very paean of
duty, struggle, and success.'<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

Few persons have written more charmingly or more lucidly than Professor James,
or with greater evidence of personal conviction. This last feature of his books
and papers was indeed so marked, what he said came so obviously from his heart,
that to speak of his 'style' seems inappropriate. He was through and through an
artist, in writing as in speech, and yet he used his art so obviously as a way
of making his meaning clear that the reader thinks of his charming and telling
manner mainly in terms of the conclusions that it enforced. When one reads his
books it is a pleasure to assume one's self in full accord with him, even in
the face of disagreement, so delightfully does he call learning, humor, fancy,
abundant, and apt citation, the homeliest of illustrations and the most daring
of analogies, to the aid of his incisive argument. In all this he shows himself
not only expert in knowledge and in literary skill, but a broad reader and an
intimate knower of human thoughts and passions in wide range. He was of course
a delightful correspondent, and he wrote copiously and to many persons. Even
when very ill or very busy he managed to keep in touch in this way with a large
number of his friends, though he was sometimes forced to call in the ready
service of his wife as amanuensis.<p>

<p>

He began to make scientific communications within a few years after his
entrance on academic work. The earlier papers dealt with physiological
questions. Even in these his psychological and philosophical interests were
foreshadowed, while, on the other hand, his early training as a physiologist
affected all his later work. One of the early papers, on 'The Law of Forward
Action in the Nervous Systems' in which he showed that the impulses in nerve
fibres run always in one or the other direction, according to the function of
the nerves concerned, is cited as important by the eminent English
physiologist, Sherringten. His well-known papers on the absence of dizziness in
deaf-mutes, on 'The Sense of Effort,' and on the 'Perception of Space,' are
partly of physiological and partly of psychological interest.<p>

<p>

It would be out of the question to review here his contributions in the
psychologic field, but attention may be called in passing to his insistence on
the very important part played by sensation in the feeling of emotion and even
of consciousness itself. This doctrine, which was brought out at about the same
time by the Swedish psychologist Lange, promptly became famous, the world over.
It has a decided interest here as being closely related to some of his later
philosophical generalizations. Sensations of various subtle kinds, as those
coming from the circulatory and digestive apparatus, well known to be excited
in the strong emotions, were recognized by him as deserving of more attention
than they had received; and when he came to analyze the feeling of emotion
closely it seemed to him that the honest observer could not assert that
anything else was there. Strip off 'sensation' from emotion and what is left?
he asked. At a later day the sense of consciousness was analyzed in the same
fashion.<p>

<p>

I cannot discuss the merits of these difficult subjects here, but I desire to
point out that just as he felt that he must fully reckon with the influence of
SENSATION, the most tangible element in EMOTION, before he would allow that
anything else was there, so he felt that the influence of EXPERIENCE should be
fully reckoned with before other means of judging of the TRUTH were turned
to.<p>

<p>

This seems to me a distinct illustration of the way in which his mind worked.
Although thoroughly alive to the existence of influences in the world which can
only be reached through a free use of a trained imagination, his love of
simplicity and directness led him to estimate at their full value the factors
that had the merit of being relatively commonplace, and therefore more familiar
to the ordinary mind and to exert all his powers of observation to note more of
these than others had discovered.<p>

<p>

The earliest of his philosophical papers, so far as I am aware, was one written
for the Critique Philosophique; and the next, on much the same subject, was
that which was published later as the first part of The Sentiment of
Rationality. This was first given as an address in 1879, and was finally
brought out, in 1897, together with other valuable papers, in a volume called
The Will to Believe, and Other Essays in Popular Philosophy.<p>

<p>

His first enterprise in actual bookmaking was in 1885, when he edited The
Literary Remains of Henry James, the preface to which was partly his own work,
partly made up from extracts from his father's writings. All those who wish to
gain insight into the evolution of Professor James's mind by noting the
influences which were early at work on him, should read this admirable volume.
The theology there defended is sufficiently simple and sufficiently well
adapted for men's needs to have commanded James's respect and both the
character of the sentiments and the splendid language of the father strongly
remind one of the son's thought and style.<p>

<p>

His next book was the important two-volume Psychology, published in 1890 and
written for the most part during a trip to Europe. This book proved an immense
success. It has continued to win popularity and fame and has been translated
into a number of languages, the latest being the Italian. Professor James told
me only recently that this success had surprised him greatly. He had not taken
especial pains, he said, to make a monumental work. But his mind and thoughts
were so untrammeled, so keen and fresh,<p>

that he could not help writing a good book. He was one of the few scientific
writers whose productions became a source of revenue. He made sundry trips to
Europe, largely on the income derived from the Psychology, the Talks to
Teachers, and the Religious Experiences, and the sale of his last two books
also has been large.<p>

<p>

In 1898 he delivered the Ingersoll lecture on Personal Immortality.<p>

<p>

In 1899 he gave and published his now famous Talks to Teachers on Psychology;
and to Students on Some of Life's Ideals, a book of great charm, great wisdom,
and true scientific penetration.<p>

<p>

In 1901 and 1902 he delivered at Edinburgh his first English lecture course,
the Gifford Lectures, which at once appeared in book form as the Varieties of
Religious Experiences; a Study in Human Nature. It was understood that he had
long been collecting the materials for this book, for his object was not so
much to give his own religious convictions as to show under how many and how
varied aspects, convictions that could be called religious had impressed
themselves on a variety of men and had helped to mould their lives. In the
closing chapter he makes statements which indicate how he felt at that time on
certain subjects which were being studied by his English colleagues of the
Society for Psychical Research. He always took intense and appreciative
interest in the investigations of both the English and the American branches of
this society, though he did not bear so active a part in them as many people
have supposed. The more prominent workers, both in England and America, were
his personal friends, especially Richard Hodgson, the devoted secretary of the
American branch. For a number of years James served as president of this
branch. <p>

<p>

Finally, in 1907 and 1909, respectively, came out the two books on Pragmatism
and on Pluralism, and a third, The Meaning of Truth (1909), which formed an
explanatory supplement to the course on pragmatism. He also wrote a large
number of scientific papers and minor addresses, such as the fine tribute to
Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, and several delightful biographical sketches, as
those on Professor Louis Agassiz and on Thomas Davidson.<p>

<p>

Professor James's attitude toward the general problems of philosophy is well
known. He called himself a 'radical empiricist,' a 'pragmatist,' a 'pluralist,'
and it is fair to say that these terms, indicative of his beliefs, indicate
also important features of his own character. It is evident that he approached
the deeper problems of life as a lover of men and a sympathizer with human
needs, but also with the conscientiousness of a person trained to careful
observation, and yet fully realizing that in the desire to make observation
'careful' it is very easy to make it narrow. He insisted on making 'experience'
the touchstone for determining the value or the truth of a belief. But
experience was construed by him in a far wider sense than by many others, and
he was always ready to extend its scope. If a man could truly say that his life
was made richer in any important respect by the acceptance of a given doctrine,
vision, or intuition, then, in so far, the doctrine should count as true for
him. He felt strongly that each person should strive to satisfy the demands,
not only of his reason, but also of his aspirations and his sense of the power
to accomplish something new and real, which every man possesses in some
measure. Just because he felt the deep practical significance of the task which
philosophy assumes, in trying to explain the rationality of a world filled with
suffering and sorrow, he shrank from encouraging the acceptance of
interpretations which might sound well but which a deeper searching of one's
observation did not verify as helping to a true and a sounder life. He objected
strongly to the method of education which enabled the scholar glibly to 'throw
the rule at the teacher' but left him unable to do the sum to which the rule
applied.<p>

<p>

<p>

It is safe to say, of course, that but few of the colleagues with whom he
joined issues over philosophic problems would consent to be classed as opposing
these propositions stated in this broad way. Every one acknowledges the claims
of observation, thoroughness, and honesty, and so every one is a pragmatist and
an empiricist. But James believed in drawing trenchant distinctions as an aid
to clearer thought and more fruitful discussion, and conscientiously believed
that the existence of a distinct difference of emphasis between his views and
those of certain of his colleagues pointed to the practical need of a
distinctive name. He longed to go to the furthest possible limit in his
estimate of spiritual freedom and the possibility of a real unity and harmony
underlying the distracting signs of multiplicity and discord in the world, but
he felt that he should best help this cause, which he had so much at heart, by
indicating distinctly the features by which each man might hope to recognize
the sought-for angel of his truth, when met, and by making it perfectly clear
what degree of success he himself had had. He came, eventually, to direct his
search, not for THE truth but for TRUTHS. For the attempt to assert the truth
makes it necessary to depart from the pathway of experience--so he thought--and
to trust one's self to forms of reasoning which, after years of study, he had
found himself unable to accept as binding. His description, in The Pluralistic
Universe, of this contest in his mind is full of the deepest interest.<p>

<p>

In this crusade against an intellectualism which he considered ultra, James
found a powerful ally in the admittedly great French philosopher and
psychologist, Bergson, who with keen arguments asserts that the ultimate facts
of life are only to be appreciated by immersing ourselves in life's stream and
feeling it. Life implies motion, and motion we can create but cannot picture or
describe. What we can do is to use the intellect for approaching nearer and
nearer to the point from which, with the aid of intuition, we may get the sense
of dipping into the fountain of reality.<p>

<p>

Closely related to James's confidence in experience was his belief in the
creative power of a voluntary act. He recognized that the practical issues with
which philosophy indirectly concerns itself are so momentous for the everyday
life of men, that it is unwise to wait too long before committing one's self to
the view which seems the best. He therefore urged that every one, after looking
at the facts as fairly as he could, should choose and act, even at the risk of
choosing and acting from reasons that he might afterwards judge to have been
mistaken. In thus acting, men might be, he thought, not only discovering the
truth, but helping to create it.<p>

<p>

It might be supposed, by one who did not know Professor James, that with his
fixed confidence in experience as the proper touchstone of the truth, he would
have been led straightway into the materialistic camp, or, at least, into the
camp of those who though idealists are practically determinists. But not only
was it untrue of Professor James that he took that road, but a fair reading of
his arguments makes one agree with him that he was at liberty, logically, to
refuse to take it. Every book, every essay, of his is redolent with the
doctrine that if a man takes his whole self into account, realizing that he is
not only a reasoning being but a feeling and aspiring being, and that his very
reasoning is colored by emotion, then choices, preferences, leaps-in-the dark,
the 'presentiment of the eternal in the temporal,' become justifiable in so far
as they are real. This was one of the pragmatic outcomes of his RADICAL
empiricism.<p>

<p>

While his course of lectures upon pragmatism was in progress I wrote to him,
saying that although the practical value of his recommendations to rigid
honesty in applying the test of experience seemed undeniably of value, yet I
thought the TENDENCY of his doctrine might be to encourage, among some persons,
a too narrow conservatism of a materialistic stamp. He wrote back, saying for
himself at least,--'Surely you know there is an essence in me (whatever I may
at any moment appear to say) which is incompatible with my really being a
physico-chemico-positivist.'<p>

<p>

This quality in Professor James's mind which enabled him to maintain his stout
adherence to scientific accuracy and to assert the necessity for taking
experience as the court of last resort, yet at the same time to recognize the
existence of influences that transcend the evidence of the senses, kept him in
touch at once with science and with religion, and made it possible for him to
believe in a real spiritual freedom. <p>

<p>

Instinctively devout and possessing religious sentiments, and sympathizing
doubtless with his still more strongly religious father, he found no
difficulty, in spite of his critical attitude with regard to the doctrine of an
all-absorbing 'Absolute,' in reconciling his conception of an imperfect,
perhaps essentially disjointed and pluralistic universe, helped along by the
combined efforts of the spiritual powers resident in men, with a belief in the
possible and probable existence of a greater spiritual personality, between
whom and ourselves and all the phenomena of the world a perfect intimacy must
exist. We cannot prove this, he declares, but there is no argument or evidence
which can prevent us from assuming it if we will, and if our assumption is
sound our acts help to make the truth efficient for our needs.<p>

<p>

It is idle to say, he would insist, that this procedure is unscientific; that
the truly scientific man does not assume but always proves the truth. For not
only does every progressive scientific man necessarily use his imagination in
forecasting his results, but the attitude of holding back from a decision for
the chance of a greater certainty is in itself an emotional, and not alone a
rational, attitude. There are times when you must 'believe what is in the line
of your needs, for only by such belief is the need fulfilled....You make one or
the other of two universes true by your trust or mistrust--both universes
having been only maybes, in this particular, before you contributed your act.'
Applying this principle to the question of religious belief, he says, [This]
'command that we shall put a stopper on our heart, instincts and courage, and
wait--acting of course meanwhile more or less as if religion were not
true--till doomsday, or till such time as our intellect and senses working
together may have raked in evidence enough--this command, I say, seems to me
the queerest idol ever manufactured in the philosophic cave.' Again, 'Better
face the enemy than the eternal Void.'<p>

<p>

In the same essay from which the last sentence is quoted, James points out that
the chief and primary function of the intellect is to bring practical results
to pass; to answer the question, 'What is to be done?' and says, 'It was a deep
instinct in Schopenhauer which led him to reinforce his pessimistic
argumentation by a running volley of invective against the practical man and
his requirements. No hope for pessimism unless he is slain.' In the whole set
of inspiring essays which The Will To Believe leads off as with a trumpet's
note, this thesis, that the will, if strong enough to lead to action, is a real
factor in the world's progress, is maintained with strong emphasis; and in the
lectures on the Pluralistic Universe the same theme is taken up again and
reinforced.<p>

<p>

Even in his psychology he foreshadowed a certain portion of this philosophic
attitude by asserting it as at least possible, and scientifically quite as
admissible as the opposite assumption, that in the act of attention the will
adds something new to the forces therefore present in the world. This was a
great step for an academic psychologist to take.<p>

<p>

Though frankly iconoclastic and outspoken, and a hard-hitter in an intellectual
combat, Professor James made no enemies, but usually drew closer and closer, as
time went on, the ties of early friendships. Soon after his complete
retirement, his colleagues of the department of philosophy at Harvard asked him
to let them have his portrait painted, to be hung upon the walls of the Faculty
Room in University Hall. When the portrait was finished, Professor James
entertained the whole division of philosophy at his house. The occasion was a
memorable one, and especially so for the reason that Professor Royce, who had
always been one of James's most loyal friends and admirers, made an exceedingly
warm-hearted and eloquent address. I quote here a few of his sentences, though
the choice is difficult where everything was so good:--<p>

<p>

'Nothing is more characteristic of Professor James's work as a teacher and as a
thinker than is his chivalrous fondness for fair play in the warfare and in the
cooperation of ideas and of ideals. We all of us profess to love truth. But one
of James's especial offices in the service of truth has been the love and
protection and encouragement of the truth-seekers. He has done much more than
this for the cause of truth; but this at least he has always done.<p>

<p>

'He has lately warned us much against thinking of truth as a mere abstraction.
And indeed it has always been his especial gift to see truth
incarnate,--embodied in the truth-seekers,--and to show his own love of truth
by listening with appreciation, and by helping the cause of fair play, whenever
he found somebody earnestly toiling or suffering or hoping in the pursuit of
any genuine ideal of truth....Other men talk of liberty of thought; but few men
have done more to secure liberty of thought for men who were in need of fair
play and of a reasonable hearing than James has done.'<p>

<p>

James was one of the first among professional psychologists to recognize the
full bearing of the contributions which medical observation--that is, the
psychology of the unusual or the slightly twisted mind--has made to the more
classical psychological attitudes and insights. In the early portion of his
short but stirring address, The Energies of Men, he says, 'Meanwhile the
clinical conceptions, though they may be vaguer than the analytic ones, are
certainly more adequate, give the concreter picture of the way the whole mind
works, and are of far more urgent practical importance. So the "physician's
attitude," the "functional psychology," is assuredly the thing most worthy of
general study today.'<p>

<p>

The truth of these propositions has been amply verified, and the fact that he
made them is but one more illustration of his power to see and seize upon the
significant elements of a situation, as a skillful commander recognizes the
points of strength and weakness of his adversary's lines.<p>

<p>

<p>

William James was a manly and a radiant being. Loving and loved, he made all
men think, and helped many a doubting soul to feel a man's glow of hope and
courage, each for his own work This was a noble task.<p><br>

	<font size=5>H</font>amlet is derived from a story in Francois de Belleforest's Histoires Tragiques

(1576), not yet translated into English when Shakespeare adapted it.

Shakespeare introduced new characters and greatly enlarged the roles assigned

to various characters by Belleforest. One of these magnified characters is

Polonius, the Lord Chamberlain to the King of Denmark, who is not even named in

the original story. As long ago as 1869 the scholar George Russell French noted

the similarities between Queen Elizabeth's principal minister, Lord Burghley,

and Polonius in Hamlet French added that Burghley's son and daughter Robert and

Anne Cecil seemed to correspond to Laertes and Ophelia.<p>



<p>



Taking this scenario one step further, Hamlet himself becomes Edward de Vere,

the seventeenth Earl of Oxford. Ophelia was unhappily involved with Hamlet; De

Vere, who grew up as a royal ward in the household of Lord Burghley, was

unhappily married to Anne Cecil. Oxford believed that his wife had been

unfaithful to him while he was away on a European tour and (for a time, at

least) seems to have doubted that he was the father of her first child. Hamlet

says to Polonius, "Conception is a blessing, but not as your daughter may

conceive."<p>



<p>



Hamlet has often been thought to be autobiographical. Was Edward de Vere, then,

Shakespeare? Confining ourselves just to Hamlet, we find more than a few

additional parallels:<p>



<p><ul>



<li> Lord Burghley wrote out a set of precepts ("Towards thy superiors be humble

yet generous; with thine equals familiar yet respective") strongly reminiscent

of the advice Polonius gives to Laertes ("Be thou familiar but by no means

vulgar...."). Burghley's precepts, intended for the use of his son Robert, were

published in 1618. Hamlet first appeared in quarto in 1603. Edmund K. Chambers,

one of the leading Shakespeare scholars of the twentieth century, offered the

following explanation: "Conceivably Shakespeare knew a pocket manuscript."<p>



<p>



<li> In Act II Polonius sends Reynaldo to spy on Laertes in Paris, possibly

catching him "drinking, fencing, swearing, quarreling," or "falling out at

tennis." In real life Burghley's older son, Thomas Cecil, did go to Paris,

whence the well-informed Burghley somehow received information, through a

secret channel, of Thomas's "inordinate love of...dice and cards." Oxford,

incidentally, did have a real "falling out at tennis"--not a widely practiced

sport in those days--with Sir Philip Sidney, the Earl of Leicester's nephew.<p>



<p>



<li> Oxford and Hamlet are similar figures, courtiers and Renaissance men of

varied accomplishments; both were scholars, athletes, and poets. Many critics

have noted Hamlet's resemblance to Castiglione's beau ideal in The Courtier. At

the age of twenty-one, Oxford wrote a Latin introduction to a translation of

this book. Both Oxford and Hamlet were patrons of play-acting companies.<p>



<p>



<li> In 1573 Oxford contributed a preface to an English translation of Cardanas

Comfort, a book of consoling advice which the orthodox scholar Hardin Craig

called Hamlet's book." The book includes passages from which Hamlet's soliloquy

was surely taken ("What should we account of death to be resembled to anything

better than sleep....We are assured not only to sleep, but also to die....").<p>



<p>



<li> Oxford stabbed a servant of Burghley's (possibly another of Burghley's

spies). Polonius is stabbed by Hamlet while spying on him.<p>



<p>



<li> Hamlet's trusted friend is Horatio. Oxford's most trusted relative seems to

have been Horace Vere, called Horatio in some documents (and so named by the

Dictionary of National Biography).<p>



<p>



<li> Oxford, like Hamlet, was captured by pirates en route to England; both

participated in sea battles.<p></ul>



<p>



The parallels between Hamlet and Oxford, ignored by conventional scholarship,

were first discovered by J. Thomas Looney (pronounced "LOE-ny," but the harm's

been done), an English schoolmaster whose book "Shakespeare" Identified in

Edward de Vere was published in 1920. If it is ever vindicated--as is still

possible--it will far surpass Heinrich Schliemann's discovery of Troy in the

annals of amateur scholarship. Among Looney's converts were Sigmund Freud and

John Galsworthy, who said that Looney's book was "the best detective story I

have ever read." Looney (who refused his publisher's understandable suggestion

that he consider using a pseudonym) died in 1944, his theory widely ignored.

After the prolonged controversy over the proposition that Francis Bacon was the

real author of the Shakespeare canon, the proposal of yet another candidate

seemed to be mere desperation. But Looney had found a candidate far more

interesting, and plausible, than the Baconians or anyone else ever had.<p>



<p>



Oxford's life posed an obvious challenge for Looney and his followers (known as

Oxfordians), however. The earl's death preceded the Stratford man's by twelve

years. Plays dated after 1604, or references in the plays to topical events in

the years 1604-1616 (should any be found), would expose Oxford to anachronism.

Conventional dating holds that there are ten such plays (I'm not counting Two

Noble Kinsmen). And orthodox scholars claim that there is one such topical

reference--to the "still-vex'd Bermoothes," in Act I of The Tempest. This is

believed to refer to a 1609 shipwreck in Bermuda, not heard of in England until

1610.<p>



<p>



Leaving The Tempest aside for a moment, the nine remaining post-1604 plays are

amenable to earlier dating without contradicting any known facts. The date of

their composition is quite uncertain, many having appeared for the first time

in the posthumous First Folio (1623). Some are dated late simply to fit the

period when the Stratford man (1564-1616) is thought to have been in London. He

couldn't have been there much before 1587, and there are already numerous signs

of uncomfortably early authorship--a published reference to Hamlet in 1589, for

example, when the Stratford man was twenty-five years old.<p>



<p>



The conventional dating of many of the supposedly post-1604 plays is more a

matter of giving breathing space to Stratfordian chronology than of letting the

facts speak for themselves. In addition, one or two conventional scholars date

King Lear before 1604; Pericles and Henry Vole were certainly worked on by

another hand; and there is nothing in the remainder--Macbeth, Timon of Athens,

Antony and Cleopatra, Coriolanus, Cymbeline, and The Winter's Tale--that

requires a post-1604 date. I believe that the latest source material undeniably

used by Shakespeare is John Florio's 1603 translation of Montaigne's essay "Of

the Cannibals," which reappears in much the same words in Act II of The

Tempest. Stratfordians have always insisted that this is a late play, and

Oxfordians are happy to agree with them.<p>



<p>



Orthodox research into Shakespeare's sources barely conflicts with this

analysis. The entire eight volumes of Geoffrey Bullough's Narrative and

Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare contain only one source that is dated after

1604 and deemed a certain, rather than possible or probable, source. This is

William Strachey's account of the 1609 shipwreck in Bermuda. In fact, however,

there is nothing in Strachey that is certainly in The Tempest, although his

description of St. Elmo's fire in the rigging does suggest Ariel's magical

powers ("On the topmast, the yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly").

Furthermore, there is nothing in The Tempest that was not known to

Elizabethans. If "Bermoothes" is taken as a reference to Bermuda, Oxfordians

point out, not only does Hakluyt's Principal Navigations (1598-1600) contain an

account of a 1593 shipwreck in Bermuda, but a decade earlier the Earl of Oxford

himself had invested in--possibly even owned--the Edward Bonaventure, one of

the ships involved in that wreck.<p>



<p>



Looney, however, did not know this. Uncharacteristically deferring to the

authority of Chambers and other conventional scholars on this point, he

accepted the conventional date for The Tempest (1611). In his final chapter,

therefore, Looney argued that the play did not belong in the Shakespeare canon.

As it is thought to include some of Shakespeare's best verse, this greatly

weakened Looney's case. By the time Hakluyt's references to Bermuda were

pointed out, Looney had come to seem discredited. In Shakespeare and His

Betters (1958), an attack on the anti-Stratfordian heresy, R. C. Churchill

claimed that the date of Oxford's death was "decisive" against his candidacy

for authorship. In Shakespeare's Lives (1970), S. Schoenbaum more cautiously

argued that "The Tempest presents Looney with his greatest challenge, for

topical references and other internal considerations lead him to accept the

late date to which the commentators assign it."<p>



<p>



In recent years, however, the earl's fortunes have revived somewhat. Charlton

Ogburn's huge book The Mysterious William Shakespeare was published in 1984,

attracting many converts to the cause. In the fall of 1987 David Lloyd Kreeger,

a Washington philanthropist who died last year, organized a moot-court debate

on the authorship question at The American University, presided over by three

Supreme Court Justices (William Brennan, Harry Blackmun, and John Paul

Stevens). They awarded the verdict to the Stratford man, but Oxford benefited

mightily from the exposure.<p>



<p>



At the end of his opinion Justice Stevens noted that "the Oxfordian case

suffers from not having a single, coherent theory of the case." True, but most

Oxfordians (not all, alas) would subscribe to something like the following:<p>



<p>



There did exist a man named William Shakspere, of Stratford, but the plays and

poems attributed to William Shakespeare were in fact written by Edward de Vere,

the Earl of Oxford, the Lord Great Chamberlain and senior earl of England,

early a favorite of Queen Elizabeth and usually on good terms with her.

(Henceforward I will use "Shakspere" to denote the man from Stratford and

"Shakespeare" to denote the author of the plays, whoever he was.) There is

abundant evidence, discomforting to Stratfordians, that many of the existing

plays are rewritten versions of earlier plays or, more simply date from a time

that would require prodigious effort on the part of the Stratford man. Perhaps

as many as a dozen plays were written before the Stratford man reached his

thirty-first birthday. Oxfordians believe that Oxford wrote the earlier plays

for court performance in the 1580s--when Oxford was in his thirties--and that

they were later revised for the public theater. Not until 1598 was the name

Shakespeare appended to plays. Before then, all published quartos of plays

subsequently attributed to Shakespeare had no name on the title page. In

associating himself with and writing for the public theater, Oxford was both

slumming and enjoying himself--and taking the opportunity to write figuratively

about events and people surrounding the court. As it was not acceptable for

noblemen to be associated with public (as opposed to court) theater, Oxford

agreed to keep his family's name out of it. He wrote "not for attribution," as

we now say. Perhaps, as Justice Stevens suggested, the Queen herself so ordered

him. Possibly he was content to write pseudonymously without urging.<p>



<p>



The Earl of Oxford may have met the Stratford man in London at some point and

enlisted him as his "blind," or front man: Oxfordians disagree among themselves

about this key point. A variant of this theory holds that Oxford was already

using the name Shakespeare when the Stratford man showed up in London. This is

less plausible, but it accommodates a contemporary document in which it is

reported that Gabriel Harvey, a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, praised

the Earl of Oxford in 1578 (in Latin) with the words "Thine eyes flash fire,

thy countenance shakes a spear." I shall simply assume that Shakspere was in

town seeking his fortune and that he and Oxford somehow established a

collaborative relationship. Oxford thereupon set Shakspere up as a shareholder

in the Chamberlain's Men, the theater company where Shakspere presumably worked

as a factotum and manager.<p>

 <font size=3><b>THE INADEQUACY OF THE STRATFORD MAN</font></b><p>



<p>



Writing in the mid-1840s Emerson admitted that he could not "marry" Shakspere's

life to Shakespeare's work: "Other admirable men have led lives in some sort of

keeping with their thought, but this man in wide contrast." That is the

anti-Stratfordian case in a nutshell. There is a great gulf between the life

and the work. Ivor Brown inadvertently drew attention to it in his 1949

biography of Shakespeare. "During 1598," he wrote, the Bard was "managing,

acting...and turning out plays (two or three a year was his pace at this time)

and yet keeping an eye on malt and [Stratford] matters." In 1604 Shakspere sued

the Stratford apothecary for the balance of an account for malt, and for a debt

of two shillings. But "it may have been Mrs. Anne Shakespeare who forced this

into court," Brown continued. "Shakespeare himself was then at the top of his

performance in [the] tragedy period...." Hmmmmm.<p>



<p>



No amount of research has been able to narrow this gulf. In some respects

research has widened it. At the time of the Restoration, forty-four years after

the Stratford man's death, knowledge of Shakespeare was so poor that the plays

bound together for the library of Charles II and labeled "Shakespeare. Vol. I."

were Mucedorus, Fair Em, and The Merry Devil of Edmonton, which are not

accepted today as Shakespeare's. Textual scholarship only later clarified the

canon, and tremendous archival digging in the nineteenth and twentieth

centuries turned up quite a bit of information about Shakspere's life. But (if

we exclude posthumous testimony) none of it establishes Shakspere as a

playwright. With the rise of critical scholarship, poetic images of the

Stratford man, told as fables at second and third hand in the eighteenth

century, have mostly been overthrown as unreliable.<p>



<p>



S. Schoenbaum, who more than most biographers has eschewed the "perhaps" that

links Shakspere to so much of Elizabethan life, was reduced by his own

scrupulosity in his Documentary Life (1975) to presenting scraps of paper that

show little more than routine transactions--Stratford tithes, Southwark tax

records, and documents involving "petty disputes over money matters." Echoes of

the plays are few, faint, and unconvincing.<p>



<p>



The Stratfordians have a point when they tell us we know quite a lot about

Shakspere--more than we do about Christopher Marlowe, for example. It's WHAT we

know that causes difficulties, not how little. His father, the constable and

glover, could not write; he signed documents with a cross or made his mark.

Judith, Shakspere's younger daughter, "evidently took after her mother [Anne

Hathaway]--she couldn't write," A. L. Rowse reported. As for the older

daughter, Susanna, Joseph Quincy Adams, a former director of the Folger

Library, reproduced her wobbly signature in his Life of William Shakespeare,

but it does not encourage confidence that she was literate. Married to Dr. John

Hall, she lived on into the time of the English Civil War. After Hall's death a

surgeon visited her at Stratford because he wanted to see her husband's

manuscripts (not her father's). At that time she was unable to recognize her

own husband's handwriting. "Odd," Schoenbaum wrote. "Did she have learning

sufficient only to enable her to sign her name?"<p>



<p>



Which brings us to Shakspere's six uncontested signatures. They are painfully

executed in an uncertain hand, a historical embarrassment. Joseph M. English,

Jr., a documents examiner with the forensic-science laboratory at Georgetown

University, offered the provisional opinion (he had access only to

reproductions) that the signatures were those of a man not familiar with

writing his own name, particularly the latter part of it. The surviving record

does not contradict the possibility that Shakspere's level of literacy was no

greater than his daughter's. His signatures are appended to legal documents

only. There are no known manuscripts or letters by Shakspere. We have one

letter that was sent to him (but he is thought not to have received it). It

asks for a loan of [[sterling]]30.<p>



<p>



Shakspere is not known to have attended Stratford grammar school (the school

records have not survived), and no one who did attend it ever claimed to have

been his classmate. If he was a pupil, he probably was not one for long, as

orthodoxy concedes, because his father ran into financial difficulties.

Shakspere married at the age of eighteen and had three children (including

twins) before his twenty-first birthday, in 1585. Joseph Quincy Adams guessed

that Shakspere spent some time as a schoolmaster. The alternative he described

as follows:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

"If we are forced to think of him as early snatched from school, working all day in a butcher's shop, growing up in a home devoid of

books and of a literary atmosphere, and finally driven from his native town

through a wild escapade with village lads, we find it hard to understand how he

suddenly blossomed out as one of England's greatest men of letters with every

mark of literary culture."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



Several orthodox scholars, including Alfred Harbage, date the composition of

Love's Labour's Lost to the late 1580s. "What Shakespeare was doing at the age

of twenty-four or twenty-five we do not know," Harbage added. The play contains

allusions to the 1578 visit of Marguerite de Valois and Catherine de Medici to

the Court of Henry of Navarre at Nerac, the names of French courtiers remaining

unchanged in the play. Somehow the Stratford man found out about all this,

embodying it in a parody of court manners and literary fashions. "Unless there

was a source-play," Edmund Chambers wrote, "some English or French traveller

must have been an intermediary."<p>



<p>



The play was "a battle in a private war between court factions," according to

the Arden edition of Love's Labours Lost, with many indications that it had

been written first "for private performance in court circles," and then was

rewritten and published in quarto in 1598. It's hard to believe that Shakspere

started out as a court insider. "To credit that amazing piece of virtuosity to

a butcher boy who left school at 13 or even to one whose education was nothing

more than what a grammar school and residence in a little provincial borough

could provide is to invite one either to believe in miracles or to disbelieve

in the man of Stratford," wrote J. Dover Wilson, the editor of The New

Cambridge Shakespeare.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



In his prefatory poem in the first folio (1623), Ben Jonson misleadingly told

readers that Shakespeare had "small Latin and less Greek." Jonson also spread

the idea that Shakespeare was nature's child, who "wanted art." This falsely

implied that Shakespeare's poetry was the spontaneous, untutored babbling of a

provincial. John Milton picked up the refrain, writing in 1632 that the poet

"warble[d] his native wood-notes wild." The well-educated Milton probably

didn't realize that Shakespeare's vocabulary was twice his own. Shakespeare's

learning, worn so unostentatiously, didn't become apparent until much later.

The eighteenth-century editor George Steevens said of a portion of Titus

Andronicus: "This passage alone would sufficiently convince me that the play

before us was the work of one who was conversant with the Greek tragedies in

their original language. We have here a plain allusion to the Ajax of

Sophocles, of which no translation was extant in the time of Shakespeare."

Gilbert Highet, of Columbia University, said that "we can be sure" that

Shakespeare "had not read Aeschylus." (He meant that Shakspere had not.) "Yet

what can we say when we find some of Aeschylus' thoughts appearing in

Shakespeare's plays?"<p>



<p>



The Comedy of Errors was taken from a play by Plautus before it had been

published in English translation. The Rape of Lucrece is derived from the Fasti

of Ovid, of which there appears to have been no English version, according to

John Churton Collins, the author of Studies in Shakespeare (1904). Collins also

found in the plays "portions of Caesar, Sallust, Cicero and Livy." As for

modern languages, Charles T. Prouty, a professor at the University of Missouri,

concluded that Shakespeare "read both Italian and French and was familiar with

both Bandello and Bellefont." The dialogue in some scenes of Henry V is in

French, "grammatically accurate if not idiomatic," according to Sir Sidney Lee,

the influential Shakespeare scholar and the editor of the Dictionary of

National Biography. As noted above, Belleforest's Histoires Tragiques, which

contains the Hamlet story, had not been translated from the French by the time

Hamlet was written. Othello is based on a story in G. Giraldi Cinthio's

Hecatommithi, not translated from the Italian by the time of the play's first

performance. Andrew S. Cairncross, who in the 1930s espoused an

early-authorship theory of the plays, concluded that Shakespeare's "knowledge

and use" of Italian is "established." (Oxford wrote in French and Latin and,

having spent almost a year in Italy almost certainly knew Italian.)<p>



<p>



Meanwhile, we catch glimpses of Shakspere in London: In March of 1595, along

with William Kempe and Richard Burbage, he was recorded as a payee of the

Chamberlain's Men, for performances before Her Majesty the previous December at

Greenwich. In 1596 William Wayte "craves sureties of the peace against

Shakspere" and others "for fear of death." In 1597 and 1598 the Stratford man

was listed as a tax defaulter in Bishopsgate ward. In Stratford he was among

the "wicked people" named as stockpiling grain at a time of famine in 1598. A

year earlier he bought New Place, the second-largest house in Stratford, for

[[sterling]]60, but he "did not live there permanently until his retirement, c.

1610," wrote F. E. Halliday in A Shakespeare Companion, a standard reference

work. In London there was no recorded reaction to his death, in 1616--an

extraordinary oversight, considering that the city went into mourning when the

actor Richard Burbage died, three years later.<p>



<p>



The playwright "spent some years before his death at his native Stratford,"

according to his first biographer, Nicholas Rowe, "in ease, retirement, and the

conversation of his friends." Schoenbaum granted him a "final non-literary

phase." How many writers retire in their forties? (Francis Beaumont, who died a

month before Shakspere, was said by Marchette Chute to have "retired" from

playwriting in his late twenties, but a recent study argued that he had

suffered a stroke.) It seems unlikely that Shakspere really did retire,

however, for in 1613 we find him again back in London--buying property in

Blackfriars and mortgaging it the next day. Shakspere's will, first prepared in

January of 1616, itemizing such minutiae as a silver-gilt bowl, his own

clothes, his plate, and his second-best bed (this last to his wife), mentions

no books or manuscripts. This was the will of someone concerned about and

attentive to details--but these did not include the disposition of his literary

remains. At this point just over half the plays had not been published

anywhere.<p>



<p>



"Circumstances were uniquely favorable to the retention of any products of his

pen had there been any," Charlton Ogburn wrote.<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

"His last years were spent in affluent leisure in a fine house he had owned for

two decades, and this house remained in the possession of his daughter and then

granddaughter while three collected editions of Shakespeare's plays were

published in which their author was hailed as his nation's triumph. Are we

really to imagine that nothing in the form of a letter, a note, a bit of

manuscript, would have remained of Shakspere's had he been the greatest of

writers?"

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



As far as I know, at no point in Shakspere's lifetime was the claim made that

he had written anything, nor do we have any evidence that he was ever paid for

writing. Shakspere himself makes no authorial claim in the anecdotes that have

come down to us. In his fugitive appearances he is businesslike rather than

literary. In the words of Joseph Sobran, the columnist and National Review

critic at large, he remains throughout "a singularly taciturn fountain of

eloquence."<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=3><b>THE VIRTUOSITY OF DE VERE</font></b><p>



<p>



As a young man, de Vere "dazzled the queen and absorbed the attention of her

leisure moments," according to one historian. An uncle of his, Henry Howard,

introduced the sonnet form in English; another uncle, Arthur Golding, who was

probably also De Vere's tutor, translated Ovid's Metamorphoses, an important

Shakespeare source. When Oxford was nineteen, a copy of the Amyot (French)

translation of Plutarch's Lives was bought for him; a letter written by him in

French at the age of thirteen survives. He "won for himself an honorable place

among the early masters of English poetry," Thomas Macaulay wrote. Of all the

courtier poets, Chambers wrote, "the most hopeful" was De Vere, but he "became mute in late life."<p>



<p>



In deference to the taboo against noblemen's using their own names, only one

published poem disclosed Oxford's authorship. (Others used the initials "E.O.,"

and may have been published without his permission.) Steven W. May, of

Georgetown College, Kentucky, an expert on Oxford's poetry has reduced to

sixteen the canon of his certain poems. "His latest extant poem was composed no

later than 1593," according to May. This happens to be the year of

Shakespeare's first poem (Venus and Adonis). What has survived of Oxford's

poetry does not rival Shakespeare's, but most of his known poems were written

when Oxford was young, probably in his early twenties. According to Ward

Elliott, of Claremont McKenna College, in California, who has researched the

authorship question with statistical techniques, some of Oxford's known poems

may have been composed when the earl was sixteen or younger.<p>



<p>



Oxford's oldest daughter, Elizabeth Vere, was in the early 1590s engaged to

marry Henry Wriothesley, the third Earl of Southampton, to whom Venus and

Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece were dedicated. Burghley and Oxford tried to

persuade the rich youth to marry the girl (Oxford had sold off an uncomfortably

large portion of his inheritance by this time), but Southampton declined (and

was apparently fined by Burghley for doing so). Shakespeare's sonnets, or most

of them, are believed to have been written in the early to mid-1590s, and

Southampton's three biographers believe that he was the sonnets' "onlie

begetter." The poet, in any event, is feeling his age, speaking of the

"wrackful siege of battering days," weeping for "precious friends hid in

death's dateless night" and "all those friends which I thought buried," and

missing his "lovers gone." In the mid-1590s the Stratford man wasn't thirty

years old, yet in Sonnet 73 we read: <p>



<p>



<p>



"That time of year thou mayst in me behold<p>



<p>



When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang<p>



<p>



Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,<p>



<p>



Bare ruin'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang."<p>



<p>



<p>



Soon after undertaking his quest for the true author of Shakespeare's works,

Looney turned to the Dictionary of National Biography, where he read:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

"Oxford, despite his violent and perverse temper, his eccentric taste in dress,

and his reckless waste of his substance, evinced a genuine interest in music,

and wrote verses of much lyric beauty. Puttenham and Meres reckon him among

'the best for comedy' in his day; but, although he was a patron of players, no

specimens of his dramatic productions survive."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



In 1567 Oxford was admitted to Gray's Inn, where he studied law and probably

became acquainted with the dramatists and literary figures who frequented the

Inns of Court at the time. He took over the Earl of Warwick's acting company in

1580, and in 1583 leased Blackfriars Theatre for his own boys' company of

players; he transferred the lease to John Lyly, an early Elizabethan dramatist

who was also Oxford's private secretary. "In comedy," R. Warwick Bond wrote in

an introduction to Lyly's Complete Works, "Lyly is Shakespeare's only model."

(But if Oxfordianism triumphs, the relationship between Lyly and Shakespeare

will have to be reversed.) "There is little doubt that the Earl himself

collaborated in the writing and production of Lyly's Court Comedies," wrote

Oxford's biographer, B. M. Ward. In 1593 Gabriel Harvey ambiguously referred to

Lyly as "the fiddlestick of Oxford." Oxford was four years older than Lyly.<p>



<p>



According to The Cambridge History of English Literature, "the earl of Oxford's

company of players acted in London between 1584 and 1587." At that time the

public theater was considered to be a low-rent and low-life enterprise. Lords

and ladies didn't exactly go to opening nights at the Globe. It's suggestive

that in 1587 Burghley complained in a letter to Sir Francis Walsingham that

Oxford's "lewd friends...still rule him by flatteries." Sidney Lee wrote that

Oxford Squandered some part of his fortune upon men of letters whose bohemian

mode of life attracted him." Sir George Buc, a poet and Deputy Master of the

Revels, deplored Oxford's "waste" of his earldom but thought him a "magnificent

and a very learned and religious man." In 1573 three of Oxford's rude

companions staged a mock robbery (or possibly it was intended as a real one) of

two men formerly employed by the boisterous young earl, "by the highway from

Gravesend to Rochester," according to a letter of complaint that the victims

promptly wrote to Burghley. In Henry IV, Part I, Falstaff and three of Prince

Hal's companions hold up some travelers on the highway near Gadshill--which is

on the highway between Gravesend and Rochester.<p>



<p>



Did Oxford write plays? In 1589 the author of the Arte of English Poesie

(thought to be George Puttenham) praised Oxford "for Comedy and Enterlude," and

in Palladis Tamia (1598) Francis Meres wrote that "the best for Comedy among us

be Edward Earl of Oxford." Admittedly, in the same famous passage Meres also

praises "Shakespeare" and lists twelve of his plays. It can be argued, however,

that Meres either knew Oxford's secret and kept it or innocently believed that

Oxford and Shakespeare had separate identities. If he knew the secret, he was

presumably discouraged from revealing it by the same social system that

prevailed upon Oxford to hide his identity.<p>



<p>



In Oxford's case peer pressure to hide his name would have been strong. "Among

the nobility or gentry as may be very well seen in many laudable sciences and

especially in making poesie," Puttenham wrote in 1589,<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

"it is so come to pass that they have no courage to write and if they have are

loath to be known of their skill. So as I know very many notable gentlemen in

the Court that have written commendably, and suppressed it again, or else

suffered it to be published without their own names to it: as if it were a

discredit for a gentleman, to seem learned."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



He went on to describe "Noblemen and Gentlemen of Her Majesty's own servants,

who have written excellently well as it would appear if their doings could be

found out and made public with the rest, of which number is first that noble

gentleman Edward Earl of Oxford." In Shakespeare and His Betters, R. C.

Churchill was so confident that Oxford's death in 1604 ruled him out as the

Bard that he boldly asserted:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

"I believe it is as well for the officials of the [Oxfordian] Shakespeare

Fellowship that the Earl of Oxford is safely dead, for they would be in some

danger of being run through if they insulted the Earl in person by suggesting

he had written Shakespeare's plays. For a courtier brought up on Castiglione, a

greater insult could hardly be imagined."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



Which helps explain the use of a pseudonym.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Two characteristics of the Shakespeare canon suggest powerfully that its author

was not a small-town burgher but rather a well-traveled nobleman. One is the

very attitude. The author displays little sympathy for the class of upwardly

mobile strivers of which Shakspere was a preeminent member. Shakespeare

celebrates the faithful servant, but regards commoners as either humorous when

seen individually or alarming in mobs. Either way he is remote from them. The

concerns of the burgher are not his--hardly what one would expect from the pen

of a thrifty countryman new in the big city and rising fast. Shakespeare's

frequent disgust with court life sounds like the revulsion of a man who knew it

too well. His contempt for a climber like Malvolio in Twelfth Night suggests a

writer who is by birth above social climbing and finds it laughable in his

inferiors. (Oxfordians, incidentally, make a strong case that the character of

Malvolio is based on Sir Christopher Hatron.) Louis Benezet, a professor at

Dartmouth (and an Oxfordian), noted in 1940 that Shakespeare's noblemen "are

natural, at ease, convincing."<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

"They talk the language of their class, both in matter and manner. They are

aristocrats to the core. On the other hand in portraying the lower classes

Shakespeare is unconvincing. He makes them clods or dolts or clowns, and has

them amuse us by their gaucheries. He gives them undignified names: Wart,

Bullcalf, Mouldy, Bottom, Dogberry, Snout...."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



Walt Whitman noted the same thing. "The comedies," he wrote, "have the

unmistakable hue of plays, portraits, made for the divertissement only of the

elite of the castle, and from its point of view. The comedies are altogether

non-acceptable to America and Democracy."<p>



<p>



Whitman was an agnostic anti-Stratfordian; his comments (1888) on the

historical plays are remarkable. The histories suggest, he wrote, "explanations

that one dare not put into plain statement." But then he added:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

"Conceiv'd out of the fullest heat and pulse of European

feudalism--personifying in unparallel'd ways the medieval aristocracy, its

towering spirit of ruthless and gigantic caste, its own peculiar air and

arrogance (no mere imitation)--only one of the 'wolfish earls' so plenteous in

the plays themselves, or some born descendant and knower, might seem to be the

true author of those amazing works...."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



We find in Sonnet 91 (and is this the voice of our litigious grain-hoarder from

Stratford?):<p>



<p>



"Thy love is better than high birth to me,...<p>



<p>



Of more delight than hawks or horses be.<p>



<p>



In Sonnet 125 the poet wrote, "Were't aught to me I bore the canopy." We know

that Oxford was one of those entitled to bear the canopy over the monarch, and

according to Oxford's biographer, a contemporary ballad tells us that in a

thanksgiving procession after the defeat of the Armada, "the noble Earl of

Oxford then High Chamberlain of England / Rode right before Her Majesty his

bonnet in his hand."<p>



<p>



The second characteristic of the canon which points away from 

Shakspere--and toward Oxford--is the author's apparent knowledge of foreign 

lands.  Shakespeare's "knowledge of Italy was extraordinary," the historian 

Hugh Trevor-Roper wrote.  "An English scholar who lived in Venice has found 

his visual topographic exactitude in The Merchant of Venice incredible in 

one who had never been there." Edmund Chambers allowed that the playwright 

"seems to have been remarkably successful in giving a local colouring and 

atmosphere" to the plays set in Italy.  He even "shows familiarity with 

some minute points of local topography." Karl Elze, the nineteenth-century 

German scholar pointed out that in his description of Venice, Shakespeare 

"does not confound the Isola de Rialto with the Ponte di Rialto." As a 

result, Chambers said, "much research has been devoted to a conjecture that 

he spent some time in Italy.  But it is implausible that the Stratford man 

ever went abroad.  Travel to the Continent was both dangerous and 

expensive.  When Edward de Vere set off for France in January of 1575, he 

was accompanied by "two gentlemen, two grooms, one payend, a harbinger, a 

housekeeper, and a trencherman," Lord Burghley noted for his records.<p>



<p>



Oxford and party stayed six weeks or more in Paris and were introduced to the

French King, Henry III. It is possible that at this time Oxford met Henry of

Navarre (King of France 1589-1610), whose brother-in-law, the Duke of Alencon,

was then being considered as a husband for Queen Elizabeth. Henry of Navarre

and Oxford were about the same age, and in many respects Henry seems to have

been a man after Oxford's own heart. We know, in any event, that Oxford later

kept in touch with the French ambassador in London; and we know that

Shakespeare was familiar with some details of the Navarre court in 1578

(described in Love's Labours Lost).<p>



<p>



Oxford went to Strasbourg, and thence to Italy, arriving in Padua in May. "For

fear of the Inquisition I dare not pass by Milan, the Bishop whereof exerciseth

such tyranny," he wrote to Burghley. From Padua he traveled to Genoa, later

returning to Padua. In September he was in Venice. Here he borrowed 500 crowns

from one Baptista Nigrone; then in December he received a further remittance

through a Pasquino Spinola. In The Taming of the Shrew the rich gentleman of

Padua whose shrewish daughter Petruchio will tame is called Baptista Minola,

and his "crowns" are repeatedly mentioned.<p>



<p>



Oxford then traveled to Florence and Siena. He was also reported to have been

in Sicily, "a famous man of chivalry," who challenged all comers to a contest

with "all manner of weapons." In a book published in Naples in 1699 he was

described as participating in a mock tournament staged by the Commedia dell'

Arte; the account implied that he was a familiar figure at these performances.

In 1936 George Lyman Kittredge, of Harvard, pointed out that "the influence of

the Italian commedia dell' arte is visible throughout" Love's Labour's Lost.

"Several of the figures correspond to standard figures of the Italian

convention...."<p>



<p>



By March of 1576 Oxford was back in Paris, having stopped en route at Lyons. A

striking echo of Oxford's life and travels is found in All's Well That Ends

Well. Here is Looney's description of the principal character, Bertram. Almost

everything that follows also applied to Oxford:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

"A young lord of ancient lineage, of which he is himself proud, having lost a

father for whom he entertained a strong affection, is brought to court by his

mother and left there as a royal ward, to be brought up under royal

supervision. As he grows up he asks for military service and to be allowed to

travel, but is repeatedly refused or put off. At last he goes away without

permission. Before leaving he had been married to a young woman with whom he

had been brought up, and who had herself been most active in bringing about the

marriage. Matrimonial troubles, of which the outstanding feature is a refusal

of cohabitation, are associated with both his stay abroad and his return

home."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



There's one final point about All's Well. Bertram is brought to Helena's bed in

the mistaken belief that he is visiting his mistress. (Shakespeare employed the

same ruse in Measure for Measure.) In an 1836 account, The Histories of Essex,

it was said of the Earl of Oxford: "He forsook his lady's bed, [but] the father

of Lady Anne [Lord Burghley] by stratagem, contrived that her husband should

unknowingly sleep with her, believing her to be another woman, and she bore a

son to him in consequence of this meeting."<p>



<p>



It's hard to believe that this really did happen to Oxford (or to anyone else).

But it's suggestive that the story was told of him in particular.<p>

Oxford's wife died in 1588. Three years later he married Elizabeth Trentham,

one of the Queen's maids of honor. In 1596 they moved into a large house (which

she bought) in Hackney, three or four miles from London's center. About the

last decade of his life we have little information. "It is almost impossible to

penetrate the obscurity surrounding his life at Hackney," B.M. Ward wrote

(1928). "There can be little doubt that literature, his main interest in life,

occupied the greater part of his time."<p>



<p>



Almost alone among Elizabethan poets, Shakespeare wrote no eulogy on the death

of the Queen, in 1603. Oxford himself died at Hackney in June of 1604, it is

thought of the plague. In 1622, the year before the publication of the Folio,

Henry Peacham published a book with a chapter on poetry. Elizabeth's reign had

been a "golden age," he wrote therein, listing (in order of rank) those who had

"honoured poesie with their pens and practice." First was "Edward Earl of

Oxford." Edmund Spenser and Philip Sidney made the list. There was no mention

of Shakespeare.<p>



<p>



The post-1604 period, potentially so perilous for Oxford, turns out to contain

surprises--for Stratfordians. The Bard appears to have continued writing, but

with a collaborator. Sidney Lee, a pillar of Stratfordian orthodoxy, believed

that Shakespeare "reverted [in 1607] to his earlier habit of collaboration, and

with another's aid composed two dramas--Timon of Athens and Pericles." How

about the possibility that he had died, leaving unfinished work that was

completed by another hand? The first two acts of Pericles, it is generally

agreed, are not by Shakespeare at all.<p>



<p>



From 1594 to 1604 plays by Shakespeare had been published regularly in London

in quarto editions. But then publication stopped for some reason until 1608,

and the appearance of Lear. In 1609 the sonnets were published, with a preface

referring to "our ever-living poet." The phrase strongly suggests that the poet

was dead. The title, Shake-speares Sonnets (rather than Sonnets by

Shakespeare), also implies that additions are not to be expected. "The numerous

misprints indicate that the poet who took such pains with Venus and Adonis and

The Rape of Lucrece had no part in supervising the printing of his most

important body of non-dramatic verse," Schoenbaum wrote.<p>



<p>



In 1607 a poet named William Barksted said of Shakespeare, "His was worthy

merit." Shakspere had nine years to live.<p>



<p>



In 1605 The London Prodigal was published in quarto as "By William

Shakespeare," and in 1608 A Yorkshire Tragedy was likewise published and

attributed. The King's Men also performed these plays, now known as apocryphal

and their authors having been lost to history. The Stratford man was alive,

supposedly still turning out plays himself, and certainly suing for malt debts

in Stratford. Why did he not object to the attachment of his good name to plays

that he did not write? It seems likely that the company, knowing that the real

playwright was dead, decided to go on using his name as a drawing card. There

had been other apocryphal plays, some appearing in quarto and attributed to

"W.S.," but all the evidence we have suggests it was only after Oxford's death

that the company openly used the name Shakespeare to advertise plays not by the

real author.<p>



<p>



In 1609 Troilus and Cressida was published in quarto, with the last few scenes

possibly "by another hand," according to the New Cambridge editors. The first

edition included a strange preface--dropped from a second edition published

later that year--with the headline (ignored by Stratfordians) "A never writer

to an ever reader. News." Oxfordians note that "ever" is an anagram of

"Vere."<p>



<p>



And I can't resist citing a similar play on words in these lines, fondly

regarded by Oxfordians, from Sonnet 76:<p>



<p>



"That every word doth almost tell my name,<p>



Showing their birth, and where they did proceed."

	</pre>

	

	<font size=5>A</font> SHORT time ago I found on a London bookstall an odd number of <I>The 

Poetry Review</I>, with examples of and comments on "Modern American 

Poets,"--examples which whetted my curiosity. But the few quotations given 

appeared to me literary bric-&agrave;-brac, the fruit of light 

<I>liaisons</I> between American dilettantism and European models. Such 

poetry, aesthetic or sentimental,--reflections of vagrant influences, 

lyrical embroideries in the latest designs, with little imaginative 

insight into life or nature,--abounds in every generation. If sufficiently 

bizarre its pretensions are cried up in small Bohemian coteries; if 

sufficiently orthodox in tone and form, it may impress itself on that 

public which reads poetry as it looks idly at pictures, with sentimental 

appetite or from a vague respect for "culture." Next I turned to some 

American magazines at hand, and was brought to a pause by discovering some 

interesting verse by modern American poets, especially by women whose 

sincerity in the expression of the inner life of love compared well with 

the ambitious flights of some of the rivals. I learned indeed from a 

magazine article that the "New Poetry" was in process of being hatched out 

by the younger school; and, no doubt, further researches would have 

yielded a harvest, had not a literary friend chanced to place in my hands 

a slim green volume, <I>North of Boston</I>, by Robert Frost. I read it, 

and reread it. It seemed to me that this poet was destined to take a 

permanent place in American literature. I asked myself why this book was 

issued by an English and not by an American publisher. And to this 

question I have found no answer. I may add here, in parenthesis, that I 

know nothing of Mr. Robert Frost save the three or four particulars I 

gleaned from the English friend who sent me <I>North of Boston</I>.<P>

     In an illuminating paper on recent American fiction which I hope by 

and by, with the editor's permission, to discuss along with Mr. Owen 

Wister's smashing onslaught in the <I>Atlantic Monthly</I>, Mr. W. D. 

Howell's remarks, "By test of the native touch we should not find genuine 

some of the American writers whom Mr. Garnett accounts so." No doubt Mr. 

Howells's stricture is just, and certain American novelists--whom he does 

not however particularize--have been too affected in spirit by European 

models. Indeed Frank Norris's early work, <I>Vandover and the Brute</I>, 

is quite continental in tone; and it is arguable that his study of the 

French Naturalists may have shown beneficial results later, in the breadth 

of scheme and clarity of <I>The Pit</I>. <P>

     This point of "the native touch" raises difficult questions, for the 

ferment of foreign influence has often marked the point of departure and 

rise of powerful native writers, such as Pushkin in Russia and Fenimore 

Cooper in America. Again, if we consider the fiction of Poe and Herman 

Melville, would it not be difficult to assess their genuineness by any 

standard or measure of "native touch"? But I take it that Mr. Howells 

would ban as "not genuine" only those writers whose originality in vision, 

tone, and style has been patently marred or nullified by their surrender 

to exotic influences.<P>

     So complex may be the interlacing strains that blend in a writer's 

literary ancestry and determine his style, that the question first to ask 

seems to me whether a given author is a fresh creative force, an original 

voice in literature. Such an authentic original force to me speaks from 

<I>North of Boston</I>. Surely a genuine New England voice, whatever be 

its literary debt to old-world English ancestry. Originality, the point is 

there,--for we may note that originality of tone and vision is always the 

stumbling-block to the common taste when the latter is invited to readjust 

its accepted standards.<P>

     On opening <I>North of Boston</I> we see the first lines to be 

stamped with the magic of <I>style</I>, of a style that obeys its own laws 

of grace and beauty and inner harmony.<P>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

Something there is that doesn't love a wall,<br>

That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,<BR>

And spills the upper boulders in the sun;<BR>

And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.<BR>

The work of hunters is another thing:<BR>

I have come after them and made repair<BR>

Where they have left not one stone on stone,<BR>

But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,<BR>

To please the yelping dogs. . . .<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>







     Note the clarity of the images, the firm outline. How delicately the 

unobtrusive opening suggests the countryman's contemplative pleasure in 

his fields and woods. It seems so very quiet, the modern reader may 

complain, forgetting Wordsworth; and indeed, had Wordsworth written these 

lines, I think they must have stood in every English anthology. And when 

we turn the page, the second poem, "The Death of the Hired Man," proves 

that this American poet has arrived, not indeed to challenge the English 

poet's possession of his territory, but to show how untrodden, how 

limitless are the stretching adjacent lands. "The Death of the Hired Man" 

is a dramatic dialogue between husband and wife, a dialogue characterized 

by an exquisite precision of psychological insight. I note that two 

college professors have lately been taking Mr. Ruckstuhl to task for a new 

definition of poetry. Let us fly all such debates, following Goethe, who, 

condemning the "aesthete who labors to express the nature of poetry and of 

poets," exclaimed, "What do we want with so much definition?  A lively 

feeling of situations and an aptitude to describe them makes the poet." 

This definition, though it does not cover the whole ground, is apropos to 

our purpose.<P>

     Mr. Frost possesses a keen feeling for situation. And his fine, sure 

touch in clarifying our obscure instincts and clashing impulses, and in 

crystallizing them in sharp, precise images,--for that we cannot be too 

grateful. Observe the tense, simple dramatic action, foreshadowing 

conflict, in the opening lines of "The Death of the Hired Man":<P>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table<BR>

Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,<BR>

She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage<BR>

To meet him in the doorway with the news<BR>

And put him on his guard. "Silas is back."<BR>

She pushed him outward with her through the door<BR>

And shut it after her. "Be kind," she said.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>







     "It's we who must be good to him now," she urges. I wish I had space 

to quote the debate so simple in its homely force, so comprehending in its 

spiritual veracity; but I must restrict myself to these arresting lines 

and to the hushed, tragic close:--<P>







<BLOCKQUOTE>

Part of a moon was falling down the west<BR>

Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills.<BR>

Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw<BR>

And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand<BR>

Among the harp-like morning-glory strings<BR>

Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,<BR>

As if she played unheard the tenderness<BR>

That wrought on him beside her in the night.<BR>

"Warren," she said, "he has come home to die:<BR>

You needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time."<P>



"Home," he mocked gently.<P>





<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" width=108 height=1> "Yes, what else but home?<BR>              

It all depends on what you mean by home.<BR>

Of course he's nothing to us, any more<BR>

Than was the hound that came a stranger to us<BR>

Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail."<P>



"Home is the place where, when you have to go there,<BR>

They have to take you in."<P>



<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" width=108 height=1> "I should have called it<BR>

Something you somehow haven't to deserve."<P>

"You'll be surprised at him--how much he's broken,<BR>

His working days are done; I'm sure of it."<P>



"I'd not be in a hurry to say that."<P>



"I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself.<BR>

But, Warren, please remember how it is:<BR>

He's come to help you ditch the meadow.<BR>

He has a plan. You mustn't laugh at him.<BR>

He may not speak of it, and then he may.<BR>

I'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud<BR>

Will hit or miss the moon."<P>



<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" width=108 height=1> "It hit the moon.<BR>

Then there were three there making a dim row,<BR>

The moon, the little silver cloud, and she.<P>



Warren returned--too soon, it seemed to her,<BR>

Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited.<P>



"Warren," she questioned.<P>



<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" width=108 height=1> "Dead," was all he answered.<P>





</BLOCKQUOTE>



               

               

     Yes, this is poetry, but of what order? the people may question, to 

whom for some reason poetry connotes the fervor of lyrical passion, the 

glow of romantic color, or the play of picturesque fancy. But it is 

precisely its quiet passion and spiritual tenderness that betray this to 

be poetry of a rare order, "the poetry of a true real natural vision of 

life," which, as Goethe declared, "demands descriptive power of the 

highest degree, rendering a poet's pictures so lifelike that they become 

actualities to every reader." One may indeed anticipate that the 

"honorable minority" will appraise highly the spiritual beauty of the 

lines above quoted.<P>

     But what of his unconventional <I>genre</I> pictures, such as "A 

Hundred Collars"? Is it necessary to carry the war against the enemy's 

cardboard fortresses of convention by using Goethe's further 

declaration:--<P>

     "At bottom no subject is unpoetical, if only the poet knows how to 

treat it aright." The dictum is explicit: "A true, real, natural vision of 

life . . . high descriptive power . . . pictures of lifelike actuality . . 

. a lively feeling of situation"--if a poet possess these qualifications 

he may treat any theme or situation he pleases. Indeed, the more prosaic 

appears the vesture of everyday life, the greater is the poet's triumph in 

seizing and representing the enduring human interest of its familiar 

features. In the characteristic fact, form, or feature the poet no less 

than the artist will discover essential lines and aspects of beauty. 

Nothing is barred to him, if he only have <I>vision</I>. Even the most 

eccentric divagations in human conduct can be exhibited in their true 

spiritual perspective by the psychologist of insight, as Browning 

repeatedly demonstrates. One sees no reason why Browning's "Fra Lippo 

Lippi" with all its roughcast philosophic speculation should be "poetry" 

and Mr. Frost's "A Hundred Collars" should not; and indeed the purist must 

keep the gate closed on both or on neither. If I desired indeed to know 

whether a reader could really detect the genuine poet, when he appears 

amid the crowd of <I>dilettanti</I>, I should ask his judgment on a 

typical uncompromising passage in "A Hundred Collars," such as the 

following:--<P>







<BLOCKQUOTE>





"No room," the night clerk said, "Unless--"<P>



Woodville's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps<BR>

And cars that shook and rattle--and <I>one</I> hotel.<P>



"You say 'unless.'"<P>



<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" width=72 height=1> "Unless you wouldn't mind<BR>

Sharing a room with some one else."<P>



<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" width=144 height=1>"Who is it?"<P>

                         

"A man."<P>



<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" width=36 height=1>"So I should hope. What kind of man?"<P>

     

"I know him: he's all right. A man's a man.<BR>

Separate beds of course you understand."<P>



The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on.<P>



"Who's that man sleeping in the office chair?<BR>

Has he had the refusal of my chance?"<P>



"He was afraid of being robbed or murdered.<BR>

What do you say?"<P>



<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" width=72 height=1> "I'll have to have a bed."<P>

               

The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs<BR>

And down a narrow passage full of doors,<BR>

At the last one of which he knocked and entered.<P>



"Lafe, here's a fellow wants to share your room."<P>



"Show him this way. I'm not afraid of him.<BR>

I'm not so drunk I can't take care of myself."<P>



The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot.<BR>

"This will be yours. Good night," he said, and went.<P>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>. . . .</B>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away.<BR>

A man? A brute. Naked above the waist,<BR>

He sat there creased and shining in the light,<BR>

Fumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt.<BR>

"I'm moving into a size-larger shirt.<BR>

I've felt mean lately; mean's no name for it.<BR>

I've found just what the matter was to-night:<BR>

I've been a-choking like a nursery tree<BR>

When it outgrows the wire band of its name-tag.<BR>

I blamed it on the hot spell we've been having.<BR>

'Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back,<BR>

Not liking to own up I'd grown a size.<BR>

Number eighteen this is. What size do you wear?"<P>



The Doctor caught his throat convulsively.<BR>

"Oh--ah--fourteen--fourteen."<p>





</BLOCKQUOTE>







     The whole colloquy between this tipsy provincial reporter, Lafayette, 

and the scared doctor, will, at the first blush, seem to be out of court 

to the ordinary citizen trained from childhood to recognize as "poetical," 

say Bryant's "Thanatopsis." The latter is a good example of "the noble 

manner," but the reader who enjoys it does not therefore turn away with a 

puzzled frown from Holmes's "The Wonderful One-hoss Shay."<P>

     But is Mr. Frost then a humorist? the reader may inquire, seeing a 

gleam of light. Humor has its place in his work; that is to say, our 

author's moods take their rise from his contemplative scrutiny of 

<I>character</I> in men and nature, and he responds equally to a tragic 

episode or a humorous situation. But, like creators greater in 

achievement, his humorous perception is interwoven with many other strands 

of apprehension, and in his <I>genre</I> pictures, sympathy blends with 

ironical appreciation of grave issues, to endow them with unique 

temperamental flavor. If one styled "Mending Wall" and "A Hundred Collars" 

idyls of New England life, the reader might remark sarcastically that they 

do not seem very idyllic; but idyls they are none the less, not in the 

corrupted sense of pseudo-Arcadian pastorals, but in the original meaning 

of "little pictures." One may contend that "The Housekeeper" is cast in 

much the same gossiping style as Theocritus's idyl, "The Ladies of 

Syracuse," with its prattle of provincial ladies over their  household 

affairs and the crush in the Alexandrian streets at the Festival of 

Adonis. And one may wager that this famous poem shocked the academic taste 

of the day by its unconventionality, and would not indeed, please modern 

professors, were it not the work of a Greek poet who lived three hundred 

years before Christ.<P>

     It is not indeed a bad precept for readers who wish to savor the 

distinctive quality of new original talents to judge them first by the 

<I>human interest</I> of what they present. Were this simple plan 

followed, a Browning or a Whitman would not be kept waiting so long in the 

chilling shadow of contemporary disapproval. Regard simply the people in 

Frost's dramatic dialogues, their motives and feelings, their intercourse 

and the clash of their outlooks, and note how these little canvases, 

painted with quiet, deep understanding of life's incongruous everyday web, 

begin to glow with subtle color. Observe how the author in "A Servant to 

Servants," picturing the native or local surroundings, makes the 

<I>essentials</I> live  and speak in a woman's homely confession of her 

fear of madness.<P>

     But it is best to give an example of Mr. Frost's emotional force, and 

in quoting a passage from "Home Burial" I say unhesitatingly that for 

tragic poignancy this piece stands by itself in American poetry. How 

dramatic is the action, in this moment of revelation of the tragic rift 

sundering man and wife!<P>





<BLOCKQUOTE>



He saw her from the bottom of the stairs<BR>

Before she saw him. She was starting down,<BR>

Looking back over her shoulder at some fear.<BR>

She took a doubtful step and then undid it<BR>

To raise herself and look again. He spoke,<BR>

Advancing toward her: "What is it you see<BR>

From up there always--for I want to know."<BR>

She turned and sank upon her skirts at that,<BR>

And her face changed from terrified to dull,<BR>

He said to gain time: "What is it you see,"<BR>

Mounting until she cowered under him.<BR>

"I will find out now--you must tell me, dear."<BR>

She, in her place, refused him any help<BR>

With the least stiffening of her neck and silence.<BR>

She let him look, sure that he wouldn't see,<BR>

Blind creature; and a while he didn't see.<BR>

But at last he murmured, "Oh," and again, "Oh."<P>



"What is it-- what?" she said.<P>



<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" width=144 height=1> "Just that I see."<P>

                    

"You don't," she challenged. "Tell me what it is."<P>



"The wonder is I didn't see at once.<BR>

I never noticed it from here before.<BR>

I must be wonted to it--that's the reason.<BR>

The little graveyard where my people are!<BR>

So small the window frames the whole of it.<BR>

Not so much larger than a bedroom, is it?<BR>

There are three stones of slate and one of marble,<BR>

Broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight,<BR>

On the sidehill. We haven't to mind <I>those</I>.<BR>

But I understand: it is not the stones,<BR>

But the child's mound--"<P>



"Don't, don't, don't, don't," she cried.<P>



</BLOCKQUOTE>





     He entreats his wife to let him into her grief, and not to carry it, 

this time, to some one else. He entreats her to tell him why the loss of 

her first child has bred in her such rankling bitterness toward him, and 

why every word of his about the dead child gives her such offense.<P>





<BLOCKQUOTE>



<img src="../../../images/transp.gif" width=108 height=1> --"And it's come to this,<BR>

A man can't speak of his own child that's dead."<P>



"You can't because you don't know how.<BR>

If you had any feelings, you that dug<BR>

With your own hand--how could you?--his little grave;<BR>

I saw you from that very window there, <BR>

Making the gravel leap and leap in air,<BR>

Leap up like that, like that, and land so lightly<BR>

And roll back down the mound beside the hole.<BR>

I thought, Who is that man? I didn't know you.<BR>

And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs<BR>

To look again, and still your spade kept lifting.<BR>

Then you came in. I heard your rumbling voice<BR>

Out in the kitchen, and I don't know why,<BR>

But I went near to see with my own eyes.<BR>

You could sit there with the stains on your shoes<BR>

Of the fresh earth from your own baby's grave<BR>

And talk about your everyday concerns.<BR>

You had stood the spade up against the wall<BR>

Outside there in the entry, for I saw it."<P>



"I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed.<BR>

I'm cursed, God, if I don't believe I'm cursed."<P>



"I can repeat the very words you were saying.<BR>

'Three foggy mornings and one rainy day<BR>

Will rot the best birch fence a man can build.'<BR>

Think of it, talk like that at such a time!<BR>

What had how long it takes a birch to rot<BR>

To do with what was in the darkened parlor.<BR>

You <I>couldn't</I> care! The nearest friends can go<BR>

With any one to death, comes so far short <BR>

They might as well not try to go at all.<BR>

No, from the time when one is sick to death,<BR>

One is alone, and he dies more alone.<BR>

Friends make pretence of following to the grave,<BR>

But before one is in it, their minds are turned<BR>

And making the best of their way back to life<BR>

And living people, and things they understand.<BR>

But the world's evil. I won't have grief so<BR>

Perhaps some readers, deceived by the supreme simplicity of this passage, 

may not see what art has inspired its perfect naturalness. It is indeed 

the perfection of poetic realism, both in observation and in deep insight 

into the heart. How well most of us know, after we have followed the 

funeral and stood by the grave-side of some man near to us, that baffled, 

uneasy self-questioning, "Why do I feel so little? Is it possible I have 

no more sorrow or regret to feel at this death?" But what other poet has 

said this with such moving, exquisite felicity?<P>

     I have quoted "Home Burial" partly from the belief that its dramatic 

intensity will best level any popular barrier to the recognition of its 

author's creative originality. But one does not expect that even a 

sensitive taste will respond so readily to the rare flavor of "The 

Mountain" as did the American people to Whittier's "Snowbound," fifty 

years back. The imagery of the Quaker poet's idyl, perfectly suited to its 

purpose of mirroring with faithful sincerity the wintry landscape and the 

pursuits and character of a New England farmer's family, is marked by no 

peculiar delicacy or originality of style. Mr. Frost, on the other hand, 

may disappoint readers who prefer grandeur and breadth of outline or 

magical depth of coloring to delicate atmospheric imagery.<P>

     But the attentive reader will soon discover that Mr. Frost's cunning 

impressionism produces a subtle cumulative effect, and that by his use of 

pauses, digressions, and the crafty envisagement of his subject at fresh 

angles, he secures a pervading feeling of the mass and movement and 

elusive force of nature. He is a master of his exacting medium, blank 

verse,--a new master. The reader must pause and pause again before he can 

judge him, so unobtrusive and quiet are these "effects," so subtle the 

appeal of the whole. One can, indeed, return to his poems again and again 

without exhausting their quiet imaginative spell. For instance, the reader 

will note how the feeling of the mountain's might bulk and hanging mass, 

its vast elbowing flanks, its watching domination of the near fields and 

scattered farmsteads, begins to grow upon him, till he too is possessed by 

the idea of exploring its high ravines, its fountain springs and granite 

terraces. One of the surest tests of fine art is whether our imagination 

barks back to it, fascinated in after contemplation, or whether our 

interest is suddenly exhausted both in it and the subject. And "The 

Mountain" shows that the poet has known how to seize and present the 

mysterious force and essence of living nature.<P>

     In nearly all Mr. Frost's quiet dramatic dialogues, his record of the 

present passing scene suggests how much has gone before, how much these 

people have lived through, what a lengthy chain of feelings and motives 

and circumstances has shaped their actions and mental attitudes. Thus in 

"The Housekeeper," his picture of the stout old woman sitting there in her 

chair, talking over Estelle, her grown-up daughter, who, weary of her 

anomalous position in the household, has left John and gone off and 

married another man, carries with it a rich sensation of the women's sharp 

criticism of a procrastinating obstinate man. John is too dense in his 

masculine way to know how much he owes to them. This psychological sketch 

in its sharp actuality is worthy of Sarah Orne Jewett.<P>

     But why put it in poetry and not in prose? the reader may hazard.  

Well, it comes with greater intensity in rhythm and is more heightened and 

concentrated in effect thereby. If the reader will examine "A Servant to 

Servants," he will recognize that this narrative of a woman's haunting 

fear that she has inherited the streak of madness in her family, would 

lose in distinction and clarity were it told in prose. Yet so 

extraordinarily close to normal everyday speech is it that I anticipate 

some academic person may test its metre with a metronome, and declare that 

the verse is often awkward in its scansion. No doubt. But so also is the 

blank verse of many a master hard to scan, if the academic footrule be not 

applied with a nice comprehension of where to give and when to take. In "A 

Servant to Servants" the tragic effect of this overdriven woman's 

unburdening herself of her load of painful memories and gloomy forebodings 

is  to my mind a rare artistic achievement, -- one that graves itself on 

the memory.<P>

     And now that we have praised <I>North of Boston</I> so freely, shall 

we not make certain stiff, critical reservations? Doubtless one would do 

so were one not conscious that Mr. Frost's fellow poets, his deserving 

rivals, will relieve one of the task. May I say to them here that because 

I believe Mr. Frost in <I>North of Boston</I> has found a way for himself, 

so I believe their roads lie also open before them. These roads are 

infinite, and will surely yield, now or to-morrow, vital discoveries. A 

slight defect of Mr. Frost's subtle realistic method, and one does not 

wish to slur it over, is that it is sometimes difficult to grasp all the 

implications and bearings of his situations. His language in "The 

Self-seeker" is highly figurative, too figurative perhaps for poetry. 

Again in "The Generations of Men," his method as art seems to be both a 

little casual and long-winded. In several of his poems, his fineness of 

psychological truth is perhaps in excess of his poetic beauty,--an 

inevitable defect of cool, fearless realism. And the corollary criticism 

no doubt will be heard, that from the intensity with which he makes us 

realize things we should gain a little more pleasure. But here one may add 

that there is pleasure and pleasure, and that it seems remarkable that 

this New England poet, so absorbed by the psychological drama of people's 

temperaments and conduct, should preserve such pure outlines and clear 

objectivity of style.<P>

     Is his talent a pure product of New England soil? I take it that just 

as Hawthorne owed a debt to English influence, so Mr. Frost owes one also. 

But his "native touch" is declared by the subtle blend of outspokenness 

and reticence, of brooding conscience and grave humor. Speaking under 

correction, it appears to me that his creative vision, springing from New 

England soil, and calmly handing on the best and oldest American 

tradition, may be a little at variance with the cosmopolitan clamor of New 

York. It would be quaint indeed if Americans who, according to their 

magazines, are opening their hospitable bosoms to Mr. Rabindranath 

Tagore's spiritual poems and dramas of Bengal life, should rest oblivious 

of their own countryman. To certain citizens Mr. Frost's poems of the life 

of inconspicuous, humble New England folk may seem unattractively homely 

in comparison with the Eastern poet's lofty, mystical dramas; but by 

American critics this view will doubtless be characterized as a 

manifestation of American provincialism. The critics know that a poet who 

has no "message" to deliver to the world, whose work is not only bare of 

prettiness and sentimentality but is isolated and unaffected by this or 

that "movement," is easily set aside. Nothing is easier, since his appeal 

is neither to the interests nor caprices of the market. Ours indeed is 

peculiarly the day when everything pure, shy, and independent in art seems 

at the mercy of those who beat the big drum and shout their wares through 

the megaphone. And knowing this, the critic of conscience will take for 

his watchword <I>quality</I>.<P>

     "Mr. Frost is a true poet, but not a <I>poetical</I> poet," remarked 

a listener to whom I read "A Servant to Servants," leaving me wondering 

whether his verdict inclined the scales definitely to praise or blame. Of 

poetical poets we have so many! of literary poets so many! of drawing-room 

poets so many!--of academic and dilettanti poets so many! of imitative 

poets so many! but of original poets how few!<P>

	<center><i><font size=4>Unlike nearly everyone in Japan and the rest of Asia, Americans want Japan to
spend more on its military, thinking that will equalize economic competition.
It won't.</i></font></center><p>
	
	
	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	
	<font size=5>A</font>merica's biggest delusion about Japan is that the "free ride" on defense that
we give Japan is the key to the two countries' problems. If we can only make
the Japanese pay for their own protection, many Americans feel, our economic
difficulties will work themselves out.<p>

<p>

Last fall, before he was nominated as Secretary of Defense, John Tower told a
Japanese interviewer what he later said during his confirmation hearings: that
Japan should change its Constitution if that's what it would take to start
spending more on defense. In its past session the U.S. Congress passed a
resolution demanding that Japan spend three percent of its gross national
product on defense, as opposed to the roughly one percent it spends now (and to
the seven percent the United States spends). "Our European partners spend about
three percent," an aide to Representative Duncan Hunter, of California, who
sponsored the resolution, said early this year. "It's entirely reasonable to
expect Japan to do the same." Last year Representative Patricia Schroeder, of
Colorado, recommended a "defense protection fee" on all Japanese imports, to
make the connection between our protection and their prosperity as bluntly
explicit as it can be: for each car the Japanese bring into America, they would
have to cover some of the cost of the American ships and planes that guard
Japan. Otherwise, why should the United States, with its huge deficits, keep
paying to protect a country whose surpluses pile up by the day?<p>

<p>

Behind these proposals, and the broader public grumbling about Japan's "free
ride," is the idea that America's economy has been hobbled by defense spending,
so in all fairness Japan's should be hobbled too. Or, to put it more
pleasantly, that Japan should take up some of America's burden, so that the two
economies can compete on a fairer and more equal basis. However it may be
phrased, the essential idea is that Japan has been imposing on our good will
for just about long enough. Who won the war, anyway? If the Japanese don t back
off from their aggressive trading practices, we will have to teach them a
lesson by withdrawing some of the military protection we magnanimously
provide.<p>

<p>

I think this concept has things exactly the wrong way around. The military
relationship between Japan and America, "free ride" and all, is much better for
each party than any alternative I've heard suggested so far. The division of
labor is complicated and obviously unequal--even if Japan is paying more and
more of the cost of defending its own home territory, it has nothing like
America's worldwide military costs. Still, it sounds easier to correct the
imbalance, by "making" Japan pay its way, than it turns out to be when you look
at the details. We can do ourselves a favor if we concentrate on our real
disagreements with Japan, about trade policy, and forget about the "free
ride."<p>

<p>

Before getting into the details, let's step back to consider how much damage
the defense imbalance does, and how the United States got itself in this bind.
Of course the difference between the Japanese and American defense budgets is
enormous, and is a significant economic problem for the United States. Some
Japanese officials have recently been trying to convince people that the
imbalance is not as large as it seems. After all, they point out, Japan is now
overtaking Britain and has the third-largest military budget in the world,
which sounds about right for a country with the world's second-largest economy.
"Third-largest," however, is completely misleading, because it reflects little
more than the enormous increase in the value of the yen. In 1985 Japan's
defense budget was the eighth largest in the world, comparable to those of such
questionable powers as Italy and Poland. Since then the budget as measured in
yen has gone up steadily but modestly, in pace with the Japanese economy as a
whole--from about 3.1 trillion yen in 1985 to about 3.7 trillion in 1988. As
measured in dollars, however, the budget zoomed upward by more than 200 percent
in those same three years. Because international budget comparisons are still
made in dollars, it's the exchange rate, rather than a real defense buildup,
that has propelled Japan toward the top of the charts. Even at these inflated
dollar-yen rates, Japan's defense spending is about one tenth of America's,
roughly $30 billion a year versus roughly $300 billion. If we use NATO's system
of measuring defense budgets, which includes (as Japan's does not) military
pensions and other costs in the total, Japan's spending comes to about 1.7
percent of its GNP. This is still much less than that of any major Western
country. In terms of the burden the country imposes on itself, Japan has at
most the twentieth-largest military budget in the world.<p>

<p>

U.S. industry is handicapped in a further way, relative to Japan's. When
American military interests have collided with the interests of American
companies, U.S. policy has favored the military. It is more convenient for
American commanders, for example, if allied nations all use similar equipment.
Therefore the Pentagon has willingly licensed advanced weapons technology to
NATO countries, Korea, and Japan, so that they can build compatible equipment
for themselves. The F-15s that are the backbone of Japan's air force are
manufactured in Japan, under license from McDonnell Douglas. This approach, of
course, erodes America's technical lead and in many cases has spawned direct
competition in the arms business.<p>

<p>

Japan's bias has been just the opposite of America's. Its military commanders
would be much better off if Japan imported its weapons, rather than building
them domestically in small, costly production runs. But, unlike the United
States, Japan can put commercial interests over military ones, so it spends 90
percent of its procurement money at home. Last year Japan faced a
black-and-white choice between military efficiency and promotion of its own
industry, when it selected a new fighter plane for its air force. Every factor
except industrial promotion pointed toward one decision: buying the F-16
fighter plane from the United States. The F-16 was available immediately, it
was battle-tested, and it was comparatively cheap. This is one case in which
every normal market standard favored the U.S.-made product.<p>

<p>

And yet Japan attempted for as long as possible to design and build an entirely
new airplane, all its own, as an entry to one of the few industries in which it
is still behind. The U.S. government was indignant about these plans. Japan
eventually threw us a sop, by agreeing to accept the blueprints and technical
specifications for the F-16, and, after modifying the wings and radar and
certain other parts, to build the new "FSX" planes in Japan, with some American
subcontracting. Japan's military will suffer from this deal. The planes won't
be ready until the middle of the next decade, and they will cost about twice as
much as F-16s. But Japanese industry will, for the first time, have the
experience of putting together a modern plane from drawing-board to final
assembly.<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE FSX deal is, as The New York Times said in an uncharacteristically
sharp-tongued editorial, "one-sided and unfair." But does it, or any other part
of the military-spending imbalance, mean that the United Suites can eliminate
its burden by changing its military relationship with Japan? Unfortunately, it
does not. In principle, Japan could solve the "free ride" problem in either of
two ways. It could spend much more on its own defense, or it could pay more of
America's costs--essentially hiring the United States for Pacific defense. The
United States will have a very hard time persuading Japan to do either.<p>

<p>

The first approach--putting pressure on Japan to expand its own military--would
be wildly unpopular in Japan and everywhere else in Asia. Japan and its
neighbors remember the Second World War in different ways, but the memory
leaves all of them hostile to the idea of a strongly re-armed Japan.<p>

<p>

It is hard for most Americans to imagine how deep is the fear of Japanese
rearmament that spreads across the rest of Asia--and that persists in Japan as
well. Someone who had never opened a history book might look at today's Japan
and conclude that the fear was completely absurd. This is about as
civilian-looking and nonmilitarized a society as you will find. True, many
parts of Japanese life do seem regimented and quasi-military. But these are the
civilian parts: the industries, where workers do calisthenics beneath snapping
company flags, with martial music booming through the air; the schools, where
boys wear shorts all through the winter to show that they are tough. The
fierceness and esprit in the military itself cannot compare. There are some
250,000 soldiers in the jieitai (literally, "self-defense force," rather than
"army"), but they're practically invisible. Soldiers refuse to wear their
uniforms in public; they commute in civilian clothes and change once they get
to work. In any case, the uniforms seem bus-conductor-like and deliberately
nonmartial, especially by comparison with the severe Prussian-style outfits
worn by high school students.<p>

<p>

Japan's equivalent of the Pentagon is situated near the Roppongi stop on
Tokyo's subway, in a chic tourist and nightclub district. If you ride the
Washington, D.C., Metro to the Pentagon stop, you will see uniformed soldiers
by the hundreds; I have never seen a uniform in the Roppongi crowds. The
Defense Agency proudly releases polls showing that Japanese people have a
favorable impression of the military. But according to these same polls, 77
percent of the Japanese public think that the military's most valuable function
has been to clean up after typhoons and provide other forms of disaster
relief.<p>

<p>

In today's Japan of Sony and Toyota, joining the military is a very
unfashionable career move and the jieitai has a harder and harder time
attracting recruits. It is about 30,000 soldiers below the level authorized by
Japanese policy, and there are relatively few people in the reserves.<p>

<p>

The army would be in terrible trouble if it were not for the southern island of
Kyushu, which contains only about an eighth of Japan's people but seems
(judging by the soldiers I've met) to produce most of its recruits. In Kyushu,
which has a long history of famous warrior clans, I have heard families say
that they wanted their sons to grow up to be soldiers or sailors, but not
anywhere else. Three years ago I interviewed cadets at the National Defense
Academy, in Yokosuka, where future officers are trained. I asked them why they
had chosen careers in the military. The ones who weren't from Kyushu often gave
answers like "failed my exams for Todai" (the hallowed University of Tokyo) and
"wanted a free education."<p>

<p>

There is an air of unseriousness about Japan's military undertakings, which is
especially noticeable by comparison with the deadly earnestness of everything
else. Soldiers are officially just another kind of government employee: there
is no court-martial system, no penalty for refusing to join the military after
getting a free education at the academy, no system of emergency laws empowering
the military to do what it must for national security. At the Japanese
air-force base in Okinawa an officer was giving me a lecture about the
supersensitive "hot scramble hangars," where F-4 fighters wait to intercept the
Soviet planes that fly close to Japanese air space every two or three days.
Just as he finished warning me not to get too close or take any pictures, an
All Nippon Airways jumbo jet taxied by, full of vacationers gawking out the
windows at the hangars. At Okinawa, as at the other major Japanese air-force
base--Chitose, on the northern island of Hokkaido--the air force has to share
runway space with, and be bossed around by, the civilian airlines. Political
"debates" about defense usually begin and end with statistics. "Discussions in
the Diet are always and only about the 'one percent limit,'" says Motoo Shiina,
one of the rare politicians known as an expert on defense. "You can sulk about
one percent for an hour, pro or con, but you shouldn't talk about anything
else."<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HERE are many explanations for Japan's nonchalance about the military. The
most obvious is Article IX of its postwar Constitution, drafted in English by
General Douglas MacArthur's occupation experts and translated into stilted
Japanese. Contrary to general belief in the United States, this "Peace
Constitution" does not set a ceiling on Japanese defense spending. The "limit"
of one percent was in fact merely a policy guideline adopted "for the time
being" by the Cabinet of Prime Minister Takeo Miki in 1976. Eleven years later,
under Yasuhiro Nakasone, Japan broke the limit when its spending reached 1.004
percent of GNP. The change was more significant than the tiny violation might
suggest. For one thing, Nakasone's government presented a Midterm Defense
Program, which outlined the new equipment the military would buy from 1986 to
1990. Such plans had existed before, but this was the first one backed up by
real money. The government committed 18 trillion yen (about $150 billion at
current rates) to be spent on the military over five years, at a time when most
domestic spending was being reduced. This should be enough to buy all the
weapons listed in the plan, and enough to keep defense spending slightly above
one percent of GNP. Also, this move was an attempt to move Japanese defense
discussions away from the one-percent obsession, so that budgets could be based
on what the military actually needed. In principle, the government now sets
budgets without worrying about the limit, but in practice, anything above one
percent creates intense political resistance in Japan.<p>

<p>

Rather than limiting defense spending, Article IX of the Constitution prohibits
it altogether--or so it seems, if the original English version is taken at face
value. "Land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never
be maintained," it says, because Japan "forever renounce[s]" resorting to armed
force as a sovereign right. Japan has worked its way toward its current sizable
military force through a series of judicial and political "reinterpretations"
of the Constitution. The crucial legal concept has been the idea that no nation
can renounce the right to defend itself against attack, much as no individual
is allowed to sell himself into slavery. Until 1950 MacArthur's policy
discouraged Japan from developing an armed force of any sort. But as American
soldiers were called away to Korea, MacArthur ordered Japan to establish a
National Police Reserve, comprising some 75,000 men, which later evolved into
the Ground Self-Defense Force.<p>

<p>

Some Japanese intellectuals contend that the half-serious, bastard nature of
the jieitai is spiritually bad for the country. Shuichi Kato, a renowned
leftist literary critic, was staunchly against the Vietnam War and is always
alert for signs of renascent militarism in Japan. But when I first met him, in
1986, he said, "And yet you cannot deny that Americans were risking their lives
in Vietnam for something they believed. Japan is not asked to do that now."
Hideaki Kase, from the opposite end of Japan's political spectrum, says
essentially the same thing. Kase, best known for his veneration of Japan's
imperial family, says, "We have been playing a very profitable game of posing
as unconscientious objectors. We base our defense policy not on preparation
against a hostile threat from the Russians but on the need to placate the
Americans." In contrast, Masataka Kosaka, a professor at Kyoto University who
is known as one of Japan's few "defense intellectuals," says that Japan's
military has a spiritual advantage over those of most other countries. In the
age of nuclear weapons, he says, fewer and fewer armies from major countries
will actually fight, and yet somehow they must maintain morale. Japan's army
has lived with this predicament for more than thirty years, he says, and it
will set the model for armies of the twenty-first century.<p>

<p>

Whether the hazy legality of the jieitai is good or bad for Japan, it indicates
Japan's lack of interest in expanding its military. Public-opinion polls in
Japan show overwhelming resistance to increases in defense spending. (In a
recent poll 80 percent of respondents favored keeping spending at or below the
current level of one percent.) Moreover, Japan's peculiar way of remembering
the Second World War intensifies the resistance to re-arming. Japan is not
exactly guilt-ridden about its role in the war--the Peace Memorial Museum, in
Hiroshima, for instance, begins its historical narrative with the American
firebombing of Tokyo in the spring of 1945, with no mention of any preceding
unpleasantness. But Japan seems unanimously and permanently convinced that the
war led to catastrophe for the country. Moreover, the prevalent view in Japan
is that the war was caused by a clique of semi-crazed militarists, who seized
control of the country and forced everyone else into what was clearly a
suicidal undertaking. This attitude is tremendously irritating to Chinese or
Koreans who are looking for signs of personal contrition from the Japanese, but
it actually makes for a very durable kind of anti-militarism--one based on
self-interest. "The war created lasting suspicion of the military, but not
because we made other people suffer," Shuichi Kato says. "The memory of the war
is that we suffered so much." Most mature Japanese can remember the utter ruin
of the postwar years; they blame General Tojo and his cronies for it, and they
don't want the military to have another chance.<p>

<p>

In the rest of Asia there is more of an edge to memories of Japan's wartime
role. As I've listened to officials--in China, especially--warn about the
danger of a militarized Japan, I've suspected that their fears were partly put
on for effect. Japan's war record is one of its few vulnerabilities, and these
warnings are a way to get America's attention. Still, I've heard the warnings
in every neighboring country (except Burma, where the Japanese are generally
viewed as liberators who kicked out the British), and for the most part the
apprehension seems sincere. Throughout Asia the least popular American trend is
the apparent enthusiasm for big Japanese defense spending. Lee Kuan Yew, the
Prime Minister of Singapore, has warned for years about the dangers of Japanese
re-armament, although recently he has started saying that a bigger Japanese
military is inevitable and that the crucial thing is for it to keep working as
a junior partner to the Americans. "As long as our military seems firmly under
the guidance of the Americans, the rest of Asia will not worry too much," says
Masashi Nishihara, a professor of international relations at the National
Defense Academy. "If we ever went off independently, everyone would be
afraid."<p>

<p>

In short, deeply felt emotions in Japan and throughout the rest of Asia put a
low ceiling on Japan's potential military spending. Long before the defense
budget increased enough to hobble the Japanese economy, it would have provoked
some political reaction from China and South Korea, and probably the Soviet
Union as well. (Exactly what kind of reaction is impossible to say, but it
certainly couldn't leave northeast Asia as free of major conflict as it has
been since the Korean Wan) But there is a further limit on Japan's spending: it
is hard to see what Japan could spend a lot of extra money for.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE question of "enough" is hard for any country considering its national
defense to resolve, but it is particularly baffling for Japan's military. In
theory, Japan could cut its military budget to zero and still feel more or less
secure, relying on the U.S. nuclear deterrent and on the knowledge that no one
has dared invade the home islands of Japan since the time of Kublai Khan. Or
Japan could equally well decide that its national-security interests extend to
every ship that brings in raw materials or carries out exports; in that case,
Japan would need to build the world's biggest navy to "defend" itself
completely.<p>

<p>

In practice, Japan has defined "enough" by taking on, one after another, jobs
that America has handed it during the past two decades. Its military now has
three main missions: to be ready to defend the northern island of Hokkaido
against a Russian assault; to be able to seal up the crucial straits of Soya,
Tsugaru, and Tsushima, through which the Soviet navy must pass to get from
Vladivostok to the open sea, and in general to erect air and sea defenses that
will keep the Soviet military bottled up in Siberia in time of war; and to
patrol the commercial shipping lanes leading southward from Japan toward the
Philippines and the Straits of Malacca. In principle, this means that Japan is
now completely responsible for defending itself with conventional weapons
against a conventional attack. The U.S. military's part of the bargain is to
provide a nuclear deterrent and, through the destroyers and aircraft carriers
of the Seventh Fleet, to do the kind of long-range "power projection" that no
Asians want the Japanese to undertake.<p>

<p>

Japan's assignments are somewhat vague and open-ended. For instance, the
responsibility for defending sea lanes, since 1981 mainly against Soviet
submarines, has included a thousand-mile stretch. But exactly how the Japanese
will divide this labor with the United States, and how much sea power they will
deploy, is unclear. What is clear is that Japan is well on its way to having a
big enough army to do its jobs, even at its current "free ride" budget levels.
Under the current Midterm Defense Program, Japan is supposed to increase its
force of F-15 fighters to 700, and modernize its 100 F-4s. It will replace its
older Nike anti-aircraft missiles with Patriot missiles, increase the number of
its P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from 50 to 100, and build 10 new
destroyer-type surface ships. Even during the Reagan-era military buildup the
U.S. inventory of most major weapons shrank, because the cost of weapons rose
faster than the budget. For the next few years Japan will be the only major
military power in the world that is buying new weapons and at the same time
expanding the size of its force. Japanese military officials often say that
their forces are small and humble, but most other defense authorities I've
interviewed here say that Japan has no urgent need for new hardware which
implementing the Midterm Defense Program won't meet.<p>

<p>

Japan's military still has some glaring weaknesses. According to U.S.
observers, it has never laid in adequate supplies of ammunition, fuel, or spare
parts. "They better hope the first volley holds off the Russians," an American
military officer says. "They've barely got one reload of missiles." Also, the
three branches of the Japanese military are even more uncoordinated and prone
to backbiting than the branches of America's are. When a Japan Air Lines jumbo
jet crashed in the mountains outside Tokyo in 1985, the rescuers reached the
site twelve hours late, in part because the air force, the army, various police
forces, and other government agencies were trying to decide who should do what
in the rescue effort. The survivors reported that several other people were
alive after the crash but died during the night, while the branches of the
jieitai spun their wheels. "This delay cost several lives," says Masataka
Kosaka, of Kyoto University. "In wartime such behavior would be
catastrophic."<p>

<p>

Despite such problems, many serious military analysts conclude that Japan is
smoothly moving toward "enough." Shunji Taoka, a veteran defense writer for
Japan's most prestigious newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, has prepared a dense
analysis showing that the Soviet Union lacks the troop carriers and transport
planes to overwhelm Japanese defenses during a surprise attack on Hokkaido.
Moreover, he says, the Soviet Far Eastern fleet is sure to weaken over the next
decade, because its ships are aging faster than they are being replaced. "Japan
exercises the responsibility for its own non-nuclear defense," Michael Armacost
told me shortly before he was nominated to succeed Mike Mansfield as the U.S.
ambassador to Japan. "Japan already possesses substantially more destroyers
than we deploy in the Seventh Fleet; it has a larger force of surveillance
aircraft than we maintain in the Pacific; it has nearly as many fighter
aircraft defending its territory as we have defending the continental United
States. This is a significant force and provides solid protection."<p>

<p>

Japan can undoubtedly go much further toward having "enough." One executive of
an American defense contractor, based in Tokyo, says that he has a vision of
"porcupine Japan," bristling with cruise missiles and electronic air-defense
systems that protect it against attack without threatening any of its
neighbors. Japan can also, and will, increase its foreign-aid payments, which
is a subject for another time. But--to get back to the main point--nothing in
Japan's internal politics, its relations with its neighbors, or its military
plans will make it spend enough money to weaken its economy as that of the
United States is now weakened.<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HAT leaves the other possibility--forcing Japan to shoulder some of America's
military costs. Americans imagine that they have tremendous leverage against
Japan on this point: Pay up or we'll leave you exposed. This, however, would be
an undignified position for America to take. Worse, it wouldn't work.<p>

<p>

As long as the United States remains a military power in the Pacific, it needs
Japan's cooperation at least as much as Japan needs U.S. protection. I mean
cooperation not in some abstract sense but as a practical matter of where the
United States can station its troops and dock its ships. In West Germany and
South Korea, American troops are stationed largely near the front, to guarantee
that they'd be involved if fighting began. But there is not a single United
States soldier in Hokkaido, the most likely invasion site in Japan (to the
extent that any site is likely). Of the 55,000 U.S. soldiers and sailors in
Japan, two thirds are based in Okinawa, a thousand miles southwest of Tokyo,
where they are mainly a swing force to be used in Korea or elsewhere in Asia.
The other major concentrations include a U.S. Air Force base in Misawa, in
northern Japan, the closest of all American bases to the imposing Soviet
military centers on Sakhalin Island; the naval base at Yokosuka, a crucial
dry-dock and refitting site for the U.S. Seventh Fleet; Army facilities at Zama
and a naval air installation at Atsugi, both near Tokyo; and a Marine air base
at Iwakuni, near Hiroshima. "We are not being honest...when we talk as though
American overseas military deployments have been essentially altruistic--not
for ourselves but for our allies," Martin Weinstein, of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, in Washington, D.C., said in congressional
testimony last fall. The real problem for America is not that it has to keep
bases in Japan but that it might lose them, according to Dennis J. Doolin, a
former Pentagon official who specialized in U.S.-Japanese relations. "We
are...in a logistically ideal strategic posture in Northeast Asia," Doolin has
written, "and we had better learn to appreciate this fact and stop
complaining....Japan's contribution is enormous, unique, irreplaceable, and
invaluable."<p>

<p>

Moreover, Japan already bears more of the cost of the American troops stationed
on its territory than does any other allied country. Its program of
"host-country support" covers about 40 percent of the roughly $6 billion cost
of keeping American soldiers there, and the Japanese-paid proportion is
increasing every year. (Japan says that under its Constitution and its-Status
of Forces Agreement with the United States it can't pay the salaries of
American soldiers or direct military operating costs, like those for fuel and
supplies. It is gradually taking over most other costs.) The presence of
foreign troops creates inevitable irritations: think how Americans would feel
if, instead of "buying up America" in some theoretical way, the Japanese had
soldiers in Chicago and aircraft carriers cruising through the Golden Gate. The
Japanese government goes out of its way to deflect resentment of the United
States. For instance, when some trees in a diminutive forest were cut down last
year to make way for new U.S. military housing, creating a huge controversy,
the Defense Agency made clear that Japan's government, not America's, had
authorized the project. Just about everything Japan can do for the American
military in Japan it is already doing or getting ready to do.<p>

<p>

The one big exception to Japan's generally cooperative approach
is--surprise--its weapons-buying policy. Each time Japan insists on
industrial-strategy projects like the FSX,--it feeds all the worst suspicions
about its sense of balance and fair play. But these disputes should be thought
of the way the Japanese think of them--as trade disputes, not military ones.
Japan could ease trade frictions, while getting twice as many weapons for its
money, if it bought planes and missiles directly from the United States, rather
than building them at home. But this will be one of the last areas Japan opens
to imports. Japanese officials are quite candid about their determination to
develop their own aircraft industry and in general to use military contracts
for industrial development. They are less candid about exports of military
equipment, which now occur on a small scale and could increase, because the
main barrier to them is not Japan's Constitution but its fear of international
reaction. Last summer the Tokyo office of Warburg Securities released an
influential report on Japan's nascent arms industries, including strong "buy,"
recommendations for major defense contractors such as Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, Japan Aircraft Manufacturing, and Fuji Heavy Industries.<p>

<p>

Where does this leave America? With little bargaining power to use over Japan
in military matters--and little reason to use it. Japan is happier for having
the United States as the big military power in the Pacific, so is the rest of
Asia, and so is the United States. Every strategic and military trend in the
area is favorable to American interests. There are no wars under way outside
Indochina; most countries are becoming richer, freer, and more democratic. The
only "threat" most Asian countries pose to the United States is through
economic competition. Much of what is right in Asia is right because of the
U.S. military presence, which has helped Japan to flourish peacefully and has
kept everyone else from worrying about Japan. It would be shortsighted to upset
this arrangement just to solve some trade problems. Trade problems are better
dealt with on their own.

	<font size=5>[T</font>he letters which have been selected for this number of the Atlantic were all
written during the last ten years of William James's life.<p>

<p>

In 1899 he went abroad. When he sailed he had no conception of the point of
exhaustion to which the previous years of unremitting work had brought him, and
he expected to spend a few months at a German watering-place and then write out
the lectures on 'Natural Religion,' which he had agreed to deliver on the
Gifford Foundation in Edinburgh. A heart-strain, due to overexertion in the
Adirondacks just before he sailed, brought on a general collapse as soon as he
was out of harness. The Gifford lectures were postponed until 1901 and 1902,
and James led the life of an exile and completely inactive invalid for two
years. To certain friends at home who wrote to him fully and often he was
touchingly grateful; and though he could do no work, he sometimes wrote, and
more often dictated to his wife, replies that were remarkably copious. The
first letter that follows was sent from Professor Charles Richet's
Ch&acirc;teau de Carqueiranne, near Hyeres on the south coast of France.
Professor Richet had put his country place at the disposal of William James and
of F. W. H. Myers, who also had been 'invalided south,' and for a few weeks the
two were together under the same hospitable roof.<p>

Francis Boott was nearly a generation older than James, and was spending his
last years in Cambridge. He was the subject of one of James's papers, which may
be found in Memories and Studies.]<p>

CARQUEIRANNE,<p>


Jan. 31, 1900.<p>

DEAR OLD FRIEND,--<p>

<p>

Every day for a month past I have said to Alice, 'Today we must get off a
letter to Mr. Boott'; but EVERY<i> </i>day the available strength was less than
the call upon it. Yours of the 28th December reached us duly at Rye and was
read at the cheerful little breakfast table. I must say that you are the only
person who has caught the proper tone for sympathizing with an invalid's
feelings. Everyone else says, 'We are glad to think that you are by this time
in splendid condition, richly enjoying your rest, and having a great success at
Edinburgh'--this when what one craves is mere pity for one's unmerited
sufferings! YOU say, 'It is a great disappointment, more I should think than
you can well bear. I wish you could give up the whole affair and turn your prow
toward home.' That, dear sir, is the proper note to strike, 'La voix du coeur
qui seul au coeur arrive'; and I thank you for recognizing that it is a case of
agony and patience. I, for one, should be too glad to turn my prow homewards,
in spite of all our present privileges in the way of simplified life and
glorious climate.<p>

<p>

What would n't I give at this moment to be partaking of one of your recherches
dejeuners a la fourchette, ministered to by the good Kate. From the bed on
which I lie I can 'sense' it as if present--the succulent roast pork, the apple
sauce, the canned asparagus, the cranberry pie, the dates, the To Kalon*--above
all the rire en barbe of the ever-youthful host. Will they ever come again?<p>

<p>

Don't understand me to be disparaging our present meals, which, cooked by a
broad-built sexagenarian Proven&ccedil;ale, leave nothing to be desired.
Especially is the fish good, and the artichokes, and the stewed lettuce. Our
commensaux, the Myerses, form a good combination. The house is vast and
comfortable and the air just right for one in my condition, neither relaxing
nor exciting, and floods of sunshine.<p>

<p>

Do you care much about the war? For my part, I think Jehovah has run the thing
about right, so far, though on utilitarian grounds it will be very likely
better if the English win. When we were at Rye an interminable controversy
raged about a national day of humiliation and prayer. I wrote to the Times to
suggest, in my character of traveling American, that both sides to the
controversy might be satisfied by a service arranged on the principle suggested
by the anecdote of the Montana settler who met a grizzly so formidable that he
fell on his knees, saying, 'O Lord, I hain't never asked ye for help and ain't
a-going to ask ye for none now. But for pity's sakes O Lord, don't help the
bear.' The solemn Times  never printed my letter, and thus the world lost an
admirable epigram. You, I know, will appreciate it.<p>

<p>

I hope you are getting through the winter without any bronchial trouble, and I
hope that neither the influenza nor the bubonic plague have got to Cambridge
yet. The former is devastating Europe. If you see dear Dr. Driver, give him our
warmest regards. One ought to stay among one's own people. I seem to be
mending, though very slowly, and the least thing knocks me down. This noon I am
still in bed; a little too much talking with Myers yesterday giving me a strong
pectoral distress which is not yet over. This dictation begins to hurt me, so I
will stop. My spirits now are first-rate, which is a great point gained.<p>

<p>

GLORIOUS OLD PALMER,--<p>

<p>

I had come to the point of feeling that my next letter MUST be to you, when in
comes your delightful 'favor' of the 18th, with all its news, its convincing
clippings and its enclosures from Bakewell and Sheldon. I have had many
impulses to write to Bakewell, but they have all aborted--my powers being so
small and so much in Anspruch genommen by correspondence already under way. I
judge him to be well and happy. What think you of his wife? I suppose she is no
relation of yours. I should n't think any of your three candidates would do for
that conventional Bryn Mawr. She stoneth the prophets, and I wish she would get
X------ and get stung. He made a deplorable impression on me many years ago.
The only comment I heard when I gave my address there lately (the last one in
my 'Talks') was that ---- had hoped for something more technical and
psychological! Nevertheless, some good girls seem to come out at Bryn Mawr. I
am awfully sorry that Perry is out of place. Unless he gets something good, it
seems to me that we ought to get him for a course in Kant. He is certainly the
soundest, most normal all-round man of our recent production.<p>

<p>

Your list for next year interests me muchly. I am glad of Munsterberg's and
Santayana's new courses, and hope they'll be good. I'm glad you're back in
Ethics, and glad that Royce has<p>

'Epistemology'--portentous name, and small result, in my opinion, but a
substantive DISCIPLINE which ought, par le temps qui court, to be treated with
due formality. I look forward with eagerness to his new volume.* What a
colossal feat he has performed in these two years--all thrown in by the way, as
it were. Certainly Gifford lectures are a good institution for stimulating
production. They have stimulated me so far to produce two lectures of
wishy-washy generalities. What is that for a 'showing' in six months of
absolute leisure? The second lecture used me up so that I must be off a good
while again. No! dear Palmer, the best I can possibly hope for at Cambridge
after my return is to be able to carry one half-course. So make all
calculations accordingly. As for Windelband, how can I ascertain anything
except by writing to him? I shall see no one, nor go to any University
environment. My impression is that we must go in for budding genius, if we seek
a European. If an American, we can get a sommite. But who? in either case?
Verily there is room at the top. Z--- seems to be the only Britisher worth
thinking of. I imagine we had better train up our own men. A---, B---, C---,
either would no doubt do, especially A--- if his health improves. D--- is our
last card, from the point of view of policy, no doubt, but from that of inner
organization it seems to me that he may have too many points of coalescence
with both M&uuml;nsterberg and Royce, especially the latter.<p>

<p>

The great event in my life recently has been the reading of Santayana's book
[Poetry and Religion] Although I absolutely reject the platonism of it, I have
literally squealed with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the
position is laid down on page after page; and grunted with delight at such a
thickening up of our Harvard atmosphere. If our students now could begin really
to understand what Royce means with his voluntaristic-pluralistic monism, what
Munsterberg means with his dualistic scientificism and platonism, what
Santayana means by his pessimistic platonism (I wonder if he and Mg. have had
any close mutually-encouraging intercourse in this line?), what I mean by my
crass pluralism, what you mean by your ethical idealism, that these are so many
religions, ways of fronting life, and worth fighting for, we should have a
genuine philosophic universe at Harvard. The best condition of it would be an
open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems. (Alas! that I should be out
of it, just as my chance begins!) The world might ring with the struggle, if we
devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other.<p>

<p>

I now understand Santayana, the man. I never understood him before. But what a
perfection of rottenness in a philosophy! I don't think I ever knew the
anti-realistic view to be propounded with so impudently superior an air. It is
refreshing to see a representative of moribund Latinity rise up and administer
such reproof to us barbarians in the hour of our triumph. I imagine Santayana's
style to be entirely spontaneous. But it has curious classic echoes. Whole
pages of pure Hume in style; others of pure Renan. Nevertheless, how fantastic
a philosophy!--as if the 'world of values' WERE independent of existence. It is
only as BEING, that one thing is better than another. The idea of darkness is
as good as that of light, as ideas. There is more value in light's BEING. And
the exquisite consolation, when you have ascertained the badness of all fact,
in knowing that badness is inferior to goodness, to the end--it only rubs the
pessimism in. A man whose eggs at breakfast turn out always bad, says to
himself, 'Well, bad and good are not the same, anyhow.' That is just the
trouble! Moreover, when you come down to the facts, what do your harmonious and
integral ideal systems prove to be? in the concrete? Always things burst by the
growing content of experience. Dramatic unities; laws of versification;
ecclesiastical systems; scholastic doctrines. Bah! Give me Walt Whitman and
Browning ten times over, much as the perverse ugliness of the latter at times
irritates me, and intensely as I have enjoyed Santayana's attack. The
barbarians are in the line of mental growth and those who do insist that the
ideal and the real are dynamically continuous are those by whom the world is to
be saved. But I'm nevertheless delighted that the other view, always existing
in the world, should at last have found so splendidly impertinent an expression
among ourselves. I have meant to write to Santayana; but on second thoughts,
and to save myself, I will just ask you to send him this. It saves him from
what might be the nuisance of having to reply, and on my part it has the
advantage of being more freespoken and direct. He is certainly an
extraordinarily distingue writer. Thank him for existing!<p>

<p>

As a contrast, read Jack Chaoman's 'Practical Agitation.' The other pole of
thought, and a style all splinters-- but a gospel for our rising generation-- I
hope it will have its effect.<p>

<p>

Send me your Noble lectures. I don't see how you could risk it without a MS. If
you did fail (which I doubt) you deserved to. Anyhow, the printed page makes
everything good.<p>

<p>

I CAN no more! Adieu! How is Mrs. Palmer this winter? I hope entirely herself
again. You are impartially silent of her and of my wife! The Transcript
continues to bless us. We move from this hospitable roof to the hotel at
Costebelle to-day. Thence after a fortnight to Geneva, and in May to Nauheim
once more, to be reexamined and sentenced by Schott.<p>

BELOVED ROYCE,--<p>

<p>

Great was my, was OUR pleasure receiving your long and delightful letter last
night. Like the lioness Aesop's fable, you give birth to one young one only in
the year, but that one is a lion. I give birth mainly to guinea-pigs in the
shape of postcards; but despite such diversities of epistolary expression, the
heart of each of us is in the right place. I need not say, my dear old boy, how
touched I am at your expressions of affection or how it pleases me to hear that
you have missed me. I too miss you profoundly. I do not find in the hotel
waiters, chambermaids and bath-attendants, with whom my lot is chiefly cast,
that unique mixture of erudition, originality, profundity<p>

and vastness, and human wit and leisureliness, by accustoming me to which
during all these years you have spoilt me for inferior kinds of intercourse.
You are still the centre of my gaze, the pole of my mental magnet. When I
write, 't is with one eye on the page and one on you. When I compose my Gifford
lectures mentally, 't is with the design exclusively of overthrowing your
system, and ruining your peace. I lead a parasitic life upon you, for my
highest flight of ambitious ideality is to become your conqueror, and go down
into history as such, you and I rolled in one another's arms and silent (or
rather loquacious still) in one death-grapple of an embrace. How then, O my
dear Royce, can I forget you, or be contented out of your close neighborhood?
Different as our minds are, yours has nourished mine, as no other social
influence ever has, and in converse with you I have always felt that my life
was being lived importantly. Our minds, too, are not different in the OBJECT
which they envisage. It is the whole paradoxical physico-moral-spiritual
Fatness, of which most people single out some skinny fragment, which we both
cover with our eye. We 'aim at him generally'--and most others don't. I don't
believe that we shall dwell apart forever, though our formulas may.<p>

<p>

Home and Irving Street look very near when seen through these few winter
months, and though it is still doubtful what I may be able to do in college,
for social purposes I shall be available for probably numerous years to come. I
have n't got at work yet,--only four lectures of the first course written
(strange to say),--but I am decidedly better to-day than I have been for the
past ten months, and the matter is all ready in my mind, so that when, a month
hence, I get settled down in Rome, I think the rest will go off fairly quickly.
The second course I shall have to resign from, and write it out at home as a
book. It must seem strange to you that the way from the mind to the pen should
be as intraversable as it has been in this case of mine--you in whom it always
seems so easily pervious. But Miller will be able to tell you all about my
condition, both mental and physical, so I will waste no more words on that to
me decidedly musty subject.<p>

<p>

I fully understand your great aversion to letters and other off-writing. You
have done a perfectly Herculean amount of the most difficult productive work,
and I believe you to be much more tired than you probably yourself suppose or
know--both mentally and physically. I imagine that a long vacation, in other
scenes, with no sense of duty, would do you a world of good. I don't say the
full fifteen months, for I imagine that one summer and one academic half-year
would perhaps do the business better. You could preserve the relaxed and
desultory condition as long as that probably, whilst later you 'd begin to
chafe; and THEN you'd better be back in your own library. If MY continuing
abroad is hindering this, my sorrow will be extreme. Of course I must some time
come to a definite decision about my own relations to the College, but I am
reserving that till the end of 1900, when I shall write to Eliot in full. There
is still a therapeutic card to play, of which I will say nothing just now, and
I don't want to commit myself before that has been tried.<p>

<p>

You say nothing of the second course of Aberdeen lectures, nor do you speak at
all of the Dublin course. Strange omissions, like your not sending me your
Ingersoll Lecture! I assume that the publication of [your] Gifford vol. II will
not be very long delayed. I am eager to read them. I can read philosophy now,
and have just read the first three Lieferungen of K. Fischer's Hegel. I must
say I prefer the original text. Fischer's paraphrases always flatten and dry
things out; and he gives no rich sauce of his own to compensate. I have been
sorry to hear from Palmer that he also has been very tired. One can't keep
going forever! P. has been like an archangel in his letters to me, and I am
inexpressively grateful. Well! everybody has been kinder than I deserve.<p>

supplied James with references to many books that had interested him while he
was preparing for the Gifford Lectures. The next letter is addressed to the

in Edinburgh. It will be recalled that these lectures appeared in book form as

1901.<p>

DEAR MR. RANKIN--<p>

<p>

. . . You have been so extraordinarily brotherly to me in writing of your
convictions and in furnishing me ideas, that I feel ashamed of my churlish and
chary replies. You, however, have forgiven me. Now, at the end of this first
course, I feel my 'matter' taking firmer shape, and it will please you less to
hear me say that I believe myself to be (probably) permanently incapable of
believing the Christian scheme of vicarious salvation, and wedded to a more
continuously evolutionary mode of thought. The reasons you from time to time
have given me, never better expressed than in your letter before the last, have
somehow failed to convince. In these lectures the ground I am taking is this:
The mother-sea and fountain-head of all religions lies in the mystical
experiences of the individual, taking the word mystical in a very wide sense.
All theologies and all ecclesiasticisms are secondary growths superimposed; and
the experiences make such flexible combinations with the INTELLECTUAL
prepossessions of their subjects, that one may almost say that they have no
proper intellectual deliverance of their own, but belong to a region deeper,
and more vital and practical, than that which the intellect inhabits. For this
they are also indestructible by intellectual arguments and criticisms. I attach
the mystical or religious consciousness to the possession of an extended
subliminal self, with a thin partition through which messages make irruption.
We are thus made convincingly aware of the presence of a sphere of life larger
and more powerful than our usual consciousness, with which the latter is
nevertheless continuous. The impressions and impulsions and emotions and
excitements which we thence receive help us to live; they found invincible
assurance of a world beyond the sense; they melt our hearts and communicate
significance and value to everything and make us happy. They do this for the
individual who has them, and other individuals follow him. Religion this way is
absolutely indestructible. Philosophy and theology give their conceptual
interpretations of this experiential life. The farther margin of the subliminal
field being unknown, it can be treated, as by Transcendental Idealism, as an
Absolute mind with a part of which we coalesce, or by Christian theology, as a
distinct deity acting on us. Something not our immediate self DOES<i> </i>act
on our life! So I seem doubtless to my audience to be blowing hot and cold,
explaining away Christianity, yet defending the more general basis from which I
say it proceeds. I fear that these brief words may be misleading, but let them
go! When the book comes out you will get a truer idea. Believe me, with
profound regard, <p>

                                   Yours always truly,<p>

                                            WM. JAMES.<p>

1902.<p>

DEAR HENRY--<p>

<p>

I am emboldened to the step I am taking by the consciousness that though we are
both at least sixty years old and have known each other from the cradle, I have
never but once (or possibly twice) traded on your well-known lavishness of
disposition to swell any 'subscription' which I was trying to raise.<p>

<p>

Now the doomful hour has struck. The altar is ready, and I take the victim by
the ear. I choose you for a victim because you still have some undesiccated
human feeling about you and can think in terms of pure charity--for the love of
God, without ulterior hopes of returns from the investment. <p>

<p>

The subject is a man of fifty, who can be recommended to no other kind of a
benefactor. His story is a long one, but it amounts to this, that Heaven made
him with no other power than of thinking and writing, and he has proved by this
time a truly pathological inability to keep body and soul together. He is
abstemious to an incredible degree, is the most innocent and harmless of human
beings, isn't propagating his kind, has never had a dime to spend except for
vital necessities, and never has had in his life an hour of what such as WE
call freedom from care, or of 'pleasure' in the ordinary, exuberant sense of
the term. He is refinement itself mentally and morally; and his writings have
all been printed in first-rate periodicals, but are too scanty to 'pay.'
There's no excuse for him, I admit. But God made him; and after kicking and
cuffing and prodding him for twenty years, I have now come to believe that he
ought to be treated in charity pure and simple (even though that be a vice),
and I want to guarantee him $350 a year as a pension to be paid to the Mills
Hotel in Bleecker Street, New York, for board and lodging and a few cents
weekly over and above. I will put in $150. I have secured $100 more. Can I
squeeze $50 a year out of you for such a non-public cause? If not, don't reply
and forget this letter. If 'ja,' and you think you really can afford it, and it
is n't wicked, let me know, and I will dun you regularly every year for the
$50.<p>

<p>

                                                 Yours as ever,<p>

                                                    WM. JAMES.<p>

<p>

It is a great compliment that I address you. Most men say of such a case, 'Is
the man deserving?' Whereas the real point is 'Does he need us?' What is
'deserving' nowadays?<p>

<p>

[After delivering the last Gifford Lectures James had returned to Cambridge,
with the resolution to devote his remaining years to the formulation of his
philosophy. His working powers has been permanently impaired. He had passed his
sixtieth birthday. But the writing and correspondence in which he engaged
between 1902 and 1910 were none the less marked by a truly youthful enthusiasm
and elan. He gradually freed himself from college duties, and, in the full
consciousness of his ample preparation and ripened judgment, turned to the
philosophic questions which had always been most fascinating to his
imagination. The discussion that was aroused by his pragmatism, by his later
papers on pluralism and radical empiricism, and by his definition of truth,
excited him; and he threw himself into controversy in a spirit that somehow
combined the rough exuberance of a boy at play with a mellow good-nature that
was of the essence of his own mature genius.]<p>

 DEAR FLOURNOY,--<p>

<p>

Your dilectissime [sic] letter of the l6th arrived this morning and I must
scribble a word of reply. That 's the way to write to a man! Caress him!
flatter him! tell him that all Switzerland is hanging on his lips! You have
made me really HAPPY for at least twenty-four hours. My dry and businesslike
compatriots never write letters like that. They write about themselves--you
write about ME. You know the definition of an egotist: 'a person who insists on
talking about HIMSELF when you want to talk about YOURSELF.<p>

<p>

Reverdin has told me of the success of your lectures on pragmatism, and if you
have been communing in spirit with me this winter, so have I with you. I have
grown more and more deeply into pragmatism, and I rejoice immensely to hear you
say, 'Je m'y sens tout gagne.' It is absolutely the only philosophy with NO
humbug in it, and I am certain that it is YOUR<i> </i>philosophy. Have you read
Papini's article in the February Leonardo? That seems to me really splendid.
You say that my ideas have formed the real centre de ralliment of the
pragmatist tendencies. To me it is the youthful and empanache<i>--</i>, who has
best put himself at the centre of equilibrium when all the motor tendencies
start. He (and Schiller) has given me great confidence and courage. I shall
dedicate my book, however, to the memory of J. S. Mill.<p>

<p>

I hope that you are careful to distinguish in my own work between pragmatism
and the 'radical empiricism' ('Conception de Conscience,' etc.*) which to my
own mind have no necessary connexion with each other. My first proofs came in
this morning, along with your letter, and the little book ought to be out by
the first of June. You shall have a very early copy. It is exceedingly
untechnical, and I can't help suspecting that it will make a real impression.
Munsterberg, who hitherto has been rather pooh-poohing my thought, now, after
reading the lecture on truth which I sent you a while ago, says, I seem to be
ignorant that Kant ever wrote, Kant having already said all that I say. I
regard this as a very good symptom. The third stage of opinion about a new
idea, already arrived: 1st: absurd! 2nd: trivial! 3rd: WE discovered it! I
don't suppose you mean to print these lectures of yours but I wish you would.
If you would translate my lectures, what could make me happier? But, as I said
apropos of the Varieties, I hate to think of you doing that drudgery when you
might be formulating your own ideas. But, in one way or the other, I hope you
will join in the great strategic combination against the forces of rationalism
and bad abstractionism! A good coup de collier all round, and I verily believe
that a new philosophic movement will begin ! . . . <p>

<p>

I thank you for your congratulations on my retirement. It makes me very happy.
A professor has two functions: (1) to be learned and distribute bibliographic
information; (2) to communicate truth. The first function is the essential one,
officially considered. The second is the only one I care for. Hitherto I have
always felt like a humbug as a professor, for I am weak in the first
requirement. Now I can live for the second with a free conscience.<p>

<p>

I envy you now at the Italian Lakes! But good-bye! I have already written you a
long letter, though I only MEANT to write a line! <p>

O MY BERGSON--<p>

<p>

You are a magician, and your book is a marvel, a real wonder in the history of
philosophy, making, if I mistake not, an entirely new era in respect of matter,
but unlike the works of genius of the 'transcendentalist' movement (which are
so obscurely and abominably and inaccessibly written), a pure classic in point
of form. You may be amused at comparison, but in finishing it I found the same
after-taste remaining as after finishing Madame Bovary; such a flavor of
persistent euphony, as of a river that never foamed or ran thin, but steadily
and firmly proceeded with banks full to the brim. Then the aptness of your
illustrations, that never scratch or stand out at right angles, but invariably
simplify the thought and help to pour it along! Oh, indeed you are a magician!
And if your next book proves to be as great an advance on this one as this is
on its two predecessors, your name will surely go down as one of great creative
names in philosophy.<p>

<p>

There! have I praised you enough? What every genuine philosopher (every genuine
man, in fact) craves most is PRAISE--although the philosophers generally call
it 'recognition'! If you want still more praise, let me know, and I will send
it, for my features have been on a broad smile from the first page to the last,
at the chain of felicities that never stopped. I feel rejuvenated.<p>

<p>

As to the content of it, I am not in a mood at present to make any definite
reaction. There is so much that is absolutely new that it will take a long time
for your contemporaries to assimilate it, and I imagine that much of the
development of detail will have to be performed by younger men whom your ideas
will stimulate to coruscate in manners unexpected by yourself. To me at present
the vital achievement of the book is that it inflicts an irrecoverable death
wound upon Intellectualism. It can never resuscitate! But it will die hard, for
all the inertia of the past is in it, and the spirit of professionalism and
pedantry as well as the aesthetic-intellectual delight of dealing with
categories logically distinct yet logically connected, will rally for a
desperate defense. The elan vital, all contentless and vague as you are obliged
to leave it, will be an easy substitute to make fun of. But the Beast HAS its
death wound now, and the manner in which you have inflicted it (interval versus
temps d'arret, etc.) is masterly in the extreme.<p>

<p>

I don't know why this later redaction of your critique of the mathematics of
movement has seemed to me so much more telling than the early statement--I
suppose it is because of the wider USE made of the principle in the book.<p>

You will be receiving my own little 'Pragmatism' book simultaneously with this
letter. How jejune and inconsiderable it seems in comparison with your great
system! But it is so congruent with parts of your system, fits so well into
interstices thereof, that you will easily understand why I am so enthusiastic.
I feel that at bottom we are fighting the same fight, you a commander, I in the
ranks. The position we are rescuing is 'Tychism' and a really growing world.
But whereas I have hitherto found no better way of defending Tychism than by
affirming the spontaneous addition of discrete elements of being (or their
subtraction), thereby playing the game with intellectualist weapons, you set
things straight at a single stroke by your fundamental conception of the
continuously creative nature of reality. I think that one of your happiest
strokes is your reduction of 'finality,' as usually taken, to its status
alongside of efficient causality as the twin daughters of intellectualism. But
this vaguer and truer finality restored to its rights will be a difficult thing
to give content to. Altogether your reality lurks so in the background in this
book, that I am wondering whether you COULD N'T<i> </i>give it any more
development in concreto here, or whether you perhaps were holding back
developments, already in your possession, for a future volume. They are sure to
come to you later anyhow, and to make a new volume; and altogether, the clash
of these ideas of yours with the traditional ones will be sure to make sparks
fly that will illuminate all sorts of dark places and bring innumerable new
considerations into view. But the process may be slow, for the ideas are so
revolutionary. Were it not for your style, your book might last 100 years
unnoticed; but your way of writing is so absolutely commanding, that your
theories have to be attended to immediately.<p>

<p>

I feel very much in the dark still about the relations of the progressive to
the regressive movement, and this great precipitate of nature subject to static
categories. With a frank pluralism of BEINGS endowed with vital impulses, you
can get oppositions and compromises easily enough, and a stagnant deposit; but,
after my one reading, I don't exactly 'catch on' to the way in which the
continuum of reality resists itself so as to have to act, etc., etc. The only
part of the work which I felt like positively criticising was the discussion of
the idea of nonentity, which seemed to me somewhat over-elaborated, and yet did
n't leave me with a sense that the last word had been said on the subject.<p>

<p>

But all these things must be very slowly digested by me. I can see that when
the tide turns in your favor, many previous tendencies in philosophy will start
up, crying, "This is nothing but what WE have contended for all along.'
Schopenhauer's blind will, Hartmann's unconscious, Fichte's aboriginal freedom
(reedited at Harvard in the most 'unreal' possible way by Munsterberg) will all
be claimants for priority. But no matter--all the better if you are in some
ancient lines of tendency. Mysticism also must make claims and doubtless, just
ones. I say nothing more now--this is just my first reaction; but I am so
enthusiastic as to have said only two days ago, 'I thank Heaven that I have
lived to this date--I have witnessed the Russo-Japanese War, and seen Bergson's
new book appear--the two great modern turning points, of history and of
thought!'<p>

I have two letters from you--one about...Harris on Shakespeare. Re Harris, I
did think you were a bit supercilious a priori; but I thought of youth and
excused you. Harris himself is horrid young and crude. Much of his talk seems
to me absurd, but  nevertheless that 's the way to write about Shakespeare; and
I am sure that, if Shakespeare were a Piper-control, he would say that he
relished Harris far more than the pack of reverent commentators who treat him
as a classic moralist. He seems to me to have been a professional AMUSER, in
the first instance, with a productivity like that of a Dumas; or a Scribe; but
possessing what no other amuser has possessed, a lyric splendor added to his
rhetorical fluency, which has made people take him for a more essentially
serious human being than he was. Neurotically and erotically, he was
hyperaesthetic, with a playful graciousness of character never surpassed. He
could be profoundly melancholy; but even then was controlled by the audience's
needs. A cork in the rapids, with no ballast of his own, without religious or
ethical ideals, accepting uncritically every theatrical and social convention,
he was simply an aeolian harp passively resounding to the stage's call. Was
there ever an author of such emotional importance whose reaction against the
false conventions of life was such an absolute zero as his? I know nothing of
the other Elizabethans, but could they have been as soulless in this
respect?--But<i> </i>halte-la! or I shall become a Harris myself! . . . Ever

DEAR HENRY ADAMS,--<p>

<p>

I have been so 'slim' since seeing you, and the baths here have so weakened my
brain, that I have been unable to do any reading except trash, and have only
just got round to finishing your Letter which I had but half-read when I was
with you at Paris. To tell the truth, it does n't impress me at all, save by
its wit and erudition; and I ask you whether an old man soon about to meet his
Maker can hope to save himself from the consequences of his life by pointing to
the wit and learning he has shown in treating a tragic subject. No, sir, you
can't do it--can't impress God in that way.<p>

<p>

So far as our scientific conceptions go, it may be admitted that your Creator
(and mine) started the universe with a certain amount of 'energy' latent in it,
and decreed that everything that should happen thereafter should be a result of
parts of that energy falling to lower levels; raising other parts higher, to be
sure, in so doing, but never in equivalent amount, owing to the constant
radiation of unrecoverable warmth incidental to the process. It is customary
for gentlemen to pretend to believe one another, and until some one hits upon a
newer evolutionary concept (which may be to-morrow), all physicists must play
the game by holding religiously to the above doctrine. It involves of course
the ultimate cessation of all perceptible happening, and the end of human
history. With this general conception as SURROUNDING everything, you say in
your Letter, no one can find any fault--in the present stage of scientific
conventions and fashions. But I protest against your interpretation of some of
the specifications of the great statistical drift downwards of the original
high level energy. If, instead of criticising what you seem to say, I express
my own interpretation dogmatically, and leave you to make the comparison, it
will doubtless conduce to brevity and economize recrimination.<p>

<p>

To begin with, the AMOUNT of cosmic energy it costs to buy a certain
distribution of fact which humanly we regard as precious seems to be an
altogether secondary matter as regards the question of history and progress.
Certain arrangements of matter on THE SAME ENERGY-LEVEL<i> </i>are, from the
point of view of man's appreciation, superior, while others are inferior.
Physically a dinosaur's brain may show as much intensity of energy exchange as
a man's; but it can do infinitely fewer things, because as a force of detent it
can only unlock the dinosaur's muscles, while the man's brain, by unlocking far
feebler muscles, indirectly can by their means issue proclamations, write
books, describe Chartres Cathedral, etc., and guide the energies of the
shrinking sun into channels which never would have been entered otherwise--in
short, make history. Therefore the man's brain and muscles are, from the point
of view of the historian, the more important place of energy exchange, small as
this may be, when measured in absolute physical units.<p>

<p>

The 'second law' is wholly irrelevant to 'history,' save that it sets a
terminus; for history is the course of things before that terminus, and all
that the second law says is that, whatever the history, it must insert itself
between that initial maximum and that terminal minimum of difference in energy
level. As the great irrigation-reservoir empties itself, the whole question for
US<i> </i>is that of the distribution of its effects--of WHICH<i> </i>rills to
guide it into; and the size of the rills has nothing to do with their
significance. Human cerebration is the most important rill we know of, and both
the 'capacity' and the 'intensity' factor thereof may be treated as
infinitesimal. Yet the filling of such rills would be cheaply bought by the
waste of whole sums spent in getting a little of the down-flowing torrent to
enter them. Just so of human institutions; their value has in strict theory
nothing whatever to do with their energy-budget-- being wholly a question of
the form the energy flows through. Though the ULTIMATE<i> </i>state of the
universe may be its vital and psychical extinction, there is nothing in physics
to interfere with the hypothesis that the PENULTIMATE  state might be the
millennium-- in other words a state in which a minimum of difference of
energy-level might have its exchanges so skillfully canalises that a maximum of
happy and virtuous consciousness would be the only result. In short, the last
expiring pulsation of the universe's life might be, 'I am so happy and perfect
that I can stand it no longer.' You don't believe this and I don't say I do.
But I can find nothing in 'Energetik' to conflict with its possibility. You
seem to me not to discriminate, but to treat quantity and distribution of
energy as if they formed a single question.<p>

<p>

There! that 's pretty good for a brain after eighteen Nauheim baths--so I won't
write another line, nor ask you to reply to me. In case you can't help doing
so, however, I will gratify you now by saying that I probably won't jaw back.
It was pleasant at Paris to hear your identically unchanged and 'undegraded'
voice after so many years of loss of solar energy.<p>

                                            Yours ever truly,<p>

                                                 WM. JAMES.<p>

19,1910.<p>

P.S. Another illustration of my meaning. The clock of the universe is running
down, and by so doing makes the hands move. The energy absorbed by hands, and
the MECHANICAL<i> </i>work they do, is the same day after day, no matter how
far the weights have descended from the position they were originally wound up
to. The HISTORY<i> </i>which the hands perpetrate has nothing to do with the
QUANTITY  of this work, but follows the significance of the figures which they
cover on the dial. If they move from O to XII, there is 'progress'; if from XII
to O there is  decay,' etc. etc.                                W. J. <p>

1910.<p>

Yours of the 20th, just arriving, pleases me by its docility of spirit and
passive subjection to philosophic opinion. Never, never pretend to an opinion
of your own! that way lies every arrogance and madness! You tempt me to offer
you another illustration--that of the HYDRAULIC RAM<i> </i>(thrown back to me
in an exam as a 'hydraulic goat' by an insufficiently intelligent student). Let
this arrangement of metal, placed in the course of a brook, symbolize the
machine of human life. It works, clap, clap, clap, day and night, so long as
the brook runs AT ALL, and no matter how full the brook (which symbolizes the
descending cosmic energy) may be; and it works always to the same effect, of
raising so many kilogrammeters of water. What the VALUE of this work as history
may be depends on the uses to which the water is put in the house which the ram
serves.

	<font size=5>P</font>ETER G. Peterson, a New York investment banker and the
founding president of the <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/concord/cc_home.html">Concord Coalition</A>, a citizens' group co-chaired by
the former senators Warren Rudman and Paul Tsongas, which one might say is
dedicated to making America eat its collective spinach, may be the author of
our cover article, but Peterson's father, George, who died in 1986, is its
inspiration. George and his wife, Venetia, gave their son life lessons that
inform his public commitments. These lessons echo in every line of his two
books and several major articles; the best-known among the latter, <A 
HREF="../../../election/connection/Budget/afterf.htm">"The Morning
After,"</A> which appeared in the October, 1987, issue of <i>The Atlantic
Monthly</i>, unmasked the fiscal disaster of supply-side economics and won a
National Magazine Award.<p>

George Petropoulos and Venetia Papapavlou were Greek immigrants who came to
this country as teenagers; George joined his older brother Nick as a dishwasher
in the caboose kitchens of the Union Pacific Railroad. In time he put by enough
money to start "the inevitable Greek restaurant"--as Peterson writes in his
1993 book <i><A HREF="../../../election/connection/Budget/facingf.htm">Facing Up </A></i>--in Kearny, Nebraska, a stop on the Union Pacific.
Its doors were open twenty-four hours a day 365 days a year.<p>

The Petersons (Nick took the name after his foreman repeatedly mangled
"Petropoulos,"and George adopted it) lived by an endowment ethic: A better
future requires investment, which requires saving, which requires sacrifices in
present consumption. That is Pete Peterson's prescription for America today. <p>

"Right now," he writes, "a huge crop of Baby Boom workers are swelling our tax
receipts while a relatively small generation retires. But soon those
demographic forces will be thrown into reverse." The long gray wave of the Baby
Boom generation's retirement will crowd out investment, both private and
public, physical and human--unless we act <i>now</i> to balance the budget,
require families to save more for their future, and enact far-reaching reforms
in senior entitlements like Social Security and Medicare. Peterson served on
the <A HREF="http://www.thirdmil.org/archive/lib1.html">President's Commission on Entitlement Reform</A> in 1994. His views have
weight. We asked him, Is entitlement reform likely to be debated in the
presidential campaign? On this issue, Peterson says, the candidates are either
being "constructively ambiguous" or are taking "a deafening oath of 
silence."<p>

<blockquote>
	<center><i><font size=4>Unlike nearly everyone in Japan and the rest of Asia, Americans want Japan to
spend more on its military, thinking that will equalize economic competition.
It won't.</i></font></center><p>
	
	
	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	
	<font size=5>A</font>merica's biggest delusion about Japan is that the "free ride" on defense that
we give Japan is the key to the two countries' problems. If we can only make
the Japanese pay for their own protection, many Americans feel, our economic
difficulties will work themselves out.<p>

<p>

Last fall, before he was nominated as Secretary of Defense, John Tower told a
Japanese interviewer what he later said during his confirmation hearings: that
Japan should change its Constitution if that's what it would take to start
spending more on defense. In its past session the U.S. Congress passed a
resolution demanding that Japan spend three percent of its gross national
product on defense, as opposed to the roughly one percent it spends now (and to
the seven percent the United States spends). "Our European partners spend about
three percent," an aide to Representative Duncan Hunter, of California, who
sponsored the resolution, said early this year. "It's entirely reasonable to
expect Japan to do the same." Last year Representative Patricia Schroeder, of
Colorado, recommended a "defense protection fee" on all Japanese imports, to
make the connection between our protection and their prosperity as bluntly
explicit as it can be: for each car the Japanese bring into America, they would
have to cover some of the cost of the American ships and planes that guard
Japan. Otherwise, why should the United States, with its huge deficits, keep
paying to protect a country whose surpluses pile up by the day?<p>

<p>

Behind these proposals, and the broader public grumbling about Japan's "free
ride," is the idea that America's economy has been hobbled by defense spending,
so in all fairness Japan's should be hobbled too. Or, to put it more
pleasantly, that Japan should take up some of America's burden, so that the two
economies can compete on a fairer and more equal basis. However it may be
phrased, the essential idea is that Japan has been imposing on our good will
for just about long enough. Who won the war, anyway? If the Japanese don t back
off from their aggressive trading practices, we will have to teach them a
lesson by withdrawing some of the military protection we magnanimously
provide.<p>

<p>

I think this concept has things exactly the wrong way around. The military
relationship between Japan and America, "free ride" and all, is much better for
each party than any alternative I've heard suggested so far. The division of
labor is complicated and obviously unequal--even if Japan is paying more and
more of the cost of defending its own home territory, it has nothing like
America's worldwide military costs. Still, it sounds easier to correct the
imbalance, by "making" Japan pay its way, than it turns out to be when you look
at the details. We can do ourselves a favor if we concentrate on our real
disagreements with Japan, about trade policy, and forget about the "free
ride."<p>

<p>

Before getting into the details, let's step back to consider how much damage
the defense imbalance does, and how the United States got itself in this bind.
Of course the difference between the Japanese and American defense budgets is
enormous, and is a significant economic problem for the United States. Some
Japanese officials have recently been trying to convince people that the
imbalance is not as large as it seems. After all, they point out, Japan is now
overtaking Britain and has the third-largest military budget in the world,
which sounds about right for a country with the world's second-largest economy.
"Third-largest," however, is completely misleading, because it reflects little
more than the enormous increase in the value of the yen. In 1985 Japan's
defense budget was the eighth largest in the world, comparable to those of such
questionable powers as Italy and Poland. Since then the budget as measured in
yen has gone up steadily but modestly, in pace with the Japanese economy as a
whole--from about 3.1 trillion yen in 1985 to about 3.7 trillion in 1988. As
measured in dollars, however, the budget zoomed upward by more than 200 percent
in those same three years. Because international budget comparisons are still
made in dollars, it's the exchange rate, rather than a real defense buildup,
that has propelled Japan toward the top of the charts. Even at these inflated
dollar-yen rates, Japan's defense spending is about one tenth of America's,
roughly $30 billion a year versus roughly $300 billion. If we use NATO's system
of measuring defense budgets, which includes (as Japan's does not) military
pensions and other costs in the total, Japan's spending comes to about 1.7
percent of its GNP. This is still much less than that of any major Western
country. In terms of the burden the country imposes on itself, Japan has at
most the twentieth-largest military budget in the world.<p>

<p>

U.S. industry is handicapped in a further way, relative to Japan's. When
American military interests have collided with the interests of American
companies, U.S. policy has favored the military. It is more convenient for
American commanders, for example, if allied nations all use similar equipment.
Therefore the Pentagon has willingly licensed advanced weapons technology to
NATO countries, Korea, and Japan, so that they can build compatible equipment
for themselves. The F-15s that are the backbone of Japan's air force are
manufactured in Japan, under license from McDonnell Douglas. This approach, of
course, erodes America's technical lead and in many cases has spawned direct
competition in the arms business.<p>

<p>

Japan's bias has been just the opposite of America's. Its military commanders
would be much better off if Japan imported its weapons, rather than building
them domestically in small, costly production runs. But, unlike the United
States, Japan can put commercial interests over military ones, so it spends 90
percent of its procurement money at home. Last year Japan faced a
black-and-white choice between military efficiency and promotion of its own
industry, when it selected a new fighter plane for its air force. Every factor
except industrial promotion pointed toward one decision: buying the F-16
fighter plane from the United States. The F-16 was available immediately, it
was battle-tested, and it was comparatively cheap. This is one case in which
every normal market standard favored the U.S.-made product.<p>

<p>

And yet Japan attempted for as long as possible to design and build an entirely
new airplane, all its own, as an entry to one of the few industries in which it
is still behind. The U.S. government was indignant about these plans. Japan
eventually threw us a sop, by agreeing to accept the blueprints and technical
specifications for the F-16, and, after modifying the wings and radar and
certain other parts, to build the new "FSX" planes in Japan, with some American
subcontracting. Japan's military will suffer from this deal. The planes won't
be ready until the middle of the next decade, and they will cost about twice as
much as F-16s. But Japanese industry will, for the first time, have the
experience of putting together a modern plane from drawing-board to final
assembly.<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE FSX deal is, as The New York Times said in an uncharacteristically
sharp-tongued editorial, "one-sided and unfair." But does it, or any other part
of the military-spending imbalance, mean that the United Suites can eliminate
its burden by changing its military relationship with Japan? Unfortunately, it
does not. In principle, Japan could solve the "free ride" problem in either of
two ways. It could spend much more on its own defense, or it could pay more of
America's costs--essentially hiring the United States for Pacific defense. The
United States will have a very hard time persuading Japan to do either.<p>

<p>

The first approach--putting pressure on Japan to expand its own military--would
be wildly unpopular in Japan and everywhere else in Asia. Japan and its
neighbors remember the Second World War in different ways, but the memory
leaves all of them hostile to the idea of a strongly re-armed Japan.<p>

<p>

It is hard for most Americans to imagine how deep is the fear of Japanese
rearmament that spreads across the rest of Asia--and that persists in Japan as
well. Someone who had never opened a history book might look at today's Japan
and conclude that the fear was completely absurd. This is about as
civilian-looking and nonmilitarized a society as you will find. True, many
parts of Japanese life do seem regimented and quasi-military. But these are the
civilian parts: the industries, where workers do calisthenics beneath snapping
company flags, with martial music booming through the air; the schools, where
boys wear shorts all through the winter to show that they are tough. The
fierceness and esprit in the military itself cannot compare. There are some
250,000 soldiers in the jieitai (literally, "self-defense force," rather than
"army"), but they're practically invisible. Soldiers refuse to wear their
uniforms in public; they commute in civilian clothes and change once they get
to work. In any case, the uniforms seem bus-conductor-like and deliberately
nonmartial, especially by comparison with the severe Prussian-style outfits
worn by high school students.<p>

<p>

Japan's equivalent of the Pentagon is situated near the Roppongi stop on
Tokyo's subway, in a chic tourist and nightclub district. If you ride the
Washington, D.C., Metro to the Pentagon stop, you will see uniformed soldiers
by the hundreds; I have never seen a uniform in the Roppongi crowds. The
Defense Agency proudly releases polls showing that Japanese people have a
favorable impression of the military. But according to these same polls, 77
percent of the Japanese public think that the military's most valuable function
has been to clean up after typhoons and provide other forms of disaster
relief.<p>

<p>

In today's Japan of Sony and Toyota, joining the military is a very
unfashionable career move and the jieitai has a harder and harder time
attracting recruits. It is about 30,000 soldiers below the level authorized by
Japanese policy, and there are relatively few people in the reserves.<p>

<p>

The army would be in terrible trouble if it were not for the southern island of
Kyushu, which contains only about an eighth of Japan's people but seems
(judging by the soldiers I've met) to produce most of its recruits. In Kyushu,
which has a long history of famous warrior clans, I have heard families say
that they wanted their sons to grow up to be soldiers or sailors, but not
anywhere else. Three years ago I interviewed cadets at the National Defense
Academy, in Yokosuka, where future officers are trained. I asked them why they
had chosen careers in the military. The ones who weren't from Kyushu often gave
answers like "failed my exams for Todai" (the hallowed University of Tokyo) and
"wanted a free education."<p>

<p>

There is an air of unseriousness about Japan's military undertakings, which is
especially noticeable by comparison with the deadly earnestness of everything
else. Soldiers are officially just another kind of government employee: there
is no court-martial system, no penalty for refusing to join the military after
getting a free education at the academy, no system of emergency laws empowering
the military to do what it must for national security. At the Japanese
air-force base in Okinawa an officer was giving me a lecture about the
supersensitive "hot scramble hangars," where F-4 fighters wait to intercept the
Soviet planes that fly close to Japanese air space every two or three days.
Just as he finished warning me not to get too close or take any pictures, an
All Nippon Airways jumbo jet taxied by, full of vacationers gawking out the
windows at the hangars. At Okinawa, as at the other major Japanese air-force
base--Chitose, on the northern island of Hokkaido--the air force has to share
runway space with, and be bossed around by, the civilian airlines. Political
"debates" about defense usually begin and end with statistics. "Discussions in
the Diet are always and only about the 'one percent limit,'" says Motoo Shiina,
one of the rare politicians known as an expert on defense. "You can sulk about
one percent for an hour, pro or con, but you shouldn't talk about anything
else."<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HERE are many explanations for Japan's nonchalance about the military. The
most obvious is Article IX of its postwar Constitution, drafted in English by
General Douglas MacArthur's occupation experts and translated into stilted
Japanese. Contrary to general belief in the United States, this "Peace
Constitution" does not set a ceiling on Japanese defense spending. The "limit"
of one percent was in fact merely a policy guideline adopted "for the time
being" by the Cabinet of Prime Minister Takeo Miki in 1976. Eleven years later,
under Yasuhiro Nakasone, Japan broke the limit when its spending reached 1.004
percent of GNP. The change was more significant than the tiny violation might
suggest. For one thing, Nakasone's government presented a Midterm Defense
Program, which outlined the new equipment the military would buy from 1986 to
1990. Such plans had existed before, but this was the first one backed up by
real money. The government committed 18 trillion yen (about $150 billion at
current rates) to be spent on the military over five years, at a time when most
domestic spending was being reduced. This should be enough to buy all the
weapons listed in the plan, and enough to keep defense spending slightly above
one percent of GNP. Also, this move was an attempt to move Japanese defense
discussions away from the one-percent obsession, so that budgets could be based
on what the military actually needed. In principle, the government now sets
budgets without worrying about the limit, but in practice, anything above one
percent creates intense political resistance in Japan.<p>

<p>

Rather than limiting defense spending, Article IX of the Constitution prohibits
it altogether--or so it seems, if the original English version is taken at face
value. "Land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never
be maintained," it says, because Japan "forever renounce[s]" resorting to armed
force as a sovereign right. Japan has worked its way toward its current sizable
military force through a series of judicial and political "reinterpretations"
of the Constitution. The crucial legal concept has been the idea that no nation
can renounce the right to defend itself against attack, much as no individual
is allowed to sell himself into slavery. Until 1950 MacArthur's policy
discouraged Japan from developing an armed force of any sort. But as American
soldiers were called away to Korea, MacArthur ordered Japan to establish a
National Police Reserve, comprising some 75,000 men, which later evolved into
the Ground Self-Defense Force.<p>

<p>

Some Japanese intellectuals contend that the half-serious, bastard nature of
the jieitai is spiritually bad for the country. Shuichi Kato, a renowned
leftist literary critic, was staunchly against the Vietnam War and is always
alert for signs of renascent militarism in Japan. But when I first met him, in
1986, he said, "And yet you cannot deny that Americans were risking their lives
in Vietnam for something they believed. Japan is not asked to do that now."
Hideaki Kase, from the opposite end of Japan's political spectrum, says
essentially the same thing. Kase, best known for his veneration of Japan's
imperial family, says, "We have been playing a very profitable game of posing
as unconscientious objectors. We base our defense policy not on preparation
against a hostile threat from the Russians but on the need to placate the
Americans." In contrast, Masataka Kosaka, a professor at Kyoto University who
is known as one of Japan's few "defense intellectuals," says that Japan's
military has a spiritual advantage over those of most other countries. In the
age of nuclear weapons, he says, fewer and fewer armies from major countries
will actually fight, and yet somehow they must maintain morale. Japan's army
has lived with this predicament for more than thirty years, he says, and it
will set the model for armies of the twenty-first century.<p>

<p>

Whether the hazy legality of the jieitai is good or bad for Japan, it indicates
Japan's lack of interest in expanding its military. Public-opinion polls in
Japan show overwhelming resistance to increases in defense spending. (In a
recent poll 80 percent of respondents favored keeping spending at or below the
current level of one percent.) Moreover, Japan's peculiar way of remembering
the Second World War intensifies the resistance to re-arming. Japan is not
exactly guilt-ridden about its role in the war--the Peace Memorial Museum, in
Hiroshima, for instance, begins its historical narrative with the American
firebombing of Tokyo in the spring of 1945, with no mention of any preceding
unpleasantness. But Japan seems unanimously and permanently convinced that the
war led to catastrophe for the country. Moreover, the prevalent view in Japan
is that the war was caused by a clique of semi-crazed militarists, who seized
control of the country and forced everyone else into what was clearly a
suicidal undertaking. This attitude is tremendously irritating to Chinese or
Koreans who are looking for signs of personal contrition from the Japanese, but
it actually makes for a very durable kind of anti-militarism--one based on
self-interest. "The war created lasting suspicion of the military, but not
because we made other people suffer," Shuichi Kato says. "The memory of the war
is that we suffered so much." Most mature Japanese can remember the utter ruin
of the postwar years; they blame General Tojo and his cronies for it, and they
don't want the military to have another chance.<p>

<p>

In the rest of Asia there is more of an edge to memories of Japan's wartime
role. As I've listened to officials--in China, especially--warn about the
danger of a militarized Japan, I've suspected that their fears were partly put
on for effect. Japan's war record is one of its few vulnerabilities, and these
warnings are a way to get America's attention. Still, I've heard the warnings
in every neighboring country (except Burma, where the Japanese are generally
viewed as liberators who kicked out the British), and for the most part the
apprehension seems sincere. Throughout Asia the least popular American trend is
the apparent enthusiasm for big Japanese defense spending. Lee Kuan Yew, the
Prime Minister of Singapore, has warned for years about the dangers of Japanese
re-armament, although recently he has started saying that a bigger Japanese
military is inevitable and that the crucial thing is for it to keep working as
a junior partner to the Americans. "As long as our military seems firmly under
the guidance of the Americans, the rest of Asia will not worry too much," says
Masashi Nishihara, a professor of international relations at the National
Defense Academy. "If we ever went off independently, everyone would be
afraid."<p>

<p>

In short, deeply felt emotions in Japan and throughout the rest of Asia put a
low ceiling on Japan's potential military spending. Long before the defense
budget increased enough to hobble the Japanese economy, it would have provoked
some political reaction from China and South Korea, and probably the Soviet
Union as well. (Exactly what kind of reaction is impossible to say, but it
certainly couldn't leave northeast Asia as free of major conflict as it has
been since the Korean Wan) But there is a further limit on Japan's spending: it
is hard to see what Japan could spend a lot of extra money for.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE question of "enough" is hard for any country considering its national
defense to resolve, but it is particularly baffling for Japan's military. In
theory, Japan could cut its military budget to zero and still feel more or less
secure, relying on the U.S. nuclear deterrent and on the knowledge that no one
has dared invade the home islands of Japan since the time of Kublai Khan. Or
Japan could equally well decide that its national-security interests extend to
every ship that brings in raw materials or carries out exports; in that case,
Japan would need to build the world's biggest navy to "defend" itself
completely.<p>

<p>

In practice, Japan has defined "enough" by taking on, one after another, jobs
that America has handed it during the past two decades. Its military now has
three main missions: to be ready to defend the northern island of Hokkaido
against a Russian assault; to be able to seal up the crucial straits of Soya,
Tsugaru, and Tsushima, through which the Soviet navy must pass to get from
Vladivostok to the open sea, and in general to erect air and sea defenses that
will keep the Soviet military bottled up in Siberia in time of war; and to
patrol the commercial shipping lanes leading southward from Japan toward the
Philippines and the Straits of Malacca. In principle, this means that Japan is
now completely responsible for defending itself with conventional weapons
against a conventional attack. The U.S. military's part of the bargain is to
provide a nuclear deterrent and, through the destroyers and aircraft carriers
of the Seventh Fleet, to do the kind of long-range "power projection" that no
Asians want the Japanese to undertake.<p>

<p>

Japan's assignments are somewhat vague and open-ended. For instance, the
responsibility for defending sea lanes, since 1981 mainly against Soviet
submarines, has included a thousand-mile stretch. But exactly how the Japanese
will divide this labor with the United States, and how much sea power they will
deploy, is unclear. What is clear is that Japan is well on its way to having a
big enough army to do its jobs, even at its current "free ride" budget levels.
Under the current Midterm Defense Program, Japan is supposed to increase its
force of F-15 fighters to 700, and modernize its 100 F-4s. It will replace its
older Nike anti-aircraft missiles with Patriot missiles, increase the number of
its P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from 50 to 100, and build 10 new
destroyer-type surface ships. Even during the Reagan-era military buildup the
U.S. inventory of most major weapons shrank, because the cost of weapons rose
faster than the budget. For the next few years Japan will be the only major
military power in the world that is buying new weapons and at the same time
expanding the size of its force. Japanese military officials often say that
their forces are small and humble, but most other defense authorities I've
interviewed here say that Japan has no urgent need for new hardware which
implementing the Midterm Defense Program won't meet.<p>

<p>

Japan's military still has some glaring weaknesses. According to U.S.
observers, it has never laid in adequate supplies of ammunition, fuel, or spare
parts. "They better hope the first volley holds off the Russians," an American
military officer says. "They've barely got one reload of missiles." Also, the
three branches of the Japanese military are even more uncoordinated and prone
to backbiting than the branches of America's are. When a Japan Air Lines jumbo
jet crashed in the mountains outside Tokyo in 1985, the rescuers reached the
site twelve hours late, in part because the air force, the army, various police
forces, and other government agencies were trying to decide who should do what
in the rescue effort. The survivors reported that several other people were
alive after the crash but died during the night, while the branches of the
jieitai spun their wheels. "This delay cost several lives," says Masataka
Kosaka, of Kyoto University. "In wartime such behavior would be
catastrophic."<p>

<p>

Despite such problems, many serious military analysts conclude that Japan is
smoothly moving toward "enough." Shunji Taoka, a veteran defense writer for
Japan's most prestigious newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, has prepared a dense
analysis showing that the Soviet Union lacks the troop carriers and transport
planes to overwhelm Japanese defenses during a surprise attack on Hokkaido.
Moreover, he says, the Soviet Far Eastern fleet is sure to weaken over the next
decade, because its ships are aging faster than they are being replaced. "Japan
exercises the responsibility for its own non-nuclear defense," Michael Armacost
told me shortly before he was nominated to succeed Mike Mansfield as the U.S.
ambassador to Japan. "Japan already possesses substantially more destroyers
than we deploy in the Seventh Fleet; it has a larger force of surveillance
aircraft than we maintain in the Pacific; it has nearly as many fighter
aircraft defending its territory as we have defending the continental United
States. This is a significant force and provides solid protection."<p>

<p>

Japan can undoubtedly go much further toward having "enough." One executive of
an American defense contractor, based in Tokyo, says that he has a vision of
"porcupine Japan," bristling with cruise missiles and electronic air-defense
systems that protect it against attack without threatening any of its
neighbors. Japan can also, and will, increase its foreign-aid payments, which
is a subject for another time. But--to get back to the main point--nothing in
Japan's internal politics, its relations with its neighbors, or its military
plans will make it spend enough money to weaken its economy as that of the
United States is now weakened.<p>

<p>

<p><br>

<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HAT leaves the other possibility--forcing Japan to shoulder some of America's
military costs. Americans imagine that they have tremendous leverage against
Japan on this point: Pay up or we'll leave you exposed. This, however, would be
an undignified position for America to take. Worse, it wouldn't work.<p>

<p>

As long as the United States remains a military power in the Pacific, it needs
Japan's cooperation at least as much as Japan needs U.S. protection. I mean
cooperation not in some abstract sense but as a practical matter of where the
United States can station its troops and dock its ships. In West Germany and
South Korea, American troops are stationed largely near the front, to guarantee
that they'd be involved if fighting began. But there is not a single United
States soldier in Hokkaido, the most likely invasion site in Japan (to the
extent that any site is likely). Of the 55,000 U.S. soldiers and sailors in
Japan, two thirds are based in Okinawa, a thousand miles southwest of Tokyo,
where they are mainly a swing force to be used in Korea or elsewhere in Asia.
The other major concentrations include a U.S. Air Force base in Misawa, in
northern Japan, the closest of all American bases to the imposing Soviet
military centers on Sakhalin Island; the naval base at Yokosuka, a crucial
dry-dock and refitting site for the U.S. Seventh Fleet; Army facilities at Zama
and a naval air installation at Atsugi, both near Tokyo; and a Marine air base
at Iwakuni, near Hiroshima. "We are not being honest...when we talk as though
American overseas military deployments have been essentially altruistic--not
for ourselves but for our allies," Martin Weinstein, of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, in Washington, D.C., said in congressional
testimony last fall. The real problem for America is not that it has to keep
bases in Japan but that it might lose them, according to Dennis J. Doolin, a
former Pentagon official who specialized in U.S.-Japanese relations. "We
are...in a logistically ideal strategic posture in Northeast Asia," Doolin has
written, "and we had better learn to appreciate this fact and stop
complaining....Japan's contribution is enormous, unique, irreplaceable, and
invaluable."<p>

<p>

Moreover, Japan already bears more of the cost of the American troops stationed
on its territory than does any other allied country. Its program of
"host-country support" covers about 40 percent of the roughly $6 billion cost
of keeping American soldiers there, and the Japanese-paid proportion is
increasing every year. (Japan says that under its Constitution and its-Status
of Forces Agreement with the United States it can't pay the salaries of
American soldiers or direct military operating costs, like those for fuel and
supplies. It is gradually taking over most other costs.) The presence of
foreign troops creates inevitable irritations: think how Americans would feel
if, instead of "buying up America" in some theoretical way, the Japanese had
soldiers in Chicago and aircraft carriers cruising through the Golden Gate. The
Japanese government goes out of its way to deflect resentment of the United
States. For instance, when some trees in a diminutive forest were cut down last
year to make way for new U.S. military housing, creating a huge controversy,
the Defense Agency made clear that Japan's government, not America's, had
authorized the project. Just about everything Japan can do for the American
military in Japan it is already doing or getting ready to do.<p>

<p>

The one big exception to Japan's generally cooperative approach
is--surprise--its weapons-buying policy. Each time Japan insists on
industrial-strategy projects like the FSX,--it feeds all the worst suspicions
about its sense of balance and fair play. But these disputes should be thought
of the way the Japanese think of them--as trade disputes, not military ones.
Japan could ease trade frictions, while getting twice as many weapons for its
money, if it bought planes and missiles directly from the United States, rather
than building them at home. But this will be one of the last areas Japan opens
to imports. Japanese officials are quite candid about their determination to
develop their own aircraft industry and in general to use military contracts
for industrial development. They are less candid about exports of military
equipment, which now occur on a small scale and could increase, because the
main barrier to them is not Japan's Constitution but its fear of international
reaction. Last summer the Tokyo office of Warburg Securities released an
influential report on Japan's nascent arms industries, including strong "buy,"
recommendations for major defense contractors such as Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, Japan Aircraft Manufacturing, and Fuji Heavy Industries.<p>

<p>

Where does this leave America? With little bargaining power to use over Japan
in military matters--and little reason to use it. Japan is happier for having
the United States as the big military power in the Pacific, so is the rest of
Asia, and so is the United States. Every strategic and military trend in the
area is favorable to American interests. There are no wars under way outside
Indochina; most countries are becoming richer, freer, and more democratic. The
only "threat" most Asian countries pose to the United States is through
economic competition. Much of what is right in Asia is right because of the
U.S. military presence, which has helped Japan to flourish peacefully and has
kept everyone else from worrying about Japan. It would be shortsighted to upset
this arrangement just to solve some trade problems. Trade problems are better
dealt with on their own.

than profit. Recently, when I asked people I know why they had had 
children, they talked about family values, about the kind of people they 
want to be, about the kind of world they want to leave behind. The one 
reason for having children that never came up was economic need.<P>
This is a curious thing, when you stop to think about it. Not so many 
generations ago people had children because they needed them. In those 
simpler, more agrarian days, a child was an extra set of hands to help 
support the family. And a child was insurance against being left 
unsupported and indigent in one's dotage. Earlier cultures didn't have the 
luxury of thinking of children as strictly a nonprofit venture. And the 
truth is, we don't either. Socializing many of the costs of old age let us 
think for a while that we had transcended the ancient economics of family. 
Now it seems that we were kidding ourselves.<P>
Children are very expensive--in terms of time, career, opportunities 
forgone, and cash. Thomas J. Espenshade, of Princeton University, has 
calculated that a middle-class family with two children is likely to spend 
about $100,000 to rear each child to age eighteen. And because people 
today are less likely to have children and the ones who do have children 
are having fewer of them, the American fertility rate is barely half what 
it was thirty years ago, when the Baby Boom was at its peak. Of the 
children that we do have, a higher proportion have been impoverished in 
this decade than at any other time since 1965: as of 1987 one in five 
American children lived in a poor family--this when the economy was 
strong. Forty-six percent of all black children lived in poverty in 1987; 
so did 40 percent of all Hispanic children. In New York City 38 percent of 
the children are poor. Why all this matters to the middle class may not be 
immediately obvious--which is just the problem. If boys and girls grew up 
to become industrial machinery instead of men and women, it would be easy 
to see that everybody had a stake in other peoples children.<P>
"Kids are a form of capital," David P. Hale. the chief economist of Kemper 
Financial Services, in Chicago, told me recently, when I asked him what 
was behind all the talk about "investing" in children "There was always an 
intellectual camp running around saying these things. But suddenly the 
intellectual camp has a following, out of need." As the sparse generation 
of the Baby Bust enters the work force, business is discovering that the 
supply of qualified young workers is tightening.<P>
This same sparse generation will have to undertake the potentially 
staggering burden, starting early in the next century, of paying the 
public costs of their parents' dependency. Inexorably, the 
intergenerational circle closes. Here is a question that every working-age 
American might do well to ask himself; If we have fewer kids, and if more 
of the ones we do have are slouching toward adulthood from poverty then 
how generously am I going to be supported in my old age?<P>
The past half century has established as a basic principle of American 
life that we will pay for other people's retirements. Today, as we face 
the need to nurture our work force and safeguard our retirements, the 
question forcing its way onto the agenda is how much more we will pay for 
other people's children. More out of necessity than out of choice, a new 
redistributional politics is emerging--a politics of redistribution from 
the childless to the child-rearing.<P>
It is no accident that George Bush, a pro-business, more or less 
conservative Republican, has proposed a European-style children's 
allowance. The proposal, a per-child federal subsidy for parents, would 
help only the poorest and is modest in scale--so modest that many liberals 
sneer at it, perhaps unwisely. A lot of the critics miss the point. 
Conceptually speaking, the Bush children's tax credit is a political 
preview of the next few decades.<P>
<BR><p>
<b>THE FUTURE NEEDS KIDS</b><P>
The national "family," having had fewer children, is going to find early 
in the next century that its labor force has stopped growing. New entrants 
into the work force are already becoming a scarce commodity, at least 
relative to what the country has been accustomed to. Projections are 
showing that in the 1990s the U.S. labor force will grow more slowly than 
it has at any time since the 1930s. Fully a third of the new entrants into 
the work force between now and the turn of the century will be members of 
minority groups. Those future minority workers are today's minority 
children--among whom the rates of poverty and illiteracy are highest. On 
average, poor children grow up to make poor workers. Poor workers generate 
lower standards of living for society--and for their old parents. The 
primordial interdependence of generations ultimately makes itself felt, 
albeit at the level of the national unit rather than the family unit.<P>
"The two ways that a society provides for its future," Frank Levy, an 
economist at the University of Maryland, told me, "are its level of 
physical capital accumulation"--that is, the number and quality of its 
machines, factories, roads, and so on--"and the number and the quality of 
its kids. In both cases, you can cheat on the accumulation and, by doing 
that, raise your current consumption. But eventually it comes back to 
haunt you."<P>
Right now about one in eight Americans is sixty-five or older. That will 
start changing fast, as the Baby Boom generation marches in unprecedented 
numbers across the line between work and retirement. According to 
projections by the Census Bureau, by late in the 2020s one in five 
Americans will be sixty-five or older. As the proportion of dependent 
elderly people in the adult population rises, the number of workers 
supporting each of them must fall. And that is exactly what is going to 
happen. The number of working-age people on hand to support each elderly 
person will drop by almost half, from almost five in 1990 to about two and 
a half by 2030 or so.<P>
This is a retirement burden whose like no generation of American workers 
has yet borne. John L. Palmer, of Syracuse University, has figured that 
the federal tax take will have to rise by an amount equivalent to at least 
five percent of the gross national product, and quite possibly a good bit 
more, to cover the health and pension costs of the Baby Roomers' 
retirement. Today the government takes in about 19 percent of the GNP in 
taxes. So we are talking about at least a 25 percent federal tax 
increase.<P>
Economically the burden is probably manageable. The important question is 
whether it is politically manageable. The country is already moving to 
raise the retirement age (thus increasing the worker-to-retiree ratio), 
and it's likely to have to reduce benefits to the elderly somewhat. But 
cutting benefits is politically inflammatory and, for those affected, 
personally wrenching. We can ease the need to take either step by making 
the workers we have more productive, getting more workers, or some 
combination of the two. For instance, we could save and invest more. That 
should boost the future productivity of the economy, making the retirement 
bill more affordable. Or we could import workers. Immigration, which 
brings new talent and muscle and youth to an aging population. is one of 
our richest resources--potentially a major advantage over Japan and the 
many European countries, like West Germany and France, that are aging even 
more rapidly than we are and that lack our immigrant tradition.<P>
Unfortunately, in a population as big as ours immigration can do only so 
much, and it is no substitute for seeing that the native labor force is 
adequately skilled. As for saving, the trouble is that we're saving less 
than we used to, not more, as our big budget deficits and low personal 
savings rates make clear. Besides, the better machines and equipment that 
we would presumably use our savings to invest in do not look after 
themselves; they tend to require better workers to run them. Inevitably, 
then, the discussion comes around to having more children or more
productive children or both--taking steps to replenish the child-capital 
stock, as it were.<P>
<BR><p>
<b>POLITICIANS NEED KIDS</b><P>
Many countries have long worried explicitly about the number and quality 
of their children; among the industrial countries, indeed, the United 
States is an oddity for its lack of an explicit or coherent family policy. 
Most of our allies and competitors run big redistribution programs to 
transfer money from people who don't have children to people who do. In 
some cases the rationale is out-and-out pronatalism: the idea is to get 
people to have more children, usually for cultural reasons even more than 
economic ones. France, in particular, has a long tradition of concern 
about the birth rate. Valery Giscard d'Estaing when he was the French 
President, once said, "A society no longer capable of assuring the 
replacement of generations is a condemned society." Many of the Western 
European programs that transfer money to families with children began as 
attempts to buy more children, although that goal has often faded away 
over time and been supplanted by social-welfare concerns.<P>
Eastern Europe, in contrast, remains explicitly pro-baby. Rumania doubled 
its fertility rate practically overnight after it took measures, in 1966, 
that sharply curtailed the availability of abortion, divorce, and 
contraception. (As it turned out, much of the effect was temporary.) 
Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia took the less 
intrusive, but very expensive, route of providing big economic inducements 
to parents--tax incentives, birth payments, preferential housing programs, 
paid maternity leave, and so on. According to one estimate, Hungary's 
inducement package paid more than a third of the costs of rearing 
children.<P>
Scholars who have examined incentive-based pronatalist programs generally 
conclude that over the long run they raise the birth rate very little, if 
at all--no doubt because government inducements of any practical size are 
overwhelmed by the total costs of rearing children and by considerations 
of life-style. (How much would the government have to pay you to have a 
child? Probably more than it could afford to.) "You get a short-run effect 
mainly in the timing of births," Thomas Espenshade, of Princeton, told me. 
"The lesson from Europe on these questions has been that governments have 
a difficult time buying babies, unless they're willing to spend several 
times more than they've been willing to spend to this point." Fertility 
rates in Eastern Europe are generally higher than those in noncommunist 
Europe, but whether that is owing to pronatalism or something else is a 
mystery.<P>
We Americans come from a different tradition. People here have always 
viewed the size of their families as a matter of personal rather than 
public concern. Yet even here some people are calling for outright 
pronatalism. One of them is Ben J. Wattenberg, of the American Enterprise 
Institute, a center right think tank in Washington, D.C. Citing Census 
Bureau projections that show the U.S. population ceasing to grow by the 
decade of the 2030s, Wattenberg thinks the government should offer big-
very big--per-child tax inducements to parents. "The only pronatalist 
policy that has any chance of working is serious dollars," he said. He is 
the first to admit that such a program might not get the birth rate up 
much. But even if it didn't, he pointed out, it would help solve the 
child-poverty problem. If you want to say what's the biggest problem in 
America, and you want to put it in two very short words, it's poor kids," 
Wattenberg said. "The question is, Can you make it easier for young 
couples who want to have children to be able to have children? You have 
half a century where the basic drive of this government--properly, in my 
judgment--was a redistribution of wealth from rich to poor. That isn't 
going to wash politically anymore. But suppose you say, instead of 
redistributing from rich to poor, 'Hey, I've got a pro-family program that 
redistributes money from the childless to the child-rearing.'" That kind 
of program could get liberals and conservatives on the same side, he said. 
"It's pro-family and it's pro-kids, and it's pro-poor-kids."<P>
He has a point. The way to get people to have more children is generally 
the same as the way to relieve poverty among children, which is generally 
the same as the way to help struggling young middle-class parents; 
transfer money to families with children. That fact helps account for the 
broad support in European countries for family-benefits programs. More 
than sixty countries, including most of the industrial ones, have what are 
known as family allowances or children's allowances, which typically pay 
families for each child an equivalent of five to ten percent of the 
average wage. The benefits may or may not be taxed, but they are generally 
universally available.<P>
Furthermore, well over a hundred countries, including Canada and countries 
throughout Europe, give one or both parents cash and time off from work 
when they have a new baby--typically about four months' paid leave. It's 
also common for countries to provide preschool or other child care for 
children three or older; France, Sweden, Italy, West Germany, Finland, 
Denmark, the Netherlands, Israel, and a number of Eastern European 
countries do that. All in all, America's transfer payments to children, 
measured as a percentage of the national output are less than half those 
of, for instance, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada.<P>
Generous family benefits have not created any sort of baby boom overseas. 
But they certainly help account for the fact that child-poverty rates are 
much lower abroad than here. I asked Sheila B. Kamerman, of the Columbia 
University School of Social Work, why public benefits for families with 
children are so generous in Europe and elsewhere. "The concept," she 
replied, "is that people with children are making a contribution to 
society, in terms of producing the future labor force and the quality of 
that labor force, the quality of citizens--even, if you will, financing 
the social
security system. Children are viewed as a social resource." This is less 
true in the United States. "The only way families with children have 
sustained their income in the last fifteen years has been with increased 
labor-force participation by mothers," Kamerman said. "Families have been 
putting more and more effort into rearing children, and it doesn't seem to 
be recognized. And the society is very dependent on those children, 
ultimately."<P>
In Europe the wide appeal of pro-family policies rests on a convergence of 
political interests. The right likes programs that support bigger 
families; the left likes programs that help prevent child poverty. "We may 
be moving in a similar direction," Kamerman observed. Political pressure 
is mounting to socialize more of the costs of raising kids--that is, to 
spread the burden of child-rearing.<P>
<BR><p>
<b>BUSINESS NEEDS KIDS</b><P>
In Washington you can hardly turn around these days without hearing about 
children's and family issues. Liberals are horrified at the high rate of 
poverty among children, and they understand that the best way to get money 
to needy families is to point out that these families have needy children. 
The right, too, is fighting for the pro-family banner. Social 
conservatives have been worrying for some time about economic and social 
pressures on the "traditional" family. They are pushing initiatives to 
come to families' aid. So, it seems, is almost everyone else. You can 
practically drown under the waves of press conferences and legislative 
proposals and speeches on children and families.<P>
The social activists have a new and important ally. "In the seventies," 
Frank Levy, of the University of Maryland, said, "corporations had workers 
coming out of their ears, so they didn't have to worry about the quality 
of the work force. They could just discard what they couldn't use. But 
once you have the labor force growing slowly and you start bumping into 
scarcity, then you have to assess the quality of the whole work force, 
because you can't just throw away the bottom quarter or twenty percent. 
Then you realize that we're all in this together."<P>
Today business is making contact with the sparse generation and finding it 
lacking. Alan Magazine, the president of the Council on Competitiveness, a 
Washington-based group whose leadership includes representatives of 
business, labor, and education, remarked in an interview with me, "We 
have, in a sense, a ticking time bomb that can't be ignored anymore. Some 
people have been saying that for years, but now people in the corporations 
are really seeing it. They're seeing it in the kinds of people they're 
hiring, the amount of money they have to spend for basic learning to get 
people up to a level that they can do even menial jobs; they're seeing it 
in the results of the tests that they give hundreds of people for 
minimum-wage jobs, and the numbers of people who actually pass those 
tests."<P>
The past few years have witnessed a redoubling of business's interest in 
issues relating to children and youth--above all, education, but also day 
care, child poverty, and so on. When I asked Walter B. Wriston, a former 
chairman of Citicorp, what accounted for this, he replied flatly, "The 
reason they're interested in it is, like anybody, self-interest. It isn't 
that people are more or less sensitive to education; it's that the 
realization grows that when a college freshman can't pick out the United 
States on a map of the world, we've got a problem."<P>
It is no coincidence that pro-business Republicans in Washington are 
starting to get interested in social issues--not just as "fairness" 
issues, which Republicans regard as belonging to Democrats, but as 
"productivity" issues, which Republicans view as their specialty. When 
business talks, Republicans listen. One morning in his office late last 
year, Senator Pete Domenici--a conservative, pro-business, 
balance-the-budget Republican who represents New Mexico--startled me by 
saying that it's time for the federal government to mount a campaign 
against what he called "socio
economic drags": the effects of undereducation, drugs, and poverty on the 
children of the inner cities. "I think these are very, very dangerous 
things for our economic productivity," he said. "They're not just social 
issues." We're only going to be hearing more of this kind of talk.<P>
<BR><p>
<b>COMMON GROUND?</b><P>
Businesses can attest to the fact that transferring resources to families 
with children doesn't necessarily involve government. Corporations are 
finding themselves providing more parental-support services to their 
workers. They have to. Employees with day-care problems lose productive 
hours, and so the number of companies in this country providing some sort 
of day-care help has risen dramatically in recent years. A mother who has 
a premature baby lands her company (if it provides health-care benefits) 
with big hospital bills, and so companies have started to provide maternal 
education programs. New parents need time off from work, and so a growing 
number of companies, especially large ones, provide paid parental leave. 
All these services are expensive. Consumers, stockholders, and childless 
employees pay.<P>
Many liberals like the idea of requiring businesses to assume more of the 
costs of children--for instance, they tend to favor legislation requiring 
companies to provide their workers with some form of maternity leave. 
Conservatives abhor that approach, although they usually aren't quick to 
suggest an alternative. That is not the only difference between the left 
and the right. Liberals, who seek to remove obstacles to women's entering 
the work force, want the government to provide day-care services for 
parents. Conservatives, many of whom would prefer that women care for 
their kids themselves, would rather just give parents money (which, in 
essence, is the strategy of Bush's proposed children's tax credit).<P>
Yet there is much common ground. I recently went to talk to Gary Bauer, 
the president of the Family Research Council of America, a conservative 
think tank on family policy and social values. Bauer was President 
Reagan's domestic-policy adviser for two years, and was known as one of 
the administration's hard-core social conservatives. When I arrived at his 
office, the first thing I picked up was a newsletter calling on the 
federal government to "offer assistance to first-time home buyers." "Home 
ownership," it complained, "is financially beyond the reach of many young 
families," and "such families should not have to choose between adopting a 
two career lifestyle or remaining perpetually propertyless." This is the 
kind of conservatism that liberal Democrats, who are the long-standing 
champions of government help for the middle class, ought to be able to cut 
a deal with.<P>
Bauer told me that an important strain of American conservatism has long 
focused on families, and on the stresses they encounter in trying to meet 
their responsibilities. "One of the things that astounded me when I was in 
the administration," he said, "was that from the end of World War Two to 
the present, the only group in society that really suffered a major 
increase in taxes, after adjusting for inflation and so on, was families 
with children"--which, he said, have taken an "incredible hit." In 
particular, the tax code's personal exemption is the main tax break for 
dependents. It allows you to subtract from your family's taxable income a 
certain amount per family member (now $2,000). In 1948 the exemption was 
high enough that a typical family with three or more children paid 
virtually no federal income taxes. Today the personal exemption has been 
so corroded by inflation that it would have to be more than tripled in 
order to shield from taxation as large a share of families' income as it 
did in 1948.<P>
Bauer's group, like many conservative organizations, favors greatly 
increasing the personal tax exemption, a step that, Bauer argues, would 
help all families with children, whether the woman chose to stay home or 
to work. I asked Bauer about per-child tax credits of the sort that many 
other countries have. "There's some support in the conservative community 
for the child-allowance approach," he said; but his group is still just 
considering it.<P>
Never underestimate the ability of liberals and conservatives to overcome 
their agreements and argue to a standstill. There are profound differences 
both within and between the left and the right over who should get relief 
from the high cost of kids (two-earner families or single-earner families 
or all families? everybody or just the poor?) and in what form relief 
should be provided (tax credits? tax exemptions? subsidized day care? 
mandated benefits for employees? cash?). "Both sides have philosophical 
approaches here that neither wants to concede," Bauer said. "I think there 
may be an inclination for gridlock for a while longer."<P>
<BR>
But something will give. Unrest in the middle class will see to that. 
Today almost two thirds of women with children--and well over half of 
married women with children under six--are in the work force, whether out 
of choice or out of necessity (the comparable figures in 1960 were 30 
percent and less than 70 percent, respectively). Many of these women and 
their husbands are financially strained, and they want help with the costs 
of their kids, and they vote. That, finally, is why President Bush found 
himself proposing a children's allowance.<P>
Well, who could be against doing more for families with children anyway? 
The answer is that people who do not have children could be against it, 
because they would pay the bill. And it is a big bill. According to the 
Census Bureau, 30 percent of American families with children were getting 
by on incomes of less than $20,000 in 1987. To give significant aid to 
significant numbers of those families runs into a lot of money fast. For 
instance suppose we raised the personal exemption to $6,300, so that it 
would shield as much of families' income as it did in 1948. Each child 
would then reduce a median-income family's taxes by about $950 a year as 
against about $300 today. An extra $650 per child per year wouldn't solve 
parents' every problem, but it would certainly help. The trouble is that a 
tax cut of that size would cost the Treasury enough to almost double the 
federal deficit. Making exceptions or targeting the poor would reduce the 
cost. But it would also weaken middle-class support, because it would 
change the issue from making children cheaper for everybody to making 
children cheaper for the poor--a very different kettle of fish, 
politically speaking. The unhappy fact is that any program, public or 
private, that brings substantial relief to middle-class parents is going 
to be very expensive.<P>
When we discuss spreading through society more of the burdens of child
rearing, we are talking about transferring money from the later part of 
adulthood to the earlier, and also from those who do not have children to 
those who do. People with families would get government subsidies during 
their child-rearing years; then, as they passed into middle age and 
beyond, they would pay higher taxes to support the younger group coming 
behind. People without children would simply pay higher taxes throughout 
life. That is the essence of the new redistributional politics: the 
middle-aged, the elderly, and the childless would inevitably have to 
sacrifice more so that young parents would not have to sacrifice so 
much.<P>
Within families, this sort of spreading of sacrifice between old and 
young, between those who have kids to support and those who don't, goes on 
all the time. The problem coming before us today is how to do something 
similar in society as a whole without tearing ourselves apart 
politically.

URING the past decade the one thing Americans have known for sure about the

federal budget deficit is that it is bad. Government spending soaked up money

that industries could have been using to create new technologies and new jobs.

No wonder incomes have grown so slowly, while the American economy as a whole

has worn its iron collar of debt.<p>



But what if the one thing we all know is wrong -- or, more precisely, what if it

is out of date? In the early 1980s, when budget deficits were soaring as a

share of the national economy, politicians were slow to recognize the political

and social distortions that a decade of heavy borrowing could create. Since the

early 1990s, in contrast, budget deficits have been shrinking in relative and

absolute terms. The broad context of the deficit is missing from public

discussions of the economy: the current bipartisan drive to eliminate the

deficit is occurring in the midst of falling wages, corporate downsizing, and

the Federal Reserve's push for zero inflation. <p>



What are the likely economic consequences of all these things happening at 

once?  In one of the following articles [<A HREF="./depress.htm">"The 

Forces Making for an Economic Collapse"</A>] Thomas I. Palley, a professor 

of economics at the New School for Social Research, argues that our next 

recession might turn into a depression.  The accompanying article [<A 

HREF="./clinton.htm">"The Economic Consequences of Mr.  Clinton"</A>], by 

Robert A. Levine, a former Congressional Budget Office economist, fits the 

Palley scenario into history, likening President Bill Clinton's economic 

policies to those of Winston 

Churchill in the 1920s, when, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Churchill 

followed the counsels of orthodoxy and deflated first the British and then 

the world economy as the Great Depression loomed.<p>



Unfortunately, everything Levine says against the Clinton policies applies even

more strongly to those of the Dole-Gingrich Republicans. The "demand-side

alternative" he outlines as a way back from Palley's brink has no champion in

this year's election.</font><p>

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>B</font>raniff Airlines' flight number 11, a.k.a. the LBJ special, leaves Washington's
Dulles Airport each afternoon at 5:35 on a nonstop trip to Austin. The flight,
which Braniff introduced with some reluctance during the heyday of the
Pedernales, is now a steady earner, and it makes Austin the smallest far-off
city with such direct connections to the capital.<p>

<p>

On one Sunday afternoon last September, the day that Gerald Ford pardoned
Richard Nixon, a lean, distinguished-looking man in his early fifties waited to
check in on flight 11. From the cut of his brown glen plaid suit and the
detached, slightly impatient look on his face, he might have been a banker from
Connecticut on his way to discuss investment possibilities in the computer
industry, or an executive of the Rockefeller Foundation preparing for a
conference at the University of Texas. He received no more attention than any
of the several hundred other passengers in the terminal, which was unusual only
because he, unlike anyone else in the building, was at work trying to become
the next President of the United States.<p>

<p>

Since the end of 1973, when be decided to spend a year finding out "whether a
moderate from Texas has a shot at the Democratic nomination," Lloyd M. Bentsen,
junior senator from the Lone Star state, has spent a great deal of his time as
he spent it that afternoon -- in transit between one public appearance and the
next. By Election Day, 1974, Bentsen had appeared in thirty-three states, and
had delivered some one hundred and thirty speeches. On the weekend he flew to
Texas, for example, he spoke in Indiana on Saturday, spent half an hour on
national TV on Sunday morning appearing with Senator William Brock on Face the
Nation, landed in Austin on Sunday evening, and on Monday morning was a major
speaker at the Southern Governors' Conference; there he walked over to George
Wallace's wheelchair to shake hands as the TV cameras rolled. He can please a
crowd, and did on this occasion. But in his speeches, and even more so in his
private conversation, he foxily avoids the specific commitment or the revealing
observation (on or off the record) that might prove embarrassing.<p>

<p>

During the first week in October, Bentsen spoke in Lansing, Michigan, on
Friday, in Wichita, Kansas, on Saturday, in San Antonio on Sunday morning, and
in Dallas on Sunday night; he flew back to Washington on Monday, departed that
night for Atlanta, taped another debate with Senator Brock on Tuesday morning,
and on Tuesday afternoon addressed a meeting of the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers in Miami.<p>

<p>

Through this year of physical and financial depletion (at one point in late
summer, Bentsen's advance calendar showed a total of five free nights before
the election; and much of a special $365,000 campaign fund has gone into the
year's effort), Bentsen was not technically "running." What he was doing, he
said, was deciding whether to run, conducting a sort of test marketing that
would enable him to make his final decision at the beginning of the new year.
If, as has seemed certain since the withdrawal of Teddy Kennedy, Bentsen
becomes a starter in this year of the dark horse, his campaign will be one of
the more fascinating. Its fascination is not that Bentsen is a probable -- or
at this moment even plausible -- victor, but that his type of presidential
politicking recalls something fifteen years past. Different inheritors have
appropriated different portions of the "Kennedy legacy" -- the looks and style
passed on to the two brothers; the reputation for social concern taken over by
assorted liberals; the tough-guy outlook on world affairs a tragic bequest to
Lyndon Johnson. But at least one part, the part evoked by phrases like
"tough-minded," "hard-boiled," "pragmatic," is riding with Lloyd Bentsen this
year.<p>

<p>

The predominant fact about Bentsen's national campaign is that he lacks a
national identity; in mid-1974, the Harris Poll gave him a name-recognition
figure of about 2 percent. But the problem is more profound than simply not
being well known, for Lloyd Bentsen's past is private. Before he was elected to
the Senate four and a half years ago, Bentsen had spent the greater part of his
adult years in the closed world of Houston high finance. Unlike Scoop Jackson,
who has been in Congress for thirty-four years, or Walter Mondale, who won
statewide office in 1960, or even Morris Udall, who entered the House in 1961,
Bentsen's record is a short one indeed. Save for his geographic identity as a
Texan, no great advantage so soon after the Johnson years, Bentsen carries the
handicap of anonymity -- and the corresponding advantage of being able to
create an identity <i>ex nihil</i>.<p>

<p>

The way in which national anonymity can be an advantage is illustrated by
Bentsen's position in Texas, where his well-known background is actually his
greatest handicap. Bentsen's modest senatorial prominence has made him stronger
at home now than he has ever been before, but there are still those who bear
him an abiding mistrust. Generally they cite three reasons.<p>

<p>

The first is his family background, for like a hard-boiled candidate of another
day, John F. Kennedy, Bentsen first entered politics backed by his father's
fortune, the accumulation of which has been a matter of public controversy. The
elder Bentsen, Lloyd Sr., moved with his brother Elmer from South Dakota to the
Texas Valley (the state's southern tip) in the 1920s, where the two soon made a
fortune in the "immigrant land business." In theory this meant nothing more
than selling land to people from far away, but in practice it often involved
greeting a trainload of Minnesotans, escorting them through acres of sunny
citrus land, and then selling them land identical in every respect save a lack
of water rights. Virtually worthless land, that is to say. In 1950,
dissatisfied customers began filing the first of several dozen lawsuits against
the elder Bentsens, alleging conspiracy and fraud. The plaintiffs in the first
test case, a couple from Iowa named Polmateer, claimed that they had paid $525
per acre for land worth, at most, one fifth that amount. The judge ruled in
their favor, and ordered the elder Bentsens to refund the Polmateers in full.
In another case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the elder Bentsens could
properly be sued to determine whether they had violated a federal statute.
Shortly thereafter, the Bentsens began settling most subsequent cases out of
court. At no time has anyone accused Lloyd Jr. of involvement in his father's
and uncle's affairs, but his first excursion into politics was financed by his
father's money.<p>

<p>

After attending the University of Texas Law School (he has no undergraduate
degree) and receiving decorations for flying fifty missions as a pilot in World
War II, Bentsen returned to what had become the family's political fiefdom, and
in 1946 was elected county judge. Two years later, in 1948, he was elected to
Congress, and, at age twenty-seven, was the youngest member that year.<p>

<p>

The second of Bentsen's burdens is his strong identification with the
big-money, Texas-Tory branch of the Democratic party, dominated by John
Connally before his Republican conversion, and associated (though never
contentedly) with Lyndon Johnson. Although Bentsen has supported Johnson and
Connally, and in turn been supported by them (Connally urged him to make his
1970 run for the Senate; in 1971, Johnson went so far as to say that Bentsen
might be "the greatest senator Texas has ever had"), it would be a mistake to
take either of them as a model for how Bentsen might perform in or around the
White House. Connally and Johnson both made themselves into rich men, but both
of them were born poor, Connally poorer than Johnson. Like Connally, wheeling
and dealing, Johnson often radiated with a "joie de con." But even during his
darkest days in the White House, no one could accuse Johnson of being merely a
manipulator. There was too much of the elemental man in him to justify so
simplistic a label, and he retained his commitment to the New Deal to the end.
All of these ingredients -- passion, ideology, and the hustler's glee -- seem
absent from Bentsen's managerial makeup.<p>

<p>

In his brief service in the House, Bentsen was a consistent if unsophisticated
conservative, with a generally unremarkable record. He must live today with one
of the few remarkable statements he made, his recommendation on July 12, 1950,
that the United States give the North Koreans one week's warning and then hit
them with atomic bombs. Although he was unopposed in all his races for
re-election, Bentsen decided to leave the House in 1954 "to establish financial
independence" for himself and his family -- his wife, Beryl Ann (nicknamed
B.A.), and his children, Lloyd III, Lan, and Tina, whose ages now range from
thirty to twenty-three.<p>

<p>

He accomplished his goal quickly in the insurance business. By the time he ran
against Yarborough, he was president of Lincoln Consolidated, a large holding
company with extensive insurance interests, and his personal worth was $2.3
million.<p>

<p>

Bentsen remained on the periphery of politics during these years but was
clearly affiliated with the Connally camp. He supported Connally in his various
races for the governorship, and at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago,
Beryl Ann Bentsen sat between Connally and Jake Jacobsen in the Texas
delegation. Connally urged Bentsen to run for the governorship in 1968, and two
years later played an important part in his successful race for the Senate.
Indeed, Bentsen was the last Texas politician Connally successfully anointed
before going on to Republicanism and disgrace.<p>

<p>

The 1970 election is the third and most inflammatory item on Bentsen's critics'
list, not because he beat George Bush, then a Republican congressman, in the
general election, but because he eliminated the incumbent senator, Ralph
Yarborough, in the Democratic primary. Yarborough had left fences unmended, and
might well have fallen to Bush, but he was the Texas liberals' hero, the only
one of their number to hold major office, and as such, a perfect candidate for
martyrdom. Bentsen played his role in this martyr's drama to perfection,
running an expensive, slick campaign which made heavy use of TV spots, and
taking a gloves-off, Agnewesque position on all the divisive social issues. He
pounded Yarborough on busing, school prayer, and -- in what Bentsen's own men
called the "World War III" spot -- antiwar protest. This last commercial, which
has entered the mythology of Texas politics, depicted civil disorder and
generalized mayhem, followed by Lloyd Bentsen's calm voice reminding the voters
that Yarborough had supported the moratorium, and asking whether this was the
kind of representation Texans really wanted.<p>

<p>

The ads were not so much dishonest as they were demagogic, and on Bentsen's
side it may be said that Yarborough engaged in a little demagoguery of his own
about the Bentsen family history. After the primary, Bentsen engaged in enough
reconciliation to enlist such liberals as Barbara Jordan, the black
congresswoman from Houston who was then a state senator, to his side. He beat
Bush by a 53 to 47 margin. Nonetheless, such was the residue of the primary
campaign that the Nixon Administration, which had sent its big guns to Texas on
Bush's behalf, embraced Bentsen after his victory in the fall as part of its
"ideological majority."<p>

<p>

<br>

<font size=5>A</font>S soon as he arrived in the Senate -- as soon, that is, as his record as a
national politician began -- Bentsen took pains to rid himself of the
right-wing image the campaign had given him. In one of his first speeches as a
senator, he formally rejected the Administration's embrace, saying that he was
an "establishment man" who believed in four establishments: the United States
of America, the United States Senate, the State of Texas, and the Democratic
party. This was the first step in a dance Bentsen has been practicing ever
since: a flattering <i>pas</i> toward his partners on either side, a coy step
back from the extreme. On nearly every issue of symbolic importance to the
liberals, the constituency farthest from his natural base, Bentsen has taken a
"correct" position. In his first few months in Congress, he voted to restrict
the right to filibuster, one of the few Old South senators ever to do so;
shortly thereafter, he fought Senator John Stennis to reduce funding for the
Trident submarine. He voted against the SST, he has sponsored mass-transit
legislation, and he has even taken his distance from big oil, sponsoring a
variety of proposals to restrict the major companies in favor of the smaller,
independent operators.<p>

<p>

No one should imagine, Bentsen says, that this amounts to a calculated drive to
the center: "It's some of those fellows out in left field who had to move." I
asked him whom he meant. He wouldn't say. "Gary Hart?" I asked. He gave me a
small grin -- a rare departure from his customary noncommittal caution. Still,
it is interesting to compare Bentsen's positions on these well-publicized
issues with some of his less famous votes. Ronnie Dugger of the <i>Texas
Observer</i> has done just that, and last September listed a dozen recent votes
in which Bentsen lined up with the other senator from Texas, the extremely
conservative John Tower. The votes included restoration of the death penalty
(both senators for) and opening up the FBI's files (both senators against). "We
know why Tower casts such votes," Dugger concluded, "but he is not running for
the Democratic nomination for President."<p>

<p>

Bentsen's smart, carefully balanced performance has not only put him in the
running with a national constituency which might otherwise have considered him
an uptown version of Russell Long, but also helped him to a position of some
respect within the Senate. Bentsen has not, in four years' time, become a
backstage titan at the Capitol, but he has won compliments from the likes of
Majority Leader Mike Mansfield ("an extremely impressive senator with a bright
future"), Minority Leader Hugh Scott ("a heavyweight"), and Spencer Rich,
congressional reporter for the Washington Post, who has written several
flattering stories with headlines like "Soft-Spoken Bentsen Gains Wide Respect
In the Senate." The most tangible evidence of his influence occurred last
summer, with the passage of the most important legislation protecting the
pension rights of employees of private companies ever enacted. For years,
similar bills had been approved by the Labor and Public Welfare Committee, and
for years they had died in the Finance Committee, but this time Bentsen -- as
an insurance man, a master of the bill's actuarial minutiae -- nursed the bill
through Finance to passage. In mid-1973, Bentsen's reputation as a "workhorse"
was beginning to spread among some of his fellow senators and he began
entertaining the notion that 1976 might be his year. To conduct his one-year
trial heat, Bentsen had two preliminary arrangements to make. The first was to
find the money -- $365,000, all of it raised at a $200-per-plate affair in
Houston late in 1973. The second was to hire a campaign staff, now working
under the direction of Ben Palumbo, a former aide to Senator Harrison Williams.
With the machinery ready, Bentsen began his test campaign, setting himself four
goals to reach by Election Day, 1974:<p>

<p>

The first, according to Palumbo, was to "make the senator a familiar
personality to the Democratic party structure nationally" -- to expose him not
to the voters, but to the party regulars. In this effort, Bentsen has made good
use of his position as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, which gave him an official reason to speak in each of the
thirty-three states where Democrats were running for the Senate.<p>

<p>

The second was to have the senator taken seriously by the national press.
Outside his home state, Bentsen has received almost no critical coverage;
recently he has been mentioned quite favorably in the Boston Globe, the New
York Times, the Chicago Sun-Times, and many others.<p>

<p>

The third was to "have him become a familiar face and personality to the
regional print and electronic media." To this end Bentsen has appeared on talk
shows across the country and has met for informal discussion with the editorial
boards of several major papers.<p>

<p>

Finally, Bentsen hoped to identify himself with economic issues -- not in the
gadfly's role, like a Galbraith or a Proxmire, but as a solid, serious
policy-maker, and as a party spokesman. Bentsen's important breakthrough in
this area occurred last July, when he convinced the Senate Democratic Policy
Committee that he should give the party's televised rebuttal to President
Nixon's economic message. It was a tub-thumping attack on Republican management
of the economy, and variations on it have become his standard speech. "I want
to talk about the price of food, about the cost of buying a house. About good
times and bad times. In short, about our national economy, and the way it
affects your household." And so he does, conjuring up the traditional specter
of the Republicans as the party of depression.<p>

<p>

As Palumbo and his staff see it, Bentsen not only hit all four of his targets,
but did so months before the deadline. Unless Bentsen is weighing factors he
has not revealed, the go-ahead is certain. While none of his campaign
strategists say he is going to win, several suggest how he could: Scoop Jackson
will keep putting his foot in his mouth and continue to lose support; the
George Wallace camp will realize that their man is a nonstarter, and will see
Bentsen as their next best hope; the Kennedy voters will disperse among the
candidates rather than swinging en masse to Mondale; the Mondale campaign will
not catch fire; and, in the middle of a split and tumultuous convention, all
eyes will turn to the cool and confident man from Texas.<p>

<p>

<p>

<br><p>

<p>

<font size=5>P</font>ERHAPS. Perhaps. Bentsen does have several undeniable advantages -- his proven
access to big money, the demonstrated efficiency of his campaign organization,
and the propitious timing of his emergence as an economic wise man. But his
several disadvantages suggest another, which is as unlucky in its timing for
Bentsen as the economic issue is fortunate. That is the vague quality known as
"character."<p>

<p>

Judgments in this area are clearly speculative and should be labeled as such.
But as our presidencies have become reigns rather than administrations, making
guesses about the character of potential Presidents seems a risk worth
taking.<p>

<p>

The difficulty in Bentsen's case is that he offers precious little for
examination. Apart from his four years in the Senate, his record consists of a
long-past, probably irrelevant interlude as a congressman, and a very recent,
very relevant half-lifetime as a businessman. Those years in Houston -- when
Bentsen aged from thirty-four to forty-nine, when he was transformed from the
hollow-cheeked boy of the congressional campaign photos into the elegant
champion of the boardroom, when he began as a millionaire's son and finished as
a millionaire himself -- must offer many clues, but the clues are hidden.<p>

<p>

From the limited evidence of Bentsen's public record, a few tentative
conclusions can be drawn. Fifteen years ago, in a discussion of the
Kennedy-Nixon race, a writer named Robert Fitch said that both candidates
exemplified the politics of the "cool cat." "The essence of the cool cat is
that he is controlled rather than committed; that is, he is self-controlled,
rather than controlled by ideals to which he has given himself." As it turned
out, of course, he was wrong about Nixon, who gave over his control not to
ideals, but to inner demons; but he was close to the truth about Kennedy, and
even closer about Bentsen. If there is a single way to characterize Bentsen's
actions in public life, it is to say that at each point his decision has been
the smart thing to do. Not necessarily the principled thing, or the brave
thing, or even the conservative thing -- although each of those terms may apply
in certain cases. Ideology, emotion, even personal pique, have taken subsidiary
places to the dispassionate logic of this modern "cool cat."<p>

<p>

Bentsen's personal bearing is in keeping with his political philosophy; it is
absolutely lucid and absolutely cold. His first words to me, as I settled down
next to him in the airplane and started asking him questions, were, "How long
is this going to take? Can we get it over with as quickly as possible?" In
public he is less abrupt: Both friends and enemies agree that on a platform and
in a crowd he is far more graceful, far less strained since he went to the
Senate than he was in the 1970 campaign. Still, as a member of his staff put
it, "I think everyone realizes he won't ever have John Connally's gift of
charming the man in the street, or Lyndon Johnson's delight in pressing the
flesh." In the course of an admittedly limited exposure to him, the one
evidence of "human" frailty I observed was his decision, after some hesitation
and with apparent regret, to have a dessert helping of cherries jubilee. The
comments of his friends -- such as they are, for he is not a man who has
intimates -- suggests that this impression was not far wrong. "Lloyd never
unwinds," says a Texan who has worked with him in politics (and who, like
nearly all of Bentsen's associates, refused to be quoted by name). "He relaxes,
of course, but his mind never loses that pitch." Another man, who has worked
with him in Congress, says, "He is <i>unencumbered</i>, by people, ideas,
anything."<p>

<p>

Bentsen's self-control is almost palpable. He does not smoke. Since coming to
Washington, according to his press secretary, Jack DeVore, he "generally
restricts his drinks to sherry." Even in his recreations -- tennis, raising
roses, collecting objets d'art -- Bentsen does not go slack. The same Texan who
says Bentsen never unwinds recalls that during the 1970 campaign, Bentsen would
scrupulously set aside his Sunday mornings for a tennis match. "He was a
ferocious competitor. He was going to beat the pants off you or know the reason
why. Now that he's in politics, he has the same determination to be the best,
to rise to the top. But if he doesn't make it, it's not going to wound him. He
knows who he is, and doesn't need political power to survive." "He has very few
hangups," says another political associate. "He doesn't judge things on the
basis of who he is supposed to be, or what his family was, or what everyone
else expects him to do. He really does judge on the facts."<p>

<p>

Such dispassion has its attractions especially for a presidential candidate. A
man not shackled to ideology might have an easier time cutting his losses than
Johnson had in Vietnam. ("Lloyd can get angry about mistakes, but he is the
first one to admit his own errors," says a member of his staff.) A man less
interested in symbolic showcases than in tangible results might pass fewer
pieces of "landmark" legislation, and instead find out how to make the laws on
the books work. A man with managerial experience as extensive as Bentsen's
might be a less easy victim of the corrupting influence of the White House
culture than previous Presidents have been. A man with as firm a sense of his
own identity and competence as Bentsen's might not be tortured, as was Nixon,
by enemies real and imagined, or distorted, as was Johnson, by notions of how a
Texan should handle the Ivy League advisers around his table. "Is it
difficult," I asked him, "to run as a Texan, when memories of LBJ are so fresh
in the public mind?" Bentsen replied, "When people meet me, they see I'm very
different."<p>

<p>

But the "cool cat" has his shortcomings too, not least because some small,
foreign element of illogic of character, remains beneath even the most
controlled exterior. Kennedy and Nixon demonstrated this in their different
ways; Kennedy with his defensive, he-man reactions in foreign policy, Nixon in
fashions too obvious to mention. It is reasonable to assume that Bentsen, too,
has a heart, that he believes in something more than he has revealed, that we
cannot judge him solely on his logic. We may not need to know what our
Presidents make for breakfast, or what clothes their children wear, but we do
deserve a look at the moral baggage they carry.<p>

	<font size=5>T</font>he season has brought us a distinct reminder of the great American triumvirate

of fame in three notable biographic works. No one of the three can be called a

great book: the subject of each dwarfs the narrative; nor can we assure

ourselves that either is likely to prove a classic; but they are all likely to

hold a place not merely till better biographies push them aside, but probably

long after writers of greater skill or more abundant opportunity have

contributed fresh estimates.<p>



<p>



The problem which confronts one who would set Franklin forth is a peculiar one.

There are three tolerably distinct Franklins. There is the man whom Priestley

knew. There is the friend of Sally Stevenson and Madame Brillon, and there is

the diplomat whom Vergennes encountered. Yet what could these accomplished men

and women of England and France know of the run-away apprentice and the

Philadelphia neighbor? Mr. McMaster has found enough to say about Franklin as a

man of letters; Mr. Morse has included him in his series of American Statesmen;

[See Endnote 1] if the new Riverside Science Series is to include biographies,

there could be no fitter subject than Franklin; and if American Religious

Leaders is comprehensive enough to take in men who have been eminent as

philanthropists or who have strongly affected the moral sense of Americans,

there would be no impropriety in placing Franklin in a group which holds

Jonathan Edwards and Theodore Parker.<p>



<p>



Mr. Morse recognizes this comprehensiveness of Franklin, and the limitations

under which he presents him. "Mr. Parton," he says, "has given us such an

admirable biography, so exhaustive and so remarkably happy in setting the real

man vividly before the reader, that I feel that I must give something between a

reason and an apology for the existence of this volume. The fact is simply

this: without a life of Franklin this series would have appeared as absurdly

imperfect as a library of English fiction with Scott or Thackeray absent from

the shelves. The volume was a necessity; and since Mr. Parton's work, even if

it could be borrowed or stolen, would not fit the space, this little book has

been written. No poor genie of Oriental magic was ever squeezed into more

disproportionately narrow quarters than is Franklin in these four hundred

pages; but again necessity must bear the burden of responsibility." It is very

clear to the reader that Mr. Morse frankly accepted the conditions under which

he was compelled to work. He was not writing a life of Benjamin Franklin; he

was answering the question, What part did Franklin play as a statesman, both on

the stage of the colonial development and in the broader theatre of

international politics? He has compressed into fifty pages all the interesting

period of Franklin's history which to the general biographer is peculiarly

important--the period of formation of character and of incipient public life;

and more than once he is obliged, with manifest regrets to forego the pleasure

of following Franklin's course minutely, because the subject is not intimately

connected with Franklin's statesmanship. He has even generously condensed his

account of the final treaty operations in Paris, out of regard for the writer

who is engaged upon Jay in the Statesmen Series.<p>



<p>



Although Mr. Morse has been faithful thus to the strict demands of his theme,

he has by no means produced a fragmentary work. He has recognized very clearly

the necessity of showing the foundation upon which were built the great

structure of Franklin's public life; and his early chapters, in which he deals

with the conditions of Franklin's growth and with the fundamental qualities of

character, are admirable for their compact, forcible presentation of this

important part of his subject. Moreover, his free, sensible view of

statesmanship as something more than officialism has led him to regard

Franklin's general influence over his countrymen as an integral part of his

theme, so that after all the only Franklin who is conspicuously absent from the

book is Franklin the physicist. The narrative gains in vigor by the necessity

of compression, and Mr. Morse's attitude is one of such frank yet impartial

admiration as to give the reader an agreeable confidence in his candor and

fairness. <p>



<p>



The book is a vigorous one, and will materially help the student in American

history to understand the very important part of the struggle for nationality

which was going on at Paris during the time when Englishmen were fighting each

other in America. Mr. Morse says, with great force: "We read about the horrors

of the winter camp at Valley Forge, and we shudder at all the details of the

vivid picture. The anxiety, the toil, the humiliation, which Franklin endured

for many winters and many summers in Paris, in sustaining the national credit,

do not make a picture, do not furnish material for a readable chapter in

history; yet many a man would far rather have faced Washington's lot than

Franklin's."<p>



<p>



Mr. Lodge may be said to have had somewhat the same problem before him, and to

have indulged his personal taste a little more in the work which he has written

on George Washington [See Endnote 2] for the Statesmen Series. It would not be

just to say that Washington as a statesman occupies one of the two volumes

devoted to him, and Washington as a soldier the other, but it is quite evident

that if Mr. Lodge had been willing to confine himself to a study of Washington

as a statesman he could have compressed his work into a single volume. We think

such a course would not only have made his book a fitter member of a series,

but would have enhanced its value; for it would have enabled the author to

expend his strength upon that part of the subject where his work is strongest,

and where he comes least into comparison with writers of general history. A

large part of Mr. Lodge's first volume is necessarily a recapitulation of

familiar facts in the history of the war for independence.<p>



<p>



Dismissing, however, all consideration of the book which Mr. Lodge did not

choose to write, and asking only how far he has succeeded in writing a

deliberate life of Washington, independent of any series, we can take genuine

pleasure in so spirited a piece of work. It can scarcely be called a critical

biography. There is little evidence that Mr. Lodge has searched for his

material beyond the nearest and most tangible documents. It is rather the work

of a man at home in the general field of American history, who is impressed

with the importance of this single figure, and finds the subject a convenient

one also for carrying more or less comment on politics in general. He sets

about his task, moreover, with an apostolic zeal which detracts from his power

as a biographer. His position would have been stronger if he had not felt it

necessary to divest his readers of possible false views respecting Washington.

We doubt if the persons who take up his book will, as a rule, bring to the

reading an artificial conception of Washington; and Mr. Lodge, by the fervor

with which he continually sets up the ninepins of false Washingtons in order to

bowl them over, may leave in the minds of some an uneasy apprehension lest his

hero was as priggish, as cold, as hard, and as unlovable as so-called popular

notions make him out to be. He doth protest too much. If Mr. Lodge, assuming a

tolerably common acquaintance with the history in which Washington was so

commanding a figure, had expended his strength in setting Washington forth

clearly and humanly, ignoring the necessity of combating false views in set

terms, he might have made a book less like a tractate, and more like a piece of

literature. <p>



<p>



In saying this we are simply expressing the superiority of constructive

biography over polemical treatises. Mr. Lodge shows so clearly that he

understands Washington, he has so acute a judgment when dealing with the public

questions by which Washington was tested, that he might easily have rested his

case upon a luminous statement of the situation; the strength of his position

would have been such, and he would have been so sure of the general sympathy of

his readers, that the laborious defense which he makes might well have been

spared. Much that he says again and again and reiterates in a summary is

interesting, but somewhat superfluous. The conclusions which he reaches should

have been the conclusions of his years of study, and have formed the reason for

his book: lying in his mind, they might have given point to his interpretation

of Washington's life; published, they tend to draw the reader away from

Washington to a consideration of what Mr. Lodge thinks about Washington.

Washington is a very great subject,--too great to serve as a saddle for a

rider.<p>



<p>



For current reading, however, this work is unmistakably interesting, and as

criticism which is necessarily temporary it will serve most excellent ends. In

fact, it is so close to the time that the reader fresh from recent political

lessons will occasionally read passages which serve as footnotes to

contemporary history. How capital, for example, is this characterization of

party methods in the early days of the republic! "Jefferson knew that Hamilton

and all who fought with him were as sincerely in favor of a republic as he

himself was; but his unerring genius in political management told him that he

could never raise a party or make a party-cry out of the statement that, while

he favored a democratic republic, the men to whom he was opposed preferred one

of a more aristocratic caste. It was necessary to have something much more

highly seasoned than this. So he took the ground that his opponents were

monarchists, bent on establishing a monarchy in this country, and were backed

by a 'corrupt squadron' in Congress in the pay of the treasury. This was of

course utter rubbish, but it served its purpose admirably. Jefferson, indeed,

shouted these cries so much that he almost came to believe in them, and

sympathetic writers of this day repeat them as if they had reality, instead of

having been mere noise to frighten the unwary." Mr. Lodge could not have

written more to the point if he had been describing the tactics of extreme

party men of this day when screaming "free-trade" and "British gold" at every

one who thinks it time to overhaul the war-tariff. And when one comes upon such

a passage as this: " He [Washington] was as far removed as possible from that

highly virtuous and very ineffective class of persons who will not support

anything that is not perfect, and who generally contrive to do more harm than

all the avowed enemies of sound government,"--rather odd result to proceed from

a "very ineffective" class--one, pleased with the subtleties of historical

research, might set himself to calculating the date when Mr. Lodge penned the

sentence. We wish, by the way, that while he was engaged in annotating 1789

with 1889 he had had more to say about Washington's views on office-seekers and

appointments to office. There is a letter of the President's which cannot be

quoted too often. It will be long before it is hackneyed.<p>



<p>



We are disposed to think that the most valuable contribution which Mr. Lodge

has made to the Washington literature is in the interpretation which he has

made of the facts of our history which throw light upon the personality of

Washington. His account, for example, of the Virginian aristocracy is

altogether admirable, and helps to an appreciation of the elements which

combined in the education of Washington. He could not be called a man of the

people in the sense that Jackson was, or Lincoln; and this, we suspect, lies at

the bottom of the loose statements, which Mr. Lodge controverts with good

reason and some heat, that Washington was an English country gentleman rather

that an American. He belonged in the governing class, and in that division of

the class which had come to its fullest maturity. When America broke away from

the British Empire, there were in the chief towns representatives of the

British governing class; but in Virginia a governing class had been formed on

the soil out of the conditions of life, unaffected to any considerable degree

by the direct interposition of British influence. It was therefore a native,

and not a foreign element in American life. The foreign aristocratic element

broke off from America when the schism came: the Boston and New York Tories

went to Halifax and to England when they could; the native aristocratic element

was and remained sturdily American.<p>



<p>



Mr. Lodge is led to assert the Americanism of Washington in reply to statements

that Lincoln was the first American, and the passage is interesting to us here

and now, because it brings together the three names before us. He has been

quoting Mr. Clarence King's prefatory note to Hay and Nicolay's Life of

Lincoln, in which occurs the sentence: "Abraham Lincoln was the first American

to reach the lonely height of immortal fame. Before him, within the narrow

compass of our history, were but two preeminent names,--Columbus the

discoverer, and Washington the founder; the one an Italian seer, the other an

English country gentleman." His reply is worth giving at some length:--<p>



<p>



"In order to point his sentence and prove his first postulate, Mr. King is

obliged not only to dispose of Washington, but to introduce Columbus, who was

never was imagined in the wildest fantasy to be an American, and to omit

Franklin. The omission of itself is fatal to Mr. King's case. Franklin has

certainly a 'preeminent name.' He has, too, 'immortal fame,' although of course

of a widely different character from that of either Washington or Lincoln, but

he was a great man in the broad sense of a world-wide reputation. Yet no one

has ever ventured to call Benjamin Franklin an Englishman. He was a colonial

American, of course, but he was as intensely an American as any man who has

lived on this continent before or since. A man of the people, he was American

by the character of his genius, by his versatility, the vivacity of his

intellect, and his mental dexterity. In his abilities, his virtues, and his

defects he was an American, and so plainly one has to be beyond the reach of

doubt or question....Unless one is prepared to set Franklin down as an

Englishman, which would be as reasonable as to say that Daniel Webster was a

fine example of the Slavic race, it must be admitted that it was possible for

the colonies to produce in the eighteenth century a genuine American who won

immortal fame. If they could produce one of one type, they could produce a

second of another type, and there was, therefore, nothing inherently impossible

in existing conditions to prevent Washington from being an American. Lincoln

was undoubtedly the first great American of his type, but that is not the only

type of American. It is one which, as bodied forth in Abraham Lincoln, commands

the love and veneration of the people of the United States, and the admiration

of the world wherever his name is known. To the noble and towering greatness of

his mind and character it does not add one hair's breadth to say that he was

the first American, or that he was of a common or uncommon type. Greatness like

Lincoln's is far beyond such qualifications, and least of all is it necessity

to his fame to push Washington from his birthright."<p>



<p>



Mr. Lodge's stout defense of Washington's Americanism is accented throughout

the book by a bitterness of tone toward England, as if one could not be a good

American without hating England. Our criticism upon this feature is that it

comes perilously near personal feeling, and the sympathies or antipathies of an

historical writer regarding a great nation are of no importance to his readers.

The personal feeling which we can value and which counts in the work is that

which the author has for his subject, and it is refreshing to find so hearty

and loyal an admiration as Mr. Lodge has for Washington. An impassive,

scientific judgment would have gone far toward corroborating the opinions of

those who have regarded Washington as a dull, cold man. When a biographer like

Mr. Lodge is stirred by is subject, he has won half the battle in persuading

his readers that Washington inspired his contemporaries with personal affection

and admiration.<p>



<p>



The life of Lincoln [See Endnote 3] which Mr. Herndon has prepared, with Mr.

Weik's aid, is by no means so satisfactory a piece of work as either of the two

books which we have been considering, but its very absence of form will strike

the reader as an evidence of its genuineness; and as a contribution to history

it is more important than Mr. Morse's Franklin or Mr. Lodge's Washington, since

the establishment of a true conception of an historic figure is of more

consequence than the careful re-statement of a received view or the correction

of popular errors. We think we are not mistaken in looking upon Herndon's

Lincoln as a most timely and valuable contribution to a just understanding of

that great man, even though much of it in a preliminary form appears to have

found a place originally in Lamon's Life. Considered only as a memoir pour

servir, it is of unmistakable service. It bears the marks of patient and

painstaking labor in gathering all the facts regarding Lincoln's origin and

early years; and when the reader considers that Mr. Herndon was Lincoln's law

partner for twenty years; that he made his acquaintance as far back as 1837;

that he lived amongst Lincoln's early companions, and, so to speak, spoke the

Illinois language, it is easy to see how important may be his testimony. In

addition, the open-minded reader can scarcely read this artless book without

feeling a growing confidence in Mr. Herndon's honesty and accuracy. The very

offenses against good taste show him to be a good witness, and we do not see

how any student of Lincoln's character, and especially any one who undertakes

hereafter to set Lincoln forth, can avoid being strongly affected by this

work.<p>



<p>



That the book is likely to have a general circulation, unless among the

President's old neighbors, we are not quite ready to believe, though it will

have many charms for educated readers through the very homeliness of the

narrative. Nor is it the homeliness alone, but often a graphic touch, which

will arrest the attention. Here is a passage, for instance. relating to

Lincoln's loneliness in domestic life:--<p>



<p>



"Mr. Lincoln never had a confidant, and therefore never unbosomed himself to

others. He never spoke of his trials to me, or so far as I knew, to any of his

friends. It was a great burden to carry, but he bore it sadly enough and

without a murmur. I could always realize when he was in distress, without

being, told. He was not exactly an early riser,--that is, he never usually

appeared at the office till about nine o'clock in the morning. I usually

preceded him an hour. Sometimes, however, he would come down as early as seven

o'clock,--in fact, on one occasion I remember he came down before daylight. If,

on arriving at the office, I found him in, I knew instantly that a breeze had

sprung up over the domestic sea, and that the waters were troubled. He would

either be lying on the lounge, looking skyward, or doubled up in a chair, with

his feet resting on the sill of a back window. He would not look up on my

entering, and only answered my 'Good-morning' with a grunt. I at once busied

myself with pen and paper, or ran through the leaves of some book; but the

evidence of his melancholy and distress was so plain and his silence so

significant, that I would grow restless myself, and, finding some excuse to go

to the court-house or elsewhere, would leave the room. <p>



<p>



"The door of the office opening into a narrow hallway was half glass, with a

curtain on it working on brass rings strung on wire. As I passed out on these

occasions I would draw the curtain across the glass, and before I reached the

bottom of the stairs I could hear the key turn in the lock, and Lincoln was

alone in the gloom. An hour in the clerk's office at the court-house, an hour

longer in a neighboring store, having passed, I would return. By that time

either a client had dropped in, and Lincoln was propounding the law, or else

the cloud of despondency had passed away, and he was busy in the recital of an

Indiana story to whistle off the recollections of the morning's gloom. Noon

having arrived, I would depart homeward for my dinner. Returning within an

hour, I would find him still in the office,--although his house stood but a few

squares away,--lunching on a slice of cheese and a handful of crackers, which,

in my absence he had brought up from a store below. Separating for the day at

five or six o'clock in the evening, I would still leave him behind, either

sitting on a box at the foot of the stairway, entertaining a few loungers, or

killing time in the same way on the court-house steps. A light in the office

after dark attested his presence there till late along in the night, when,

after all the world had gone to sleep, the tall form of the man destined to be

the nation's President could have been seen strolling along in the shadows of

trees and buildings, and quietly slipping in through the door of a modest frame

house, which it pleased the world, in a conventional way, to call his home."<p>



<p>



Some of the incidents in this life will not be pleasant reading to those who

have already constructed a Lincoln after their own imagination, and are loath

to give up the shadow for the reality. But to those who wish to know the truth,

at whatever cost to illusions, this work will come laden with many suggestions.

It will play a large part, we are confident, in the future construction of

Lincoln in the minds of men, and we suspect that it will have one significant

effect. There is a disposition, expressed by Mr. Lodge, to speak of Lincoln as

a typical American, or a typical Western American. Mr. Herndon's report will go

far toward accenting those characteristics of Lincoln which set him by himself,

and bring into high relief his marked personality, his uniqueness.<p>



<p>



We do not suppose the time will ever come when new lives of Franklin,

Washington, and Lincoln will not be offered to American readers: a few new

facts will come to light, the point of view will shift, the audience will

change, new forms of biographic writing and new manners in literature will

arise; but, above all, these three names will always contain an inspiration,

and so long as a nation lives its interest in the great characters it has

produced will be undying. Buildings crumble, battle-fields become populated,

but art in letters and character in persons survive. And of these two,

character is the more indestructible; so that it is even possible to care for

Emerson's genius in his poems because of our admiration for his fine

personality, while some later poet may speak a language more intelligible and

more harmonious.<p>



<p>



We can understand through these men how a people relying on tradition, and not

on historical records, can come to elevate their heroes into demigods, and

invest them with attributes taken from the entire series of events with which

they were identified. Franklin thus becomes the personification of an

optimistic shrewdness, a large, healthy nature, as of a young people gathering

its strength and feeling its broadening power; Washington is the serene hero,

undismayed by the failure of the hour, always confident in the success of the

event; Lincoln, the sacrifice for national sin, and thus the bringer-in of

national regeneration. But the clear light of a truth perpetually made more

free from misconception is better than the most highly imagined myth, when

character is in question; and every new historical writer who bends his

endeavor to get at the exact truth regarding Franklin, Washington, or Lincoln

is contributing to the slow building of just conceptions regarding men who are

at once the highest product of national forces and the deepest foundation of

national character.<p>



<p>



The most interesting outcome of the celebration of Washington's inauguration,

last spring, was the evidence that it elicited of the power which Washington's

name possessed. No one need despair of the republic so long as that name can be

uttered as a rebuke and instantly arrest the public attention. Mr. Lodge may

disabuse his mind of the fear that an artificial Washington has been

constructed in the popular imagination. The figure which rises to the mind is

both lofty and human. Thus, too, physiologists may refer Lincoln's melancholy

to a disordered liver, and Mr. Herndon may weakly imagine that he was forever

brooding over his obscure origin; but the mournful, sad-eyed man who

represented the nation in the hour of its agony has become too well known in

the hearts of Americans to recede into narrower limits. With equal justice the

people have learned to accept Franklin for what he was; not to ignore or

disregard the complacency with which he looked back upon the mean morality of

his youth, but to value the cheerfulness of his philosophy, and to see in his

good citizenship the essential basis of that broad love of one's neighbor which

a democratic republic always must regard as a prime requisite in its 

members.<p>

	<i><font size=4>With this essay the Atlantic

begins a series of biographical papers each of which will discuss that time of

supreme crisis, that turning point, when a man's fortunes were made or lost.

DOUGLAS SOUTHALL FREEMAN, the leading historian of the South, knows more about

George Washington than any other man alive. Ten years ago he began laying the

foundation for his great biography, four volumes of which have already

appeared, with a fifth announced for this autumn. Mr. Freeman, affectionately

known as the Sage of Richmond, was for thirty-four years the editor of the

Richmond News Leader, but at his busiest he never ceased to work at his

monumental life of Robert E. Lee for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in

1934. He knew the turning point in Lee's career, and he now singles out with

fresh illumination the hardest decision General Washington ever made.</i></font><p>

	<font size=5>T</font>he time had come when the General felt that he could resign without disservice

to his country. Sir Guy Carleton's last transport had left New York. Not a

British soldier remained on the soil of the United States elsewhere than at the

western posts from which it was assumed the garrisons soon would be withdrawn.

The peace treaty contained explicit admission of American independence; the

alliance with France was firm. Command of what remained of the Continental Army

could be transferred safely to Henry Knox, former Chief of Artillery.<p>



<p>



So, on the 23rd of December, 1783, Washington appeared before Congress at

Annapolis, Maryland, and in ceremonies made tense by their complete simplicity,

he read a brief address that concluded with these words: "Having finished the

work assigned me, I retire from the great theatre of action; and bidding an

affectionate farewell to this august body under whose orders I have so long

acted, I here offer my commission, and take my leave of all the employments of

public life." With that he drew the folded paper from his pocket, stepped

forward, placed the document in the hands of President Thomas Mifflin; and as

soon afterwards as courtesy allowed, he mounted his waiting horse and started

for Mount Vernon.<p>



<p>



He knew he was a national hero. Had not Congress voted him an equestrian

statue? When later he asked for his commission as a souvenir, was there not

talk of returning it to him in a gold casket? Glen who had witnessed all the

discouragements and defeats of war from 1775 to Yorktown in 1781 believed that

his energy, his resolution, his leadership had carried the cause to victory,

and they did not begrudge any honor or withhold applause of any apostrophe the

most imaginative of their orators could fashion.<p>



<p>



The General was honored not less for what he was than for what he had

accomplished, because the people of the United States realized that in dealing

with Congress, with jealous subordinates, and with some difficult men among the

fine corps of officers France had sent to America, he had displayed a patience

and a candor that had behind them unshakable integrity. Washington was alone on

his pedestal of public acclamation. Survivors of his campaigns mentioned his

name gratefully and then paused before they spoke of anyone else, even of

Nathanael Greene, who had conducted a magnificent campaign with a small force

on the other front.<p>



<p>



This distinction in the public mind was the one the retiring Commander-in-Chief

most desired and most cherished. The day before he said farewell to Congress,

he told the authorities of Annapolis that he had the "greatest of earthly

rewards: the approbation and affections of a free people"; and when he had been

home a month he wrote that he was "made extremely happy by the gratitude of my

countrymen." Others might seek the prize their ambition coveted; the good

opinion of the country repaid him for eight years' neglect of his private

affairs. He would not trade principles for popularity but he wanted to preserve

his position at any honorable price. Although he never quite persuaded himself

that it was possible to escape all criticism, he confessed later to Arthur

Young: "I have studiously avoided, as much as was in my power, to give any

cause for ill-natured or impertinent comments on my conduct."<p>



<p>



The surest means to these ends obviously was to keep away from political

contention. He would continue to love his country and to rejoice in its

progress, but he had lived his day. "I shall view the busy world," he told one

of his French comrades, "in the calm light of philosophy and with that serenity

of mind which the soldier in his pursuit of glory, and the statesman of fame,

have not time to enjoy." He went further: "I am not only retired from all

public employments, but I am retiring within myself and shall tread the private

walks of life with heartfelt satisfaction." To his beloved Lafayette, his son

in the spirit, he wrote almost exuberantly: "Envious of none, I am determined

to be pleased with all; and this, my dear friend, being the order of my march,

I will move gently down the stream of life until I sleep with my fathers."<p>



<p>



<p>



<font size=4><b>2.</font></b><p>



<p>



Retirement did not bring leisure. His antebellum debts remained; bonds and

mortgages due him had not been collected or had been paid, usually, in

depreciated currency; he heard that lands on the Ohio which he had patented

with every safeguard of law were being offered for sale in Philadelphia and

even in Europe as the property of other men; inquiries of every sort came to

him by post; guests, sometimes a dozen of them at a time, enjoyed his viands

and drank his Madeira, while their servants gorged in his quarters and their

horses munched his corn because he lived in a district that boasted no inn to

care for visitors' attendants and mounts. Almost a year and a half elapsed

before he had a single dinner alone with his wife. With Mount Vernon crowded

week after week, Washington counted himself fortunate if he could devote

himself to business during the morning and discharge his duties as host during

the afternoon.<p>



<p>



Public service gnawed many hours. Some estates of which he had been executor in

1770 still were unsettled; trusteeships continued; his interest in the

development of the West made him a willing leader in a movement to improve the

navigation of the upper Potomac, and when a company was organized to link this

eastern river with the watershed of the Ohio, he became its president. Even if

financial difficulty and busy occupation denied him the contemplative ease he

had thought he would have, life at Mount Vernon was as close to the fulfillment

of his dreams as a practical man could have expected. With himself the sole

loser by possible mistakes of judgment, Washington did not have to display the

public "care and caution " that had been the vigilant law of his anxious life

in the Army. There could be on the plantation no Thomas Conway to scoff at his

management, no Charles Lee to revile him, no Horatio Gates to hold suspiciously

at arm's length. Decisions about crops and cattle did not incense Governors or

arouse Delegates in Congress.<p>



<p>



For a short time, Washington had optimism, curbed but confident, for the future

of the Union. "Everything, my dear Trumbull," he wrote a former secretary,

"will come right at last, as we have often prophesied; my only fear is that we

shall lose a little reputation first." He told Governor Benjamin Harrison, his

long-time spokesman in Congress: "Like a young heir, come a little prematurely

to a large inheritance, we shall wanton and run riot until we have brought our

reputation to the brink of ruin, and then, like him, shall have to labor with

the current of opinion, when COMPELLED perhaps, to do what prudence and common

policy pointed out, as plain as any problem in Euclid, in the first

instance."<p>



<p>



Before many months, the theorem was confused. The gradual economic recovery of

some parts of the country was less apparent from the seclusion of Mount Vernon

than was the political bewilderment of public men. Ugly rivalries developed

among the States; Congress manifestly needed more powers than it had, but it

would not exercise those it possessed; the considerable volume of specie left

in America by French and British was hoarded or sent overseas for needed goods;

a depreciated currency was a dragging ball and chain whenever a forward step

was made; British commercial policy appeared inflexibly hostile.<p>



<p>



Washington tried to view this philosophically in the private letters he wrote.

Over and over he remarked that the people "must feel before they will see," but

he found even his tightly woven patience raveling. "Illiberality, jealousy, and

local policy mix too much," he warned, "in all our public councils, for the

good government of the Union." In the dispute over the grant to Congress of

powers to raise revenue and to regulate commerce, he did not pretend to be a

nonpartisan, though he made no public statement. "If we are afraid to trust one

another under qualified powers," he insisted, "there is an end of the Union."

In another communication his argument was: "We are either a united people or we

are not. If the former, let us, in all matters of general concern act as a

nation....If we are not, let us no longer act a farce by pretending to it."<p>



<p>



This letter was written to the Virginia Congressman, James Madison, thirty four

years of age, for whose discerning accounts of public events Washington was

grateful. Most of the General's older friends in public life were dead or

feeble, preoccupied with their own affairs or concerned chiefly with the

politics of their State. Exchange of views with the Adamses, with Franklin, and

with Hancock never had been frequent. Patrick Henry, Richard Henry Lee, and

even Philip Schuyler now wrote seldom. Most of those sending information to

Mount Vernon or seeking his advice on political questions were men, such as

Alexander Hamilton and Henry Knox, who had been too young to participate in the

colonial juntas and too busy with arms during the war to share conspicuously in

the organization of the State governments. Washington enjoyed and extended this

correspondence. Of his 159 political letters written to Americans in four and a

quarter years at home after the war, 76 were addressed to one or another of

seven men, all of them in their twenties or thirties. Without the least

intention of doing so, Washington speedily became the leader of a company of

young men more interested in the Union than in the individual States.<p>



<p>



Washington's own opinion of the States was being lowered by every delay on

their part in voting to Congress the power to raise revenue with which to

revive public credit. The danger that America would lose the reputation she had

won in the war made him forget on occasion his resolution to give no cause for

"ill-natured comments." "My opinion," he said almost angrily in May, 1786, "is

that there is more wickedness than ignorance in the conduct of the States." He

concluded unhappily: "The want of disposition to do justice is the source of

the national embarrassments. It was not necessary to specify. Unwillingness to

pay taxes, suspicion of government in general and particularly of Federal

government, the selfish jealousy of rival States, and an alarming increase in

every sort of vicious economic cheating that promised temporary gain--these

were hampering the recovery of America and were too widespread for Washington

to spend time in describing them to correspondents who battled daily with the

base realities.<p>



<p>



He began to think that the men who formed the American Confederation "probably

had," as he put it, "too good an opinion of human nature," and he confessed his

concern over a situation he did not think he could improve. "Having happily

assisted," he said, "in bringing the ship into port, and having been fairly

discharged, it is not my business to embark again on a sea of troubles." He

continued: "Nor could it be expected that my sentiments and opinions would have

much weight on the minds of my countrymen; they have been neglected, though,

given as a last legacy in the most solemn manner. I had then perhaps some

claims to public attention. I consider myself as having none at present."<p>



<p>



<p>



<font size=4><b>3.</font></b><p>



<p>



Events of the summer and autumn of 1786 seemed to confirm all Washington's

fears for the future of the Union. Bitter loss and perilous sliding on the very

brink of financial chaos had not convinced the country that a surfeit of paper

money was worse than a shortage of specie. Seven States yielded to the

temptation and started the presses again. Rhode Island outdid them all by

voting to issue any needy freeholder paper currency equal in nominal value to

half the estimated value of his real estate, the only security behind the

bills. This currency was made legal tender for the payment of all debts. If a

creditor refused it, the debtor could deposit the bills with the court and

procure his discharge. Any person who declined to accept this paper money in

current purchase and sale was liable to arrest and fine. If, as a few

courageous leaders warned, the result of this emission of depreciating paper

was relief for the poor debtor and ruin for the well-to-do creditor, this was

considered by many as precisely what should come to pass. All had shared in

saving property during the war; they should divide equally what had been

preserved. To Washington it seemed as if the controlling faction in Rhode

Island were burning down the homes of all, but he said, half bitterly, "there

are combustibles in every State, which a spark might set fire to." Shays'

Rebellion in western Massachusetts alarmed him, if possible, still more.

Anxiously he wrote to inquire whether the insurgents had a just grievance that

should be corrected; and if they had no excuse for their acts, he wished to

know what Massachusetts intended to do to vindicate its courts and its laws.<p>



<p>



Until this time Washington had abandoned his detached position to the extent

only that he had spoken sternly in private letters of men and of policies that

threatened to ruin the country's credit and to destroy the Union. Now, in

answer to his inquiries, his friends had to suggest that he do more than write.

David Humphreys knew how earnestly his old chief wished to continue in

retirement, but in describing to the General the state of affairs in New

England, the former military secretary gave this unpleasant advice: "In case of

civil discord, I have already told you that it was seriously my opinion that

you could not remain neuter, and that you would be obliged, in self-defense, to

take part on one side or the other, or withdraw from the Continent. Your

friends are of the same opinion." Word was sent, also, that Congress might ask

him to come to New York to counsel the discouraged Delegates; James Madison had

received intimation that it would be desirable for Washington to make a

"private visit" to New England if conditions grew worse, as some of his

correspondents believed they inevitably would. "We are all," Light-Horse Harry

Lee wrote his old leader, "in dire apprehension that a beginning of anarchy

with all its calamities has approached and [we] have no means to stop the

dreadful work." Washington himself said, "I shall be surprised at nothing, for

if, three years since, any person had told me that at this day I should see

such a formidable rebellion against the laws and constitutions of our own

making as now appears, I should have thought him a bedlamite, a fit subject for

a mad house."<p>



<p>



Benjamin Lincoln routed Shays' insurrectionists in January-February, 1787, and

deferred, if he did not render unnecessary, a call for the former

Commander-in-Chief to take the field, but the Massachusetts general could not

destroy the contagion of unrest. Madison confessed a fear that discontent still

was spreading. Washington thought the spring of 1787 would witness events that

would "astonish world." If this was to be prevented and a score of other

dangers averted, the Federal government must be strong enough to raise money

and to enforce law. Unless these things were done, the Union would cease to

exist. It could not live on sentiment or by sufferance. The Revolution was

played out, the spirit of '76 was gone. Most of Washington's correspondents and

native guests were of one mind on all this. The speediest rescue, they agreed,

would be through the revision of the Articles of Confederation, but in what

manner should this be undertaken? From what quarter could strength be mustered

to overcome the hostility of those who lived in the illusion their States could

survive though the Union perished? <p>



<p>



The answer was not as complex as the question made it appear. A demand had been

taking shape for a convention of the States. The proceedings of the Annapolis

convention, attended by several of Washington's most devoted political

lieutenants, had pointed the way. If a body of the ablest men of the entire

country met and exchanged views, their recommendations for changes in the

Articles might be approved. The proviso was a most important part of the plan.

Any success that attended the work of a new convention would depend, among

other things, on the representation of all the States, and on the standing and

equipment of the men who were put forward--small men, small issue.<p>



<p>



Favorable action by Congress on the call for a convention and the election of

Delegates by all the States except Rhode Island came quickly and presented a

new problem to the old soldier, whose hounds in full cry made finer music, he

thought, than even that of General Saint-Simon's band at Yorktown. Instead of

having the prospect of continuing the daily delights of rural life and all the

pleasures of experimenting with seed and trees from far countries, Washington

might be required to return to the realm of wrangle: the Virginia General

Assembly had named him unanimously as one of the State's representatives at the

Federal Convention, which was to meet in Philadelphia early in May.<p>



<p>



His supporters were divided over the "yes" or "no" of his acceptance. James

Madison insisted that Virginia could not spare Washington from her delegation

and that gloom would engulf the enterprise in his absence. Edmund Randolph,

then Governor, and Henry Lee were equally urgent. Henry Knox was doubtful.

Washington, he said, would be elected president of the convention if he

attended, with the result that "the proceedings...will more immediately be

appropriated to you than to any other person." Knox concluded: "Were the

convention to propose only amendments and patchwork to the present defective

constitution, your reputation would in a degree suffer." Conversely, the

proposal over Washington's signature of an "energetic and judicious system"

would be "highly honorable to your fame...and doubly entitle you to the

glorious republican epithet, The Father of your Country." David Humphreys was

cautious, almost pessimistic: "What chance is there...that entire unanimity

will prevail? Should this be the fact, however, would not the several members,

as it were, pledge themselves for the execution of their system? And would not

this inevitably launch you again on a sea of politics?...I have heard few

express any sanguine expectations concerning the successful issue of the

meeting, and I think not one has judged it eligible for you to attend."<p>



<p>



<p>



<font size=4><b>4.</b></font><p>



<p>



Washington's inclination was to accept Humphreys's view. Previously the General

had notified the Society of the Cincinnati that he would not attend its

meeting, which was to be held in Philadelphia about the time the Federal

Convention assembled. It might seem rude, if not insincere, to decline to sit

with his old officers and then to appear in the same town as a member of

another body. Besides, he was having rheumatic pains and could not conveniently

be absent from his plantations at the wheat harvest. On the other hand, the

life of the Union depended on revitalizing its organic law. If this could be

done at the proposed convention, "it would," he said, "be an honorable

employment," but if the convention were small and restricted to easy amendment,

then, he said frankly, "I should not like to be a sharer in this business."

Still again, he wondered whether his absence from the convention might not be

considered, as he phrased it, "dereliction to republicanism." Even worse

motives, which he did not specify, might be attributed to him.<p>



<p>



The choice was difficult, but in the end the pressure of his friends and the

prospect of the attendance of leading men in considerable number induced him to

accept appointment and to start promptly for Philadelphia. When the convention

was organized, he was unanimously elected president, as Henry Knox had

predicted, and in that position he was spared a direct share in debates for

which he was not well-equipped. His presence meant more than his vote, though

he went on record for a strong executive and for a lower House of Congress in

which there could be a Representative for as few as 30,000 voters. He was

willing, too, to have the constitution become effective when seven States

approved it, and he did not value the good opinion of all honest men so highly

that he withheld denunciation of those who refused to participate in efforts to

give America a respectable and responsible government.<p>



<p>



Rhode Island's absence from the convention outraged him. That State, he said

privately, "still perseveres in that impolitic, unjust and, one might add

without much impropriety, scandalous conduct which seems to have marked all her

public councils of late." Empty argument on the floor, fruitless debate over

trifles, angered him further. For a time, he almost despaired of a favorable

outcome, and, he confided to Alexander Hamilton, "do therefore repent having

had any agency in the business." He went on: "The men who oppose a strong and

energetic government are, in my opinion, narrow-minded politicians, or are

under the influence of local views."<p>



<p>



The document that finally was placed before him for signature contained a few

provisions he disliked and many that he approved. His judgment both of the

constitution and of the country's needs made him favor ratification: but was it

necessary that he publicly say so? He had stepped out of retirement in the

emergency and had taken the risk of being denounced as a partisan: could he not

return to his position as the impartial friend of all right-minded men? The

constitution, he wrote Lafayette, "is now a child of fortune, to be fostered by

some and buffeted by others." Then he said, "What will be the general opinion

on, or the reception of it, is not for me to decide, nor shall I say anything

for or against it; if it be good, I suppose it will work its way good; if bad,

it will recoil on the framers."<p>



<p>



Washington's old neighbor, Colonel George Mason, draftsman of the Virginia

Declaration of Rights and a member of the delegation to the convention, had

begun to assail parts of the constitution before he had left Philadelphia.

Patrick Henry aligned himself against ratification. So did Richard Henry Lee.

The incurably suspicious Arthur Lee, youngest brother of Richard Henry, was of

opinion that what others termed "errors" in the constitution were a deliberate

scheme to create an oligarchy. Washington thought the arguments of these men

were feeble, shortsighted objections to the best system of government on which

it had been possible to reach agreement. The moment the constitution was

assailed, his experience in dealing with an impotent Congress and with selfish

States made him the champion of the new plan. He left the detailed argument to

Madison, to Hamilton, and to others scarcely less astute; but almost without

regard to its effect on his reputation as a man who stood apart from the

political controversies of the time, he opened correspondence with supporters

of the constitution in all the States where he had friends of influence and he

continued eagerly to follow the deliberations of all the State conventions.

They absorbed much of his thought in the winter of 1787-88 and the following

spring.<p>



<p>



Nowhere did the heat of contest rise more quickly or the fires of debate flame

more furiously than in Virginia, where Washington and the other supporters of

an adequate Federal government had to face the persistent opposition of Patrick

Henry, who was fully aroused and at the head of a powerful following. It was

manifest early in 1788 that ratification or rejection of the constitution in

the Old Dominion would be by a narrow margin. Washington took up his pen with

much awkwardness but he wielded it as vigorously as if it had been a sword,

though in one instance only, and then by mistake, did his letters get into

print.<p>



<p>



Without excessive risk and opposition, the constitution received the favorable

vote of nine States. When Virginia became the tenth in June, 1788, by a

disagreeably narrow majority of ten, many thought that Washington's efforts had

been decisive in prevailing over the opposition of Patrick Henry. "Be assured,"

James Monroe said, "General Washington's influence carried this government."<p>



<p>



<p>



<font size=4><b>5.</font></b><p>



<p>



Washington had not been subjected to personal abuse, though in several

instances relations had been strained. "With some," he said, "to have differed

in sentiment is to have passed the Rubicon of their friendship." He added:

"With others (for the honor of humanity) I hope there is more liberality; but

the consciousness of having discharged that duty, which we owe our country is

superior to all other considerations." Unruffled, he continued: "It is the lot

of humanity. But if the shafts of malice had been aimed at me in ever so

pointed a manner...shielded as I was by a consciousness of having acted in

conformity to what I believed my duty, they would have fallen blunted from

their mark....At my age, and in my circumstance, what sinister object or

personal emolument had I to seek after, in this life?"<p>



<p>



Now that the task was performed and the new government was assured of a chance

to prove itself, he hoped once again that he could return permanently to the

quiet occupation he most enjoyed. "The growing infirmities of age and the

increasing love of retirement daily confirm my predilection for domestic life:

and the great Searcher of human hearts is my witness that I have no wish which

aspires beyond the humble and happy lot of living and dying a private citizen

on my own farm."<p>



<p>



When this was written, August 16, 1788, Washington knew that jealous, hostile

men probably were saying already he "aspired"--and to the highest office. While

the Philadelphia convention still was in session, the assumption had been that

he would head the new government. The powers vested in the President of the

United States had been shaped, as Pierce Butler said afterwards, with one eye

on Washington; otherwise they would not have been so extensive. Lafayette,

reading the constitution "with an unspeakable eagerness and attention" in

Paris, was alarmed because a President who exercised those powers was eligible

for re-election. But he found comfort, he wrote, in the belief that Washington

could not decline the presidency and, once in the chair, would recommend that

the seat be narrowed if it proved too much like a permanent throne.<p>



<p>



In February, 1788, General John Armstrong, friend and comrade since the days of

the French and Indian War, had exhorted Washington solemnly: "Persuaded as I am

it will cost you much anxious thought, nevertheless, if the call of God is

manifested to you in a plenary or unanimous call of the people, I hope that

will obviate every objection; if not for the whole term of four years, at least

for half that time, if health admit; considering, as you will, that we were not

made for ourselves, therefore must not live to ourselves. My sole reason for

these early hints is, that by a divine blessing you may be made instrumental in

giving a wise and useful EXAMPLE TO SUCCESSORS, in more things than what may be

merely essential to the office."<p>



<p>



Washington scarcely could have read a more disturbing letter or one written in

wiser appeal to his love of country. In answer, he reminded Armstrong he had

accepted membership in the convention because, "at so critical a moment, an

absolute refusal to act might on my part be construed as a total disregard of

my country, if impelled to no worse motives"; but a call to another "tour of

duty" of this kind? He hoped from his heart he would not receive it. "I am so

wedded to a state of retirement," he said, "and find the occupations of a rural

life so congenial with my feelings, that to be drawn into public at my age

could be a sacrifice that would admit of no compensation."<p>



<p>



There he left it; there he prayed it would remain. Even to Lafayette, he

elaborated only in this: "it might not be decent for me to say I would refuse

to accept or even to speak much about an appointment which may never take

place." He repeated over and over again that he did not entertain a wish

"beyond that of living and dying an honest man on my own farm," but these

answers neither silenced nor satisfied the Federalists, whose cause he had made

his own. They continued to urge him to accept an office they insisted the

electors unanimously would tender him.<p>



<p>



<p>



<font size=4><b>6.</font></b><p>



<p>



As long as he could, he persisted in saying, "The event...may never happen,"

but by October, 1788, he felt the "kind of gloom" coming over him that always

had shadowed him when he had to make a crucial decision. He comforted himself,

as best he could, with the assurance that if he had to accept, he would remain

in office no longer than was necessary to get the new bark over the shoals and

into the clear channel. Then he might be permitted "once more to retire," as he

wrote wistfully, "to pass an unclouded evening after the<p>



stormy day of life." Another hope of the autumn was that the "government would

be just as happily and effectually carried into execution without my aid as

with it." He did not find his friends willing to admit this, or even to look

for someone else. Before the month ended, he was forced to say, "At my time of

life, and under my circumstances, nothing in this world can ever draw me from

[retirement] unless it be a CONVICTION that the partiality of my countrymen had

made my services absolutely necessary, joined to a FEAR that my refusal might

induce a belief that I preferred the conservation of my own reputation and

private ease to the good of my country."<p>



<p>



On that he stood, but not confidently, because the two influences he had

underlined, the conviction of duty and the fear of just reproach, challenged

him hourly. In December he cried: "May Heaven assist me in forming a judgment,

for at present I see nothing but clouds and darkness before me....If ever I

should, from any apparent necessity, be induced to go from home in a public

character again, it will certainly be the greatest sacrifice of feeling and

happiness that ever was or ever can be made by [me]." He still clung to the

hope that he would not be called, and he told himself that if he were elected

he would decline if he could.<p>



<p>



One letter after another, written to those he knew would keep his statement

confidential, set forth his overwhelming perplexity. Against acceptance he

mustered all save one of the arguments that seemed most reasonable to him: he

was too old; his interest was in agriculture; he had a growing love of

retirement; the office would involve new fatigues and trouble; if he returned

to public life after all he had said about ending his service, might he not be

"chargeable with levity and inconsistency, if not with rashness and ambition"?

His last citadel of defense was the assertion that the duties of the office

most certainly could be discharged by someone else as successfully as by him.

What he naturally kept to himself was the unhappy state of his finances: he did

not have money with which to pay for even current household purchases and he

would have to go deeper in debt to make the journey to the temporary capital.<p>



<p>



In the "contra" column of this balance sheet of duty and inclination, the

heaviest entry had the simplicity of this eight-word question: Was the good of

the country at stake? If danger or collapse did not threaten the new structure,

he would remain in his own house, where by silence and kindly action he could

preserve the good opinion of his fellow citizens; but if the welfare of the

United States required his service, he would leave Mount Vernon again, risk his

reputation and endure the clamor, the censure, the unjust abuse even, he was

apt to receive. "If I know myself," he said, "I would not seek or retain

popularity at the expense of one social duty or moral virtue."<p>



<p>



The new year, 1789, brought hope for the future of America along with added

unhappiness for Washington. Elections to the First Congress, he wrote

Lafayette. "have been hitherto vastly more favorable than we could have

expected." There were evidences of an "increasing unanimity" that was "not less

indicative of the good disposition than the good sense of the Americans."

Through the "clouds and darkness" of his own perplexity, Washington thought he

saw "a path as clear and direct as a ray of light, which led to the attainment"

of national happiness. "Nothing," he continued, "but harmony, honesty, industry

and frugality are necessary to make us a great and happy people." In that was

promise and perhaps reward, but with it--of all things!--an embarrassing

multitude of insistent applications for office as if he already were President.

To the burden of answering these letters was added the task of getting affairs

in order at Mount Vernon. Five or six hundred pounds had to be borrowed, also,

if Alexandria merchants were to be paid before...<p>



<p>



Yes, it now was "before" and not "if" he had to quit that beloved refuge of his

on the Potomac, and face again the contest and confusion. He did not say in

plain words "I will accept," because formal notice of election had not been

received. The electors in the various States were assumed to have met on

February 4 and were believed to have cast their votes unanimously for

Washington; but their certificates had to be delivered to the new Congress,

which was not due to meet until a month later. In March, Washington's

correspondents wrote discouragingly of the slow arrival of Senators and

Representatives. It was impossible to say when a quorum would be mustered and

the vote be counted, but the result was certain. Washington knew it, and knew

that his sense of duty demanded he accept. There was no escape. Delay in the

organization of Congress, he told himself, was no more than a reprieve.<p>



<p>



Painfully, sadly, on the 1st of April he opened his heart to Henry Knox, his

still-young former Chief of Artillery, the man who had never failed him: "My

movements to the chair of government will be accompanied by feelings not unlike

those of a culprit who is going to the place of his execution: so unwilling am

I in the evening of a life nearly consumed in public cares, to quit a peaceful

abode for an ocean of difficulties, without that competency of political skill,

abilities and inclination which is necessary to manage the helm. I am sensible

that I am embarking the voice of my countrymen and a good name of my own, but

what returns will be made for them, Heaven alone can foretell. Integrity and

firmness is all I can promise; these, be the voyage long or short, never shall

forsake me, though I may be deserted by all men."<p>



<p>



That was the decision; the rest was formality. When Charles Thomson arrived at

Mount Vernon on the 14th of April and delivered the official announcement of

unanimous election, Washington wasted no time in answer: "Having been impressed

with an idea of my being with Congress at as early a period as possible, I

propose to commence my journey...the day after tomorrow"; a long, hard journey

for him--and for any like-minded man who comes after him.

<font size=5>"W</font>hat if the shantytowns and bidonvilles sprouting up 
around the globe that do not appear on any maps are far more important to 
the future of civilization than many of the downtowns and prosperous 
suburbs that do appear on maps?"  "Will this new order be characterized by 
moving 'centers' of power, as in the Middle Ages?"  And what if, as a result, 
borders and nation-states as we now know them cease to exist?<p>

So muses <A HREF="../../../atlweb/kaplan/KapBio.htm">Robert D. Kaplan</A> 
-- one of <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>'s most provocative 
writers -- in his latest work, <I>The Ends of the Earth</I> 
(Random House, 1995).  The book is an outgrowth of Kaplan's phenomenally 
popular (and in some quarters  <I>un</I>popular) <I>Atlantic</I> cover 
story 
titled <A HREF="../../../election/connection/foreign/anarchy.htm">"The 
Coming Anarchy"</a> (February, 1994).  The article focused on blighted regions 
of 
Europe, West Africa, and the Middle East and ended by predicting that the 
first half of the twenty-first century will be characterized by 
"environmental scarcity, cultural and racial clash, geographic destiny, 
and the transformation of war."  The writing is bleak -- even apocalyptic 
-- but it is deliberately so: Kaplan felt at the time that nobody was 
paying 
attention to what was <I>really</I> news.  
U.S. President Bill Clinton was drawn in; he referred 
to "The Coming Anarchy" as "stunning" and passed it around as recommended 
reading in the 
White House.  Others were not so impressed: one writer in <I>The New York 
Times</I> accused Kaplan of making an "alarmist jumble of Africa that 
betrays 
American prejudices," and an editorialist in the magazine <I>West 
Africa</I>  suggested that points made in "The Coming Anarchy" were not 
"the 
first time that different parts of [West Africa] have been used as passive 
foils for the psychoses of others."<p>

"The Coming Anarchy" became one of the best-selling issues in <I>The 
Atlantic 
Monthly</I>'s history -- proving, depending upon one's reaction to the 
article, either that many people share Kaplan's concerns or that 
apocalyptic reporting sells magazines.  In either case, the 
article was read and cited far and wide;  Kaplan succeeded in provoking 
the debate that he felt was necessary.<p>
  
In <I>The Ends of the Earth</I>, Kaplan travels throughout Africa, the 
Middle 
East, and Asia -- to places predominantly not on the political map -- and 
finds largely what he had hypothesized in "The Coming Anarchy": a world in 
which populations are booming, the environment is poisoned and withering, 
borders of all sorts are crumbling, cultures are rotting, and cities are 
being transformed into huge and sprawling villages.  Do we realize, he 
asks at the book's conclusion, that "We are not in control"?  Are we 
aware that he's not just talking about the future of the Third World, but 
of the rest of the world, too? <p>
 
In the August, 1996 issue of <I>The Atlantic</I>, Kaplan is back with 
<A HREF="Proport.htm">"Proportionalism,"</a> a proposal for dealing 
with the problems described in "The Coming Anarchy" and <I>The Ends of the 
Earth</I>.  "We are all wringing our hands over the plight of failing, 
unstable regions of the Third World," he says, "especially those in 
sub-Saharan Africa.  But there is little consensus on what the American 
response should be."  Kaplan here proposes a foreign policy that "might do 
gradual but unmistakable good where good can in fact be done."  The ideas 
he lays out are controversial, but Kaplan's aim, as always, is to raise 
important 
questions and make them available for intelligent debate.<p>

After reading "Proportionalism," and perhaps 
reviewing "The 
Coming 
Anarchy," join in the debate by posting 
your reactions in the "Global Views" conference area of Post 
& Riposte. (First-time users enter <A HREF="/atlantic/p&r/p&rhelp.htm">here</a>; registered

centuries.  <A 
HREF="http://www.self-gov.org/freeman/8707maje.htm">Some conservatives think that the free market

even a display of interest in a place like <A 
HREF="http://www.vtourist.com/vt/africa.htm">Africa</A> indicates naive 
do-goodism.  At one extreme is Pat Buchanan, at the Mexican border with a 
gun and a black cowboy hat, holding off the tide of darker peoples.  At the 
other extreme is Mrs.  Jellyby, in Dickens's <i>Bleak House</i>, whose eyes 
"could see nothing nearer than Africa!" Mrs.  Jellyby let her London 
household go to ruin while she wrote letters all day in support of a tribe 
on the Niger River.  Caught among the various mindsets are well-meaning 
Washington bureaucrats who are trying to craft workable policies on global 
humanitarian issues.  <p> A durable foreign-aid consensus--one that might 
do gradual but unmistakable good where good can in fact be done--must be 
built on two seemingly contrary realizations: <p>

* Although some human societies have made end runs around their own histories
and environments, exceptionalism is, well, the exception. The fact that Africa
continues to fall economically behind the Indian subcontinent (the second
poorest region on the planet), despite billions spent on development assistance
over the decades, amounts to an inescapable negative judgment. Not even Russia,
with its 150 million people, 99 percent of whom are literate, can be pivotally
affected by aid. To think that aid can fundamentally change sub-Saharan Africa,
whose population is 3.75 times that of Russia and whose literacy rate is much,
much lower, is to take a position that few people outside a narrow intellectual
elite will accept. As our own historically high economic-growth rates fall, it
is not even clear that American exceptionalism can be counted on: we will have
less money in the future for foreign aid, not more.<p>

* Although development assistance rarely changes history dramatically, it can
do significant good in a significant number of places. And it can do good in
ways that help us to reinvent ourselves as a nation in the context of a more
interconnected world, while also promoting vital security interests. A growing
African middle class, for instance, would constitute an enormous market for
American products. An Africa in which viruses could be monitored and controlled
would preserve AIDS as a singularity rather than a harbinger of more pandemics.
Given that disease is affected by poverty, migration, and environmental trends,
helping Africa is strategically important if only in terms of cold
self-interest. <p>


<CENTER>
* * *
</CENTER>

<p>

A development policy toward the underdeveloped world must have the ability to
win political support in Washington and the nation at large. This is a simple
fact that no amount of idealism or wishful thinking can get around. A
development policy must engage us without overstraining us. Its criteria must
be clear. And it must not set us up for failure. Expensive stunts like the
invasions of Somalia and Haiti are risky in the context of an
isolationist-tending climate of political discourse. If such endeavors fail,
they threaten funding for useful programs in politically and economically
fragile places where hope survives.<p>

</table>

Herein is a rough sketch for a Third World aid policy. It is inspired in some
measure by the principle known as proportionalism, adopted by some Catholic
theologians on certain vexing moral issues. Proportionalism provides a useful
moral approach to the Third World. 


In theological terms proportionalism is
about doing or accepting a certain amount of "evil" to make possible a
proportionately greater amount of good; it underlies theories of a just war and
also, for some Catholics, the argument in favor of promoting the use of
contraceptives as a means of reducing abortion. In everyday, non-theological
terms it is about beating a retreat in order to preserve what is most
important. Proportionalism is anathema to moral and ideological purists. It
tempers implacable principle with common sense.<p>

Foreign-aid proportionalism would have three aspects: the aid itself, early
warning, and extremely rare interventions. What follows is a framework for
disparate ideas and policies that have been bruited about and in some cases
partly implemented.<p>

First, the foreign aid itself would not be increased overall, because 
forging a political consensus for maintaining levels as they are is hard 
enough.  But it would be targeted at bread-and-butter regionwide programs 
that seek to slow societal deterioration gradually, in order to create an 
environment for the emergence of healthier politics.  It would <i>not</i> 
be targeted at making a particular country democratic in the face of a low 
literacy rate, the absence of a middle class, and a history of ethnic or 
regional strife.  The Washington establishment chants that democracies 
don't go to war, but what are emerging in many places are 
pseudo-democracies, societies teetering on ungovernability which hold 
elections out of desperation rather than as the final step in a process of 
economic and political development.  Reduced emphasis on "democratic 
elections" would mean a new emphasis instead on <A 
HREF="http://www.msh.org/fpmd/fpmdhome.html"> population control</A>, women's 
literacy, and resource-renewal projects.  If more conservatives knew, for 
example, that an 85 percent cut in <A 
HREF="http://www.info.usaid.gov/">U.S. Agency for International 
Development</A> family-planning programs would lead to 1.6 million more 
abortions a year by desperate women in developing countries, enough of them 
might support renewing these programs to form a majority with liberals.  
Moreover, it has been shown that increased literacy among women reduces the 
birth rate: literate women exert more power in their relationships with 
men, control their own lives and those of their children better, and use 
financial and natural resources more intelligently.  Nothing promotes 
positive social evolution in the Third World more speedily than women's 
education.<p>

Second, early warning. Some equate pessimism about the Third World with
cynicism. In truth, pessimism is often both a realistic and a moral response:
we <i>should</i> be scouting for trouble, not indulging fond hope. Probing for
trouble in advance--as the United States is doing now in <A 
HREF="http://198.76.84.1/HORN/burundi/usstate/testimny.txt">Burundi</A>--will not
always pay dividends. But there will be times when conflict management sooner
will forestall more agonizing choices later. <p>

The third aspect is intervention--the rarer the better.  The so-called 
Powell Doctrine--which calls for intervention only when it can be quickly 
and easily accomplished--has been criticized for moral obtuseness.  But the 
Powell Doctrine is in fact a good start.  The degree of difficulty of a 
humanitarian relief operation <i>must </i>be a criterion in making a 
decision, for if it is not, our misadventures will preclude intervention 
even when intervention would otherwise have been worthwhile.  The other 
criteria should be the strategic value of the place where we are 
considering intervening and the psychological weight that such an 
intervention might exert on other parts of the world.  Interventions in 
places and situations in which morality coincides with ease, strategic 
value, and leverage would meet what the military calls the parents' test: 
when a Pentagon official can stare a soldier's parents in the eye and tell 
them that their son or daughter died in the service of something worth 
dying for.  (There are situations in which the strategic value is 
significant but so is the difficulty--such as in the Balkans and on the 
Korean peninsula.  These places are historical legacies of sacrifices in 
three wars that saw great losses of American lives, and compared with which 
our historical involvement in a place like Liberia pales in significance.)  
In any case, here is <A 
HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/alumni/almag/kennan.html">George F. Kennan</A>, cautioning 
against intervention in Somalia--a warning that applies to other Third 
World states that have gone into the abyss.<p>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
The fact is that this dreadful situation cannot possibly be put to rights other
than by the establishment of a governing power for the entire territory, and a
very ruthless, determined one at that. It would not be a democratic one,
because the very pre-requisites for a democratic political system do not exist
among the people in question.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>

The framework outlined above accepts a certain amount of evil (diminished
concern for elections; a willingness in many cases to stand by and watch
atrocious situations without intervening) in order to pursue an attainable good
(low-risk, high-yield interventions only, and only on rare occasions; modest
but clear involvement in literacy and other bread-and-butter programs in places
where improvement is possible). We must stay engaged, but within strict limits.<p>

	YLE and Deborah haven't been to New York before. The convention of the
East Coast Assassination Investigation Workshops has finally brought them to
the city, at Lyle's insistence. Deborah has found, even coming in from the
airport, that New York is as she has heard--the rudeness and all. She looks out
of the hotel van and sees a grungy man in another car staring at her,
unabashed. She looks away.</font><p>

"How safe do you think we'll be?" Deborah says.<p>

"Like I said before, we'll be fine," Lyle says. "As long as we stay in the
hotel or close by, we'll be fine. We'll be among friends."<p>

Lyle and Deborah are both forty-eight. They live in Denver now, where Lyle
services photocopiers and Deborah is in insurance. They have no children, and
for this reason they have the luxury of spending a week here. Lyle wanted to go
"all out" for this, and Deborah doesn't mind. At the regional conventions
they've been to, in Dallas three times, and also in Portland and Kansas City,
she has always found plenty to do while Lyle attends his seminars. Last year,
in Kansas City, while he sat through "The Warren Commission: Footnotes and
Falsehoods," she shopped and went sightseeing and had long, contemplative
lunches by herself. When they returned home, Lyle holed up in his basement file
room every night after dinner, sure he was on to something. Lyle feels he has
made a breakthrough, and this is why they have come to the Big One, in New
York. Their dogs, matching lhasa apsos named Zapruder and Mannlicher, are being
boarded at the veterinarian's.<p>

Checking in at the hotel, Lyle is recognized. When he says, "Reservation for
Lyle Asay," a man off to the rear of them says, "Umbrella Man." In this age of
specialization the Umbrella Man happens to be Lyle's specialty.<p>

"That man's talking to you, honey," Deborah says.<p>

"What?"<p>

"Him. He said, 'Umbrella Man.'"<p>

Lyle turns, and with a grin introduces himself. The man's name is Otto Litwak.
He is an eightyish man with the bearing of a professor. He, too, will be
attending tomorrow's 10:30 A.M. conference, "The Umbrella Man: Grassy Knoll,
Sunny Day--Signals and Codes?"<p>

"I am something of an expert myself," Litwak says, "although not of your
caliber. Word has come from the American interior about your work."<p>

"I don't recall hearing your name," Lyle says.<p>


"I stay in Trenton," Litwak says. "I don't travel much."<p>

All the way up in the elevator Lyle is ecstatic. Deborah asks him if it wasn't
rude to have said he'd never heard of the man. Lyle says, "But I never have."
<p>

Although he is not a panel member at the conference, Lyle has planned to seize
the floor and present his findings, which he believes will prove that the
Umbrella Man was the linchpin of the conspirators' plan. Seizing the floor is a
part of the culture, and he has already circulated word that he'll be doing it.
He was worried that he might not be known in New York as he is in Kansas City
and Portland, but now that fear is laid aside.<p>

"People are expecting me!" Lyle says. He's got his tan suit on, with the big
cowboy hat, as if he were a Texas Ranger, or maybe a cattleman.<p>

"This is the big moment!" he says. "This is where they bite the bullet!" Then
he says what he always says when he's excited: "Jack, you son of a bitch!"<p>

<img src="Fictiona.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

Lyle has been saving up and doing his research for two years, waiting to be
here, and his excitement has been further churned by rumors that Oliver Stone
will show up to speak. Lyle and his friends believe that Stone will be making a
sequel to <i>JFK</i>, and word is that he will hire three technical advisers
for hundreds of thousands of dollars each.<p>

Deborah knows very little about Lyle's theories. She prefers to ignore them.
She believes in a single shooter. Had he known this before they married, she
knows, it would have been a sign of incompatibility he couldn't stomach. So she
has distanced herself. "Kennedy's dead and we can't change that," she says to
Lyle when he asks her opinion on things. There is an unreflective doggedness in
these words that Lyle clearly finds disturbing, and therefore avoids. He hasn't
asked for years. For the most part their marriage is good.<p>

All the way from the house in Denver, Lyle has carried his heavy briefcase with
him, and now he is unwilling to trust it to the bellhop. Deborah has decided
that his next Christmas gift should be a new briefcase, and that she will find
a way to have a handcuff attached. She knows Lyle well enough to know that
he'll love it: it will be a semi-serious gift, like the pink pillbox hat he got
her a few years ago. He has a flair for showmanship, and for paranoia. In the
airport coffee shop in Chicago, waiting to switch planes, he held the briefcase
between his ankles while they ate. <p>

In their room, when the rest of the luggage has arrived, he snaps open the
briefcase and stacks his piles of manila folders on the table. Deborah hangs up
their clothes, takes a shower, and gets dressed. At six o'clock she says,
"Lyle? Dinner?"<p>

He looks up from his papers as if she has just burst in unexpectedly. "Gee,
Deb," he says, "I don't know if I can, with my conference first thing in the
morning." He is nervous, she can tell. She shrugs. "I'll go down alone," she
says. "I need to get out of this room for a while."<p>

On the elevator down to the lobby she doesn't feel upset. This is typical.
After the Umbrella Man conference Lyle will attend another four and a half days
of meetings, but he will be more relaxed, having gotten past his own moment of
special attention.<p>

At the third floor a man steps into the elevator, and she sees that it is
Litwak.<p>

"Ah, Mrs. Asay!" he says. "Off to dine, are we?"<p>

"Lyle's reviewing his papers," she says. "He wants to be ready."<p>

"I should think you know a great deal about the Umbrella Man yourself," Litwak
says. "What is your favorite aspect of the case?"<p>

"Nothing, really," Deborah says. "I really don't pay much attention."<p>

Litwak laughs. "I'm sure you're being modest. I know that my own
accomplishments could not have amounted to anything without the support of the
late Mrs. Litwak. I remember how she'd listen to each of my new hypotheses, and
then rip it to shreds. Back to the drawing board! You must know the main points
of his argument."<p>

"I don't think so," she says. "Did your wife really do that?" She thinks she
has seen only men at these conventions.<p>

When they get off the elevator, Litwak nods good-bye and shuffles off toward
the street. In the hotel dining room Deborah has a club sandwich and orders a
glass of wine, and then she looks in the gift shop before returning to the
room. Lyle is in the same bent position as when she left.<p>

"I saw your friend Litwak on the elevator down," she says.<p>

This gets Lyle's attention. "What did he say?"<p>

"Nothing much. Just hello. He was asking for you."<p>

"Yeah? What was he asking?"<p>

"He was asking about your work."<p>


Lyle stands now, his hand still on a stack of papers. He has the umbrella out,
the one he brings to conferences, to demonstrate various postulates. He also
has a toy gun, a plastic Luger, to demonstrate the way it could be slipped
beneath the furled fabric. Lyle has told Deborah that he has learned the
theatrics necessary to his endeavors.<p>

"I've never heard of this guy," Lyle says. He picks up the telephone, retrieves
a slip of paper from his pocket, and dials. "Fritz Reis," he says. Fritz is
another buff from Denver, a close ally. He's staying at a less-expensive hotel
uptown.<p>

"Fritz? Lyle. Tell me if you've ever heard the name Otto Litwak." He listens.
"No, no. I mean now. He's here. I never have either. But he knows my work."<p>

When he hangs up, Lyle drums the desk with his fingers. "Fritz says he's never
heard of him. Greg is there, and he doesn't know him either. No one has ever
heard of him."<p>

Lyle picks up the house phone. "Do you have a guest by the name of Litwak
here?" he says. After a moment he says, "You don't? I see. Thank you." He looks
at Deborah. "Jack, you son of a bitch," he says.<p>

<p>
<br>
	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/L-small.gif" align=left 
	height=44 alt="L"></font>YLE and Deborah have been married twenty-two years. At first Deborah
didn't notice the obsession in Lyle. He was someone who seemed to take a
general interest in politics. He bought a few books. He was in his mid-twenties
and seemed to have better things to do. The reading he did, of the Warren
Commission report and <i>Death of a President</i> and all the newspaper
stories, indicated to her something vaguely cerebral. He was working as a
fabrication engineer then, and the after-work investigations gave him a break
from the pressure.<p>

The twentieth anniversary of the assassination, however, seemed to set him off.
His company had been downsizing, and Lyle had taken a buyout and tried to start
his own company, selling public-domain software. He had a little office in
their basement, and a lot of free time as he sat there waiting for people to
phone in orders. That was when he began to see the whole grand scheme.<p>

It didn't start with the Umbrella Man. It started with the puffs of smoke from
behind the wall. He began researching weapons and ammunition, trying to
determine what might have caused the puffs of white. He tried to be a
generalist. He tried to delve into Ferrie and Shaw. But as he studied photos
taken across the Grassy Knoll, he couldn't get his mind off the Umbrella Man.<p>

The first order of tomorrow's meeting will no doubt be the discrediting of one
Louis Witt, who came forward in the seventies to claim that he was the Umbrella
Man. He has explained himself by saying that the umbrella he opened on that
sunny day was symbolic of appeasement, a reference to Chamberlain's rolling
over for Hitler on that fateful day in Munich. But trashing Witt is always a
prelude to the real talks, like an invocation. Lyle once got Witt on the phone,
years ago, with a tape recorder running and a suction-cup microphone on the
receiver. He shouted at Witt until the man, after demanding to know how Lyle
got his phone number, hung up. Deborah remembers the redness of Lyle's face
after that call, his wild-eyed look; she remembers it because he has it now,
thinking of Litwak. Deborah has put on her nightgown and gotten into bed. In
the corner Lyle is still going over his documents.<p>

"Honey," she says, "come to bed. You need to rest."<p>

<p>
<br>
	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/W-small.gif" align=left 
	height=44 alt="W"></font>HEN she awakens, a little before six, Lyle is still
at 	the table, in his
clothes. Has he slept and then gotten up again? "Lyle, are you all right?"<p>

"I'm fine," he says. "I'm ready." He stands up and his hands move toward his
back, which stiffens when he does these all-night sessions. "I just need a
shower," he says.<p>

She knows he won't go down for breakfast, so while he's in the shower, she
orders room service. He's still in the bathroom, shaving, when the food comes,
scrambled eggs and toast and orange juice and coffee. In a hotel bathrobe, he
eats quickly, without talking, and then he gets dressed, knotting a
geometrically patterned tie that exactly matches Kennedy's on that day: the
Kansas City convention had a guy in a booth selling these ties and PT-109 tie
clips, both of which sold out almost immediately.<p>

"In case you need to know, I'm going to go to Macy's today," Deborah says.
"Then Bergdorf Goodman. I don't want you to worry."<p>

Distracted, Lyle says, "Where's my umbrella?"<p>

"I don't know," Deborah says.<p>

"It was right here on the table. When I went in the shower."<p>

"I never touched it, honey."<p>

"I don't believe this," Lyle says.<p>

He looks all around the room, in the closet, under the bed, and in the
bathroom. "It's gone," he says.<p>

"It's got to be here somewhere," Deborah says.<p>

"It's not, can't you see that?" he says. He stands, rubbing his bottom lip with
his fingertips, and then he says, "Who brought the food?"<p>

"Oh, Lyle, come on."<p>

"Is there any other explanation?" he says. <i>"Is there any other
explanation?"</i><p>

"I don't know," she says.<p>

"Now I have to find a new umbrella!" he says. He goes to the table, takes his
plastic Luger, and puts it in his waistband at the small of his back. He puts
on his suit coat and hefts his briefcase to his side, and then he's gone.<p>


Within ten minutes Deborah finds the umbrella, underneath the folded-back
bedcovers. She realizes that the boy from room service had to move the umbrella
from the table, so that he could put the tray of food there. She finishes
dressing, and on the way out she takes the umbrella with her.<p>

In the lobby of the hall where the convention is taking place, she finds the
registration-and-information table. "I'm trying to give this to someone," she
says, holding out the umbrella.<p>

"We don't go for pranks," the man at the table says. He is wearing sunglasses
and has a beige wire snaking from his collar up into his ear.<p>

"No, honestly," she says. "My husband thought he had lost it, but it's found.
He really may need it."<p>

"Listen," the man says, "there are a hundred and ten people in that room, and I
can count on one hand the number of people who walked in <i>without</i> an
umbrella. If he needs to use one, he has plenty to choose from."<p>

"No," she says. "He needs this one."<p>

The man jumps to his feet. "Hey," he says, "we don't want any funny business
here."<p>

<p>
<br>
	<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/I-small.gif" align=left 
	height=44 alt=I></font>N Bergdorf Goodman she decides that she shouldn't 	have thrown Lyle's umbrella
in a trash can, but she knows she'll never get it back. She walked from the
information table out through the lobby; on the street she saw that the day was
cool and brilliant, and, disgusted, she relieved herself of the umbrella. She
knows she'll never hear the end of it if she doesn't admit it wasn't stolen.<p>

She likes crowded places, and moves through the store slowly, rustling against
passing shoppers as they squeeze by islands of merchandise. She can't help
thinking what Lyle often asks when they are in a well-known place: "Can you
imagine what it was like here on that day?" Lyle's memory of all that is
sharply defined. He grew up in Delaware, and he recalls being on the broad lawn
outside his high school gym, playing touch football, when he heard. <p>

Deborah told Lyle that she doesn't remember what she was doing when she heard,
and that threw him into a rage. Then he came up with a restyled theory: she was
in shock. Actually she remembers precisely what she was doing. She was on a
first date with her hottest flame ever, Westy Dodd. They were sitting in a soda
shop in her home town of Bradford, Pennsylvania. Someone, some face from her
high school homeroom, ran into the place and said, "Somebody shot the
President!" If she had a reaction, its intensity has faded in memory, and what
she remembers is the brief thought that this date would be ruined. Then
Westy--his slicked-down blond hair gleaming in the fall light--reached across
and took her hands in his, and said, "Let's choose not to be unhappy." She
remembers thinking, <i>That's all right with me</i>. By nightfall, as the
nation mourned, she was making out with Westy in his father's Rambler. Their
romance lasted only a month, but by then everyone had adjusted, and she had
seemed to just float above the sadness.<p>

Of course, everyone has memories, and hers, she knows, matter only in light of
Lyle's passions. The memory is one that would otherwise have been lost, or
filed away, or blunted.<p>
<p>
<br>
<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/A-small.gif" align=left 
	height=44 alt=A></font>FTER her shopping is completed, she takes a cab	back to the
hotel. When she comes into their room, the person she sees is Fritz. He's a
thin and graying man, probably about her age. He's sitting on the edge of the
bed, holding a plastic cup filled with ice and his usual Dewar's.<p>

Greg is at the table, staring at the television. He is a fat kid of twenty-one
or twenty-two whom Deborah and Lyle met in Kansas City. He has come over to the
assassination theorists from the <i>Star Trek</i> crowd, he says, because he
has come to understand how the assassination is the root of almost everything
important, including <i>Star Trek</i>, which he now understands was an enormous
homage to Kennedy and his vision.<p>

"Hail to the Queen!" Fritz says, raising his cup. Greg, in a T-shirt that rides
above his beltline, revealing pale and copious flesh, simply says, "Deborah."<p>

"Your husband struck fear in the hearts of the Darts," Fritz says. The Darts
are an Umbrella faction that contends that the umbrella on the Grassy Knoll was
actually a clever weapon that shot tiny poisonous darts. Lyle's theory is that
the umbrella, which is seen open and sideways in most photographs, was held
high on the shaft as the Umbrella Man brought a pistol to eye level, to achieve
accuracy in the shot that hit Kennedy's neck--the wound that was passed off by
conspiracy-connected doctors as an exit wound. Lyle believes that should the
real umbrella ever be found, it would have a small hole in its fabric, precut
to accommodate the gun's muzzle. The lack of that hole in Louis Witt's umbrella
proves that Witt was not the Umbrella Man.<p>

"Where's Lyle?" Deborah says.<p>

"In the shower," Fritz says. "Then we're going to dinner."<p>

"Oh," Deborah says.<p>

Lyle is just coming out of the bathroom, wrapped in a towel, carrying his own
drink. "I didn't think you'd mind, Deb," he says. "We have so much to
review."<p>

"I made reservations for only two," she says.<p>

"Already changed them," Lyle says.<p>

But they don't get in at the restaurant they've chosen, because Greg refuses to
wear a tie, putatively on principle. They end up at a vaguely seedy diner a few
blocks away. The place serves beer, and the men resume their drinking. Lyle is
still glowing. He has not yet even mentioned the lost umbrella, to Deborah's
relief. The three men fall into a rehash of the day's events.<p>

"Can you believe them?" Lyle says of the Darts. "I mean, what's their
problem?"<p>

"They're crackpots," Fritz says.<p>

"I mean, why not just make a big joke out of the whole thing?" Lyle says. "Why
not just mock the man's legacy?"<p>

Fritz turns to Deborah. "You should have seen your old man in there. He took
the floor away from the panel. People were listening, and I could hear some of
them whispering, `Who <i>is</i> that?' Lyle just knocked them dead. His
reconstruction of events was so--logical! They just sat stunned when he was
finished."<p>

"The Darts were met, and found wanting," Greg says.<p>

But Lyle isn't talking much.<p>

"Honey?" Deborah says. "Are you all right?"<p>

Lyle allows himself a semi-grin. "I'm fine," he says.<p>

"It's that Litwak that's got him worked up," Fritz says.<p>

"That Litwak's an odd duck."<p>

"What did he do?" Deborah says.<p>

"He was just <i>there</i>, hanging at the edges," Fritz says. "Very suspicious,
you know? Very weird."<p>

"Is he a Dart?"<p>

<img src="Fictionb.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

"He's not anything," Greg says, in a nearly annoyed way. "Don't you see the
point? An unknown man appears, by coincidence, as Lyle Asay is checking in,
coincidentally bumps into Mrs. Asay on the elevator, proceeds to grill her
about what she knows, coincidentally appears at a convention as Mr. Asay
reveals what may be the key to the entire conspiracy."<p>

"He didn't grill me," Deborah says.<p>

"They know that approach doesn't work," Fritz says.<p>

"They're very sophisticated."<p>

"What are you trying to say?" Deborah says.<p>

"He could be very dangerous," Greg says. Lyle nods gravely.<p>

"Oh, come on," Deborah says.<p>

"I'd replace that plastic Luger with the real thing," Fritz says.<p>

"Most women just don't get these kinds of things," Greg says.<p>

Deborah says nothing more, and the others quiet down and slowly sip from their
beer glasses. They part cursorily on the street; walking back toward their
hotel, Deborah says, "I mean, Lyle, my God!"<p>

"They're my friends," he says. "They're looking out for me."<p>

"Do you really think you're in some kind of danger?"<p>

"Man checks in under an assumed name, comes literally out of nowhere," Lyle
says.<p>

"He came from somewhere," she says. "Everybody comes from somewhere. I think he
said Trenton."<p>

"Yes," Lyle says. "But there is one key fact, an indisputable thing: an
umbrella stolen from a hotel room on a cloudless day. Explain that one."<p>

<p>
<br>
<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/T-small.gif" align=left 
	height=44 alt="T"></font>HEY walk the rest of the way without speaking. In the hotel room Lyle
undresses and gets in bed. "I didn't sleep last night," he says, and then he is
asleep. It's not even nine o'clock. She wants to put on the television, but
she's afraid it will wake him. She takes the room key from his pants, rides the
elevator to the lobby, and sits on a couch facing the front entrance. She is in
New York and wants to watch the world go by.<p>

After an hour or more has passed, she sees Litwak coming in. He is small and
precise, dressed with fastidiousness. He sees her, smiles, and then
approaches.<p>

"Your husband was quite marvelous today," he says.<p>

"He'll be happy to hear that," Deborah says. "I told him we'd spoken, and he
wanted to invite you to join us for dinner. But you weren't registered here."<p>

"I am with my friend Stein," he says. "We split the costs, so that Mrs. Stein
won't think we're being frivolous." He turns and signals a man who is hovering
nearby. "Bill, come meet Mrs. Asay." Stein is also elderly. "We're both retired
from the transit authority, down in Philadelphia," Litwak says. "We share an
interest, and decided this convention would be quite a lot of fun."<p>

"And has it been?" she says.<p>

"Beyond our expectations," Stein says. "So many fascinating theories."<p>

"You know, they all spy on each other," Deborah says. The two old men look at
each other approvingly.<p>

"I was a numismatist," Stein says. "But that crowd has gotten unforgivably
dull. Besides, looking at coins strains my eyes now. Otto brought me in from
the cold."<p>

"We are discussing our own umbrella theory," Stein says. "But of course we
can't reveal it. Perhaps next year."<p>

"I'm eager to hear it," Deborah says.<p>

A while after the men have gotten on the elevator, Deborah rises and makes her
way up to the room. As she comes through the door, Lyle starts up, staring from
his side of the bed, but then his eyes roll back and he's asleep again. She
realizes in these moments that both of them have begun to age. Deborah knows
that the vacation will get better, as they always do. By tomorrow Lyle will be
more like himself.<p>

She thinks of Lyle as he was, as he must have been, a boy racing across a
field, waiting for a football to descend into his hands, a boy only moments
away from hearing the news. He will never shake the idea of a conspiracy; it
informs his days; but in that moment of youthful self-absorption the crime was
not against a man he never met but against the person Lyle was and could have
been. Lyle, the young man going old, now rolls over on his side, and she can
hear only his soft snore against the blankets. What pictures form in his head
she cannot say. <p>

<H2>BIRCHES</H2>





<font size=4>

When I see birches bend to left and right<BR>

Across the lines of straighter darker trees,<BR>

I like to think some boy's been swinging them.<BR>

But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.<BR>

<A HREF="#birchnotes">Ice-storms do that.</A> Often you must have seen them<BR>

Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<BR>

After a rain. They click upon themselves<BR>

As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored<BR>

As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<BR>

Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells<BR>

Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust ---<BR>

Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<BR>

You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.<BR>

They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load<BR>

And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed<BR>

So low for long they never right themselves:<BR>

You may see their trunks arching in the woods<BR>

Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground<BR>

Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair<BR>

Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.<BR>

But I was going to say when truth broke in<BR>

With all her matter-of-fact about the ice storm,<BR>

<A HREF="#birchnotes">(Now am I free to be poetical?)</A> <br>

I should prefer to have some boy bend them<BR>

As he went out and in to fetch the cows ---<BR>

Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,<BR>

Whose only play was what he found himself,<BR>

Summer or winter, and could play alone.<BR>

One by one he subdued his father's trees<BR>

By riding them down over and over again<BR>

Until he took the stiffness out of them<BR>

And not one but hung limp, not one was left<BR>

For him to conquer. He learned all there was<BR>

To learn about not launching out too soon<BR>

And so not carrying the tree away<BR>

Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise<BR>

To the top branches, climbing carefully<BR>

With the same pains you use to fill a cup<BR>

Up to the brim, and even above the brim.<BR>

Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,<BR>

Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.<BR>

So was I once myself a swinger of birches.<BR>

And so I dream of going back to be.<BR>

It's when I'm weary of considerations,<BR>

And life is too much like a pathless wood<BR>

Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs<BR>

Broken across it, and one eye is weeping<BR>

From a twig's having lashed across it open.<BR>

I'd like to get away from earth awhile<BR>

And then come back to it and begin over.<BR>

May no fate willfully misunderstand me<BR>

And half grant what I wish and snatch me away<BR>

Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:<BR>

I don't know where it's likely to go better.<BR>

I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,<BR>

And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk<BR>

<I>Toward</I> heaven, till the tree could bear no more,<BR>

But dipped its top and set me down again.<BR>

That would be good both going and coming back.<BR>

One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.<P>

<H2>THE ROAD NOT TAKEN</H2>

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<BR>

And sorry I could not travel both<BR>

And be one traveler, long I stood<BR>

And looked down one as far as I could<BR>

To where it bent in the undergrowth;<P>

And having perhaps the better claim<BR>

Because it was grassy and wanted wear,<BR>

Though as for that the passing there<BR>

Had worn them really about the same,<P>



And both that morning equally lay<BR>

In leaves no step had trodden black.<BR>

Oh, I <A HREF="#roadnotes">marked</A> the first for another day! <BR>

Yet knowing how way leads on to way<BR>

I doubted if I should ever come back.<P>



I shall be telling this with a sigh<BR>

Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,<BR>

I took the one less traveled by,<BR>

And that has made all the difference.<P>

More than another noise<BR>

So close to our dwelling place?<BR>

Till we lose all measure of pace<BR>

They are that that talks of going<BR>

<B>A Note on the Recordings and the Text:</B><br> 



Peter Davison made these recordings at <I>The Atlantic 

Monthly</I>'s offices in Boston on February 29, 1996.  The text we are 

using here is that of the original versions of the poems as they appeared 

in the August, 1915, issue of <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>.  There are some 

differences between this text and the text of the poems as they appeared in 

later editions of Frost's poetry.  We have indicated significant differences in 

footnotes.  For the authoritative version of the text we are using <I>Robert 

Frost: Collected Poems, Prose, & Plays</I> (Library of America, 1995).  <p>







<B>A Note About the Audio:</B><br> 

The audio is provided here in two formats: <A 

HREF="http://www.realaudio.com">RealAudio</A> from Progressive Networks and 

<B>.au format</B>.  To listen to the recordings in either format, you must 

have a computer equipped with a sound card.  RealAudio 

allows you to hear the recordings as they stream onto your hard drive, 

without having to wait for the file to download.  To use RealAudio you must 

have at least a 14.4 kbps modem and you must have the <A 

HREF="http://www.realaudio.com/products/player.html">RealAudio Player</A> 

installed on your computer (it can be downloaded free of charge at the 

RealAudio site).  The .au format provides significantly higher sound 

quality, but in order to play the files you must first download them and have a 

compatible audio player installed on your computer.  If you are using 

Netscape on the Windows platform, it provides a player that will allow you 

to play .au files.  On the Macintosh platform you will need an audio player 

such as <A 

HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/MacMosaic/Supplementary/Helper.html">

SoundMachine</A>.<p>

	<font size=5>R</font>ose and I went by bus from Tours to Vernou, to take part in the Marquenets'
winemaking. We arrived on a starlit Sunday evening. Etienne, the young farm
hand who lived with the Marquenets, met us at the bus stop with wheelbarrow and
flashlight. Hefting our suitcases into the barrow, he told us supper was
waiting for us.<p>

<p>

We had tried to get some idea from the Marquenets of what it would cost us to
come as paying guests. But that question had been left hanging. "It all
depends," Monsieur Marquenet had said, smiling quizzically.<p>

<p>

"On what?" we asked.<p>

<p>

"On whether you will be workers or observers. Let us wait and see."<p>

<p>

"I think they will be observers," our friend Colette, who had introduced us to
the Marquenets, had declared. "Picking grapes is not child's play after the
first half hour. It gets you in the back."<p>

<p>

Patou, a large, shaggy dog of dubious ancestry, barked loudly as we entered the
gate, announcing our arrival. We crossed the dark courtyard and went into the
kitchen, one of a series of four caves that lined one side of the courtyard.
The hanging, unshaded electric light and a radio were the only modern things in
the room. There was a fire of grape fagots burning in the fireplace. From the
crane hung a marmite, a three-legged, round-bellied iron pot from which the
savory odors of a soup were escaping. At one side of the fireplace was a
cookstove, fed with wood. A round oilcloth covered table, a few chairs, a bench
along one wall, a wall cupboard, completed the furnishings.<p>

<p>

Greetings over, we were invited to sit down at the table. We had an aperitif of
Vouvray to start with, and then Madame Marquenet rose to fetch the soup.
Watching her as she bent over the marmite, her face, wreathed in smiles, lit up
by the burning fagots, I was warmed by a feeling that not only had we stepped
into a different way of life but we had also traveled back a century or two in
time.<p>

<p>

Besides us, the Marquenets had another guest, Claude, a stocky, sturdy,
well-built boy of twelve who was to work in the vendange. He lived and went to
school at nearby Tours but, as was the custom of the country, he had been
excused from classes for the period of the grape harvest. The other
vendangeurs, friends and neighbors, would arrive in the morning for
breakfast.<p>

<p>

"During a vendange," Monsieur Marquenet explained, "the workers eat all their
meals at the home of the vintner. That constitutes food wages. The money wages,
standard throughout the country, are 195 francs a day this year. Every
vendangeur knows beforehand what they are to be, for they are announced over
the radio." In American money this amounted to about 65 cents.<p>

<p>

The soup, fortified by bits of bread broken into it, was followed by a meat
dish, a vegetable, a salad, and cheese. We were on the last when our hosts
began gently probing into our intentions for the next day.<p>

<p>

"Perhaps," said Madame Marquenet, "you would like to sleep late tomorrow
morning. You can go to the vineyards in the afternoon."<p>

<p>

"But, no," we declared, "We'll begin at the same time as the others do. What
time shall we be down?"<p>

<p>

"Breakfast is at seven."<p>

<p>

We climbed up the hill to the home of our friend Colette, where we had a room
for the period of the vendange. We had barely fallen asleep, or so it seemed,
when Etienne called us. My instinct was to turn over, but Rose, made of more
heroic fiber, called out cheerfully, "Merci, Etienne."<p>

<p>

"I am leaving the flashlight at the door," he answered.<p>

<p>

We dressed quickly in slacks, jackets, coats, and heavy shoes. The moon was
still in the sky and the stars were shimmering through the mists as we made our
way down the hill. The crowing of the rooster, the cackling of hens, the
amiable barking of Patou, greeted us as we entered the courtyard. Madame
Marquenet, wiping her hands on her apron, welcomed us at the kitchen door.<p>

<p>

A fragrant smell of coffee and burning grape fagots filled the room. Overnight,
the place had been transformed. The round table on which we had eaten the
evening before had been pushed into a recess, and in its place was a long,
planked, oilcloth-covered table ranged against the wall bench. It was set for
breakfast. In the middle were four large platters of food, an enormous loaf of
bread about a yard long and a foot wide, and several bottles of red wine. One
platter held herring garnished with chopped celery and onion; another, sausage;
a third, rillette--a paste made of pork for which Touraine is famous; a fourth,
goat cheese. At the far end of the table were two bowls, two coffee spoons, two
knives, two napkins, and two wineglasses. The eight other places held nothing
but wineglasses.<p>

<p>

Etienne and Claude were already seated on the bench, eager and alert. Within a
few minutes, we heard voices, and feet stamping in the courtyard; and the
others, with Monsieur Marquenet in their midst, came in. There were four of
them--two girls in their late teens and two young men, one in his early
twenties, the other several years younger. The girls slipped out of their
wooden sabots and put on espadrilles before they entered the room.<p>

<p>

Gravely, Monsieur Marquenet introduced them to us--Josette, Laure, Rene, and
Henri. We were Mademoiselle Rose and Mademoiselle Ann. The following day, he
told us, there would be two other vendangeurs, a man and his wife, coming from
Tours. The wife would help with the cooking, the man with the wine-making.
After shaking hands all around, we sat down to breakfast. The places with the
bowls were ours.<p>

<p>

Before taking her place at the table, Madame Marquenet filled our pint-size
bowls with steaming coffee and hot milk.. Nobody else got coffee. Then,
standing before her chair, she held the giant loaf against her bosom and began
cutting thick slices of bread. A slice cut, she jabbed it with the point of her
knife and held it out to each in turn. This, we discovered, was the plate on
which each one placed his food as the platters were passed.<p>

<p>

The technique was a simple one. You served yourself with the herring mixture or
sausage by putting it on a portion of the bread, making a sort of open
sandwich. Then you used your knife to cut off a mouthful. The men pulled
jackknives out of their pockets; the girls, apologizing for their
forgetfulness, went to the cupboard for table knives like ours. While Madame
Marquenet was cutting bread, the wine bottles were passed around and the
glasses filled, our own among them. It was a marvelous breakfast, the best we
had ever eaten in France. Talk during that first meal was somewhat constrained.
We were strangers, Americans, and they didn't quite know how to take us.<p>

<p>

When the food was consumed, Madame Marquenet went to the fireplace and came
back with the coffeepot. Each one drained his wine, and the strong, hot coffee
was poured into the emptied glasses. I had not quite finished my coffee when
Rose nudged me to call my attention to Monsieur Marquenet, next to whom I was
sitting. He was offering me a bottle of something.<p>

<p>

"What is it?" I asked, aware that all eyes were on me.<p>

<p>

"Cognac, Mademoiselle," he replied. "Will you help yourself?"<p>

<p>

"Cognac for breakfast!" I looked at him and then at the others, who were
watching me. I wasn't going to be caught out that way. "You're joking," I
said.<p>

<p>

"Not at all," he answered, and to prove it he placed a lump of sugar in the
small amount of coffee he had left in his glass, poured a little cognac over
it, and, as I still hesitated, passed the bottle to the others. I realized then
that he had offered the bottle to me first out of courtesy. Twelve-year-old
Claude nonchalantly served himself in turn, remarking with a look of precocious
wisdom, "It is cold in the vineyards in the morning." The others agreed and I
decided to protect myself against the elements. "We can't fall by the wayside,"
I said to Rose, serving both of us. " We will, after this," she answered, but
there was a look of pleasure on her face as she drained the glass.<p>

<p>

Breakfast was over. The eight-pound loaf of bread was practically finished.
What remained Madame Marquenet cut up in chunks and threw to the dog and the
two cats. Four bottles of wine had been emptied. Before rising from the table,
each one with a morsel of soft bread wiped his knife clean. Rene put his knife
into his pocket; Henri, Etienne, and Claude, with a dexterous turn of the hand,
stuck theirs into the underside of the table at their places.<p>

<p>

Madame Marquenet produced two enormous aprons for Rose and me and tied them
securely over our coats. "You'll need them," she declared. "The juice will run
down your clothes." As we walked out the door, Rose, with an admiring look
backwards, remarked, "Ten people for breakfast and nothing to wash but a few
platters and wineglasses!"<p>

<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>2.</b></font><p>

<p>

Our first stop was at the wine cave of Monsieur Marquenet. There Rene, who had
preceded us, was waiting with the charrette, a high, two-wheeled wagon hitched
to a horse. Loaded on the vehicle were three enormous casks, the insides of
which were stained a beautiful purple; a large, conical basket, equally lovely
in color; and a number of pails. The stain, Etienne explained, came from the
black grapes used in making red wine. The red wine vendange, always earlier,
had been finished about a month ago. Over one of the casks, a huge hopper that
looked like a giant coffee grinder was mounted.<p>

<p>

Shyly, Rene asked us if we wished to ride to the vineyards, about a kilometer
away. Looking at the laden cart, we said we'd walk. Josette and Laure decided
otherwise. Placing a saboted foot on the hub of the tall wheel, they clambered
into the cart and squeezed in between the barrels. With Monsieur Marquenet and
the others, we followed the slow moving wagon on foot. The morning air was
sharp and cold and we were grateful for the bracer we had taken.<p>

<p>

The vineyards stretched for acres and acres before us. At first we thought they
all belonged to Monsieur Marquenet, but he told us that he owned only a small
parcel of this land. Following a deeply rutted wagon road, Rene stopped at the
Marquenet property. He handed a pail and a secateur, the small, sharp
grape-cutting scissors, to each of us.<p>

<p>

Two workers were assigned to a row of vines, one to cut on each side. Rose and
I, watching the others, took our places at our row and began snipping the
clusters of grapes and dropping them into our pails. It looked like simple work
and it is, but it is backbreaking. The vines grow to a height of about thirty
inches, and some of the clusters on the lower branches hang down to the
earth.<p>

<p>

Rose, having a weak back, found bending over difficult and, to save herself,
developed a method of her own. Instead of stooping in orthodox fashion as the
rest of us did, she squatted on her haunches and moved sideways along the row
in crab fashion.<p>

<p>

With careful precision, we snipped the healthy, golden clusters, leaving the
dry, mildewed, or rotten grapes on the vine. It was Etienne who, watching us
protectively out of the corner of his eye, came to tell us of the error of our
ways. Quickly he snipped the grapes that we had left behind. Everything was
used, he explained, the dry, the rotten, the mildewed. They gave flavor to the
wine, he said.<p>

<p>

When the pails were full, Rene, with the widemouthed conical basket or hotte
slung over his shoulders and strapped to his back, walked between the long rows
and each vendangeur emptied his grapes into the hotte, crushing them down with
the bottom of his pail to tighten the load. The full hotte weighed about sixty
pounds. Rene returned it to the charrette, emptied the basket into the mounted
hopper, and, turning a hand crank, crushed the grapes into the cask beneath.<p>

<p>

There was a simple and efficient system to his movements. By the time he
returned to our post, after crushing his load of grapes, our pail had to be
full again. It was a sort of assembly-line timing, our speed guided and
controlled by the methodical rhythm of Rene's coming and going.<p>

<p>

At first we were slow and felt embarrassed when, our pails but partly full, we
saw Rene descending upon us. Again Etienne, with sensitive courtesy, helped us
out. His own pail full, he laughingly came over to us and, with several deft
movements, added to our store. After a time, our fingers became more nimble and
when Rene arrived we were ready for him.<p>

<p>

Occasionally we had a few moments, as the others did, to stop and eat a
particularly fine bunch of grapes. With hands and wrists dripping juice, we
held the golden clusters up to our lips and bit into them, not stopping to pick
off each individual grape. We were grateful for the protection offered our
clothes by the aprons.<p>

<p>

From the moment he had assigned us our first row, Monsieur Marquenet left us
severely alone. But we knew that, from where he was working, he was observing
us and making note of our progress. Hiss keen eyes, as he moved about, swept
our finished rows and heaping pailfuls, missing nothing. At midmorning he
casually strolled over to us. Our pails were magnificently full to
overflowing.<p>

<p>

"I am going back to the cave, Mesdemoiselles," he said. "Would you like to stop
now and come with me?"<p>

<p>

"But, no," we answered. "The work isn't finished."<p>

<p>

His face crinkled in a pleased smile. "workers, not observers," he said.
"Good." He grinned impishly at Rene, who had stopped to collect our hoard. "Not
bad," Rene commented as we hefted the pails into the basket with a now
practiced hand. His smile showed approval. We had a feeling that Rene had been
skeptical about our skill and endurance and that we had scored a victory for
Monsieur Marquenet. We had not felt consciously uncomfortable before, but
suddenly we sensed that the atmosphere was different. It was warm and intimate
and friendly; invisible barriers had dissolved.<p>

<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>3.</font></b><p>

<p>

At the end of three hours, the last cask was full. Wearily we stood up straight
and stretched our aching limbs. Our hands were gummy with juice and mildew and,
ineffectively, we tried to clean them with clumps of wayside grass. Henri,
holding a large cluster of grapes, showed us a more efficient way. Squeezing
the cluster between his palms, he washed his hands with the flowing juice.
Then, kneeling, he rubbed them dry over the grass. We followed his example and
walked behind the wagon with him on the road back to the cave.<p>

<p>

He and Rene, he told us, were brothers. Their father had died the year before
and Rene, who was twenty-four, was now the head of the family. Like others in
the community, they owned vineyards and a wine cave. With the help of Monsieur
Marquenet, who was neighbor, friend, and adviser, they had finished making
their own wine the week before. It had been a plentiful year, he said; the cave
was full of good new wine. "The horse and charrette," he added with a certain
possessive pride, "belong to us. We have a friendly arrangement with Monsieur
Marquenet, just as my father did. He helps us during our vendange and we help
him with his."<p>

<p>

He went forward to lend a hand as Rene, with gentle words of encouragement,
backed the reluctant horse into the dim recesses of the cave. The wagon was
stopped before the wine press, and the three casks of crushed grapes were
emptied into it. The press, mounted on a cement platform, consisted of an
enormous circular container made of slats of wood with interstices between and
belted with iron bands. Above it, suspended from the ceiling, was a huge wooden
contraption, a giant wheel with heavy spokes, which could be lowered and raised
by a hand crank. The pressing, we were told, would be done at the end of the
day, after the haul of the afternoon was added to the morning's.<p>

<p>

From the half-filled press came a gentle burbling as the juice from the crushed
grapes began running down a trough into a cement receiving vat.<p>

<p>

"Taste it," Monsieur Marquenet invited us, offering us glasses. With him, we
dipped into the cloudy mout, as this first juice is called, and drank. It was
sweet and mellow.<p>

<p>

We were ready to return to the house but Monsieur Marquenet, with a twinkle in
his eye, asked us to wait. He disappeared into one of the grottoes at the rear
of the cave and emerged with a dusty bottle in his hand. Placing the rinsed
glasses on the top of a wine cask, he filled one for each.<p>

<p>

"An aperitif before dejeuner," he declared and, lifting his glass, added, "A
votre sante." Gravely we responded, "A votre sante."<p>

<p>

It was the prized Vouvray '47, golden, clear, and fragrant, a delight to eyes
and tongue and nostrils. The blissful look on Rose's face, I was sure, matched
my own.<p>

<p>

"A drink for the gods," she said to our host.<p>

<p>

"A drink for men," he corrected her, smiling. He held the glass up against the
light of the open door of the cave. "Here in Touraine," he said, "wine like
this is called the sun in the bottle."<p>

<p>

Warmed by the wine, by his courtesy, by a feeling of shared friendliness and
comradeship, we went to the house for dejeuner. Like the others, we washed our
hands at the outdoor pump and dried them on a towel that hung at the kitchen
door. The girls slipped their feet out of their sabots and put on their
espadrilles, the men wiped their shoes with a cloth and so did we. At the table
sat a young man and woman, the two other vendangeurs who had arrived during the
morning. We were introduced to them, Monsieur and Madame Leroux--George and
Marie, as they later became for us.<p>

<p>

On the hearth, in the marmite hanging from the crane, a soup was simmering; on
the wood stove, a savory lamb stew was bubbling in an iron pot. We sniffed it
with deep appreciation as we passed to our places.<p>

<p>

After we had eaten heartily, Monsieur Marquenet rose from the table, a squat,
gnomelike little figure, and settled his cap, which he had worn throughout the
meal, more firmly on his head. "Eh bien," he said, "to work." He turned to us.
"You will remain here for the afternoon, Mesdemoiselles?"<p>

<p>

"Mais non," we declared. "We are going."<p>

<p>

"Bon."<p>

<p>

George, the newcomer, came with us; his wife stayed behind to help in the
kitchen. As we snipped the grapes, we listened with pleasure to the chatter,
drinking in the atmosphere, smelling the vines, the earth, the clear air. It
took a little more effort now to keep up with Rene's clockwork, for the
unaccustomed labor began telling on us. The others, habituated to the work,
usually had their pails full when he arrived with his basket, slung like a
papoose across his broad back, but we kept our noses to the grapevines up to
the last moment. The respite of standing up and dumping the pail held comfort
and relief. My back ached; I was sure that Rose, moving along her haunches like
a slow-motion Russian dancer, was equally weary. But to cry quits before the
work was done would have shamed us.<p>

<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>4.</font></b><p>

<p>

The sun was setting when we again returned to the cave. This time, we accepted
the invitation to ride in the charrette, crowding in with some of the others
between the barrels. Other charrettes, equally laden with grapes and
vendangeurs, passed us on the road and friendly greetings were exchanged.
Etienne and Claude, now more at ease with us, indulged in a bit of horseplay
with the girls, crushing a cluster of grapes in their faces or pushing their
noses into the barrels of mash.<p>

<p>

The casks were emptied into the press, and Monsieur Marquenet, Rene, and Henri,
standing on the cement platform, assembled the crushing equipment. First went a
number of planks, cut to make a circular cover over the grapes. On top of this,
wooden weights, oak blocks a foot and a half thick, were placed, the wooden
wheel was then lowered, and the men, standing in front and at the sides of the
platform and grasping the spokes, began turning it. Synchronizing their
strength and motions, they pushed and jolted the heavy wheel, screwing it
tighter and tighter against the lid of the press. In a steady, gushing stream,
the mout poured into the vat. When, with all their straining efforts, the men
could no longer budge the wheel, they stopped.<p>

<p>

The first pressing was over. There would be another that evening after supper.
The wheel, weights, and lid would be lifted, the crushed mash would be dug up
and loosened, and after the second pressing the juice would be pumped into the
casks. Monsieur Marquenet explained the processes of wine-making to us while he
busied himself with his tasks. Something that looked like a thermometer he
lowered into a glassful of juice and, together with Rene, read its markings. It
was an instrument for measuring sugar content. The higher the sugar, the
greater the alcoholic strength of the wine. He seemed satisfied with the
reading. "Not as good as '47," he commented. "But it will make good average
wine."<p>

<p>

Rose and I left the cave before the others because we were eager to rest a
little before supper. Before we went, Monsieur Marquenet set up the glasses for
an evening aperitif of his Vouvray. <p>

<p>

It was eight before Patou's barking announced the return of the men. We heard
them washing up at the pump and then they came in and we sat down to supper. It
consisted of a soup thickened with tapioca, a delicious veal stew flavored with
thyme, bay leaf, garlic, and parsley, after which came potatoes, salad, cheese.
And of course there was plenty of red and white wine and quantities of bread.<p>

<p>

We were happily full of good food, good wine, and good cheer. In spite of the
work still to be done at the cave, there was no hurry in eating and drinking. A
meal was a ritual to be performed with respect and leisure. Only Claude did not
share in the talk. He had fallen asleep, his head resting on his outstretched
arm on the table.<p>

<p>

We were tired too, but we had vowed that we would stay up to watch the second
process of winemaking. It was late when we started to the cave, flashing our
way along the black winding road. The smell of wine hung in the night air; dim
lights gleamed from the mouths of other wine caves that we passed; there was
the sound of barrels being moved, the hum of voices of men engaged in labor.<p>

<p>

Quickly the men set to work. While Monsieur Marquenet, Rene, and Henri took the
press apart, lifting wheel and weights, George and Etienne began pumping into
casks the juice that had accumulated in the vat. The mechanical aids were few
and primitive. A hand crank lifted the large wheel; a hand pump filled the
barrels.<p>

<p>

The weights were lifted from the press, and Rene and Henri, armed with
pitchforks, stepped into the press and began loosening the tightly packed pulp.
Startled as we were, we made no comment as we watched Rene and Henri standing
in the pulp in their heavy, muddy sabots. Nor did we say anything when, the
pulp loosened, Henri swept up the door in front of the press where some of the
crushed grapes had fallen and threw the contents back into the press. Again the
weights were lowered, again the wheel was laboriously turned, and again the
juice poured into the vat.<p>

<p>

"What happens to the residue after the second pressings we asked Monsieur
Marquenet. "Do you throw it away?"<p>

<p>

"Mais non," he said. " It is out of that we make our cognac. You will see."<p>

<p>

When the weights were lifted, Rene and Henri again stepped into the press, this
time with shovels as well as pitchforks. The pulp, almost dry to the touch,
made up of grape skins, seeds, and stems, was loosened with the pitchforks and
then shoveled into a wheelbarrow. From there it was packed into cement vats
lining one wall of the cave. Again, what had fallen on the dirt floor was swept
up and thrown in with the rest. To pack the pulp down tightly, the men pounded
it with a heavy root of a tree, trimmed and rounded to make a giant mallet.<p>

<p>

The full vats were sealed with a thick layer of mixed cement. This rich residue
would ferment throughout the winter and in the spring would be distilled into
the colorless cognac.<p>

<p>

With a quiet word, a quiet gesture, Monsieur Marquenet directed the labors and
participated in them, heaving the wooden wheel, testing the mout, pumping the
juice into casks, tapping the barrels with practiced fingers to see how full
they were. Making white wine, he told us, was a more difficult process than
making red. With the latter, once the juice is pumped into the barrels, the
work is practically finished. In the spring, the wine is ready for bottling.
White wine, on the other hand, must be cleansed periodically. Every month for
five months, the wine in each cask is siphoned off into a clean, freshly
hosed-out cask. By the time it reaches the fifth change, it is free of sediment
and discoloration and holds the golden clarity of sunlight.<p>

<p>

By Saturday night, when a week's work was finished, there would be five
thousand liters of new Vouvray in the barrels. Sunday would be a day of rest,
then two more days of labor and the vendange would be over.<p>

<p>

The last day of the vendange was gay. Mounted on the charrette, we returned
from the vineyards singing. At the cave, Josette and Laure solemnly presented
Monsieur Marquenet with a bouquet of flowers they had picked for the occasion,
a gift of appreciation for the patron that is part of the ritual of closing a
vendange. Gravely, he thanked them and then opened several bottles of fine
Vouvray.<p>

<p>

In the kitchen, the berlot was waiting us, the traditional feast that marks the
end of a vendange. Never shall we forget the food and the spirit of the berlot.
It was a Thanksgiving and Christmas feast rolled into one, with a variety of
fine wines that gave it its French essence and character. Hors d'oeuvres served
with red wine, a thick cream soup, fricassee of chicken, a leg of lamb, roast
chicken, potatoes, creamed cauliflower, green beans that had been fished out of
preserving bottles, and Vouvray '33, '37, '42, '47. A dessert of applesauce and
petits fours was followed by coffee and cognac. <p>

<p>

Our contribution, very modest but highly appreciated, was a treasured package
of American cigarettes which we had saved for a special occasion. Through a
haze of American tobacco smoke, Monsieur Marquenet rose and offered a toast to
the Etats-Unis. And in return, we offered one to la belle France.<p>

<p>

We remained at the table, drinking, talking, toasting each other until late in
the afternoon. Finally, the dishes and glasses were cleared away and a hush of
expectancy which we did not understand filled the room. Solemnly, Monsieur
Marquenet pulled out his wallet. The time for paying wages had arrived. Eight
days at 195 francs a day for the grape pickers, more for the men who worked in
the cave. Together with the others, we received our money, 1560 francs.<p>

<p>

That evening there were only five of us at the table, the Marquenets, Etienne,
and we. It was over, the wonderful time of working, wine-tasting, making
friends. Our hearts were heavy at the thought of our departure; never,
throughout our stay in France, had we been so happy. We looked at the two
elderly people and had no words for our gratitude and affection and respect.
Instinctive and native to them were their courtesy, their dignity, their
generosity of spirit. In a hundred subtle ways they had made us feel at home
with them, helped us bridge the gap between different lands, different
backgrounds, different manners.<p>

<p>

They had parting gifts for us when we left the next morning--a package of
goats' cheese and butter from Madame Marquenet, two bottles of Vouvray '47 from
Monsieur Marquenet. With our eyes misting, we kissed each of them on both
cheeks in farewell. Then Etienne trundled our luggage in the wheelbarrow to the
bus stop, and we were off.

	<font size=5>I</font>n a previous article, entitled 'The Defeat of the Schools,' which appeared in
the March *Atlantic*, I developed at some length the simple but dismaying
proposition that actual and effective standards in American public education
are deplorably and inexcusably low. This assertion is buttressed by a vast
assemblage of facts and findings, accumulated over many years by educational
research, some of which I cited. The work is not readily accessible to anyone
but the specialist. It is dull, uninviting, microscopic, and calls for critical
scrutiny. One must take in a great deal of it at a bird's-eye view before its
full import becomes clear. But, once comprehended, it is highly dramatic. The
situation revealed is enormously worse than any layman is apt to imagine. We go
through a set of complicated and costly motions called 'teaching' algebra,
geometry, physics, chemistry, history, English, Latin, and so forth. And what
happens? Almost nothing at all! This may seem incredible. But it is true. The
subjects are 'taught.' But they are not being learned.<p>

<p>

Such a survey forces upon one inevitable questions: What is wrong? What can be
done about it? It is the purpose of this paper to suggest an answer. In
particular I wish to call attention to a very comprehensive solution of the
problem of school reform which is coming to be known as the general-education
movement. Lest anyone anticipate another panacea, let me hasten to say that
workers in this field are decidedly restive at the suggestion that they really
constitute a 'movement' at all. The word is used only because no one can think
of a better. They know full well that America has been oversold on pedagogical
gadgets which never perform up to expectations, and they themselves have no
patent medicine to recommend. Moreover this 'movement' which objects to being
called a movement is not an affair of a few specially favored schools where
money is no object and pretty theories grow like weeds. A great many serious
and practical people, up against the daily problems of education in
public-school systems, undergraduate departments of universities, and colleges
all over the country, have been taking stock of the situation, and have not
found it good. Within recent years they have been discovering themselves in
substantial agreement about where the trouble really lies and what ought to be
done about it. Many of them, often unknown to one another, have been developing
new and promising plans of operation which, when compared, have striking
identities. There has been a coming together of minds, a consensus; and it is
only in this sense that the evolving pattern, though novel and definite enough,
can be called a 'movement.' (Notice the avoidance of capitals!)<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>I.</font></b><p>

<p>

The general-education movement, like all sound and hopeful beginnings, is a
plagiarism and expansion of the past. The large and growing group of workers on
whom the idea has dawned have a common starting point which is far from new.
They have begun by rediscovering for themselves that education really matters.
Old stuff, you may say, and fit only for commencement addresses? Well, perhaps!
But what if one really takes the idea seriously, and brings it into contact
with the lamentable spectacle of education as it now is? Then, surely, one may
expect something drastic and perhaps not unexciting to happen.<p>

<p>

To people who have caught and are catching the general education idea it seems
manifest that in a democratic civilization the supreme urgency is for every
individual effectively to inherit, possess, enjoy, and use his birthright of
culture. This, to be sure, is an old thought. It is an expansion of the
traditional American insistence that a free electorate must be an educated
electorate. But the implications of that well-worn doctrine carry far beyond
the limits of civic or electoral responsibility in the narrow sense. The
resources of human culture, accumulated through the ages by the spirit of man,
alone make possible a human way of living, whether in the home, in industry and
commerce, in the spheres of religion and recreation, or in politics. Only the
man who possesses them is capable of freedom, of living constructively in a
nexus of free institutions.<p>

<p>

But such values can come only from an education which consists in learning, in
mastery, in growing insight, in standards which really operate, and not just in
going to school. So when multitudes of young people accumulate credits, pass
courses, carry off elegant sheepskins, and come out knowing little or nothing,
it is simply intolerable. Culture is not elegance or ornament. It is the very
stuff of free and democratic living--infinitely too important to be handled in
any such cavalier and essentially dishonest fashion. When the patient toil of
educational research unmistakably demonstrates that the average pupil in school
fails to learn even though he succeeds in passing, that culture is not
penetrating the minds of millions of young Americans in spite of all that is
being done, it is no small matter. On the contrary, a disastrous lesion has
been revealed in the body politic, a choking off of the vital spiritual force
which is ultimately the only drive for a free society.<p>

<p>

When the worker in general education turns to the psychologist he learns
immediately and with emphasis that all this need not be. There is nothing in
the constitution of the human mind which prevents any average boy or girl from
really coming to terms with any one of the great segments of human culture. It
has been shown that a genuine and serviceable grasp of a foreign language can
be gained in a good deal less time than many high-school pupils take to learn
nothing worth while about it. English style can be improved; a love of
literature can be inculcated; a mastery of mathematical thinking can be
developed; an understanding of science can be built up, historical or aesthetic
insights can be acquired. Nothing, indeed, seems more certain than that the
average human being is capable of immensely diversified learning, and that he
can learn very rapidly and surely, with the enthusiasm which comes only from
speed and conscious success, given the right conditions and the right kind of
direction. The right conditions and the right kind of direction! This is what
has been lacking, and not some special, unique, and unattainable quality of
mind. The defeat of the schools in their major task of enabling the individual
to inherit his cultural birthright has been self-inflicted.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>II.</font></b><p>

<p>

So one may say that the general-education movement begins as a discontent and a
faith, both rooted solidly in ascertained fact--a recognition that a great and
urgent task is not being accomplished, and a reasoned belief that it can be.
But also it is more than this. While the workers associated with it are usually
suspicious of panaceas, they are largely agreed in diagnosing our educational
troubles, and also as to the kind of measures which ought to be taken. Let us
begin with the diagnosis.<p>

<p>

As these men and women have come to see the matter, the great source of
weakness in conventional school education is that it has been dominated by the
specialist. Here is at least a hint of why the term GENERAL education has come
into use, and of some of its implications. Now the specialist is concerned with
the CREATION of cultural materials--with discoveries in the laboratory, new
historical and social interpretations, the composition of works of art and
literature, and the like. Indeed the very raison d'etre of specialization is
that it is essential for such tasks. In order to make any significant mark as a
musician, or a mathematician, or a chemist, or a historian, it is necessary to
stay within bounds; and there is a tendency for the bounds to become narrower
as the specialty becomes more effective. Wander through the various floors of
the Michael Pupin building at Columbia University, and you will find on the
doors the names of more different kinds of physics than most reasonably
well-educated people ever heard of. The successful promotion of the science of
physics has brought into being and is reciprocally supported by all this
immense and impressive division of labor.<p>

<p>

Obviously the specialist is a most admirable and necessary person in the
laboratory or the library or the studio. Society owes him an enormous debt. But
put him in the schoolroom and he is likely to begin playing the part of the
bull in the china shop. He is in the position of a good production engineer
suddenly shunted into salesmanship. It is not his metier. If he is to function
at all well he must, for the nonce, stop being a specialist altogether. For the
production or creation of culture calls for one kind of disposition and
attitude, and the distribution of culture quite another.<p>

<p>

Of course the specialist rarely invades the public-school classroom in his own
proper person. But he gets there just the same, and exercises a dominating
influence that is nearly always unfortunate. He does this through the textbook
he has written, through the course of study on which he has advised, and above
all through the teacher who has 'majored' in his field, and who can imagine
nothing sweeter in life than to become a specialist himself. Here is
approximately how he goes to work.<p>

<p>

Professor Jones is a distinguished member of the mathematics department of
Brook University. He is approached by a publishing house with the proposal that
he prepare a textbook in algebra for ninth-grade pupils. The idea is somewhat
distasteful, because it will take him from research, and he regards research as
much more important than helping any number of ninth-graders. But he has a
summer home which seems to swallow money endlessly, and so with a sigh he
consents. What should go into the textbooks. Well, obviously, the elements of
algebra. He has a well-marked trail to follow, worn smooth by the feet of many
a specialist before him. There must be the fundamental operations, the use of
brackets, factorization, the management of fractions, logarithms, equations up
to and including simple quadratics, arithmetic and geometric proressions, some
graphs. Perhaps he makes a few additions and introduces timid variants of his
own. A novelty here and there helps sales, and certainly cannot do much harm
even when touted as the latest educational wrinkle. The job--a hack job, for
all that it may be faithfully done--is soon put through, and he returns with
relief to his more important labors, and awaits his royalty checks. This is not
an unfair picture of how a great many textbooks are 'made,' and how the
intellectual content to be taught to (but not learned by) American boys and
girls is determined and laid out.<p>

<p>

To the worker in general education every last thing about it seems wrong. Think
of what Professor Jones is supposed to be doing. He ought to be doing what
Wells did when he wrote *The Outline of History*, what Durant did when he wrote
*The Story of Philosophy*, what Van Loon did when he wrote *The Arts*, what
Hogben did when he wrote *Mathematics for the Million*. Only, being a
professional scholar, he ought to do a better job than at least three of these
gentlemen. He is performing an act of cultural salesmanship. Surely this ought
to be no cause for the slight tinge of shame, or at least of deprecation, with
which he approaches his task. He has a glorious bill of goods--the noble
science of mathematics. He has a glorious public--young minds which need
enlightenment and which are sure to respond eagerly to the real thing if only
they can get it. How shall he make mathematics real, vital, helpful to them, as
it can and ought to be? This is his central problem. As an attack upon such a
problem his procedure is nothing less than pitiable. Out of the great and
fascinating cultural wealth of mathematical thought and discovery and
adventure, what items does he select? Those which appeal to the specialist as
important for the reason that they are convenient starting points for the
further study of his specialty. But most boys and girls are not going to
continue to the advanced study of mathematics, so that nearly all the items he
lays out are of no conceivable use or interest to them. That is their hard
luck, and not the responsibility of Professor Jones. His responsibility is to
the 'elements' of algebra, not the pupils.<p>

<p>

Here, as a vast number of workers associated with the general-education
movement or idea have come to see the matter, is the real cause of weakness,
the real reason why learning in school is so excessively poor and scanty. The
trouble lies in the sheer sterility of the cultural materials which specialists
hemmed in by their specialties have selected for boys and girls to learn. No
methods or tricks or devices can put these materials across effectively,
because the breath of life is not in them. When one tries to improve learning
by picayune devices which are supposed to be 'psychological'--printing the book
in the right kind of type, fixing up the right kind of exercises and reviews,
introducing pictures, projects, mastery units, and so on endlessly--one is
concentrating on essentially secondary matters which have neither meaning nor
effect unless a primary condition is fulfilled. One must obey the first and
great commandment, or all the rest of the law is empty sound and sheer
futility. The stuff itself must be manifestly worth while. It must come home to
the learner as something worth learning, or it will never be effectively and
permanently acquired.<p>

<p>

So the worker in general education has come to see himself as standing between
the specialists who create culture and the pupils who consume it. He has even,
with some covert apologies, coined a barbarous and yet not unexpressive name
for himself. In contrast to the specialist he tends to call himself a
'generalist.' That is to say, he seeks to serve the interests of the
public--the pupils--vis-a-vis the cultural resources which must be brought to
them and which they surely and sorely need. What items will be most suitable to
the young mind? What items will most surely and quickly help that mind to see
what a great subject is all about? The analogy of the salesman, again, is very
close. The factory experts and accountants will certainly know far more than he
about various phases and details of the manufacturing process. But he knows
something hidden from them, and contributes a point of view and technique
without which their labors would be for naught. He knows what the public is
willing and able to take, what it wants, what it needs. In exactly the same way
the educational 'generalist' sees himself as collaborating with the specialist
and the expert, and working up what he produces into educationally viable and
vital materials.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>III.</font></b><p>

<p>

Such is the diagnosis. What shall be the prescription?<p>

<p>

Once more let me emphasize that the general-education movement does not
advocate any standard panacea. If you were to visit the Pasadena High School,
the General College at the University of Minnesota, and Bennington College, you
would certainly find what on the surface seem very different educational
arrangements in operation. This is just as it should be, for a formula which is
supposed to fit all situations is almost certain, in reality, to suit none of
them. What is amazing, however, is the extent to which educational
'generalists' are agreed in principle as to what ought to be done. The essence
of their claim is that conventional school procedures urgently need to be
simplified and rationalized. The ordinary high-school or college curriculum is
made up of a large number of narrow courses. To the general educator it appears
that we should follow just the opposite tack, and make a curriculum out of a
much smaller number of broad ones. Essentially the idea is just as simple as
that. Yet it strikes down to the very roots of the educational problem.<p>

<p>

The system of narrow courses which has fastened itself upon the American
schools in the past fifty years is highly unfortunate in two ways. It poses a
whole row of insoluble educational riddles; and it is a perfect opportunity for
the specialist to do his worst.<p>

<p>

Here is a pupil confronted with a curriculum made up of courses in commercial
arithmetic, elementary statistics, elementary algebra, advanced algebra, plane
geometry, solid geometry, analytics, trigonometry ancient history, medaeval
history, history of the Renaissance, modern history, economic history, and so
on ad infinitum. What chance has he to make a wise choice, even with the best
of advice? It is as bad as one of those huge bills of fare which drive one
frantic trying to choose a reasonable meal. Must one study geometry to be an
educated man? Must one know about the Renaissance? What about the Industrial
Revolution, which seems to have a certain importance also? It would be nice to
take something on the appreciation of pictures, but a course on music would
also be good. Yet unfortunately French gets in the way of both. Try to get some
kind of reasonable order into such a melange.<p>

<p>

But suppose that we have before us a curricular scheme which offers a broad
course in science as such,--not physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and so
forth, but science as such,--taking as much time as two or three of the
conventional minor narrow sequences; and another of the same kind in
literature; and another in the social studies; and yet another in the arts.
There is some reason in this. It is all the difference between a bewildering a
la carte and a well-planned table d'hote. It has immediately the look of a
classification of cultural materials in terms of the interests and needs of the
ultimate consumer, whereas the other has not. No elaborate argument is
necessary to show that a person who is to live a free and effective life in a
world such as ours needs to have access to science, literature, the social
studies, and the arts, and to be aware of their relationship to his own daily
choices and concerns. This surely is what being educated means. A person who
has to teach elementary geometry or beginning Latin to a group of young people
often finds it necessary to use the most fantastic arguments in an effort to
answer the inevitable question: What's the good of studying this stuff? The
ordinary reply is that it 'trains the mind.' Yet after all, why might not
stenography or dishwashing do that particular trick just as well? But if he is
teaching the nature and structure of language as an instrument of expression
and thought, or the meaning of mathematical thinking in the affairs of men past
and present, or effective standards of aesthetic appraisal, or opening up the
riches of world literature, he is not likely to be up against such a
difficulty. There is a fundamental sanity about the broad, encyclopedic course
which strongly tends to convince the learner that here is something worth
having.<p>

<p>

Then again, the narrow course is the happy hunting ground of the specialist. If
we propose to teach geometry or French to young people, there is not much
alternative in what must be done, unless one is prepared to sabotage the whole
system and introduce all sorts of material which has no relationship to the
announced title of the course. We do exactly what Professor Jones did in
writing his algebra text; that is to say, we select the 'elements' of the
subject--its easier techniques, whose meaning and value reside in the fact that
they are the basis for further study. Some leeway can be found in the order of
topics to be treated, and even in the topics to be introduced. But they will
all tend to be preparatory in character, instead of immediately interesting and
important. This means that for the great majority of pupils, who will never go
much further, the whole thing is a total loss. What shall it profit me to be
told of a glorious view at the ten-thousand-foot level when it is quite certain
that the first thousand feet will be my limit?<p>

<p>

In contrast with this, the essence of the broad course is immediacy. I teach,
let us say, elementary plane geometry. In that case I am almost obligated to
spend a good deal of time on the congruence of triangles. The topic, perhaps,
has considerable value for those who are going to have some sort of
mathematical future. But this is certainly a minority.<p>

<p>

Could I, then, make a course which would consist entirely of topics of current
and immediate concern and importance, and which would still deserve to be
called elementary plane geometry? It would be something of a tour de force. But
suppose I am teaching a course in mathematics as such then indeed the situation
is different. Here is a vastly greater wealth of material from which I may
choose, and there are no arbitrary boundary lines beyond which I must not go.
It may be very hard to arrange a course which in its very structure and content
will show the average pupil that geometry as a specialized, delimited subject
matters much to him. It ought not to be hard to arrange a course to show him
the significance and fascination of mathematics.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>IV.</font></b><p>

<p>

Instead of algebra, geometry, trigonometry--Mathematics; instead of Latin,
French, German--Linguistics; instead of physics, chemistry, biology,
physiology--Science; instead of music, painting, sculpture, the dance--Art;
instead of economics, sociology, anthropology--Social Studies; instead of
English literature, classical literature, French literature--The Humanities.
This is a type picture of the rationalized and simplified scheme. The narrow
subdivisions are proper for the specialist and for the intending specialist.
The broad areas are proper for the generally educated person, whose interests
and needs are the concern of the 'generalist.' It should be understood that the
particular layout of broad areas here mentioned is not the only one possible.
As a matter of fact, it varies widely in different places. The conception
reaches its ultimate limits in the tutorial plan at the college level, and in
the so-called 'integrated curriculum' in the elementary school. But it need not
be, and usually is not, pushed so far. The basic claim is that it provides a
much readier access to living and significant cultural materials, and makes it
much easier for the learner to perceive the relationship of those materials to
the concerns of his own living, than the plan of innumerable small
pigeonholes.<p>

<p>

Anyone who supposes that the change is one of name alone and not of fact should
sit in for a while with a group of workers who are laying out courses along
these lines. He would quickly find out that he was wrong. For instance, at the
present time the General Education Board is financing nation-wide activities in
the development of Science as a broad and unified area of study. Those
responsible for the venture are drawing upon the scholarly resources of
world-famous specialists in the various scientific fields. But the general
scheme in which all are collaborating is made in the interest of the pupil who
will never be a scientific expert of any kind, and who yet needs scientific
insights if he is to live intelligently. New and vital materials for teaching
are being developed and made available. For instance, soil erosion is a problem
whose living importance it is not hard to show to almost anybody. Where would
it come in the setup of specialized courses? The answer is: Nowhere at all. But
under the new plan it can be utilized as a curricular topic, and a whole range
of insights from almost all the sciences can be concentrated upon it. The work
I mention is perhaps the most ambitious single job now being carried on by
persons associated with the general-education movement. But the same thing is
happening on a considerable scale in many places in connection with the arts,
the humanities, the social studies, and so forth. A widespread and practical
curricular renewal is under way. <p>

<p>

Teachers who come in contact with reorganizations of this kind usually feel a
quite special thrill of enthusiasm. So many beautiful iridescent bubbles have
been blown in the educational world, and they have usually burst so soon, that
we all tend to be rather suspicious of new proposals. But here, at least, is
something at once forwardlooking and practical. It represents advance, but one
has the sensation that one's feet are on the ground.<p>

<p>

What, after all, are teachers trying to do? What is it all about, anyhow? They
are, surely, distributors of culture--salesmen, if you will. They want to
select those cultural elements which matter most here and now, which have the
greatest immediate and intrinsic significance and appeal. They know that unless
the learner himself recognizes the legitimacy of what he is being asked to
learn no skill and no pressure will ever lead to satisfactory and permanantly
worthwhile results. The impediment has been an organization of material into
endless narrow subdivisions; and this has meant that the material itself has
been deprived of life and value.<p>

<p>

The very things most obviously worthy to be learned by everybody are just the
things that cannot be put in pigeonholes. But they can be put in large
compartments. Very well, let us abandon the pigeonholes. This is sure to bring
with it changes in the whole structure of education in America the nature of
which cannot yet be clearly envisaged. Our entire system depends upon the
concept of credits accumulated in limited courses. If you abandon the limited
courses, what about the precious credits? Nobody knows yet, but we shall find
out. The effective dissemination of a living culture is a matter far too urgent
to be blocked by any conventions or any fetishes or vested interests, however
well established. Simplification, rationalization, the provision of cultural
materials whose manifest significance is the chief dynamic in their
acquisition--this is the prevailing direction of American school reform
today.

	<font size=5>T</font>hroughout a considerable portion of the country the news of the Declaration of

Independence was accompanied by the news of a brilliant success at the South.

After the defeat of Macdonald at Moore's Creek, and the sudden arming of North

Carolina, Clinton did not venture to land, but cruised about in the

neighborhood, awaiting the arrival of Sir Peter Parker's squadron from Ireland.

Harassed by violent and contrary winds, Parker was three months in making the

voyage, and it was not until May that he arrived, bringing with him Lord

Cornwallis. As North Carolina had given such unmistakable evidence of its real

temper, it was decided not to land upon that coast for the present, but to go

South and capture Charleston and Savannah. Lord William Campbell, refugee

governor of South Carolina, urged that there was a great loyalist party in that

colony, which would declare itself as soon as the chief city should be in the

hands of the king's troops. That there would be any serious difficulty in

taking Charleston occurred to no one. But Colonel Moultrie had thrown up on

Sullivan's Island, commanding the harbor, a fortress of palmetto logs

strengthened by heavy banks of sand, and now held it wiht a force of twelve

hundred men, while five thousand militia were gathered about the town, under

command of General Charles Lee, who had been sent down to meet the emergency,

but did little more than to meddle and hinder. In his character of trained

European officer, Lee laughed to scorn Moultrie's palmetto stronghold, and

would have ordered him to abandon it, but that he was positively overruled by

Rutledge, president of the provincial congress, who knew Moultrie and relied

upon his sound judgment. The British commanders, Clinton and Parker, wasted

three weeks in discussing various plans of attack, while the Americans, with

spade and hatchet, were rapidly barring every approach to Charleston, and fresh

regiments came pouring in to man the new-built intrenchments. At last Clinton

landed three thousand men on a naked sand-bank, divided form Sullivan's Island

by a short space of shallow sea, which he thought could be forded at low tide.

At the proper time Sir Peter Parker was to open a furious fire from the fleet,

which it was expected would knock down the fort in a few minutes, while

Clinton, fording the shoals, would drive out the Americans at the point of the

bayonet. The shoals, however, turned out to be seven feet deep at low water,

and the task of the infantry was reduced to a desperate conflict with the

swarms of mosquitoes, which nearly drove them frantic. The battle thus became a

mere artillery duel between the fort and the fleet. The British fire was rapid

and furious, but ineffective. Most of the shot passed harmlessly over the low

fortress, and those which struck did no harm to its elastic structure. The

American fire was very slow, and few shots were wasted. The cable of Parker's

flagship was cut by a well-aimed ball, and the ship, swinging around, received

a raking fire which swept her deck with terrible slaughter. After the fight had

lasted ten hours the British retreated out of range. The palmetto fort had

suffered no serious injury, and only one gun had been silenced. The American

loss in killed and wounded was thirty-seven. On the other hand, Sir Peter's

flagship had lost her main-mast and mizzen-mast, and had some twenty shots in

her hull, so that she was little better than a wreck. The British loss in

killed and wounded was two hundred and five. Of their ten sails, only one

frigate remained seaworthy at the close of the action. After waiting three

weeks to refit, the whole expedition sailed away from New York to cooperate

with the Howes. Charleston was saved, and for more than two years the Southern

States were freed from the invader. In commemoration of this brilliant victory,

and of the novel stronghold which had so roused the mirth of the European

soldier of fortune, the outpost on Sullivan's Island has ever since been known

by the name of Fort Moultrie.<p>



<p>



It was with such tidings of good omen that the Declaration of Independence was

sent forth to he world. But it was the last news of victory that for the next

six months was to cheer the anxious statesmen assembled at Philadelphia. During

the rest of the summer and autumn disaster followed upon disaster, until it

might well seem as if fickle fortune had ceased to smile upon the cause of

liberty. The issue of the contest was now centred in New York. By conquering

and holding the line of the Hudson River, the British hoped to cut the United

Colonies in two, after which it was thought that Virginia and New England,

isolated from each other, might be induced to consider the error of their ways

and repent. Accordingly, General Howe was to capture the city of New York,

while General Carleton was to descend from Canada, recapture Ticonderoga, and

take possession of the upper waters of the Hudson, together with the Mohawk

valley. Great hopes were built upon the cooperation of the loyalists, of whom

there was a greater number in New York than in any other State, except perhaps

South Carolina. It was partly for this reason, as we shall hereafter see, that

these two States suffered more actual misery from the war than all the others

put together. The horrors of civil war were to be added to the attack of the

invader. Throughout the Mohawk valley the influence of Sir John Johnson, the

Tory son of the famous baronet of the Seven Years' War was thought to be

supreme; and it turned out to be very powerful both with the white population

and with the Indians. At the other end of the line, in New York city, the Tory

element was strong, for reasons already set forth. On Long Island, the people

of Kings and Queens counties, of Dutch descent, were Tories almost to a man,

while the English population of Suffolk was solidly in favor of independence.

And this instance of Long Island was typical. From one end of the United States

to the other, the Tory sentiment was strongest with the non-English element in

the population.<p>



<p>



Before beginning his attack on New York, General Howe had to await the arrival

of his brother; for the ministry had resolved to try the effect of what seemed

to them a "conciliatory policy." On the 12th of July Lord Howe arrived at

Staten Island, bringing with him the "olive-branch" which Lord North had

promised to send along with the sword. This curious specimen of political

botany turned out to consist of a gracious declaration that all persons who

should desist from rebellion and lend their "aid in restoring tranquillity"

would receive full and free pardon from their sovereign lord the king. As it

would not do to recognize the existence of Congress, Lord Howe inclosed this

declaration in a letter addressed to "George Washington, Esq.," and sent it up

the harbor with a flag of truce. But as George Washington, in his capacity of

Virginian landholder and American citizen, had no authority for dealing with a

royal commissioner, he refused to receive the letter. Colonel Reed informed

Lord Howe's messenger that there was no person in the army with that address.

The British officer reluctantly rowed away, but suddenly, putting his barge

about, he came back and inquired by what title Washington should be properly

addressed. Colonel Reed replied, "You are aware, sir, of the rank of General

Washington in our army?" "Yes, sir, we are," answered the officer; "I am sure

my Lord Howe will lament exceedingly this affair, as the letter is of a civil,

and not of a military nature. He greatly laments that he was not here a little

sooner." This remark was understood by Colonel Reed to refer to the Declaration

of Independence, which was then but eight days old. A week later Lord Howe sent

Colonel Patterson, the British adjutant-general, with a document now addressed

to "George Washington, Esq., etc. etc." Colonel Patterson begged for a personal

interview, which was granted. He was introduced to Washington, whom he

describes as a gentleman of magnificent presence and very handsomely dressed.

Somewhat overawed, and beginning his remarks with "May it please your

Excellency," Patterson explained that the etceteras on the letter meant

everything. "Indeed," said Washington, with a pleasant smile, "they might mean

anything." He declined to take the letter, but listened to Patterson's

explanations, and then replied that he was not authorized to deal with the

matter, and could not give his lordship any encouragement, as he seemed

empowered only to grant pardons, whereas those who had committed no fault

needed no pardons. As Patterson got up to go, he asked if his Excellency had no

message to send to Lord Howe. "Nothing," answered Washington "but my particular

compliments." Thus foiled in his attempt to negotiate with the American

commander, Lord Howe next inclosed his declaration in a circular letter

addressed to the royal governors of the Middle and Southern colonies; but as

most of these dignitaries were either in jail or on board the British fleet,

not much was to be expected from such a mode of publication. The precious

document was captured and sent to Congress, which derisively published it for

the amusement and instruction of the people. It was everywhere greeted with

jeers. "No doubt we all need pardon from Heaven," said Governor Trumbull, of

Connecticut, "for our manifold sins and transgressions; but the American who

needs the pardon of his Britannic Majesty is yet to be found." The only serious

effect produced was the weakening of the loyalist party. Many who had thus far

been held back by the hope that Lord Howe's intercession might settle all the

difficulties now came forward as warm supporter of independence as soon as it

became apparent that the king had really nothing to offer.<p>



<p>



The olive-branch having proved ineffectual, nothing was left but to unsheathe

the sword, and a most interesting campaign now began, of which the primary

object was to capture the city of New York and compel Washington's army to

surrender. The British army was heavily reinforced by the return of Clinton's

expedition and the arrival of 11,000 fresh troops from England and Germany.

General Howe had now more than 25,000 men at his disposal, fully equipped and

disciplined; while to oppose him Washington had but 18,000, many of them raw

levies which had just come in. If the American army had consisted of such

veterans as Washington afterwards led at Monmouth, the disparity of numbers

would still have told powerfully in favor of the British. As it was, in view of

the crudeness of his material, Washington could hardly hope to do more with his

army than to make it play the part of a detaining force. To keep the field in

the face of overwhelming odds is one of the most arduous of military problems,

and often calls for a higher order of intelligence than that which is displayed

in the mere wining of battles. Upon this problem Washington was now to be

employed for six months without respite, and it was not long before he gave

evidence of military genius such as has seldom been surpassed in the history of

modern warfare. At the outset the city of New York furnished the kernel of the

problem. Without control of the water it would be well-nigh impossible to hold

the city. Still there was a chance, and it was the part of a good general to

take this chance, and cut out as much work as possible for the enemy. The shore

of Manhattan Island was girded with small forts and redoubts, which Lee had

erected in the spring before his departure for South Carolina. The lower end of

the island, along the line of Wall Street, was then but little more than half

its present width, as several lines of the street have since been added upon

both sides. From Corlandt Street across to Paulus Hook, the width of the Hudson

River was not less than two miles, while the East River near Fulton Ferry was

nearly a mile in width. The city reached only from the Battery as far as

Chatham Street, whence the Bowery Lane ran northwestwardly to Bloomingdale

through a country smiling with orchards and gardens. Many of the streets were

now barricaded, and a strong line of redoubts ran across from river to river

below the side of Canal Street. At the upper end of the island, and on the

Jersey shore, were other fortresses, with which we shall shortly have to deal,

and out in the harbor, as a sort of watch-tower from which to inspect the

enemy's fleet, a redoubt had been raised on Governor's Island, and was

commanded by Colonel Prescott, with a party of the men of Bunker Hill.<p>



<p>



In order to garrison such various positions, it was necessary for Washington to

scatter his 18,000 men; and this added much to the difficulty of his task, for

Howe could at any moment strike at almost any one of these points with his

whole force. From the nature of the case the immense advantage of the

initiative belonged entirely to Howe. But in one quarter, the most important of

all, Washington had effected as much concentration of his troops as was

possible. The position on Brooklyn Heights was dangerously exposed, but it was

absolutely necessary for the Americans to occupy it if they were to keep their

hold upon New York. This eminence commanded New York exactly as Bunker Hill and

Dorchester Heights commanded Boston. Green had, accordingly, spent the summer

in fortifying it, and there 9000 men--one half of the army--were now

concentrated under command of Putnam. Upon this exposed position General Howe

determined to throw nearly the whole of his force. He felt confident that the

capture or destruction of half the American army would so discourage the rebels

as to make them lend a readier ear to the overtures of that excellent

peacemaker, his brother. Accordingly, on the 22d of August, General Howe landed

20,000 men at Gravesend Bay. From this point the American position was

approachable by four roads, two of which crossed a range of densely wooded

hills, and continued through the villages of Bedford and Flatbush. To the left

of these the Gowanus road followed the shore about the western base of the

hills, while on the right the Jamaica road curved inland and turned their

eastern base.<p>



<p>



The elaborate caution with which the British commander now proceeded stands out

in striking contrast with the temerity of his advance upon Bunker Hill in the

preceding year. He spent four days in reconnoitring, and then he sent his

brother, with part of the fleet, to make a feint upon New York, and occupy

Washington's attention. Before daybreak of the 27th, under the cover of this

feint, the British advance had been nearly completed. General Grant, with the

Highlands regiments, advanced along the coast road, where the American outposts

were held by William Alexander, of New Jersey, commonly known as Lord Stirling,

from a lapsed Scotch earldom to which he had claimed the title. The Hessians,

under General von Heister, proceeded along the Bedford and Flatbush roads,

which were defended by Sullivan; while more than half of the army, under Howe

in person, accompanied by Clinton, Percy and Cornwallis, accomplished a long

night march by the Jamaica road, in order to take the Americans in flank. This

long flanking march was completed in perfect secrecy because the people of the

neighborhood were in sympathy with the British, and it encountered no obstacles

because the American force was simply incapable of covering so much territory.

The divisions of Stirling and Sullivan contained the 5000 men which were all

that Putnam could afford to send forward from his works. A patrol which watched

the Jamaica road was captured early in the morning, but it would not in any

case have been possible to send any force there which could materially have

hindered the British advance. Overwhelming superiority in numbers enabled the

British to go where they pleased, and the battle was already virtually won when

they appeared on the Jamaica road in the rear of the village of Bedford.

Scarcely had the fight begun on the crest of the hill between Sullivan and the

Hessians in his front when he found himself assaulted in the rear. Thrown into

confusion, and driven back and forth through the woods between two galling

fires, his division was quickly routed, and nearly all were taken prisoners,

including the general himself. On the coast road the fight between Stirling and

Grant was the first in which Americans had ever met British troops in open

field and in regular line of battle. Against the sturdy Highland regiments

Stirling held his ground gallantly for four hours, until he was in turn

assaulted in the rear by Lord Cornwallis, after the rout of Sullivan. It now

became, with Stirling, simply a question of saving his division from capture,

and after a desperate fight his end was accomplished, and the men got back to

Brooklyn Heights, though the brave Stirling himself was taken prisoner. In this

noble struggle the highest honors were won by the brigade of Maryland men

commanded by Smallwood, and throughout the war we shall find this honorable

distinction of Maryland for the personal gallantry of her troops fully

maintained, until in the last pitched battle, at Eutaw Springs, we see them

driving the finest infantry of England at the point of the bayonet.<p>



<p>



The defeat of Sullivan and Stirling enabled Howe to bring up his whole army in

front of the works at Brooklyn Heights toward the close of the day. To complete

the victory it would be necessary to storm these works, but Howe's men were

tired with marching, if not with fighting, and so the incident known as the

battle of Long Island came to an end. A swift ship was at once dispatched to

England with the news of the victory, which was somewhat highly colored. It was

for a while supposed that there had been a terrible slaughter, but careful

research has shown that this was not the case. About 400 had been killed and

wounded on each side, and this loss had been incurred mainly in the fight

between Stirling and Grant. On other parts of the field the British triumph had

consisted chiefly in the scooping up of prisoners, of whom at least 1000 were

taken. The stories of a wholesale butcher by the Hessians which once were

current have been completely disproved. Washington gave a detailed account of

the affair a few days afterward, and the most careful investigation has shown

that he was correct in every particular. But to the American public the blow

was none the less terrible, while in England the exultation served as an offset

to the chagrin felt after the loss of Boston and the defeat at Fort Moultrie,

and it was naturally long before facts could be seen in their true proportions.

<p>



<p>



Heavy as was the blow, however, General Howe's object was still but half

attained. He had neither captured nor destroyed the American forces on Long

Island, but had only driven them into their works. He was still confronted by

8000 men on Brooklyn Heights, and the problem was how to dislodge them. In the

evening Washington came over from New York, and made everything ready to resist

a storm. To this end, on the next day, he brought over reinforcements, raising

his total force within the works to 10,000 men. Under such circumstances, if

the British had attempted a storm, they would probably have been repulsed with

great slaughter. But Howe had not forgotten Bunker Hill, and he thought it best

to proceed by way of siege. As soon as Washington perceived this intention of

his adversary, he saw that he must withdraw his army. He would have courted a

storm, in which he was almost sure to be victorious, but he shrank from a

siege, in which he was quite sure to lose his whole force. The British troops

now invested him in a semicircle, and their ships might at any moment close in

behind and cut off his only retreat. Accordingly, sending trusty messengers

across the river, Washington collected every sloop, yacht, fishing-smack, yawl,

scow, or row-boat that could be found in either water from the Battery to

King's Bridge or Hell-Gate; and after nightfall of the 29th, these craft were

all assembled at the Brooklyn ferry, and wisely manned by the fishermen of

Marblehead and Gloucester from Glover's Essex regiment, experts, every one of

them, whether at oar or sail. All through the night the American troops were

ferried across the broad river, as quietly as possible and in excellent order,

while Washington superintended the details of the embarkation, and was himself

the last man to leave the ground. At seven o'clock in the morning the whole

American army had landed on the New York side, and had brought with them all

their cannon, small arms, ammunition, tools, and horses, and all their larder

besides, so that when the bewildered British climbed into the empty works they

did not find so much as a biscuit or a glass of rum wherewith to console

themselves.<p>



<p>



This retreat has always been regarded as one of the most brilliant incidents in

Washington's career, and it would certainly be hard to find a more striking

example of vigilance. Had Washington allowed himself to be cooped up on

Brooklyn Heights he would have been forced to surrender; and whatever was left

of the war would have been a game played without queen, rook, or bishop. For

this very reason it is hardly creditable to Howe that he should have let his

adversary get away so easily. At daybreak, indeed, the Americans had been

remarkably favored by the sudden rise of a fog which covered the East River,

but during the night the moon had shone brightly, and one can only wonder that

the multitudinous plash of oars and the unavoidable murmur of ten thousand men

embarking, with their heavy guns and stores, would not have attracted the

attention of some wakeful sentinel, either on shore or on the fleet. A storming

party of British, at the right moment, would at least have disturbed the

proceedings. So rare a chance of ending the war at a blow was never again to be

offered to the British commanders. Washington now stationed the bulk of his

army along the line of the Harlem River, leaving a strong detachment in the

city under Putnam; and presently, with the same extraordinary skill which he

had just displayed in sending boats under the very eyes of the fleet, he

withdrew Colonel Prescott and his troops from their exposed position on

Governor's Island, which there was no longer any reason for holding.<p>



<p>



Hoping that the stroke just given by the British sword might have weakened the

obstinacy of the Americans, Lord Howe again had recourse to the olive-branch.

The captured General Sullivan was sent to Congress to hold out hopes that Lord

Howe would use his influence to get all the obnoxious acts of Parliament

repealed, only he would first like to confer with some of the members of

Congress informally and as with mere private gentlemen. A lively debate ensued

upon this proposal, in which some saw an insult to Congress, while all quite

needlessly suspected treachery. John Adams, about whom there was so much less

of the suaviter in modo that of the fortiter in re, alluded to Sullivan, very

unjustly, as a "decoy duck," who had better have been shot in the battle than

employed on such a business. It was finally voted that no proposals of peace

from Great Britain should receive notice, unless they should be conveyed in

writing, and should explicitly recognize Congress as the legal representative

of the American States. For this once, however out of personal regard for Lord

Howe, and that nothing might be disdained which really looked toward a peaceful

settlement, they would send a committee to Staten Island to confer with his

lordship, who might regard this committee in whatever light he pleased. In this

shrewd, half-humorous method of getting rid of the diplomatic difficulty, one

is forcibly reminded of President Lincoln's famous proclamation addressed "To

whom it may concern." The committee, consisting of Franklin, Rutledge, and John

Adams, were hospitably entertained by Lord Howe, but their conference came to

nothing, because the Americans now demanded a recognition of their independence

as a condition which must precede all negotiation. There is no doubt that Lord

Howe, who was a warm friend to the Americans and a most energetic opponent of

the king's policy, was bitterly grieved at this result. As a last resort he

published a proclamation announcing the intention of the British government to

reconsider the various acts and instructions by which the Americans had been

annoyed, and appealing to all right-minded people to decide for themselves

whether it were not wise to rely on a solemn promise like this, rather than

commit themselves to the dangerous chances of an unequal and unrighteous war.<p>



<p>



Four days after this futile interview General Howe took possession of New York.

After the loss of Brooklyn Heights, Washington and Greene were already aware

that the city could not be held. Its capture was very easily effected. Several

ships-of-the-line ascended the Hudson as far as Bloomingdale, and the East

River as far as Blackwell's Island; and while thus from either side these

vessels swept the northern part of Manhattan with a furious fire, General Howe

brought his army across from Brooklyn in boats and landed at Kipp's Bay, near

the present site of East Thirty-Fourth Street. Washington came promptly down,

with two New England brigades, to reinforce the men whom he had stationed at

that point, and to hinder the landing of the enemy until Putnam should have

time to evacuate the city. To Washington's wrath and disgust, these men were

seized with panic, and suddenly turned and fled without firing a shot. Had Howe

now thrown his men promptly forward across the line of Thirty-Fourth Street, he

would have cut off Putnam's retreat from the city. But what the New England

brigades failed to do a bright woman succeeded in accomplishing. When Howe had

reached the spot known as Murray Hill, now the centre of much brownstone

magnificence in Park and Madison and Fifth avenues, at that time a noble

country farmstead, Mrs. Lindley Murray, mother of the famous grammarian, well

knowing the easy temper of the British commander, sent out a servant to invite

him to stop and take luncheon. A general halt was ordered; and while Howe and

his officers were gracefully entertained for more than two hour by their

accomplished and subtle hostess, Putnam hastily marched his 4000 men up the

shore of the Hudson, until, passing Bloomingdale, he touched the right wing of

the main army, and was safe, though his tents, blankets, and heavy guns had

been left behind. The American lines now extended from the mouth of Harlem

River across the island, and on the following day the British attempted to

break through their centre at Harlem Heights; but the attack was repulsed, with

a loss of sixty Americans and three hundred British, and the lines just formed

remained, with very little change, for nearly four weeks.<p>



<p>



General Howe had thus got possession of the city of New York, but the conquest

availed him little so long as the American army stood across the island, in the

attitude of blockading him. If this campaign was to decide the war, as the

ministry hoped, nothing short of the capture or dispersal of Washington's army

would suffice. But the problem was now much harder than it had been at

Brooklyn. For as the land above Manhattan Island widens rapidly to the north

and east, it would not be easy to hem Washington in by sending forces to his

rear. As soon as he should find his position imperiled, he would posses the

shorter line by which to draw his battalions together and force an escape, and

so the event proved. Still, with Howe's superior force and with his fleet, if

he could get up the Hudson to the rear of the American right, and at the same

time land troops from the Sound in the rear of the American left, it was

possible that Washington might be compelled to surrender. There was nothing to

bar Howe's passage up the East River to the sound; but at the northern

extremity of Manhattan Island the ascent of the Hudson was guarded on the east

by Fort Washington, under command of Putnam, and on the west by Fort Lee,

standing on the summit of the lofty cliffs known as the palisades, and

commanded by Greene. It was still doubtful, however, whether these two

strongholds could effectually bar the ascent of so broad a river, and for

further security Putnam undertook to place obstructions in the bed of the

stream itself. Both the continental Congress and the State Convention of New

York were extremely unwilling that these two fortresses should in any event be

given up, for in no case must the Hudson River be abandoned. Putnam and Greene

thought that the forts could be held, but by the 9th of October it was proved

that they could not bar the passage of the river, for on that day two frigates

ran safely between them, and captured some small American craft a short

distance above. This point having been ascertained, General Howe, on the 12th,

leaving Percy in command before Harlem Heights, moved the greater part of his

army nine miles up the East River to Throg's Neck, a peninsula in the Sound,

separated from the mainland by a narrow creek and a marsh that was overflowed

at high tide. By landing here suddenly, Howe hoped to get in Washington's rear

and cut him off from his base of supply in Connecticut. But Washington had

foreseen the move and forestalled it. When Howe arrived a Throg's Neck, he

found the bridge over the creek destroyed, and the main shore occupied by a

force which it would be dangerous to try to dislodge by wading across the

marsh. While Howe was thus detained six days on the peninsula, Washington moved

his base to White Plains, and concentrated his whole army at that point,

abandoning everything on Manhattan Island except Fort Washington. Sullivan,

Stirling, and Morgan, who had just been exchanged, now rejoined the army, and

Lee also arrived from South Carolina.<p>



<p>



By this movement to White Plains, Washington had foiled Howe's attempt to get

in his rear, and the British general decided to try the effect of an attack in

front. On the 28th of October he succeeded in storming an outpost at Chatterton

Hill, losing 229 lives, while the Americans lost 140. But this affair, which is

sometimes known as the battle of white Plains, seems to have discouraged Howe.

Before renewing the attack he waited three days, thinking perhaps of Bunker

Hill; and on the last night of October, Washington fell back upon North Castle,

where he took a position so strong that it was useless to think of assailing

him. Howe then changed his plans entirely, and moved down the east bank of the

Hudson to Dobb's Ferry, whence he could either attack Fort Washington, or cross

into New Jersey and advance upon Philadelphia, the "rebel capital." The purpose

of this change was to entice Washington from his unassailable position.<p>



<p>



To meet this new movement, Washington threw his advance of 5000 men, under

Putnam, into New Jersey, where they encamped near Hackensack; he sent Heath up

to Peekskill, with 3000 men, to guard the entrance to the Highlands; and he

left Lee at North Castle, with 7000 men, and ordered him to cooperate with him

promptly in whatever direction, as soon as the nature of Howe's plans should

become apparent. As Forts Washington and Lee detained a large force in

garrison, while they had shown themselves unable to prevent ships from passing

up the river, there was no longer any use in holding them. Nay, they had now

become dangerous, as traps in which the garrisons and stores might be suddenly

surrounded and captured. Washington accordingly resolved to evacuate them both,

while, to allay the fears of Congress in the event of a descent from Canada, he

ordered Heath to fortify that much more important position at West Point.<p>



<p>



Had Washington's orders been obeyed and his plans carried out, history might

still have recorded a retreat through "the Jerseys," but how different a

retreat from that which was now about to take place! The officious interference

of Congress, a venial error of judgment on the part of Greene, and gross

insubordination on the part of Lee, occurring all together at this critical

moment, brought about the greatest disaster of the war, and came within an ace

of overwhelming the American cause in total and irretrievable ruin. Washington

instructed Greene, who now commanded both fortresses, to withdraw the garrison

and stores from Fort Washington, and to make arrangements for evacuating Fort

Lee also. At the same time he did not give a positive order, but left the

matter somewhat within Greene's discretion, in case military circumstances of

an unforeseen kind should arise. Then, while Washington had gone up to

reconnoitre the site for the new fortress at West point, there came a special

order from Congress that Fort Washington should not be abandoned save under

direst extremity. If Greene had thoroughly grasped Washington's view of the

case, he would have disregarded this conditional order, for there could hardly

be worse extremity than that which the sudden capture of the fortress would

entail. But Greene's mind was not quite clear; he believed that the fort could

be held, and he did not like to take the responsibility of disregarding a

message from Congress. In this dilemma, he did the worst thing possible: he

reinforced the doomed garrison, and awaited Washington's return. <p>



<p>



When the commander-in-chief returned, on the 14th, he learned with dismay that

nothing had been done. But it was now too late to mend matters, for that very

night several British vessels passed up between the forts, and the next day

Howe appeared before Fort Washington with an overwhelming force and told

Colonel Magaw, the officer in charge, that if he did not immediately surrender

the whole garrison would be put to the sword. Magaw replied that he would fight

as long as breath was left in his body, and if Howe wanted his fort he must

come and take it. On the 16th, after a sharp struggle, in which the Americans

fought with desperate gallantry, though they were outnumbered more than five to

one, the works were carried, and the whole garrison was captured. The victory

cost the British more than 500 men in killed and wounded. The Americans,

fighting behind their works, lost but 150; but they surrendered 3000 of the

best troops in their half-trained army, together with an immense quantity of

artillery and small arms. It was not in General Howe's kindly nature to carry

out his savage threat of the day before; but some of the Hessians, maddened

with the stubborn resistance they had encountered, began murdering their

prisoners in cold blood, until they were sharply called to order. From fort

Lee, on the opposite bank of the river, Washington surveyed this woeful

surrender with his usual iron composure: but when it came to seeing his brave

men thrown down and stabbed to death by the cruel Hessian bayonets, his

overwrought heart could bear it no longer and he cried and sobbed like a

child.<p>



<p>



This capture of the garrison of Fort Washington was one of the most crushing

blows that befell the American arms during the whole course of the war.

Washington's retreat seemed now likely to be converted into a mere flight, and

a most terrible gloom overspread the whole country. The disaster was primarily

due to the interference of Congress. It might have been averted by prompt and

decisive action on the part of Greene. But Washington, whose clear judgment

made due allowance for all the circumstances, never for a moment cast any blame

upon his subordinate. The lesson was never forgotten by Greene, whose

intelligence was of that high order which may indeed make a first mistake, but

never makes a second. The friendship between the two generals became warmer

than ever. Washington, by a sympathetic instinct, had divined from the outset

the military genius that was by and by to prove scarcely inferior to his own.<p>



<p>



Yet worse remained behind. Washington had but 6000 men on the Jersey side of

the river, and it was now high time for Lee to come over from North Castle and

join him, with the force of 7000 that had been left under his command. On the

17th, Washington sent a positive order for him to cross the river at once; but

Lee dissembled, pretended to regard the order in the light of mere advice, and

stayed where he was. He occupied an utterly impregnable position: why should he

leave it, and imperil a force with which he might accomplish something

memorable on his own account? By the resignation of General Ward, Lee had

become the senior major-general of the Continental army, and in the event of

disaster to Washington he would almost certainly become commander-in-chief. He

had returned from South Carolina more arrogant and loud-voiced than ever. The

Northern people knew little of Moultrie, while they supposed Lee to be a great

military light; and the charlatan accordingly got the whole credit of the

victory, which, if his precious advice had been taken, would never have been

won. Lee was called the hero of Charleston, and people began to contrast the

victory of Sullivan's island with the recent defeats, and to draw conclusions

very disparaging to Washington. From the beginning Lee had felt personally

aggrieved at not being appointed to the chief command, and now he seemed to see

a fair chance of ruining his hated rival. Should he come to the head of the

army in a moment of dire disaster to the Americans, it would be so much the

better, for it would be likely to open negotiations with Lord Howe, and Lee

loved to chaffer and intrigue much better than to fight. So he spent his time

in endeavoring, by insidious letters and lying whispers, to nourish the feeling

of affection toward Washington, while he refused to send a single regiment to

his assistance. Thus, through the villainy of this traitor in the camp,

Washington actually lost more men, so far as their present use was concerned at

this most critical moment, than he had been deprived of by all the blows which

the enemy had dealt him since the beginning of the campaign.<p>



<p>



On the night of the 19th, Howe threw 5000 men across the river, about five

miles above Fort Lee, and with this force Lord Cornwallis marched rapidly down

upon that stronghold. The place had become untenable and it was with some

difficulty that a repetition of the catastrophe of Fort Washington was avoided.

Greene had barely time, with his 2000 men, to gain the bridge over the

Hackensack and join the main army, leaving behind all his cannon, tents,

blankets, and eatables. The position now occupied by the main army, between the

Hackensack and Passaic rivers, was an unsafe one, in view of the great

superiority of the enemy in numbers. A strong British force, coming down upon

Washington from the north, might compel him to surrender or to fight at a great

disadvantage. To avoid this danger, on the 21st, he crossed the Passaic and

marched southwestward to Newark, where he stayed five days; and every day he

sent a messenger to Lee, urging him to make all possible haste in brining over

his half of the army, that they might be able to confront the enemy on

something like equal terms. Nothing could have been more explicit or more

peremptory than Washington's orders; but Lee affected to misunderstand them,

set excuses, raised objections, paltered, argued, prevaricated, and lied, and

so contrived to stay where he was until the first of December. To Washington he

pretended that his moving was beset by "obstacles," the nature of which he

would explain as soon as they should meet. But to James Bowdoin, president of

the executive council of Massachusetts, he wrote at the same time declaring

that his own army and that under Washington "must rest each on its own bottom."

He assumed command over Heath, who had been left to guard the Highlands, and

ordered him to send 2000 troops to reinforce the main army; but that officer

very properly refused to depart from the instructions which the

commander-in-chief had left with him. To various members of Congress Lee told

the falsehood that if HIS advice had only been heeded, Fort Washington would

have been evacuated ere it was too late; and he wrote to Dr. Rush, wondering

whether any of the members of Congress had ever studied Roman history, and

suggesting that he might do great things if he could only be made Dictator for

one week.<p>



<p>



Meanwhile Washington, unable to risk a battle, was rapidly retreating through

New Jersey. On the 28th of November Cornwallis advanced upon Newark, and

Washington fell back upon New Brunswick. On the 1st of December, as Cornwallis

reached the latter place, Washington broke down the bridge over the Raritan,

and continued his retreat to Princeton. The terms of service for which his

troops had been enlisted were now beginning to expire, and so great was the

discouragement wrought by the accumulation of disasters which had befallen the

army since the battle of Long Island that many of the soldiers lost heart in

their work. Homesickness began to prevail, especially among the New England

troops, and as their terms expired it was difficult to persuade them to

re-enlist. Under these circumstances the army dwindled fast, until by the time

he reached Princeton, Washington had but 3000 men remaining at his disposal.

The only thing to be done was to put the broad stream of the Delaware between

himself and the enemy, and this he accomplished by the 8th, carrying over all

his guns and stores, and seizing or destroying every boat that could be found

on that great river for many miles in either direction. when the British

arrived, on the evening of the same day, they found it impossible to cross.

Cornwallis was eager to collect a flotilla of boats as soon as practicable, and

push on to Philadelphia, but Howe, who had just joined him, thought it hardly

worth while to take so much trouble, as the river would be sure to freeze over

before many days. So the army was posted in detachments along the east bank,

with its centre at Trenton, under Colonel Rahl; and while they waited for that

"snap" of intensely cold weather, which in this climate seldom fails to come on

within a few days of Christmas, Howe and Cornwallis both went back to New

York.<p>



<p>



Meanwhile, on the 2d of December, Lee had at last crossed the Hudson with a

force diminished to 4000 men, and had proceeded by slow marches as far as

Morristown. Further reinforcements were at hand. General Schuyler, in command

of the army which had retreated the last summer from Canada, was guarding the

forts on Lake Champlain; and as these appeared to be safe for the present, he

detached seven regiments to go to the aid of Washington. As soon as Lee heard

of the arrival of three of these regiments at Peekskill, he ordered them to

join him at Morristown. As the other four, under General Gates, were making

their way through northern New Jersey, doubts arose as to where they should

find Washington in the course of his swift retreat. Gates sent his aid, Major

Wilkinson, forward for instructions, and he, learning that Washington had

withdrawn into Pennsylvania, reported to Lee at Morristown, as second in

command.<p>



<p>



Lee had left his army in charge of Sullivan, and had foolishly taken up his

quarters at an unguarded tavern about four miles from the town, and here

Wilkinson found him in bed on the morning of the 13th. After breakfast Lee

wrote a confidential letter to Gates, as to a kindred spirit from whom he might

expect to get sympathy. Terrible had been the consequences of the disaster at

Fort Washington. "There never was so damned a stroke," said the letter. "Entre

nous, a certain great man is most damnably deficient. He has thrown me into a

situation where I have my choice of difficulties. If I stay in this province I

risk myself and army, and if I do not stay the province is lost forever.....Our

counsels have been weak to the last degree. As to yourself, if you think you

can be in time to aid the general, I would have you by all means go. You will

at least save your army....Adieu, my dear friend. God bless you." Hardly had he

signed his name to this scandalous document when Wilkinson, who was standing at

the window, exclaimed that the British were upon them. Sure enough. A Tory in

the neighborhood, discerning the golden opportunity, had galloped eighteen

miles to the British lines, and returned with a party of thirty dragoons, who

surrounded the house and captured the vainglorious schemer before he had time

to collect his senses. Bareheaded and dressed only in a flannel gown and

slippers, he was mounted on Wilkinson's horse, which stood waiting at the door,

and was carried off, amid much mirth and exultation, to the British camp.

Crestfallen and bewildered, he expressed a craven hope that his life might be

spared, but was playfully reminded that he would very likely be summarily dealt

with as a deserter from the British army; and with this scant comfort he was

fain to content himself for some weeks to come.<p>



<p>



The capture of General Lee was reckoned by the people as one more in a list of

dire catastrophes which made the present season the darkest moment in the whole

course of the war. Had they known all that we know now, they would have seen

that the army was well rid of a worthless mischief-maker, while the history of

the war had gained a curiously picturesque episode. Apart from this incident

there was cause enough for the gloom which now overspread the whole country.

Washington had been forced to seek shelter behind the Delaware with a handful

of men whose terms of service were soon to expire, and another fortnight might

easily witness the utter dispersal of this poor little army. At Philadelphia,

where Putnam was now in command, there was a general panic, and people began

hiding their valuables and moving their wives and children out into the

country. Congress took fright, and retired to Baltimore. At the beginning of

December, Lord Howe and his brother had issued a proclamation offering pardon

and protection to all citizens who within sixty days should take the oath of

allegiance to the British Crown; and in the course of ten days nearly three

thousand persons, many of them wealthy and of high standing in society, had

availed themselves of this promise. The British soldiers and the Tories

considered the contest virtually ended. General Howe was compared with Caesar,

who came, and saw, and conquered. For his brilliant successes he had been made

a Knight Commander of the Bath, and New York was to become the scene of merry

Christmas festivities on the occasion of his receiving the famous red ribbon.

In his confidence that Washington's strength was quite exhausted, he detached a

considerable force from the army in New Jersey, and sent it, under Lord Percy,

to take possession of Newport as a convenient station for British ships

entering the Sound. Donop and Rahl with their Hessians and Grant with his hardy

Scotchmen would not quite suffice to destroy the remnant of Washington's army;

and Cornwallis accordingly packed his portmanteaus and sent them aboard ship,

intending to sail for England as soon as the fumes of the Christmas punch

should be duly slept off.<p>



<p>



Well might Thomas Paine declare, in the first of the series of pamphlets

entitled The Crisis, which he now began to publish, that "these are the times

that try men's souls." But in the midst of the general despondency there were a

few brave hearts that had not yet begun to despair, and the bravest of these

was Washington's. At this awful moment the whole future of America, and of all

that America signifies to the world, rested upon that single Titanic will.

Cruel defeat and yet more cruel treachery, enough to have crushed the

strongest, could not crush Washington. All the lion in him was aroused, and his

powerful nature was aglow with passionate resolve. His keen eye already saw the

elements of weakness in Howe's too careless disposition of his forces on the

east bank of the Delaware, and he had already planned for his antagonist such a

Christmas greeting as he little expected. Just at this moment Washington was

opportunely reinforced by Sullivan and Gates, with the troops lately under

Lee's command; and with his little army thus raised to 6000 men, he meditated

such a bold stroke as might revive the drooping spirits of his countrymen, and

confound the enemy in the very moment of his fancied triumph.<p>



<p>



Washington's plan was, by a sudden attack, to overwhelm the British centre at

Trenton, and thus force the army to retreat upon New York. The Delaware was to

be crossed in three divisions. The right wing, of 2000 men, under Gates was to

attack Count Donop at Burlington; Ewing, with the centre, was to cross directly

opposite Trenton; while Washington himself, with the left wing, was to cross

nine miles above, and march down upon Trenton from the north. On Christmas Day

all was ready, but the beginnings of the enterprise were not auspicious. Gates,

who preferred to go and intrigue in Congress, succeeded in begging off, and

started for Baltimore. Cadwalader, who took his place, tried hard to get his

men and artillery across the river, but was baffled by the huge masses of

floating ice, and reluctantly gave up the attempt. Ewing was so discouraged

that he did not even try to cross, and both officers took it for granted that

Washington must be foiled in like manner. But Washington was desperately in

earnest; and although at sunset, just as he had reached his crossing-place, he

was informed by special messenger of the failure of Ewing and Cadwalader, he

determined to go on and make the attack with the 2500 men whom he had with him.

The great blocks of ice, borne swiftly along by the powerful current, made the

passage extremely dangerous, but Glover, with his skillful fishermen of

Marblehead, succeeded in ferrying the little army across without the loss of a

man or a gun. More than ten hours were consumed in the passage, and then there

was a march of nine miles to be made in a blinding storm of snow and sleet.

They pushed rapidly on in two columns, led by Greene and Sullivan respectively,

drove in the enemy's pickets at the point of the bayonet, and entered the town

by different roads soon after sunrise. Washington's guns were at once planted

so as to sweep the streets, and after Colonel Rahl and seventeen of his men had

been slain, the whole body of Hessians, 1000 in number, surrendered at

discretion. Of the Americans, two were frozen to death on the march, and two

were killed in the action. By noon of the next day Cadwalader had crossed the

river to Burlington, but no sooner had Donop heard what had happened at Trenton

than he retreated by a circuitous road to Princeton, leaving behind all his

sick and wounded soldiers, and all his heavy arms and baggage. Washington

recrossed into Pennsylvania with his prisoners, but again advanced, and

occupied Trenton on the 29th.<p>



<p>



When the news of the catastrophe reached New York, the holiday feasting was

rudely disturbed. Instead of embarking for England, Cornwallis rode post-haste

to Princeton, where he found Donop throwing up earthworks. On the morning of

January 2d Cornwallis advanced, with 8000 men, upon Trenton, but his march was

slow and painful. He was exposed during most of the day to a galling fire from

parties of riflemen hidden in the woods by the roadside, and Greene, with a

force of 600 men and two field-pieces, contrived so to harass and delay him

that he did not reach Trenton till late in the afternoon. By that time

Washington had withdrawn his whole force beyond the Assunpink, a small river

which flows into the Delaware just south of Trenton, and had guarded the bridge

and the fords by batteries admirably placed. The British made several attempts

to cross, but were repulsed with some slaughter; and as their day's work had

sorely fatigued them, Cornwallis thought best to wait until to-morrow, while he

went his messenger post-haste back to Princeton to bring up a force of nearly

2000 men which he had left behind there. With this added strength he felt sure

that he could force the passage of the stream above the American position, when

by turning Washington's right flank he could fold him back against the

Delaware, and thus compel him to surrender. Cornwallis accordingly went to bed

in high spirits. "At last we have run down the old fox," said he, "and we will

bag him in the morning."<p>



<p>



<p>



This situation was indeed a very dangerous one; but when the British general

called his antagonist an old fox, he did him no more than justice. In its union

of slyness with audacity, the movement which Washington now executed strongly

reminds one of "Stonewall" Jackson. He understood perfectly well what

Cornwallis intended to do; but he knew at the same time that detachments of the

British army must have been left behind at Princeton and New Brunswick to guard

the stores. From the size of the army before him he rightly judged that these

rear detachments must be too small to withstand his own force. By overwhelming

one or both of them, he could compel Cornwallis to retreat upon New York, while

he himself might take up an impregnable position on the heights about

Morristown, from which he might threaten the British line and hold their whole

army in check,--a most brilliant and daring scheme for a commander to entertain

while in such a perilous position as Washington was that night! But the manner

in which he began by extricating himself was not the least brilliant part of

the manoeuvre. All night long the American camp-fires were kept burning

brightly, and small parties were busily engaged in throwing up intrenchments so

near the Assunpink that the British sentinels could plainly hear the murmur of

their voices and the thud of the spade and pickaxe. While this was going on,

the whole American army marched swiftly up the south bank of the little stream,

passed around Cornwallis's left wing to his rear, and gained the road to

Princeton. Toward sunrise, as the British detachment was coming down the road

from Princeton to Trenton, in obedience to Cornwallis's order, its van, under

Colonel Mawhood, met the foremost column of Americans approaching, under

General Mercer. As he caught sight of the Americans, Mawhood thought that they

must be a party of fugitives, and hastened to intercept them; but he was soon

undeceived. The Americans attacked with vigor, and a sharp fight was sustained,

with varying fortunes, until Mercer was pierced by a bayonet, and his men began

to fall back in some confusion. Just at this critical moment Washington came

galloping upon the field and rallied the troops, and as the entire forces on

both sides had now come up the fight became general. In a few minutes the

British were routed and their line was cut in two; one half fleeing toward

Trenton, the other half toward New Brunswick. There was little slaughter, as

the whole fight did not occupy more than twenty minutes. The British lost about

200 in killed and wounded, with 300 prisoners and their cannon; the American

loss was less than 100.<p>



<p>



Shortly before sunrise, the men who had been left in the camp on the Assunpink

to feed the fires and make a noise beat a hasty retreat, and found their way to

Princeton by circuitous paths. When Cornwallis got up, he could hardly believe

his eyes. Here was nothing before him but an empty camp: the American army had

vanished, and whither it had gone he could not imagine. But his perplexity was

soon relieved by the booming of distant cannon on the Princeton road, and the

game which the "old fox" had played him all at once became apparent. Nothing

was to be done but to retreat upon New Brunswick with all possible haste, and

save the stores there. His road led back through Princeton, and from fugitives

he soon heard the story of the morning's disaster. His march was hindered by

various impediments. A thaw had set in, so that the little streams had swelled

into roaring torrents, difficult to ford, and the American army, which had

passed over the road before daybreak, had not forgotten to destroy the bridges.

By the time that Cornwallis and his men reached Princeton, wet and weary, the

Americans had already left it, but they had not gone on to New Brunswick.

Washington had hoped to seize the stores there, but the distance was eighteen

miles, his men were wretchedly shod and too tired to march rapidly, and it

would not be prudent to risk a general engagement when his main purpose could

be secured without one. For these reasons, Washington turned northward to the

heights of Morristown, while Cornwallis continued his retreat to New Brunswick.

A few days later, Putnam advanced from Philadelphia and occupied Princeton,

thus forming the right wing of the American army, of which the main body lay at

Morristown, while Heath's division on the Hudson constituted the left wing.

Various cantonments were established along this long line. On the 5th, George

Clinton, coming down from Peekskill, drove the British out of Hackensack and

occupied it, while on the same day a detachment of German mercenaries at

Springfield was routed by a body of militia. Elizabethtown was then taken by

General Maxwell, whereupon the British retired from Newark.<p>



<p>



Thus in a brief campaign of three weeks Washington had rallied the fragments of

a defeated and broken army, fought two successful battles, taken nearly 2000

prisoners, and recovered the State of New Jersey. He had canceled the

disastrous effects of Lee's treachery, and replaced things apparently in the

condition in which the fall of Fort Washington had left them. Really he had

done much more than this, for by assuming the offensive and winning victories

through sheer force of genius, he had completely turned the tide of popular

feeling. The British generals began to be afraid of him, while on the other

hand his army began to grow by the accession of fresh recruits. In New Jersey

the enemy retained nothing but New Brunswick, Amboy, and Paulus Hook.<p>



<p>



On the 25th Washington issued a proclamation declaring that all persons who had

accepted Lord Howe's offer of protection must either retire within the British

lines, or come forward and take the oath of allegiance to the United States.

Many narrow-minded people, who did not look with favor upon a close federation

of the States, commented severely upon the form of this proclamation: it was

too national, they said. But it proved effective. However luke-warm may have

been the interest which many of the Jersey people felt in the war when their

soil was first invaded, the conduct of the British troops had been such that

every one now looked upon them as foreign enemies. They had not only foraged

indiscriminately upon friend and foe, but they had set fire to farmhouses,

murdered peaceful citizens, and violated women. The wrath of the people,

kindled by such outrages, had waxed so hot that it was not safe for the British

to stir beyond their narrow lines except in considerable force. Their foraging

parties were waylaid and cut off by bands of indignant yeomanry, and so sorely

were they harassed in their advanced position at New Brunswick that they often

suffered from want of food. Many of the German mercenaries, caring nothing for

the cause in which they had been forcibly enlisted, began deserting; and in

this they were encouraged by Congress, which issued a manifesto in German,

making a liberal offer of land to any foreign soldier who should leave the

British service. This little document was inclosed in the wrappers in which

packages of tobacco were sold, and every now and then some canny smoker

accepted the offer.<p>



<p>



Washington's position at Morristown was so strong that there was no hope of

dislodging him, and the snow-blocked roads made the difficulties of a winter

campaign so great that Howe thought best to wait for warm weather before doing

anything more. While the British arms were thus held in check, the friends of

America, both in England and on the continent of Europe, were greatly

encouraged. From this moment Washington was regarded in Europe as a first-rate

general. Military critics who were capable of understanding his movements

compared his brilliant achievements with his slender resources, and discovered

in him genius of a high order. Men began to call him "the American Fabius;" and

this epithet was so pleasing to his fellow-countrymen, that it clung to him for

the rest of his life, and was repeated in newspapers and speeches and pamphlets

with wearisome iteration. Yet there was something more than Fabian in

Washington's generalship. For wariness he has never been surpassed; yet, as

Colonel Stedman observed in his excellent contemporary history of the war, the

most remarkable thing about Washington was his courage. It would be hard indeed

to find more striking examples of audacity than he exhibited at Trenton and

Princeton. Lord Cornwallis was no mean antagonist, and no one was a better

judge of what a commander might be expected to do with a given stock of

resources. His surprise at the Assunpink was so great that he never got over

it. After the surrender at Yorktown, his lordship expressed to Washington his

generous admiration for the wonderful skill which had suddenly hurled an army

four hundred miles, from the Hudson River to the James, with such precision and

such deadly effect. "But after all," he added, "your Excellency's achievements

in New Jersey were such that nothing could surpass them. The man who had turned

the tables on him at the Assunpink he could well believe to be capable of

anything. <p>



<p>



In England the effect of the campaign was very serious. Not long before, Edmund

Burke had despondingly remarked that an army which was always obliged to refuse

battle could never expel the invaders; but now the case wore a different

aspect. Sir William Howe had not so much to show for his red ribbon, after all.

He had taken New York, and dealt many heavy blows with his overwhelming force

unexpectedly aided by foul play on the American side; but as for crushing

Washington and ending the war, he seemed farther from it than ever. It would

take another campaign to do this,--perhaps many. Lord North, who had little

heart for the war at any time, was discouraged, while the king and Lord George

Germaine were furious with disappointment. "It was that unhappy affair of

Trenton," observed the latter, "that blasted our hopes."

</center>

<br>
<blockquote>

<font size=6><b>Y</b></font>UCATECANS LIVE in a tasty world of
bright flavors. The natural
sweetness of ripe tomatoes invigorated with the ignitable potential of
habanero, the aroma of cilantro, the zing of sour orange or lime, and the
resonant crunch of raw radish and onion. That's <i>xnipec</i> (say "shnee-pek,"
Mayan for "nose of the dog" the books say, refraining from further comment). If
you leave out the tomatoes, most Yucatecans call the resulting mix
<i>salpic&oacute;n,</i> an enlivened sprinkle for their otherwise quite simply
flavored fare. I doubt you'd think of the tomatoless version as a salsa
(especially one for chips), but its possibilities as a relish are numerous.
Either version is essential in my kitchen to accompany anything flavored with
achiote.<p>

<br>


<font size=2><b><center>MAKES ABOUT 2 CUPS</font></b></center>

<br>

<b>
<i><UL>
<LI>1 small (4-ounce) red onion

<LI>2 tablespoons fresh sour orange or lime juice

<LI>10 ounces (2 small round or 3 or 4 plum) ripe tomatoes

<LI>6 radishes

<LI>1/2 to 1 whole fresh habanero chile, depending
      on your personal attraction to the "burn"

<LI>A dozen or so large sprigs of cilantro

<LI>Salt, about 1/2 teaspoon
</i></UL>
</b>
<br>

Very finely chop the onion with a knife (a food processor will make it
into a quickly souring mess), scoop it into a strainer and rinse under cold
water. Shake off as much water as possible, then transfer to a small bowl and
stir in the juice to "deflame" the onion's pungency. Set aside while you
prepare the remaining ingredients.<p>

     Core the tomatoes, then cut them crosswise in half and squeeze out the
seeds if you want (it'll make the sauce seem less rustic). Finely dice the
tomatoes by slicing them into roughly 1/4-inch pieces, then cutting each slice
into small dice. Scoop into a bowl. Slice the radishes 1/16 inch thick, then
chop into matchsticks or small dice. Add to the tomatoes. Carefully cut out and
discard the habanero's seed pod (wear rubber gloves if your hands are sensitive
to the piquancy of the chiles), mince the flesh into tiny bits, and add to the
tomatoes. Bunch up the cilantro sprigs, and, with a very sharp knife, slice
them 1/16 inch thick, stems and all, working from the leafy end toward the
stems.<p>

     Combine radishes, chile, and chopped cilantro with the tomato mixture, stir
in the onion and juice mixture, taste and season with salt, and it's ready to
serve in a salsa dish for spooning onto tacos, grilled fish, and the like.<p>

<br>

<b><font size=2>ADVANCE PREPARATION</font> -- </b>The salsa is best within
a few hours of its
completion, and be forewarned that the longer it sits, the more <i>picante</i>
it will seem.<p>

<p>

<b><font size=2>OTHER CHILES YOU CAN USE</font> -- </b>Jalape&ntilde;os and
serranos (3 to 5) can
replace the habanero. Manzano chiles (1/2 to 1) also would taste good in this
salsa.<p>

<p>
<br>
<center><b><font size=4>S</font><font size=2>IMPLE </font><font
size=4>I</font><font size=2>DEAS FROM</font> <font
size=4>M</font><font size=2>Y</font> <font size=4>A</font><font size=2>MERICAN
</font><font size=4>H</font><font size=2>OME</b></font></center>

<br>

<b><i>Spicy Chicken Salad -- </i></b>Mix cubed cooked chicken (try smoked
chicken for even more flavor) with  mayonnaise until you get the chicken salad
as moist as you like it. Stir in salsa a spoonful at a time (draining off as
much liquid as possible) until the salad is spicy and nicely flavored. Diced
j&iacute;cama adds a nice crunch; a little more cilantro adds liveliness.<p>

<br>

<b><i>Seafood or Asparagus Salad -- </i></b>As a substantial appetizer for
four, very briefly boil 1 pound of shrimp or steam 1 pound of asparagus until
tender; cool. Mix 2 to 4 tablespoons of olive oil with 2 tablespoons sour
orange or lime juice, stir in a cup or so of the salsa and taste for salt (it
should be a little salty). For seafood: Combine salsa and cooked seafood, and
let stand an hour or so, stirring regularly, before serving on a bed of sliced
lettuce. For asparagus: Divide the asparagus among 4 lettuce-lined plates and
spoon the salsa mixture over them. You may want a little extra chopped
cilantro.<p>

<br>

<b><i>Seared Fish with Tangy Habanero -- </i></b> In a large, heavy skillet
filmed with oil, sear 4 fish fillets over medium-high heat until brown on both
sides. Remove from the pan, add the salsa and stir until wilted and the liquid
reduces. Stir in 1/4 to 1/3 cup of heavy cream or <i>cr&egrave;me
fraiche</i>, then nestle the fish back in the pan. Cover and simmer over
medium-low heat until the fish barely flakes. Transfer to dinner plates. If the
sauce is thinner than you'd like, boil it briskly to reduce, then spoon over
the fillets.<p>

Mr. Villard came to the United States from Germany in 1853, and	as soon as he had mastered the English language began newspaper work,	contributing to various New York and Western journals. He first met Mr. Lincoln	while reporting the Lincoln-Douglas debate for the New York Staats-Zeituung, as	stated below. From that time on it was his good fortune to see a great deal of	Mr. Lincoln, and to accompany him to New York on his journey to Washington for	his inauguration, and to win Mr. Lincoln's confidence. He was in turn able to	be of service to Mr. Lincoln in various ways, as, for instance, in bringing to	the President the first authentic account of the condition of the Army of the	Potomac after the battle of Fredericksburg.<p>		<p>		                                                                         --THE	EDITORS]<p></i></font><p>		<p>		<p><br><p><br>		<font size=5>T</font><font size=3>he first joint debate between Douglas and Lincoln which I attended (the second	in the series of seven) took place on the afternoon of August 27, 1858, at	Freeport, Illinois. It was the great event of the day, and attracted an immense	concourse of people from all parts of the state. Douglas spoke first for an	hour, followed by Lincoln for an hour and a half; upon which the former closed	in another half hour. The Democratic spokesman commanded a strong, sonorous	voice, a rapid, vigorous utterance, a telling play of countenance, impressive	gestures, and all the other arts of the practiced speaker. As far as all	external conditions were concerned, there was nothing in favor of Lincoln. He	had a lean, lank, indescribably gawky figure, an odd-featured, wrinkled,	inexpressive, and altogether uncomely face. He used singularly awkward, almost	absurd up-and-down and sidewise movements of his body to give emphasis to his	arguments. His voice was naturally good, but he frequently raised it to an	unnatural pitch. Yet the unprejudiced mind felt at once that, while there was	on the one side a skillful dialectician and debater arguing a wrong and weak	cause, there was on the other a thoroughly earnest and truthful man, inspired	by sound convictions in consonance with the true spirit of American	institutions. There was nothing in all Douglas's powerful effort that appealed	to the higher instincts of human nature, while Lincoln always touched	sympathetic chords. Lincoln's speech excited and sustained the enthusiasm of	his audience to the end. When he had finished, two stalwart young farmers	rushed on the platform, and, in spite of his remonstrances, seized and put him	on their shoulders and carried him in that uncomfortable posture for a	considerable distance. It was really a ludicrous sight to see the grotesque	figure holding frantically to the heads of his supporters, with his legs	dangling from their shoulders, and his pantaloons pulled up so as to expose his	underwear almost to his knees. Douglas made dexterous use of this incident in	his next speech, expressing sincere regret that, against his wish, he had used	up his old friend Lincoln so completely that he had to be carried off the	stage. Lincoln retaliated by saying at the first opportunity that he had known	Judge Douglas long and well, but there was nevertheless one thing he could not	say of him, and that was that the Judge always told the truth.<p>		<p>		<p>		I was introduced to Lincoln at Freeport, and met him frequently afterwards in	the course of the campaign. I must say frankly that, although I found him most	approachable, good-natured, and full of wit and humor, I could not take a real	personal liking to the man, owing to an inborn weakness for which he was even	then notorious and so remained during his great public career. He was	inordinately fond of jokes, anecdotes, and stories. He loved to hear them, and	still more to tell them himself out of the inexhaustible supply provided by his	good memory and his fertile fancy. There would have been no harm in this but	for the fact that, the coarser the joke, the lower the anecdote, and the more	risky the story, the more he enjoyed them, especially when they were of his own	invention. He possessed, moreover, a singular ingenuity in bringing about	occasions in conversation for indulgences of this kind. I have to confess, too,	that aside from the prejudice against him which I felt on this account, I	shared the belief of a good many independent thinkers at the time, including	prominent leaders of the Republican party, that, with regard to separating more	effectively the anti-slavery Northern from the pro-slavery Southern wing of the	Democracy, it would have been better if the reelection of Douglas had not been	opposed.<p>		<p>		<p>		The party warfare was hotly continued in all parts of the state from early	summer till election day in November. Besides the seven joint debates, both	Douglas and Lincoln spoke scores of times separately, and numerous other	speakers from Illinois and other states contributed incessantly to the	agitation. The two leaders visited almost every county in the state. I heard	four of the joint debates, and six other speeches by Lincoln and eight by his	competitor. Of course, the later efforts became substantial repetitions of the	preceding ones, and to listen to them grew more and more tiresome to me. As I	had seen something of political campaigns before, this one did not exercise the	full charm of novelty upon me. Still, even if I had been a far more callous	observer, I could not have helped being struck with the efficient party	organizations, the skillful tactics of the managers, the remarkable feats of	popular oratory, and the earnestness and enthusiasm of the audiences I	witnessed. It was a most instructive object-lesson in practical party politics,	and filled me with admiration for the Anglo-American method of working out	popular destiny.<p>		<p>		<p>		In other respects, my experiences were not altogether agreeable. It was a very	hot summer, and I was obliged to travel almost continuously. Illinois had then	only about a million and a half of inhabitants, poorly constructed railroads,	and bad country roads, over which latter I had to journey quite as much as over	the former. The taverns in town and country, as a rule, were wretched; and, as	I moved about with the candidates and their followers and encountered crowds	everywhere, I fared miserably in many places. Especially in the southern part	of the state, then known as "Egypt" and mostly inhabited by settlers from the	Southern states, food and lodging were nearly always simply abominable. I still	vividly remember the day of semi-starvation, and the night with half-a-dozen	room-mates, I passed at Jonesboro', where the third joint debate took place.<p>		<p>		<p>		I saw more of Illinois than I have since seen of any other state in the Union,	and I acquired a thorough faith, based on the immeasurable fertility of her	prairies, in the great growth that she has since attained. I also formed many	valuable acquaintances, a number of which have continued to this day. It was	then that I first saw my lifelong friend Horace White, who accompanied Mr.	Lincoln as the representative of the Chicago Tribune, and R. R. Hitt, the	official stenographer of the Republican candidate. He was one of the most	skilled shorthand writers in the country, and his success as such led in due	time to his appointment as reporter of the United States Supreme Court. This	position he resigned for a successful career as diplomat and Congressman.<p>		<p>		<p>		I firmly believe that, if Stephen A. Douglas had lived, he would have had a	brilliant national career. Freed by the Southern rebellion from all	identification with pro-slavery interests, the road would have been open to the	highest fame and position for which his unusual talents qualified him. As I	took final leave of him and Lincoln, doubtless neither of them had any idea	that within two years they would be rivals again in the Presidential race. I	had it from Lincoln's own lips that the United States Senatorship was the	greatest political height he at the time expected to climb. He was full of	doubt, too, of his ability to secure the majority of the Legislature against	Douglas. These confidences he imparted to me on a special occasion which I must	not omit to mention in detail before leaving this subject.<p>		<p>		<p>		He and I met accidentally, about nine o'clock on a hot, sultry evening, at a	flag railroad station about twenty miles west of Springfield, on my return from	a great meeting at Petersburg in Menard County. He had been driven to the	station in a buggy and left there alone. I was already there. The train that we	intended to take for Springfield was about due. After vainly waiting for half	an hour for its arrival, a thunderstorm compelled us to take refuge in an empty	freight car standing on a side track, there being no buildings of any sort at	the station. We squatted down on the floor of the car and fell to talking on	all sorts of subjects. It was then and there he told me that, when he was	clerking in a country store, his highest political ambition was to be a member	of the state Legislature. "Since then, of course," he said laughingly, "I have	grown some, but my friends got me into THIS business [meaning the canvass]. I	did not consider myself qualified for the United States Senate, and it took me	a long time to persuade myself that I was. Now, to be sure," he continued, with	another of his peculiar laughs, "I am convinced that I am good enough for it;	but, in spite of it all, I am saying to myself every day: 'It is too big a	thing for you; you will never get it.' Mary [his wife] insists, however, that I	am going to be Senator and President of the United States, too." These last	words he followed with a roar of laughter, with his arms around his knees, and	shaking all over with mirth at his wife's ambition. "Just think," he exclaimed,	"of such a sucker as me as President!"<p>		<p>		<p>		He then fell to asking questions regarding my antecedents, and expressed some	surprise at my fluent use of English after so short a residence in the United	States. Next he wanted to know whether it was true that most of the educated	people in Germany were "infidels." I answered that they were not openly	professed infidels, but such a conclusion might be drawn from the fact that	most of them were not church-goers. "I do not wonder at that," he rejoined; "my	own inclination is that way." I ventured to give expression to my own disbelief	in the doctrine of the Christian Church relative to the existence of God, the	divinity of Christ, and immortality. This led him to put other questions to me	to draw me out. He did not commit himself, but I received the impression that	he was of my own way of thinking. It was no surprise to me, therefore, to find	in the writings of his biographers Ward Hill Lamon and W. H. Herndon that I had	correctly understood him. Our talk continued till half-past ten, when the	belated train arrived. I cherish this accidental rencontre as one of my most	precious recollections, since my companion of that night has become one of the	greatest figures in history.<p>		<p>		<p>		I went from Jonesboro' to Chicago, and remained there till after the election.	I considered the outcome so uncertain that I did not venture any predictions in	my correspondence. Douglas himself, I knew, was much in doubt; Lincoln and his	friends were very confident, and therefore bitterly disappointed by the	result.<p>		<p>		<p>		<font size=4><b>LINCOLN AND THE BUFFALO ROBE</font></b><p>		<p>		[In 1859 Mr. Villard went as correspondent of the Cincinnati Commercial to	Colorado to report upon the newly discovered gold regions. On his return	journey over the plains, which was made in a two-horse wagon, there occurred	the meeting described by him as follows:--]<p>		<p>		<p>		About thirty miles from St. Joseph an extraordinary incident occurred. A buggy	with two occupants was coming toward us over the open prairie. As it	approached, I thought I recognized one of them, and, sure enough, it turned out	to be no less a person than Abraham Lincoln! I stopped the wagon, called him by	name, and jumped off to shake hands. He did not recognize me with my full beard	and pioneer's costume. When I said, "Don't you know me?" and gave my name, he	looked at me, most amazed, and then burst out laughing. "Why, good gracious!	you look like a real Pike's Peaker." His surprise at this unexpected meeting	was as great as mine. He was on a lecturing tour through Kansas. It was a cold	morning, and the wind blew cuttingly from the northwest. He was shivering in	the open buggy, without even a roof over it, in a short overcoat, and without	any covering for his legs. I offered him one of my buffalo robes, which he	gratefully accepted. He undertook, of course, to return it to me, but I never	saw it again. After ten minutes' chat, we separated. The next time I saw him he	was the Republican candidate for the Presidency.<p>		<p>		<p>		<font size=4><b>SPRINGFIELD</font></b><p>		<p>		[In the last days of November, 1860, the Associated Press sent Mr. Villard to	Springfield, Illinois, to report current events at that place by telegraph,	until the departure of Mr. Lincoln for Washington. This duty brought Mr.	Villard into daily relations with the President-elect, who gave him a most	friendly welcome and bade him ask for information at any time he wished it.]<p>		<p>		<p>		Mr. Lincoln soon found, after his election, that his modest two-story frame	dwelling was altogether inadequate for the throng of local callers and of	visitors from a distance, and, accordingly, he gladly availed himself of the	offer of the use of the governor's room in the Capitol building. On my arrival,	he had already commenced spending a good part of each day in it. He appeared	daily, except Sundays, between nine and ten o'clock, and held a reception till	noon, to which all comers were admitted, without even the formality of first	sending in cards. Whoever chose to call received the same hearty greeting. At	noon, he went home to dinner and reappeared at about two. Then his	correspondence was given proper attention, and visitors of distinction were	seen by special appointment at either the State House or the hotel.	Occasionally, but very rarely, he passed some time in his law office. In the	evening, old friends called at his home for the exchange of news and political	views. At times, when important news was expected, he would go to the telegraph	or newspaper offices after supper, and stay there till late. Altogether,	probably no other president-elect was so approachable to everybody, at least	during the first weeks of my stay. But he found in the end, as was to be	expected, that this popular practice involved a good deal of fatigue, and that	he needed more time for himself; and the hours he gave up to the public were	gradually restricted.<p>		<p>		<p>		I was present almost daily for more or less time during his morning reception.	I generally remained a silent listener, as I could get at him at other hours	when I was in need of information. It was a most interesting study to watch the	manner of his intercourse with callers. As a rule, he showed remarkable tact in	dealing with each of them, whether they were rough-looking Sangamon County	farmers still addressing him familiarly as "Abe," sleek and pert commercial	travelers, staid merchants, sharp politicians, or preachers, lawyers, or other	professional men. He showed a very quick and shrewd perception of and	adaptation to individual characteristics and peculiarities. He never evaded a	proper question, or failed to give a fit answer. He was ever ready for an	argument, which always had an original flavor, and, as a rule, he got the	better in the discussion. There was, however, one limitation to the freedom of	his talks with his visitors. A great many of them naturally tried to draw him	out as to his future policy as President regarding the secession movement in	the South, but he would not commit himself. The most remarkable and attractive	feature of those daily "levees," however, was his constant indulgence of his	story-telling propensity. Of course, all the visitors had heard of it and were	eager for the privilege of listening to a practical illustration of his	preeminence in that line. He knew this, and took special delight in meeting	their wishes. he never was at a loss for a story or an anecdote to explain a	meaning or enforce a point, the aptness of which was always perfect. His supply	was apparently inexhaustible, and the stories sounded so real that it was hard	to determine whether he repeated what he had heard from others, or had invented	himself.<p>		<p>		<p>		None of his hearers enjoyed the wit--and wit was an unfailing ingredient--of	his stories half as much as he did himself. It was a joy indeed to see the	effect upon him. A high-pitched laughter lighted up his otherwise melancholy	countenance with thorough merriment. His body shook all over with gleeful	emotion, and when he felt particularly good over his performance, he followed	his habit of drawing his knees, with his arms around them, up to his very face,	as I had seen him do in 1858. I am sorry to state that he often allowed himself	altogether too much license in the concoction of the stories. he seemed to be	bent upon making his hit by fair means or foul. In other word, he never	hesitated to tell a coarse or even outright nasty story, if it served his	purpose. All his personal friends could bear testimony on this point. It was a	notorious fact that this fondness for low talk clung to him even in the White	House. More than once I heard him "with malice aforethought" get off purposely	some repulsive fiction in order to rid himself of an uncomfortable caller.	Again and again I felt disgust and humiliation that such a person should have	been called upon to direct the destinies of a great nation in the direst period	of its history. Yet his achievements during the next few years proved him to be	one of the great leaders of mankind in adversity, in whom low leanings only set	off more strikingly his better qualities. At the time of which I speak, I could	not have persuaded myself that the man might possibly possess true greatness of	mind and nobility of heart. I do not wish to convey the idea, however, that he	was mainly given to trivialities and vulgarities in his conversation; for, in	spite of his frequent outbreaks of low humor, his was really a very sober and	serious nature, and even inclined to gloominess to such an extent that all his	biographers have attributed a strongly melancholic disposition to him.<p>		<p>		<p>		I often availed myself of his authorization to come to him at any time for	information. There were two questions in which the public, of course, felt the	deepest interest, and upon which I was expected to supply light, namely, the	composition of his Cabinet, and his views upon the secession movement that was	daily growing in extent and strength. As to the former, he gave me to	understand early, by indirection, that, as everybody expected, William H.	Seward and S.P. Chase, his competitors for the presidential nomination, would	be among his constitutional advisers. It was hardly possible for him not to	recognize them, and he steadily turned a deaf ear to the remonstrances that	were made against them as "extreme men" by leading politicians from the Border	States, particularly from Kentucky and Missouri. As to the remaining members of	his Cabinet, they were definitely selected much later, and after a protracted	and wearisome tussle with the delegations of various states that came to	Springfield to urge the claims of their "favorite sons." I shall refer again to	this subject.<p>		<p>		<p>		No one who heard him talk upon the other question could fail to discover his	"other side," and to be impressed with his deep earnestness, his anxious	contemplation of public affairs, and his thorough sense of the extraordinary	responsibilities that were coming upon him. He never refused to talk with me	about secession, but generally evaded answers to specific interrogatories, and	confined himself to generalization. I was present at a number of conversations	which he had with leading public men upon the same subject, when he showed the	same reserve. He did not hesitate to say that the Union ought to, and in his	opinion would, be preserved, and to go into long arguments in support of the	proposition, based upon the history of the republic, the homogeneity of the	population, the natural features of the country, such as the common coast, the	rivers and mountains, that compelled political and commercial unity. But he	could not be got to say what he would do in the face of Southern secession,	except that as President he should be sworn to maintain the Constitution of the	United States, and that he was therefore bound to fulfill that duty. He met in	the same general way the frequent questions whether he should consider it his	duty to resort to coercion by force of arms against the states engaged in	attempts to secede. In connection therewith I understood him, however, several	times to express doubts as to the practicability of holding the slave states in	the Union by main force, if they were all determined to break it up. He was	often embarrassed by efforts of radical anti-slavery men to get something out	of him in encouragement of their hopes that the crisis would result in the	abolition of slavery. He did not respond as they wished, and made it clear that	he did not desire to be considered an "abolitionist," and that he still held	the opinion that property in slaves was entitled to protection under the	Constitution, and that its owners could not be deprived of it without due	compensation. Consciously or unconsciously, he, like everybody else, must have	been influenced in his views by current events. As political passion in the	South rose higher and higher, and actual defiance of Federal authority by deeds	of violence occurred almost daily after his election, culminating in the formal	secession of seven states and the establishment of the Southern Confederacy	under Jefferson Davis at Montgomery, Alabama, the belief, which he doubtless	had originally, that by a conciliatory course as President he could pacify the	rebellious states, must have become shaken. Still, I think I interpret his	views up to the time of his departure for Washington correctly in saying that	he had not lost faith in the preservation of peace between the North and the	South, and he certainly did not dream that his principal duty would be to raise	great armies and fleets, and the means to maintain them, for the suppression of	the most determined and sanguinary rebellion, in defense of slavery, that our	planet ever witnessed.<p>		<p>		<p>		The Jacksonian "doctrine" that "to the victors belong the spoils" was still so	universally the creed of all politicians, that it was taken for granted there	would be a change not only in all the principal, but also in all the minor,	Federal offices. It was also expected that the other time-honored party	practice of a division of executive patronage among the several states would be	carried out. Accordingly there appeared deputations from all the Northern and	Border States at Springfield to put in their respective claims for recognition.	Some of them came not only once, but several times. From a number of states	several delegations turned up, representing rival factions in the Republican	ranks, each pretending to be the rightful claimant. Almost every state	presented candidates for the Cabinet and for the principal diplomatic and	departmental offices. The hotel was the principal haunt of the place-hunters.	The tricks, the intrigues, and the manoeuvres that were practiced by them in	pursuit of their aims came nearly all within the range of my observation, as it	was my duty to furnish the earliest possible news of their success or failure.	As a rule, the various sets of spoilsmen were very willing to take me into	their confidence, but it was not always easy to distinguish what was true in	their communications from what they wished me to say to the press purely in	furtherance of their interests. Among the political visitors the most prominent	I met were: Simon Cameron, S.P. Chase, Thurlow Weed, Lyman Trumbull, N.B. Judd,	Richard J. Oglesby, Francis P. Blair, Sr. and Jr., B. Gratz Brown, William	Dennison, D.C. Carter of Ohio, Henry J. Winter, and Oliver P. Morton. Thurlow	Weed was by far the most interesting figure and the most astute operator among	them all.<p>		<p>		<p>		From what I have said, it will be understood that the President-elect had a	hard time of it with the office-seekers. But as he himself was a thorough	believer in the doctrine of rotation in office, he felt it his duty to submit	to this tribulation. The Cabinet appointments, other than those already named,	were especially troublesome to him. There was an intense struggle between	Indiana and Illinois, most embarrassing inasmuch as there were several	candidates from his own state, all intimate personal friends. Then came the	bitter contest between the Border States of Kentucky, Missouri, and Maryland,	and the Pennsylvania cabals pro and contra Simon Cameron. Amidst all his	perplexities, Lincoln displayed a good deal of patience and shrewdness in	dealing with these personal problems. His never-failing stories helped many	times to heal wounded feelings and mitigate disappointments. But he gradually	showed the wear and tear of these continuous visitations, and finally looked so	careworn as to excite one's compassion.<p>		<p>		<p>		<font size=4><b>THE JOURNEY TO WASHINGTON</font></b><p>		<p>		During the month of January, 1861, there appeared in Springfield one W. S.	Wood, a former hotel manager and organizer of pleasure excursions, I believe,	from the interior of New York state, who, on the recommendation of Thurlow	Weed, was to take charge of all the arrangements for the journey of the	President-elect to Washington. He was a man of comely appearance, greatly	impressed with the importance of his mission, and inclined to assume airs of	consequence and condescension. As he showed a disposition to ignore me, I made	a direct appeal to Mr. Lincoln, who instructed him that I was to be one of the	presidential party. In fact, I was the only member of the press forming part of	it as far as Cincinnati, although Messrs. Nicolay and Hay, for some unexplained	reason, fail to mention me in naming the members of the party.<p>		<p>		<p>		The start on the memorable journey was made shortly after eight o'clock on the	morning of Monday, February 11. It was a clear, crisp winter day. Only about	one hundred people, mostly personal friends, were assembled at the station to	shake hands for the last time with their distinguished townsman. It was not	strange that he yielded to the sad feelings which must have moved him at the	thought of what lay behind and what was before him, and gave them utterance in	a pathetic formal farewell to the gathering crowd, as follows:--<p>		<p>		"My Friends,--No one not in my position can appreciate the sadness I feel at	this parting. To this people I owe all that I am. Here I have lived more than a	quarter of a century; here my children were born, and here one of them lies	buried. I know not how soon I shall see you again. A duty devolves upon me	which is, perhaps, greater than that which has devolved upon any other man	since the days of Washington. He never would have succeeded except for the aid	of Divine Providence, upon which he at all times relied. I feel that I cannot	succeed without the same Divine aid which sustained him, and in the same	Almighty Being I place my reliance for support; and I hope you, my friends,	will all pray that I may receive that Divine assistance, without which I cannot	succeed, but with which success is certain. Again I bid you all an affectionate	farewell."<p>		<p>		<p>		I reproduce this here, as but for me it would not have been preserved in the	exact form in which it was delivered. It was entirely extemporized, and,	knowing this, I prevailed on Mr. Lincoln, immediately after starting, to write	it out for me on a "pad." I sent it over the wires from the first telegraph	station. I kept the pencil manuscript for some time, but, unfortunately, lost	it in my wanderings in the course of the civil war.<p>		<p>		<p>		Our traveling companions at the start were (besides Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln and	their three sons) W.S. Wood; J.G. Nicolay and John Hay; two old personal	friends of Mr. Lincoln, Judge David Davis of Bloomington, afterwards Associate	Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and N.B. Judd of Chicago, who had	the promise of the Secretaryship of the Interior; Dr. W. S. Wallace, a	brother-in-law; Lockwood Todd, a relative of Mrs. Lincoln, who was employed on	several important political missions during the next few months; and Ward Hill	Lamon, a lawyer of Bloomington, who afterwards became United States Marshal for	the District of Columbia, and as such a sort of major-domo at the White House,	and finally the author of a biography of Abraham Lincoln. For describing him in	this as an infidel Lamon was much and unjustly attacked. He brought a banjo	along, and amused us with negro songs. There was also a military escort,	consisting of Colonel Edwin Vose Sumner, the white-haired commander of a	cavalry regiment of the regular army, and of Major David Hunter, Captain John	Pope, and Captain Hazard of the same service. Colonel Sumner, Major Hunter, and	Captain Pope became well-known commanding generals during the war. Another	"military" character, a sort of pet of Mr. Lincoln, was Colonel E. E.	Ellsworth, who, though a mere youth, of small but broad figure, curly black	head, and handsome features, had achieved considerable local notoriety as a	captain of a crack "Zouave" militia company in Chicago. He was one of the first	victims of the civil war, being shot by a rebel while raising the United States	flag at Alexandria Virginia.<p>		<p>		<p>		The party had a special train, composed at first only of an ordinary passenger	car,--there were no parlor or drawing-room or sleeping cars in those days,--a	baggage-car, and engine. The first day's journey took us from the capital of	Illinois to that of Indiana. Until we reached the boundary of the latter state,	the demonstrations along the route were insignificant, except at Decatur, where	a great crowd, headed by Richard J. Oglesby, then a hotel-keeper, but	subsequently a general in the war, Governor, and United States Senator, greeted	the future Chief Magistrate, who delivered another farewell speech. At the	boundary, the train was boarded by a large delegation of leading Indianians,	including Schuyler Colfax, Henry S. Lane, Caleb B. Smith, and Thomas H. Nelson.	At Lafayette, a great crowd awaited our coming, and the President-elect had to	appear and speak to them. At Indianapolis, where the first day's journey ended,	he was formally welcomed by Governor Oliver P. Morton, and replied to him at	length. His speech was remarkable for the first public intimation that he	should consider it his duty as President to retake the properties of the United	States, including the forts unlawfully seized by the rebellious states, and	otherwise reestablish the authority of the Federal Government.<p>		<p>		<p>		The next stage of the journey was from Indianapolis to Cincinnati; the third,	from Cincinnati to Columbus; the fourth, from Columbus to Pittsburgh; the	fifth, from Pittsburgh to Cleveland; the sixth, from Cleveland to Buffalo,	where a rest was taken over Sunday. The eighth day the journey was continued as	far as Albany, and on the following day we reached New York. Everywhere there	were formal welcomes by the state or municipal authorities and by great crowds	of people, with brass bands, and public and private receptions. In different	localities pleasant variations were offered in the way of serenades, torchlight	processions, and gala theatrical performances. Altogether, the President had	every reason to feel flattered and encouraged by the demonstrations in his	honor. But the journey was a very great strain upon his physical and mental	strength, and he was well-nigh worn out when he reached Buffalo. He must have	spoken at least fifty times during the week. In the kindness of his heart--not	from any love of adulation, for he really felt very awkward about it--he never	refused to respond to a call for his appearance wherever the train stopped.	While he thus satisfied the public curiosity, he disappointed, by his	appearance, most of those who saw him for the first time. I could see that	impression clearly written on the faces of his rustic audiences. Nor was this	surprising, for they certainly saw the most unprepossessing features, the	gawkiest figure, and the most awkward manners. Lincoln always had an	embarrassed air, too, like a country clodhopper appearing in fashionable	society, and was nearly always stiff and unhappy in his off-hand remarks. The	least creditable performance en route was his attempt to say something on the	question of tariff legislation in his Pittsburgh speech. What he said was	really nothing but crude, ignorant twaddle, without point or meaning. It proved	him to be the veriest novice in economic matters, and strengthened my doubts as	to his capacity for the high office he was to fill. So poor was his talk that	most of the Republican papers, while they printed it, abstained from comment.	<p>		<p>		<p>		After ten days of the wearisome sameness of the "performances" at the several	halting-places, I was very sick of the "traveling show," and I therefore asked	to be relieved from my duties on reaching new York. My request was granted, and	I remained behind. It turned out that I lost only the reception in Independence	Hall in Philadelphia, as the journey was cut short by the incognito night run	of the President from Harrisburg to Washington. This sudden move on his part	created at the time considerable disappointment, even among his warmest	political followers, being regarded as an evidence of unwarranted fear. But	subsequent events and developments proved his course to have been a wise one.<p></blockquote><p><p><hr><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" height=10><br><nobr><a href="#top"><img src="../../../images/bt-toppg.gif" width=31 height=23 border=0 alt="Top"></a><a href="../../../index.htm"><img src="../../../images/bt-home.gif" width=43 height=23 border=0 alt="Home"></a></nobr><p><font size=1>"Recollections of Lincoln," from The Atlantic Monthly, February, 1904, issue.Vol. 93, No. 556 (p.165-174).</font><p></body></html>

<blockquote>	

	

<font size=5>N</font>O ONE EXPECTED the huge response that <A 

HREF="gioia.htm">"Can Poetry 

Matter?"</A> generated, especially not its author.  I wrote the essay to 

address -- as directly and candidly as possible -- the increasing 

cultural isolation of American poetry.  Although I did not set out to 

provoke controversy, I knew my criticism of the institutions which dominate 

the poetry subculture would prove unpopular in some literary circles.  

Institutions -- be they military, medical, corporate or cultural -- do not 

welcome outside criticism.  The editors of <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I> had 

warned me to expect angry letters from interested parties.  When the hate 

mail arrived, typed on letterheads of various university writing programs, 

no one was surprised.<P>



What did surprise both the <I>Atlantic </I>editors and me, however, was 

the enormously positive reaction the article created.  As soon as "Can 

Poetry Matter?" was published, the responses began.  Letters poured into 

<I>The Atlantic</I>, copies of which they shipped to me in thick bundles.  

Other mail came to me directly or through my publishers.  Reporters phoned 

at the office for interviews.  Newspaper and magazine articles appeared.  

Radio producers asked me to discuss the article on the air.  Friends 

phoned with anecdotes about the article's impact.  Strangers called to ask 

advice.  And for months the mail continued.  Eventually I received over 

400 letters from <I>Atlantic</I> readers.  They were overwhelmingly 

favorable.  Many of them felt I had not gone far enough in criticizing the 

inbred nature of the poetry world.<P>



I experienced my 15 minutes of fame with mixed emotions.  I was flattered 

by the magnitude of response.  I had hoped my article would initiate fresh 

discussion about the problems facing American poetry.  The newspaper 

clippings, which friends sent me, indicated that writers and readers 

across the country were heatedly debating the issues I had raised.  

Although some academic poets dismissed my analysis categorically, it was 

clear that the rest of the literary community took the article seriously, 

even if they disagreed with particular points in my argument.  What better 

response could an author want?<P>



Yet, as each new bundle of responses arrived, I grew more depressed.  The 

letters came in three familiar varieties -- favorable, unfavorable, and 

incoherent -- but, though they differed in tone and intent, together they 

formed an alarming map of American literary culture.  Reading through them 

each night after work, I realized that the poetry world was even more 

divided than I thought.  Virtually all of the unfavorable mail came from 

Creative Writing professionals.  Composed in the key of outraged virtue, 

these letters made three assertions: first, American poetry had never been 

healthier than today; second, poetry was thriving in the university, and, 

third, except for poets themselves, few people in America had ever cared 

much for poetry.  I had expected the first two assertions.  Examining the 

self-serving assumption behind those comforting clich&eacute;s had been the 

point of my article.  The third assertion, which appeared in dozens of 

letters, however, astonished me.  Several letters mentioned <A 

HREF="../emilyd/edintro.htm">Emily Dickinson</A> as an example of the 

poet's position in America before university writing programs began.  Her 

example is inspiring, but it hardly typifies poetry's historical position 

in American society.  How had the assumption that poetry never mattered 

originated, especially among academics who should know some literary 

history?  Had they never read about Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 

international fame?  <I>The Courtship of Miles Standish</I> sold 15,000 

copies on its first day of publication.  Did they not know how John 

Greenleaf Whittier had helped inspire the Abolitionist movement?  His 

poems were not only memorized but set to music as hymns.  He even had a 

town named after him.  Had they never heard that James Whitcomb Riley was 

so popular that his birthday became a state holiday in Indiana?  During 

Riley's final illness, President Wilson sent anxious inquiries about his 

condition.  President Theodore Roosevelt not only reviewed E.  A.  

Robinson's poetry; he also obtained him civil service sinecure in the Wall 

Street Customs House.  Robinson's later books attained the best-seller 

list.  After publishing <I>Fatal Interview</I> in 1931, Edna St.  Vincent 

Millay developed such a large audience that she was hired to deliver a 

series of poetry readings on commercial network radio.  Carl Sandburg was 

asked to address a joint session of Congress.  <A 

HREF="../frost/frostint.htm">Robert Frost</A> spoke at a Presidential 

inauguration.  One could cite dozens of other examples.<P>



Only the amnesiac can claim poetry was never popular in America.  From the 

days of Bryant and Emerson, it played 

an important role in American intellectual life -- until recently.  Surely 

it was critical for contemporary poets to understand how its position had 

become marginal.  To rationalize away poetry's current isolation by 

pretending it had always been ignored revealed a depressing brand of 

intellectual complacency.<P>



Reading the many supportive letters and articles did not especially cheer 

me up, but they did teach me a great deal about the remaining non-academic 

audience for poetry.  Isolated and disenfranchised, poetry's common 

readers still exist.  I heard from hundreds of these refugees -- 

teachers, retirees, librarians, lawyers, housewives, business executives, 

ranchers, and reporters, all of whom care passionately for poetry.  The 

emotion in their letters took me by surprise.  They feel alienated from 

what they see as a self-enclosed poetry world, and they are angry at the 

university for sequestering poetry.  I was also astonished to discover how 

many readers -- and journalists -- still resent modernism (which 

they also associate with the university) for killing the traditional kinds 

of poetry they enjoy.  Na&iuml;vely, I had thought the battle for 

modernism had been fought and finished fifty years ago.  What affected me 

most was the tone of hopeless resignation in many letters.  Americans had 

stopped reading poetry, they confided, and little could be done to remedy 

the situation.  A particularly memorable letter came from a woman in 

Oregon.  She wrote about how important the poems she knew by heart were to 

her daily sanity.  She could not understand why her son cared so little 

for poetry.  She knew he was typical of his generation and worried that 

something spiritually important was being lost in our society.  I wrote 

her an inadequate reply and mused at how, in different ways, hundreds of 

other letters echoed her concern.  The image of these people sticks with 

me.  They represent a large audience which is slowly dying from neglect.  

Some experts claim this audience no longer exists.  Soon perhaps it 

won't.<P>



I feel that one reason "Can Poetry Matter?" had such a strong impact was 

that I wrote the article not as a poet or critic but as a reader of 

poetry.  Jorge Luis Borges once confessed that he thought of himself first 

as a reader and only then as a poet or writer of fiction.  A writer's 

loyalties must lie with literature, not merely his or her own ambitions.  

I conceived of "Can Poetry Matter?" as a non-partisan analysis of poetry's 

current dilemma.  I tried as much as possible to suppress my personal 

poetic agenda and discuss my frustrations and aspirations as a reader of 

poetry and poetry criticism.  Of course, my detractors will claim 

otherwise, and they may indeed notice biases to which I myself am blind.  

Dana Gioia the reader cohabits the same skull as Dana Gioia the writer.  

But I take it as a good sign that several poets with whom I am often 

grouped by critics became angry with me because they felt the piece did 

not put forth a particular agenda.   One long-time friend denounced me to 

my face because the essay did not offer New Formalism as the cure to the 

ills of American poetry.  A few weeks later a bitter enemy wrote me a long 

fan letter.  Disinterested criticism, I discovered, makes strange 

bedfellows.<P>



I learned one other thing from the reception of my article.  When a piece 

of writing gains enough notoriety to create controversy, the responses it 

generates often have little to do with the original text.  The author has 

struck a nerve, usually by examining an issue others have ignored or 

distorted.  When all the repressed energy is suddenly released, it takes 

its own shape.  For most respondents the text itself is merely a point of 

departure.  Reading the various articles and editorials inspired by "Can 

Poetry Matter?", I was interested to see how often I was invoked to 

support an idea I disliked or to condemn a notion I endorsed.  This can be 

either amusing or annoying.  The important thing is to step aside and let 

the ideas pursue their own dialectic.  The culture is now at work, and the 

author has become only one of the spectators.<p>

That is the folksong the music boxes play in Ernst Lubitsch's lilting romantic comedy The ShopAround the Corner. What was missing from the article, the friend wassuggesting, was Pauline's tune--or Kael's, I should say here, so as not tosound too familiar, although she has been one of my best friends for nearlytwenty years. Maybe I can hum a few bars.<p><p>Nothing too lilting. She spent a recent massage session (it's therapeutic, forher Parkinson's--she is determined not to tremble like Katharine Hepburn) lyingprone and listening to piped-in classical composers and marveling, "How didthey get away with some of that crap?" As a moppet in northern California, shecut short her own violin-prodigy career by getting up before a synagogueaudience, whose expressions of fond expectancy rubbed her the wrong way, andswinging into "Onward Christian Soldiers." If you are among those readers whosefavorite movies Kael has ripped the underbellies out of, you might see thatperformance as an early sign that the key to her is perversity. No, I'd sayit's D-sharp, for Dionysian acuity. No, not acute Dionysianism. True, she ledoff her review of one of her favorite movies, Nashville, by calling it an orgy.But just try to slip something really dirty past her, as she thought thedirector of A Clockwork Orange did.<p><p>When I pass a newsstand and see the saintly, bearded, intellectual Kubrick onthe cover of Saturday Review, I wonder: Do people notice things like the wayKubrick cuts to the rival teen-age gang just so we can have the pleasure ofwatching that gang strip the struggling girl they mean to rape? . . . That girlis stripped for our benefit; it's the purest exploitation. . . .<p><p>How can people go on talking about the dazzling brilliance of movies and notnotice that the directors are sucking up to the thugs in the audience?<p><p>Generally vigilance is defensive, but Kael has had no theory or system,aesthetic or political, to defend. She has been lustily vigilant. She no longerreviews movies, because, at seventy-five and in frail health, she doesn't feelup to the physical effort. She stepped up to all comers (within reason) withher heart on her sleeve and her mind working overtime. No wonder she took it sopersonally when movies stank, or when they inspired "goofy rapture," or whenthey were just not quite all that one might have wished: "And so the ironies inThe Man Who Would Be King go by fast--when we want them to vibrate a little."This helps to account for the enormous resentment she stirred in many readers,who may have felt that she wouldn't let them pick up a movie's vibes forthemselves: it was as if she were telling them how they were turned on by alover, or why they shouldn't have been. But it also helps to account for whyher reviews are still great reading, and not just as personal essays but asinspired and hearty attempts to evoke upon the page a movie's "OchiChyorniye."<p><p>Kael's latest book, For Keeps: Thirty Years at the Movies, is professedly herlast--her own selection from a three-million-word corpus of criticism andreporting. She retired from regular reviewing for The New Yorker three yearsago, and for several years before that she was casting a cold eye on her ownpowers, like a great athlete who wanted to be the first to detect the slowingof her reflexes. "I don't jump out of bed every morning eager to work anymore,"she told me when her writing was still full of vigor, "and I don't rememberevery detail of the movies I see."<p><p>"Pauline," I said, "I've been that way since I was fourteen." I told her I hadfinally caught up to one of her favorite entertainments, the 1940 Thief ofBagdad. "Oh, good," she said, and asked me about a minuscule bit of businessshe wasn't sure she remembered correctly from seeing the film when it came out.I had seen it the night before, and I didn't even remember the scene.<p><p>In the late 1960s and the 1970s her schmoozy yet magisterial apercus inspiredwidespread emulation among the young. Now college kids tend not to have heardof her. Nearly all of Kael's thirteen books are still in print in England, butin this country most of what is available is For Keeps.<p><p>It's more than 1,300 pages long, and more than 600,000 words: "a brick," as sheputs it. Bullion, I would say, to use a word that not only means "gold in mass"but also derives from an old verb meaning "to bubble, to boil." In theinterests of full disclosure, I should say that back in the seventies Kaeltalked a couple of movie studios into giving me my only two screenwriting gigs,and the $50,000 or so I realized carried me through an otherwise hardscrabbleperiod as a freelance writer. The purely financial benefit of knowing her hasprobably not been entirely offset by the looks of horror that influentialHollywood figures gave me in succeeding years when I told them she was one ofmy heroes, so perhaps I should recuse myself from writing about her book andher.<p><p>But knowing a person she is reviewing has never inhibited Kael. Some years agoI gave her and another woman, who was meeting her for the first time, a ridefrom New York City to western Massachusetts, where Kael and I are neighbors.Kael remarked regretfully that her review of Stardust Memories had caused WoodyAllen to end their friendship.<p><p>"What a shame," the woman said, "that he took it so personally."<p><p>"Oh, no," Kael said. "It was vicious."<p><p>Merciless, anyway, in its assault on a widely cherished yet repellent film.Kael has always had a particular taste for (as in Brian De Palma) "the dirtyfun of a bad boy." Allen was the darling of New York taste-setters for havinggone beyond such fun to a higher-toned mixture of introspection, sentiment, andsatire. Kael picked up on not only what Stardust Memories was curdled by butwhat it was all about: Allen's slide into self-hatred, sentimentality, anddisdain for his audience. Now that accepted opinion deplores Allen as aself-absorbed, dysfunctional stepfather, Kael's review of Stardust Memories,reprinted in For Keeps, resonates like a perfect-pitch blow of the whistle. Thesemi-autobiographical character Allen plays, she wrote in 1980, "is superior toall those who talk about his work; if they like his comedies, it's for freakishreasons, and he shows them up as poseurs and phonies, and if they don't likehis serious work, it's because they're too stupid to understand it. Heanticipates almost anything that you might say about Stardust Memories andridicules you for it."<p><p>To such a challenge Kael was bound to rise. While she was at it, she gaveAllen's earlier work its due: he "helped to make people feel more relaxed abouthow they looked and . . . about their sexual terrors and everything else thatmade them anxious." But if there is anything that Kael can't abide (besidestrendy propaganda), it is contempt mixed with bogus romanticizing.<p><p>"Manhattan was also full of naughty, self-centered types: he contrasted theirlack of faith with the trusting, understanding heart of a loyal child--playedby Mariel Hemingway. (What man in his forties but Woody Allen could pass off apredilection for teen-agers as a quest for true values?)"<p><p>Neither this assessment nor Allen's personal reaction to it meant that Kael hadturned her back on his work. She praised several of his movies after StardustMemories, and after she quit reviewing, she urged all her friends to see hispost-scandal comedy Manhattan Murder Mystery. If she had never liked his work,she would never have been friendly with him. Tell Kael that you enjoyed a moviethat she thought was, as she might put it, not . . . very . . . good, and shewill say "Oh" in a certain tone and look at you--whoever you are, even if youare, say, me--as if you'd said you'd gotten a kick out of Goebbels's speech theother night. Some people find this absolutism off-putting--well, everybodydoes. She can say things that make you feel that the room has been flushed withacid. But she's an affable, cheery person to meet. She was quite cordial to oneof my son's friends whom I took to meet her one night at dinner. This youngman, a big fan of hers, confided that The Man Who Came to Dinner was hisfavorite movie. "Oh," she said. "See it again. It won't be."<p><p>Filmmakers sometimes arranged early screenings for Kael and called to ask herwhat she thought. She was the most eloquent appreciator in print of RichardPryor's best work, but when he called to ask her opinion of his dispiritingautobiographical JoJo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling before its release, she gaveit to him straight: it was hopeless. In her heyday several tables in thedownstairs rooms of her big turreted shingle house in Great Barrington, whichshe and her daughter, Gina, restored from a shambles in 1970 (she made the downpayment on it with what The New Yorker paid her for running her Citizen KaneBook in installments), were always covered with neatly stacked bookmanuscripts, screenplay drafts, and unplaced articles sent to her by friends,acquaintances, and strangers asking for private opinions. She devoted anenormous amount of time to this reading, and to energetic encouragement anddiscouragement.<p><p>She is the least guilt-inducing woman I have ever known. Once when I was givingher a ride to the country, a big rain came up and flooded the Saw Mill RiverParkway. I took an ill-considered detour through a great accumulation ofwater--don't worry, I told her, I got this figured--and the car conked out.There I was, in a rickety Plymouth Horizon bumper-deep in the middle of rushingwater that must have been 200 yards across, with a physically delicate,environmentally hypersensitive (bugbites swell her up disastrously),sixty-odd-year-old woman who was the most acerbic critic in America; to boot, Ididn't know exactly where we were, except probably in the state of New York. Itwas getting dark. The water was rising. I have had a loving mother and severaleminently-capable-of-wading sweethearts who would have given me deserved griefat that point. Kael's demeanor was perfectly sunny. I would have carried her toMassachusetts on my shoulders if necessary, but as it happened, I got the carcranked and we rooster-tailed out of there.<p><p>She slipped on ice and broke her nose trying to get to my one-man showoff-Broadway, and because I knew she had trouble getting around in the city(also because I wasn't sure I knew what I was doing onstage), I hadn't evenasked her to come. When I heard about her injury, from someone else, shepooh-poohed my concern. "We've never let each other down," she told me once. Idon't think anybody else has ever actually told me that.<p><p>She doesn't talk about her past much, but I can tell you a few things youprobably don't know about her. For instance, in the finals of a California highschool debate competition one year in the mid-thirties, Kael's opponent wasCarol Channing. Perhaps this is one of those supernal matchups you would preferto speculate about endlessly (Who would win, Captain Marvel or King Kong?Mother Courage or Auntie Mame?), but I am constrained to report that accordingto Kael, Carol Channing was very bright and her team came in first, but Kaelprevailed in the one-on-one.<p><p>Here's a poser: Who would win, Kael or Dr. Johnson? She has bestridden filmcriticism as colossally as he in his day bestrode letters, and neither ofthem--in print or in person--left room for disagreement. Johnson wasacknowledged as a giant. The Kirkus review of For Keeps fell in with many ofKael's past critics by calling her intelligence "quirky" and averring that she"thought quite highly of herself and her judgment." Kael would be the lastperson in the world to plead from gender, but I asked her recently, "Would yourreception be different if you were a man?"<p><p>"Yes," she said.<p><p>Maybe even if she were taller. Her physical tininess should have no more to dowith her "Ochi Chyorniye" than Johnson's hulkingness with his, but, she says inher introduction to For Keeps, "I think that the disjunction between my strongvoice as a writer and my five-foot frame somehow got to people. . . . peoplewho don't like my writing find it both Olympian and smart-alecky. I guess atsome level it is."<p><p>She was the youngest of five kids, growing up on a farm in Petaluma. Herbrothers used to throw her back and forth between them like a ball, to herdelight. The animals chased her. As a child, she was regarded as such aninspired comedian that her parents thought she might be the next Fanny Brice.Before she got into movie reviewing she wrote plays that were produced forradio but never for the stage. "Back then, no one produced anything unless ithad jugglers in it." She once had a husband (she had a few, but this is aboutall I know of her marital history) who, believe it or not, made her feel thatshe couldn't do anything right, the way Katharine Hepburn's fiance does in Patand Mike. Once, in a hardware store in Great Barrington, a salesman who did notknow her pointed to a sign saying Father's Day Special and said, "That goes foryou, too, Mom." Kael's response was, "Fuck you, too, Charlie."<p><p>She is almost certainly the only New Yorker writer who ever said to WilliamShawn, that magazine's late, sainted, editor, "Oh, come off it, Bill," draggedhim downstairs, and made him play the piano at an office party. She used tomake Shawn turn bright red in the face (more from apoplexy than embarrassment)by insisting on keeping explicit sexual references in her copy. Shawn washimself a connoisseur of bawdy humor, but he was as obsessed with keeping smutout of his magazine as Joe McCarthy was with getting Communists out of thegovernment. (Once, he turned down a piece of mine that entailed a man and awoman getting Super Glued together, quite nonsexually, in a dry-cleaningestablishment, because he worried about how they would go to the bathroom.)<p><p>I have always felt that Renata Adler attacked Kael so hysterically in The NewYork Review of Books in 1980 because Adler, a paragon of New Yorker tone,resented Kael's having managed to keep her own voice. Other women writers atThe New Yorker, Kael claimed, would cry in order to get their way with Shawn.Kael had the nerve to ask Shawn to rewrite his introduction to her 5001 Nightsat the Movies because she found the first version to be "overflorid." And hedid.<p><p>After all, she had occasionally consented to make alterations for Shawn. Once,she showed me proofs of her forthcoming review of Reds. Warren Beatty, she hadwritten, played John Reed as "p____y-w_____d." That's the way it had been setin type, presumably because even the compositor was horrified. Shawn hadadjured her to come up with some other term. She couldn't understand why. Itwas the right word, she insisted.<p><p>"Jesus, Pauline," I said. "You can't say 'pussy-whipped' in The New Yorker!"(You couldn't then.) "How about 'uxorious'?" She rolled her eyes. Eventuallyshe gave in to Shawn on that one, and recast the sentence, but I still feelproud of her for trying. Let me think how to put this: the two most startlingand refreshing moments of my intellectual life as a semi-apostate male GeorgiaMethodist emigre were when I realized that Kael really didn't see why she couldnot use in The New Yorker a down-home adjective that I would hesitate to use inconversation among close female friends, and when she observed during a verybrief biblical discussion in my car one afternoon that the New Testament was "abit sticky."<p><p>In For Keeps she has not included her review of Reds. It was largely negative,partly because she found it trendily old-Hollywood leftist. I attended thespecial screening of Reds that was held for her. This was not long after shehad returned to reviewing after being lured by Beatty out to Hollywood tobecome, at fifty-nine, a producer-consultant at Paramount.<p>During this period Kael felt, to my astonishment, that I could write a movie,and arranged a development deal for me. She didn't intervene in the writing ofthe script, although she got it Xeroxed for me, because I couldn't afford to atthe time. She liked it. Paramount didn't. Though she received no screen creditsduring her five months in the business, she says she helped get several moviesinto production, including The Elephant Man. Kael returned to Great Barringtonand The New Yorker no more compromised by having worked for Paramount thanOrwell was by fighting in the Spanish civil war.<p><p>I would like to be able to report that her discernible reactions at the Redsscreening were somehow revealing. But it was usually hard to tell how Kael hadresponded to a movie until she started talking about it, some minutes after itwas over. Sometimes I would feel impelled to state my reaction before she had achance to. I remember that as soon as the credits for Jonathan Demme'sSomething Wild had finished rolling, I turned to her and said, "Now, I likedthat!" "You did, huh?" she said in a steely sort of way. For a minute I thoughtshe hadn't liked it, but I think it was just that she was still tasting it. Shecame away from Reds looking the same way she looked leaving other movies thatdisappointed her: let down.<p><p>I don't know how to suggest that the general reader take For Keeps into his orher life. I know that 5001 Nights at the Movies richly accompanies my ownwatching of old movies on television. Many people with whom I have argued aboutKael have said, "Okay, she's a good writer. But her opinions about movies . .." Are perverse. Or quirky. No, they aren't. Try watching Love in theAfternoon, with Gary Cooper and Audrey Hepburn. The newspaper listings or yourstandard movie-on-TV guide will probably pronounce it a classic. But if you arelike me, when you watch it you think, Jeez, this is a maundering old guysomehow assumed to be attractive to this beautiful gamine. So you pick up 5001Nights and you read, "Gary Cooper, looking as if he knows how unappealing he isin the role . . ."<p><p>I also recommend taking 5001 Nights along with you to the video store. Wonderwhether Voyage Surprise, by the Prevert brothers, is worth taking home? Couldbe, if only to satisfy your curiosity over Kael's note: "With Martine Carol,and the dwarf Pierre Pieral, who's like a miniature Bette Davis." Tempted tocheck out Summer and Smoke? Maybe not after reading "There's supposed to besomething on fire inside Alma, Tennessee Williams' lonely, inhibited preacher'sdaughter, but from Geraldine Page's performance and Peter Glenville's direction'tain't smoke that rises--just wispy little old tired ideas goin' to rejoin theHoly Ghost."<p><p>For Keeps is not such a handy reference. It's one of the thickest one-volumecompendiums (two and eleven-sixteenths inches) of anybody's work I've seen.It's shaped like something you might want to pull off the shelf and read aloudfrom with the whole family gathered around, but you'd need to have a familythat is receptive, all together, to sentiments like "a little nose-thumbingisn't enough . . . we want the subversive gesture carried to the domain ofdiscovery." The publisher talked her out of calling it The Bedside PaulineKael, but bed is a good place for it--I have myself more than once drifted offto dreamland savoring a passage like (on Vanessa Redgrave) "she can be majesticmore fluidly than anyone else (and there's more of her to uncoil)."<p><p>Reading For Keeps also provides an opportunity to argue with Kael without herbeing there. It's no fun to disagree with Kael about a movie. It's like arguingwith an umpire. She has made her call. Trying to talk to her about what mightbe wrong with her opinion of a movie is no more rewarding than it would be totalk to the director about what might be wrong with the movie after it's out;she doesn't seem to have second thoughts. Of course, who does have muchinterest in going into what's wrong with what he or she has already done? It'snot surprising that directors break off their dialogue with Kael after she hasdisparaged their work. Paul Schrader remained her friend after she wrote, abouthis Hardcore, "For Schrader to call himself a whore would be vanity: he doesn'tknow how to turn a trick." But then, their friendship dates back to well beforehe became a director.<p><p>When I told Kael, some years ago, that I didn't like Robert Altman's Nashville(which she called, among other things, "the funniest epic vision of Americaever to reach the screen"), she was content to reply that southerners of heracquaintance tended to have such a reaction. Well, damn right. But it wasn'tjust that Nashville seemed to me culpably ignorant of Nashville and countrymusic. (Kael in fact has been good on several other movies involving southernculture.) I'm an Altman rooter, but--no doubt partly because Kael's ecstaticreview had so raised my expectations--Nashville struck me as slack, overblown,and full of stragglers (for instance, Jeff Goldblum driving up portentously ona motorcycle at odd moments). And the songs! Whoever got the idea thatHollywood actors could write their own, bad or good, country songs? Rereadingher review, I still keep saying, "What?" It bothers me that I am so unmoved bya movie about which she wrote, "You don't get drunk on images, you're notoverpowered--you get elated. I've never before seen a movie I loved in quitethis way: I sat there smiling at the screen, in complete happiness."<p><p>It is also hard for me to see why she loved Last Tango in Paris quite so much.This and Nashville were her two most over-the-top enthusiasms. She reviewedboth of them well ahead of their general release, and she found both of them tobe enormous advances in movie consciousness. Well, when your drinking buddy oryour favorite teacher introduces you to the person he or she has fallen headover heels for and you can't see the attraction, maybe you're jealous. Maybeyou had to be there, at the advance screening. I wasn't present when Last Tangowas shown for the first time, at the New York Film Festival on the night ofOctober 14, 1972--a night Kael compared, in her review, to the night Le Sacredu Printemps was first performed. If I had been, maybe I, too, would have been"in a state of shock," or I could have talked Kael out of it. (ha!) When I didhie myself to a theater, expecting to see something that "altered the face ofan art form," I was impressed by Maria Schneider's nakedness, but as a figureof graphic lust she was no Georgina Spelvin. "She carries the whole history ofmovie passion in her long legs and baby face"? I didn't find Marlon Brando'sgrunting possession of her to be so drastically erotic. Call me old-fashioned,but I found him more pansexual when, as in A Streetcar Named Desire, he kepthis pants on.<p><p>I think Kael reserves her highest admiration for movies that get the better ofher, or at least push her to the limits of her acumen. She wants to lose it atthe movies, for movies to be good enough for that to happen. It's a seemlydesire, rare in an exacting critic. In another review she wrote, "The Moment ofTruth raises emotions that neither its moviemaking team nor we can fullycomprehend, and so the material draws us in and stays with us." Of Tango shewrote, "It's like seeing pieces of your life, and so, of course, you can'tresolve your feelings about it--our feelings about life are never resolved.Besides, the biology that is the basis of the 'tango' remains." She got thatright.<p><p>People have often accused her of reacting against popular views. In herearliest writings, to be sure, she devoted a good deal of energy to disparagingthe opinions of other critics. But once she got established herself, sheoverlooked conventional wisdom. Check out her review of The Color Purple. Otherreviewers charged Steven Spielberg with taking a modern African-Americanclassic and turning it into a cartoon. Kael ignores the assumption of classicand transcends the shorthand of cartoon. She doesn't debunk the notion thatAlice Walker is a great writer; she just alludes in passing to Walker's"rampant female chauvinism," takes note of the novel's "joyous emotionalswing," and, after accusing Spielberg of approaching this "'serious'" projectwith timidity, allows that "the Walker material has about as much to do withcharacter studies as Disney's Song of the South did. . . . The people on thescreen are like characters operated by Frank Oz. But they're not much phonierthan the people in the book: Spielberg's problem is that he can't give thematerial the emotional push of that earthy folk style of Walker's. He justdoesn't have the conviction that she has. . . ."<p><p>"He sees Georgia in 1909 the way a European director might; visually thepicture suggests Song of the South remade by Visconti."<p><p>Nobody else could have written that--not because nobody else has written aboutmovies with such dash but because nobody else has seen movies so disabusedly,with such a depth of perspective. No one is likely to read For Keeps straightthrough. I dipped around in it, thinking not so much "What great writing" as"What an interesting movie that was."<p><p>Much has been averred about Kael's prose style, but most of it has beenreductive. Here, from her review of Diva, is a quick snatch of prose that mightseem quintessential: "The unfazable Alba is the post-Godardian tootsie--in hershort-short skirts and transparent plastic coat, she's a lollipop wrapped incellophane." To those who think that her use of words like "sleazo" and"klutzburger" is what typifies her style, "post-Godardian tootsie" may seememblematic. And hey--it's sharp and it fits, both the character and the film.But it's just a snippet. What impresses me, as a person who labors to say whathe means in magazines, is the jam-packed fluidity of such passages as these,which deal with, respectively, Marilyn Monroe, Steven Spielberg, and Brian DePalma:<p><p>"Her mixture of wide-eyed wonder and cuddly drugged sexiness seemed to get tojust about every male; she turned on even homosexual men. And women couldn'ttake her seriously enough to be indignant; she was funny and impulsive in a waythat made people feel protective. She was a little knocked out; her face lookedas if, when nobody was paying attention to her, it would go utterly slack--asif she died between wolf calls."<p><p>"Nobody cuts faster on shots full of activity than he does, yet it's never justfor the sake of variety: it's what the movie is about that generates the imagesand the cutting pattern, and there's a constant pickup in excitement from shotto shot--a ziggety forward motion."<p><p>"In the Metropolitan sequence (the interiors are actually the PhiladelphiaMuseum of Art), we catch glimpses of figures slipping in and out at the edgesof the frame, and there are other almost subliminal images; we're playinghide-and-seek along with Kate, and her pickup. Later, there's a visuallylayered police-station sequence: the principal characters--Mike; Dr. Elliott;Kate's whiz-kid son, Peter (Keith Gordon); a loud, brash investigator,Detective Marino (Dennis Franz); and a pretty, investment-minded hooker, LizBlake (Nancy Allen)--are in different rooms or in the hallway, but they can seeeach other through the glass partitions, and the interplay among these people,most of whom have never met before, seems to be happening on about eighteendifferent levels of deception, eavesdropping, and all-around peeping. . . ."<p><p>"Dressed to Kill isn't as imaginatively dark as The Fury; the evil wasluxuriant in that one--nightshade in bloom. There's nothing here to match thefloating, poetic horror of the slowed-down sequence in which Amy Irving andCarrie Snodgrass are running to freedom: it's as if each of them and each ofthe other people on the street were in a different time frame, and CarrieSnodgrass's face is full of happiness just as she's flung over the hood of acar."<p><p>I can't tell you how pleased I am by that writing. (That punctuation. When shewas still living in the Bay Area, she says, a rumor got around that she haddone away with herself, because someone found an anonymous suicide note on theGolden Gate Bridge "that displayed my use of the colon.") It resists beingfocused upon as fine writing--the last sentence is an unselfconsciouslyseamless joining of, say, Elizabeth Bowen and James M. Cain. Nobody cuts fasteron shots full of activity than Kael does, yet it's never just for the sake ofvariety. It's what the prose is about that generates the images and the cuttingpattern, and there's a constant pickup in excitement from sentence tosentence--a ziggety forward motion.<p><p>Now I want to talk about rape. If there is anyone who is above (orbelow--whichever is superior) political correctness, it is Kael. ("Women's-libsensitivity may be the worst blow to drama since fifties-TV Freud.") I haveheard her express the opinion that the woman on whose story the movie TheAccused is based should have had more sense than to vamp drunkenly in apoolroom full of buttheads. Here is what she wrote about Hud, in 1964:<p><p>"I suppose we're all supposed to react on cue to movie rape (or as is usuallythe case, attempted rape): rape, like a cattle massacre, is a box-office value.No doubt in Hud we're really supposed to believe that Alma is, as StanleyKauffmann says, "driven off by [Hud's] vicious physical assault." But in termsof the modernity of the settings and the characters, as well as the age of theprotagonists (they're at least in their middle thirties), it was more probablethat Alma left the ranch because a frustrated rape is just too sordid andembarrassing for all concerned--for the drunken Hud who forced himself uponher, for her for defending herself so titanically, for young Lon the innocentwho "saved" her. Alma obviously wants to go to bed with Hud, but she has beenrejecting his propositions because she doesn't want to be just another casualdame to him; she wants to be treated differently from the others. If Lon hadn'trushed to protect his idealized view of her, chances are that the next morningHud would have felt guilty and repentant, and Alma would have been grateful tohim for having used the violence necessary to break down her resistance, thusproving that she was different. They might have been celebrating ritual rapesannually on their anniversaries."<p><p>"Rape is a strong word when a man knows that a woman wants him but won't accepthim unless he commits himself emotionally. Alma's mixture of provocativecamaraderie plus reservations invites "rape." "<p><p>Okay, now read this from Kael's review of De Palma's Casualties of War, in1989. Her paean to this movie has often been cited as evidence that herjudgment had grown erratic: how could a director long fascinated by violenceagainst women do justice to such a serious matter as GI rapists in Vietnam? ButCasualties of War is the one genuinely hard-to-swallow Vietnam movie.<p><p>"The men climb high above the valleys and set up a temporary command post in anabandoned hut in the mountains; it's here that the sobbing, sniffling girl isbrutalized. (Thereafter, she's referred to as "the whore" or "the bitch.") . .."<p><p>"And, whatever the soldiers say or do, there's the spectre of the dazed,battered girl ranting in an accusatory singsong. The movie is haunted by Oanhlong before she's dead. The rapists think they've killed her, but she rises; inour minds, she rises again and again."<p><p>There is no stance in either of these passages. There is genuine feeling andreceptivity. There is a roundness within which ambivalence pulses and so doesviolation. I admire Kael for how much she "hated" (a word not used lightly)Alan Parker's despicable Mississippi Burning, and for how much she relishedJonathan Demme's at-that-point-unrecognized Citizens Band. I tip my hat to herfor hailing Jessica Lange (in King Kong, which as a whole I did not treasure asmuch as she did) and Morgan Freeman well in advance of other critics, and forcalmly outflanking Lillian Hellman and Diana Trilling and Mary McCarthy andJane Fonda and Dashiell Hammett and whoever "Julia" may have been in her reviewof Julia, and for taking ungushy but resounding pleasure in Rip Torn and BetteMidler and Cary Grant and Marguerite Duras and Sam Peckinpah (whose movies,after all, are far more lively than those of Howard Hawks and John Ford andother testosteronic directors whom the auteurists accuse her of slighting) andBarbra Streisand and Robert Mitchum ("this great bullfrog with the puffy eyesand the gut that becomes an honorary chest") and The Stunt Man and(insufficient vibration aside) The Man Who Would Be King. <p><p>But I suggest that when contemporary dusts have settled and people are readingwhat was written about movies in our time, what will be most salient about whatKael has written will not be that she was slangy or that she put many peopleoff but that she watched movies so well that she was able to help us to seerape, for instance, steady and see it whole.<p>--------------------<p>Roy Blount Jr. is a contributing editor of The Atlantic Monthly.

	<font size=5>I</font>n a previous article, entitled 'The Defeat of the Schools,' which appeared in
the March *Atlantic*, I developed at some length the simple but dismaying
proposition that actual and effective standards in American public education
are deplorably and inexcusably low. This assertion is buttressed by a vast
assemblage of facts and findings, accumulated over many years by educational
research, some of which I cited. The work is not readily accessible to anyone
but the specialist. It is dull, uninviting, microscopic, and calls for critical
scrutiny. One must take in a great deal of it at a bird's-eye view before its
full import becomes clear. But, once comprehended, it is highly dramatic. The
situation revealed is enormously worse than any layman is apt to imagine. We go
through a set of complicated and costly motions called 'teaching' algebra,
geometry, physics, chemistry, history, English, Latin, and so forth. And what
happens? Almost nothing at all! This may seem incredible. But it is true. The
subjects are 'taught.' But they are not being learned.<p>

<p>

Such a survey forces upon one inevitable questions: What is wrong? What can be
done about it? It is the purpose of this paper to suggest an answer. In
particular I wish to call attention to a very comprehensive solution of the
problem of school reform which is coming to be known as the general-education
movement. Lest anyone anticipate another panacea, let me hasten to say that
workers in this field are decidedly restive at the suggestion that they really
constitute a 'movement' at all. The word is used only because no one can think
of a better. They know full well that America has been oversold on pedagogical
gadgets which never perform up to expectations, and they themselves have no
patent medicine to recommend. Moreover this 'movement' which objects to being
called a movement is not an affair of a few specially favored schools where
money is no object and pretty theories grow like weeds. A great many serious
and practical people, up against the daily problems of education in
public-school systems, undergraduate departments of universities, and colleges
all over the country, have been taking stock of the situation, and have not
found it good. Within recent years they have been discovering themselves in
substantial agreement about where the trouble really lies and what ought to be
done about it. Many of them, often unknown to one another, have been developing
new and promising plans of operation which, when compared, have striking
identities. There has been a coming together of minds, a consensus; and it is
only in this sense that the evolving pattern, though novel and definite enough,
can be called a 'movement.' (Notice the avoidance of capitals!)<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>I.</font></b><p>

<p>

The general-education movement, like all sound and hopeful beginnings, is a
plagiarism and expansion of the past. The large and growing group of workers on
whom the idea has dawned have a common starting point which is far from new.
They have begun by rediscovering for themselves that education really matters.
Old stuff, you may say, and fit only for commencement addresses? Well, perhaps!
But what if one really takes the idea seriously, and brings it into contact
with the lamentable spectacle of education as it now is? Then, surely, one may
expect something drastic and perhaps not unexciting to happen.<p>

<p>

To people who have caught and are catching the general education idea it seems
manifest that in a democratic civilization the supreme urgency is for every
individual effectively to inherit, possess, enjoy, and use his birthright of
culture. This, to be sure, is an old thought. It is an expansion of the
traditional American insistence that a free electorate must be an educated
electorate. But the implications of that well-worn doctrine carry far beyond
the limits of civic or electoral responsibility in the narrow sense. The
resources of human culture, accumulated through the ages by the spirit of man,
alone make possible a human way of living, whether in the home, in industry and
commerce, in the spheres of religion and recreation, or in politics. Only the
man who possesses them is capable of freedom, of living constructively in a
nexus of free institutions.<p>

<p>

But such values can come only from an education which consists in learning, in
mastery, in growing insight, in standards which really operate, and not just in
going to school. So when multitudes of young people accumulate credits, pass
courses, carry off elegant sheepskins, and come out knowing little or nothing,
it is simply intolerable. Culture is not elegance or ornament. It is the very
stuff of free and democratic living--infinitely too important to be handled in
any such cavalier and essentially dishonest fashion. When the patient toil of
educational research unmistakably demonstrates that the average pupil in school
fails to learn even though he succeeds in passing, that culture is not
penetrating the minds of millions of young Americans in spite of all that is
being done, it is no small matter. On the contrary, a disastrous lesion has
been revealed in the body politic, a choking off of the vital spiritual force
which is ultimately the only drive for a free society.<p>

<p>

When the worker in general education turns to the psychologist he learns
immediately and with emphasis that all this need not be. There is nothing in
the constitution of the human mind which prevents any average boy or girl from
really coming to terms with any one of the great segments of human culture. It
has been shown that a genuine and serviceable grasp of a foreign language can
be gained in a good deal less time than many high-school pupils take to learn
nothing worth while about it. English style can be improved; a love of
literature can be inculcated; a mastery of mathematical thinking can be
developed; an understanding of science can be built up, historical or aesthetic
insights can be acquired. Nothing, indeed, seems more certain than that the
average human being is capable of immensely diversified learning, and that he
can learn very rapidly and surely, with the enthusiasm which comes only from
speed and conscious success, given the right conditions and the right kind of
direction. The right conditions and the right kind of direction! This is what
has been lacking, and not some special, unique, and unattainable quality of
mind. The defeat of the schools in their major task of enabling the individual
to inherit his cultural birthright has been self-inflicted.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>II.</font></b><p>

<p>

So one may say that the general-education movement begins as a discontent and a
faith, both rooted solidly in ascertained fact--a recognition that a great and
urgent task is not being accomplished, and a reasoned belief that it can be.
But also it is more than this. While the workers associated with it are usually
suspicious of panaceas, they are largely agreed in diagnosing our educational
troubles, and also as to the kind of measures which ought to be taken. Let us
begin with the diagnosis.<p>

<p>

As these men and women have come to see the matter, the great source of
weakness in conventional school education is that it has been dominated by the
specialist. Here is at least a hint of why the term GENERAL education has come
into use, and of some of its implications. Now the specialist is concerned with
the CREATION of cultural materials--with discoveries in the laboratory, new
historical and social interpretations, the composition of works of art and
literature, and the like. Indeed the very raison d'etre of specialization is
that it is essential for such tasks. In order to make any significant mark as a
musician, or a mathematician, or a chemist, or a historian, it is necessary to
stay within bounds; and there is a tendency for the bounds to become narrower
as the specialty becomes more effective. Wander through the various floors of
the Michael Pupin building at Columbia University, and you will find on the
doors the names of more different kinds of physics than most reasonably
well-educated people ever heard of. The successful promotion of the science of
physics has brought into being and is reciprocally supported by all this
immense and impressive division of labor.<p>

<p>

Obviously the specialist is a most admirable and necessary person in the
laboratory or the library or the studio. Society owes him an enormous debt. But
put him in the schoolroom and he is likely to begin playing the part of the
bull in the china shop. He is in the position of a good production engineer
suddenly shunted into salesmanship. It is not his metier. If he is to function
at all well he must, for the nonce, stop being a specialist altogether. For the
production or creation of culture calls for one kind of disposition and
attitude, and the distribution of culture quite another.<p>

<p>

Of course the specialist rarely invades the public-school classroom in his own
proper person. But he gets there just the same, and exercises a dominating
influence that is nearly always unfortunate. He does this through the textbook
he has written, through the course of study on which he has advised, and above
all through the teacher who has 'majored' in his field, and who can imagine
nothing sweeter in life than to become a specialist himself. Here is
approximately how he goes to work.<p>

<p>

Professor Jones is a distinguished member of the mathematics department of
Brook University. He is approached by a publishing house with the proposal that
he prepare a textbook in algebra for ninth-grade pupils. The idea is somewhat
distasteful, because it will take him from research, and he regards research as
much more important than helping any number of ninth-graders. But he has a
summer home which seems to swallow money endlessly, and so with a sigh he
consents. What should go into the textbooks. Well, obviously, the elements of
algebra. He has a well-marked trail to follow, worn smooth by the feet of many
a specialist before him. There must be the fundamental operations, the use of
brackets, factorization, the management of fractions, logarithms, equations up
to and including simple quadratics, arithmetic and geometric proressions, some
graphs. Perhaps he makes a few additions and introduces timid variants of his
own. A novelty here and there helps sales, and certainly cannot do much harm
even when touted as the latest educational wrinkle. The job--a hack job, for
all that it may be faithfully done--is soon put through, and he returns with
relief to his more important labors, and awaits his royalty checks. This is not
an unfair picture of how a great many textbooks are 'made,' and how the
intellectual content to be taught to (but not learned by) American boys and
girls is determined and laid out.<p>

<p>

To the worker in general education every last thing about it seems wrong. Think
of what Professor Jones is supposed to be doing. He ought to be doing what
Wells did when he wrote *The Outline of History*, what Durant did when he wrote
*The Story of Philosophy*, what Van Loon did when he wrote *The Arts*, what
Hogben did when he wrote *Mathematics for the Million*. Only, being a
professional scholar, he ought to do a better job than at least three of these
gentlemen. He is performing an act of cultural salesmanship. Surely this ought
to be no cause for the slight tinge of shame, or at least of deprecation, with
which he approaches his task. He has a glorious bill of goods--the noble
science of mathematics. He has a glorious public--young minds which need
enlightenment and which are sure to respond eagerly to the real thing if only
they can get it. How shall he make mathematics real, vital, helpful to them, as
it can and ought to be? This is his central problem. As an attack upon such a
problem his procedure is nothing less than pitiable. Out of the great and
fascinating cultural wealth of mathematical thought and discovery and
adventure, what items does he select? Those which appeal to the specialist as
important for the reason that they are convenient starting points for the
further study of his specialty. But most boys and girls are not going to
continue to the advanced study of mathematics, so that nearly all the items he
lays out are of no conceivable use or interest to them. That is their hard
luck, and not the responsibility of Professor Jones. His responsibility is to
the 'elements' of algebra, not the pupils.<p>

<p>

Here, as a vast number of workers associated with the general-education
movement or idea have come to see the matter, is the real cause of weakness,
the real reason why learning in school is so excessively poor and scanty. The
trouble lies in the sheer sterility of the cultural materials which specialists
hemmed in by their specialties have selected for boys and girls to learn. No
methods or tricks or devices can put these materials across effectively,
because the breath of life is not in them. When one tries to improve learning
by picayune devices which are supposed to be 'psychological'--printing the book
in the right kind of type, fixing up the right kind of exercises and reviews,
introducing pictures, projects, mastery units, and so on endlessly--one is
concentrating on essentially secondary matters which have neither meaning nor
effect unless a primary condition is fulfilled. One must obey the first and
great commandment, or all the rest of the law is empty sound and sheer
futility. The stuff itself must be manifestly worth while. It must come home to
the learner as something worth learning, or it will never be effectively and
permanently acquired.<p>

<p>

So the worker in general education has come to see himself as standing between
the specialists who create culture and the pupils who consume it. He has even,
with some covert apologies, coined a barbarous and yet not unexpressive name
for himself. In contrast to the specialist he tends to call himself a
'generalist.' That is to say, he seeks to serve the interests of the
public--the pupils--vis-a-vis the cultural resources which must be brought to
them and which they surely and sorely need. What items will be most suitable to
the young mind? What items will most surely and quickly help that mind to see
what a great subject is all about? The analogy of the salesman, again, is very
close. The factory experts and accountants will certainly know far more than he
about various phases and details of the manufacturing process. But he knows
something hidden from them, and contributes a point of view and technique
without which their labors would be for naught. He knows what the public is
willing and able to take, what it wants, what it needs. In exactly the same way
the educational 'generalist' sees himself as collaborating with the specialist
and the expert, and working up what he produces into educationally viable and
vital materials.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>III.</font></b><p>

<p>

Such is the diagnosis. What shall be the prescription?<p>

<p>

Once more let me emphasize that the general-education movement does not
advocate any standard panacea. If you were to visit the Pasadena High School,
the General College at the University of Minnesota, and Bennington College, you
would certainly find what on the surface seem very different educational
arrangements in operation. This is just as it should be, for a formula which is
supposed to fit all situations is almost certain, in reality, to suit none of
them. What is amazing, however, is the extent to which educational
'generalists' are agreed in principle as to what ought to be done. The essence
of their claim is that conventional school procedures urgently need to be
simplified and rationalized. The ordinary high-school or college curriculum is
made up of a large number of narrow courses. To the general educator it appears
that we should follow just the opposite tack, and make a curriculum out of a
much smaller number of broad ones. Essentially the idea is just as simple as
that. Yet it strikes down to the very roots of the educational problem.<p>

<p>

The system of narrow courses which has fastened itself upon the American
schools in the past fifty years is highly unfortunate in two ways. It poses a
whole row of insoluble educational riddles; and it is a perfect opportunity for
the specialist to do his worst.<p>

<p>

Here is a pupil confronted with a curriculum made up of courses in commercial
arithmetic, elementary statistics, elementary algebra, advanced algebra, plane
geometry, solid geometry, analytics, trigonometry ancient history, medaeval
history, history of the Renaissance, modern history, economic history, and so
on ad infinitum. What chance has he to make a wise choice, even with the best
of advice? It is as bad as one of those huge bills of fare which drive one
frantic trying to choose a reasonable meal. Must one study geometry to be an
educated man? Must one know about the Renaissance? What about the Industrial
Revolution, which seems to have a certain importance also? It would be nice to
take something on the appreciation of pictures, but a course on music would
also be good. Yet unfortunately French gets in the way of both. Try to get some
kind of reasonable order into such a melange.<p>

<p>

But suppose that we have before us a curricular scheme which offers a broad
course in science as such,--not physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and so
forth, but science as such,--taking as much time as two or three of the
conventional minor narrow sequences; and another of the same kind in
literature; and another in the social studies; and yet another in the arts.
There is some reason in this. It is all the difference between a bewildering a
la carte and a well-planned table d'hote. It has immediately the look of a
classification of cultural materials in terms of the interests and needs of the
ultimate consumer, whereas the other has not. No elaborate argument is
necessary to show that a person who is to live a free and effective life in a
world such as ours needs to have access to science, literature, the social
studies, and the arts, and to be aware of their relationship to his own daily
choices and concerns. This surely is what being educated means. A person who
has to teach elementary geometry or beginning Latin to a group of young people
often finds it necessary to use the most fantastic arguments in an effort to
answer the inevitable question: What's the good of studying this stuff? The
ordinary reply is that it 'trains the mind.' Yet after all, why might not
stenography or dishwashing do that particular trick just as well? But if he is
teaching the nature and structure of language as an instrument of expression
and thought, or the meaning of mathematical thinking in the affairs of men past
and present, or effective standards of aesthetic appraisal, or opening up the
riches of world literature, he is not likely to be up against such a
difficulty. There is a fundamental sanity about the broad, encyclopedic course
which strongly tends to convince the learner that here is something worth
having.<p>

<p>

Then again, the narrow course is the happy hunting ground of the specialist. If
we propose to teach geometry or French to young people, there is not much
alternative in what must be done, unless one is prepared to sabotage the whole
system and introduce all sorts of material which has no relationship to the
announced title of the course. We do exactly what Professor Jones did in
writing his algebra text; that is to say, we select the 'elements' of the
subject--its easier techniques, whose meaning and value reside in the fact that
they are the basis for further study. Some leeway can be found in the order of
topics to be treated, and even in the topics to be introduced. But they will
all tend to be preparatory in character, instead of immediately interesting and
important. This means that for the great majority of pupils, who will never go
much further, the whole thing is a total loss. What shall it profit me to be
told of a glorious view at the ten-thousand-foot level when it is quite certain
that the first thousand feet will be my limit?<p>

<p>

In contrast with this, the essence of the broad course is immediacy. I teach,
let us say, elementary plane geometry. In that case I am almost obligated to
spend a good deal of time on the congruence of triangles. The topic, perhaps,
has considerable value for those who are going to have some sort of
mathematical future. But this is certainly a minority.<p>

<p>

Could I, then, make a course which would consist entirely of topics of current
and immediate concern and importance, and which would still deserve to be
called elementary plane geometry? It would be something of a tour de force. But
suppose I am teaching a course in mathematics as such then indeed the situation
is different. Here is a vastly greater wealth of material from which I may
choose, and there are no arbitrary boundary lines beyond which I must not go.
It may be very hard to arrange a course which in its very structure and content
will show the average pupil that geometry as a specialized, delimited subject
matters much to him. It ought not to be hard to arrange a course to show him
the significance and fascination of mathematics.<p>

<p>

<font size=4><b>IV.</font></b><p>

<p>

Instead of algebra, geometry, trigonometry--Mathematics; instead of Latin,
French, German--Linguistics; instead of physics, chemistry, biology,
physiology--Science; instead of music, painting, sculpture, the dance--Art;
instead of economics, sociology, anthropology--Social Studies; instead of
English literature, classical literature, French literature--The Humanities.
This is a type picture of the rationalized and simplified scheme. The narrow
subdivisions are proper for the specialist and for the intending specialist.
The broad areas are proper for the generally educated person, whose interests
and needs are the concern of the 'generalist.' It should be understood that the
particular layout of broad areas here mentioned is not the only one possible.
As a matter of fact, it varies widely in different places. The conception
reaches its ultimate limits in the tutorial plan at the college level, and in
the so-called 'integrated curriculum' in the elementary school. But it need not
be, and usually is not, pushed so far. The basic claim is that it provides a
much readier access to living and significant cultural materials, and makes it
much easier for the learner to perceive the relationship of those materials to
the concerns of his own living, than the plan of innumerable small
pigeonholes.<p>

<p>

Anyone who supposes that the change is one of name alone and not of fact should
sit in for a while with a group of workers who are laying out courses along
these lines. He would quickly find out that he was wrong. For instance, at the
present time the General Education Board is financing nation-wide activities in
the development of Science as a broad and unified area of study. Those
responsible for the venture are drawing upon the scholarly resources of
world-famous specialists in the various scientific fields. But the general
scheme in which all are collaborating is made in the interest of the pupil who
will never be a scientific expert of any kind, and who yet needs scientific
insights if he is to live intelligently. New and vital materials for teaching
are being developed and made available. For instance, soil erosion is a problem
whose living importance it is not hard to show to almost anybody. Where would
it come in the setup of specialized courses? The answer is: Nowhere at all. But
under the new plan it can be utilized as a curricular topic, and a whole range
of insights from almost all the sciences can be concentrated upon it. The work
I mention is perhaps the most ambitious single job now being carried on by
persons associated with the general-education movement. But the same thing is
happening on a considerable scale in many places in connection with the arts,
the humanities, the social studies, and so forth. A widespread and practical
curricular renewal is under way. <p>

<p>

Teachers who come in contact with reorganizations of this kind usually feel a
quite special thrill of enthusiasm. So many beautiful iridescent bubbles have
been blown in the educational world, and they have usually burst so soon, that
we all tend to be rather suspicious of new proposals. But here, at least, is
something at once forwardlooking and practical. It represents advance, but one
has the sensation that one's feet are on the ground.<p>

<p>

What, after all, are teachers trying to do? What is it all about, anyhow? They
are, surely, distributors of culture--salesmen, if you will. They want to
select those cultural elements which matter most here and now, which have the
greatest immediate and intrinsic significance and appeal. They know that unless
the learner himself recognizes the legitimacy of what he is being asked to
learn no skill and no pressure will ever lead to satisfactory and permanantly
worthwhile results. The impediment has been an organization of material into
endless narrow subdivisions; and this has meant that the material itself has
been deprived of life and value.<p>

<p>

The very things most obviously worthy to be learned by everybody are just the
things that cannot be put in pigeonholes. But they can be put in large
compartments. Very well, let us abandon the pigeonholes. This is sure to bring
with it changes in the whole structure of education in America the nature of
which cannot yet be clearly envisaged. Our entire system depends upon the
concept of credits accumulated in limited courses. If you abandon the limited
courses, what about the precious credits? Nobody knows yet, but we shall find
out. The effective dissemination of a living culture is a matter far too urgent
to be blocked by any conventions or any fetishes or vested interests, however
well established. Simplification, rationalization, the provision of cultural
materials whose manifest significance is the chief dynamic in their
acquisition--this is the prevailing direction of American school reform
today.

<h2> Commonly Asked Questions<br>
 About Willow Creek Community Church</h3>
 
<b>From <I>Rediscovering Church</I> by Bill Hybels (1995)</b><p>
</center>
<br>

<p>
<blockquote><font size=4><font
color="#23238e">
In starting Willow Creek volunteers went through the neighborhoods to ask
people why they didn't go to church and then made adjustments in order to
attract them. Isn't that tantamount to telling people only what they want to
hear?</font></font color><p>

<p>



It's amazing how the lore about our community survey has grown up through the
years and distorted our real intentions behind it. Actually, from the beginning
we had a clear vision of what we wanted to establish -- a biblically functioning
community. The scriptural elements of what constitutes a viable and biblical
church were nonnegotiable. The Bible -- not a door-to-door canvass -- should
determine how a community of believers operates.<p>

<p>

The purpose of the survey was merely to determine what particular sensitivities
existed in that community and to gather information that would help us meet the
particular spiritual needs of that area. For instance, were there a lot of
young couples with children in the vicinity? If so, that would influence the
kind of ministries we offered. Were there a lot of atheists and hard-core
unbelievers, or were most people Christians who had decided to stop attending
church for certain reasons? That information would be helpful in fine-tuning
the approach we would take in our services. Were people especially turned off
by appeals for money? Then maybe we should downplay the request for funds.<p>

<p>

Nobody should create a church based only on what people want. The blueprint
should come from the Bible, but it's legitimate to have some flexibility in the
methodology in order to reflect the particular needs of each community.<p>

<p>

Theologian Alister McGrath of Oxford University commented in his book
<i>Evangelicalism and the Future of Christianity</i> that "Willow Creek is an
excellent example of a church that has pioneered an approach that breaks down
incidental barriers [that keep seekers away from church]. . . . Yet the Gospel
is proclaimed effectively." He added that "there is no doubt that this church
and an increasing number of imitators throughout the Western world are getting
a hearing for the Gospel among those who would regard a traditional church
setting as a no-go zone."<p>


<p>

<p><br>

<p>
<font size=4><font
color="#23238e">
Isn't it inevitable that using modern art forms and language to communicate the
Gospel will subtly change its content?</font></font color><p>

<p>



We don't believe this is inevitable, but we are acutely aware of the potential
for this taking place. That's why we regularly bring together our best minds to
make sure we're not accidentally distorting the Gospel. Every service we
conduct is promptly evaluated by our elders, as a safeguard against
inadvertently straying from a responsible proclamation of the historical
Christian message.<p>

<p>

It's also important to keep in mind that art isn't used to teach at Willow
Creek. Its purpose is to pique curiosity, to evoke ideas, and to till the soil
of the soul so that the seed of God's Word can be planted there. Music, drama,
video, multimedia, and dance are only used as a prelude to a thirty- to
forty-minute message that then brings strong biblical clarity to the topic of
the day. It's this preaching of God's Word that ultimately has the power to
change lives. Art plays a secondary -- though important -- support role.<p>

<p>

In terms of using contemporary language, a distinction from theologian William
Hordern might be helpful. He stresses the difference between transforming and
translating the Gospel. Those who transform the Gospel are watering it down
into something it isn't, in order to make it more palatable to seekers. That's
totally unacceptable, and that's not what we're doing at Willow Creek.<p>

<p>

We're committed to keeping the Gospel intact while merely translating it into
words and images that our modern audience can understand. This has to be done
carefully so that the original meaning of the Scriptures is captured, but we
are convinced that it's essential to use contemporary communication in order to
help today's seekers grab ahold of biblical truths.<p>

<p>

The ironic downside of not translating the Gospel has been described by
evangelist Alan Walker: "An idolatry of words has grown up in evangelism. There
are people who, if they fail to hear the repetition of phrases and words with
which they are familiar, make the sometimes absurd claim that the Gospel is
not being preached."<p>


<p>

<p>
<br>
<p>

<p>
<font size=4><font
color="#23238e">
How big do you expect Willow Creek to grow? Why doesn't the church spin off
some satellite congregations instead of just continuing to expand?</font></font color><p>

<p>



From the beginning, we haven't discerned the Holy Spirit leading us to directly
plant other churches. Instead our ministry has been to work through the Willow
Creek Association to encourage church leaders around the world who have been
led by God to start new churches and overhaul stagnant ones. We've seen
numerous churches planted and rejuvenated as a result of our church leadership
conferences, and we've provided resources and other assistance to many of
them.<p>

<p>

Besides, we have seen some tremendous benefits to having a large church.
Because of our size, we're able to provide a wide-ranging inventory of
ministries to help seekers and believers alike, as well as to make an impact
for Christ in our local community.<p>

<p>

How large will Willow Creek grow? We don't know the answer to that. There are
1.5 million people living within a twenty-minute drive of our campus, and yet
we're only reaching one percent of them in a typical weekend service. So
there's certainly potential for growth!<p>

<br>
<p>

<p>

<p>

<font size=4><font
color="#23238e">Willow Creek has more than fifteen thousand in attendance on a weekend. Don't
some of your people--even your most involved and committed people--get lost in
that large crowd? What keeps Willow Creek from becoming an impersonal,
corporate entity, where folks feel as if they're only a part of a machine or an
elaborate program?</font color></font><p>

<p>



We believe that our new system of small groups will continue to make the church
small and personal to those who choose to get involved. With so many
opportunities to experience life change in the context of these groups, there's
no reason for anyone to get the feeling that Willow Creek is an impersonal
place.<p>

<p>

In addition, people are given the opportunity to be difference-makers in the
church by discovering their spiritual gifts and putting them into action in one
of our nearly one hundred different ministries. A by-product of this is an
increased sense of ownership of the church; people feel needed and appreciated
for the contribution they make.<p>

<p>

Also, the large weekend gatherings aren't the only place where teaching happens
at Willow Creek. We provide a variety of smaller settings where interactive
biblical teaching is offered on a wide range of life issues.<p>


<p>

<p><br>

<p>
<font size=4><font
color="#23238e">
Since Willow Creek was built on reaching baby boomers, what happens as that
generation ages?</font></font color><p>

<p>



Interestingly, a study conducted in the early 1990s shows that the median age
of Willow Creek attenders exactly matches the median age of the baby boom
generation. But as any waistline-expanding, hair-receding forty-something will
tell you, that generation is getting up in years. In fact, the leading edge of
the boomers will hit the age of fifty in 1996.<p>

As a result, in recent years Willow Creek began taking steps to continue
ministering to boomers while stepping up its efforts to reach the preceding and
following generations. In 1995 plans were being implemented to begin a weekly
service aimed at reaching the so-called baby busters, the generation following
the boomers. This group, also known as Generation X, has its own culture, its
own language, its own issues -- and its own desperate need for the Gospel. At the
same time, plans were afoot to create a new ministry to address the unique
needs of older members of our congregation.<p>

<p>

We're still trying to determine how these new ministries will play out. But
even if both baby busters and seniors end up with their own services each week,
the entire church will continue to get together at New Community for
vision-casting, expository preaching, communion, and just <i>being</i> the
church together. We believe it's biblical for all generations to gather on a
weekly basis as the body of Christ.<p>

What is Willow Creek's attitude toward major social and political issues, such
as abortion?</font></font color><p>

<p>



Our approach has been to teach unapologetically on social topics that the Bible
addresses, including racism, poverty, injustice, abortion, homosexuality,
pornography, the environment, and so on. Then we encourage our attenders to be
sensitive to the individual promptings of the Holy Spirit regarding their own
social and political involvement in these causes through appropriate
organizations.<p>

<p>

As a church, we've been scrupulous about staying out of partisan politics,
because there can be legitimate differences of opinion among Christians about
how certain biblical values can best be translated into political policies in a
pluralistic society.<p>

<p>

On a person-to-person level, Willow Creek has been heavily involved in social
issues. For instance, we have ministries designed to help women choose adoption
rather than abortion and have helped finance agencies that place unwanted
babies in Christian homes, and we've fought hunger and homelessness though our
Food Pantry and Community Care ministries.<p>

<p>

As a corporate body, however, we're committed to maintaining a tight focus on
what we feel we have been primarily called to do -- reach lost people with the
Gospel and help them mature in their faith. We're convinced that, ultimately, a
person's perspective on social issues won't fundamentally change until his or
her heart is transformed by Jesus Christ.<p>

<p>

As Chuck Colson writes in <i>Against the Night</i>, "In the absence of a deeper
conversion of perspective . . . minds are rarely changed on single policy
matters, no matter how persuasive our arguments."<p>

<p>

That "deeper conversion of perspective" comes when Jesus Christ works in a
person's life. That's why we believe that our greatest contribution to society
is through helping to bring irreligious people into an authentic relationship
with Him.<p>

LL week Bill had been looking forward to this moment. He was about to
fuck the daughter of the man who had fucked his wife. Lying in her bed, he
could hear Celestine humming in the bathroom as she prepared for him. <p>

It had been a long time since he'd been in a room so cold, with no heating.
After a while he ventured his arms over the covers, tore open a condom, and
laid it on a cardboard box that served as a bedside table. He was about to
prepare another, but didn't want to appear overoptimistic. One would achieve
his objective. He would clear out then. Already there had been too many delays.
The waltz, for instance, though it had made him giggle. Nevertheless, he had
told Madelaine, his pregnant wife, that he would be back by midnight. What
could Celestine be doing in there? There wasn't even a shower; and the wind cut
viciously through a broken window.<p>

His wife had met Celestine's father, Vincent Ertel, the French ex-Maoist
intellectual, in Paris. He had certainly impressed her. She had talked about
him continually, which was bad enough, and then rarely mentioned him, which, as
he understood now, was worse. <p>

Madelaine worked on a late-night TV discussion program. For two years she had
been eager to profile Vincent's progress from revolutionary to Catholic
reactionary. It was, she liked to inform Bill -- using a phrase that stayed in
his mind -- indicative of the age. Several times she went to see Vincent in
Paris; then she was invited to his country place near Auxerre. Finally she
brought him to London, to record the interview. When it was done, to celebrate,
she took him to Le Caprice for champagne, fish cakes, and chips.<p>

That night Bill had put aside the script he was directing and gone to bed early
with a ruler, a pencil, and <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>. Around the time that
Madelaine was becoming particularly enthusiastic about Vincent, Bill had made
up his mind not only to study the great books -- the densest and most
intransigent, the ones from which he'd always flinched  -- but to underline in
them, and even to memorize certain passages. The effort to concentrate was
torment, as his mind flew about. Yet most nights -- even during the period when
Madelaine was preparing for an encounter with Vincent -- he kept his light on
long after she had put hers out. Determined to swallow the thickest pills of
understanding, he would lie there muttering phrases he wanted to retain. One of
his favorites was Emerson's "We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of
that divine idea which each of us represents."<p>

One night Madelaine opened her eyes and said with a quizzical look, "Can't you
be easier on yourself?"<p>

Why? He wouldn't give up. He had read biology at university. Surely he couldn't
be such a fool as to find these books beyond him. His need for knowledge,
wisdom, nourishment, was greater than his need for sleep. How could a man have
come to the middle of his life with barely a clue about who he was or where he
might go? The heavy volumes represented the highest, surely, that man's thought
had flown; they had to include guidance.<p>

The close, leisurely contemplation afforded him some satisfaction -- usually
because the books started him thinking about other things. It was the part of
the day he preferred. He slept well, usually. But on the long night of the fish
cakes he awoke at four and felt for Madelaine across the bed. She wasn't there.
Shivering, he walked through the house until dawn, imagining she'd crashed the
car. After an hour he remembered that she hadn't taken it. Maybe she and
Vincent had gone on to a late-night place. She had never done anything like
this before. <p>

He could neither sleep nor go to work. He decided to sit at the kitchen table
until she returned, whenever it was. He was drinking brandy, and normally he
never drank before eight in the evening. If anyone offered him a drink before
this time, he claimed it was like saying good-bye to the whole day. In the
mid-eighties he'd gone to the gym in the early evening. For some days, though,
good-bye was surely the most suitable word. <p>

It was late afternoon before his wife returned, wearing the clothes she'd gone
out in, looking disheveled and uncertain. She couldn't meet his eye. He asked
her what she'd been doing. She said, "What do you think?" and went into the
shower.<p>

He considered several options, including punching her. But he fled the house
and made it to a pub. For the first time since he'd been a student, he sat
alone with nothing to do. He was expected nowhere. He had no newspaper with
him, and he liked papers; he could swallow the most banal or incredible thing
provided it was in newsprint. He watched the passing faces and thought how
pitiless the world was if you didn't have a safe place in it.<p>

He made himself consider how unrewarding it was to constrain people.
Infidelities would occur in most relationships. These days every man or woman
was a cuckold. And why not, when marriage was insufficient to satisfy most
human need? Madelaine had needed something and she had taken it. How bold and
stylish. How petty to blame someone for pursuing any kind of love!<p>

He was humiliated. The feeling increased over the weeks in a strange way. At
work or waiting for the tube, or having dinner with Madelaine (who had gained,
he could see, a bustling, dismissive intensity of will or concentration), he
found himself becoming angry with Vincent. For days on end he couldn't really
think of anything else, as if the man were inhabiting him.<p>

As he walked around Soho, where he worked, Bill entertained himself by thinking
of how someone might get even with a type like Vincent, were he so inclined.
The possibility was quite remote, but this didn't prevent him from imagining
scenarios from which he emerged with some satisfaction, if not credit. What
incentive, distraction, energy, and interest Vincent provided him with! This
was almost the only creative work he got to do now. <p>

<pre>
</pre>

<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/A-small.gif"
 align=left height=44 alt="A"></font> FEW days later he was presented with Celestine. <br>	She was sitting with a
man in a newly opened caf&eacute;, drinking cappuccino. Life was giving him a
chance. It was awful. He stood in the doorway, pretending to look for someone,
and considered whether he should take it. <p>

Vincent's eldest daughter lived in London. She wanted to be an actress, and
Bill had auditioned her for a commercial a couple of years earlier; he knew
that she'd obtained a small part in a film directed by an acquaintance of his.
On this basis he crossed the caf&eacute;, introduced himself, made the
pleasantest conversation he could, and was invited to sit down. The man turned
out to be a gay friend of hers. They all chatted. After some timorous
vacillation Bill asked Celestine in a cool tone whether she'd have a drink with
him in a couple of hours.<p>

He didn't go home but walked about. When he was tired, he sat in a pub with the
first volume of <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>. He had decided that if he
could read to the end of the book he would deserve a great deal of praise. He
did a little underlining, which since school he had considered a sign of
seriousness, but his mind wandered even more than usual until it was time to
meet her. <p>

To his delight Bill saw that some men glanced at Celestine when they could;
others openly stared. When she walked to the bar, they turned to examine her
legs. This would not have happened with Madelaine; only Vincent Ertel had taken
an interest in her. Later, as he and Celestine strolled up the street looking
for cabs, she agreed that he could come to her place at the end of the week.<p>

It was a triumphant few days of gratification anticipated. He would do more of
this. He had obviously been missing out on life's meaner pleasures. As
Madelaine walked about the flat, dressing, cooking, reading, searching for her
glasses, he could enjoy despising her. He informed his two closest friends that
the pleasures of revenge were considerable. He liked saying that the French
were used to being occupied. Now his pals were waiting to hear of his coup.<p>

Celestine flung her keys, wrapped in a tea towel, out a window. It was a hard
climb: her flat was at the top of a run-down five-story building in West
Kensington, an area of itinerants, bed-sits, and students. Coming into the
living room, he saw it had a view across a square. Wind and rain were sweeping
into cracked windows stuffed with newspaper. The walls were yellow, the carpet
brown and stained. The gas fire, which had several pairs of jeans suspended in
front of it on a clotheshorse, gave off an odor, and heated parts of the room
while leaving others cold.<p>

She persuaded him to remove his overcoat but not his scarf. Then she took him
into the tiny kitchen, which had bare floorboards; between an old sink and the
boiler there was hardly room for the two of them. <p>

"I will be having us some dinner." She pointed to two shopping bags. "Do you
like troot?"<p>

"Sorry?"<p>

It was trout. There were potatoes and green beans. After, they would have apple
strudel with cream. She had been to the shops and gone to some trouble. It
would take ages to prepare. He hadn't anticipated this. He left her there,
saying he would fetch drink.<p>

In the rain he went to the off-license and was paying for a bottle of wine when
he noticed through the window that a taxi had stopped at the traffic lights. He
ran out of the shop to hail the cab, but after he opened the door, he couldn't
go through with it. He collected the wine and carried it back.<p>

He waited in her living room, pacing and drinking. She didn't have a TV. Wintry
noises battered the window. Her place reminded him of rooms he'd shared as a
student. He was about to say to himself <i>Thank God I'll never have to live
like this again</i> when it occurred to him that if he left Madelaine, he
might, for a time, end up in some unfamiliar place, with stained, old, broken
fittings. How fastidious he had become! How had it happened? What other changes
had there been while he was looking in the other direction? <p>

He noticed a curled photograph tacked to the wall; it looked as though it had
been taken at the end of the sixties. Bill concluded that it was a picture of
the hopeful radical who'd fucked his wife. He had been a handsome man, and with
his pipe in his hand, hair below his ears, and an open-necked shirt, he had an
engaging look of self-confidence and raffish pleasure. Bill recalled the
slogans that had then decorated Paris: "Everything Is Possible." "Take Your
Desires for Realities." "It Is Forbidden to Forbid." He'd once used them in a
TV commercial. What optimism that generation had had! With his life given over
to literature, ideas, conversation, writing, and political commitment, ol'
Vincent must have had quite a time. He couldn't have been working constantly,
like Bill and his friends.<p>

The food was good. Bill leaned across the table to kiss Celestine. His lips
brushed her cheek. She turned her head and looked out across the dark square to
the lights beyond, as if trying to locate something.<p>

He talked about the film industry and what the actors, directors, and producers
of the movies were really like. Not that he knew them personally, but they were
gossiped about by other actors and technicians. She asked questions and laughed
easily. <p>

Things should have been moving along. He had to get up at 5:30 to direct a
commercial for a bank. He was becoming known for such well-paid but journeyman
work. Now that Madelaine was pregnant, he would have to do more of it. It would
be a struggle to find the time for the screenwriting he wanted to do. It was
dawning on him that if he was to do anything worthwhile at his age, he would
have to be serious in a new way. And yet, when he considered his ambitions,
which he no longer mentioned to anyone -- to travel overland to Indonesia while
reading Proust . . . and other, more "internal" things -- he felt a surge of
shame, as if it were immature and obscene to harbor such hopes; as if, in some
ways, it was already too late.<p>

He shuffled his chair around the table until he and Celestine were sitting side
by side. He attempted another kiss.<p>

She stood up and offered him her hands. "Shall we dance?"<p>

He looked at her in surprise. "Dance?"<p>

"It will 'ot you up. Don't you . . . dance?"<p>

"Not really." <p>

"Why?"<p>

"Why? We always danced like this." He shut his eyes and nodded his head as if
attempting to bang in a nail with his forehead.<p>

She kicked off her shoes. "We danced like this," she said. "I'll illustrate
you." She looked at him. "Take it off."<p>

"What?"<p>

"This stupid thing."<p>

She pulled off his scarf. She shoved the chairs against the wall and put on a
Chopin waltz, took his hand, and placed her other hand on his back. He looked
down at her dancing feet even as he trod on them, but she didn't object. Gently
but firmly she turned and turned him across the room, until he was dizzy, her
hair tickling his face. Whenever he glanced up, she was looking into his eyes.
Each time they crossed the room, she trotted back, pulling him, never unamused.
She seemed determined that he should learn, certain that this would benefit
him.<p>

"You require some practice," she said at last. He fell back into his chair,
blowing and laughing. "But after a week, who knows, we could get you work as a
gigolo!" <p>

<pre>
</pre>

<font size=+2> <img src="../../../dropcaps/I-small.gif"
 align=left height=44 alt="I"></font>	T was midnight. Celestine came naked out of the bathroom, smoking a
cigarette. She got into the bed and lay beside him. He thought of a time in New
York when the company had sent a white limousine to the airport. Drinking
whiskey and watching TV as the limo passed over the East River toward
Manhattan, he wanted nothing more than for his friends to see him.<p>

She was on him vigorously, and the earth was moving: either that, or the two
single beds, on the juncture of which he was lying, were separating. He stuck
out his arms to secure them, but with each lurch his head was being forced down
into the fissure. He felt as if his ears were going to be torn off. The two of
them were about to crash through to the floor.<p>

He rolled her over onto one bed. Then he sat up and showed her what would have
happened. She started to laugh; she couldn't stop.<p>

The gas meter ticked. She was dozing. He had never lain beside a lovelier face.
He thought of what Madelaine might have sought that night with Celestine's
father -- affection, attention, serious talk, honesty, distraction. Did he, Bill,
give her that now? Could they give it to each other? With a kid on the way?<p>

Celestine was nudging him and trying to say something in his ear.<p>

"You want what?" he said. "Surely . . . no . . . no." <p>

"Bill, yes."<p>

He liked to think he was willing to try anything. A black eye would certainly
send a convincing message to her father. She smiled when he raised his hand.<p>

"I deserve to be hurt."<p>

"No one deserves that."<p>

"But you see . . . I do."<p>

That night, in that freezing room, he praised her beauty and her intelligence;
he did everything she asked, for as long as she wanted -- he had never kissed
anyone for so long -- until he forgot where he was, or who they both were, until
there was nothing that they wanted, and only the most satisfactory peace.<p>

He got up and dressed. He was shivering. He wanted to wash -- he smelled of
her -- but he wasn't prepared for a cold bath. <p>

"Why are you leaving?" She leaped up and held him. "Stay, stay -- I haven't
finished with you yet."<p>

He put on his coat and went into the living room. Without looking back he
hurried out and down the stairs. He pulled the knob of the front door,
anticipating the fresh, damp night air. But the door held. He had forgotten:
the door was locked. He stood there.<p>

Upstairs she was wrapped in a fur coat, looking down the stairwell.<p>

"The key," he said.<p>

"Old man," she said, laughing. "You are."<p>

She came barefoot down the stairs. While she unlocked the door, he mumbled,
"Will you tell your father I saw you?"<p>

"But why?"<p>

He touched her face. She drew back. "You should put something on that," he
said. "I met him once. He knows my wife."<p>

"I rarely see him now," she said.<p>

She was holding out her arms. They danced a few steps across the hall. He was
better at it now. He went out into the street. Several cabs passed him, but he
didn't hail them. He kept walking. The rain was comforting. He put his head
back and looked up into the sky. He had some impression that happiness was
beyond him and everything was coming down, and that life could not be grasped
but only lived.

	<font size=5>A</font>ll nations feel superior to others in certain respects, but they can easily be
beset by doubts, anxieties, and even inferiority complexes. France, to judge by
her press and by the discussions in the market place, oscillates between vanity
and a sense of humiliation, being as ready to accuse foreigners of barbarism as
to admit Germany's irresistible superiority in everything but the art de
vivre--which is to say, in essentials.<p>

<p>

Not long ago I reread <i>La France Nouvelle</i> of Prevost-Paradol, a book written
by a Liberal on the eve of the Franco-Prussian War and in the presentiment of
defeat. "When the present head of our country," wrote Prevost-Paradol,
referring to Napoleon III, "said that a country's rank depends on the number of
men it can place under arms, he did nothing but give a too absolute expression
to a correct idea, for one must take into account the relative quality of men
as well as their numbers. Xerxes, for example, placed many more men under arms
than Greece, and yet the great soul of Greece vanquished him. But when it is a
question of equally civilized nations and of courageous citizens, equally
imbued with feelings of honor, this maxim becomes rigorously true, and it is to
the most populous nation that military and political ascendancy inevitably
belong with all the material and moral advantages accruing from them."<p>

<p>

Prevost-Paradol was here forecasting what a century later every Frenchman
learns at school: France lost her position in Europe first and foremost because
her population throughout the nineteenth century increased less than that of
her neighbors and rivals. True, the post-war rise in the French birth rate has
rekindled hopes which would have seemed Utopian twenty years ago. But the
French economic revival today appears relatively insignificant when compared to
that of small countries like Sweden or Switzerland or to this century's giant,
the United States.<p>

<p>

The French were disillusioned with the economic condition of their country the
day they abandoned the fiction of a healthy equilibrium. As long as the
maintenance of a certain just proportion between industry and agriculture, town
and country, large and small business seemed to obey an unwritten law of French
collective life and the requirements of order and measure, we were content to
sit back and contemplate, without a sense of bitterness or inferiority, the
steady growth of English or American cities, the preference given by the
peoples of the West to industrial work, the multiplication of huge factories.
That so many traditional forms still survived in France, that our small
enterprises continued to function on a personal scale, and that we were blessed
with millions of peasants, masters by divine right of their own land--these
facts all seemed proof of wisdom; we avoided the ravages of crises, massive
unemployment, the grim lot of the work slaves of the suburbs.<p>

<p>

But as soon as the now hackneyed theory of economic growth was applied to
France, these illusions were shattered. As soon as it was realized that the
relative importance of industry and of trade, transport, and services depends
not on the genius of nations but on the maturity of their economy, France was
found to be more backward than Sweden or Switzerland; indeed, she seemed almost
as backward as China and India (whose civilizations in the past had been second
to none).<p>

<p>

This criticism or self-criticism of the French economy still haunts books,
reports, articles, and lectures. It can be found in the publications of the
Economic Commission for Europe, and in the periodic reports of the Commission
du Bilan National. Herbert Luethy has translated it into German, while
Jean-Paul Sartre has adopted it in order to interpret, in a pseudo-Marxist
manner, the hesitations of the proletarian revolt. Let us briefly examine its
principal points.<p>

<p>

In 1900 the percentage of industrial manpower, relative to the number of
persons between 15 and 59 years of age (25 per cent), was higher in France than
it was in Germany, Holland, Denmark, Norway, or Sweden. But for the next half
century it failed to rise, and today the figure is lower than that of all the
other countries of Western Europe with the exception of Holland. Similarly, the
percentage of those employed in agriculture, relative to the male population
aged from 15 to 59, is higher in France than for all the other countries of
Western Europe, higher even than for Denmark and Holland, both of which are
exporters of agricultural products. (It was 48 per cent in 1900 and 32 per cent
in 1950.) If the distribution of manpower over the three economic sectors
(mining, agriculture, and fishing; manufacture; trade and transport) is one of
the most accurate criteria of the stage reached by a modern society, then the
conclusion is undeniable: a century ago, when Prevost-Paradol was writing,
France was still the most highly industrialized country on the continent; today
she leads Southern Europe but trails behind Northern Europe.<p>

<p>

The active male population employed in French agriculture fell from 5.6 million
in 1901 to 3.3 million in 1954. What was denounced, thirty years ago, as the
"depopulation of the countryside" was not a myth. In half a century, more than
2 million Frenchmen have sought nonagricultural employment. French industry,
between 1921 and 1954, only absorbed 600,000 of them, whereas trade, transport,
and services took close to a million. In short, French industrial manpower has
barely advanced in the last thirty years, those workers not needed in
agriculture going mostly into shopkeeping, transportation, and white-collar
work.<p>

<p>

French failure to industrialize aggressively has been accompanied by an
insufficient concentration of the means of production; one might almost say by
a paralysis of capital. Concentration has made but slight progress since the
turn of the century. Enterprises employing more than twenty workers represented
4 per cent of the total in 1906 and 8.5 per cent in 1950. Enterprises employing
more than ten represented 7 per cent of the total in 1906 and 15 per cent in
1950.<p>

<p>

Likewise the disparity in the size of our agricultural units has been a classic
theme for instructive reflection and morose meditation: 40 per cent of French
farms, or one million, were calculated in 1950 to have a gross income of less
than 300,000 francs (about 860 dollars). An economy hovering somewhere between
the Middle Ages and the twentieth century: such is the pessimistic image which
the French have substituted in their national consciousness for the idea of a
harmonious balance.<p>

<p>

The diversity of small businesses and the wide range in their efficiency have
constituted the main element in French self-criticism, as it has been developed
by public officials and economics professors. Other favorite targets have been
the state's subsidization of surplus products (wine, for example) and the
billions of francs spent every year maintaining the alcohol monopoly, which
afford an ideal opportunity for denouncing conservative dirigisme or the
indecent activity of pressure groups. The high cost of construction and the
dispersion of building workers over tens of thousands of small enterprises also
illustrate the statistics of feeble productivity.<p>

<p>

These criticisms of the French economy usually take on a political coloration.
Left-wing critics emphasize that French businessmen are irresponsible,
authoritarian, enslaved by bourgeois traditions, indifferent to questions of
productivity, anxious to obtain the protection of the state. Right-wing
commentators single out the evils of inflation, the disorder of public
finances, the sudden introduction of the forty-hour week, the incoherent
intervention of the state. Each side denounces the "Malthusianism" of the
other.<p>

<p>

In times past, the French used to pride themselves on their wisdom in
maintaining a balance between industry and agriculture. But today, we are
naturally dismayed because our badly equipped farms, our grimy little shops,
and our unproductive artisans have not disappeared.<p>

<p>

How do the French themselves explain the survival of so many inefficient
enterprises? How do they account for the fact that manpower employed in
manufacturing industries has not multiplied as fast as that employed in
shopkeeping, transport, and white-collar work?<p>

<p>

A geographical explanation has been put forward by the French historian,
Charles Moraze. Nature, which favored France in the past, has handicapped her
in an age of technical civilization. France was a rich country as long as
wealth was linked to the land, as long as multiple-crop farming was rational,
as long as the diversity of her soils and climates could assure both abundance
and differentiation. But in an age when the scientific cultivation of cereals
can provide at one and the same time for the feeding of the population, the
reduction of agricultural manpower, and the use of those thus freed for more
productive employment, then France is poor in relation to more highly
industrialized countries.<p>

<p>

Moraze emphasizes two other particular difficulties which industrialization in
France has run into. The mountainous nature of the Massif Central proved an
obstacle when the French railway network was laid down in the nineteenth
century. Furthermore, between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the
location of industry altered more radically in France than in any other country
in Europe. The coal deposits of the Massif Central disappointed the hopes of
the prospectors, with the result that the small-scale industries of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, which made France the foremost industrial
country on the continent in 1850, constituted a brake on later developments.<p>

<p>

This explanation dissipates the legend, still widely spread abroad, of "the
natural wealth of France." The coal deposits of the Ruhr or of Wales
represented in the last century a more authentic source of wealth--or, let us
say, a greater incentive to the creation of new wealth--than the sun of the
Cote d'Azur, the rolling hills of Burgundy, or even the plains of the Brie or
the Beauce. France was short of coal during the century in which this was an
indispensable condition for heavy industry, and the diversity of her provinces
and agriculture offered her strong reasons for not specializing.<p>

<p>

An explanation of greater currency today is the demographic theory which Alfred
Sauvy, in particular, has elaborated and confirmed with examples and analyses.
The non-increase of a country's population, according to this theory, should
permit curtailment of what can be called "demographic investments"--that is to
say, the extra funds needed to train a growing number of young men. The pre-war
stagnation in the French birth rate acted as a brake to industrial expansion
for mechanical and psychological reasons.<p>

<p>

Economic progress presupposes rapid modifications in the relative importance of
different sectors of the economy. Now transfers of labor from one sector to
another are above all effected through the opening up of new jobs on the labor
market. Instead of taking the place of the retiring older worker, the young
worker heads for those industries which are expanding. It is far more difficult
to get mature workers to give up jobs they are used to in order to take up new
and unfamiliar ones in a different trade. With a rising birth rate, the
increase in the number of workers tends to increase labor mobility, whereas a
static or shrinking population tends to reduce it.<p>

<p>

At the same time it is precisely a stagnant population which most needs a high
mobility of labor. When the home market is expanding, thanks to the arrival of
new consumers, the relative positions of various industries can be modified
without any of them having to contract. But when the number of consumers is not
rising and the home market can only benefit from a rise in the living standard,
the growth of certain industries must be paid for by the contraction of
others.<p>

<p>

The feeble rate of industrialization, combined with a strong propensity to save
(itself determined by both the distribution of income and the spontaneous
inclinations of the French), created a surplus of capital, which for the most
part was invested abroad. (French investments in foreign countries amounted to
some 40 billion Napoleonic francs on the eve of World War I.) It would have
been more in the national interest to invest within France herself--in her
industry or agriculture--the francs that went into building Russian railways or
the port of Gdynia in Poland.<p>

<p>

The effect of demographic stagnation is, above all, psychological. Why increase
the size of one's business if there are only one or two sons to take over the
succession? The absence of young people engenders a fear of excessive
production and of inadequate outlets. One lives under the tyranny of the
present, viewing the future at best as a matter of holding on to what already
is, whereas the law of modern economic life is growth.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

In the course of this century the French state has retarded economic expansion
both by what it has done and by what it has omitted doing, thanks to the false
notions or ignorance of those who were governing the country. If constant
causes, such as geography, the stagnation of the population, the psychology of
managers and workers, had been entirely responsible for the economic slump,
then they should have operated as much from 1920 to 1930 as from 1930 to 1940.
Instead, the national income index dropped in 1937-1938 to 86 (assuming
1928-1929 equals 100). Economic growth in Europe was slow between the wars, but
it was regular. Nothing need have prevented the French economy, such as it was,
with its strengths and weaknesses, from continuing its development. The crisis,
which struck all the countries of Europe, was prolonged, aggravated by major
mistakes of policy and above all by the refusal of all French governments,
whether of the Right or of the Left, to devaluate between 1933 and 1936. When
the barriers were finally swept away, the forty-hour week was introduced, as
though such a measure could help to absorb an unemployment which was not
widespread anyway.<p>

<p>

There is additional evidence that the economic policies of the state have been
at fault. Economic progress normally involves an increase in the share of wages
and salaries in the national income and a reduction in the share of mixed
incomes. Such was the case in France at the end of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries. The share of mixed revenues--that is, of producers who
are both employers and employed, single or family enterprises--fell from 53 per
cent in 1788 to 28 per cent in 1890, while the share of wages rose over the
same period from 16 per cent to 52 per cent. At the same time that of capital
declined from 31 per cent to 18 per cent. But in 1952 the proportion of mixed
revenues rose again to 32 per cent, that of wages declined to 49 per cent, and
that of social transfers (social security, health insurance, family
allocations, pensions, and so forth) rose to 14.3 per cent. As for the share of
capital, it had shrunk to a level of 4.6 per cent. These changes are not
explained by the spontaneous movement of the economy; they are due to the
intervention of the state.<p>

<p>

The state enacted legislation which reoriented an important fraction of wages
and salaries through the coffers of the social insurance system. The inflation
which has persisted almost ceaselessly since 1914 provoked the collapse of
stock-market holdings and gave a new lease on life to mixed revenue producers,
like small entrepreneurs, artisans, and shopkeepers. The French tax system has
not been neutral; it has not tended to place big and small on the same level,
where the fittest naturally survive; it has aided the small and has shielded
them from the rigors of natural selection.<p>

<p>

State policy, however, is not a final cause, and it requires explanation as
much as it provides one. On the one hand, the state's conservative
direction--tariff protection, subsidies for unsalable products, benefits for
inefficient producers--attests its own weakness and the influence of private
corporations; on the other hand, it also expresses a widespread state of mind.
Let us once again take the example of the crisis of 1929. Why were the
successive French governments, of both the Right and Left, incapable of taking
the relatively simple measures which would have put an end to this absurdly
ruinous crisis? The governments of other countries also committed errors and
prolonged the Depression. But in France the errors committed went from one
extreme to the other, with the country settling down to a regular state of
subproduction. Was this due to the economic ignorance of French leaders?
Without a doubt. Was it due to a rebirth of a latent peasant and craftsman's
mistrust toward the cities, industry, and capitalism? Without a doubt, also.
German or American unemployment seemed to justify the skepticism which the
French of the provinces had always felt toward the indefinite expansion of
production and purchasing power, the miracles of science and technology. Until
very recently the French did not possess a system of education, nor a scale of
values, in keeping with the needs of industrial civilization.<p>

<p>

Even so the French have played an important part in the development of new
industries, automobiles, and airplanes. They have not turned their backs
categorically on technical civilization. What has been particularly marked in
France has been the fact that new industries have risen up alongside of the
old.<p>

<p>

Since 1945, in spite of inflation, strikes, and an apparent disorder, France
has been in a period of renovation. Since 1953 the rate of expansion has been
normal; that is, it has matched the growth of economically advanced countries.
It has been of the order of 5 to 6 per cent for the national product, 10 per
cent for industry. Never have the French talked so much about stagnation as
they have since their economy began to expand.<p>

<p>

In such conditions the turbulence of the next few years is inevitable. The
immediate difficulties--the standard of living, the value of the franc, the
problems posed by the transformation of existing economic structures,
agricultural surpluses, the modernization of backward sectors and regions, and
the repercussions of the events of North Africa--will all combine in
unpredictable fashion in the French parliament and in the country. The regime
will be, or will appear to be, menaced; men, parties, classes will exchange
invectives and brandish ideologies in the familiar style of French tumult. But
if the transformation of North Africa into independent states can despite
everything be accomplished, without irreparable damage being done on one or the
other side of the Mediterranean--then the internal uproar, the cries of the
Poujadistes and their successors, the vain Stalinism of a fossilized Communist
Party, and the bitterness provoked by the loss of the Empire will not keep
France from advancing, in her own peculiar way, along the common road of the
peoples of the old continent of Europe.

<blockquote>



<font size=5>S</font>TUDENTS of contemporary civilization may find an analysis

of modern Germany a particularly fruitful and rewarding study. Nowhere will

they discover the

forces which contend for mastery in a modern state more clearly defined or the

moral impotence of modern industrial civilization more obviously revealed. The

moral limitations of modern life, which in other nations, and particularly in

America, are obscured by a tremendous wealth the production of which is almost

the sole achievement of modern industrialism, are vividly delineated in this

unhappy nation, which the war and the war's aftermath have robbed of the only

blessings which modern civilization knows how to bestow. The poverty of Germany

aggravates every vice and defines every weakness which she possesses in common

with other Western nations. The German temper serves to outline the resulting

picture even more sharply, for it is inclined to philosophy rather than to

politics and is gifted and cursed at once with the virtue and the vice of

consistency. In other nations, and particularly in England, a penchant for

compromise serves to soften the asperities of class-and race-conflicts. In

Germany, however, the various economic and political groups contend for their

rights and support their prejudices with a vigor and venom which make ordered

government well-nigh impossible, but which offer the interested observer a very

clear picture of the vital factors and forces in a modern industrial state.<p>





The political situation in Germany reveals a triangular conflict between three

economic and political groups, none of which is powerful enough to gain

permanent ascendancy in the nation. These groups may be roughly designated as

the Nationalists, the Industrialists, and the Socialists. Each group has a

quarrel with the other two, but also some affinity of interest or inclination

with the second against the third. Thus Nationalists and Socialists are

idealists of a sort who do not understand each other but both abhor the realism

of the Industrialists. Industrialists and Socialists unite in supporting

policies of European conciliation against Nationalist dreams of vengeance.

Nationalists and Industrialists are combined to oppose the collectivist

economics of the laborers. So the political life of the nation is fretted with

endless conspiracies between the groups, in none of which a clear and

victorious principle emerges to save the nation from endless conflict.<p>



The Nationalists represent the old traditional Germany which hewed a place for

itself in Europe by military power. They exhibit all the vices and virtues of

the kind of patriotism which fashioned the modern nation out of the wreck of

the Roman and the mediaeval empires. In them the traditional patriot is the

more clearly typified because he is slightly caricatured. They imagine

themselves cold-blooded Realpolitiker who deal ruthlessly with the hard facts

of Machtpolitik. As a matter of fact they are naive romanticists whose

sentimental attachment to the nation places them in opposition to the

internationalism of "big business" as much as to the internationalism of the

workers. Their patriotism is hopelessly anachronistic in the new Europe of

economic interdependence. It is compounded of the narrow loyalties of the

traditional European peasant and the robustious conceptions of national honor

of the landed aristocrat. Living close to the soil, these classes do not

understand the political needs of the great industrial centres which have

developed in Europe in the past century; and from the vantage point of their

agrarian prosperity they are able to defy these needs with impunity. The

Nationalists naturally abhor all the political and economic arrangements which

under the name of the "Dawes Plan" are for the time being preserving peace in

Europe, at the price, of course, of the political and economic servitude of

Germany. Momentarily in power at the head of a coalition, they refrain from

doing violence to these arrangements only because the Industrialists, whose

support they need, are committed to them. Naturally the Nationalists are

monarchists. They have convinced themselves that the revolution was the cause

and not the consequence of the defeat in 1918; by incessant reiteration they

have raised the idea of a Socialist "stab in the back" to a political dogma.<p>





A noisy right wing of the monarchists detached itself from the party some time

ago under the leadership of Hitler and Ludendorff, but was fortunately reduced

to impotence in the last election. These extremists have discovered an easy way

of cursing the Industrialists and Socialists in the same breath by ascribing

their pacific tendencies to a Jewish want of patriotism and to Semitic

conspiracies against the State. The basis in fact for their curious and violent

anti-Semitism is the undoubtedly strong Jewish influence in the ranks of both

capitalists and Socialists. The Kaiser is persona non grata among them because

he is believed to have been a vital factor in the industrialization of

Germany.<p>



<font size=4><b>II</b></font>

<p>





<font size=5>T</font>HE Industrialists are politically articulate in the

Volkspartei, of which

Stresemann is the acknowledged leader. Under his leadership this party

initiated those policies of Erfullung which finally resulted in the acceptance

of the Dawes Plan. The Industrialists are the real Realpolitiker of modern

Germany. Bereft of any sentimental attachment to either the nation or the

ideals of peace, they follow the political course which their interests

dictate. They are the perfect representatives of the secular spirit of modern

industrialism. For the past few years they have pursued a policy of European

conciliation, for they feared that the truculence of the Nationalists would

only play into the hands of French militarism. Knowing that behind French

chauvinism was the desire of French iron to gain control of German coal, they

followed the course of saving the title to their resources by acceding to even

the most exorbitant demands of French militarism--as, for instance, in the

Micum agreement. Meanwhile they have tried to place the chief burden of

Reparations on the backs of the workers, and have succeeded in destroying some

of the most dearly bought advantages of Labor. Their conciliatory policies have

had the active support of the Democrats and Centrists, who have a real interest

in European pacification, and the passive support of the Socialists, who were

ready to pay any price that war might be averted. Now that the Dawes Plan is a

fairly secure working arrangement, the Industrialists are inclined to part

company with their liberal and radical supporters, and they have in fact

entered the Nationalist government. More or less monarchist at heart, they have

supported republican parties only because the monarchists were hopelessly

involved with the idea of a war of revenge. Now that there is no immediate

danger of such a war, the Industrialists are inclined to exploit the

Nationalist temper for the purpose of securing better trade-agreements with

France.<p>



It may be imagined that the path of the Labor Party in such a situation has not

been an easy one. The conflict in the industrial community had to be abandoned

in order to defeat Nationalist policies which were perilous to industrial

employers and employees alike. The workers accomplished this purpose by

maintaining an anxious neutrality toward the governments dominated by the

Industrialists. Naturally this policy exposed them to the suspicion of

connivance with the enemies of Labor--a suspicion which the Communists

assiduously exploited, so that it seemed for a time as if the Communists might

capture the trade-unions. In the last election the Socialists have, however,

regained their lost strength and practically eliminated the threat of a

Communist uprising. While the Socialists are not so uncompromising as the

Communists in their class-war doctrines, they are more orthodox Marxians than

British Labor; needless to say they are, as all Continental Socialists,

thoroughly internationalist in their outlook. Practically ostracized from the

cultural unity of the nation and denied access to the real treasures of their

various national civilizations, Continental workers have been driven to develop

class loyalties in compensation for and in opposition to the traditional

national communities. The internationalism of the German workers drives the old

patriots into veritable frenzies of righteous indignation, but they fail to see

anything more significant in the revolt of the helots than evidences of Semitic

conspiracies against the integrity of Germany.<p>



Both the extreme nationalists and the internationalists dream of a day when

order will be brought out of the chaos of conflicting loyalties by the forceful

elimination of either the class or the nation as the object of general fealty.

The dreams of neither are likely to be realized. Modern industrial nationalism

is too arrantly secular in its aim, and the old traditional nationalism is too

blind to the inequalities of class, to be able to regain the confidence of the

worker in Europe. The industrial worker of the Continent is probably

permanently alienated from the nation; but his dreams of destroying it by means

of the class conflict are no more likely to be fulfilled than the dreams of the

patriot. What happened in Russia will hardly be duplicated in any advanced

industrial community in which the economic organization creates a much larger

middle class than the Marxian prophecies contemplated and where the peasants

are not so readily reduced to the ranks of the proletariat as Marxism assumes.

Here the evidence from contemporary German history is significant and

illuminating. If Communism could capture a nation it would have conquered

Germany in the winter of her discontent, when poverty drove the workers to

despair and forced many members of the middle classes into their ranks. Even

under such conditions the forces of revolution could not succeed, though they

were actively supported from Moscow. The German workers knew that a revolt of

the Left would be as disastrous to them as a military coup of the Right.<p>





<font size=4><b>III</font></b>

<p>



<font size=5>I</font>T seems, in short, that European civilization is destined

to be harassed for

years to come by a conflict between political and economic groups in which each

group lacks the power to reduce the others to impotence and thus fashion a

homogeneous civilization. This conflict does not appear so clearly in other

European nations as in Germany, but it is nevertheless a common characteristic

of European life. Since no group is strong enough to build a new order by

force, one might hope that the community as such might fashion ideals and

conceive principles which would transcend and finally compose the fruitless

conflict. But there is no evidence, particularly in German life, that such a

hope may be realized in any immediate future.<p>



Two small political parties of Germany, the Democrats and the Centrists

(Catholics), typify in a sense the political forces which are not immediately

dominated by the political and economic interests of the three great groups.

The Democrats, among whom Jewish intellectuals are conspicuous, represent the

professional middle classes and intellectual idealists of various classes. They

are sincere republicans and passionate devotees of the ideal of European peace.

In domestic politics they exhibit tendencies closely akin to those of British

liberalism, and are probably too involved with the individualistic ideals of

the nineteenth century to play a determining role in a country in which

tradition supports the modern tendency to collectivist economic theories.<p>



The Catholic Party is the only political group in Germany which really

transcends the class conflict. Claiming support of individuals in all economic

groups, who are united in it by religious sentiment and ecclesiastic

discipline, the Party has followed a political course which has been of

inestimable value in preserving parliamentary government in a time when the

violence of the class conflict threatened to destroy it. Of all non-Labor

groups it has been most sympathetic to Labor. That is why governments which

needed the benevolent neutrality of Labor have usually been headed by a

Catholic chancellor though they were dominated by the Volkspartei. The Party

has been vigorously republican, probably because it had no special love for the

Protestant Hohenzollern dynasty. In its international policies it has worked as

sincerely as the Democrats for European pacification. Its international outlook

may be prompted by its international ecclesiastical connections, but there are

other Catholic parties in Europe which are violently nationalist. More likely

the explanation for its internationalism must be found in the traditions of the

Holy Roman Empire, which, unlike the modern German empire, was not a

nationalist state.<p>





Though it could not be maintained that these two parties represent the only

expressions of political idealism in the state or that their idealism is

untainted by class interest, they are nevertheless, both in their strength and

in their weakness, fairly symbolical of the position of intellectual and

religious idealism in the modern state. If the Democratic Party may be regarded

as representing intellectual idealism, it is significant that it is able to

transcend national prejudices partly because of the Semitic genius for

internationalism. That is a circumstance which is not lost on the Nationalist

opponents. If the Catholic Party represents religious idealism, it is

significant that medieval and not modern religion grapples with the social

problems of modern civilization. In other words the typical citizen of the

modern industrial state, who is more liable to be Gentile than Jew and

Protestant than Catholic, lacks both the imagination and the spiritual passion

to detach himself from the prejudices of his political or economic group or to

act contrary to its immediate interests; nor is he seriously impressed by the

counsels of races and religions which are not altogether indigenous to his own

civilization. He discounts the virtue of their position because he suspects it

of being conceived in opposition to his own civilization. The internationalism

of both Jews and Catholics aggravates his own nationalism, because he believes

that it is a form of vengeance against his refusal to accept them as fully

accredited members of his society.<p>





<font size=4><b>IV</b></font>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE situation in Germany is of course only roughly typical

of Western life as a

whole. The position of the Jewish internationalist is more typical than that of

the Catholic internationalist, for the Catholic Party of Germany is unique

rather than typical. But in the inability of Protestantism seriously to

influence the economic and social life of the nation or to make the inspiration

of a spiritual interpretation of life available for the problems of social

life, Germany is typical. The complete secularization of her life is typical.

The modern mind has been obsessed with the task of conquering nature and

completely lacks the imaginative faculty which is needed to develop the art of

living together. The highest intelligence of modern life, which should have

been devoted to the task of emancipating man from ancient hatreds and political

frictions has been used to aggravate those hatreds by building up an

industrialism which has added horizontal to the already existing vertical

divisions of human society. European civilization is perishing in its

fratricidal conflicts, with no arm strong enough to coerce it into some

semblance of unity and no heart warm enough to win it to the ideals of

brotherhood. Men are so imperfect that mutual love can be built only upon a

mutual trust which assumes virtue in the neighbor and thus helps to create it;

in their imperfections they are bound to wrong each other so much that the art

of living together must finally depend upon the grace of forgiveness. A love

which is based upon trust and which can issue in forgiveness requires a high

degree of spiritual passion and imagination. The current religions of Western

civilization are supplying neither the passion nor the imagination. They are

too immersed in the problems of the inner life to concern themselves seriously

with the needs of society, too infected with the secularism of the day to

generate sufficient spiritual passion for the social task, and too involved

with national and middle-class groups to gain a proper perspective of the needs

of modern society as a whole.<p>





It is significant that any realistic and necessarily pessimistic analysis of

modern life is generally resented and little understood in America. We accept

it either with incredulity or with pharisaic detachment. Whatever may be the

matter with Europe, we do not feel that anything is seriously the matter with

us. We do not realize that the forces which are so vividly outlined in Germany

and other European nations are contending for mastery in our life as well as

theirs, and that we possess no spiritual grace which they may lack. Our

geographic isolation and economic opulence will save us for a while from

sharing the fate of European civilization. We thus have time to fashion morally

redemptive forces for modern life. But there is no evidence in our life that

encourages us to hope that we will improve the time.<p>



The race prejudices which we exhibit, particularly in our relations to Asia,

and the unimaginative and timid attitude which we assume toward impoverished

Europe, in which the fears of a political novice and the anxiety of a wealthy

creditor are mingled, do not offer much hope for the future. The very fact that

the sins of modern civilization which we share with Europe are more covert here

than there only serves to add the sin of blatant self-righteousness to the

other moral deficiencies of modern society. Europe may stumble to her doom in

confusion while we walk into ours with pride erect; but nothing can finally

save our Western civilization either in Europe or in America if we do not add

to the achievement of the conquest of nature the moral achievement of a social

order in which men may live together in peace in spite of the conflict of their

interests, and in which men will learn to trust one another in spite of wrong

which they have inflicted upon each other.

	<h4>Government</h4>

	

			<img src="./Gov.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>



	Money laundering--the use of financial transactions to hide illegal 

profits, such as drug money--could become more difficult this month; 

new regulations governing record-keeping by financial institutions may 

take effect as early as April <B>1</B>. Written by the Treasury Department 

and the Federal Reserve Board, the rules require institutions to collect 

and keep for five years information about electronic transfers of $3,000 

or more--thus applying a scrutiny similar to that already given to 

cash transactions. Each business day more than $2 trillion worldwide is 

moved electronically. <B>15</B>, the deadline for filing tax returns. This 

year taxpayers may make use of two innovations. Single taxpayers who meet 

income and other qualifications may file wholly by telephone; and all 

taxpayers (except, for security reasons, those now filing by phone) may 

opt to have refunds paid by direct deposit (previously only those filing 

by personal computer could do so).<p>

	

	<br clear=all>

	

	<h4>Q &amp; A</h4>



			<img src="./q&a.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

	

	<I>Why do the time zones in the United States zigzag, instead of following 

the meridians in straight lines?<p>

</I>Time zones were introduced in the United States in 1883 at the 

instigation of railway owners, who were frustrated by the scheduling 

problems created because stations across the country observed some 100 

different local times, determined by the location of the sun overhead. 

"Railroad Time"divided the country into zones based on meridians 15 

degrees apart and then adjusted to accommodate such factors as the 

locations of train stations and of the ends of railway lines. In 1918 the 

government redrew the boundaries to avoid dividing densely populated areas 

and to keep proximate commercial centers in the same zone; it paid more 

heed to the requests of cities and states than to the convenience of 

railroads. There have been dozens of boundary changes since. In most cases 

the lines have been moved westward, reflecting the East's traditional 

predominance in commerce and communities' consequent desire to be part of 

or closer to the Eastern time zone. For example, the line separating the 

Eastern and Central time zones originally ran through Ohio, but was 

shifted westward many times until it reached its present position, on and 

near the Indiana-Illinois border.<p>

	

	<br clear=all>

	

	<h4>Environment</h4>



			<img src="./environ.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

	

	This month brings some reason for hope concerning Eastern Europe's 

beleaguered environment: Switzerland forgives 20 percent of Bulgaria's 

Swiss-franc debt in return for Bulgaria's commitment to invest an equal 

sum--about $18 million--in domestic environmental projects. 

Debt-for-environmental-action swaps originated in 1987, when a nonprofit 

organization, Conservation International, bought $650,000 of Bolivia's 

foreign debt in exchange for Bolivia's promise to establish a national 

park. Since then at least 16 debtor countries--in the Caribbean, 

Africa, Eastern Europe,  and Latin America--have made similar deals 

with official and nongovernmental organizations in the United States. <p>

	

	<br clear=all>

	

	<h4>The Skies</h4>



			<img src="./skies.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

	

	April <B>2</B>, Venus lies on the edge of the Pleiades, a compact star 

cluster, high in the western skies after sunset. <B>3</B>, Full Moon, also 

known this month as the Sprouting Grass and Little Frogs Croak Moon. Also 

tonight a lunar eclipse will reach totality at 6:26 P.M. EST--during 

moonrise in the eastern United States. By the time the Moon rises in the 

Rocky Mountain states and westward, the eclipse will be mostly over. 

<B>7</B>, at 2:00 A.M. Daylight Saving Time begins; turn clocks ahead one 

hour.<p>

	

	<br clear=all>





	<h4>Arts &amp; Letters</h4>



			<img src="./arts.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

	

		Poetry gets a boost in schools, libraries, and bookstores across the 

country this month with the celebration of the first annual National 

Poetry Month. Initiated by the Academy of American Poets, the 

commemoration will include readings, workshops, and book displays. Also 

this month Sotheby's auctions some 1,200 lots of art, furniture, jewelry, 

books, and memorabilia from the estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 

Items featured on the block April <B>23-26 </B>will include a 1960 drawing 

by Robert Rauschenberg with images of John and Jacqueline Kennedy; a ring 

whose stone was cut from the 601-carat Lesotho diamond (a gift from 

Aristotle Onassis); and the Louis XVI desk on which President Kennedy 

signed the nuclear-test-ban treaty. The proceeds are expected to exceed $5 

million; they will go toward Onassis's estate taxes.<p>

	

	<br clear=all>

	

	<h4>Health &amp; Safety</h4>

	

	April <B>29</B>, working conditions into the next century could be 

affected by a report released today, as the National Institute for 

Occupational Safety and Health announces its research agenda for the 

coming decade. Although NIOSH--an arm of the Department of Health and 

Human Services--is a nonregulatory body, its findings often influence 

rulings of the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health 

Administration. The institute also makes science-based recommendations to 

employers. Its concerns in the coming years are likely to include 

occupational asthma, the quality of indoor environments, and violence and 

assaults in the workplace. Among the reports NIOSH has released in recent 

years are one, in 1994, challenging claims that back-support belts help 

prevent injury and one, in 1991, disputing the notion that frequent 

exposure to computer screens increases the risk of miscarriage. <p>

	<h4>50 Years Ago</h4>

	

			<img src="./75yrs.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>



	Bergen Evans, writing in the April, 1946, issue of <I>The Atlantic 

Monthly</I>: "Irrationality must come close to being the largest single 

vested interest in the world. It has a dozen service stations in every 

town. There are twenty-five thousand practicing astrologers in America who 

disseminate their lore through a hundred daily columns, fifteen monthly 

and two annual publications. . . . It is even said that there is a 

movement on foot to have a Federal astrologer appointed as an officer of 

the government, and considering the official recognition given to other 

forms of clairvoyance, the movement may succeed."<p>

	<h4>Environment</h4>
	
	December <b>31</b>, as of today U.S. and Canadian companies must stop producing
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), ozone-depleting chemicals contained in industrial
solvents, air-conditioners, and refrigeration systems (equipment already
containing CFCs may still be used, and small amounts may be produced for the
Space Shuttle and for asthma inhalers). The ban is mandated by amendments to
the 1990 Clean Air Act and to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, an international
environmental agreement. It has necessitated the overhaul of America's $135
billion cooling infrastructure, resulting in added costs for industry and in
price jumps for consumers. The Environmental Protection Agency expects that
ridding the country of CFCs will cost $45 billion through 2075, but will save
as much as $32 trillion during that time from reduced rates of skin cancer,
crop damage, and other CFC-related problems.
	
	<br clear=all>
	<h4>The Skies</h4>

		<img src="./skies.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

	December <b>6</b>, Full Moon, also known this month as the Moon Before Yule or Big
Freezing Moon. <b>14</b>, the Geminid meteor shower peaks at 5:00 A.M. EST. Because of
interference at this time from the waning but still-large Moon, observers will
probably see more shooting stars--and lose less sleep--by scanning the heavens
during the evenings of the 13th and the 14th. <b>22</b>, at 3:20 A.M. EST, the Winter
Solstice. Daylight hours slowly begin to increase. <b>31</b>, a leap second will be
added to the U.S. Master Clock in Washington, D.C., between the last second of
1995 and the first of 1996.
	
	<br clear=all>
	<h4>Government</h4>
	
		<img src="./mail.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

	
	December <b>5</b>, primaries will be held in Oregon for a replacement for the former
senator Bob Packwood. There will be no lines at polling places: both the
primaries and the general election, on January 30, will be conducted by mail,
making this the first statewide election handled wholly in this way. Ballots
will be sent to all registered voters; they must be returned by 8:00 P.M. on
the day of the election, either by mail or at designated drop-off sites.
Proponents believe that this method saves money and increases participation.
<b>31</b>, the Resolution Trust Corporation--a temporary entity established by
Congress in 1989 to manage and resolve failed savings-and-loan
institutions--goes out of existence today, a year earlier than initially
anticipated, its mission essentially completed. All the 747 failed institutions
for which the RTC had been appointed receiver have been sold or their insured
depositors paid off. Savings-and-loans that became insolvent after June 30 of
this year will be handled by the FDIC-administered Savings Association
Insurance Fund.
	
	<br clear=all>
	<h4>Health &amp; Safety</h4>
	
			<img src="./scales.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>
	
	December <b>31</b>, those whose New Year's resolutions involve shedding excess pounds
may find the task ahead especially daunting in view of new U.S. Department of
Agriculture weight guidelines, due for release by today. The updated guidelines
retract previous allowances for a 10-to-15-pound weight gain after the age of
35; for example, a 36-year-old five-foot-eight-inch man will now be deemed
overweight at 165 pounds, whereas previously he would have been considered of
appropriate weight even at 178 pounds. One third of American adults qualify as
overweight under the old guidelines; half will do so under the new ones. Nearly
300,000 deaths a year are attributed to overweight, which is associated with
high blood pressure, diabetes, pulmonary problems, increased LDL (harmful)
cholesterol, decreased HDL (beneficial) cholesterol, and certain types of
cancer.
	
	
	<br clear=all>
	<h4>Food</h4>

			<img src="./cow.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

	
	December <b>31</b>, the U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to publish new rules for
meat and poultry inspection by today. The current system has relied primarily
on inspectors' sight, touch, and smell; although modifications have been made
in the interim, the system dates from meat-inspection regulations passed in
1906. The new rules will emphasize scientific testing and the prevention,
rather than the mere detection, of contamination. They are likely to call for
plantwide sanitary safeguards and daily testing for bacteria, and to spell out
procedures for protecting meat and poultry at various critical points in
production. Some 5 million Americans suffer each year from the results of
eating contaminated meat and poultry. Undercooked hamburgers contaminated with
<i>E. coli </i>bacteria and sold at fast-food restaurants in California and
Washington in 1993 were blamed for the deaths of four customers--an incident
that helped to spark the USDA's re-evaluation of its inspection system.
	
	<br clear=all>

	<h4>Arts &amp; Letters</h4>
	
			<img src="./spot.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

	
	December <b>11</b>, in New York the New Victory Theater opens its doors today,
launching a new era on 42nd Street. This refurbishment of the 95-year-old
Victory Theater--New York's oldest surviving playhouse, which hosted stage
legends like Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish--will operate as a nonprofit
venture featuring theater, music, and films for youths and families. The New
Victory's opening follows more than a decade of efforts to rejuvenate a
district long characterized by vacant buildings and pornographic fare. Plans
are under way for the restoration of eight other theaters. The new 42nd Street
will have a distinctly conglomerate quality: other projects in the works
include a Disney-owned musical theater and a movie-theater complex.
	
	<br clear=all>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h4>125 Years Ago</h4>
	
	Samuel McChord Crothers, writing in the December, 1920, issue of <i>The
Atlantic Monthly</i>: "It is the boast of the literary artist that he holds the
mirror up to Nature. But the mirror is nothing more or less than his own mind,
and the reflection must depend upon the qualities of that mind. The mirror may
be cracked, it may have all sorts of convexities and concavities, its original
brightness may have been lost. All kinds of distortions and flatteries are
possible. Some minds are capable only of caricature, and every object reflected
becomes amusing. Others invest the most trifling circumstance with mystery and
dignity."

Little Rock: A Visit with Bill Clinton</center></h1> <p>



<p>



 <p><center><font size=4>by The Editors</font></center>

<p><br><br><br><p>



<p>



<blockquote><font size=3><i>In 1992, on the eve of the presidential elections, 

a team of</i> Atlantic<i> editors traveled to Little Rock to meet Governor Bill 

Clinton.  The report of their visit makes interesting reading, particularly 

as Clinton now prepares to run for a second term.</i></font><p>



<p>



<p><br><p><br>



<font size=5>D</font><font size=3>uring the Democratic primary campaign Governor Bill

Clinton's verbosity became a strange part of his "character problem." To the

average voter, his endlessly detailed answers sounded confusing and therefore

deceptive. Among journalists they raised the suspicion that he was trying to

placate every interest group--point two will reassure the feminists, point

three will appeal to blacks--rather than projecting consistent, principled

views. The economic plan that Clinton released in June intensified this

problem. It listed a huge variety of positions but did not resolve

contradictions among them or say which were the more important. For instance,

the plan called for big increases in public investment, which sounds good--but

proposed to pay for them mainly through unspecified defense cutbacks and the

ever-elusive "administrative reforms."<p>







This was sensible politics--being only as specific as absolutely necessary. The

trick during a campaign is to find that narrow zone in which your positions are

not so hazy that they're laughable but are still vague enough that most people

can agree with them. "We can do better" always fits right in the zone, as do

recommendations for "change" and much of the Clinton plan.<p>







In an effort to ask Clinton about what lies behind the six-point checklists

with which he answers questions whenever he can, several representatives of The

Atlantic went to Little Rock to interview him. We also hoped to see at close

range how well he was bearing up under the rigors of the campaign. Part of the

"convention bounce" he enjoyed may have been the subliminal recognition of how

much sheer wear and tear he had survived. Paul Tsongas could not have withstood

the physical demands of a full campaign; George Bush probably couldn't if he

didn't have the White House apparatus to prop him up. Ross Perot quit when the

press coverage went mildly sour. Bill Clinton kept on plugging. <p>







Clinton has resisted the vindictiveness that comes naturally in political

campaigns. As a law of nature, politicians hate the press. Most end up thinking

that there's some special reason the press discriminates against them. Mario

Cuomo is notably touchy about anti-Italian stereotypes, Lyndon Johnson was

ruined by the suspicion that the Ivy Leaguers were looking down on him,

Patricia Schroeder thinks she's not taken seriously because she's a woman,

Richard Nixon knew that the liberal Jewish media establishment was after him.

Clinton has actually been the victim of anti-southern "Bubba" prejudice,

especially during the New York primary. But if it bothers him, it doesn't

show.<p>







Clinton was affable, though understandably tired-looking, when we met him in

the governor's mansion. He is bigger and bulkier than he looks on TV. Before

the Democratic convention Clinton's national TV exposure was mainly through

call-in shows and televised debates, rather than the rallies and speeches of

the general-election campaign. During these early appearances he sometimes

seemed to smile too much and too insincerely, like a game-show host. In person

he had the natural charm of the born politician, along with a wryness that does

not always come through on TV. By this stage in a presidential campaign a

candidate has heard almost every question and can rattle off answers

automatically. But a number of times Clinton paused for ten or fifteen seconds

before answering a question, and he usually made a good-faith effort to address

exactly the question we had raised. <p>







Clinton covered a wide variety of topics comfortably and lucidly. In the few

areas in which he hadn't yet worked out a policy--for example, immigration--he

said so, and in most other areas he clearly laid out his position, listed the

supporting arguments, and dealt with the main objections. In most of the

interview we didn't lay a glove on him, and we left with no doubt about his

intelligence or detailed operating knowledge of government. But we tried to

explore the apparent contradictions in two parts of his economic policy: his

plan for dealing with the budget deficit, and his strategy for international

trade.<p>







When talking about economics, Clinton seemed to be juggling two styles of

thought, which was not true when the subject was race or abortion. His economic

views, in his policy statements as well as in our discussion, switch between

those of the A student and those of the pol. The A student recommends the

respectable, well-thought-out policies that will be praised in universities and

on editorial pages. The pol is concerned about getting elected and holding

coalitions together. For instance: Every A student knows that America should

have a much higher gasoline tax. The pol knows that people hate the sound of a

gasoline tax, and they'll resist it unless you can tell them that the money

will be used for some purpose they approve of, such as repairing roads. <p>







The contrast between the two personalities is not the contrast between good and

evil--between doing the right thing and merely "being political." It's a matter

of proportion. Someone who is just an A student, like Michael Dukakis or John

Anderson, won't become President--and if he slips through, the way Jimmy Carter

did, he'll have a hard time getting politicians to do anything for him. Someone

who seems to be just a pol, like George Bush, will be concerned only about

holding the coalition together and won't care in what direction it goes.

Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were fundamentally pols, but they had

enough interest in policy to keep their coalitions heading in a certain

direction. Bill Clinton's answers to us indicated a similar internal balance.<p>







The most pol-like thing Clinton did during the primary campaign was to attack

Paul Tsongas, in Florida, as an enemy of Social Security. Tsongas had mentioned

in his pamphlet-sized "book" that it might be sensible to hold down the

cost-of-living adjustment for entitlement programs. Every A student who has

thought about the federal budget knows that if you don't find some way to limit

Social Security and Medicare, you will never, ever reduce the budget deficit.

Every pol knows that you want your opponent to raise this issue, because no

matter how limited and reasonable his proposal may be, you can make it sound

like an assault on the entire system. The politics of this issue is maddening

to A students, because it has created a welfare mentality in the population at

large. Most retirees are now getting much more back from the Social Security

system than they have "earned," in actuarial terms. But politicians and the

American Association of Retired Persons have encouraged the view that not a

penny can be touched--not even if it's for the elderly rich, the Ross Perot of

a few years hence who will be fully entitled to his pension and Medicare. As a

result, working families pay a regressive and steadily rising Social Security

tax to transfer benefits to retirees who are on average richer than their

children's generation. One paragraph in Tsongas's book referred to this issue

without the usual hedging comments, and the Clinton campaign used it in ads

portraying Tsongas as a threat to the elderly in general.<p>







We asked Clinton whether he regretted doing this, and what he intended to do

about entitlement costs. Here he was clearly aware of the A-student position,

which is that the Social Security problem represents the conflict of two

American ideals. Universal-benefit programs, from public schools to Social

Security, are better than targeted programs like welfare, because it's not

humiliating to take part in them and because all taxpayers get something for

their money; but universal benefits can be unfair when poor people pay taxes to

support benefits for the rich. One American ideal is to keep everyone in the

same boat; the other is to give help only to those who need it. Today's

entitlement system tries to do both. <p>







"What I explicitly said," the governor told us, "was that I thought the way to

reform the entitlements was to make upper-income recipients pay more of their

load, but that I thought the universality of the entitlement programs was

important. It may be an important symbolic issue of fairness to ask older

people with higher incomes to pay more for Medicare and to subject most or all

of their income from Social Security to taxation. I think you can make that

case pretty plainly, that it's important symbolically. But more than that is

getting control of health-care costs."<p>







With that we were off on an A-student alternative: Clinton's argument that we

shouldn't waste our time on Social Security, since the only entitlement costs

that really matter are the costs of the health-care programs, mainly Medicare.

He said, "The major entitlement reform that swamps everything else--nothing

else is even close--is doing what it takes to get health costs into line with

inflation." The real reason for this approach must be Clinton's calculation, as

a pol, that Social Security is a minefield. But Clinton made an extended

A-student case for emphasizing medical costs.<p>







"You know that the insurance companies, the health-care administrative costs,

and the providers are doing very well in this system, and we have no system for

controlling health-care costs," he said. "Health-care costs are going up eleven

to twelve percent per annum, while revenues are going up five percent, four and

a half. That's basically where the entitlement choke is. So I say, let's go

after health-insurance costs, where the big bucks are, reduce poverty with

earned-income tax credits and other strategies, and make the wealthy pay more

of their fair share of Medicare."<p>







Is it possible to limit these costs without limiting care--itself as difficult

an issue as limiting Social Security?<p>







"That depends on whether we have the courage to reform the system. But the

answer has to be yes, if you analyze where the dollars are going in the

American system as compared with any other. We spend thirty percent more than

any other country and do less with it in terms of basic coverage. It makes you

say, Where are the dollars going here that they're not going in other places?

It's not so much exotic surgery but prolonged care for people in the last weeks

of their life. We do spend more on that than other people do; the problem is,

it's hard to know when the last week of your life is. <p>







"But the real dollars are in insurance and administrative costs, where we're

sixty or seventy billion dollars out of line with any other country with a

comprehensive system. Doctor fees are not so much the problem as the repetition

of services is--and the lack of a network of primary and preventive care, which

leads too many people to get care only when it's too late and too expensive and

at the emergency room, on somebody else's nickel. So if you were to reform

those central elements, there's no doubt in my mind that within a matter of

just a very few years you could bring health-care costs down in line with

inflation." This sounds clean and logical, and it may suffice for the campaign.

But Clinton must know that such reforms will be very hard to enact and at best

will reduce, rather than solve, the medical-financing problem. And the

minefield of Social Security will remain.<p>







The other unresolved issue in Clinton's economic policy concerns international

competition and trade. His plan, which takes its name from his slogan "Putting

People First," says that America must be robustly committed to the principle of

free trade. But if other nations don't play by these rules, then "we'll play by

theirs." This is like saying "We believe in peace, but if we have to, we'll use

the F-15s." It leaves out all the details about where and why you would

fight.<p>







On this issue the difference between A students and pols is clear-cut. "We'll

play by their rules" implies protectionism, and for A students protectionism is

always wrong. No respectable national-newspaper editorialist, and almost no

academic, will praise a candidate for suggesting protectionist measures--ask

Richard Gephardt after his campaign in 1988. The term "protectionist" is less

damning than "racist," but it is similar in suggesting a benighted view. In

fact every nation practices protectionism of some sort. (The only obvious

exception is Hong Kong, and it's not really a country.) Nations vary in how

deliberately they plan the policies and which industries they protect, but they

all do something. Pols instinctively realize this and know that protectionism

can be popular in us-versus-them terms: Who's going to have those jobs in steel

mills, the Koreans or us?<p>







Two conflicting world views shape current discussions of trade policy. One

might be called the Field of Dreams concept: If we improve it, they will come.

The "it" is America's productive infrastructure--schools, research facilities,

roads, fiber-optic networks, and the other things that make factories

comfortable. "They" are the global corporations that, according to this theory,

are no longer attached to any nation but flow rapidly from site to site in the

now borderless world. If we prepare properly, the investment will arrive--and

it won't matter if it's from Daimler-Benz, Ford, or Toyota, because they're all

stateless capitalists now. The other concept, which might be called The World

As We Know It, assumes that the borderless future is not quite at hand. Other

countries take active steps to promote their own industries--which they

continue to think of as their own. In this view the welfare of American workers

is tied to the strength of American companies, so in addition to building the

schools and fiber-optic systems, the government should care how Ford, Boeing,

and Motorola fare. In practice, the difference between these outlooks boils

down to the question of whether the government should discriminate in favor of

U.S.-based companies, preferring them over foreign competitors when granting

contracts, supporting technology, or imposing tariffs.<p>







Probably the strongest case against the Field of Dreams outlook is exemplified

by the U.S. semiconductor industry. Every Field of Dreams reform you can think

of for, say, Chrysler had already been applied in Silicon Valley in 1980.

Employees were happy and well trained. Companies were run by engineers, not

evil financiers. They invested for the long haul, and they had a good

infrastructure. Labor relations was not really an issue, because most companies

didn't classify the employees as "labor." And over the next five years the

industry caved in more rapidly than the steel and auto industries had. <p>







Its successful rivals--first in Japan, then in Korea--were coordinated by their

respective governments. Without exception, countries that now have

semiconductor industries got their start with government guidance and help.

When the American semiconductor industry began, in the 1950s, the U.S.

government--specifically the Defense Department and the space program--was for

several crucial years the major and sometimes the only customer for its

products. When the industry revived in the late 1980s, it did so, yes, because

of its own efforts--plus government intervention, in the form of new trade

treaties and research consortia.<p>







The conflict between the two views is built into Clinton's campaign. Robert

Reich, a prominent exponent of the Field of Dreams concept, is one of his close

advisers. But another is Ira Magaziner, a champion of the real-world view.

(Lester Thurow, another prominent academic in the real-world camp, is not

connected with the Clinton campaign.) The first camp is the A-student position;

the second is for pols. In most of his campaign statements Clinton has sounded

like an A student, emphasizing the mobility of capital in a borderless age. We

asked Clinton which side he was on. He said that his policy would depend on

where he was sitting --in the governor's mansion of a small state or in the

White House.<p>







"As a governor, I have to deal with the realities of the global

economy--factories moving to Mexico, the acquisition of foreign investment as

well as domestic investment. Having lived through this, the conclusion I have

drawn is as follows: Money, management, and production are by and large mobile

and will become increasingly so. What they can't take away from you are the

skills of your people, the quality of your infrastructure, the care and feeding

of your natural resources, the work that you do in your own country on research

and development and turning your ideas into jobs at home. Those are the core

things. <p>







"Nonetheless, it is still true that it matters who owns significant chunks of

your economy. You need a manufacturing base in your own country. That requires

domestic policies which reward the companies that are here in research and

development and don't subsidize the flight of those jobs overseas.<p>







"I'll give you an example, a good-news bad-news thing. Bridgestone Tires in

Japan buys Firestone in America. For Arkansas it's a blessing, because

Firestone had two plants here; they were in some trouble. Bridgestone had

plenty of money. They came in here, spent thirty million dollars modernizing

these plants, retrained the workers, gave them the benefit of modern

management, and expanded the work force. It's a good thing. On the other hand,

over the long run there will be relatively more upscale R&amp;D work done by

that company in Japan than would be the case if it were an American company."<p>







Clinton didn't say how he would resolve the issue, but he showed that he

clearly understands the arguments on both sides. (Imagine discussing this with

George Bush.) The pol side of this issue probably reflects his true instinct.

When Clinton talks about the "middle class," it seems that what he really means

is something fairly close to a post-industrial working class (whose members, he

knows, would hate being labeled in that way). Several times in our interview he

mentioned the working poor, although we didn't ask him about that group; he had

just rearranged his economic plan to direct its tax benefits downward on the

economic scale. If it's fair to say that every President governs with the

welfare of one group particularly in mind, for Clinton that group would be

middle-class suburbanites--but from suburbs like Mount Vernon and Torrance, not

Greenwich and Beverly Hills, with jobs like secretary and deliveryman, not

doctor and stockbroker. Because these people don't consider themselves to be

part of a permanent "class" in the Marxian sense, what they would look for from

government would be opportunity more than equality: jobs for themselves, and

education--especially college--for their kids, much more than tax relief.

Presumably that would fit with an expanded and aggressive domestic role for

government, rather than the (mostly theoretical) grand scaling-back of the

federal government which we've had since 1981. <p>







When he discussed subjects other than economics, Clinton displayed much less of

the A-student-pol division. He spoke at length about race, and his positions

seemed for the most part to coincide with what he had learned firsthand. <p>







We began by asking him what, in his view, were the most dishonest things that

blacks and whites say and think about each other. <p>







"I think whites tend to be, on the subconscious level, too willing to believe

that there are inherent racial differences, which does not take account of some

of the terrible conditions in which blacks and other minorities live in this

country. I think that too many whites have underestimated the crushing impact

of economic decline and family decline that a lot of black families have been

subject to, that would have produced similar results had they occurred among

people of any race. And on the other hand, others, including [white] liberals,

tend to have expectations that are too low for people, based on their race, so

they feel uncomfortable challenging people to do better and disagreeing with

them on the basis of ideas. <p>







"It is difficult to generalize about blacks and how they feel, but I think

there are too many blacks who blame other people for problems that people can

only solve themselves--on occasion. But that is difficult to generalize,

because the black church and black community leaders are more and more adopting

a kind of dual strategy, which I think is very good. [They say,] 'You know,

we've got to make this system work for us. But we've also got to do our part.

We've got to change ourselves.'"<p>







And what about whites' understanding of their own racial views? How honest and

accurate is it?<p>







"I think at one level most whites think they are free of prejudice. But I don't

think that most people have thought through the enormity of the dimensions of

the problem, and what kind of action ought to be taken by us as a nation to

deal with it. And so I think that a lot of whites have sort of let themselves

off the hook--you know, 'I don't wake up every morning consumed with racial

hatred. I am, therefore, not prejudiced. Therefore there's nothing for me to do

or feel or say.'"<p>







When Clinton was a boy, the race problem was defined as a southern issue, one

that centered on an apartheidlike system of separation and denial of legal

rights. Now race is clearly a national, not a regional, problem--and we asked

Clinton to define exactly what the problem is. "What's wrong," he said, "is

that objectively blacks, and to a lesser degree Hispanics, are--profoundly

are--worse off than the rest of the country, more likely to suffer from

economic and social difficulties that are profound and that make the good life

much more difficult." <p>







What, if anything, can a President do about this? Clinton specifically rejected

using quotas to enforce "equality as a result," as Lyndon Johnson proposed in

his famous Howard University speech in 1965, or expanding civil-rights law, so

that disadvantaged groups can more easily use the courts to defend their

economic interests.<p>







"I don't think the government in this society is capable of mandating equality

of result . . . that the American people should try to mandate a quota system

on our society. [As for civil rights laws,] I don't think they are irrelevant.

As long as there is a disproportionate impact by race or gender on the

difficulties we face, they're not irrelevant. But I think a lot of what we do

doesn't have to be race-based. I mean, Social Security wasn't a constitutional

right. It was a political decision. We ought to have an election and a

political debate in which we say there are several ways in which we are

diminishing the capacities of our people and weakening our country."<p>







As solutions Clinton emphasized economic growth--with reminders that this is

connected to education and trade and infrastructure projects and everything

else--and an attempt to change personal values. In the past generation, he

said, the government has clearly helped shift attitudes about smoking.

Something similar is possible with attitudes toward work and family. Does this

mean the kind of "values" speeches that Vice President Dan Quayle was giving in

the spring?<p>







"It's okay to talk about values. It is critically important to try to imbue

within people a value structure that will change their behavior. But if all you

do is talk about values while you pursue policies"--such as, we assumed, tax

changes that hurt the working poor--"that you know will aggravate the very

conditions you are railing against, then you're being hypocritical. That's my

problem with Quayle and Bush. It would suit me fine if they had a minister I

admired to the White House once a month, and let him or her talk about values.

But the problem is that their behavior is inconsistent with the real world,

which requires us to do more than preach about values. It's 'values plus'--it's

not only values, it's values plus action that supports those values. And from

my point of view, they're 'values minus.' I think the Democrats, or anybody

else, would make a great mistake to minimize the impact of this values appeal,

but it rings hollow if your policies are inconsistent with the values you

espouse."<p>







The racial matter of which Clinton seemed to lack an instinctive grasp was the

question of what to do about the problems of the big inner-city ghettos

--problems that exist in Arkansas but that are an overwhelming issue in Los

Angeles and New York and Chicago. He repeatedly cited William Julius Wilson's

1987 book The Truly Disadvantaged, which says that today's ghetto social

problems, such as crime, welfare dependency, and family disintegration, are

primarily the result of the loss of good manufacturing jobs. Clinton seemed to

be using Wilson's book as a kind of talisman, in a way he wouldn't have done

with a book about an issue with which he was personally more familiar. For

example, he told us that according to Wilson, at the end of the Second World

War, when the economies of New York and Detroit and Chicago were strong, the

black and white rates for out-of-wedlock birth were about the same. "This is

all a phenomenon of my lifetime," Clinton said. In fact Wilson doesn't use this

particular statistic; he couldn't, because at the end of the Second World War

the percentage of births out of wedlock was eight times as high for blacks as

for whites. But Clinton seems to have filed away in his mind a sound-bite-like

statement along the lines of "the ghetto underclass was created by

deindustrialization." <p>







If Clinton truly took on the underclass as President, he'd surely find, as the

past few Democratic Presidents have found, that the ghettos are surprisingly

resistant to the good old Democratic medicine of economic growth and low

unemployment. A different approach would be to assume that the ghettos'

problems are primarily cultural, and focus mostly on social acculturation

programs targeted on high-poverty areas. Pols always want to do some of

each--especially Clinton, who seemingly hates having to endorse either side of

any complicated issue.<p>







Still, that you can even worry about how Clinton would deepen his understanding

of such subjects makes him unusual. He obviously views racial healing as one of

the most important jobs for the next President. He also seems to have a sure,

centrist sense of the political perils of the issue. In the 1960s, liberals

helped destroy the tenuous public support for Great Society anti-poverty

programs by making grants to the likes of the Blackstone Rangers, a Chicago

gang. Clinton emphasized the need to sustain broad political support: <p>







"I think that upper-middle-class people are ready to be challenged to help

people in the cities help themselves. That's why welfare reform has such a

powerful resonance in the suburbs. It is not because people want to punish poor

people. It's because the experience of people living in the suburbs is that

they helped themselves into the suburbs. You speak to the suburbs [and

recommend] not maintaining dependence but creating independence. I think that

has a powerful resonance, because it makes what you want to do with poor folks

consistent with the life experience of middle- and upper-middle-class

America."<p>







The most personally revealing answer Clinton gave during our visit concerned

Vietnam. First he presented a dull but worthy discourse on the lessons the

United States should and shouldn't draw. (We can't fight someone else's war,

but we have to be ready to fight some wars.) Then he was asked, "Do you now

wish you'd gone?" He paused for a quite a while before answering.<p>







"I can't say that. You know, I was raised in the post-World War Two generation.

I always kind of wanted to be in the military. I always liked and admired it.

And it's something that I missed in a way--that I missed. But to say that I

wished I'd gone would require me to rewrite history to an extraordinary extent.









"I had an opportunity that few people of my generation had, because I worked on

the Foreign Relations Committee. I had a security clearance. I read six

newspapers a day. I sat there through all those hearings. I knew more than most

people did--that we weren't being told the truth about how we were doing and

what we were doing and what our objectives were. I've often wondered whether I

should wish that at that age I didn't know what I knew. But I believe now, just

as strongly as I believed then, that our policy was wrong and misguided and

that we would have been better off if we had changed it before we did. <p>







"Because I was a kid from Arkansas, a state with a great patriotic tradition,

and because I loved my country, I never wanted to feel that I was not patriotic

or that my feelings and actions were dictated by just a desire to stay out of

harm's way. But I felt--I mean, the passion of my feelings about it was so deep

that I think it would be just rewriting history for me to say [I wish I'd

gone]. I wish that I'd had the military experience, because I feel that it's an

important part of a country to have a strong defense and an honorable thing to

do. But the circumstances of that moment were so difficult and unusual that I

can't go back and say that I'd rewrite history."<p>







At the end of the interview we gave Clinton another chance to surmount the

Jimmy Carter-like problem of having many positions but no identifiable point of

view. "If you had to sum up your message for the fall campaign in three,

preferably immortal, sentences, what would they be?"<p>





This time Clinton really sat and thought, and then gave us five, with a

distinct pause at the end of each sentence: "Our country is in trouble, losing

its way economically and coming apart socially. Our government has failed to

work for most Americans, favoring special interests and the wealthiest of us

only. We need to rebuild America, and to reunite America with policies that put

our people at the center of national life, investing in more jobs, basic health

care, and world-class education, and with a commitment to pull people together

again. We don't have a person to waste, but the problems today are not nearly

as great as our lack of faith that we can overcome them. That's the real

obstacle."<p></blockquote>

	<A NAME="media"><H3>Hating the Media</H3></A>
	
	
	
	<font size=5>T</font>here is more to the incident described by James Fallows in "Why Americans Hate
the Media" (February <i>Atlantic </i>) concerning Mike Wallace's opinion on
whether a reporter working with an enemy patrol is morally obliged to warn
fellow Americans about to be ambushed.<p>

In preparing a book on the military and the media, I came across a secondhand
account of that discussion and wrote Mr. Wallace to verify it. He responded
immediately, by telephone. "I responded without having had time to think about
the subject," he said, "and immediately began to have second thoughts."<p>

"I am an American," he continued. "I fought for our country in World War Two. I
am not going to see American fighting men and women killed or injured if there
is anything I can do to stop it. But, having had time to think about that
question, I don't think it can be addressed outside of the much larger question
of whether the press should seek to get people behind enemy lines in time of
war. Once you are in there . . . you are no longer a free agent."<p>

Year after year reporters, and sometimes their editors, participate in
war-college symposia and go away thinking they have "explained" the press to
the military. But what the military has learned from those encounters is,
first, that every reporter is on his or her own, and will gladly cut the throat
of any colleague; and, second, that the press lacks the depth to understand any
complex story, not just stories about the military.<p>

Contrary to what R. W. Apple Jr. claims in the February 4 <i>New York Times </i>
"Week in Review," it was not exclusion by the military that distorted coverage
of the Persian Gulf War but careful exploitation of those two observed
weaknesses. That will continue to be the case until the press overhauls its
entire concept of organization and training. Fallows's article and book make an
important contribution to creating the public pressure that must be built up in
order for that to happen.<p>

	<font size=5>J</font>ames Fallows's castigation of the news media is a valuable and
convincing alert: a crucial component of our democracy is not functioning. But
Fallows does not dispute certain basic facts of news economics that are surely
known to him and his readers: issues research is more costly than political
chitchat, and chitchat sells better anyway. The hard-news carnivores his
article features are not representative of our entertainment-loving citizenry.
Polls showing a desire for more upbeat news do not indicate a thirst for
elucidation of policy issues. It is in fact reasonable to assume that
journalism is effectively responding to its economic incentives, as one would
expect. In terms of solutions, Fallows's essay thus amounts to an exhortation
to the news industry to act more honorably despite its self-interest--which is
obviously futile.<p>

	<A NAME="integrity"><H3>On Integrity</H3></A>
	
	<font size=5>I</font>n reference to Stephen L. Carter's "The Insufficiency of Honesty" (February
<i>Atlantic </i>): integrity has its roots in "in" (not) "tangere" (to touch),
and means the quality of being "untouched, whole, complete." It is related to
"integrate," to "make whole or complete by adding or bringing together
parts."<p>

In reference to human beings, integrity implies that one is complete unto
oneself. And to be human and whole is to know and accept ourselves with
strengths and weaknesses and to relate intimately with others on the basis of
our inner wholeness and knowledge rather than outer customs or morals.
Integrity further implies inner and outer consistency.<p>

Which takes us to Carter's dying man. Carter no doubt chose this extreme
example because he assumes that most people will say, "Of course the man
shouldn't tell."<p>

He's right: most people live distant lives, shut off from other people by what
they will not tell. And they have many excuses, the most frequent being that
they might hurt someone's feelings. This is a ruse, as Carter points out; they
are afraid to tell the truth because they are trying to protect themselves from
loss (of power, love, position), from anger, from the nakedness of exposure.<p>

A person of integrity would not wait thirty-five years to tell his wife about
an affair, and he would never "confess." He would tell his wife immediately, or
he might even tell her before it happened, when it was just a thought but not
yet a plan. And if he made the mistake of putting off his telling, he would
eventually tell because the affair was a fact of his life that intruded on the
intimacy between him and his wife, not because it was "killing his spirit." A
person of integrity does not judge either himself or others so harshly as to
kill off parts of himself or other people.<p>

Carter's ending for the story, his melodramatic description of the
twice-faithless man and the grieving soon-to-be widow who would choose illusion
over substance, aptly demonstrates the errors we make when we treat others not
as beings having integrity but as children whom we must arrogantly protect in
much the same way that Carter's manager protected his employee. Neither Carter,
as the story's author, nor his character can assume knowledge of the wife's
reaction to her husband's affair, because we don't know if she is a woman of
integrity. Maybe she, too, had an affair, and would feel great relief, the
lifting of her own guilt. Maybe she would feel sorry for her husband for
suffering so long when he could have told her and would have been forgiven.
Maybe she would confirm a long suspicion and have newfound confidence in her
intuition. Maybe she wouldn't give a damn. Maybe she would give her husband an
extra dose of morphine to end it all just a bit sooner.<p>

The person of integrity would never, ever take from her the opportunity to make
her own choice and respond as she will.<p>

	<font size=5>T</font>o the husband whose deathbed confession of infidelity hurts his wife I
say, <i>Go for it! </i>Why shouldn't he manage his death as he chooses, doing
for himself what he needs to do?<p>

If her happiness was predicated on a fiction, what was its intrinsic worth? As
an adult, why shouldn't she be responsible for doing the hard work of
reconciling this fact about the marriage she was a party to with the fiction
she had imagined? To protect her from this information is to patronize her and
rob her of vital knowledge about the reality of her own life.<p>

Rather than accept Carter's sappy deathbed moral melodrama, which casts the
wronged woman as a passive victim, I choose to believe that she will marshal
the strength to confront the truth and the resilience to learn from it and move
on.<p>

Some of the happiest women I know are widows.<p>

	<font size=5>I</font> enjoyed and concurred with "The Insufficiency of Honesty." As a priest
(Episcopal), I have been asked several times by a penitent in the confessional
for advice on whether to confess infidelity to a spouse. On each of the
occasions the "injured" spouse was totally unaware of any unfaithfulness. And
in each case I advised against telling for the same reason Stephen Carter
speaks of in his article. I have added that for the penitent to keep silent
might well be part of an appropriate penance.<p>

	<A NAME="poetry"><H3>The Poetry Judge</H3></A>
	
	<font size=5>I</font> found Garrison Keillor's "The Poetry Judge" 
	(February <i>Atlantic </i>) very funny and mostly all too true. His lampooning of Vietnam poems,
however, seems gratuitously unkind by the third time his narrator returns to
the subject. I wonder if Keillor is aware that the poet and Vietnam veteran
Michael Casey has won the Yale Younger Poets Award, the poet and Vietnam
veteran Yusef Komunyakaa has won both the Kingsley Tufts Award and the Pulitzer
Prize, the poet and Vietnam veteran Walter McDonald has won both the George
Elliston Prize and the Juniper Prize, and the poet John Balaban, who spent
three years in Vietnam as a civilian, has won both the Lamont Prize and a
National Poetry Series award. None of these awards is named for a lady with
three names. I would also direct Keillor's attention to the poetry of the
Vietnam veterans Doug Anderson, Kevin Bowen, D.&nbsp;F. Brown, David Connolly,
Horace Coleman, Gerald McCarthy, Basil Paquet, Dale Ritterbusch, and Bruce
Weigl, each of whom has taken true-life experience and transformed it into
literature.<p>

	<font size=5>G</font>arrison Keillor's poetry contest was <i>our </i> poetry contest--St. Paul's
AAUW. We in our basic bliss were thrilled to have him, the famous Garrison
Keillor, as one of our judges. So generous was he to refuse any remuneration.
So sensitive was he to the significance of such an effort. He seemed to
understand how much it meant to those inspired, pathetic protozoa who submitted
their absurd elegies to their dead cats, their odes to Vietnam buddies "blown
away yesterday," their lyrics on wedding receptions, their memories of Duluth,
and assorted other laughable "painful truths."<p>

I and my colleagues--who have also judged poetry contests and who have taught
poetry and who have tried to put a good face and some jaunty encouragement on
laughable lines penned by earnest "poets" who would like not to be killed
before they are born--regret that Keillor's tauntings in his fine story will
long reverberate painfully as professional judgment on what these would-be 
poets submitted.<p>

	<i>Garrison Keillor replies: </i><p>

There are in America marvelous poets doing brilliant and generous work, but my
story is about the state of amateur poetry and about the thousands of
creative-writing classes operated by kindly teachers who, like Joy Davis,
encourage bad writing. Ms. Davis refers to these amateurs as "pathetic
protozoa." I look on them as ambitious, intelligent persons who deserve better
teaching. Writing requires discipline, and it can be taught, but you don't find
it in turgid poems about Bad Daddies and The Struggle to Be Me and all the
other flat, morbid, narcissistic writing that is encouraged by bad
teaching. The creative-writing industry is cranking out reams of stuff that
nobody in his or her right mind would ever want to read. One genre it mostly
ignores is satire and humor. It takes discipline to tell a joke.<p>

<A NAME="horseback"><H3>Man on Horseback</H3></A>
	
	<font size=5>R</font>ichard Brookhiser may wish to review his listing of Presidents who saw or did
not see action in military service in the article "A Man on Horseback" (January
<i>Atlantic </i>).<p>

James Buchanan was in the Army in the War of 1812. He took part in the defense
of Baltimore and saw "the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air."<p>

Lyndon Johnson was in the Navy early in 1942 and made a famous bombing run when
his plane was heavily attacked. It may not have been a battle, but it was
certainly combat.<p>

Brookhiser says that Gerald Ford did not see battle. He was on a Navy ship in
the Pacific which was under air attack on many occasions. That should
qualify.<p>

Incidentally, two civilian Presidents were under enemy fire: James Madison, at
Bladensburg in the War of 1812, and Abraham Lincoln, when he observed
Confederate forces advancing on Washington, D.C., from the parapet of a fort.
Shots were fired, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. is reputed to have shouted at
Lincoln, "Get down, you damn fool!"<p>

	<font size=5>I</font> thoroughly enjoyed your article on George Washington and his
character. However, you missed one important influence on his character
formation: Christianity. Washington was raised in the Anglican Church and
retained his membership there throughout his life. After his death twenty-four
pages of handwritten prayers were found in Washington's papers. They express
his deep belief in God and Christian principles. Washington's life reflected
these beliefs. He wrote, "It is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the
providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits,
and humbly to implore his protection and favor."<p>

	<font size=5>R</font>ichard Brookhiser's article "A Man on Horseback" is extremely
informative. However, Brookhiser lists the sixteen American Presidents who
fought in battle and strikingly omits reference to Abraham Lincoln, who fought
in the Black Hawk War in 1832, as an Illinois Militia captain.<p>

	<i>Richard Brookhiser replies: </i><p>

I should have added Gerald Ford to my list of combatants. I might have added
Lyndon Johnson, who actually won a combat decoration, but Robert Caro's
description of how he earned it (by virtually staging a confrontation with the
enemy in order to qualify) persuaded me to leave him off. The others served, but
only by standing and waiting. <p>

Washington was a lifelong Anglican-Episcopalian, served as a vestryman, and
attended church fairly regularly, where his behavior was "serious and
attentive," according to one minister who observed it. But he made few
references to Jesus Christ in letters or speeches, he never took communion
(Martha always did), and the prayers Doug Le Mahieu mentions are not in his
handwriting.<p>

Washington did have a powerful belief in Providence, repeatedly expressed in
public and in private. If there was a moment that riveted it to his soul, it
probably occurred in the French and Indian War. After surviving the destruction
of General Edward Braddock's army in the wilderness, the twenty-three-year-old
colonel wrote to a friend, "See the wondrous works of Providence! The
uncertainty of human things!"<p>

<font size=5>W</font>E are all wringing our hands over the plight of 
failing, unstable regions of the Third World, especially those in 
sub-Saharan Africa.  But there is little consensus on what the American 
response should be.  Many liberals blame the West and racism for the Third

World's ills, and believe that democracy and <A

historical, cultural, and environmental forces that have been at work for 
centuries.  <A 
HREF="http://www.self-gov.org/freeman/8707maje.htm">Some conservatives think that the free market

even a display of interest in a place like <A 
HREF="http://www.vtourist.com/vt/africa.htm">Africa</A> indicates naive 
do-goodism.  At one extreme is Pat Buchanan, at the Mexican border with a 
gun and a black cowboy hat, holding off the tide of darker peoples.  At the 
other extreme is Mrs.  Jellyby, in Dickens's <i>Bleak House</i>, whose eyes 
"could see nothing nearer than Africa!" Mrs.  Jellyby let her London 
household go to ruin while she wrote letters all day in support of a tribe 
on the Niger River.  Caught among the various mindsets are well-meaning 
Washington bureaucrats who are trying to craft workable policies on global 
humanitarian issues.  <p> A durable foreign-aid consensus--one that might 
do gradual but unmistakable good where good can in fact be done--must be 
built on two seemingly contrary realizations: <p>

* Although some human societies have made end runs around their own histories
and environments, exceptionalism is, well, the exception. The fact that Africa
continues to fall economically behind the Indian subcontinent (the second
poorest region on the planet), despite billions spent on development assistance
over the decades, amounts to an inescapable negative judgment. Not even Russia,
with its 150 million people, 99 percent of whom are literate, can be pivotally
affected by aid. To think that aid can fundamentally change sub-Saharan Africa,
whose population is 3.75 times that of Russia and whose literacy rate is much,
much lower, is to take a position that few people outside a narrow intellectual
elite will accept. As our own historically high economic-growth rates fall, it
is not even clear that American exceptionalism can be counted on: we will have
less money in the future for foreign aid, not more.<p>

* Although development assistance rarely changes history dramatically, it can
do significant good in a significant number of places. And it can do good in
ways that help us to reinvent ourselves as a nation in the context of a more
interconnected world, while also promoting vital security interests. A growing
African middle class, for instance, would constitute an enormous market for
American products. An Africa in which viruses could be monitored and controlled
would preserve AIDS as a singularity rather than a harbinger of more pandemics.
Given that disease is affected by poverty, migration, and environmental trends,
helping Africa is strategically important if only in terms of cold
self-interest. <p>

A development policy toward the underdeveloped world must have the ability to
win political support in Washington and the nation at large. This is a simple
fact that no amount of idealism or wishful thinking can get around. A
development policy must engage us without overstraining us. Its criteria must
be clear. And it must not set us up for failure. Expensive stunts like the
invasions of Somalia and Haiti are risky in the context of an
isolationist-tending climate of political discourse. If such endeavors fail,
they threaten funding for useful programs in politically and economically
fragile places where hope survives.<p>

Herein is a rough sketch for a Third World aid policy. It is inspired in some
measure by the principle known as proportionalism, adopted by some Catholic
theologians on certain vexing moral issues. Proportionalism provides a useful
moral approach to the Third World. 


In theological terms proportionalism is
about doing or accepting a certain amount of "evil" to make possible a
proportionately greater amount of good; it underlies theories of a just war and
also, for some Catholics, the argument in favor of promoting the use of
contraceptives as a means of reducing abortion. In everyday, non-theological
terms it is about beating a retreat in order to preserve what is most
important. Proportionalism is anathema to moral and ideological purists. It
tempers implacable principle with common sense.<p>

Foreign-aid proportionalism would have three aspects: the aid itself, early
warning, and extremely rare interventions. What follows is a framework for
disparate ideas and policies that have been bruited about and in some cases
partly implemented.<p>

First, the foreign aid itself would not be increased overall, because 
forging a political consensus for maintaining levels as they are is hard 
enough.  But it would be targeted at bread-and-butter regionwide programs 
that seek to slow societal deterioration gradually, in order to create an 
environment for the emergence of healthier politics.  It would <i>not</i> 
be targeted at making a particular country democratic in the face of a low 
literacy rate, the absence of a middle class, and a history of ethnic or 
regional strife.  The Washington establishment chants that democracies 
don't go to war, but what are emerging in many places are 
pseudo-democracies, societies teetering on ungovernability which hold 
elections out of desperation rather than as the final step in a process of 
economic and political development.  Reduced emphasis on "democratic 
elections" would mean a new emphasis instead on <A 
HREF="http://www.msh.org/fpmd/fpmdhome.html"> population control</A>, women's 
literacy, and resource-renewal projects.  If more conservatives knew, for 
example, that an 85 percent cut in <A 
HREF="http://www.info.usaid.gov/">U.S. Agency for International 
Development</A> family-planning programs would lead to 1.6 million more 
abortions a year by desperate women in developing countries, enough of them 
might support renewing these programs to form a majority with liberals.  
Moreover, it has been shown that increased literacy among women reduces the 
birth rate: literate women exert more power in their relationships with 
men, control their own lives and those of their children better, and use 
financial and natural resources more intelligently.  Nothing promotes 
positive social evolution in the Third World more speedily than women's 
education.<p>

Second, early warning. Some equate pessimism about the Third World with
cynicism. In truth, pessimism is often both a realistic and a moral response:
we <i>should</i> be scouting for trouble, not indulging fond hope. Probing for
trouble in advance--as the United States is doing now in <A 
HREF="http://198.76.84.1/HORN/burundi/usstate/testimny.txt">Burundi</A>--will not
always pay dividends. But there will be times when conflict management sooner
will forestall more agonizing choices later. <p>

The third aspect is intervention--the rarer the better.  The so-called 
Powell Doctrine--which calls for intervention only when it can be quickly 
and easily accomplished--has been criticized for moral obtuseness.  But the 
Powell Doctrine is in fact a good start.  The degree of difficulty of a 
humanitarian relief operation <i>must </i>be a criterion in making a 
decision, for if it is not, our misadventures will preclude intervention 
even when intervention would otherwise have been worthwhile.  The other 
criteria should be the strategic value of the place where we are 
considering intervening and the psychological weight that such an 
intervention might exert on other parts of the world.  Interventions in 
places and situations in which morality coincides with ease, strategic 
value, and leverage would meet what the military calls the parents' test: 
when a Pentagon official can stare a soldier's parents in the eye and tell 
them that their son or daughter died in the service of something worth 
dying for.  (There are situations in which the strategic value is 
significant but so is the difficulty--such as in the Balkans and on the 
Korean peninsula.  These places are historical legacies of sacrifices in 
three wars that saw great losses of American lives, and compared with which 
our historical involvement in a place like Liberia pales in significance.)  
In any case, here is <A 
HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/alumni/almag/kennan.html">George F. Kennan</A>, cautioning 
against intervention in Somalia--a warning that applies to other Third 
World states that have gone into the abyss.<p>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
The fact is that this dreadful situation cannot possibly be put to rights other
than by the establishment of a governing power for the entire territory, and a
very ruthless, determined one at that. It would not be a democratic one,
because the very pre-requisites for a democratic political system do not exist
among the people in question.

The framework outlined above accepts a certain amount of evil (diminished
concern for elections; a willingness in many cases to stand by and watch
atrocious situations without intervening) in order to pursue an attainable good
(low-risk, high-yield interventions only, and only on rare occasions; modest
but clear involvement in literacy and other bread-and-butter programs in places
where improvement is possible). We must stay engaged, but within strict limits.<p>

E has short hair and a long brown beard. He is wearing a three-piece suit. One
imagines him slumped over his desk, giggling helplessly. Pushed to one side is
an apparatus out of a junior-high science experiment: a beaker containing some
ammonium nitrate, a few inches of tubing, a cloth bag. Under one hand is a
piece of paper, on which he has written, "That sounds like nonsense but it is
pure <i>on </i>sense!" He giggles a little more. The writing trails away. He
holds his forehead in both hands. He is stoned. He is William James, the
American psychologist and philosopher. And for the first time he feels that he
is understanding religious mysticism.

<p>

The psychedelia of the 1960s was foreshadowed by events in the waning years 
of the nineteenth century.  This first American psychedelic movement began 
with <A HREF="wmjgist.htm">an anonymous article published in 1874 in <i>The 
Atlantic Monthly</i></A>.  The article, which was in fact written by James, 
reviewed <i>The Anaesthetic Revelation and the Gist of Philosophy</i>, a 
pamphlet arguing that the secrets of religion and philosophy were to be 
found in the rush of nitrous oxide intoxication.  Inspired by this thought, 
James experimented with the drug, experiencing extraordinary revelations 
that he immediately committed to paper.<p>


<blockquote>What's mistake but a kind of take?<br>

What's nausea but a kind of -ausea?<br>

Sober, drunk, -<i>unk </i>, astonishment. . . .<br>

Agreement--disagreement!! <br>

Emotion--motion!!! . . . <br>

Reconciliation of opposites; sober, drunk, all the same! <br>

Good and evil reconciled in a laugh! <br>

It escapes, it escapes! <br>

But--<br>

What escapes, WHAT escapes?</blockquote><p><br>

This experience, which in James's words involved "the strongest emotion" he had ever had, remained with him throughout
his life. <A HREF="http://www.nepenthes.xo.com/Drugs/N2O/jamesn2o.html">In 1882 he first described his experiments with the drug</A>; in 1898 he
published an article titled "Consciousness Under Nitrous Oxide" in the
<i>Psychological Review </i>; in 1902 he recounted the experience in his
greatest work, <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience </i>; and in 1910, in
the last essay he completed, he implied that nitrous oxide had had an abiding
influence on his thinking.<p>

When the drug wore off, James found that his mystical insights had disappeared.
What remained were incomprehensible words--"tattered fragments" that seemed
like "meaningless drivel." Being a philosophical visionary rather than a
garden-variety recreational drug user, however, James was not inclined to let
his sober consciousness have the final say. On the contrary, he took his
experiences with nitrous oxide as evidence that human life was more richly
varied than he had previously (and soberly) imagined. "Some years ago," he
wrote in <i>Varieties </i>, <p> 

<blockquote>I myself made some observations on . . . nitrous oxide
intoxication, and reported them in print. One conclusion was forced upon my
mind at that time, and my impression of its truth has ever since remained
unshaken. It is that our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as
we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it,
parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of
consciousness entirely different.</blockquote><p> 


For James, these alternate forms of consciousness were accessible only by way of artificial intoxicants. Others,
he hypothesized, were able to reach them without the aid of drugs: in his view
the great religious mystics, and certain mystical philosophers including Hegel,
were "unusually susceptible" to these extraordinary forms of consciousness.<p>

James's experiences with nitrous oxide helped to crystallize some of the major
tenets of his philosophy. His writings emphasize, for instance, the notion of
pluralism, according to which "to the very last, there are various 'points of
view' which the philosopher must distinguish in discussing the world." Nitrous
oxide had revealed in the most dramatic way possible the existence of alternate
points of view. Which was the "real" William James--the drug-addled visionary
who spouted meaningless mystical drivel, or the sober, unmystical psychologist
whose researches brought him international fame? James's philosophy was based
on the thought that the good life--for society and, by extension, for an
individual as well--involves a plurality of perspectives, of which the mystical
and the scientific are only two. Equally important to the mature Jamesian
outlook was the thought that religious experiences are <i>psychologically
real</i>--powerful and palpable events that can have important long-term
consequences <i>whether the beliefs to which they give rise are true or
not </i>. Drugs helped James to understand what religious belief was like from
the inside. When he took nitrous oxide, he was for all intents and purposes a
religious mystic. ("Thought deeper than speech!" he wrote while on the drug.
"Oh my God, oh God, oh God!") Nitrous oxide was the passport that allowed James
to see religion from the believer's perspective, traveling between the worlds
of science and faith.<p>

Yet James's experiments with nitrous oxide, when they have been noticed at all,
have been variously derided. Even in the nineteenth century, skeptical
scientists found his interest in exotic mental phenomena misguided, if not
reckless. Religious believers tend to resent the comparison of intoxication to
religious inspiration. Veterans of the counterculture, who have all had similar
if not more-intense drug revelations, tend to think of James as a dabbler.
These criticisms are shortsighted, and slight the fact that James was America's
first philosophical genius. Perhaps more than any philosopher before him, he
succeeded in combining the skepticism of the empirical scientist, the form of
consciousness that "diminishes, discriminates, and says no," with the hyperbole
of the mystical visionary, the form of consciousness that "expands, unites, and
says yes." If drugs helped him to open the doors of consciousness in this
welcoming way, perhaps we should rethink some of our assumptions about drug use
and its possible role in human life. For example, can drugs play a role in
authentic religious experience? And if so, what should be the legal and moral
status of religious drug use? <p>

These questions lead into a fascinating tangle of history and philosophy, much
of which has surprising relevance to contemporary policy. Indeed, for more than
thirty years courts, legislatures, and philosophers have been debating James's
questions, reaching a bewildering variety of incompatible conclusions. Some
courts have held that religious drug use is legitimate and even deserves
constitutional protection; others--including the Supreme Court--have rejected
these arguments. In 1993 Congress passed a law allowing for the sacramental use
of peyote, a powerful hallucinogen; yet politicians continue to excoriate "drug
use," as if "drugs" were a single sort of unequivocally bad thing. (One wonders
how many of the congressional representatives who passed the peyote law would
be willing to acknowledge publicly their support for hallucinogenic drug use.)
William James thought more clearly about these issues than we are able to think
today, and we may want to look to James as we consider the place of drugs in
contemporary life.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC1">An
"Adamic" Revelation
</a></h3><p>

JAMES'S interest in nitrous oxide was prompted by a man named Benjamin Paul
Blood. Born in 1832, Blood --a farmer, philosopher, athletic strongman,
prodigious calculator, debunker, inventor, mystic, and forgotten visionary, and
the author of the pamphlet <i>The Anaesthetic Revelation and the Gist of
Philosophy </i>--is a classic figure of nineteenth-century America. By his own
confession an idler, a "fraud," haphazardly educated and with little gift for
sustained argument, Blood spent his eighty-six years in Amsterdam, a town in
upstate New York. But despite his limitations, or perhaps because of them, he
devoted his life to philosophy. The bulk of his writing consists of letters to
the editors of local papers: the Amsterdam <i>Gazette </i>and <i>Recorder </i>,
the <i>Utica Herald </i>, the <i>Albany Times </i>. (Some of these letters were
amalgamated for the <i>Journal of Speculative Philosophy </i>.) He published a
few poems in <i>Scribner's Magazine </i>. Eventually he wrote a book,
<i>Pluriverse: An Essay in the Philosophy of Pluralism </i>.<p>

Blood could multiply large numbers in his head. He could demolish the itinerant
lecturers who were a staple of nineteenth-century American popular culture. On
one occasion he demonstrated to an astonished crowd how a visiting spiritualist
had produced apparently ghostly occurrences. On another he used the doctrines
of what was then called modern philosophy to challenge an astronomer's
glorification of space: Why, he asked, should we be impressed by the size of
the solar system if size is relative to the perceiver? Would not a giant find
the universe small? And is it not, therefore, <i>we</i> who make space large,
since without us it would be neither large nor small? Amsterdam was not always
up to these speculations, but it loved Blood nonetheless. Bewildered newspaper
editors cheerfully printed his grandiose contributions. Townspeople spoke in
admiring terms of Blood's letters from such luminaries as Ralph Waldo Emerson,
Grover Cleveland, and William James. And, as Blood was not above mentioning, in
a poll conducted by one of the local papers he placed as "one of the twelve
leading citizens" of the town--number six, to be precise.<p>

The outside world, however, was less kind. The portentous letters Blood
directed to innumerable nineteenth-century eminentos were for the most part met
with polite dismissal. One appeal, it is true, produced an invitation to visit
Alfred Lord Tennyson; another resulted in a lengthy and affectionate
correspondence with James. But in the main Blood lived his long life alone.
Thumbing through the detritus of his "papers," the inconsequential letters and
crumbling newspaper clippings that some admirer deposited in Harvard's Houghton
Library, one catches the unmistakable whiff of intellectual tragedy. Blood was
the very picture of the half-baked American eccentric, a snake-oil salesman
with philosophical pretensions. Born in the wrong place and at the wrong time,
he knew too little to put his talents to good use, and too much to let them
atrophy gracefully.<p>

Blood's obsession with <A HREF="http://www.paranoia.com/drugs/nitrous/">nitrous oxide</A> began at a dentist's office. Nitrous
oxide, or "laughing gas," had been discovered in 1772 by Joseph Priestley. Its
distinctive psychoactive properties were noticed twenty-seven years later by
Sir Humphrey Davy, whose <i>Researches, Chemical and Philosophical, Chiefly
Concerning Nitrous Oxide, or Dephlogisticated Nitrous Air, and Its
Respiration</i> records a series of attempts to try to find a use for the new
drug. Notwithstanding Davy's efforts,<A 
HREF="http://www.resort.com/~banshee/Info/N2O/nitrous.users.html">the drug was used in the early half of
the century primarily for recreation</A>. One nineteenth-century observer wrote
that ether, which has similar psychoactive properties, had "long been the toy
of professors and students," and noted that "the students at Cambridge
[Harvard] used to inhale sulphuric ether from their handkerchiefs, and that it
intoxicated them, making them reel and stagger." Ether was first put to its
modern use in 1846, when, in one of the major triumphs of nineteenth-century
medicine, W.T.G. Morton, an American dentist, "administered the vapor of
sulphuric ether to a patient, and extracted a tooth, the patient being in a
state of entire insensibility." A similar result followed shortly thereafter
with nitrous oxide, and the modern practice of anesthesia was born.<p>

Enter Blood. In the preface to his book, <i>Pluriverse</i>, he wrote,<p>

<blockquote>It was in the year 1860 that there came to me, through the
necessary [medical] use of anaesthetics, a Revelation or insight of the
immemorial Mystery which among enlightened peoples still persists as the
philosophical secret or problem of the world. . . . After fourteen years of
this experience at varying intervals, I published in 1874 "The Anaesthetic
Revelation and the Gist of Philosophy," not assuming to define therein the
purport of the illumination, but rather to signalize the experience, and in a
r&eacute;sum&eacute; of philosophy to show wherein that had come short of it.
</blockquote><p> 

Blood held that the great metaphysical philosophers, from Plato to
Hegel, had all experienced something like what he had experienced while on
nitrous oxide. This "anaesthetic revelation," he argued, was "primordial,"
"Adamic," and incommunicable. He wrote to James, "Philosophy is past. It was
the long endeavor to logicize what we can only realize practically or in
immediate experience."<p>

Tireless proselytizing on behalf of his pamphlet--Blood sent copies to
virtually everyone he could think of--eventually resulted in the formation of a
tiny group of nitrous oxide philosophers, who agreed that the drug produced
some sort of incommunicable metaphysical illumination. One was Xenos Clark, a
philosopher who died young in Amherst, Massachusetts. (His last days were spent
collecting his writings on the "anaesthetic revelation," which he asked James
to transmit to posterity.) Other experimenters included some impressive
figures: Edmund Gurney, an English spiritualist who had written a heavy
two-volume catalogue of telepathic events, hauntings, and other ghostly
occurrences (<i>Phantasms of the Living</i>, 1886); J. A. Symonds, the poet,
historian, and biographer; Professor William Ramsay, a 1904 Nobel laureate and
the discoverer of the inert gases; and, of course, William James. All reported
"metaphysical insights" under the influence of nitrous oxide or similar drugs.
Even Tennyson, while he was recovering from an experience with ether, blurted
out "a long metaphysical term"--unfortunately not recorded.<p>

Many of these figures were associated with the British Society for Psychical
Research. Founded in 1882, the society (which still exists) aimed to test with
an unbiased, scientific eye reports of a wide variety of unusual experiences
not recognized by the academic establishment. Its province was what we would
now call parapsychology: claims of hauntings, telepathy, spontaneous mental
healings, visions of the dead, and other supernatural occurrences. Members
conducted research, collected reports of paranormal activity, and published a
journal. Blood's claim--that nitrous oxide reliably produced the experience of
metaphysical illumination--engaged the society, and its members immediately
set about to verify or disprove it.<p>

James was attracted to the society by its peculiar mixture of scientific
caution and romantic optimism. The son of a <A HREF="http://www.netaxs.com/~mvd/ES/">Swedenborgian</A>, James was
permanently suspended between the poles of faith and reason. Although he was
uncomfortable with his father's visionary excess, he was scandalized by the
neglect of this very quality on the part of the more reputable sciences. He
wrote in "What Psychical Research Has Accomplished," <p>  

<blockquote>No part of the unclassified residuum [of human experience] has
usually been treated with a more contemptuous scientific disregard than the
mass of phenomena generally called <i>mystical</i>. Physiology will have
nothing to do with them. Orthodox psychology turns its back on them. Medicine
sweeps them out; or, at most, when in an anecdotal vein, records a few of them
as "effects of the imagination"--a phrase of mere dismissal, whose meaning, in
this connection, it is impossible to make precise. All the while, however, the
phenomena are there, lying broadcast over the surface of
history.</blockquote><p>  

James even went so far as to compare this disregard to
that of a religious believer who refuses to acknowledge scientific
considerations that weigh against his or her cause: "Certain of our positivists
keep chiming to us that, amid the wreck of every other god and idol, one
divinity still stands upright,--that his name is Scientific Truth, and that he
has but one commandment, but that one supreme, saying, <i>Thou shalt not be a
theist</i>." James wanted a more radical empiricism, a science freed of
preconceptions, for which the issue of religious belief had not been foreclosed
ahead of the evidence.<p>

It was Blood, more than any other single figure, who embodied this attitude.
James's final published essay, "A Pluralist Mystic," was a sustained encomium
of Amsterdam's finest philosopher. Blood's work, he wrote, "fascinated me so
'weirdly' that I am conscious of its having been one of the stepping-stones of
my thinking ever since." Blood gave James confidence that empirical and
mystical sympathies could be combined. James wrote, <p>  

<blockquote>One cannot criticize the vision of a mystic--one can but pass it
by, or else accept it as having some amount of evidential weight. I felt unable
to do either with a good conscience until I met with Mr. Blood. . . . I confess
that the existence of this novel brand of mysticism has made my cowering mood
depart. </blockquote><p>  

Blood's was a "pluralist mysticism" because it presented
his extraordinary mystical experiences simply <i>as</i> experiences, without
chaining them to a grand systematic doctrine such as Christianity or Hegelian
philosophy. Moreover, it provided others with a key to those experiences,
nitrous oxide, with which they could test Blood's claims in controlled and
scientific surroundings. It was, in short, a mysticism without dogma or
conclusions--just the thing for a Harvard professor with strong religious
sympathies.<p>
<pre>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC2">Did
Religion Begin With Drugs?
</a></h3><p>

DRUGS have long been associated with religion. Psychedelic mushrooms were used
in Siberia more than 6,000 years ago. The ceremonial use of marijuana among the
Scythians dates back almost 2,500 years. Haoma, a sacred drink of the
Zoroastrians, and soma, an early Hindu analogue, are both presumed to have been
made from psychedelic plants; scriptural references to the drinking of "sacred
urine" have led some historians to propose that the plants in question may have
included the <i>Amanita muscaria </i>mushroom, whose active ingredient passes
into urine without a significant loss of potency. The ancient Greek cult of
Dionysus used wine to provoke visions, and other Greek mystery cults may have
used psychoactive substances. (The use of wine in Christian rituals may be a
remnant of similar practices.) In the New World the religious use of
psychedelic mushrooms has been widely practiced--among the Mayans, in the Aztec
empire, and today, by many members of the Native American Church. In view of
this extensive transcultural association between religion and drug use, at
least one scholar--R. Gordon Wasson, an authority on mushroom cults--has
proposed that the religious impulse itself originated with drugs, as a confused
reaction to intense experiences provoked by the accidental ingestion of
psychoactive plants. <p>

James's interest in the connection between drugs and religion was unusual in
one crucial respect. Unlike other drug-using mystics, he did not see drugs as a
means to understanding higher religious truths; on the contrary, he used drugs
because they provided him with access to beliefs that were potentially
<i>false</i>. At the time of his experiments with nitrous oxide James thought
that religion, though it might be based on untruth from the scientific point of
view, was nevertheless good for one. It had survival value: in the long run
religion helped human beings to live rich and happy lives. In "Is Life Worth
Living?" he offered the analogy of a mountain climber who is stuck in a tight
place. <p>  

<blockquote>
 Suppose, for instance, that you are climbing a mountain, and have worked
yourself into a position from which the only escape is by a terrible leap. Have
faith that you can successfully make it, and your feet are nerved to its
accomplishment. But mistrust yourself, and think of all the sweet things you
have heard the scientists say of <i>maybes</i>, and you will
hesitate so long that, at last, all unstrung and trembling, and launching
yourself in a moment of despair, you roll in the abyss. </blockquote> <p> 


This analogy, which emphasizes belief's potential usefulness rather than its
truth, is utterly characteristic of James, a man who arrived at philosophy by
way of medicine and psychology rather than physical science and logic.<p>

At the age of twenty-eight James had fallen into a period of deep depression.
Unable to see his way around the determinism of his materialist friends, he
felt pessimistic, not just about the possibility of human freedom in a world of
physical laws but also about his own aptitude for philosophy. The death of a
favorite cousin, coupled with repeated bouts of physical illness, exacerbated
his situation. Finally came a crisis. One night, walking into a darkened room,
James had a sudden hallucinatory vision: a young man he had once seen, a
patient at a mental hospital, black-haired, with "greenish" skin, sitting on a
bench against the wall, his legs pressed up against his chest, moving only his
eyes. "<i>That shape am I</i>," James wrote: a powerless waif, observing a
world he could not change. After this, he said, "the universe changed
entirely." He began to wake up each morning with dread in his stomach. For
months he was afraid to go into the dark alone. Concealing his condition from
the people around him, James quietly contemplated suicide.<p>

Over the next few months his melancholia faded somewhat. Then, on April 30,
1870, a dam burst.<p>  
<blockquote>I think yesterday was a crisis in my life. I finished the first
part of Renouvier's 2nd Essay and saw no reason why his definition of free
will--"the sustaining of a thought <i>because I choose to</i> when I might have
other thoughts"--need be the definition of an illusion. At any rate I will
assume for the present--until next year--that it is no illusion. My first act
of free will shall be to believe in free will. For the remainder of the year, I
will abstain from the mere speculation &amp; contemplative [meditation] in
which my nature takes most delight, and voluntarily cultivate the feeling of
moral freedom, by reading books favorable to it, as well as by
acting.</blockquote><p>  

James chose to believe in free will not because he thought
it was true but because it was necessary to his well-being. Like the mountain
climber facing a life-or-death jump, he simply screwed up his courage and told
himself that he was free. "In such a case," James wrote about the mountain
climber, "(and it belongs to an enormous class) the part of wisdom as well as
of courage is to <i>believe what is in the line of your needs</i>, for only by
such belief is the need fulfilled."<p>

James's career involved a progressive generalization of this thought. What
began as a simple, almost physical necessity--a personal need to believe in
free will in order to escape crushing moral paralysis--blossomed into a
full-fledged philosophical doctrine. Beliefs, James eventually decided, were
adaptations, like the giraffe's long neck or the tiger's claws: they were
justifiable only insofar as they helped people to get around in the world. To
believe what one needed to believe was no mere sign of weakness, as some of
James's contemporaries contended. Rather, it showed a healthy understanding of
what the process of believing was all about. In particular James argued that we
are not obligated to be determinists, atheists, or materialists just because
science might say that those are the correct and true doctrines. Ultimately
science itself should be evaluated in terms of a higher moral question: To what
extent are scientific beliefs conducive to human happiness?<p>

<pre>
</pre>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC3">Positive
Illusions
</a></h3><p>

SOME remarkable work by psychologists has recently illuminated James's
position. Lyn Abramson, of the University of Wisconsin, and Lauren Alloy, of
Temple University, have uncovered a number of "cognitive illusions" to which
normal, healthy people are subject. Emotional health, they suggest, involves
mildly overoptimistic presumptions and a corresponding insensitivity to
failure, which result in a propensity to make straightforwardly false
judgments. Perversely, the clinically depressed are often free of these
cognitive illusions--they are, to use the subtitle of one of Abramson and
Alloy's best-known papers, "Sadder But Wiser." Likewise, Shelley Taylor, a
social psychologist, has studied the use of illusions by victims of trauma and
illness. She found that like James's mountaineer, those who are unjustifiably
optimistic tend to live better-adjusted and happier lives than people faced
with similar situations who are thoroughly realistic about their prospects.
(Taylor's book, <i>Positive Illusions</i>, provides an introduction to the
subject of useful falsehoods.) Finally, Daniel Goleman, the author of <i>Vital
Lies, Simple Truths</i>, and other neo-Freudians have argued that repression,
the forgetting of unpleasant facts, plays a crucial role in emotional health.
Overall, the psychological consensus seems to be that there can be a reasonably
widespread conflict between truth and happiness. The best beliefs, as James
clearly intuited, are by no means the truest ones. (Toward the end of his life
James came to use "true" almost as a synonym for "useful," but the early James
had not yet taken this radical step.)<p>

James's life was filled with eloquent demonstrations, both large and small, of
this principle. Testifying before the Massachusetts legislature, in 1898, he
opposed a bill that would have prohibited Christian Scientists from practicing
their "mind-cures." "You are not to ask yourselves whether these mind-curers
really achieve the successes that are claimed," he told the lawmakers. "It is
enough for you as legislators to ascertain that a large number of our citizens
. . . are persuaded that a valuable new department of medical experience is by
them opening up." On a more mundane level James supported the philosopher
Charles Sanders Peirce, his friend and mentor, with money that was from his own
pocket but that James claimed had been collected from Peirce's many "anonymous
admirers." This was an ordinary white lie, but in the context of James's
lifelong concern for the practical consequences of belief it resonates with
unusual grandeur. James's genius can be described as an unwillingness to
overlook the numerous instances of benign deception (and self-deception) that
mark human life. With inspired audacity he suggested a link between these banal
little deceptions and the grand, useful, and possibly false world views that
characterize religious belief.<p>

James's interest in drugs needs to be seen in this light. Although as a
philosopher James preached the "will to believe," as a man he was not always
able to put this idea into practice. Without nitrous oxide he was a cautious
scientist whose skeptical nature prevented him from experiencing the religious
joys that his philosophy celebrated. "My own constitution," he said, speaking
of mystical experiences, "shuts me out from their enjoyment almost entirely."
With the drug he became an inspired visionary whose rantings would surely turn
a Beat poet green with envy.<p>

Drugs, in short, gave James the theorist who dared people to believe what accorded with their needs
the ability to do just that.

<a name="RTFToC4">The
Freedom to Believe
</a></h3><p>

 AMERICANS, it is often remarked, are confused about drugs. The image of
William Bennett giving up his cigarettes in order to lead the nation's
War on Drugs exemplifies this confusion. We tolerate cigarettes and alcohol but
prohibit the recreational use of similarly mild intoxicants, including
marijuana. We pour billions of dollars into law enforcement but devote only a
tiny fraction of this amount to the medical treatment and rehabilitation of
drug addicts. Courts impose widely disparate punishments for the possession and
use of chemically similar substances, notably crack and powdered cocaine. But
perhaps the most egregious area of inconsistency involves religious drug use.
Faced with the claim that drug use contributes importantly to religious belief,
courts have made a number of confused and conflicting judgments.<p>

In 1964 the California Supreme Court held that members of the Native American
Church, an association of Native American groups all of whom use peyote in
their religious rituals, had a First Amendment right to use the drug. In
subsequent years <A 
HREF="http://www.paranoia.com/drugs/war.on.drugs/debate/peyote.speech">the Native American Church obtained religious exemption from
peyote restrictions</A> in twenty-seven other states, though in a few instances,
notably in a case before the Oregon Supreme Court, its arguments were rejected.
Meanwhile, non-Native American requests for religious exemption from drug
statutes have repeatedly been denied--including those of the Neo-American
Church, which in 1968 claimed 20,000 members; the Universal Church of Christ
Light, which used marijuana in its rituals; the Church of the Awakening,
founded in 1963 by two retired osteopaths; the Native American Church of New
York (of whose 1,000 members only a few were in fact Native Americans); Timothy
Leary; and the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, a syncretic Jamaican group.
Finally, in 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the claim that the First
Amendment protected the Native American Church's use of peyote--in part, no
doubt, because of the obvious double standard that was being applied. Congress
retaliated in 1993 with the <A HREF="http://northshore.shore.net/rf/theact.html">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</A>, in effect
reinstating both the Native American Church's right to use drugs in its
religious rituals and the disturbing double standard.<p>

The reasoning behind decisions that uphold the right to use drugs in a
religious context is obvious: drugs play an important, even essential, role in
the practice of many religious groups; the Constitution protects the free
exercise of religious belief; therefore the Constitution protects the use of
drugs. The reasoning behind decisions that reject the same right is that
religious action, unlike religious belief, is not absolutely protected by the
Constitution. The distinction was definitively articulated by Justice Owen
Roberts in <i>Cantwell</i> v. <i>Connecticut</i> (1940). "The [First]
Amendment," he wrote, "embraces two concepts--freedom to believe and freedom to
act. The first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the second cannot be."
Thus the law, though it does not seek to prevent people from having certain
religious beliefs, may prevent them from acting on those beliefs. Courts have
held, for instance, that prohibitions on polygamy apply to Mormons, and that
even Christian snake-handling sects are subject to regulations controlling the
treatment of dangerous animals. Since taking drugs is an action, it is thus
subject to government regulation.<p>

But is this the right way to look at the situation? William James used drugs
not because he had religious beliefs that encouraged him to do so but in order
to <i>generate</i> religious or mystical beliefs that he otherwise would not
have had. <p>  

<blockquote>Looking back on my own experiences [with nitrous oxide], they all
converge towards a kind of insight to which I cannot help ascribing some
metaphysical significance. The keynote of it is invariably a reconciliation. It
is as if the opposites of the world, whose contradictoriness and conflict make
all our difficulties and troubles, were melted into unity. . . . This is a dark
saying, I know, when thus expressed in terms of common logic, but I cannot
wholly escape from its authority. I feel as if it must mean something,
something like what the hegelian philosophy means, if one could only lay hold
of it more clearly. Those who have ears to hear, let them hear; <i>to me the
living sense of its reality only comes in the artificial mystic state of
mind</i>. [Italics added.]</blockquote><p>  

If we take this claim seriously, and if we also take seriously Justice Roberts's assertion that the "freedom to
believe" is absolute, then we need to rethink the prevailing consensus about
religious drug use. Taking drugs is an action, certainly, but actions that are
necessary for the <i>production</i> of religious beliefs should not be
conflated with actions taken <i>because of </i>religious beliefs that
could exist regardless. James needed nitrous oxide in order to have his
mystical belief. Did he then have a constitutional right to use the drug? Just
how absolute is the freedom to believe?<p>

More important, James's philosophy gives us a principled way to think
about the relation between religion and drugs. From a Jamesian perspective,
religious toleration represents not just a commitment to individual freedom,
not simply a hands-off policy on the part of the government toward questions of
ultimate truth, but rather an affirmative decision to shelter certain useful
though potentially false beliefs. Drug use, from this perspective, represents a
similar sort of decision, but on the level of the individual rather than of the
society. Just as a society might choose to nurture or tolerate certain sorts of
illusions, pluralistically embracing both atheistic and religious subcultures,
so, too, might an individual decide--as did James--to divide his or her life
into periods of sober rationality and ecstatic religious intoxication. Drugs
can allow even the most skeptical people, those who by constitution or
upbringing are not susceptible to religious insights, to experience temporary
periods of pleasing falsehood. Indeed, this is the real religious significance
of drug use, from the Jamesian point of view--that it lets us choose, if only
vaguely and temporarily, what to believe.<p>

In 1977 Judge Jack Weinstein, of New York State, wrote,<p>  
<blockquote>Neither the trappings of robes, nor temples of stone, nor a fixed
liturgy, nor an extensive literature or history is required to meet the test of
beliefs cognizable under the Constitution as religious. So far as our law is
concerned, one person's religious beliefs held for one day are presumptively
entitled to the same protection as the beliefs of millions which have been
shared for thousands of years. </blockquote><p>  

These are generous words, and they should make us ask whether James's beliefs--held not for a day but for the mere
minutes of his intoxication--warrant comparable charity. Can we learn to look
at drug-induced illusion with enthusiastic Jamesian innocence? Is not the
degree of self-control that pharmacology has given us remarkable? Prozac
promises to change the hand that chemistry has dealt us, altering our moods to
suit our needs. For James, drugs served a similar function: using nitrous
oxide, he altered the beliefs that science had given him, experiencing if only
for a brief time the pleasing illusions of the religious visionary.<p>

Drugs, of course, are dangerous. They can destroy lives, families, and even
whole communities. (James's own brother Robertson fought a long and losing
battle with alcoholism.) The story of William James shows us how drugs can also
contribute to human well-being, fulfilling in some instances an authentic
religious need. Of course, our political culture is unprepared to recognize
this. No doubt our courts will for the foreseeable future continue to deny that
seekers like James might have a compelling religious interest in the use of
drugs. Our politicians will continue to make perhaps unnaturally sharp
distinctions: between the pleasing illusions of religious belief and those of
intoxication; between the Native American's peyote and the non-Native
American's nitrous oxide. A century after William James we have yet to catch up
with him and his intoxicated nonsense.

	<font size=5>W</font>hat we are, we are! Fear not, gentle reader, we are only thus beginning to
give you a brief account of The Anaesthetic Revelation, a privately printed
pamphlet which its author has sent us. What we are, we are, whether we be aware
of it or not! The stuff of which we and our universe are made cannot be helped
by knowledge. Her use is to forestall contingencies; but in Being nothing is
contingent. It shall be what is always was; whether for weal or woe its inmost
equality or meaning IS already, nor can all our complacent recognition confirm
or clinch it, "or all our tears wash out a word of it." This utterance of
practical sense has helped to bring the metaphysical craving into disrepute, as
being a morbid overgrowth of intellectual activity; whilst more subtle reasons
still are making some minds condemn it as an essentially hopeless passion.
Among these latter stands Mr. Blood, who, however, frees himself from
philosophy only as many others have done, by wading deeply through, and thereby
exposing himself to the scornful eyes of the sound-minded and practical crew as
one of the other visionary sort. More indeed than visionary,--crack-brained,
will be the verdict of most readers, when they hear that he has found a
mystical substitute for the answer which philosophy seeks; and that this
substitute is the sort of ontological intuition, beyond the power of words to
tell of, which one experiences while taking nitrous oxide gas and other
anaesthetics. "After experiments ranging over nearly fourteen years, I affirm
what any man may prove at will, that there is an invariable and reliable
condition (or uncondition) ensuing about the instant of recall from anaesthetic
stupor to sensible observation, or 'coming to,' IN WHICH THE GENIUS OF BEING IS
REVEALED; but because it cannot be remembered in the normal condition, it is
lost altogether through the infrequency of anaesthetic treatment in any
individual's case ordinarily, and buried amid the hum of returning
common-sense, under that epitaph of all illumination, This is a queer
world!...To minds of sanguine imagination, there will be a sadness in the tenor
of the mystery, as if the key-note of the universe were low,--for no poetry, no
emotion known to the normal sanity of man, can furnish a hint of its primeval
prestige and its all but appalling solemnity; but for such as have felt sadly
the instability of temporal things, there is a comfort of serenity and ancient
peace; while for the resolved and imperious spirit there are majesty and
supremacy unspeakable." So glorious does this solution of the world's mystery
seem to him, that he rises to this flight of rhetoric, which will seem grand or
funny according to the disposition of the reader: "My worldly tribulation
reclines on its divine composure; and though not in haste to die, I care not to
be dead, but look into the future with serene and changeless cheer. This world
is no more that alien terror which was taught me. Spurning the cloud-grimed and
still sultry battlements whence so lately Jehovan thunders boomed, my gray gull
lifts her wing against the night-fall and takes the dim leagues with a fearless
eye."<p>

<p>

Now, although we are more than skeptical of the importance of Mr. Blood's
so-called discovery, we shall not howl with the wolves or join the multitude in
jeering at it. Nirwana, whether called by that name or not, has been conceived
and represented as the consummation of life too often not to have some meaning;
and the state without discrimination, the "informal consciousness," the "being
in a meaning prior to and deeper than manifestation in form" of our author
seems to be the same as nirwana. Every one has felt the proverb, "In vino
veritas," to have a deeper meaning than the common interpretation, that the
mask falls from the drinker's character. Ontological emotion, however stumbled
on, has something authoritative for the individual who feels it. But the worst
of all mystical or simply personal knowledge is incommunicability. To the mere
affirmation, "I KNOW that this is truth, therefore believe it!" the still more
simple reply, "I won't!" is legitimate and conclusive for the time. The
intellect, with its classifications and roundabout substitutions, must after
all be clung to as the only organ of agreement between men. But when a man
comes forward with a mystical experience of his own, the duty of the intellect
towards it is not suppression but interpretation. Interpretation of the
phenomenon Mr. Blood describes is yet deficient. But we may be sure of one
thing now: that even on the hypothesis of its containing all the "revelation"
he asserts, laughing-gas intoxication would not be the final way of getting at
that revelation. What blunts the mind and weakens the will is no full channel
for truth, even if it assist us to a view of a certain aspect of it; and
mysticism versus mysticism, the faith that comes of willing, the intoxication
of moral volition, has a million times better credentials.<p>

<p>

The greater part of the pamphlet, in which he ratiocinatively explains the gist
of all philosophy to be its own insufficiency to comprehend or in any way state
the All, is marked by acuteness of thought and often great felicity of style;
though it sins by obscurity through a quaint density of expression, and by such
verbal monsters as spacical instead of spatial. We can enter into it no further
than to say that the common run of believers in the "relativity" of knowledge,
who feel as if the imbecility of the latter were due to its bounds and not to
its essence (which is to duplicate Being in an Other, namely, Thought), will
find here the view argued interestingly that the trouble all comes of a
gratuitous guest; that the mystery we feel challenged to resolve, and baffled
at not resolving, is not mystery if we decline the challenge; in other words,
that fullness of life (unreflected on) forestalls the need of philosophy by
being in itself "what we must confess as practical somewhere, namely, an apodal
sufficiency; to which sufficiency a wonder or fear of why it is sufficient
cannot pertain, and could be attributed to it only as an impossible disease or
lack." The secret of Being, in short, is not the dark immensity beyond
knowledge, but at home, this side, beneath the feet, and overlooked by
knowledge. We sincerely advise real students of philosophy to write for the
pamphlet to its author. It is by no means as important as he probably believes
it, but still thoroughly original and very suggestive.

<blockquote>
	
<font size=5>F</font>OR centuries Ireland has produced far more great 
writers than any country of its size deserved to, but literature seems to 
have exhausted Irish creativity.  There are very few famous Irish painters 
(though I am fond of Daniel Maclise, Nathaniel Hone, and Jack B.  Yeats, 
the brother of the more famous W.  B.), and classical music in Ireland has 
been a thin business.  True, Handel's <I>Messiah</I> was first performed in 
<A HREF="http://touchtel.iol.ie:8080/first/dcity.htm">Dublin</A>, but 
that's one of those curiosities with which the tediously well-informed 
music lover can win bets--like the fact that Verdi's <I>La forza del 
destino</I> was first performed in St. Petersburg or Stravinsky's <I>The 
Rake's Progress</I> at La Fenice in Venice (bitterly mourned as I write).  
Since Handel's day Ireland has had no permanent opera company and, for that 
matter, no proper symphony orchestra, until recently.<p>

And so a half century ago an Irish provincial town seemed about the most 
unlikely and unpropitious place in Europe to start an opera festival.  
Something as unlikely as that needs a visionary or a crackpot.  <A 
HREF="http://touchtel.iol.ie:8080/cgi-win/imap32.exe/eire1?278,269">Wexford</A> 
had Doctor Tom.  T.  J.  Walsh was born in Wexford in 1911, and having 
qualified as a doctor in Dublin, returned to his home town to practice.  
There he stayed until he died, in 1988, just short of his seventy-seventh 
birthday, laden with honors and love.  He is still missed.<P>

He would be missed if he had been only a good doctor and a good man. But 
Doctor Tom was also an opera buff, who  decided that his town should have 
its own opera festival. There have been other improbable venues for opera, 
from Montepulciano, in the Tuscan hills, to Cooperstown, in upstate New 
York, but I don't think there can ever have been such an odd idea as 
Doctor Tom's. Wexford had never been notable as a cultural center. It is a 
pleasant little country town in the far southeast of Ireland, rising 
imposingly above the estuary of the Slaney River. Two grand 
Victorian-Gothic churches dominate it, above a warren of narrow streets 
and alleys running down to the quay. <P>

Having also decided that if Wexford was to have a festival, it needed an 
opera house, Doctor Tom serendipitously found the Theatre Royal, a 
delightful Georgian building on High Street. Despite its name, the street 
is about twenty feet wide, and despite <I>its</I>, the theater is a little 
gem that at first held fewer than 400 people and even now, after discreet 
enlargement, holds only 550. The theater was disused for generations, but 
under Doctor Tom's direction it was cleared out and tidied up, and an 
opera was put on.<P>

That was in 1951. A mostly Irish cast was assembled, along with what was 
then the Radio Eireann Light Orchestra, for a few performances of <I>The 
Rose of Castile</I>, by Michael Balfe, a nineteenth-century Irish composer 
with Wexford connections, before tiny audiences. Over the next few years 
the festival presented operas by Donizetti, Bellini, and Rossini--most 
of them then rarely heard, though some now standard repertory. But by the 
1960s Wexford had acquired its unique mission: finding fine but 
little-known artists to perform operas that even the buffest of buffs know 
only as names from reference books.<P>
<br>

<font size=5>T</font>HE first year I went was 1969, when Wexford did Haydn's <I>L'infedelta 
delusa</I> and Verdi's <I>Luisa Miller</I>, and with rare exceptions the 
eighty or so operas I've heard in the Theatre Royal have been pieces I 
didn't know before and haven't come upon since. Forgotten works are often 
forgotten with good reason. I don't think I shall mind not hearing Ricci's 
<I>La serva e l'ussero</I> or Lalo's <I>Le roi d'Ys</I> again. And a 
double bill of <I>Don Giovanni</I> and <I>Turandot</I>--Gazzaniga's 
<I>Don Giovanni</I> <I>Tenorio</I> and Busoni's 
<I>Turandot</I>--seemed a little too cute. But there have also been 
some real discoveries, operas worth the journey in themselves: Massenet's 
<I>H&eacute;rodiade</I>, say, and Dvor&aacute;k's <I>The Devil and 
Kate</I>.<P>

Wexford began as an amateur--maybe even amateurish--affair. Doctor 
Tom was the amateur artistic director until 1966. But the word "amateur" 
comes from a word for "love," and Wexford is run <I>con amore</I>. Again, 
productions vary. Every year there seems to be one good, one painful, and 
one brilliant production. The first night of Spontini's <I>La vestale</I> 
in 1979 was a memorable fiasco: a sharply sloping stage had been 
inadvertently cleaned of its intentionally sticky surface, and in the 
first act the singers tried to sing while sliding downhill or falling 
over. Sad to say, it was terribly funny, if not for the singers or the 
director. But it was also at Wexford that I first saw the stellar work of 
very young directors who have since become internationally famous: David 
Pountney, who recently directed Philip Glass's <I>The Voyage</I> at the 
Met, and Nicholas Hytner, who could have retired on the proceeds of 
<I>Miss Saigon</I> but who has instead gone on to direct <I>The Madness of 
King George</I>, among other works.<P>

Musical standards have always been remarkable at Wexford. What was long 
the orchestra of RTE, the Irish broadcasting company, and is now the Irish 
National Symphony Orchestra, doesn't have the fame (or the money) of the 
Berliners or the Viennese, but it is damned good. No artist goes to 
Wexford for the fees, but it is a career showcase, and the management is 
always looking for good singers who aren't yet megastars. The bright light 
of the early seventies was the delicious Martiniquan soprano Christiane 
Eda-Pierre, and of the early eighties the Russian baritone Sergei 
Leiferkus, who made his Western debut at Wexford before going on to 
international stardom.<P>

At least one operatic marriage was made at Wexford: the English tenor 
Philip Langridge and the Irish mezzo Ann Murray met in Cavalli's 
<I>Eritrea</I>.  That was also the year when most of the tenors in the 
chorus were energetically gay.  One Wexford landlady was heard to complain, 
"I've nothing against them boys, but would you listen to the clatterin' and 
crashin' upstairs--and now the Pope's fallen from off the wall!" which 
became a company catchphrase for the whole season.  Wexford is like that: 
not crashing tenors or falling Popes but a company, like <A 
HREF="http://www.uktw.co.uk/gto.html">Glyndebourne</A> in England, that 
comes together for several intense weeks, with its own romances, scandals, 
and jokes, and also with a spirit that shows on stage.<P>

It's precisely this quality that explains why, for some of us, Wexford has 
become the best-loved event on the musical calendar.  Festivals begun by 
true enthusiasts almost always atrophy, as artistic sclerosis is 
accompanied by social opulence.  <A 
HREF="http://www.salzb-fest.co.at/salzb-fest/index_e.html">Salzburg</A> is 
the prime case: once a great artistic event, now a place that gives vulgar 
cosmopolitan plutocracy a bad name.  If you can manage to get a $200-plus 
ticket, you may just hear the music above the rustle of furs and the clank 
of jewelry.<P>

<br>

<font size=5>T</font>O be sure, Wexford itself has changed in the years I have known it: the 
town, the audience, and the festival. It isn't easy to convey, or even 
remember, just how parochial and impoverished rural Ireland was as late as 
the 1960s. Since then it has become much more prosperous, a prosperity 
visible in the shopping streets and just about every other part of town. 
The audience now includes more visitors from outside the British Isles, 
and among the local attenders there is less evidence of the "West Brits" 
or the Anglo-Irish, and more of Dublin's own new class, affluent and 
confident business folk and professionals.<P>

The repertory is still delightfully recondite: next October, Donizetti's 
<I>Parisina</I>, Meyerbeer's <I>L'&eacute;toile du nord</I>, and Fibich's 
<I>S&aacute;rka</I> (no, I haven't seen any of them before either) will be 
given. But the amateur ethos has gently evolved. Elaine Padmore was the 
artistic director from 1982 to 1994, the longest tenure since Doctor Tom's 
own, and made the name that has now taken her to run the Royal Opera in 
Copenhagen. She knocked some of the rough edges off the way the festival 
was run, and enlarged and redecorated the Theatre Royal as well. Her 
successor, Luigi Ferrari, has brought in some excellent Italian singers 
and introduced a predominantly professional chorus instead of local lads 
and lasses. Needless to say, we old hands have been quietly grumbling that 
Wexford is becoming a little too slick. But somehow I don't think it will 
ever lose its charm.<P>

Opera is only one of the reasons for visiting Wexford. Doctor Tom chose 
October and November to test opera lovers' mettle: Irish weather then is 
at best what's called soft. Apart from the black-tie evening dress that 
everyone admirably wears at the opera, you need warm waterproof clothes. 
But the countryside and coastscape are no less beautiful for that. There 
are plenty of sights to be seen nearby--Johnstown Castle, Rathmacknee 
Castle, and bird sanctuaries among them. I like walking on the 
seabird-packed shore just to the north of Wexford, which is pleasingly 
called the Slobs.<P>

Irish-Americans will want to pay their respects to Commodore John Barry, 
the father of the U.S.  Navy, who gave the Brits a gratifying licking 
during the War of Independence.  His statue stands on the quay; his 
birthplace is Ballysampson, ten miles from Wexford.  Twenty miles to the 
west, on the far side of County Wexford, is Dunganstown, the ancestral 
homestead of <A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/locke/kennedy/index.html">the 
Kennedy family</A>, with the John F.  Kennedy Park and Arboretum nearby.  
From there you can go on to New Ross, whence a barge cruises up the river 
Nore and back, serving a lavish lunch on the way.  Or you can go south to 
the haunting ruin of Dunbrody Abbey, and then to the little village of 
Ballyhack, on Waterford Harbour, to eat at the excellent Neptune fish 
restaurant.  In Wexford town the best place to eat--apart from the two big 
hotels, the Talbot and White's--is the Ocean Bed near Westgate.<P>

And there are the bars.  Yes, the bars of Wexford 
require a treatise of their own, which I am well equipped to write.  At 
least one gentle pub crawl is de rigueur: down Main Street, stopping maybe 
at Kehoe's and the Goal Bar, and then back along the seafront, choosing 
from another three or four bars.  Since the <A 
HREF="http://webpages.marshall.edu/~bennett7/guinness/index.html">Guinness</A> 
company has been the most generous sponsor of the festival over the years, 
the least you can do is to repay it a little.  In any case, you will be 
finding a warmth of welcome that makes every other music festival I know 
look distinctly chilly.<P> October will see my twenty-eighth Wexford 
running, and I look forward to many more.  I hope to be there in 2001 for 
the festival's fiftieth anniversary and, God willing, in 2011 for Doctor 
Tom's hundredth.  "International opera" has become depressingly homogenized 
and glitzy.  It took an Irish provincial doctor to show that opera can be 
curious, vibrant, and fun.<P>

<BR>

<I>This year's <A HREF="http://www.iol.ie/~pobeirne/wexfesop.html">Wexford 
Festival</A> runs from October 17 to November 3.  Tickets go on sale June 4 
at the Theatre Royal, Wexford, Ireland; call 011-353-53-22144 or fax 
011-353-53-24289.  Prices had not been fixed at writing but will be 
slightly more than last year's $55 for weekdays, $73 weekends.  The Irish 
Tourist Board, at 345 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10154 (212-418-0800), can 
provide suggestions about where to stay in Wexford and other 
information.</I><p>

</center>

<p>

<br>

<font size=5>I</font>N THE CONVOLUTED history of Central Africa, the southern Zairean province of

Shaba has long been a magnet for mercenaries and swindlers, a center of

bloodstained intrigue. Belgian colonizers first exploited Shaba's rich deposits

of copper at the turn of the century, in what came to be called the Belgian

Congo -- the richest European colony in Africa, Conrad's "Heart of Darkness." In

1960, when the colony achieved independence, the short-lived secession of the

province, then known as Katanga, helped make the Congo a byword for post

colonial chaos and savagery -- and also black Africa's first Cold War

battleground. It was here, in the provincial capital Elisabethville (now

Lubumbashi), that the charismatic nationalist Patrice Lumumba was famously

martyred in 1961, with the connivance of the Central Intelligence Agency and a

thirty-year-old Congolese colonel who would soon become President of the

country, Joseph Des&eacute;r&eacute; Mobutu.<p>



	Two rebel invasions of Katanga, in 1977 and 1978, brought Belgian, French, and

Moroccan troops to President Mobutu's rescue, many of them ferried by U. S.

planes. These episodes cemented Mobutu's position as an utterly dependent but

indispensable asset to the West. In the 1980s Shaba emerged as a key strategic

outpost for the Reagan Doctrine. Reportedly, the CIA used an airstrip in the

remote Shaban town of Kamina in order to channel covert weapons into

neighboring Angola. President Reagan hailed Mobutu as "a voice of good sense

and good will."<p>



	So it is no surprise that Shaba has emerged as a flash point in one of the

great unfolding dramas of the post-Cold War era: Mobutu's struggle to remain in

power. He is one of the last five-star despots of the Cold War era: Mobutu Sese

Seko Kuku wa za Banga, as he is now called -- which translates as "the

all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win,

will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake." Buffeted by

history's changing winds, bereft of his Western backing, embattled by riotous

troops and pro-democracy forces, and squeezed for cash to keep afloat his

notoriously greedy regime, Mobutu was being tested as never before when I

visited Shaba recently, in search of clues to his survival. Despite mounting

anarchy and economic chaos, Mobutu was confounding widespread predictions of

his imminent demise. I wanted to know how he did it.<p>



	"Ethnic cleansing" was the term that Zaireans, diplomats, and aid workers used

to explain the cramming of tens of thousands of hungry and destitute citizens

into and around two fly-strewn railway stations in the mining towns of Likasi

and Kolwezi. They were refugees in their own country, evidence that the

time-honored practice of "divide and rule" had been effectively executed.

Thumbs were rubbed against forefingers to explain the officially sanctioned

looting of the vital state-owned mining installation in Kolwezi, where

soldiers, politicians, and all manner of foreign hustlers were operating a

none-too-subtle traffic in stolen copper and cobalt and whatever else might

earn a few hundred trillion hyperdeflated cash zaires.  Three years after

Mobutu first promised to share power, amid a wave of popular euphoria over the

news of tumbling regimes in Eastern Europe ("Ceausescu! Mobutu! (Ceausescu!

Mobutu!" they chanted in the streets of Kinshasa), he seems bent on

dismembering the country before the country dismembers him. Talk of the big

man's faltering grip, rife in Kinshasa and abroad, had long since ceased in

Shaba. "It's important to know that Mobutu is a great strategist," I was told.

"He has his ways and means."<p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE TRAIN STATION in downtown Likasi, a two-hour drive northwest of Lubumbashi,

is a crumbling edifice built by the Belgians early in this century. It was part

of the sprawling network of rails and roads that linked the Central African

copper belt to ports in South Africa and the former Portuguese colonies of

Mozambique and Angola. In more prosperous days a substantial portion of the

world's copper and cobalt was produced in this part of the world.<p>



	Today the station is surrounded by a dense warren of shanties, a maze of

burlap and plastic slung over rickety frames fashioned from scrap wood and

rusty bedsprings. Across the tracks and beyond a foot-wide open sewer, row upon

row of green plastic tents, constructed by Belgian workers from the relief

agency M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, extend to the distant horizon.

Each tent is crammed with as many as fourteen men, women, and children. The air

is filled with the smells of rot and excrement, and with the cacophonous din of

scrap metal being pounded into makeshift pots and pans. Five hours west an

equally grim scene is unfolding in Kolwezi. The sidewalks there are piled high

with desks, bureaus, sofas, cabinets, and other household goods, all for sale

to whoever will buy them. Before relief groups moved in to provide vaccinations

and running water, sixty people a day were dying from measles, dysentery,

malaria, and respiratory infections.<p>



	In both towns the refugees are Kasaians, primarily Lubas, born and raised in

Shaba but descended from ancestors who were recruited to the mines from the

neighboring province of Kasai. Over the past year, in the worst wave of ethnic

violence in the region since the Katangan secession of 1960, more than 100,000

Kasaians have been chased from their jobs and homes by rampaging mobs of

indigenous Shabans -- or "Katangese," as they call themselves. Most Kasaians have

congregated at the train stations of Kolwezi and Likasi in the probably futile

hope that one of the infrequent trains will have enough space in its sweltering

boxcars to take them and their families away to Kasai at a price they can

afford. "We cannot stay, because they will cut our throats," I was told.<p>



	The plight of the Kasai in Shaba is less the result of age-old hatreds than of

the machinations of government leaders bent on preserving their power. To be

sure, there is a history of enmity between the Katangese and their generally

better-educated, more successful Kasaian brothers. The Lubas of Kasai have

sometimes considered themselves the "Jews of Africa." They predominate among

the country's intellectuals, professionals, and entrepreneurs. The Belgians

cultivated them as laborers and administrators of the colonial order. Their

families were housed by the mining companies; their children were educated in

company-built schools and made ready to percolate up through even the most

oppressive regimes both before and since independence. Resentment on the part

of the Katangese has grown accordingly.<p>



	"The Kasai are seen as instruments of oppression -- on this all Katangese

agree," Muyembe wa Banze, a Katangan executive at Gecamines, the state-owned

mining giant, told me. "They seemed to be more attached to the white

man -- that's what we have seen. They have come from far away and have all the

advantages. You'll see that the important positions in society are filled by

Kasaians. Mobutu has used the Kasai to oppress the Katangese."<p>



	Yet in Zaire it has been only at times of great political upheaval and

insecurity, such as now, that resentment has turned to terror. What is striking

about the current campaign against the Kasai is how President Mobutu, fighting

for his political survival, has managed to exploit well-founded bitterness

toward his own rapacious regime by deflecting it onto others.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>O</font>N APRIL 24,1990, Mobutu declared an end to single-party rule and the beginning

of a transition to democracy. The Berlin Wall had recently fallen, and the Cold

War was winding down. Mobutu's Western backers -- the United States, France, and

Belgium --  had let him know that the years of reliable support were over. This,

together with mounting strikes and protests in Kinshasa and elsewhere,

compelled Mobutu to open a "sovereign national conference" to prepare for

democratic rule. Opposition leaders returned from exile. Opposition parties

proliferated. A raucous public debate enlivened newspapers long subdued by

fear.<p>



	But problems quickly materialized --  not least in Shaba. Barely two weeks after

Mobutu's declaration unidentified commandos went on a nighttime rampage on the

campus of the University of Lubumbashi, killing a still-unconfirmed number of

students. There followed a spate of armed attacks on the homes of prominent

opposition figures. Opposition rallies were broken up. Arrests and killings

multiplied. Transition governments came and went. More than 200 mutually

antagonistic political parties entered the fray, many backed with enough cash

from Mobutu himself to compound hyperinflation.<p>



	Then came the "<i>pillage</i>." In September of 1991 an astonishing week-long

spree of looting and destruction by underpaid troops of the national army laid

waste to major cities across the country. More than 200 people were killed.

Much of the modern productive sector of the economy was destroyed. The

sidewalks next to major military bases became thriving markets for looted

goods. Most press accounts described these horrendous riots as the work of

"mutinous" troops. But whether the <i>pillage</i> was aimed at toppling Mobutu

remains a mystery; no soldier was ever prosecuted or disciplined.<p>



	Meanwhile, the major opposition parties had managed to form a coalition called

the Union Sacr&eacute;e de l'Opposition. Its candidate to lead the transition

to democracy was a well-known activist named &Eacute;tienne Tshisekedi.

Tshisekedi is from Kasai. After the <i>pillage</i> Mobutu met with the Union

Sacr&eacute;e and, remarkably, agreed to allow the formation of an opposition

government led by Tshisekedi, who was sworn in as Prime Minister on October 16,

1991. He lasted six days. The problem, like almost all problems in Zaire,

boiled down to money. Tshisekedi, with the backing of Western governments,

sought control over Zaire's Central Bank. This Mobutu could not abide. Control

of the printing and distribution of money is a vital tool of Mobutu's; it is

not only the means by which he enriches himself but also his means for

supporting his friends and co-opting his enemies. When Tshisekedi arrived at

his office on October 19, 1991, he found the doors were locked. A replacement

moved in three days later. Nevertheless, the Union Sacr&eacute;e continued to

have broad popular support. Something needed to be done to break up the

opposition alliance. So Mobutu turned to two men from Shaba: Jean Nguza

Karl-i-Bond and Gabriel Kyungu wa Kumwanza.<p>



	Whenever Zaireans describe Mobutu's legendary "musical chairs" system of

government -- the perennial shuffling of his friends and enemies in and out of

favor, in and out of money -- the first case in point is Nguza Karl-i-Bond. Nguza

was Mobutu's Foreign Minister in the early 1970s. He then became the political

director of Zaire's sole political party, the Mouvement Populaire de la

R&eacute;volution (MPR). In 1977 he was accused of treason and sentenced to

death. He is said to have been tortured. But a year later he was freed, and a

year after that he became Prime Minister. Two years after that he fled to exile

in Belgium, where he wrote a book exposing Mobutu's corruption. He later

testified before a congressional subcommittee in Washington about Mobutu's

ill-gotten riches. Then, incredibly, he returned to Mobutu's fold, and in 1986

was sent back to Washington as Zaire's ambassador. Two years later he was the

Foreign Minister again.<p>



	By 1991 Nguza was out of the loop once more and heading the Union des

F&eacute;d&eacute;ralistcs et des Republicains Ind&eacute;pendants (UFERI), one

of the three main opposition parties in the Union Sacr&eacute;e. Gabriel

Kyungu, one of his principal allies, appeared more credible than Nguza as an

oppositionist. Along with Tshisekedi, Kyungu had produced a scathing public

critique of Mobutu's regime in 1980. The two were imprisoned and tortured.

Kyungu was one of the first public figures to decry the massacre of students at

the university, and he drew crowds with populist speeches in which he derided

Mobutu as an <i>hibou</i>, an owl, traditionally associated with black magic.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>B</font>UT THAT WAS before November 25, 1991, when UFERI broke ranks with the Union

Sacr&eacute;e. Mobutu appointed Nguza Prime Minister and Kyungu the governor of

Shaba. The violence against the Kasai in Shaba began soon thereafter.<p>



	Immediately after Governor Kyungu assumed office, he launched a campaign known

as Debout Katanga! --  "Rise up, Katanga!" Its motto was "Katanga for the

Katangese." In a series of public rallies and radio speeches the governor

railed against the "enemy within," the Kasai. Bemoaning the misery of the

Katangan population, Kyungu repeatedly blamed the Kasaians. He called them

<i>bilulu</i> (Swahili for "insects"). "The Kasai are foreigners," he declared.

"The Katangese no longer accept the Kasai here. Their presence is an insult.

They are arrogant and don't hide it. It is not possible for the tribes to live

side by side." In crude harangues that would have been familiar to Asians

driven from Uganda by Idi Amin, Kyungu derided the Kasai as money-grubbing

exploiters who were lucky to be allowed to flee with their lives. "The Kasai

must go and then the Katangese can have the nice jobs and nice houses," he

said.<p>



	Then, employing a tactic long used by Mobutu, Kyungu established the JUFERI, a

youth brigade in his party, as a vigilante force. Mostly unemployed, illiterate

thugs from rural villages, the JUFERI provided a violent accompaniment to

Kyungu's menacing radio broadcasts. Attacks on Kasaian homes in rural towns and

villages began in late 1991. By April of last year the JUFERI, sometimes backed

by mobs of other Katangese, were systematically expelling Kasaians from their

homes. Witnesses said the JUFERI were sometimes supplied with gasoline to set

houses afire and with beer and marijuana to stoke their aggression. Some

Kasaians fought back. The proverbial cycle of violence was set in motion.<p>



	Meanwhile, on February 16, 1992, hundreds of thousands of people marched

through the streets of Kinshasa, a thousand miles away, in support of the

national conference on democracy, which Nguza had ordered closed. Mobutu's

troops opened fire on the marchers; according to the human rights monitoring

group Africa Watch, more than thirty were killed. Mobutu deftly blamed Nguza

and soon afterward allowed the national conference to resume. In August the

conference nominated Tshisekedi to be Prime Minister again. Kasaians in Shaba

celebrated. Reportedly, some marched through the streets of Lubumbashi with

leashed dogs that wore ties and signs saying NGUZA. Some threw stones at the

governor's residence. The JUFERI, armed with knives and machetes, responded

predictably.<p>



	Most Kasaians fled to the train station or to the homes of relatives in town.

Those I spoke with had no doubt about who was ultimately responsible for their

predicament. "It's Mobutu," one of their leaders asserted (few Kasaians were

willing to be identified by name). "As President of the Republic, he can't

lower himself into the streets to wage war against the Kasai. He needs someone

who is malleable. He uses others, like Kyungu -- a pawn of Mobutu."<p>



	Kasaians were quick to remind me that not all Katangese approve of what is

happening: "It's a false problem," I was told repeatedly; "it's a manipulation

by the politicians." Nevertheless, Nguza and Kyungu have plainly tapped a real

vein of resentment. "Monsieur Kyungu expresses the profound aspirations, the

soul of the people," Tshibang Kadjat, a Katangan executive at the mining

company Gecamines, told me. "From colonization to Mobutu, all the advantages go

to the Kasai."<p>



	In fact the majority of Kasaians in Shaba have suffered as much as most

Katangese under a regime that has plundered the province's resources for the

benefit of a few. But Katangan leaders have made a pact with the devil,

calculating that, as one put it, "we have to ally ourselves with the finishing

dictatorship in order to resist the permanent dictatorship of the Kasai."<p>



	"You know," a Kasaian prosecutor in Kolwezi told me over dinner, "Mobutu is

the kind of politician who can profit from any situation to maintain his power.

Before, he attacked the Katangese using the Kasai, who were among his closest

collaborators. Now he realizes that there were radical political oppositionists

among the Kasai. He uses old enmities to destabilize his new enemies. Now he

uses Katangese to destabilize the Kasai."<p>



	A judge interrupted to clarify: "It was not exactly his goal to dominate the

Katangese. Mobutu put Kasaians at the head of many enterprises. But this was so

that he could enjoy the riches of the province with the help of the Kasai. Now

he says it wasn't he who was the cause of the Katangese's unhappiness --  it was

the Kasai. If you look at the situation more closely, both Kasaians and

Katangese are in indescribable misery. Those who benefited are Mobutu and his

acolytes. It's just that most of his acolytes were Kasaians, especially here in

Katanga. This is a region that he has pillaged a lot."<p>



	Soldiers and the police, who might be expected to intervene if Mobutu ordered

them to do so, appear in accounts of the violence only intermittently, most

often as criminals engaged in thefts and assaults that provoke reprisals, which

merely reinforce the cycle of violence. Lawlessness in general, and lawless

soldiers in particular, have been a chronic problem in Zaire ever since

independence, when the entire army dissolved in mutiny within a week. Armed

shakedowns are commonplace. On a single night in Kolwezi, while driving to and

from a restaurant in town, my companions and I were held up at gunpoint five

times by soldiers who emerged like apparitions in our headlights, pointed their

rifles menacingly at the windshield, and then gruffly accepted yet another

proffer of five or ten million zaires -- just under a dollar at that week's

rate.<p>



	The UFERI mayor of Kolwozi, P. Anschaire Moji A Kapasu, told me that the

authorities had done "everything possible" to stop the violence. I asked if

anyone had been arrested and prosecuted. He looked at me with a blank

expression, as if the idea had never occurred to him. "It's difficult in the

mass of people to know who struck who," he said. "You would have to arrest the

whole population. <i>C'est difficile</i>."<p>



<p>



<font size=5>O</font>N THE EDGE of downtown Kolwozi, past the teeming train station, lies the

Gecamines mining installation, a vast, rocky landscape of open pits and coppery

waste dumps. In better days this facility produced up to 80 percent of Zaire's

copper and cobalt. Belgians built the mines early in the century, and Belgian

spies, financiers, and mercenaries known as <i>les Affreux</i> --  "the Dreadful

Ones" -- backed Moise Tshombe's ill-fated secession movement in 1960, hoping to

maintain de facto Belgian control over the lucrative mining industry. Mobutu

nationalized the mines in 1967. At its high point, in the mid-1980s, Gecamines

produced 480,000 tons of copper a year with 35,000 employees, earned three

quarters of Zaire's foreign exchange, and educated 100,000 children in company

run schools.<p>



	Today Gecamines is eerily subdued. A half dozen tense young JUFERI members in

jeans and sport shirts guard the entrance against Kasaians. In the two weeks

before my visit roughly 7,000 Kasaian workers -- half the work force and most of

the skilled employees -- had been chased from their jobs at these mines. In all,

40,000 to 50,000 Kasaians in Kolwezi have been rendered homeless. The mines

still function, I was told, but expatriate company officials doubt that this

will last. The production of copper had already declined to 150,000 tons or

less in the previous year, because of rampant corruption and mismanagement. A

mine collapsed a few years ago owing to negligence. Most of the skilled

expatriates fled after the 1991 pillage. The company is bankrupt.<p>



	A week before my visit ten trucks lined up along the wall surrounding the

plant. Three hundred thieves pushed a hundred tons of copper up to the wall and

loaded it into the trucks, and off they drove to the Zambian border and down to

South Africa. There is an ongoing traffic in stolen copper, cobalt, electrical

wires and pylons, tires, water pumps, and gasoline. Gecamines is being looted

down to the ground. Soldiers, the police, workers, company guards, expatriate

Greeks, Lebanese, and South Africans -- all are collaborating to ransack Zaire's

biggest economic asset.<p>



	According to company officials, legal authorities, diplomats, and townspeople

alike, at the center of the racket is Governor Kyungu. He is said to be getting

a $10,000 kickback for each export license granted to truck goods across the

border. It is an old story in Zaire. "Who's using who?" a clergyman asked. "Is

Mobutu using Kyungu, or is Kyungu using Mobutu? We ask ourselves this question.

If you compare Kyungu when he was in opposition, he was a poor man. Now he is

very rich."<p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE CORRUPTION in Zaire is legendary. The "kleptocracy" has its roots in the

nineteenth century Congo Free State: Belgium's King Leopold II used profits

from the export of the country's extensive natural resources to build a

personal fortune --  profits extracted under conditions of forced labor that

included killing workers and chopping off hands if quotas were not met.

Mobutu's ill-gotten wealth is usually estimated at around $5 billion. Stories

about his bank accounts in Switzerland and his villas, ranches palaces, and

yachts throughout Europe are legion, as are wide-eyed descriptions of his home

at Gbadolite, in northern Zaire, his birthplace; "Versailles in the jungle," it

is called.<p>



	Born in poverty, the son of a domestic cook and a hotel maid, Mobutu is

reported to have obtained his first few million dollars in the early 1960s

from



the CIA and the U.S.-dominated UN peacekeeping force that put down the Katangan

secession. He was the army chief of staff at the time. Mobutu has steadily

augmented his wealth ever since by blurring the distinction between public and

private funds, dipping often into the national treasury. Not least among his

many lucrative sources of "leakage," as the World Bank and the International

Monetary Fund call illegal diversions of money, has been Gecamines. By 1980 it

was estimated that officials were skimming off at least $240 million a year

from the nationalized resource. More recently a World Bank investigation

estimated that up to $400 million -- a fourth of Zaire's export revenues, most of

it earned from Gecamines inexplicably vanished from the country's

foreign-exchange accounts in 1988.<p>



	Sometimes overlooked in accounts of Mobutu's wealth is the critical role that

money plays as a political tool. Even as Mobutu has accumulated great riches,

he has had to spend huge sums to reward his allies and buy off his opponents.

The word on the street in Kinshasa, impossible to confirm but relayed to me by

a diplomatic source who found it credible, is that Mobutu paid Nguza $10

million to break with the Union Sacr&eacute;e and become Prime Minister. "It's

like the Mafia," a Zairean lawyer said. "All Zairean politicians are poor. For

survival they have to engage in politics. To earn a living, they have to be on

the side of the man in power."<p>



	Herman Cohen, who was the assistant secretary of state for African affairs in

the Bush Administration, and who first met Mobutu almost thirty years ago,

agreed when we spoke that Zaire's central government is "basically a clan a

family of cousins acting like the Mafia in Sicily, making these illegal deals,

siphoning the money off cobalt and copper revenues." Cohen added, "Mobutu

requires a huge cash flow. He has to keep the family afloat. In effect he has

about three thousand to four thousand dependents, including women and children.

It's essentially his own tribe. The attitude is, 'We've got to all hang

together. If we don't, we're dead."'<p>



	Among the most important of these dependents are, of course, soldiers. A

certain amount of cash has to be on hand for them. When money is tight, as it

often is now that the economy is in ruins, Mobutu's tendency has been simply to

print more. Hyperinflation generally follows. This was the result last January,

when Mobutu tried to meet his military payroll by introducing new

five-million-zaire notes into circulation, worth about $2 each at the time. The

opposition, led by Tshisekedi, feared yet another round of hyperinflation, and

urged shopkeepers to refuse to accept them. The strategy worked. The soldiers

found they were unable to spend their money. So they went on another

<i>pillage</i>, looting Kinshasa even more viciously and destructively than

they had in 1991. This time Mobutu's elite troops intervened, grabbing their

share and then summarily executing hundreds of rank-and-file looters.

Nevertheless, the newly printed notes were effectively barred from use

 -- everywhere, that is, except in Mobutu's home province of Equateur and in

Shaba, where Governor Kyungu successfully coerced businesses into accepting

them. Prices took off. The black-market value of zaires, 2.5 million to the

dollar in Kinshasa in April, went from 12 million to 24 million to the dollar

in Lubumbashi during the first two weeks of that month.<p>



	There remains the question of why Mobutu tolerates the gutting of Gecamines, a

pillar of the economy and an indispensable source of foreign exchange. The

answer is diamonds. By all accounts, Mobutu has managed to work out an

alternative racket involving the export of diamonds from Kasai. Zaire is one of

the world's largest producers of diamonds. Last year recorded diamond exports

came to $230 million. Unrecorded exports? "Anybody's guess," a diplomat told

me, "but certainly larger, by a substantial margin." Reportedly, an array of

mostly Lebanese diamond buyers, working with silent partners in the Central

Bank and in the military, are reaping hefty profits in a complex

foreign-exchange scam involving a parallel market in checks worth as much as

forty times the official exchange rate. They bring in their foreign currency,

exchange it for zaires with their silent partners, and then head for the

diamond mines. The proceeds leaving the back door of the Central Bank are

keeping afloat Mobutu's extended "family" of relatives, elite troops, ethnic

kinsmen, and followers. So Gecamines may be expendable.<p>



<p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE LOSERS IN all this, needless to say, are the long-suffering Zairean people.

Last year inflation soared to more than 6,000 percent. Unemployment is at 80

percent. Gross domestic product has by some estimates been contracting by as

much as 30 percent a year since the<i> pillage</i>. Hospitals and schools have

repeatedly shut down. Teachers in Likasi had been on strike for more than a

month when I was there; their average monthly salary of 30 million zaires was

worth four bottles of beer. Many Zaireans eat just one meal a day, some only

one every other day. The public-service sector has largely stopped functioning.

Tax collection has ceased -- except for the "direct taxation" of army shakedowns.

The country's banking system has all but collapsed. The nation of nearly 40

million, four times the geographic size of France, is heading deeper into

anarchy by the day.<p>



	Yet it is precisely these conditions that have made Mobutu's tactics

effective. Most Zaireans see a method in his seeming madness, a deliberate

strategy of destabilization as a means of discrediting the movement toward

democracy and undermining the capacity of the people to mobilize against him.

"Mobutu tries to keep the population in fear," a lawyer in Kolwezi told me.

"The population is traumatized. Mobutu wants to keep them in this position for

a long time. That's how he maintains his position."<p>



	Foreigners living in Zaire often marvel at the "passivity" of the Zairean

people; one I spoke to speculated about a version of the "battered-woman

syndrome." But Zaireans point out that Mobutu and his allies still have all the

guns and all the money. Hundreds of thousands of people marched in Kinshasa,

they reminded me, and more than thirty of them were shot dead. In any event, a

clergyman said, "when the population is hungry and tired, it doesn't have the

energy to go into the streets."<p>



	A U.S. State department paper of earlier this year raised the specter of

Zaire's becoming "Somalia and Liberia rolled into one, with vast potential for

immense refugee flows, regional destabilization, and humanitarian disaster."

Whether Zaire is headed down that path is far from certain. The country is not

armed to the teeth as Somalia was, and it is blessed with a lush tropical

climate that makes widespread famine less likely. Moreover, the country is so

huge and diffuse -- Shaba alone is nearly the size of France -- that it lacks the

implosive potential of Liberia, where the importation of large quantities of

arms touched off a conflagration that consumed the entire country in less than

a year. What does seem clear is that the longer Mobutu's strategy of

progressive disintegration lasts, the more widespread and irreversible will be

the forces of anarchy. Already reports of "ethnic cleansing" much like those

from Shaba are emerging from the northeastern region of Kivu.<p>



	That is why many Zaireans are in favor of foreign intervention. A Katangan

executive at Gecamines put it this way: "The West and the United States have a

moral obligation vis-a-vis Africa. At the time of the Cold War, the West and

the United States produced dictators. They armed them. They organized coups.

Now that the Cold War is finished, the West has a moral obligation to get rid

of the dictators of Africa. When they created these dictators, they didn't ask

for the advice of the African people."<p>



	The American policy-makers I have spoken with are clearly at a loss about what

should be done. "The solution is not obvious," I was told. Armed United Nations

intervention to support an election process -- the solution favored by Tshisekedi

and many other Zaireans --  would be unsalable in the United States even if it

were feasible. The strategy of nudging the transition process from the

sidelines has withered under Mobutu's endlessly subversive machinations. All

along there has been concern that if Mobutu could somehow be extracted from the

scene, his departure would create a vacuum into which the soldiers left behind

would rush, with frightful results. By this line of argument, Mobutu has stoked

the forces of anarchy to such a degree that he has made himself indispensable

as a means of controlling them. <i>Apr&egrave;s moi, le d&eacute;luge</i>, he

has implied for thirty years. At this late date he may be right.<p>

<h1>Violence and Unrest in Central Africa</h1> 



</center>



<br>

<br>	





<font size=4> <font size=5>T</font>wo years ago more than a million Hutu 

refugees fled Rwanda in a panicked mass migration that captured the 

world's attention.  The Hutus, who had carried out a campaign of genocide 

against the rival Tutsi tribe, feared reprisals from the new Tutsi 

government.  This month the world watched as 500,000 of those refugees 

streamed back into Rwanda to escape fighting in Zaire.  So ended yet 

another episode in the increasingly long history of tension and warfare 

between the Hutus and the Tutsis -- and of the West's equivocation about 

whether to intervene.  If history is any guide, there's more trouble to 

come.  Several past <i>Atlantic</i> articles help put the most recent 

crisis in historical perspective and offer broad ways of contemplating 

policies of assistance and intervention.<p>







In an <A HREF="atlrep.htm">"Atlantic Report"</a> on Rwanda published in June, 1964, the <i>Atlantic</i>

editors traced how the Tutsi minority came  to govern the Hutu majority

through a system of feudalism dating back four centuries -- until the Hutus

revolted in 1959, killing 10,000 Tutsis and forcing hundreds of thousands to

flee to neighboring countries. The authors argued that if the outside world did

not provide aid to Rwanda to help the country develop its economy and break out

of a cycle of tribal violence, "Rwanda is likely to remain on the world's

conscience."<p>







In <a href="meisler.htm">"Rwanda and Burundi"</a> (September, 1973), 

Stanley Meisler reported on another chapter of ethnic violence between the two

peoples in which the Tutsi government of Burundi responded to an attempted coup

by killing more than 100,000 Hutus, wiping out those with any wealth,

education, or government experience. In Rwanda the Hutus retaliated by killing

some Tutsis and forcing others out of universities. Then, as in 1994, when up to

a million Tutsis were massacred by Hutus, the outside world seemed 

paralyzed. Meisler wrote:<p>



<font size=3>

<blockquote>

One of the strangest sides to all the bloodshed between Tutsis and Hutus has

been the feeble reaction of the rest of the world. Last year's slaughter in

Burundi must rank with the most terrible in history. Yet Christian missionaries

kept quiet or muted their concern. Most foreign governments, including the

United States, refused to protest in public at the time.<p>

</blockquote>

</font>



While tensions between Hutus and Tutsis created the recent refugee crisis, the

civil unrest caused by Zairean rebels trying to overthrow Mobutu Sese Seko was

the spark. Bill Berkeley's <a href="zaire.htm">"Zaire: An African Horror 

Story"</a> (August, 1993)

explored how, through a regime of corruption, violence, and shrewd

manipulation, Mobutu has managed to keep a grip on power since he first took

over Zaire, with the help of the Central Intelligence Agency, in the 1960s. He

has maintained his leadership despite (or perhaps thanks to) a state of near anarchy in which

inflation has reached more than 6,000 percent and

unemployment has stood  at 80 percent.<p>



<font size=3>

<blockquote>

Buffeted by history's changing winds, bereft of his Western backing, embattled

by riotous troops and pro-democracy forces, and squeezed for cash to keep

afloat his notoriously greedy regime, Mobutu was being tested as never before.

. . . Despite mounting anarchy and economic chaos, Mobutu was confounding

widespread predictions of his imminent demise. I wanted to know how he did it.

</blockquote>

</font>



<p>



In his widely discussed article <a 

href="../../../election/connection/foreign/anarcf.htm">"The Coming 

Anarchy"</a> (January, 1994),  Robert

Kaplan described how Third World scenes such as the recent ones from Rwanda 

and 

Zaire -- tribal warfare, refugee migrations, spreading disease, and

weak central government -- all suggest what will visit the rest

of the world in the twenty-first century.  In <a 

href="../../../issues/96aug/proport/proport.htm">"Proportionalism"</a> (August, 1996)

Kaplan responded to critics, many of whom accused him of doomsaying, by sketching out a

policy for assistance to the Third World based on a philosophy of limiting 

our foreign aid and humanitarian intervention to cases where we are sure it 

will do some good and where our goals can be easily accomplished. We will have to make some

 painful choices, Kaplan argued, as we are faced with diminished

coffers for foreign aid and ever more places where that aid is needed.  <p>

	<font size=5>T</font>he central African Republic of Rwanda lies isolated and landlocked between the Nile and Congo River basins

some 1000 miles from the Indian Ocean and 1600 miles from the Atlantic. It is

roughly the size of Vermont and has the highest population density in Africa

South of the Sahara (245 persons per square mile) and the lowest per capita

income ($50 per year).<p>



	Rwanda has always known population pressure on scant resources; yet, in the

midst of this scarcity one sector of its population evolved a highly intricate

society, which has today fallen apart. The consequences of the destruction of

that society and the attempt to replace it with another lie at the root of

Rwanda's present tragic situation.<p>



	The population of Rwanda is divided into three distinct tribal groups sharing

a common language. The pygmoid Twa constitute less than one percent of the

population and are rarely seen, being hunters and forest dwellers. The short,

stocky, Bantu, Negroid Hutu represent 85 percent of the population. They were

the first to fell Rwanda's forest, to clear the brush, and to cultivate. They

never evolved a centralized political system, and their reliance on small units

formed around clan chiefs made them highly vulnerable to invasion.<p>



	Some four centuries ago a tall, slender, haughty, exquisitely aristocratic

people known as the Tutsi conquered Rwanda through a combination of force and

persuasion. Although they never constituted more than 15 percent of the

population, their hierarchical organization, built around a king known as the

Mwami, their development of specialized warrior castes, and above all their

possession of cattle enabled them to dominate the Hutu. Reputed to have

originated in Ethiopia or the Nile Valley, the Tutsis were the outer fringe of

a great southbound pastoral migration.<p>



<p>



<b>The Tutsi sacred cows</b><p>



<b></b><p>



	The Tutsi promised protection and cattle to individual Hutu, who in turn

accepted the Tutsi as their lords to whom they owed personal services and a

portion of their crops, and who eventually secured possession of all cattle and

land. Each Tutsi was the client of another Tutsi patron, the Mwami being at the

pinnacle.<p>



	This feudal system was justified by an elaborate ideology which had as its

essential premise the fundamental inequality of human beings. According to

legend, the first king of Rwanda had three sons, Gatwa, Gahutu, and Gatutsi. In

order to choose his successor he entrusted each one with a pot of milk to guard

overnight. The gluttonous Gatwa immediately guzzled down the milk; Gahutu dozed

off and let the pot spill, returning it half empty the next day; but the

faithful Gatutsi stayed awake to guard it throughout the night. Therefore the

King chose Gatutsi as his successor, to be forever free from manual labor, with

Gahutu who lacked self-control as his eternal serf, while the avaricious Gatwa

was banished.<p>



	This legend reflects the reality of four centuries of Tutsi domination whereby

a small and highly self-conscious minority indulged in the pleasures of a

distinct leisure class through the exploitation of the Hutu majority. The basis

of this exploitation was the cow. The highly exotic, sleek long-horned

<i>Ndanga</i> cattle were the only recognized form of wealth, and Hutus could

obtain them only by serving their Tutsi masters, who could at any time break

the relationship and regain all the cattle they had lent to their clients.<p>



	It was not until 1894 that the first European entered Rwanda. Four years later

Rwanda and the neighboring Tutsi kingdom of Burundi came under German rule.

Both countries had first been allotted to Germany at the Berlin Conference in

1885, during the colonial scramble for Africa.<p>



	At the end of the First World War Belgium acquired a League of Nations mandate

for Rwanda as partial compensation for war reparations which Germany would be

unlikely to be able to pay. The Belgians continued the German system of

indirect rule, relying upon the Mwami and the Tutsi officialdom and confining

administrative posts and education to the Tutsi elite.<p>







	While never directly attacking the basis of Tutsi rule, the colonial period

set in motion forces which led to its eventual destruction. Foremost among

these forces was Christianity, which preached the equality of all men in the

eyes of Christ. The Catholics took an early lead and soon converted the Mwami

and his court; through the Church the Hutus could aspire to status, education,

and authority, which were denied them elsewhere. The introduction of cash

cropping and cultivation of Arabica coffee provided Hutu peasants with an

income and lessened their reliance on their Tutsi masters. Finally, because of

population pressures, thousands of Hutus migrated to neighboring territories,

where some were exposed to and returned with ideas of democracy and majority

rule.<p>



	The sudden attainment of political independence by the former Belgian Congo,

and United Nations pressure on the Belgians, who exercised a trusteeship for

Rwanda, caused political activity in Rwanda to spurt. It was obvious that

unless the Hutus seized power before the Belgians left, an independent Rwanda

in Tutsi hands would forever enslave the Hutu. Yet the Hutus were handicapped

by their lack of education and experience and their inborn submissiveness.<p>



<p>



<b>The rise of the Hutus</b><p>



<p>



	On July 24, 1959, the forty-six-year-old Mwami Rudahigwa died suddenly under

mysterious circumstances without having designated his successor. This proved

the occasion for the decisive clash between the Tutsi and the embryonic

Parmehutu, the political organization of the Hutu, led by Gregoire Kayibanda,

former seminary student, guide at the Brussels World's Fair, and editor of the

Catholic newspaper. While the Tutsis quickly installed the Mwami's nephew as

the new king and prepared a terrorist campaign against leading Hutu

politicians, the Hutu masses staged an uprising under Parmehutu direction. The

Mwami was deposed and fled the country along with thousands of other Tutsi

refugees, and a provisional Hutu government was installed.<p>



	Two extremely bitter years followed, during which a United Nations-supervised

referendum resulted in an 80 percent victory for the Parmehutu Party and the

decisive rejection of the monarchy. Periodic fighting between Hutus and Tutsis

continued, and additional thousands of refugees fled the country.<p>



	Meanwhile, in neighboring Burundi, to which Rwanda was linked by a customs and

monetary union, the sixty-four-year-old Mwami Mwambutsa used the political

skills garnered through fifty years on the throne to hold his country and Tutsi

rule together. While Rwanda achieved independence on July 1, 1962, as a

republic, Burundi remained a monarchy, and ideological strains caused relations

between the two countries to deteriorate rapidly.<p>



	Among the 100,000 Tutsis who fled Rwanda prior to its independence and the

250,000 who remained behind, there are many who refuse to face a life of

permanent exile or to accept Hutu rule. Four centuries of domination have led

them to believe that they are superior to the humble, submissive, and

physically inferior Hutu. Among the hard-core exiles a secret terrorist

organization known as the Inyenzi was formed. This became the focus of

counterrevolutionary activity directed at overthrowing the Rwanda government

and restoring the monarchy.<p>



	Rwanda enjoyed relative peace for eighteen months following independence while

the Inyenzi confined their activities to agitation among the Tutsi refugees.

The dedicated government of thirty-seven-year-old President Kayibanda

instituted an austerity program unique in Africa. The government was less

successful in persuading the population to continue the highly unpopular

antierosion works and the supervised growing of quality coffee which the

Belgians had maintained through compulsion. The government's greatest

achievement was in abrogating the feudal contracts over cattle and land, which

had been the nexus of Tutsi domination.<p>



<p>



<b>Invasion by refugees</b><p>



<p>



	This period of calm has been rudely and decisively shattered by three invasion

attempts mounted by the Inyenzi. The first of these occurred on Novermber 25,

1963, when 3000 Tutsi refugees in Burundi began a march toward the Rwanda

border to "return to their homeland." The marchers included old men, women, and

children, as well as three truckloads of arms. The marchers were spotted by

missionaries and UN refugee officials, and the Burundi government intervened to

turn them back.<p>



	The second invasion attempt occurred on December 20, 1963, one day after the

conclusion of a conference between the Rwanda and Burundi governments in which

they agreed to dissolve their customs and monetary union. The invaders struck

this time at Nemba on the Rwanda-Burundi border. They were armed only with

homemade rifles, spears, and bows and arrows, and first attacked a Rwanda

military base under construction, where they seized light arms and two jeeps.

The invaders then proceeded north toward Kigali, the smallest and probably

worst-defended capital in the world, with a population of 4500 and one paved

street. They advanced to within twelve miles of Kigali before they were

intercepted by the Rwanda Garde Nationale. The invaders fled, suffering heavy

losses, after a battle waged with modern weapons but highly reminiscent of an

intertribal skirmish.<p>



	The Rwanda government was panic-stricken by the news of the second invasion

attempt. Rwanda's mountainous terrain, lack of village life, and open borders

make it ideal for terrorist operations. The one-thousand-man Garde Nationale

had its hands full defending the capital and the border posts, and the defense

of the country would have had to rely on the civilian Hutu population taking up

arms.<p>



	The government took two measures to guard the country against further invasion

and internal subversion (the second group of invaders had made contact with

local Tutsis). Prominent Tutsis throughout Rwanda were arrested and herded to

government prisons, where after severe beatings the majority were released.

However, all those whose names had been found on a list of people whom the

invaders planned to install as government officials were shot. This list had

been taken off the body of a Congolese mercenary killed while fighting with the

invaders.<p>



	The second measure was to send a minister to each of Rwanda's ten prefectures

to organize the "self-defense" of the civilian population with the aid of the

local prefect and the elected burgomasters. The individual situation in each

prefecture and the attitude of local officials, rather than government policy,

caused the subsequent massive reprisals and massacres of the local Tutsi

population which have been so widely reported.<p>



	The worst slaughter took place in Gikongoro prefecture, where the dense

tropical forest provides an open border with Burundi. Here, word had been

received that Kigali had fallen and the former Mwami restored. Local Tutsis had

for several days prior to the invasion been boasting of their hopes of

returning to power and had been congregating around the former royal residence,

located in this prefecture. Whether spontaneously or upon the orders of local

officials, the Hutu population arose against the Tutsis in this prefecture.<p>



	The most reliable estimates of the numbers killed are between 10,000 and

14,000. The population used any weapons nearby, mostly hoes and long knives for

cutting grass, resulting in hideous atrocities. Bodies were dumped into rivers

and streams, left alongside roads to be scavenged by wild animals, and buried

in mass graves.<p>



	Elsewhere in Rwanda timely action averted tragedy. Thus, in Kibungo prefecture

on the Tanganyikan border the Catholic White Fathers prevailed upon the local

authorities not to excite the Hutu population. The result was relative calm;

Hutu and Tutsi celebrated Christmas mass together, and local Tutsis turned over

to the authorities an Inyenzi invader hiding among them. Yet the White Fathers

were convinced that had a single Tutsi hut been burned, all the Tutsis in the

prefecture would have fled. <p>



	There was never a government policy of genocide against the Tutsi.<p>



	Beginning on Christmas Eve, 6000 Tutsis, including 5300 women and children,

fled into Uganda, with 13,000 head of cattle. No attempt was made by the Rwanda

government to interfere with this defenseless horde or even larger masses of

refugees who fled into Burundi, the Congo, and Tanganyika. Other thousands of

Tutsis took refuge in Catholic mission stations within Rwanda, where they

believed they would be safe because of Catholic influence in the government.

While the government tried to induce these internal refugees to return to their

homes, it took no action against them.<p>



	A third invasion attempt occurred at Kizinga on the Uganda border on December

27. At this point 500 well-armed Tutsis, coming mostly from the Congo, were met

by a force of the Rwanda Garde Nationale, which had been alerted for several

days to expect an attack. The invaders were repulsed; more than 300 were

killed, and the others were taken prisoner by Uganda officials.<p>



<p>



<b>A call for UN help</b><p>



<p>



	This invasion attempt prompted the Rwanda government to cable U Thant for UN

assistance. Max Dorsinville, personal representative of U Thant in the Congo,

arrived in Kigali on January 1 and spent several days in the country before

going on to Burundi. His failure to protest vociferously or threaten

international action enabled the reprisals to continue, and they were not

brought under control until mid-January, largely as a result of pressure from

Catholic and Protestant authorities and foreign embassies within Rwanda.

Meanwhile, the world remained almost totally uninformed since Radio Rwanda is

too weak to be heard outside the Country and Rwanda has no newspapers except a

monthly bulletin in Kinyarwanda.<p>



	Today Rwanda remains in a state of constant military alert, with passes

required for traveling within the Country and military roadblocks maintained on

the principal roads. The effects of the invasions and of the security situation

have been disastrous for the Rwanda economy. The cash sector, dependent almost

entirely on exports of coffee, is dying, and the standard of living has fallen

markedly. The subsistence sector continues to supply adequate foodstuffs,

although malnutrition is widespread. Rwanda hopes to create its own currency,

although its foreign-exchange reserves are depleted and its balance-of-payments

deficit is chronic. Only Belgian and other external aid and technicians are

keeping the nonsubsistence sector of the economy alive.<p>



	The 150,000 Tutsi refugees huddled along Rwanda's borders provide a constant

security threat and a fertile ground for Inyenzi agitation. Their presence

makes life impossible for the Tutsis remaining in Rwanda, who are regarded was

suspect by the Rwanda government.<p>



	Urgent measures are required to prevent Rwanda from erupting again into

violence and to restore hope to its crippled economy. Among these are military

measures to control the refugees and prevent further invasion attempts by the

Inyenzi. The neighboring governments of Uganda, Tanganyika, and the Congo are

using the limited military means at their disposal toward these ends, and the

Burundi government is under pressure to do likewise. Also required is external

assistance to enable the permanent resettlement of the refugees in the

neighboring countries, where fortunately there is ample unused arable land.<p>



	Finally, even if the Tutsi question is resolved, Rwanda still faces a

galloping population increase threatening its meager resources. The strength of

Catholicism within Rwanda and the traditional high regard for children rule out

artificial methods of population control. Meanwhile, at the present rate the

population will double within twenty-three years, and unless a long-term

economic plan is implemented to increase agricultural productivity and bring

additional lands into cultivation, the only alternative will be a return to

pre-colonial Malthusian methods of population control. This can be averted if

economic planning, technical assistance, and external aid to the total sum of

$8 to $10 million a year are forthcoming.  Otherwise, Rwanda is likely to

remain on the world's conscience.<p>

	<font size=5>T</font>he enormity and horror of it all are exposed by what a visitor does not see

in Bujumbura. Bujumbura, a languid, colorless, nondescript town on Lake

Tanganyika, is the capital of Burundi, a central African nub of a country in

which 85 percent of the population is Hutu. Yet a visitor can find few Hutus in

Bujumbura. It is a little like entering Warsaw after World War II and looking

for Jews. A visitor would not need a tour of Treblinka to know that something

terrible had happened.<p>



	In Burundi, something terrible <i>has</i> happened. A year ago, the

government, run by the minority Tutsi tribe, tried to eliminate, in a chilling

and systematic way, the entire elite class of the Hutu people -- all those with

some education, government jobs, or money. The death toll was perhaps one

hundred thousand, perhaps as great as two hundred thousand. Since then there

has been even more killing, the latest in May and June of this year.<p>



	The troubles have also devastated a good deal of the south of the country. On

the road to Nyanza Lac, near the Tanzanian border, many homes are deserted.

Almost half the classrooms and two-thirds of the clinics are destroyed. The

coffee bushes, the main crop of Burundi, are overgrown and untended. A visitor

hardly sees a commercial truck anymore.<p>



	Nyanza Lac itself, once an administrative center with a population of twenty

thousand, now looks like an unused movie set for an old Western. Arab traders

sit in front of a few shops, but most are closed. Several, in fact, are in a

shambles, The main grocery sells only margarine, tomato paste, canned mackerel,

soft drinks, and beer. The school, the Catholic mission, the dispensary, the

customs office are closed. The houses where French foreign-aid technicians once

lived are stripped bare. Burundi officials say that two thousand people now

live in Nyanza Lac, but a visitor cannot find them.<p>



	The slaughter that accompanied this devastation was not an isolated outburst

in the history of this part of the world. It was only more and worse than what

has happened before. There has been mass tribal killing in Burundi and its

neighbor Rwanda for more than a decade, the killing in one provoking the

killing in the other. The scene of the bloodshed, in fact, moved to Rwanda in

the first months of this year. There is no end in sight.<p>



	The latest slaughter in Burundi was ignited by Hutu refugees who crossed the

borders from Rwanda and Tanzania in the middle of May to avenge last year's

massacres and overthrow the Tutsi government. Though the Hutus failed, the

frightened Tutsi government ordered all Tutsis to undergo military training.

Tutsi youths organized patrols to guard Bujumbura, now a Tutsi city, from the

Hutu countryside. And soldiers and young vigilantes began reprisals against

Hutus living outside the city.<p>



	It is not clear how many Hutus have died in the latest slaughter. But

thirty-eight thousand new refugees had fled to Tanzania by the end of June.

Many showed up with panga (machete) wounds, some infested with maggots. Some

died from their wounds there in refugee camps. A Catholic priest, Father Ramon

Vincens, who works near the Tanzania-Burundi border, quoted Hutu refugees as

telling him that the program of genocide against the Hutus was "worse than the

one last year."<p>



<p>



<b>Contemporary feudalism</b><p>



<p>



	Burundi and its neighbor Rwanda represent extreme cases of the failure of

traditional African institutions to adapt to the extraordinary and swift

changes of modern Africa. Each about the size of Maryland, each with almost

four million people, Burundi and Rwanda are the most densely populated

countries in Africa and among the poorest in the world. Their people graze

cattle and farm on the verdant hills along Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika. The

histories and traditions of the peoples of both countries are similar.<p>



	More than four hundred years ago, the Tutsi people (better known by the

African plural, Watutsi) came down to Rwanda and Burundi from the north,

probably Ethiopia. They were cattle farmers, probably Hamitic, with slender

features and skin somewhat lighter than that of most other Africans. The Tutsis

were tall, some well over six feet.<p>



	Rwanda and Burundi were already inhabited then by a few pygmies and by many

Hutu people, farmers who lived by their hoes. They were Bantu people, short,

stocky, dark, with negroid features.<p>



	Over the years, the small group of Tutsi immigrants subjugated the masses of

Hutus into a kind of feudal system. Much as in medieval Europe, a pyramid

developed with Tutsi lords giving their own loyalty to more important Tutsi

lords in exchange for protection. A Mwami, or Tutsi king, ruled at the top of

the pyramid in each country. There were variations to the basic feudal scheme,

but one thing was clear: centuries of tradition made the Tutsis feel like a

privileged, superior people and the Hutus feel like a subjugated, inferior

people.<p>



	Many of the ideas generated during the era of independence in Black Africa

challenged the feudal structure of Rwanda and Burundi. Only 15 percent of the

population in Burundi and 10 percent in Rwanda, the Tutsis began to feel deep

fears about their place in societies where power might go to the majority. The

Hutus' feeling of inferiority and the Tutsis' fears probably account for most

of the terrible bloodshed in the last decade.<p>



<p>



<b>Eliminating opposition</b><p>



<p>



	The first troubles took place in Rwanda. In early 1961, the Hutu leaders, with

the connivance of Belgian colonial officials, overthrew the Mwami of Rwanda.

Rwanda became independent in 1962 as a republic run by Hutus. This revolution

was accompanied by continual persecution of the Tutsi minority which reached

its peak in 1963 and 1964. It is probable that since the Mwami of Rwanda was

overthrown the Hutus have killed more than twenty thousand Tutsis and forced

two hundred thousand to take refuge in neighboring Uganda, Zaire, and Burundi<p>



	Unlike Rwanda, Burundi became independent in 1962 as a kingdom, with a Mwami

still ruling. He lasted only four years, and was overthrown in 1966 not by

Hutus but by Tutsi army officers from a non-royal clan led by Michel Micombero,

now Burundi's President. Since independence, Hutu rebels have tried to take

over Burundi in various coups, plots, and uprisings. Each attempt has been met

by Tutsi reprisals. The worst reprisal came last year after the most serious

Hutu uprising.<p>



	The killings began in late April, 1972, reached their height in May, and

ended, more or less, by August. Many Tutsis killed because they had been

frightened by the Hutu uprising, in which a few thousand Tutsis died. But it

would be misleading to blame the massacre of Hutus on a savage frenzy of Tutsi

fear. There was some wild, indiscriminate killing -- the devastation in the south

is proof of that. But most Hutus were wiped out in a cold and calculated way by

a Tutsi government that seemed to feel that it could guarantee itself power for

at least another decade by eliminating all potential leaders of the majority

tribe. The repression was far out of proportion to the provocation.<p>



	According to most sources, the government had lists of intended victims. "I

know some Hutus," said an American, "who begged Tutsi friends in the government

to check the lists to see if they were on it." The lists were not exclusive.

One source said a Tutsi official tried to reassure the wife of a missing Hutu

by showing her a government list without her husband's name on. it. But he had

been killed anyway.<p>



	In Bujumbura, many victims were killed in prison. "We kept sending food to my

Hutu secretary in prison," said a diplomat, "until one day they told us not to

bother anymore." There are all kinds of grisly stories about the methods of

execution, all difficult to verify. But most sources agree with a diplomat who

said, "They did not use many bullets."<p>



	The bodies were thrown on trucks and driven from the city to a field near the

airport. In the first few days, the trucks rumbled through town in daylight.

But the government later decided to try to hide what it was doing. The trucks

were shifted to night runs. But that did not hide very much. "We were driving

home one evening behind a truck," a Belgian woman recalled, "when my little boy

asked me what was that inside the truck. They were bodies, piled up and

tangled, some hanging over. It was terrible." Under bright lighting, bulldozers

dug mass graves at night and covered them over.<p>



	There seemed to be three kinds of victims. First, the government tried to kill

almost every Hutu who had a government job, including Hutu soldiers. Many of

the death lists were simply lifted from civil service rolls. Second, the

government tried to kill all Hutus who had enough wealth for potential

leadership. Wealth is a very relative term in Africa. Many sources say that the

so-called wealthy Hutus were any who owned a shop, had a bank account, or lived

in a house with a corrugated iron roof instead of a thatched one. Finally, the

government tried to kill all educated Hutus. Almost all Hutu university

students, many Hutu secondary school students, and perhaps half the country's

Hutu teachers were killed. In one incident, six women teachers were killed in

front of their students. The categories of victims explain why a visitor sees

hardly any Hutus inside Bujumbura but will see many trudging along the road,

with hoes on their shoulders, in the countryside.<p>



	Sometimes it is difficult for an outsider to understand how the government was

able to inflict so much punishment on the Hutus. They outnumbered the Tutsis

almost six to one. Yet the Hutus were cowed by an army that numbered no more

than four thousand at the start of the troubles and far less after it purged

itself of Hutus. Seventy-five thousand Hutus fled Burundi and took refuge in

Zaire, Tanzania, and Rwanda. But the great mass of Hutus remained behind and

took their punishment without much resistance.<p>



	Although many Hutus were taken from their homes, there are stories of others

simply accepting summonses and reporting to the police at the scheduled time

even though they knew that death awaited them. There are other stories of

officials loading Hutus on trucks and, when the trucks were full, ordering the

remaining Hutus to come back the next day. The Hutus obeyed. One Hutu Cabinet

member was overseas when the troubles erupted yet flew home to his execution.<p>



	Some observers say that even Hutus trying to escape did so half-heartedly.

"They were pathetic," said one foreigner who has worked with Hutus for many

years. "Any kid with a third-grade education in the United States has read

enough funny books to know how to escape. But they would walk to the border

down the main road. If one gendarme stopped them, they would turn back." After

centuries of psychological dependence on their Tutsi lords, the Hutus did as

they were told, even if the order meant their death.<p>



<p>



<b>"Only the guilty . . ."</b><p>



<p>



	The government does not deny that great killing took place, but it has issued

a self-serving interpretation of the events. According to an official white

paper, a force of twenty-five thousand Hutus, many led by former Congolese

rebels called Mulelists, attacked Burundi in April, 1972, and massacred fifty

thousand Tutsis in an attempted genocide of the Tutsi people. The government

put down the revolt and executed those responsible: "Only the guilty have been

punished," President Micombero said. "The innocent were not troubled at all."

The government's version of the events is rejected by all foreign sources in

Bujumbura as grossly exaggerating the original Hutu attack and hiding the

horror of the repression.<p>



	It was inevitable that the massacres in Burundi would unleash the pent-up

resentment of Hutus for their former Tutsi lords in neighboring Rwanda. The

resentment was exacerbated there by the Hutu failures since independence. Their

economy was stagnant, going nowhere. Because of years of privilege and

education, the Tutsis still had a disproportionate share of jobs in the private

economy and places in secondary schools and the University of Rwanda. With

these frustrations, it was natural for Hutu politicians, who face elections

later this year, to play on the resentment against Tutsis in Rwanda.<p>



	In the first months of this year, Hutus have forced private employers to

dismiss their Tutsi workers and have frightened Tutsi students away from the

university and secondary schools. There has been rioting and murder of Tutsis

on the hills in the countryside, though not on the scale of the earlier

massacres in Rwanda or of the slaughter of Hutus in Burundi last year. Foreign

sources in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, put this year's death toll at

somewhere between 750 and 3000.<p>



	At the University of Rwanda at Butare, a list appeared on the bulletin board

demanding the expulsion of seventeen Tutsi students. Hutu students formed

tribunals to check the bloodline of other students to determine who was really

Tutsi. Bands of Hutus roamed the campus and town looking for Tutsi students,

smashing those they found with iron bars. In the end, 175 Tutsis, half the

university's total enrollment, fled the campus.<p>



	The university administration posted a notice pointing out that, by its

charter, the university was open to all qualified students regardless of race,

sex, social origin, language, politics, or philosophical opinion. But Hutu

students scrawled the words "Not possible for Tutsis" across this notice.<p>



	The emotion and lack of reason in the situation were demonstrated a few weeks

later when three foreign correspondents asked a group of Hutu students on

campus to explain the "several reasons" for expelling the Tutsis. The students

waved their hands wildly at the correspondents and shouted, "Reasons . . .

reasons . . . reasons!" at them. They refused to answer any more questions and

ordered the journalists' taxi driver to take them away.<p>



	Rwanda's troubles finally triggered a coup in July this year. Like most

Rwandan soldiers, General Juvenal Habyarimana, the army commander and Minister

of Defense who took over the government, was a northern Hutu. Since northern

Rwanda was not conquered by the Tutsis until well into the twentieth century,

northerners look on themselves as more militantly Hutu and less tainted by

Tutsi intermarriage than southern Hutus. For years, northerners have complained

that the southern-dominated government was not doing enough to keep the Tutsis

down. That attitude may have been a major reason for the coup.<p>



	In Burundi, the Tutsis are still not safely in power. Like the whites in

Rhodesia or South Africa, they are vastly outnumbered. While the massacres last

year may have weakened the Hutus, it also may have made them more political,

more resentful, and more eager for revenge. As this year's border incursions

show, this may be especially true of Hutu refugees. These incursions, in fact,

have angered the Burundians and led to skirmishes between Burundian and

Tanzanian soldiers at the border this year.<p>



<p>



<b>Whimpers</b><p>



<p>



	One of the strangest sides to all the bloodshed between the Tutsis and Hutus

has been the feeble reaction of the rest of the world. Last year's slaughter in

Burundi must rank with the most terrible in history. Yet Christian missionaries

kept quiet or muted their concern. Most foreign governments, including the

United States, refused to protest in public at the time. Two African countries,

Zaire and Tanzania, even rushed military help to the government that was doing

the killing. Almost all foreign aid continued to flow into Burundi. European

businessmen kept playing golf in Bujumbura.<p>



	It is not difficult to imagine the outcry in the world today if the whites who

run the government of South Africa had decided to put down a rebellion and

guarantee their control by killing all black South Africans with any education,

wealth, or potential for leadership. Yet the events in Burundi provoked only a

few whimpers of protest.<p>



	Missionaries and other religious leaders showed the most surprising restraint,

for in the past they have been in the forefront of those exposing injustice in

Africa to the rest of the world. In Burundi, one of the most Christian

countries in Africa, missionaries were afraid that if they spoke out they might

lose their hold. Silence was the price they had to pay, they felt, to expand

Christianity in Burundi.<p>



	An American Protestant missionary reluctantly granted an interview early this

year. He said that Protestant missionaries were in a precarious position in

Burundi. Government leaders, who are mostly Catholic, suspect them of stirring

up trouble among the Hutus. He paid tribute to the American Embassy in

Bujumbura for trying to keep stories about the massacres away from the American

press. He said that if the news had been splashed in American newspapers, the

Burundi government might have blamed the one hundred American Protestant

missionaries and expelled them.<p>



	Yet, a few minutes later, he complained that the rest of the world had ignored

what had happened in Burundi. How could he praise the American Embassy for

withholding the news and then lament the fact that foreigners ignored the

event? The missionary shrugged.<p>



	He was asked how he could go on working in Burundi. Many victims were

Christians. The government had slaughtered Hutus whom he had trained for years.

Put on the defensive, the missionary laughed nervously. "I suppose you could

say that's our job,' he said, "preparing people to die."<p>



	Catholic leaders did not remain silent, but they did not say very much,

either. Statements deploring the strife came from Pope Paul, the papal nuncio

in Bujumbura, and the five bishops of Burundi. But all were guarded and mild.

Against the enormity of what happened in Burundi, the Catholic pronouncements

were ineffectual. They hardly amounted to any kind of condemnation.<p>



	The reaction of the U.S. government to the events was typical of most foreign

governments. Thomas P. Melady, who was then the American Ambassador, believed

that his first responsibility was protecting the one hundred and fifty

Americans in Burundi. Soon after the killings began, he rebuked the American

Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, for briefing American correspondents there about the

troubles. Melady feared that news reports in American newspapers would be

easily traced by the Burundi government to the American Embassy in Bujumbura

and its main sources, the American missionaries. The clamp on the news became

so tight that Senator Edward M. Kennedy complained in June, 1972, that the

State Department was even withholding from Congress its information on the

massacres.<p>



	The United States did not criticize Burundi in public until May, 1973, when

President Nixon made a small reference to the troubles in his annual

foreign-policy report to Congress. ". . . Countries have a right to take

positions of conscience," Nixon wrote. "We would have expected that the first

responsibility for taking such positions rested upon the African nations,

either individually or collectively. The United States urged African leaders to

address the problem of the killings in Burundi. . . . All of the African leaders

we spoke to voiced their concern to us; some raised it with Burundi's leaders.

But ultimately none spoke out when these diplomatic efforts failed." Nixon

neglected to mention that, in this matter of conscience, the United States had

also refused to speak out when its diplomatic efforts, such as they were,

failed.<p>



	The U.S. government avoided the issue by persuading itself that the killings

were an African problem. If African governments chose to ignore it, American

officials reasoned, why should the U.S. government make an issue of it?

Moreover, American officials believed that protest was futile.<p>



	The United States did suspend a fund of $25,000 in foreign aid that it allots

every year to the Ambassador to finance small projects around the countryside.

But the United States will supply $300,000 worth of relief to Burundi this

year, mostly in surplus food. American officials insist this will be

distributed only to the widows and orphans of the victims. But an American

relief worker who does the actual distributing said: "Good God, I can't

discriminate between Tutsis and Hutus. I have to give the food to whoever needs

it, in every part of the country. I can't give the food only to Hutus."<p>



	Belgium was the only Western country to react differently. The former colonial

power in Burundi, Belgium is the largest donor of foreign aid and has the

greatest number of nationals living there, about three thousand. In May, 1972,

Premier Gaston Eyskens of Belgium denounced the massacres as "veritable

genocide" and threatened to cut off Belgian aid, which amounts to $4.5 million

a year. In the end the threat was not carried out. The Belgians did withdraw

their thirty-five advisers from the Burundi army, less to punish Burundi than

to placate Belgian public opinion. But, aside from this, Belgian aid was

neither withdrawn nor cut substantially.<p>



	Belgian officials took the view of most foreigners supplying aid to Burundi.

They insisted that punishing the government by withdrawing assistance would

only hurt the masses. "If we cut foreign aid," said an official from another

country, "you will only have misery here. If you put a curtain around this

country, it will be worse." As a result, the United Nations, the Common Market,

France, and West Germany, like Belgium, have all maintained foreign-aid

programs in Burundi.<p>



	Almost all African governments reacted in a predictable way. As usual in cases

of African disorder, the governments either ignored the massacres or pledged

support to the Micombero government. In fact, Zaire rushed troops to Bujumbura,

and Tanzania sent ammunition. The reason was simple: African leaders did not

want to break their facade of Black African unity.<p>



<p>



<b>Leverage</b><p>



<p>



	It would be foolish now to be optimistic about the future of Rwanda and

Burundi. Systematic murder of the ethnic enemy has become a legitimate

political weapon in both countries. Since neither has solved its ethnic

problems, it is a safe guess that slaughter will be used again. The ease with

which it was renewed in Burundi this year is proof enough of that.<p>



	Can anything be done to stop all this? There may be some truth in the argument

by American officials that they and other outsiders have little influence on

what goes on in this part of the world. But it is also true that governments

outside Africa have considerable leverage which they could have applied against

Rwanda, Burundi, and the rest of Africa.<p>



	The United States, for example, buys almost all the coffee produced by both

Rwanda and Burundi, and both countries would be bankrupt without foreign aid

from Belgium, France, Germany, the Common Market, and the United Nations.

Perhaps a coffee boycott or the withdrawal of aid would not stop the slaughter

in either country, but neither weapon has ever been used.<p>



	The industrialized countries could also put pressure on the other African

countries to face the problem of Rwanda and Burundi. They could, for example,

refuse to support all African resolutions on southern Africa in the United

Nations unless these resolutions also condemned the disaster in Burundi and

Rwanda. Perhaps this would only infuriate Africa. But it might also shame

Africa into dealing with its problems. At the least, it would expose African

hypocrisy.<p>



	Finally, there is the question of whether countries like the United States

have the moral right to remain silent while all the killing goes on. Perhaps it

is true that condemnation would have been futile in Burundi last year. But no

one knows for sure. All that is known is that, while everyone kept quiet, more

than a hundred thousand people died. Keeping quiet obviously didn't save

anyone. Perhaps shouting might have.<p>

<blockquote>	
	<B>Beau Geste fort</B> <i>noun, slang</i>, one of a chain of irregularly
star-shaped base camps containing lined wooden-floored tents provided with
power and heat, capable of billeting 1,200- 1,800 soldiers and their 
fighting
vehicles, that have been constructed across Sector Tuzla in northeast 
Bosnia as
part of NATO's peace-keeping Operation Joint Endeavor: "The Army has 
contracted
with a civilian construction firm to build its base camps, dubbed `<i>Beau
Geste forts</i>'<i> </i>by one wag, referring to the . . . forts of a Gary
Cooper movie" (<i>Washington Post</i>).<p>
	
	BACKGROUND: The 1939 movie <i>Beau Geste </i>centers on the experiences 
of the
three Geste brothers (Beau is the eldest), who join the French Foreign 
Legion.
While defending a Legion outpost in the Sahara, two of them come under 
fierce
attack by Arab forces. The use of the film's title to designate these new 
NATO
bases is significant in view of the troops' mission and the film's genre. 
As
one critic has put it, <i>Beau Geste </i>is one of the "imperial epics" of 
the
late 1930s--movies in which "the civilized order is embodied by a military
outpost."<p>
	
	<B>para-parenting</B> <i>noun</i>, <b>1</b>) a close relationship between a 
single adult and
an unrelated child, which can be crucial to creating a normal childhood in 
a
family stressed by economic hardship or divorce: "Child care experts are 
just
now beginning to give proper recognition to . . . unformalized, often
serendipitous `<i>para-parenting</i>' . . . that bind[s] children and 
single
adults. These relationships are most often seen in low-income families . . 
. ,
but they are becoming more common in middle-income families, too" (<i>New 
York
Times</i>).<p>
<b>2</b>) the assumption by a child of household responsibilities in lieu of a 
working
parent or set of parents: "Kids are alone more and tend to be decision 
makers
when a weary mom phones home to ask what they want for dinner. And the 
number
of single-parent households has shot up from 29 percent to 44 percent, 
putting
the burden of `<i>para-parenting</i>,' or filling in for an absent parent, 
on
the child" (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>).<p>
	
	BACKGROUND: <i>Para-parenting</i> in the first sense can involve 
babysitting,
reading to the child, or taking care of doctors' appointments. It can also
entail providing luxuries that the biological parent cannot afford, such as
dancing or ice-skating lessons or even private-school tuition. Collateral 
terms
include <i>psychological parent</i>, <i>nonfamilial parent</i>, and
<i>surrogate parent </i>(all referring to the mentor); <i>recruiter kid 
</i>(a
child who, often quite deliberately, <i>semi-adopts </i>a nonfamilial adult
mentor); and <i>informal adoption </i>(the relationship itself). The second
sense of <i>para-parenting </i>is associated with another new word:
<i>filiarchy</i>, "the rule of the child."<p>
	
	<B>sero-discordant</B> <i>adj.</i>, of, relating to, or being a 
relationship involving one HIV-positive and one HIV-negative partner: 
"Without understating the specter of death, <i>sero-discordant </i>couples 
are more likely to dwell on
long-term survival" (<i>New York Times</i>).<p>
	
	BACKGROUND: Despite the presence of the word <i>discordant </i>in this
compound, the term actually denotes accord and cohesion. According to a
spokesman at Body Positive of New York, a service organization for people
infected with HIV, a growing number of <i>sero-discordant </i>couples are
remaining together, and hoping, of course, for a means of stabilizing the
HIV-positive condition or for a cure.<p>
	
	<B>work plane</B> <i>noun</i>, a desk on wheels, for use in offices where 
employees
commonly work in flexible teams: "In catering to teamwork management, the
companies that constitute the $9 billion-a-year North American 
office-furniture
industry are creating equipment with a whole new nomenclature. . . . [A] 
desk
is no longer a desk: it's a `<i>work plane</i>'" (<i>Wall Street
Journal</i>).<p>
	
	BACKGROUND: A variety of easily portable furniture has been designed to 
meet
the demands of a changing work environment, one that is increasingly 
populated
by <i>mobiles</i> (on- and chiefly off-site workers) and <i>teamers</i>. 
Such
furniture fits into both <i>commons </i>(shared work spaces) and <i>caves
</i>(private offices). Among the items intended for <i>teaming spaces 
</i>are
wheeled <i>work nests </i>(work areas consisting of a mixture of rolling
components), <i>stowaways </i>or <i>puppies </i>(rolling storage cabinets 
that
can follow their users from one work station to another), <i>perimeters
</i>(screens that can be attached to walls or to temporary partitions, or 
used
standing alone), <i>fences </i>(systems for managing electrical and phone
wires, which are also useful in defining the boundaries of work areas), and
<i>scaffolds </i>(ladderlike <i>perimeters </i>that are really partitions
customized for a given worker's office equipment).<p>

<blockquote>
	
	<font size=5>T</font>HOMAS Jefferson was a methodical man all his life, and when he came to the end
of that life, so crowded with accomplishments, it was perfectly in character
for him to compose his own epitaph -- indeed, to design his tombstone as well.
He wished most to be remembered, he wrote, for three "testimonials" of his
life:<p>

<pre>
      Author of the Declaration of American Independence
         of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom
              and Father of the University of Virginia
              
</pre>
<p>

The inclusion of the statute in such a noble trinity has sometimes perplexed
Jefferson's admirers. Of course he would wish to be remembered for the
Declaration of Independence, which not only gave birth to the new American
nation but provided it with a democratic creed and the world with a philosophy
of human rights. And of course he would wish to be remembered for the
University of Virginia: it was an enduring monument to his genius, not only in
the physical architecture of the grounds and buildings but also in its
educational spirit -- so much so that it bore witness to the truth of Emerson's
aphorism "An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man." But why should
Jefferson include a mere statute, one of the laws of a single state, among the
testimonials of his life? This essay is an answer to that question. And it
maintains not only that the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom belongs in
Jefferson's incisive epitaph but that it is, in fact, one of the main pillars
of American democracy and a beacon of light and liberty to the world.<p>

<p>

Viewed historically, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom is the supreme
expression of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment in the life and work of
Thomas Jefferson. He was a bookish man. In youth "a hard student," as he
described himself, he was no less so in old age. He compiled three libraries
during his lifetime. His great library of some 6,000 volumes became the
foundation of the Library of Congress in 1815. And no sooner had he disposed of
it than he commenced another, saying, "I cannot live without books." Growing up
on the outskirts of civilization, in a kind of intellectual limbo, the young
Jefferson learned from books -- how to design a house, measure an eclipse, form
a government. He extended his experience beyond the narrow range of Colonial
life by means of the new learning of the age and gained a vantage point from
which to perceive, through the eye of reason, things as they ought to be. His
heroes were neither statesmen nor warriors but philosophers -- in particular
Bacon, Newton, and Locke, upon whom the edifice of the Enlightenment was
raised. From his early exposure, at college, to the English and Scottish
rationalists, Jefferson turned to the Continental votaries of the
Enlightenment. Before the American Revolution he read Voltaire, Montesquieu,
Holbach, Helvetius, Beccaria, and others. Later, in the 1780s, when he took up
residence in Paris, the capital of the Enlightenment, he became something of a
philosophe himself.<p>

<p>

The dominant spirit of the Enlightenment was one of skepticism toward all
received truths and of untrammeled free inquiry in the pursuit of knowledge.
"Everything," Diderot enjoined in the great <i>Encyclopedie</i>, "must be
examined, everything must be shaken up, without exception and without
circumspection." The mission of philosophy was no longer to reflect the world,
or contemplate another, but to change it. "Knowledge is power," Bacon had said;
and Jefferson was never more typically a child of the Enlightenment than in his
youthful conviction that reason and inquiry may lead man away from whatever is
false, twisted, and capricious in human affairs toward the truths inherent in
the nature of things. Man had been too long alienated from nature. For
centuries he had been dominated by dogmatic authority and superstition, which
was embodied, above all, in the alliance of kings and priests, Church and
State. Now those false idols were crumbling, and man might take control of his
destiny by discovering the laws of nature and using them in the service of the
species. Newton had demonstrated the order of the physical universe; Locke had
pointed the way to a science of mind as well as of government; Linnaeus and
Buffon had begun to impose system on the chaos of living things; and Adam
Smith, coincidentally in 1776, broached the idea of an autonomous economic
order governed by immutable laws of nature. All such laws were permanent,
universal, harmonious, intelligible, beneficent, so man might feel at home in
nature. The faith was aggressively secular, utilitarian, and progressive, its
end being the increased freedom and happiness of humankind. In the great
correspondence of their old age his glum friend John Adams liked to twit
Jefferson on the exploded hopes of the Enlightenment. But the sunny Virginian
would have none of it. He went to his grave believing that the future would be
better than the past and that the advance of freedom was irreversible. As he
told Adams, he steered his bark "with hope in the head, leaving fear astern."<p>

<p>

The optimistic faith of the Enlightenment informed all of Jefferson's work. We
see it in Jefferson the scientist, Jefferson the educator, Jefferson the
statesman -- all facets of the multifaceted genius. His public policies often
reflected the rationalism of the Enlightenment: thus the decimal system of
coinage with the dollar unit; thus the rectilinear land-survey system for the
Transappalachian West, the effects of which are still visible to anyone who
flies over the prairies and plains today and views the linear patchwork of the
fields below; thus, too, though it was not adopted, Jefferson's methodically
developed plan for a uniform system of weights and measures based on a natural
and universal standard.<p>

<p>

But it is <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i>, the only book he managed to
write in a crowded lifetime, that offers the best avenue into the enlightened
mind of Thomas Jefferson. The book is by itself worthy of an essay. Meant as a
contribution to the European Enlightenment, it was also a prolegomenon to the
American Enlightenment, for here we find Jefferson, in the midst of the
Revolutionary War, embarked upon the intellectual discovery of his native land,
the greater Virginia of that day, which extended from Kentucky to the Great
Lakes and westward to the Mississippi River. A work inspired by the spirit of
the Enlightenment became a vehicle of American nationalism -- of American
self-definition. First published in Paris in 1785, <i>Notes on Virginia</i>
appeared in an improved English edition in 1787; many American editions
followed. Chapter 17, on religion, is especially interesting in relation to our
subject. In it Jefferson gave his own philosophical account of the struggle for
religious freedom in Virginia, a struggle he later remembered as ''the
severest" in which he had ever engaged.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>
<br>

<font size=5>J</font>EFFERSON'S leadership in that struggle commenced in 
the fall of 1776, when he returned from Congress, in Philadelphia, and took 
his seat as the representative of Albemarle County in the General Assembly 
of the newly established Commonwealth of Virginia.  Having set forth the 
fundamental principles of the new nation in the Declaration of 
Independence, Jefferson was eager to embody those principles in the laws of 
Virginia.  He advocated a host of reforms of the old order: a more 
democratic suffrage and equal representation, an open and individualistic 
system of landholding shorn of feudal survivals, a more rational and 
humanitarian code of criminal justice, gradual emancipation of the slaves, 
a comprehensive system of public education, and, of course, 
disestablishment of the Anglican Church and the institution of a new order 
of religious life founded on the twin principles of absolute religious 
freedom and separation of Church and State.  Several of the reforms were 
never enacted.  Old Virginia rejected Jefferson's liberal vision of a new 
Virginia.  After a decade-long campaign, however, his effort in behalf of 
religious freedom was crowned with success.<p>

<p>

The Church of England had been established in the infancy of the colony. There
was nothing unusual about this. Everywhere in the world Church and State were
united, and dissenters from the one true faith, the established religion,
although they might be tolerated, suffered numerous pains and penalties.
Virginia had been one of six American colonies with an Anglican establishment.
That establishment had never been strong, however, and as the number of
dissenters increased during the eighteenth century, the Church steadily lost
vigor, influence, and followers. In Virginia, as Jefferson remarked, perhaps as
many as two thirds of the citizens were dissenters from the established Church.
The Revolution rendered this conflict intolerable.<p>

<p>

Jefferson had been disappointed that the Virginia constitution of 1776 left the
establishment in place. Fortunately, the celebrated Declaration of Rights,
adjoined to that constitution, asserted the true principle: "All men are
equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of
conscience." As originally drafted by George Mason, the article guaranteed only
"the fullest Toleration in the exercise of religion." But at the behest of
James Madison, the young delegate from Orange County, the language of
toleration was dropped in favor of the language of natural right: "All men are
equally entitled to the free exercise of religion." The change amounted to only
a few words, yet it was momentous. The English Act of Toleration, it was
commonly thought, had extended to Virginia. Under it dissenting Protestants --
not Roman Catholics or Jews, please note  -- were allowed to hold religious
services provided that their ministers and places of worship were registered
with the government. The idea of toleration assumed an official religion along
with the right of the state to grant favor to dissenters or withhold it.
Toleration, therefore, fell well short of equality. As Thomas Paine said,
"Toleration is not the opposite of intoleration, but is the counterfeit of it.
Both are despotisms. The one assumes to itself the right of withholding liberty
of conscience, and the other of granting it." On the principle of toleration
nothing needed to be changed in Virginia law and practice in 1776. Toleration
was the status quo. But if the principle of individual freedom and right became
the basis of legislation, there must be a sweeping change in the civil and
religious life of the commonwealth.<p>

<p>

And so it happened. When the first General Assembly met, in October of 1776, it
was flooded with petitions for the disestablishment of the Church and the
removal of disabilities from dissenters. One petition, from Prince Edward
County, looked to the end of "a long night of ecclesiastical bondage" and to a
new day in which Virginia would be "an asylum for free inquiry, knowledge, and
the virtuous of every denomination." Another prayed "that every denomination .
. . be put on an equal footing." The Hanover Presbytery observed that "every
argument for civil liberty gains additional strength when applied to liberty in
the concerns of religion," thereby recognizing the importance of this liberty
to every other liberty. In this campaign the battalions were provided by the
dissenting sects Methodists, Presbyterians, and, above all, Baptists. Their
motives were clearly religious; they sought, as had Roger Williams -- and
William Penn before them, the liberty of their own faith. They were marshaled
and led, however, by liberals and rationalists like Jefferson and Madison, who,
while friendly to religion, were not sectarians, and aimed to secure the
republic and its citizens from the "spiritual tyranny" of any and every
religion. The two groups shared a goal, though for different reasons. And so,
by the unique logic of American history, the seekers after salvation and the
seekers after freedom and enlightenment were allies in the Virginia struggle.<p>

<p>

Jefferson outlined his whole philosophy of the subject in a speech delivered to
the House of Delegates in November. (There is no record of the speech; what
follows is based on Jefferson's notes.) He began with a history lesson on the
evils of religious establishments. Much of this concerned the Old World. But
even in Virginia, he noted, the laws punished heresy by death, and denial of
the Trinity by three years' imprisonment; the law of blasphemy punished
religious belief as well as speech; freethinkers might have their children
taken from them under Virginia law; church attendance was compulsory; and so
on. To be sure, the laws were for the most part dead letters. But that did not
remove the stigma of the laws, and it offered no security against returning
oppression and injustice. The ongoing persecution of Baptist ministers, in
particular, was notorious. These "disturbers of the peace" had been hounded,
silenced, and imprisoned. All dissenters were taxed to support the Anglican
Church. This, too, was persecution. What kind of attachment might these people
feel toward a government that discriminated against them on behalf of a Church
and a clergy associated with the British enemy? Political realism as well as
human right demanded disestablishment.<p>

<p>

Jefferson then posed the fundamental question: "Has the state a right to adopt
an opinion in matters of religion?" Answering with a resounding negative, he
pursued the argument well beyond the original question of a single state
Church. According to the Lockean, or contractual, theory of civil government,
men enter into government to secure those rights they cannot secure themselves.
But religious conscience, being wholly inward and private, is not one of these.
It does not depend upon civil authority. Indeed, it cannot abide coercion, for
religion in its nature depends upon the inward persuasions of the mind. Men and
women are answerable for their religious beliefs solely to God. Jefferson later
gave memorable expression to the doctrine in <i>Notes on Virginia </i>: "The
legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to
others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods
or no god. It neither picks my pocket, nor breaks my leg."<p>

<p>

Regardless of the question of right, Jefferson went on, the State's
intervention in religious matters was harmful to religion itself. Assailing the
folly of state-supported and -mandated religions, Jefferson sounded like a
Virginia Voltaire: "Millions of innocent men, women, and children since the
introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned, yet
we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of
coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites." The
progress of truth in religion, as in science, depended upon the progress of
free inquiry and private judgment over the coercion and error of authority,
both civil and ecclesiastical. "It is error alone which needs the support of
government," Jefferson declared. "Truth can stand by itself." Religious
differences -- the multiplicity of sects and creeds in America -- are
beneficial to society. "The several sects perform the office of a Censor morum
over each other." Religious differences are equally beneficial to religion, for
they set up a virtuous competition among the sects and require them to stand on
their own mettle rather than depending on external support. In the years to
come Jefferson often reaffirmed his belief in the salubrity of America's
religious pluralism. Writing to a rabbi who had sent him a discourse on the
consecration of the synagogue in Savannah in 1821, he spoke of the two great
principles proved by the American experience. First, he said, man can be
trusted with the government of himself; and second, freedom is the most
effectual anodyne against religious dissension and conflict, "the maxim of
civil government being reversed in that of religion, where its true form is
'divided we stand, united we fall.'"<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>
<br>
<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE first contest, in 1776, ended in several small victories. The General
Assembly repealed some of the most oppressive English statutes and exempted
dissenters from taxes to support the Anglican Church. But the Church was not
disestablished, and parish levies on its members to support it were not
abolished, only suspended. At the same time, the assembly reserved decision on
a new issue, a new proposal, offered as a kind of via media between the old
establishment and the radical reform wanted by Jefferson. This called for a
general tax on all citizens for the support of all Christian ministers.
Everyone would have the assurance that his shilling went into the pocket of his
minister, be he Baptist, Lutheran, Episcopalian, or even Catholic. Churchmen,
foreseeing the doom of the old order, hoped to salvage something by creating
the broad foundation of a plural establishment. Always before in history the
establishment of religion had meant official sanction and support of a single
state Church. But now, in the course of religious controversy in Virginia, the
concept took on new meaning: the civil support of Christianity without
preference as to sect.<p>

<p>

It was in part to close off this development that Jefferson drafted his Bill
for Establishing Religious Freedom, in 1777. Two years later, after repeal of
the levies on Anglicans, Jefferson introduced his bill in the assembly. Two
plans were now before it. One, Jefferson's, was a root-and-branch rejection of
any civil authority in matters of religion and an affirmation of complete
freedom of belief and worship. The other, the "general assessment" plan, which
authorized taxation in support of the Christian religion regardless of sect,
did so on traditional grounds -- for instance, the recognized power of the
state to diffuse knowledge, restrain vice, and further the peace and good order
of society. A similar plan for a plural establishment, although confined to
Protestant Christianity, had been adopted in South Carolina the previous year.
In Virginia the two plans came to be identified with the two giants of the
state's politics: Patrick Henry, the first governor, now retiring, and
Jefferson, the newly elected governor. The issue was clearly drawn. But neither
plan could command a majority of the General Assembly in 1779 or for several
years to come.<p>

<p>

The conclusion of the controversy awaited the end of the Revolutionary War. In
1784 Congress sent Jefferson on a mission to France, and James Madison, his
young friend, having just retired from Congress, assumed the leadership of the
reform party in the House of Delegates. Petitions again poured into the
assembly. The assessment plan now had the title "A Bill for Establishing a
Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion," and it had the backing of
churchmen --  those friends of the longtime establishment now reorganized as
the Protestant Episcopal Church --  as well as of the popular hero Henry. He
was such a powerful figure in the blouse that Madison feared the assessment
bill would pass. But Henry was a man of inordinate vanity, which made him
vulnerable He wished to be governor again. Seizing on this opening, Madison
obligingly kicked him upstairs to the governorship. In that office, under the
constitution of that day, he had virtually no influence with the legislature.
This was the good news. But there was bad news. The famed Hanover Presbytery,
which had opposed a general tax, would cease to do so as long as the revenue
was distributed fairly to all denominations. The Presbyterian clergy, Madison
remarked acidly, were "as ready to set up an establishment which is to take
them in as they were to pull down that which shut them out." But for their
suspicion that the bill's primary purpose was to prop up the Episcopalians, the
Methodists, too, though never the Baptists, would have supported it. The bill
made steady progress in the house. Madison waged a desperate delaying action.
Finally, as the session drew to a close, he got the delegates to agree to
postpone the vote on the bill until November of 1785.<p>

<p>

In the spring of that year Madison wrote his <i>Memorial and Remonstrance
Against Religious Assessments</i>. Handwritten and printed copies, without
attribution of authorship, circulated throughout central Virginia. They were
commonly attached to sheets of paper asking for signatures. The <i>Memorial</i>
is a brilliant exposition of the philosophy crystallized in Jefferson's
statute: it proceeds from the same Enlightenment directives of reason and
right, and reaches the same conclusions. Madison maintained that tax support
subverted rather than sustained true religion --  indeed, that it was "an
unhallowed perversion of the means of salvation." And Madison warned those who
made light of the assessment plan, thinking it a harmless halfway point between
the liberal skeptics and the sectarian religionists, of the dangers of
compromising such a fundamental principle as religious freedom. "Who does not
see," he asked, "that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in
exclusion of all other religions, may establish with the same ease any
particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other sects?" The argument
was persuasive. When the General Assembly met in the fall, it received more
than a hundred petitions on religion. Only eleven supported the
general-assessment plan; many others, with some 11,000 signatures, were copies
of the <i>Memorial and Remonstrance</i>. Moreover, the Presbyterians, after
further reflection, returned to the freedom coalition. Support for a plural
establishment had virtually disappeared, and Madison seized the occasion to
reintroduce Jefferson's Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom. It passed with
but one minor change. A senate amendment would have gutted the bill by striking
the preamble, but the house stood firm, and the bill became law on January 16,
1786.<p>

<p>

The statute is in three parts: the preamble, the enacting clause, and a final
admonitory paragraph. The preamble, which is three fourths of the statute, is
an eloquent manifesto -- about 600 words -- on the sanctity of the human mind.
Its subject is not only religious liberty but also intellectual liberty of the
widest latitude. Into it Jefferson poured all his rage against the cant and
falsehood, the corruption and tyranny, that marked the history of the alliance
between Church and State. He declared that religion and government are separate
spheres, "that our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions,"
that to allow government to intervene is wrong and destructive of both liberty
and religion, that it is time for the government to interfere only when there
are overt acts against peace and good order, and, finally, that "truth is great
and will prevail if left to herself." The enacting clause says that no man
shall be compelled to frequent or support any church and that all shall be free
to hold and exercise their religious beliefs without affecting their civil
capacities. The last paragraph is curious. In the spirit of the Enlightenment,
Jefferson repeatedly declared himself a rebel against the past. He believed
that each generation should be allowed to make laws to suit itself and should
be free of the public debts incurred by its predecessors. Yet he considered the
principles of this statute so fundamental that he put future generations, and
future lawmakers, on notice: "If any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal
the present or to narrow its operation, such act will be an infringement of
natural right."<p>

<p>

Jefferson was United States Minister to France when the statute was enacted. He
promptly saw to its publication. Before the year ran out, he reported to
Madison on the praise accorded it. "I do not mean by the governments, but by
the individuals which compose them," he wrote from Paris. "It has been
translated into French and Italian, has been sent to most of the courts of
Europe. . . . It is inserted in the new Encyclopedie. . . . It is comfortable,"
he concluded on a note of pride,<p>

<font size=5>T</font>HE statute laid the foundation for the unique American 
tradition of Church-State relations.  A few words should be said about some 
of the most common misconceptions about Jefferson and the statute.  To 
address perhaps the most common fallacy: it is often maintained that 
nothing in the statute was meant to exclude governmental intrusion in 
matters of religion as long as the intrusion is on a neutral or 
nonpreferential basis.  But that approach is precisely what was rejected in 
Virginia.  And in the statute, after saying it is "sinful and tyrannical" 
to compel a person to support opinions he does not share, Jefferson went on 
to declare that even "forcing him to support this or that teacher of his 
own religious persuasions" is wrong.  Present-day neoconservatives and 
spokesmen for the religious right argue, for essentially political reasons, 
that a common religion is the necessary glue of the nation, that we began 
as a Christian people, and that however pluralist we may have become, the 
survival of the republic rests upon the foundation of Christian or perhaps 
Judeo-Christian belief.  God forbid, they say, that the government should 
regulate our economic behavior, but it ought to regulate moral and 
religious belief.  Again, the whole thrust of Jefferson's philosophy was to 
reject that position, to reject any idea that a shared community of 
religious beliefs or of moral values, other than the value of freedom 
itself, was necessary to society.  He sought to raise the republic on the 
inalienable rights of man, allowing every citizen sovereignty over his own 
mind and conscience.<p>

<p>

Jefferson has never been without critics with regard to his own religion as
well as his politics. There are some (more in the past than today) who look
upon him as an atheist or infidel, and therefore an aberration in the American
scheme of things; they charge that he had a hidden agenda hostile to
Christianity. And so it is said that the statute, instead of aiming at freedom
of religion, actually sought to impose upon the people a new, infidel religion
of the Enlightenment, a kind of secular humanism destructive of traditional
moral and religious values. The University of Virginia, later founded on a
purely secular basis, was widely denounced by clerics as a deistic enterprise
of enormous proportions. Jefferson's own religion was a version of deism, but
he was not therefore hostile to ordinary religious belief and profession. As a
modern philosopher, Herbert Schneider, has said, "The power and eloquence of
Jefferson's writing on religious freedom is due largely to his evident
religious devotion." Unlike the anticlericalism of the Old World, Jefferson's
hatred of priesthoods and establishments did not involve him in hatred of
religion. He wished for himself, and for his countrymen, not freedom from
religion but freedom to pursue religious truth wherever reason and conscience
led, and the more earnest and upright the pursuit, the more respect it won from
him. Jefferson's own pursuit had led him in his youth to a form of natural
religion, and in his later years he adopted the moral teachings of Jesus as his
creed while continuing to reject biblical revelation -- without which, in the
eyes of most believers, he could not be considered a real Christian. No matter.
He said he was a sect of one. At all times he tried to keep his religious
convictions to himself, as he believed everyone was entitled to do;
regrettably, his political foes declined to cooperate and, especially in the
presidential election of 1800, made a great issue of his supposed infidelity.<p>

<p>

The burden of Jefferson's work was on the side of tearing down, and so it was
charged that he laid the ax to the pillars of the established church but raised
nothing in its place. In fact the substitute was already at hand in what was
called the "voluntary system," entirely in keeping with the religious pluralism
of the country. The system had proved itself in Pennsylvania. There churches of
many denominations flourished with only the voluntary support of their members,
and unparalleled harmony prevailed amid the widest diversity. "They have made
the happy discovery," Jefferson observed, "that the way to silence religious
disputes is to take no notice of them." Another part of the experiment, at
least for Jefferson, was broad-based public education. His Bill for the More
General Diffusion of Knowledge, drafted at the same time as the Bill for
Establishing Religious Freedom, provided for a comprehensive system of public
education, from primary schools through a state university. The parish church
would be replaced by the local schoolhouse as the main moral and educational
force in the community. And the citizens, instead of paying taxes to support
churches, would be taxed to support public schools. Unfortunately, this
constructive part of Jefferson's reform program met with defeat in Virginia.<p>

<p>

The Statute for Religious Freedom became a model for other American states old
and new; moreover, its principles entered into the United States Constitution
by way of the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, for which we are largely
indebted to Jefferson's great collaborator, James Madison: "Congress shall make
no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof." As President of the United States, Jefferson in 1802 put a
gloss on the clause which was destined to have far-reaching influence. Writing
to a committee of Baptists in Connecticut, he said,<p>

<p>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and
his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that
the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I
contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people
which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," <i>thus
building a wall of separation between Church and State</i> [emphasis added].
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>

<p>

At that time, and until 1940, the First Amendment, along with all the
guarantees of the Bill of Rights, was held to be a restraint only on the
national government. And so it rarely came into play, since most matters
touching religion, or speech and press, belonged to the sphere of the state
governments. But beginning in 1940 the Supreme Court made the guarantees of the
First Amendment, and ultimately of the Bill of Rights as a whole, applicable to
the states. The justices on the bench and the advocates at the bar were much
influenced in their understanding of the "free exercise" clause by their
understanding of the Virginia statute and the circumstances that had produced
it. As one of them, Justice Wiley Rutledge, said, "The great instruments of the
Virginia struggle . . . became the warp and woof of our constitutional
tradition." The justices also picked up Jefferson's metaphor of "a wall of
separation." Plain and simple though it might seem, the metaphor was not easily
applied to the many cases that now came before the Supreme Court. Justice
Robert H. Jackson once remarked that the "wall of separation" described by the
Court was beginning to look like one of Jefferson's serpentine garden walls at
the University of Virginia.<p>

<p>

The progress of Jefferson's twin principles, of religious freedom and
separation of Church and State, in Virginia s fellow states is another story.
Certain milestones may quickly be noted. South Carolina abandoned its
experiment with a plural establishment in 1790. Connecticut terminated tax
support for parish churches with its constitution in 1818. And Massachusetts,
the original Puritan commonwealth, the home of orthodox Congregationalism,
expunged the last vestige of state-supported religion from the United States in
1833.<p>

<p>

Alexis de Tocqueville, who traveled in the United States at that time, was
astounded by the coexistence of what he called "the spirit of liberty" and "the
spirit of religion" in this country. In Europe, where joined, they were
antagonists; in America both flourished although they were completely separate.
Amazing! Twenty years later Philip Schaff, a German theologian, studied the
matter and concluded as follows: "The vitality of religion [in America] is
owing to its self-reliance, its freedom, and its abstention from politics. The
voluntary system develops individual activity and liberality in the support of
religion, while the state-church system has the opposite effect." Thus the
universal opinion at the time of the American Revolution -- that, in
Jefferson's words, "civil government could not stand without the prop of a
religious establishment, and that the Christian religion would perish if not
supported" -- had been repudiated and replaced by a great new truth.<p>

<p>

Appropriately, words from the Virginia statute are among those that grace the
walls of the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, and its great dome is encircled
by his personal oath: "I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility
against every form of tyranny over the mind of man." Nowhere in the world today
is there more genuine freedom of conscience, and more respect for the
separateness of Church and State, than in the United States. It is a precious
legacy. Nevertheless there are powerful voices in the land which would rewrite
history and undermine these revolutionary principles. More-subtle dangers lurk
in adjudications by the courts. One particular Supreme Court ruling in 1990,
the so-called Peyote Case, which upheld civil sanctions against the use of
peyote in the worship rituals of Native Americans, led Congress three years
later to pass the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, mandating a return to high
standards of state nonintervention. President Bill Clinton, on signing the act
into law, remarked on the "majestic quality" of this reaffirmation of a
two-centuries-old faith in the principles of religious freedom and separation
of Church and State. Thomas Jefferson's contribution to this long tradition was
fundamental, as he must have believed it would be when he inscribed "Author. .
.of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom" in his epitaph.<p>

	<font size=5>T</font>he new reading room of the Folger Shakespeare Library is dominated by a huge

painting of the sort that Oscar Wilde's Lady Bracknell might have characterized

as being of "more than usually revolting sentimentality." Many scholars who do

their research beneath it would share that view. ("I try to keep my back to

it," one longtime reader says.) But when it was painted, around 1792, The

Infant Shakespeare Attended by Nature and the Passions, by George Romney, was a

reflection of the fledgling cult that over the next century matured into what

George Bernard Shaw would disdainfully dub "Bardolatry."<p>



<p>



The origins of this cult are usually dated to the publication of Samuel

Johnson's edition of Shakespeare's plays, in 1765, and the Shakespeare Jubilee

staged by the actor David Garrick in Stratford-on-Avon, in 1769. The jubilee

brought into the open a division that would shape perceptions of Shakespeare

well into the future: the actor's Shakespeare versus the scholar's Shakespeare.

The actor's Shakespeare was a fellow who wrote plum parts, often set to

musically poetic verse. Actors do not seem to have ever doubted that he wrote

his plays for the stage--what else would one write a play for? The scholar's

Shakespeare, on the other hand, could not be revealed in an "ephemeral stage

work," as Martha Winburn England put it; he became apparent only in "the

eternal values of written commentary." The likeness of the author that would

emerge from these studies was of a highly educated man versed in law and

classical literature, fluent in several languages, equally at home at court and

on the Continent.<p>



<p>



In the 1780s the Reverend James Wilmot scoured Stratford and its environs but

could find nothing of the omniscient, cosmopolitan Shakespeare his generation

had created. There were only documents of a propertied country gentleman and

his rather hard-nosed business dealings, disposed of in a distinctly unpoetic

will, sandwiched between church records of his birth and death. Wilmot

concluded that the Immortal Bard could not have been that very mortal man.

Nowadays, those who dispute the authorship of the plays do concede that there

was a "man from Stratford" named "Shakspere" in Elizabethan theater, probably

an actor, though not a very good one. He was, they assert, paid off by

confederates of the real playwright to go back to Stratford and leave behind

the Shakespeare name for the exclusive use of the True Author. No fewer than

fifty-eight claimants to that title have been put forward; because the current

front-runner is Edward de Vere, the seventeenth Earl of Oxford, the authorship

challengers shall here be called Oxfordians. (And let it be understood that any

reference by me to Shakespeare is always to that "man from Stratford.") While

modern Shakespeare scholars have sought to restore the playwright to his own

age and its teeming theater world, Oxfordians carry on the search for

Shakespeare the man of vast knowledge, Shakespeare the well-traveled

courtier--the Shakespeare who overwhelms all in his age: the Shakespeare of

whom Charles Vere, the spear-carrier for his distant ancestor and the family

name, has said: "If you get Shakespeare wrong, you get the Elizabethan Age

wrong."<p>



<p>



The major questions that have been raised and that will be addressed here are

whether the contemporaneous record of the man and playwright is suspect;

whether the "Soul of the Age" (as Ben Jonson called him) was the very heart of

it as well; and, finally, whether Shakespeare was indeed a man of the

theater.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=3><b>THE MISSING RECORDS CANARD</font></b><p>



<p>



There is more about Shakespeare in contemporary materials than about most

others in English Renaissance theater. An ample supply of references to

Shakespeare as a player and playwright establish his position in the acting

company that was under the patronage of the Lord Chamberlain and, from May of

1603 onward, of King James I. Another ample supply of references made during

Shakespeare's lifetime substantiate that his plays were performed in public

playhouses and also in private theaters and at court. Relatively few though

these documents may seem by modern standards, they pose a considerable problem

for Oxfordians--and, as Charlton Ogburn, Oxford's foremost American champion,

has said, "you can't get anywhere with Oxford unless you dispose of the

Stratford man." Ogburn has led the attempt to portray the record of Shakespeare

the man as entirely anomalous, and the documents that place Shakespeare within

the theater of his time as ambiguous or faulty, while suggesting that those

that have not survived might have been deliberately destroyed. These arguments

are a disprovable feast, of which only a taste can be given here.<p>



<p>



For example, Oxfordians question not merely whether Shakespeare had enough

education to be the author of the plays but whether he had any education at

all. Wilmot was the first to discover that there is no record of Shakespeare's

having attended the Stratford grammar school (nor, for that matter, is there

any record of anyone else's having done so before the nineteenth century).

Ogburn plants the suspicion that the school records "would have disappeared

because they showed he did not attend it." In contrast, Oxfordians observe,

virtually all the other dramatists of Shakespeare's age, except Ben Jonson, had

been to university, and Jonson had been a student of the learned William

Camden, at Westminster School. Camden, however, was the second master, teaching

only the lower forms when Jonson attended. Jonson could not, then, have had

much more than a few years of rudimentary schooling before he was put to work,

probably at his stepfather's trade, bricklaying. Nevertheless, Jonson would

become, as we shall see, Britain's most admired playwright in the seventeenth

century, and also effectively its first poet laureate. In the top rank of

classical scholars, he would be granted honorary master's degrees by both

Oxford and Cambridge. Evidently there may be more to both scholarship and

literary genius than a formal education.<p>



<p>



In any event, is the absence of records from the Stratford grammar school

really very suspicious? It so happens that no admission books from before 1715

survive for Westminster School either, and Westminster has been called "the

most fashionable school" in Tudor England. In fact, the only knowledge we have

of Jonson's attendance there comes from William Drummond's notes of his

conversations with the poet, and Drummond tells us nothing more than that

Jonson "was put to school by a friend (his master Camden)." Drummond was the

closest thing to a Boswell that this Jonson would have: none of the admiring

"Tribe of Ben," nor any of his fellow playwrights, thought to tell us more

about the life of this notoriously self-promoting man, who made himself a

legend in his own time. Clearly, the severe critical eye cast upon

Shakespeare's record has been averted from Jonson's.<p>



<p>



One set of records that has survived is Henslowe's Diary, which contains

virtually all the internal documents of theater in Shakespeare's age that have

come down to us. It is actually more of an account book than a diary and was

kept by the theater manager Philip Henslowe, who was also the builder of the

Rose, Fortune, and Hope playhouses. Ogburn asserts that the "names of all other

prominent playwrights of the time...find a place in his diary along with the

names of famous actors and others who would be unknown but for his

records"--not Shakespeare's, though. That three eminent Shakespeareans failed

to cite "another case of an actor of Shakspere's alleged prominence not

mentioned by Henslowe or Alleyn" (the actor Edward Alleyn, Henslowe's

son-in-law and partner) amounts, in Ogburn's view, to proof that something is

seriously amiss.<p>



<p>



Is Shakespeare indeed the only actor not mentioned? We also do not find the

actors Richard Burbage, John Heminge, Henry Condell, and other players who had

performed at the Rose with Lord Strange's Men and, with the addition of

Shakespeare, were to be the nucleus of the Chamberlain's Men. Nor are the

dramatists in the first wave of London theater to be found: Christopher

Marlowe, Thomas Kyd, George Peele, and Robert Greene. Not even Edward Alleyn,

who was the first famous tragedian on the Elizabethan stage and who was closely

connected with Henslowe, is mentioned in association with the stage until 1596.

As a matter of fact, no player or playwright is named in the Diary before 1596,

which certainly explains the absence of Shakespeare: by then Shakespeare was a

member of the Lord Chamberlain's company, which had no association with

Henslowe or his playhouse. No wonder we don't find him in the Diary.<p>



<p>



Those records in which Shakespeare's name is associated with theater always

bring out the creativity in Oxfordians. There is, for instance, the account

book for King James I's triumphal procession through London on March 15, 1604.

The Chamberlain's Men had been taken into the new monarch's service ten months

earlier, and the nine actors named in the King's license, including

Shakespeare, are to be found in this account as the recipients of four and a

half yards of red cloth. Ogburn tells us nothing more of what appears in this

account than that this grant was made to "diverse persons." Ruth Loyd Miller,

another Oxfordian, contends that "the clothe was issued to them not as 'actors'

but as men of 'The Chamber.'" The word "actors" is not to be found in the

account books it is true; but beside the names of Shakespeare and his fellows

the word "Players" IS written, large and grandly. Such matters are important to

Oxfordians, because in their scenario Shakespeare the bit actor had been packed

off to Stratford in the late 1590s, and here, as in several other documents

from after that time, Shakespeare's name heads a list of his fellow players.

They must therefore find some way to show how, when William Shakespeare is

mentioned in connection with the Chamberlain's Men, the reference is really to

Oxford in his not-so-secret identity. In fact, Oxfordians suggest that Oxford's

role in this troupe was not merely as its playwright but as its patron. Could

it be, they ask, that the patron of the Chamberlain's Men was not Lord Hunsdon,

the Lord Chamberlain of the Household, who has traditionally been assigned that

role, but rather the Lord GREAT Chamberlain of England--who happened to be

Oxford?<p>



<p>



Aside from the fact that the actors in what had been the Chamberlain's Men had

been in the King's service for nearly ten months at the time, this hypothesis

also ignores one account of James's procession which makes it certain that the

actors' previous patron was unquestionably Lord Hunsdon. In The Time

Triumphant, by Gilbert Dugdale, which was in print about two weeks after the

event, the author wrote of the new sovereign that he "to the mean gave grace:

as taking to him the late Lord Chamberlain's Servants, now the King's Actors."

This could only be a reference to Hunsdon, who had died six months earlier;

Oxford survived another three months. This is but one of several contemporary

items that leaves no question that the company had been Hunsdon's. The

Hunsdon-versus-Oxford issue, then, is not an issue at all, merely an example of

Oxfordian scholarship that is less than scrupulous.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



One could go on endlessly with examples of how straightforward evidence is

manhandled by the Oxfordians, but let us turn instead to the question put

succinctly by Ogburn: "What about the manuscripts of his plays, which he had

never shown any interest in having printed?" There is little that gets more

attention from Oxfordians than the absence of autograph manuscripts, which they

insist must have had some value to the author. However, there is no evidence

that Shakespeare's contemporaries attached any more importance to their

manuscripts than he did. Certainly, Ben Jonson thought highly of his plays. In

1616, having carefully selected and edited certain of them (and having

rewritten Every Man in His Humour entirely), Jonson published a collection in a

handsome folio volume. "A major principle behind this selection," Richard

Dutton wrote in his book on the folio, "was certainly the promotion of the

image of himself as a serious poet--something very different from a mere

playwright." Nevertheless, although many examples of his literary output in

other forms survive, not a leaf of a Jonson play in his hand has come down to

us.<p>



<p>



Indifference to the preservation of manuscripts was not peculiar to Shakespeare

and his fellow dramatists. In his English Literary Hands From Chaucer to

Dryden, Anthony G. Petti concluded:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

"Even literary figures preoccupied with posthumous fame did not apparently

place value on preserving their holograph manuscripts after publication, much

less their earlier drafts, and neither, generally speaking, did anyone else,

other than close friends, for the cult of collecting literary autographs did

not begin in earnest until the end of the 18th century."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



Petti found English Renaissance dramatic remains to be in a particularly poor

state in every respect, for though "there are references to over three thousand

plays in the Elizabethan and Jacobean period,...only a handful of manuscript

copies survive, and a mere fraction is extant in print."<p>



<p>



At any rate, the manuscript of a play was the property not of the playwright

but of the company that produced it; unless an unauthorized printer got hold of

it first, a play could not be published without the consent of the

shareholders. Oxfordians dismiss this contention, but the two surviving

documents that touch on this, and the publication history of Chamberlain's Men

and King's Men plays, leave little room for doubt that the companies did indeed

exercise control over publication. The one contract between a playwright and an

acting company that still exists is that between Richard Brome and Queen

Henrietta's players. Brome, the contract stipulated,<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

"should not suffer any play made or to be made or composed by him for your

subjects or their successors in the said company in Salisbury Court to be

printed by his consent or knowledge, privity, or direction without the license

from the said company or the major part of them."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



The agreement of the sharers in the Whitefriars Theatre provides even more

important information about a company's determination to control publication of

its plays:<p>



<p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

"no man of the said Company shall at any time hereafter put into print, or

cause to be put in print, any manner of play book now in use, or that hereafter

shall be sold unto them, upon the penalty and forfeiture of forty pounds...."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<p>



<p>



Here we see that even a shareholder, as Shakespeare was in the Globe company

was forbidden to derive personal benefit from what was viewed as the property

of the company as a whole. There is no reason to think that such contracts were

confined to these two particular acting companies. All the evidence is to the

contrary--especially where the Chamberlain's Men and the King's Men are

concerned. In the forty-eight-year history of this company it had four

principal playwrights--Shakespeare, John Fletcher, Philip Massinger, and James

Shirley. Although the shareholders did put plays into print from time to time,

only three plays, all by Massinger, show evidence of having been printed with

the author's cooperation; all three give unmistakable evidence that they were

published with the company's consent as well.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



What seems even more suspicious to Oxfordians than Shakespeare's indifference

to his own greatness is the complementary indifference of his contemporaries.

"To make Shakspere the author," said Peter Jaszi, an Oxfordian attorney, in an

authorship debate in Washington, D.C., in September of 1987, "we would have to

explain away the lack of recognition, in life and at death, that he would have

received as such an author, in London or in Stratford." This seems a perfectly

reasonable idea in the twentieth century, and especially nowadays, when a

person can be famous for being famous, and journalists and biographers will

root through trash to find every scrap of paper that may hold some secret to

this evanescent personality. But the Elizabethans were guilty of something more

than failing to anticipate what our century would want to know about

Shakespeare: there is little reason to believe they shared our exalted opinion

of the Bard.<p>



To put Shakespeare into the perspective of his age, one must recognize that

stage plays were considered things of slight literary merit. In 1612 Sir Thomas

Bodley, the founder of the famous Bodleian Library, at Oxford, took the

library's keeper to task for cataloguing "riffraffs," a category that included

plays. "Some plays," he allowed, "may be worth the keeping, but hardly one in

forty." For although the playwrights of other nations were "men of great fame

for wisdom and learning," such qualities were "seldom or never seen among us."

Indeed, he feared the scandal "when it shall be given out that we stuff [the

library] full of baggage books." None of Shakespeare's plays was among the one

in forty.<p>



<p>



For all the honors that were soon to be conferred on Ben Jonson, when his 1616

folio, The Works of Benjamin Jonson, appeared, a wag posed the famous question,

"Pray tell me, Ben, where doth the mystery lurk,/What others call a play you

call a work."<p>



<p>



Though John Dryden was an admirer of Shakespeare's, he confessed that Francis

Beaumont and John Fletcher "had with the advantage of Shakespeare's wit, which

was their precedent, great natural gifts, improv'd by study," and that for this

reason "their Plays are now the most pleasant and frequent entertainments of

the Stage; two of theirs being acted through the year for one of Shakespeare's

or Jonson's." Whether or not Dryden's estimate is reliable, the Restoration

audiences of Jonson and Beaumont and Fletcher saw the plays as they had been

written. But Shakespeare offended this refined age, violating its idea of

dramatic form and good taste. Not many of his plays escaped thorough

adaptation. The Macbeth that Restoration audiences saw owed more to Sir William

Davenant than to Shakespeare; Nahum Tate's revision of King Lear is notorious.

Antony and Cleopatra was newly made by Dryden to become All for Love. And so

on.<p>



<p>



In Shakespeare and Jonson, the scholar Gerald Eades Bentley set himself the

task of comparing the reputations of the two in the seventeenth century. By

tabulating direct references to the playwrights, their plays, and their

characters, he found that "not only was Jonson mentioned oftener, quoted

oftener, and praised oftener, but his individual plays and poems were named

more frequently than Shakespeare's, though his canon is smaller." Six plays by

Jonson were mentioned more frequently than any work by Shakespeare; there were

more than twice as many references to Catiline as to the most frequently named

Shakespeare tragedy, Othello.<p>



<p>



Well into the next century Shakespeare would be derided "for neglecting the

unities, for ignoring the ancients, for violating decorum by resorting to

tragicomedy and supernatural characters, and for using puns and blank verse."

In 1709 his greatest interpreter in Restoration theater, the tragedian Thomas

Betterton, looked down loftily upon the man who "liv'd under a kind of mere

Light of Nature ...in a state of almost universal License and Ignorance."<p>



<p>



Betterton's opinion appeared in the first modern edition of Shakespeare's

plays, edited by Nicholas Rowe himself a dramatist who would become poet

laureate of Britain. Ben Jonson had left behind carefully edited plays, and an

excellent Beaumont and Fletcher folio was published in 1647; the Shakespeare

folio texts were by comparison poor stuff. Rowe's attempt to put the texts in

order incidentally set into motion the incredible reversal of opinion about

their author. In 1725 Alexander Pope's edition attempted to better Rowe, and

was in turn challenged by Lewis Theobald, with more to come. Finally Samuel

Johnson set his formidable self to the task, for which he enlisted the aid of

several literary scholars. However, not even this titanic effort satisfied

George Steevens (who would collaborate with Johnson on subsequent editions). "A

perfect edition of the plays of Shakespeare," he wrote after the publication of

Johnson's edition, "requires at once the assistance of the Antiquary, the

Historian, the Grammarian, and the Poet." It had not been a hundred years since

Nahum Tate, Rowe's predecessor as poet laureate, had reworked King Lear, which

he declared to be "a heap of jewels...dazzling in their disorder," and Dryden

had removed from Troilus and Cressida "that heap of Rubbish, under which so

many excellent Thoughts lay wholly bury'd." Now the originals of these plays

and their brethren needed nothing less than the efforts of a legion of scholars

to be fully revealed. It was inevitable that someone would conclude that the

author who required such a throwing about of brains must have been quite a

brain himself, at once a master of the classics, of geography, of law, of court

life--of any subject that could be found in his plays. This would become the

Shakespeare of the authorship debate.<p>



<p>



<p><br>



<font size=3><b>A MAN OF THE THEATER</font></b><p>



<p>



At the heart of the authorship controversy is not only what we should expect to

find of the author in his own time but precisely what his special genius was.

Was it essential that he have been a man deeply involved in the world of the

theater (as Oxford was not)? Or could he have been, as Algernon Charles

Swinburne contended, a learned belletrist who wrote for the studious future

reader "who would be competent and careful to appreciate what his audience and

fellow actors could not"?<p>



<p>



Virtually all the support Ogburn can muster for the notion that Shakespeare was

not a man of the theater is from nineteenth-century critics. For instance,

Ogburn cites William Hazlitt's comment "We do not like to see our author's

plays acted, and least of all, Hamlet." Hazlitt wrote this, however, in a

review of a specific performance (by Edmund Kean). In fact, it was Hazlitt who

believed that Shakespeare wrote for the "great vulgar and the small," and that

he did so for those "in his time, not for posterity." Indeed, no one has more

eloquently captured the unique qualities of Shakespeare's theater than Hazlitt

did when he wrote in praise of the "wonderful truth and individuality of

conception" of his characters, each "as much itself, and as absolutely

independent of the rest, as well as of the author, as if they were living

persons, not fictions of the mind." This is precisely what a playwright must

accomplish. And no one has done it better than Shakespeare. Unlike the

narrative poet or the novelist who, in Hazlitt's words, "answer[s] for his

characters himself," Shakespeare created characters who "introduced upon the

stage are liable to be asked all sorts of questions, and are forced to answer

for themselves." Simply, Shakespeare had the power to make a well-rehearsed

actor seem spontaneous, even unpredictable--the power to improvise a life upon

the stage.<p>



<p>



In the search for the dramatist with this singular ability, the singularity of

Shakespeare's experience of theater has been overlooked. Virtually throughout

his known career he was a member of the greatest and most stable acting

organization of his day. Only Thomas Heywood, who fares poorly among the major

playwrights of that era, approached Shakespeare's association of nearly twenty

years, as player, playwright, and shareholder, with a single acting company.

The importance of this relationship is everywhere evident in his plays.<p>



<p>



Early in his career he wrote plays for whatever company wanted them. One of the

Henry VI plays was enacted by Lord Strange's company; Part III was in the

repertoire of the Earl of Pembroke's players. Titus Andronicus was passed

among--in some order--the players of the Earl of Derby, the Earl of Pembroke,

and the Earl of Sussex. Like such early comedies as The Comedy of Errors and

The Two Gentlemen of Verona, these plays can be effective on the stage, but

they have merely flashes of what sets apart Shakespeare's work for the

Chamberlain's Men and the King's Men--the individual voice, the personalized

vocabulary, the rhythms of speech, the almost palpable image of the person to

whom they belong. At the height of his powers, no role was so small that

Shakespeare could not give a special life to it; in Measure for Measure, as

Kenneth Muir observed, "Barnardine is given only seven speeches, Juliet seven

and Froth eight, with a total of only 232 words between the three characters.

But Shakespeare knew that all three could be made into unforgettable

figures."<p>



<p>



For indeed, his characters were "living persons, not fictions of the mind."

They reflect his intimate knowledge of the qualities of his fellow actors. He

knew the actor who would play the part--his look and gestures, the sound of his

voice, the way he moved. Is it coincidental that Shakespeare alone among his

contemporaries created great female roles? For no other dramatist could have

known the talents of his "boy actresses" as Shakespeare knew those of his

Beatrice and Cleopatra, his Rosalind and Desdemona. And after all,

Shakespeare's theater, unlike that of his contemporaries, is a theater of

characters, a world on the stage, richly populated with humanity in all its

variety. His great tragedies Hamlet, King Lear, and Othello were fashioned from

little more than fables; they are not, like those of his contemporaries,

constrained by either theme or plot. Where Jonson's characters "display a

stubborn fixedness, a refusal to change or grow," Shakespeare's creations have

a spontaneity and a mutability that may seem puzzling on the printed page but

that assume a vividness on the stage. It is from these characters that

Shakespeare's plays take their form and come to life. So unapproachable is the

dramatic standard set by Shakespeare that Peter Brook, his most famous

directorial interpreter in our time, has written with evident exasperation, "in

the second half of the twentieth century...we are faced with the infuriating

fact that Shakespeare is still our model."<p>



<p>



The sheer number of candidates put forward as having had the unique

qualifications of position and education to be the True Author is evidence that

these qualifications were not at all unique in Shakespeare's time. And there

is, after all, really very little in Shakespeare's plays that required

knowledge beyond materials that were publicly available. What the authorship

partisans have failed to demonstrate is how any of their candidates had the

intimate knowledge and experience of theater and drama to create plays that

remain the standard by which all other stage works are measured. Those

qualifications are possessed uniquely by the man who was an active member of an

extraordinary theatrical ensemble--William Shakespeare, gentleman of Stratford.

	<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/OP_Home.html

	">B</font>ill Clinton</A> was elected President of the United States on the promise that he

would reform and restore order to Democratic liberalism. For his re-election

campaign Clinton has established a new purpose: to reform and restore order to

Republican conservatism. The Clinton agenda of 1992 required a level of will

and determination seen in recent years only on the right, in such figures as

Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Once in office, Clinton largely abandoned

that mission, and in the election of 1994 the bottom fell out for the

<A HREF="http://www.democrats.org">Democratic Party</A>. What he did not do for the left, he will do for the right.

His bid to lead a reborn Democratic Party into the twenty-first century may

have imploded on November 8, 1994, but his responsiveness to an ever-changing

electorate has found new means of expression--as a brake on the excesses of an

ascendant right.<p>



	<A HREF="clintidx.htm"><img src="../../../images/shorsera.gif" align=left vspace=10 hspace=10 border=0 alt="(Related Articles)">

	

	</A>



With the Republican Congress claiming a mandate to end spiraling deficits,

subsidies for the undeserving poor, and violence and illegitimacy in the

underclass, Clinton now stands apart from both parties, accepting the shift to

the right but determined to protect the elderly and the innocent. To establish

his new persona and purpose, Clinton has acquired a fresh set of advisers. The

1992 team of deeply partisan Democrats--James Carville, Stanley Greenberg, Paul

Begala, and Mandy Grunwald--has been replaced largely by a crew of the

politically ambidextrous: Dick Morris, a Democrat turned Republican turned

Democrat who does not think in terms of partisan gain; Morris's favored

pollsters, Doug Schoen and Mark Penn, who, with roots in New York rather than

Washington, are less mired than other pollsters in the partisan battleground;

and the media consultant Robert Squier, who has watched his clientele of

centrist Democratic senators become roadkill for the new Republican majority.<p>



	<img src="./Politics.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>	

	The 1996 campaign will test whether it is possible to win re-election

amid the wreckage of the lost opportunity of 1992. Clinton's victorious drive

to the White House--a campaign infused with explicit and symbolic messages on

race, values, taxes, responsibility, and the work ethic--laid the groundwork

for a revival of a competitive Democratic Party. Clinton drove home the message

that the party, embroiled in the upheavals of multiple rights revolutions, had

allowed liberalism to become a constrictive orthodoxy, unable to set priorities

or to foster responsibility.<p>



The politics of identity--of race, ethnicity, sex, and sexual orientation--had

taken over the moral core of liberalism. The Clinton campaign sought to

subordinate identity politics to more broadly held beliefs and goals. The

genius of Clinton's confrontation with Jesse Jackson over Sister Souljah, in

June of 1992, for example, lay in his use of the event to affirm integrationist

principle, not to reject it.<p>



Clinton's opportunity upon election was to relocate Democratic liberalism

within a distinctive and resonant American ethic, and to stanch the bleeding of

a political left that had come to stand increasingly in opposition to the

culture and values of a crucial Democratic constituency: working men and women

without college degrees, with incomes at or below the median. In the 1992

campaign Clinton had taken a first step toward bringing white working- and

lower-middle-class voters back to the Democratic Party. These voters stand at

the fulcrum of American politics. When they lean to the right, they empower a

conservative, top-down majority. When they shift to the left, they make

possible a restoration of the bottom-up coalition that led the Democratic Party

to victory for two generations.<p>



These voters determine the shape of the majority coalition in American

elections. When they are persuaded, as they were by the brand of liberalism

that arose in the mid-1960s, that the function of government is to collect tax

dollars in order to finance an agenda tilting private and public workplaces and

schools away from their interests, these voters become a powerful ally of the

<A HREF="http://www.rnc.org">Republican Party</A>. When they are persuaded that government can work to take care

of their future and their families, to foster a workplace with the potential

for security and advancement, and to enlarge educational opportunity for their

children, these voters become the mainstay of the Democratic Party. Republicans

scare these voters away when their policies are seen as favoring the rich at

the expense of the working and middle classes. Democrats lose these voters when

they focus on the politics of redistribution on the basis of sex, race,

ethnicity, or sexual orientation.<p>



The rhetoric of Clinton's 1992 campaign reads like a prose poem directed to

this crucial constituency: <p>



"As President, I'll see that [young people] get the same deal everyone should

have: [they've got to] play by the rules, stay off drugs, stay in school, and

stay off the streets. Don't have children if you're not prepared to support

them, because governments don't raise children, people do." <p>



"I can't be for quotas. . . . I'm for responsibility at every turn." <p>



"I do want to say something to the fathers in this country who have chosen to

abandon their children by neglecting their child support. Take responsibility

for your children or we will force you to do so."<p>



There is a wealth of poll data to document that Clinton, despite winning with

43 percent of the vote, was positioned in the period immediately after the 1992

election to transform American policy. In January of 1993 the Republican Ed

Goeas and the Democrat Celinda Lake together conducted one of a series of

"battleground" polls on a wide range of issues, testing the relative strength

of Clinton and the Democratic Party on one side, and Republicans in Congress on

the other. By huge margins the public favored Clinton and the Democrats over

the Republicans on reforming welfare (by 39 points), on reducing the deficit

(28 points), on improving health care (55 points), and on improving education

(46 points). Clinton and the Democrats even held an eight-point advantage on

the traditionally Republican issue of "holding the line on taxes."<p>



The climate was ideal for an incoming Democratic President. The real

opportunity awaiting Clinton lay in the potential his campaign had established

to break the racial logjam that has become the defining quandary of American

politics. An important subtext of the election had been the preliminary

formation of a black leadership structure committed to policies, rhetoric, and

coalition strategies far less confrontational than those of Jesse Jackson.

Prominent among the new black leadership were the Democratic U.S.

Representatives John Lewis, of Georgia, Mike Espy, of Mississippi, and Bill

Jefferson, of Louisiana; an emerging generation of black mayors, including

Michael White, of Cleveland, and Norm Rice, of Seattle, who were winning office

just as such past leaders as Wilson Goode, David Dinkins, Eugene Sawyer, and

Coleman Young faced defeat or retirement; and growing numbers of state

legislators and city-council members. The new leaders were acutely aware that

Democratic majorities were dependent on biracial coalitions, and that holding

too tightly to liberal social and racial orthodoxies often alienated white

supporters. In addition, these blacks were the linchpins of any Democratic

strategy to enact substantial welfare reform.<p>



In the weeks before the 1992 election the black political community was

undergoing constructive upheaval. "I think what we are witnessing is what I

call a quiet revolution in American politics," John Lewis said. "In the

communities I deal with, people want to win; they want to see a Democrat in the

White House.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They understand that in order to win, it is

necessary to bring back those [white] individuals who had left the party." Kay

Patterson, a state senator from South Carolina, praised Clinton for his

confrontation with Jesse Jackson over Sister Souljah. "I think it helped him,"

Patterson said. "He didn't have to bow down and kowtow to Jesse, and personally

I like that. Hell, be your own man, not bowing and scraping, getting splinters

in your head. . . . Jesse Jackson can shake the apples from the tree, but he

doesn't know how to make the jelly from the apples." Arthur Blackwell, then the

chairman of the Wayne County [Detroit] Commission, who differed with Clinton on

trade policy and the death penalty, asked, "Is it more important for him to

appeal on every single thing and lose, or sixty to seventy percent and win? I

would argue the latter. Having someone like Mondale and Dukakis say exactly

what you want them to say and losing? You should never compromise your

integrity or principles, but you are in the business to win. You have to

evaluate how to win." <p>







<font size=5>I</font>NSTEAD of capitalizing on his election victory to secure the gains he and his

party had made, Clinton undermined both in the initial months of his

Administration. Misled into thinking he had won the war, he began to distribute

the spoils of victory: For gays, he locked himself into providing access to the

military. For women and blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities, he set what

amounted to fixed goals for filling not only symbolic Cabinet seats but also

appointive positions throughout the federal political structure. For the

nation's big cities, he proposed a $16.3 billion economic-stimulus bill. In

support of the goal of empowering women, Clinton turned over to his wife what

would be the most important initiative of his presidency to date--health-care

reform.<p>



The image of a presidency committed more to liberal orthodoxy than to the

public welfare was created not by any single act or order but by the

accumulation of decisions and events: the failed appointments of Kimba Wood and

Zoe Baird as Attorney General, and of Lani Guinier as the assistant attorney

general in charge of civil rights; the immediate recision of executive orders

issued during the Reagan and Bush presidencies which had curtailed the use of

federal dollars in abortion counseling and fetal research; the early presence

of Barbra Streisand and other leaders of the Hollywood liberal community--the

so-called lifestyle left--at the White House; the continuing emphasis by

Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders on the most controversial dimensions of human

sexuality; the abandonment of the pledge to cut middle-class taxes and its

replacement by legislation raising gasoline taxes.<p>



Clinton not only overestimated the magnitude of his election victory but

initially proceeded to govern as if cultural and social post-sixties liberalism

had won, when in fact a moderated centrism had won. The primary criticism

leveled by the American public at the two parties is that each submits

excessively to interests with disproportionate power in its coalition. Such

interests inside the Democratic coalition are seen as blacks, Hispanics,

feminists, the social-welfare lobby, homosexuals, urban political

organizations, government workers, peace and anti-nuclear activists,

criminal-defense and civil-plaintiff lawyers, and regulators indifferent to the

costs, incentives, or market impact of regulation. The interests inside the

Republican coalition are seen as wealthy corporations seeking still greater

power, including unchecked access to natural resources; those who would

restrict opportunity for women or blacks; those who would impose oppressive

moral values on others; and free-market purists who recognize no need for

government protection of consumers, workers, the disabled, or the elderly.<p>



Within this context unbridled contemporary Democratic liberalism becomes

functionally conservative, in that it drives the electorate to the right. When

such liberalism dominates the Democratic Party, as it did in 1972, 1980, 1984,

1988, and 1994, conservatism is the victor.<p>



In the decades from 1968 to 1988 Clinton watched, participated in, and came to

understand the underlying logic of the defeat of Democratic liberalism. In

office, however, he was not prepared to impose on his own party--on his own

friends and colleagues--the costs of reform. The cumulative effect of events

during Clinton's first two years in office was the loss of an opportunity to

revive and enlighten the Democratic Party. A Goeas-Lake battleground poll

conducted in April of last year documented the collapse of public support for

Clinton and his party. The 39-point advantage they had held over congressional Republicans on the issue of welfare

had shifted to a 21-point disadvantage--a 60-point swing. Their 28-point advantage 

on reducing the deficit had become a 23-point

disadvantage--a shift of 51 points. Their advantage on health care dwindled

from 55 points to 12, and their advantage on education fell from 46 points to

nine. Their eight-point advantage on holding the line on taxes had become a

22-point disadvantage--a swing of 30 points. <p>



In the process Clinton lost control not only of the budget and welfare debates

but also of the larger agenda of restoring government to its role as the ally

of those "who work hard and play by the rules." The Republicans captured the

public's interest with their criticism of the Great Society, of cultural,

moral, and racial liberalism, of social engineering, of welfare, and of the

welfare state itself.<p>



Clinton demonstrated in his detailed preparation for the 1992 campaign a full

understanding of the liabilities of liberalism, and he failed as President to

sustain the struggle to reform liberalism. <p>



<font size=5>I</font>F Clinton has a central strength, however, it is the capacity to adapt

politically to adversity and the threat of defeat. He has responded to the

Republican sweep of 1994 by radically altering the goals and character of his

presidency. He has adopted the role of a tactician facing a larger,

better-equipped, but not necessarily better-led army. His daily task is to

determine how much ground to cede to his adversaries on the right while

maintaining his image as the defender of certain core liberal values. The

ground Clinton is prepared to give up encompasses both spending and principle.

During last year's budget negotiations the Administration proposed four

spending plans, each more stringent than the last: the first accepted red ink

deep into the future; the second called for a nominally balanced budget in ten

years; the third provided for balance in seven years, using the favorable

economic forecasts of the Office of Management and Budget; and the fourth

acceded to Republican demands for a balanced budget by the year 2002, using

Congressional Budget Office projections of growth, inflation, and national

savings.<p>



Although Clinton vetoed the first welfare-reform measure sent to him by the

Republican congressional majority, he has signaled a willingness to accept

legislation abandoning the federal guarantee of support for impoverished

children. <p>



The danger facing Clinton is that his presidency will not provide a brake on

conservatism, a fire wall against the challenge from the right, but

rather--even if, and perhaps especially if, he is re-elected--it will first

fuel and then legitimate a revolution that Clinton in no way endorses. <p>



Clinton's presence in the White House has facilitated the work of the

conservative revolutionaries in a way that a fully Republican-controlled

government could not have. In his bargaining with the congressional leadership

Clinton has moved much further to the right than Ronald Reagan would have

considered doing. In the past year Clinton has attempted to structure his

Administration as a rearguard holding action, protecting whatever possible of

the liberal state. In practice, however, he has been a crucial, if unknowing,

participant in an assault on that very state. For both the public and the

press, the bipartisan nature of the debate in Washington gives the prospective

outcome a legitimacy and a protective cover that would not be possible if a

Republican were in the White House with Republican majorities in the House and

the Senate.<p>



The Clinton Administration and congressional Democrats are prepared to treat

the mere survival of a severely cut back Legal Services Corporation as a

victory. The President has signed into law measures that cut spending on the

Appalachian Regional Commission from $282 million to $170 million, that reduce

subsidies for the operating costs of mass transit by 30 percent, and that bar

the use of federal money to pay for abortions for workers covered by

taxpayer-subsidized federal health insurance--except in cases of rape, incest,

or a threat to the life of the mother.<p>



Clinton had by the start of this year acceded to the goal of a balanced budget

within seven years--which by the account of his own chief of staff, Leon

Panetta, "cost us $400 or $500 billion" in future spending authority. That loss

removes any chance of pressing for the kind of social investment in

infrastructure and human capital that Clinton has repeatedly called for in

order to improve national competitiveness and to counter trends toward growing

inequality of income.<p>



The force most likely to prevent Clinton from inadvertently assuming the role

of facilitator is the compelling drive on the right for political, as opposed

to policy, victory. The Republican leadership and freshmen in the House, a

substantial segment of the conservative foundation and interest-group

community, and most of the many pollsters, consultants, party managers, and

campaign operatives are so deeply committed to a partisan takeover of

Washington that they do not see the potential in Clinton to serve as an

unsuspecting ally of their cause. The partisan intractability of these forces

has prevented the leaders of the conservative revolution from taking full

advantage of Clinton's weakened position to win policy achievements in the

budget, on entitlement programs, and on welfare which would have been

inconceivable during the Reagan or Bush Administration. Instead the leaders of

the Republican Party have, through intransigence, given the impression that

they, too, are bound by the orthodoxies of their party, just as the Democrats

are bound by the mandates of liberal interest groups. As Republicans have

pressed partisan interests over policy gains, their party's poll ratings have

declined. In the most recent (at this writing) battleground poll, conducted

last January, Clinton had gained a slight but not comprehensive advantage over

the Republican congressional leadership and prospective Republican presidential

candidates. <p>



The election of 1996 will be driven, then, by forces that the central actors,

Clinton and his Republican adversaries, do not themselves understand--including

their own roles in the grand debate. Largely through his actions in the first

two years of his presidency, Clinton politically empowered conservative

Republicanism. In the second two years he has provided crucial authorization to

the conservative majority in its revolutionary challenge to the social

contracts of the New Deal and the Great Society. Clinton won election as an

agent of change, but the change to be wrought during his tenure is very

different from what he envisaged when he took the oath of office, on January

20, 1993.

<blockquote>

	

<font size=5>I</font>N 1958 Edward Banfield published <I>The Moral Basis of a 

Backward Society</I>, a study of underdevelopment in a village at the 

southern tip of Italy--"the extreme poverty and backwardness of 

which," he wrote, "is to be explained largely (but not entirely) by the 

inability of the villagers to act together for their common good." 

Banfield called the prevailing ethos of the village "amoral familism": 

"Maximize the material, short-run advantage of the nuclear family; assume 

that all others will do likewise." The best way to improve the village's 

economic condition, he said, would be for "the southern peasant to acquire 

the ways of the north."<p>



<img src="./Notes1.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="" border=0>



Ten years later, in <I>The Unheavenly City</I>, Banfield applied a similar 

line of argument to American inner-city black ghettos, without benefit of 

the kind of firsthand research he had done in Italy. This time he 

identified "present-mindedness" as the quality that caused the 

communities' problems. Whereas <I>The Moral Basis of a Backward 

Society</I> had been respectfully received, <I>The Unheavenly City</I> was 

so controversial that for years Banfield required police protection when 

he spoke in public. The lesson seems to be that studying the difference 

between northern and southern Italy is a safe way of addressing a question 

still very much on Americans' minds: Why is there such a wide variation in 

the social and economic health of our neighborhoods and ethnic groups and, 

for that matter, of different societies all over the world? <p>



Robert Putnam, a <A HREF="http://hdc-www.harvard.edu/gov-dept/">professor 

of government at Harvard</A>, has to decide whether 

to confront just this issue. In 1993 Putnam published a book called 

<I>Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy</I>. Though its 

main text is only 185 pages long, <I>Making Democracy Work</I> is the 

fruit of immense labor. In 1970 Italy created local governments in its 

twenty regions and turned over many of the functions of the central 

government to them. Putnam and a team of colleagues almost immediately 

embarked on a study of the new governments' performance, covering the 

entire nation and focusing particularly on a few localities, including a 

town quite near the one where Banfield researched his book.<p>



The finding that leaped out at Putnam was that the governments in the 

prosperous north of Italy outperformed the ones in the benighted south.  

Through a variety of statistical exercises he tried to demonstrate that 

their success was not simply a case of the rich getting richer.  For 

example, he showed that regional government officials are less well 

educated in the north than in the south, and that in the northern provinces 

economic-development levels are not especially predictive of government 

performance.  He found the north's secret to be a quality that <A 

HREF="http://swift.eng.ox.ac.uk/jdr/mach.html">Machiavelli</A> called 

<I>virtu civile </I>("civic virtue")--an ingrained tendency to form 

small-scale associations that create a fertile ground for political and 

economic development, even if (especially if, Putnam would probably say) 

the associations are not themselves political or economic.  "Good 

government in Italy is a by-product of singing groups and soccer clubs," he 

wrote.  Civic virtue both expresses and builds trust and cooperation in the 

citizenry, and it is these qualities--which Putnam called "social capital," 

borrowing a phrase from Jane Jacobs--that make everything else go well.<p>



Putnam was arguing against the conventional wisdom in the social sciences, 

which holds that civic virtue is an appurtenance of a traditional 

society--"an atavism destined to disappear" with modernization, which 

replaces small organizations that operate by custom with big ones that 

operate by rules. Instead, he said, even the biggest and most modern 

societies can't function well if the local civic dimension is weak. He 

hinted here and there 

that it was actually the large bureaucratic overlay that was going to wind 

up being obsolete.<p>



What causes some societies to become more civic-minded than others? In 

Italy, Putnam said, the north-south difference dates from the 1100s, when 

the Normans established a centralized, autocratic regime in the south, and 

a series of autonomous republics arose in the north. The southern system 

stressed what Putnam called "vertical bonds": it was rigidly hierarchical, 

with those at the bottom dependent on the patronage of landowners and 

officials rather than on one another. In the north small organizations 

such as guilds and credit associations generated "horizontal bonds," 

fostering a sense of mutual trust that doesn't exist in the south. Putnam 

continually stressed the "astonishing constancy" of the north-south 

difference: it survived the demise of the independent northern republics 

in the seventeenth century and the Risorgimento in the nineteenth. "The 

southern territories once ruled by the Norman kings," he wrote, 

"constitute exactly the seven least civic regions in the 1970s." We 

shouldn't expect the situation to change anytime soon, because "where 

institution building . . . is concerned, time is measured in decades."<p>



Social science has become a statistical art, overwhelmingly concerned with 

using correlation coefficients to express the effect of one thing on 

another--or, to use the jargon, to discover and isolate the 

independent variable that has the greatest influence on the dependent 

variable. Civic virtue can be understood as Putnam's contribution to an 

ongoing quest for the magic independent variable that will explain 

economic development; he belongs to an intellectual tradition that tries 

to locate it in intrinsic cultural tendencies. In this sense civic virtue 

is a descendant of Max Weber's Protestant ethic, and is the opposite of 

Oscar Lewis's culture of poverty and Banfield's amoral familism. The 

venerability of the tradition and its powerful commonsense appeal 

shouldn't obscure the fact that all such independent variables are, 

necessarily, artificial constructs. Civic virtue is measured (to three 

decimal places!) by cobbling together such indices as newspaper-readership 

figures, voter turnout, and the abundance of sports clubs, and is not, as 

Putnam admitted, all-powerful as a predictor. Even in parts of northern 

Italy "the actual administrative performance of most of the new 

governments"--the subject under study, after all--"has been 

problematical."<p>



<CENTER>

Nonetheless, when Putnam tentatively brought his theory home to the United 

States, it created a sensation--of exactly the opposite kind from the one 

Banfield created a quarter century ago with <I>The Unheavenly City</I>.  An 

article called <A 

HREF="http://calliope.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_democracy/v006/6.1putnam.html">"Bowling 

Alone,"</A> which Putnam published in the January, 1995, issue of the 

<I>Journal of Democracy</I>, had an impact far, far beyond the usual for 

academic writing.  In the wake of "Bowling Alone," Putnam has been invited 

to Camp David to consult with President Bill Clinton.  His terminology has 

heavily influenced the past two <A 

HREF="http://www2.whitehouse.gov/WH/New/other/stateunion-top.html">State of 

the Union</A> addresses; <I>Making Democracy Work</I>, initially ignored by 

the general-interest press, was reviewed on the front page of <I>The New 

York Times Book Review</I>; Putnam was prominently mentioned in the musings 

of Senator Bill Bradley about his disillusionment with politics; and, 

unlikeliest of all, he was the subject of a profile in <I>People</I> 

magazine.<p>



<img src="./Notes2.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="" border=0>



The thesis of "Bowling Alone" is that "the vibrancy of American civil 

society"--the magic variable--" has notably declined over the past several 

decades." Putnam gets his title from the finding that from 1980 to 1993 

league bowling declined by 40 percent while the number of individual 

bowlers rose by 10 percent.  The rest of his evidence is less whimsical: 

voter turnout, church attendance, and union membership are down.  The 

percentage of people who trust the government and who attend community 

meetings has dropped.  The leading indicator for Putnam--membership in 

voluntary associations--is down.  Look at the <A 

HREF="http://www.scouting.org/">Boy Scouts</A>, the <A 

HREF="http://www.lions.org/">Lions</A>, the <A 

HREF="http://www.elks.org/">Elks</A>, the <A 

HREF="http://www.cybercomm.net/~hsherman/shriners.html">Shriners</A>, the 

<A HREF="http://www.sjjc.org/usjcc/index.shtml">Jaycees</A>, the Masons, the <A 

HREF="http://www.crossnet.org/homepage.html">Red Cross</A>, the Federation 

of Women's Clubs, and the <A 

HREF="http://lwv.org/~lwvus/index.html">League of Women Voters</A>: 

"Serious volunteering declined by roughly one-sixth" from 1974 to 1989.  

The logic of <I>Making Democracy Work</I> would suggest that the true 

import of these changes is not that they are inherently unfortunate so much 

as that they predict a broader decline in our society's economic 

vitality--since, according to Putnam, that vitality rests on a cultural 

bedrock of local associational strength.  <p>



Putnam is scrupulously careful in "Bowling Alone" not to push his theory 

too hard.  Earlier this year, though, he stated the thesis more firmly, in 

an article in <I>The American Prospect</I> called <A 

HREF="http://epn.org/prospect/24/24putn.html">"The Strange Disappearance of 

Civic America,"</A> and offered an explanation for it: Americans who were 

born after the Second World War are far less civic-minded than their 

elders, and the main reason is that they grew up after the introduction of 

television, which "privatizes our leisure time." Putnam is now working up a 

book on the subject.<p>

"Bowling Alone" struck a nerve in part because it provided a 

coherent theory to explain the dominant emotion in American politics: a 

feeling that the quality of our society at the everyday level has 

deteriorated severely. An economic statistic like the "misery index" 

doesn't match the political mood; Putnam's theory does. It is especially 

appealing to liberal politicians, who see in it the possibility of a 

rhetoric they can use to address an issue that has been owned by 

conservatives. Also, if Putnam is right that as local associations go, so 

goes the nation, his work suggests the possibility of solving our problems 

through relatively low-cost association-strengthening local initiatives 

that don't require higher taxes. This makes a wonderful message for 

Democrats, who want to offer a positive program that is not vulnerable to 

anti-tax rhetoric. Foundation executives, who want to believe that the 

limited grants they make can reap large social benefits, also tend to be 

Putnam fans. Even people whose interests aren't directly affected have 

eagerly subscribed to the theory of "Bowling Alone," partly because of its 

apparent validity and partly for reasons I'll discuss later.<p>



It must be said, however, that the talk about "Bowling Alone," and to a 

lesser extent the article itself, directly contradict the logic of 

<I>Making Democracy Work</I>.  In Putnam's Italian model the kind of 

overnight deterioration of civic virtue that he proposes regarding America 

would be inconceivable--once civic virtue is in place it is incredibly 

durable over the centuries.  Putnam heartily endorses a theory from 

economic history called "path dependence," which he has summarized this 

way: "Where you can get to depends on where you're coming from, and some 

destinations you simply cannot get to from here." In "Bowling Alone" he 

quotes <A 

HREF="http://darwin.clas.virginia.edu/~tsawyer/DETOC/home.html">Tocqueville</A>'s 

view that "nothing .  .  .  deserves more attention" than Americans' 

amazing associational predilections; by the standards of <I>Making 

Democracy Work</I>, these ought to have held us in good stead well into the 

next century.  Putnam plainly believes that we were in pretty good 

associational shape as recently as 1960.  How can a tendency toward civic 

engagement vanish in a single generation?<p>



Not only was Putnam in <I>Making Democracy Work</I> insistent upon the 

lasting good effects of civic virtue, but he was elaborately pessimistic 

about the possibility of establishing civic virtue where it doesn't 

already exist. He predicted disaster in the former Communist dictatorships 

of Europe, because of their weakness in the local-associational area: 

"Palermo may represent the future of Moscow." Putnam drew this lesson from 

a comprehensive survey of Third World development efforts: <p>





<BLOCKQUOTE>

Unhappily from the point of view of social engineering . . . local 

organizations 'implanted' from the outside have a high failure rate. The 

most successful local organizations represent indigenous, participatory 

initiatives in relatively cohesive local communities.<p>

If Putnam was right the first time, and civic virtue is deeply 

rooted, then it's worth wondering whether the United States might actually 

still have as much of it as ever, or nearly. If that is the case, the dire 

statistics in "Bowling Alone" reflect merely a mutation rather than a 

disappearance of civic virtue, because civic virtue has found new 

expressions in response to economic and social changes. From bowling 

leagues on up, many of the declining associations Putnam mentions are like 

episodes of <I>The Honeymooners </I>seen today--out of date.<p>



<img src="./Notes3.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="" border=0>



I spent a couple of days phoning around in search of examples of new 

associations that have sprung up to take their place. Putnam mentions 

several of these in "Bowling Alone" in order to dismiss them as real 

replacements for the lost bowling leagues, either because they don't 

involve regular face-to-face contact (the many associations in cyberspace; 

the 33-million-member <A 

HREF="http://dol.gov/dol/oaw/public/nonregs/service.providers/nat-001.txt">American 

Association of Retired Persons</A>) or because they don't encourage people 

to build lasting ties based on mutual strength (Alcoholics Anonymous and other 

support groups).  The most dramatic example I could find--and a nicely 

apposite one, too--is <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/usysoccer/">U.S.  

Youth Soccer</A>, which has 2.4 million members, up from 1.2 million ten years ago 

and from 127,000 twenty years ago. As a long-standing coach in this 

organization, I can attest that it involves incessant meetings, phone 

calls, and activities of a kind that create links between people which 

ramify, in the manner described by Putnam, into other areas.<p>



Another intriguing statistic is the number of restaurants in the United 

States, which has risen dramatically, from 203,000 in 1972 to 368,000 in 

1993. True, this probably means that fewer people are eating a family 

dinner at home. But from Putnam's perspective, that might be good news, 

because it means that people who are eating out are expanding their civic 

associations rather than pursuing amoral familism. (If you've ever visited 

northern Italy, the connection between restaurants and <I>virtu civile</I> 

seems obvious.) The growth in restaurants is not confined to fast-food 

restaurants, by the way, although it is true that the number of bars and 

taverns--institutions singled out for praise in "Bowling 

Alone"--has declined over the past two decades.<p>



The number of small businesses--what the <A 

HREF="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/search/index.html">Internal Revenue 

Service</A> calls "non-farm proprietorships"--has about doubled since 1970.  

These can be seen as both generators and results of civic virtue, since 

they involve so much personal contact and mutual trust.  A small subset, <A 

HREF="http://www.cued.org/cued/">Community Development Corporations</A> 

(organizations that are often explicitly Putnamlike schemes to promote 

association locally in the hope of a later economic payoff), have grown in 

number from 500 to 2,200 over the past twenty years.  Individual 

contributions to charity, which are still made by more than three quarters 

of Americans, grew from $16.2 billion in 1970 to $101.8 billion in 1990.  

Although church attendance is, as Putnam says, down, the <A 

HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/Religion/Christianity/Pentecostal/Churches/">Pentecostal</A> 

denominations are booming: their domestic membership has burgeoned over the 

past quarter century.  Little League membership has increased every year.  

Membership in the <A HREF="http://www.pta.org/">PTA</A> has risen over the 

past decade or so, though it's still far below its peak, which occurred in 

1962&#173;1963.  Homeownership is high and steady, and, as Putnam admits in 

"Bowling Alone," Americans move less frequently now than they did in the 

1950s and 1960s.<p>



<CENTER>

<h1>

<B>.    .    .</B>

</h1>

</CENTER>



Weighed against all this, the statistics in "Bowling Alone" are 

still impressive, and no doubt Putnam will nail down his case in his book. 

Let's say, however, for the sake of argument, that Putnam's thesis that 

civic virtue is rapidly collapsing in America isn't true. What would 

account for its being so widely and instantly accepted as gospel?<p>



Bowling leagues, Elks and Lions, and the League of Women Voters are 

indisputably not what they used to be. Large internal population shifts 

have taken place since the 1960s: to the Sunbelt and, within metropolitan 

areas, to the suburbs. Birth rates dropped substantially and then rose 

again. Most mothers now work. All these changes could have resulted in 

atrophied forms of association that are culturally connected to older 

cities and to old-fashioned gender roles (bowling leagues are a good 

example), while other forms more oriented to open space and to weekends 

(like youth soccer) have grown. <p>



I have lived in five American cities: New Orleans, Cambridge, Washington, 

Austin, and Pelham, New York. The two that stand out in my memory as most 

deficient in the Putnam virtues--the places where people I know tend 

not to have elaborate hobbies and not to devote their evenings and 

weekends to neighborhood meetings and activities--are <A 

HREF="http://www.ci.cambridge.ma.us/">Cambridge</A> and <A 

HREF="http://www.dchomepage.net/">Washington</A>. The reason is that these places are the big time. Work absorbs 

all the energy. It is what people talk about at social events. Community 

is defined functionally, not spatially: it's a professional peer group 

rather than a neighborhood. Hired hands, from nannies to headmasters to 

therapists, bear more of the civic-virtue load than is typical.<p>



To people living this kind of life, many of whom grew up in a bourgeois 

provincial environment and migrated to one of the capitals, the "Bowling 

Alone" theory makes sense, because it seems to describe their own 

situation so well. It is natural for people to assume that if their own 

life trajectories have been in the direction of reduced civic virtue, this 

is the result not of choices they have made but of a vast national trend. 

I wonder if the pre-presidential Bill Clinton--the man who spent the 

morning after Election Day in 1992 wandering around Little Rock engaging 

in front-porch visits with lifelong friends--would have found "Bowling 

Alone" so strongly 

resonant.<p>



A second reason for the appeal of "Bowling Alone" is that it avoids the 

Banfield problem. A true application of the line of thinking in <I>Making 

Democracy Work</I> would require searching the United States for internal 

differences in civic virtue and then trying to explain those differences. 

One inevitable result would be the shining of a harsh spotlight on the 

ghettos, with their high rates of crime, welfare dependency, and family 

breakup. In an article that appeared in <I>The American Prospect</I> in 

1993 Putnam made a point of saying, "It would be a dreadful mistake, of 

course, to overlook the repositories of social capital within America's 

minority communities." This doesn't mean that the spotlight wouldn't still 

fall on the ghettos, because Putnam was clearly referring to minority 

communities most of whose members are not poor. But with this caveat he 

demonstrates at least that he is aware of the sensitive areas into which 

his Italian inquiry could lead in the United States. So far he has 

resolutely kept his examples of the decline of civic virtue in America in 

the realm of middle- or even upper-middle-class culture.<p>



In the <A 

HREF="http://epn.org/prospect/13/13putn.html">1993 <I>American Prospect</I> 

article</A> Putnam wrote, <p>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

Classic liberal social policy is designed to enhance the opportunities of 

<I>individuals</I>, but if social capital is important, this emphasis is 

partially misplaced. Instead we must focus on community development, 

allowing space for religious organizations and choral societies and Little 

Leagues that may seem to have little to do with politics or economics.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>





With respect to the United States, the opposite of Putnam's theory would 

be this: There has been relatively little general decline in civic virtue. 

To the extent that the overall civic health of the nation did deteriorate, 

the dip was confined mainly to the decade 1965 to 1975--when, for 

example, crime and divorce rates rose rapidly--and things have been 

pretty stable since then. The overwhelming social and moral problem in 

American life is instead the disastrous condition of poor neighborhoods, 

almost all of which are in cities.<p>



The model of a healthy country and needy ghettos would suggest a program 

much closer to the "liberal social policy" from which Putnam wants us to 

depart. Rather than assume, with Putnam, that such essential public goods 

as safety, decent housing, and good education can be generated only from 

within a community, we could assume that they might be provided from 

without--by government. If quite near the ghettos are working-class 

neighborhoods (and not insuperably distant are suburbs) of varying ethnic 

character and strong civic virtue, then the individual-opportunity model 

might be precisely the answer for ghetto residents--opportunity, that 

is, to move to a place that is part of the healthy American mainstream. 

<p>



The difficulty with such a program is that it is politically inconvenient. 

It would involve, by contemporary standards, far too much action on the 

part of the government, with the benefits far too skewed toward blacks. 

The model of an entire United States severely distressed in a way that is 

beyond the power of government to correct is more comforting.<p>

	<font size=5>O</font>N July 16, 1964, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, approached the podium
at the San Francisco Cow Palace to accept the Republican presidential
nomination. Many moderates in the audience expected a conciliatory speech
pledging party unity. But Goldwater gave them something very different. "I
would remind you," he thundered, "that extremism in the defense of liberty is
no vice. And . . . moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue." Liberal
Republicans were shocked. The party they had controlled for so long had fallen
into the hands of extremists. Political commentators were equally taken aback.
After hearing the speech, one reporter expressed their dismay: "My God, he's
going to run as Barry Goldwater."<p>

In the late 1950s and early 1960s conservatives were widely dismissed as
"kooks" and "crackpots" with no hope of winning political power. In 1950 the
literary critic Lionel Trilling spoke for a generation of scholars and
journalists when he wrote that "in the United States at this time liberalism is
not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition. . . . It is the
plain fact [that] there are no conservative or reactionary ideas in general
circulation" but only "irritable mental gestures which seem to resemble ideas."
The historian Richard Hofstadter echoed Trilling's assessment, arguing that the
right was not a serious, long-term political movement but rather a transitory
phenomenon led by irrational, paranoid people who were angry at the changes
taking place in America.<p>

Journalists were equally contemptuous. In 1962 a writer in the <i>The Nation
</i>suggested that conservatives were more interested in thinking up "frivolous
and simple-minded" slogans than in developing intelligent proposals to meet the
complexities of post-Second World War America. <i>The Washington Post</i>
described members of one conservative group as people who liked to "complain
about the twentieth century." And even a sympathetic commentator in
<i>Commonweal</i> wondered whether a right-wing student group was a new
political voice or "merely a new political organization out to repeal the
twentieth century?"<p>

More than three decades later Americans are still struggling to understand the
rise of <A HREF="http://www.townhall.com">modern American conservatism</A>. Much of this is the fault of scholars and
journalists. Very little has been written about the rise of the right in the
1960s. From today's vantage point, this is arguably the most significant
development of that decade, yet scholars and journalists have focused almost
exclusively on the new left, civil rights, and the decline of <A HREF="http://falcon.cc.ukans.edu/~cubsfan/liberal.html">American
liberalism</A>.<p>

Allen Matusow's <i>The Unraveling of America</i> (1984) is a case in point. The
author explains that the book is "a history of domestic liberalism in the
1960s," telling "the story of how liberals attained political power and
attempted to use it for extending the blessings of American life to excluded
citizens." He also examines the "great uprising against liberalism in the
decade's waning years by hippies, new leftists, black nationalists, and the
antiwar movement--an uprising that convulsed the nation and assured the
repudiation of the Democrats in the 1968 election." Matusow writes, "Thus, in a
few short years, optimism vanished, fundamental differences in values emerged
to divide the country, social cohesion rapidly declined, and the unraveling of
America began." John Morton Blum's book on the 1960s, <i>Years of Discord</i>,
is dedicated to the "liberal spirit" and is essentially "a reexamination of
American liberalism." And <i>The Sixties</i> (1987), by the sociologist Todd
Gitlin (note the definitive title), focuses on the hopes, dreams, and
disappointments of the new left and the counterculture. "What," Gitlin asks,
"did 'the Sixties'--the movement, the spirit--<br>accomplish?"<p>

These studies have greatly enriched our understanding of America after the
Second World War. But by neglecting the rise of the right they have left us
with an incomplete and one-sided view of the 1960s. <p>

That view is about to change. Mary Brennan's <i>Turning Right in the
Sixties</i> is the first on what will most likely be a lengthening and
important list of detailed studies of the rise of American conservatism. (In
recent years a handful of books have been written about the right, but these
have tended to be sweeping accounts offering few insights into the nuts and
bolts of the conservative movement.) Brennan, an assistant professor of history
at Southwest Texas State University, chronicles the conservative capture of the
Republican Party from 1960 to 1968. In doing so, she not only advances our
understanding of the rise of the right; she also offers a more balanced and,
ultimately, more accurate view than we have had before of the most tumultuous
decade of the century.<pre>
</pre>

<font size=5>B</font>RENNAN effectively addresses one of the central questions in modern American
politics: how conservatism transformed itself from an obscure fringe movement
into one of the most powerful political forces in the country. She argues that
the Trilling-Hofstadter analysis of the right was deeply flawed. By the late
1950s conservatives had established a strong base of support in the growing
Southwest. For much of the century wealthy easterners had controlled the
Republican Party, but in the postwar years a growing number of businessmen and
political leaders from the Sunbelt, many of whom had prospered in the postwar
industrial boom, began playing a greater role in national politics. Stressing
individual initiative, free enterprise, and a militant anti-communism,
conservatives formed a variety of single-interest groups to challenge the ideas
and programs of the liberal eastern establishment.<p>
In the early 1960s conservatives continued to benefit from large-scale social
and demographic changes. In the South the growth of the civil-rights movement,
industrial expansion, and the rise of an urban middle class revitalized the
Republican party. The policies of the Kennedy Administration also helped the
conservative cause. As President, Kennedy courted many eastern business
leaders, drawing their support away from liberal Republicans. He also undercut
much of the appeal of moderate Republicans: his position on civil rights, for
example, was virtually indistinguishable from theirs. As conservatives began to
develop positions on key issues which increasingly appealed to voters, liberal
Republicans had trouble distinguishing themselves from Kennedy-style
liberals.<p>

Much of this is well known, and Brennan recounts it cogently. What she adds to
our understanding is how conservatives transformed themselves into successful
political organizers.<p>
<br>

<font size=5>A</font>T the beginning of the 1960s conservatives were in a better position
than at any time since the 1930s to challenge moderate Republicans for control
of the party. But large obstacles remained. Not only were conservatives widely
viewed as wild-eyed fanatics but they squabbled among themselves, had trouble
articulating a positive program of reform, had few grassroots organizations,
and lacked the funding to make the movement a serious political force.<p>

The year 1960, though, brought a turning point for the conservative movement.
That year Barry Goldwater published <i>The Conscience of a Conservative</i>.
Generally dismissed in the national media, the book stands today as one of the
most important political tracts in modern American history.<p>

As the historian Robert Alan Goldberg demonstrates in <i>Barry Goldwater</i>,
his fine new biography, <i>The Conscience of a Conservative </i>advanced the
conservative cause in several ways. Building on William F. Buckley's
pathbreaking work at <i>National Review</i>, Goldwater adeptly reconciled the
differences between traditionalists and libertarians. The expansion of the
welfare state, he wrote, was an unfortunate and dangerous development that
undermined individual freedom. Suggesting that New Deal liberalism marked the
first step on the road to totalitarianism, Goldwater argued that government
should be removed from most areas of American life. Yet he was no strict
libertarian. Appealing to those on the right who longed to recapture lost
certitudes, he argued that the state had a duty to maintain order and promote
virtue. "Politics," Goldwater wrote, is "the art of achieving the maximum
amount of freedom for individuals that is consistent with the maintenance of
social order."<p>

Goldwater also united disparate conservative factions by focusing their
attention on the dangers of Soviet communism. He wrote,<p> 

<blockquote>
And still the awful truth remains: We can establish the domestic conditions for
maximizing freedom, along the lines I have indicated, and yet become slaves. We
can do this by losing the Cold War to the Soviet Union.
</blockquote><p>

Goldwater rejected the containment strategies that had guided U.S. foreign
policy since the late 1940s, and called for an aggressive strategy of
liberation. Conservatives might disagree about the proper role of government in
American life, but surely they could unite to defeat the "Soviet menace." <p>

Goldwater also dispelled the notion that conservatives were a privileged elite
out to promote its own economic interests. "Conservatism," he wrote, "is
<i>not</i> an economic theory." Rather, it "puts material things in their
proper place" and sees man as "a spiritual creature with spiritual needs and
spiritual desires." According to one right-wing magazine, Goldwater gave
conservatives humanitarian reasons for supporting policies usually "associated
with a mere lust for gain." <p>

But perhaps the greatest achievement of Goldwater's book--and the reason for
its startling success with the right--was that it gave conservatives, for the
first time, a blueprint for translating their ideas into political action. In
his introduction Goldwater rejected the idea that conservatism was "out of
date."<p>

<blockquote>
The charge is preposterous and we ought boldly to say so. The laws of God, and
of nature, have no dateline. The principles on which the Conservative political
position is based . . . are derived from the nature of man, and from the truths
that God has revealed about His creation. Circumstances do change. So do the
problems that are shaped by circumstances. But the principles that govern the
solution of the problems do not. To suggest that the Conservative philosophy is
out of date is akin to saying that the Golden Rule, or the Ten Commandments or
Aristotle's <i>Politics</i> are out of date.
</blockquote>
<p>

Supporting states' rights, lower taxes, voluntary Social Security, and a
strengthened military, Goldwater emphasized the positive in his philosophy and
demonstrated "the practical relevance of Conservative principles to the needs
of the day." <p>

<i>The Conscience of a Conservative</i> altered the American political
landscape, galvanizing the right and turning Goldwater into the most popular
conservative in the country. By 1964, just four years after its release, the
book had gone through more than twenty printings, and it eventually sold 3.5
million copies. "Was there ever such a politician as this?" one Republican
asked in disbelief. <i>The Conscience of a Conservative </i>"was our new
testament," Pat Buchanan has said. "It contained the core beliefs of our
political faith, it told us why we had failed, what we must do. We read it,
memorized it, quoted it. . . . For those of us wandering in the arid desert of
Eisenhower Republicanism, it hit like a rifle shot." The book was especially
popular on college campuses. In the early sixties one could find Goldwater
badges and clubs at universities across the country. Expressing the sense of
rebellion that Goldwater's book helped inspire, one student conservative
explained the phenomenon: "You walk around with your Goldwater button, and you
feel that thrill of treason." <pre>
</pre>

<font size=5>R</font>EPUBLICAN Party leaders, however, ignored the "Goldwater boomlet." Vice
President Richard Nixon, the front-runner for the 1960 Republican nomination,
believed that the greatest threat to the party came not from the right but from
the left. In July, Nixon met with Nelson Rockefeller, the governor of New York,
and agreed to change the party platform to win moderate-Republican support.
Conservatives were outraged, referring to the pact, in Goldwater's words, as
the "Munich of the Republican Party."<p>

A few days later, at the Republican National Convention, an angry Goldwater
called on conservatives to "grow up" and take control of the party. And that,
according to Brennan, is exactly what they set out to do. At a time when
"liberal and moderate Republicans, like the rest of the country at that time
and like historians ever since, continued to view conservatives in a
one-dimensional mode," conservatives believed that Goldwater's popularity, the
rise of a conservative press, and the growing strength of conservative youth
groups boded well for the future.<p>

Increasingly disillusioned with Republican moderates and with the whole tenor
of American political debate, the right began to see organization as the key to
political power. In the midst of the 1960 presidential campaign, for example,
William Buckley, the conservative fundraiser Marvin Liebman, and almost a
hundred student activists met at Buckley's estate in Sharon, Connecticut, and
formed <A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/clubs_groups/yaf/articles.html">Young Americans for Freedom</A>. Within six months the organization could
claim more than a hundred campus and precinct-level political-action groups and
at least 21,000 dues-paying members. Using newsletters, radio broadcasts, and
frequent rallies, YAF had almost overnight become a powerful nationwide
movement.<p>

Had Young Americans for Freedom and other grassroots organizations remained
isolated from one another, their impact would have been weak. But in 1961 the
political activist F. Clifton White organized a movement to nominate a
conservative for President. Traveling around the country, White exhorted
conservatives to seize control of their local party organizations and elect
conservative delegates to the national convention. The movement orchestrated by
White gave conservatives control over the Republican Party and helped to
persuade Goldwater to run for President.<p>

Capturing the presidential nomination was one thing; winning the presidency
proved much more difficult. In the early 1960s conservatives tried to distance
themselves from the radical right. No group troubled conservatives more than
the <A HREF="http://www.tncnet.com/~rsears/jbs/jbs.html">John Birch Society</A>. With organizations in all fifty states, thousands of
members (who, according to Brennan, were "zealous letter writers,
demonstrators, and voters"), and a full-time staff, the society wielded
significant influence. But Birchers, many of whom believed that Dwight
Eisenhower and other government officials were Communist agents, tarnished the
reputations of more-rational conservatives. Buckley understood the problem:
conservatism, he explained, had to bring "into our ranks those people who are,
at the moment, on our immediate left--the moderate, wishy-washy conservatives.
. . . I am talking . . . about 20 to 30 million people. . . . If they are being
asked to join a movement whose leadership believes the drivel of Robert Welch
[the founder of the John Birch Society], they will pass by crackpot alley, and
will not pause until they feel the warm embrace of those way over on the other
side, the Liberals."<p>

But in 1964 Goldwater could not escape the taint of extremism. Brennan points
out that despite their sporadic attacks on the radical right, conservatives
were still political neophytes. Goldwater and his supporters believed that all
they had to do was expose Americans to conservative ideas. But Goldwater had no
positive program, and spent much of the campaign railing against Social
Security and threatening to roll back the Communist tide. Moderate Republicans
labeled him a racist and a warmonger, and Goldwater seemed to confirm such
charges when he threatened to "lob" missiles "into the men's room at the
Kremlin." Perhaps most damaging, the media condemned him as a kook who sounded
more like Adolf Hitler than like a Republican presidential candidate. Norman
Mailer, writing in <i>Esquire</i>, compared the Republican National Convention
to a Nazi rally. The columnist Drew Pearson described the "smell of fascism" in
the air. Roy Wilkins, of the NAACP, told readers of <i>The New York Times</i>
that "a man came out of the beer halls of Munich, and rallied the forces of
Rightism in Germany" and that "all the same elements are there in San Francisco
now." When Democrats mocked Goldwater's campaign slogan, "In your heart, you
know he's right," by adding, "Yes, extreme Right," Goldwater's candidacy was
doomed.<p>

Poor campaign management, Goldwater's image, and the lack of unity in the
Republican Party contributed to the Democratic landslide in November of 1964.
But whereas liberals saw the election results as the final repudiation of the
American right, conservatives took solace in Goldwater's 27 million votes and
vowed not to repeat their mistakes. What appeared to be a defeat for
conservatives was actually a dramatic success: Goldwater had paved the way for
a generation of Republicans by appealing to the "forgotten" and "silent"
Americans "who quietly go about the business of paying and praying, working and
saving." He had also raised new social and moral issues that would prove vital
to future conservative successes. As early as 1962 he lamented the moral crisis
afflicting America, the "meaningless violence and meaningless sex" on TV, and
the barbaric quality of modern art. As Robert Alan Goldberg astutely puts it in
his biography, "It was only a beginning, but Goldwater had begun to validate
the concerns of social conservatives, and in time they would grow bolder in
shaping the movement's agenda." Cliff White, meanwhile, had taught
conservatives the value of grassroots organization and had given thousands of
people their first taste of political action. Out of the ruins of the 1964
campaign emerged a well-organized, experienced movement that was more
determined than ever to win political power. In the mid-1960s movement
activists severed almost all ties to more-radical groups, organized a
tremendous direct-mail fundraising drive, and created a more positive platform
that emphasized the benefits of local power. And, as Brennan argues,
conservatives put themselves in a position to take advantage of the growing
disillusionment over civil rights, student protests, and Vietnam.<p>

By 1968 conservatives dominated the Republican Party. In 1960 Nixon had wooed
those on his left; eight years later he employed the conservative speechwriter
<A HREF="http://www.umr.edu/~sears/primary/buchanan.html">Pat Buchanan</A>, chose the fiery Spiro Agnew as his running mate, and trumpeted
his anti-Communist credentials and his opposition to busing to win southern
delegates. Nixon was not an ideological conservative, but to gain the
nomination he had to appeal to the party's new conservative majority.<pre>
</pre>
 
<font size=5>W</font>ITH so much attention currently being focused on the <A HREF="http://edf.www.media.mit.edu:80/conttex.html">Contract With America</A>,
the <A HREF="http://republicans.vt.com/">Republican presidential nomination</A>, and right-wing militias, <i>Turning
Right in the Sixties</i> will appeal to anyone interested in a thoughtful,
serious discussion of the origins of modern American conservatism. <p>

Brennan is less successful in her treatment of the larger events of the decade.
Her writing is often dry, and one finds missing much of the drama of the
sixties. Brennan also fails to explain why so many middle- and
lower-middle-class Americans were drawn to conservative causes in the 1960s.
Grassroots activism, she makes clear, was instrumental in the rise of the
right. But what motivated so many people to contribute money and volunteer time
to the conservative movement? <p>

Many observers have cited a white backlash to civil rights. Surely this played
an important role, but conservatism seemed to benefit from a complex
convergence of forces, only some of which had to do with race. Unprecedented
prosperity, for example, gave rise to a new middle class that was hostile to
high taxes and to many of the social programs they financed. Social
unrest--most notably urban riots, violent crime, and student protests--also
pushed many Americans toward conservative candidates who promised to restore
law and order. But perhaps most important was a growing disillusionment with
the federal government. Vietnam, deteriorating conditions in the cities, and
forced busing affected the lives of working- and middle-class Americans in
profound and often unsettling ways, and led them to believe that government no
longer served their interests.<p>

Although Brennan's book does not sufficiently address these issues, it is
valuable, shedding much-needed light on a key aspect of the conservative
revival and giving us a deeper understanding of why conservatism continues to
be the most powerful political force in American life.

Tunica County, in the Mississippi Delta, has long been among the poorest places 
in America. But casino gambling is changing Tunica's prospects. 
The rich Delta soil is sprouting golf courses, and if all goes according to plan, 
white retirees will soon be moving in. Meanwhile, blacks, Tunica's majority, 
are not sharing in the boom and are under financial pressure to leave the land 
that their labor transformed from a vast swamp">

	County</A>, Mississippi, was notorious as the poorest county in the poorest
state in the country even before 1985, when Jesse Jackson declared that he had
found "America's Ethiopia" there. Life for Tunica's black majority started out
hard and got no easier, as statistics from the 1980s testify. The county
recorded America's eighth highest infant-mortality rate, the fourth highest
percentage of births to teenage mothers, the highest percentage of people
living below the poverty line, and the lowest median household income. In 1984,
70 percent of residents over the age of twenty-five had no high school diploma.
Nearly a quarter of the houses lacked modern plumbing. The filthy tin-and-wood
shacks that disgusted Jackson rotted along "Sugar Ditch" Alley, named for the
open sewer that ran through it. Such infamy inspired a few federal housing
projects, but in 1992 the county was still a symbol of rural poverty. Tunica's
unemployment levels were among the highest in Mississippi, and many of those
who had jobs did not make enough money to get off welfare. That year more than
half the county relied on food stamps. <p>

	Ten years ago the best that the governor, Bill Allain, could hope for in Tunica
was that "a little industry" might "come in there and employ fifty, a hundred,
or two hundred people" in minimum-wage jobs, but even that seemed highly
unlikely. <A HREF="http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/datamap/28/28.html">Tunica</A>, on old two-lane Highway 61 at the northern tip of the
Mississippi Delta, was so isolated, and its population so miserably educated,
that even state monetary incentives and federal tax breaks could not entice
business. Despite the sign outside the county seat that declared Tunica A GOOD
PLACE TO LIVE, many parents who wanted a decent life for their children
encouraged them to leave. Waiting for opportunity to come to <A HREF="http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/epcd/cbp/map/28/143.txt">Tunica</A> was futile.
<p>

Or so it seemed. Today there is light in Tunica's future. The highway along
which Tunicans once migrated north in search of jobs now glows with billboards
and searchlights luring 1.2 million visitors a month into the Delta. At the
hamlet of <A HREF="http://wings.buffalo.edu/cgi/xeroxgw?Robinsonville+MS&34&49&90&18">Robinsonville</A> a brand-new four-lane access road under a canopy of
sodium lights draws drivers west toward the banks of the Mississippi River,
where an Irish castle, a Wild West town, a Tudor mansion, a circus tent, a
plantation house, a Hollywood studio, and an enormous western saloon--casinos
all--float in a sea of parked cars. Their marquees promise shows by Ray
Charles, Johnny Cash, and Tanya Tucker. A few feet from these spangled
fa&ccedil;ades dark acres of cotton and soybeans spread under the Delta night,
silent except for the bullfrogs and the mosquitoes. Entering the casino lots
feels like stepping out of real life.<p>

"Can you believe this?" one woman asks another, as they shuffle forward,
waiting at midnight for a table in a casino restaurant. "Right in the middle of
the cotton fields," she marvels.<p>

No one dreamed that casino gambling would take off the way it has in Tunica,
says Ken Murphree, Tunica County's administrator. But the county that for
decades could attract no industry has turned out to be an ideal location for
the casino trade.<p>

<p>


In part this is because Mississippi is eager to accommodate gaming. The state
collects only eight percent of its casinos' revenue--among the lowest tax rates
on casino gambling in the country and less than half the rate that neighboring
Louisiana assesses. Moreover, Mississippi charges a casino only $5,000 every
two years to renew its license, whereas Louisiana charges $100,000 every year.
While most other states restrict the number of casinos and their concentration,
Mississippi models itself on Nevada, the king of the gambling states, granting
an unlimited number of licenses and letting the market alone decide which and
how many of the fledgling casinos will survive.<p>

They are allowed plenty of leeway to compete. Mississippi's casinos, unlike
those in many other states, may devote as much floor space as they please to
gambling and may install as many gaming tables and slot machines as they want
to fill. While some states try to legislate against gamblers' tendency toward
excess by forbidding bets over $5.00, Mississippi, like New Jersey and Nevada,
lets its gamblers play for high stakes.<p>

Ironically, Tunica's poverty helped to determine the county's success as a
casino mecca, because it made Tunicans receptive to the notion of legalized
gambling. Throughout the nation casinos have mushroomed in areas that have
despaired of other sources of income. Tunica fits the pattern. When, in 1990,
the state authorized casinos along the Mississippi River and the Gulf of
Mexico, Tunica was the first county on the river to welcome the industry. "We
weren't smarter than other areas," Murphree is fond of saying. "We were more
desperate."<p>

<a name="RTFToC2">a

</a></h3><p>
<font size=5>L</font>UCKILY for Tunica, its neighbor to the north, DeSoto County, was not so
desperate. DeSoto, which had prospered as a suburb of Memphis while Tunica
languished in the Delta, spurned casinos, establishing <A HREF="http://www.decd.state.ms.us/
CASINOS/CASINOS.HTM">Tunica</A> as the closest
gambling venue to Memphis, with its metropolitan area of almost a million
people. Memphians' appetite for gambling has proved voracious. When Tunica's
first casino, a riverboat named Splash, opened in October of 1992, it was
immediately swamped with customers willing to pay a $10 admission fee and to
wait three hours or more to get into the place for a chance to try their luck.
Within five weeks the riverboat cleared $22 million, a huge take even by Las
Vegas standards. Splash was a relatively small, locally owned operation, but
its success attracted the attention of some of the country's largest gambling
corporations.<p>

By the end of 1993 such established casino operators as <A HREF="http://www.vegas.com:80/vegascom/castour/miss.html">Harrah's, Bally's, and
Sheraton</A> had begun to build gaudy palaces in Tunica. They noticed that the
county's location had another advantage--one that is obvious when looking at a
map of the central United States. People living in West Coast and East Coast
cities could be throwing dice in Nevada or Atlantic City after a reasonably
short drive or a quick plane trip, but for people in the middle of the country
big-casino gambling was out of easy reach. Tunica's boosters and casino owners
are changing that. They point out that Interstates 40 and 55 intersect in
Memphis, putting Tunica within a day's drive of Oklahoma and Arkansas to the
west, Georgia and Tennessee to the east, and Missouri and Indiana to the north.
Tunica hopes to become the Las Vegas of the central United States--or, as
Splash billed itself, the "Monte Carlo of the Mid-South." <p>

The astonishing growth of gaming in Tunica suggests that this vision may not be
a pipe dream. Tunica's first casinos were riverboats, essentially no different
from those along the Mississippi River in Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, and
southern Mississippi. Since the big operators have moved in, however, Splash
has folded and Lady Luck, Tunica's second casino, has floated south to Coahoma
County. The new casinos are permanent structures, clustered in Las Vegas-like
strips near the northern Tunica border. Whipped into fierce competition by
Mississippi's loose gaming laws, the new establishments are monster casinos,
with multiple stories, shops, twenty-four-hour restaurants, and elaborate
"themes." Tunica County already has nearly half the casino floor space of
Atlantic City. <A HREF="http://www.vegas.com/hotels/samstown/tunica/">Sam's Town</A>, the biggest casino, boasts eight restaurants, five
bars, an ice-cream parlor, and the "area's largest western retail store," and
it will soon have an eighteen-hole golf course, shared with the Hollywood
casino. <p>

The new casinos have enough money behind them to reach beyond Memphis and tap
into the huge Atlanta market. They offer gamblers a $99 round-trip airfare from
Atlanta to Memphis and a shuttle bus from there to Tunica. High rollers get
free flights all the way to the tiny Twinkletown Airport, just north of the
casinos. Such efforts have paid off: the casinos rake in about $60 million a
month.<p>

After Nevada and New Jersey, Mississippi makes more money from its casinos than
any other state, and Tunica's casinos are among the most lucrative in
Mississippi. Since 1992 Memphis, Tunica's main source of gamblers, has become
the fifth largest casino market in the United States. Investors have plunked
down more than a billion dollars in the county to get a piece of the action.
Property values around potential development sites have skyrocketed 9,900
percent. Two years ago Tunica had one twelve-room motel; now it has the largest
hotel in the state--in fact, the largest hotel "from Atlanta to Dallas and from
New Orleans to Opryland," as local developers like to brag. Once, Tunica's only
music venues were juke joints in back alleys and at country crossroads. Today,
on the site where the legendary blues musician <A HREF="http://www.demon.co.uk:80/london-calling/musrjohn.html">Robert Johnson</A> was born in a
sharecropper's cabin, Donna Summer plays in a 1,600-seat casino auditorium.<p>

Tunica's promoters are pushing for the kind of development that will make the
county what they call a "destination." They dream of theme parks and outlet
malls, and point to the sudden rise of the country-music mecca Branson,
Missouri, as an example of how a resort can flourish in an unlikely locale if
developers provide enough attractions. By far the grandest project in the
offing is Diamond Lakes, a proposed resort that includes 4,200 hotel rooms, a
forty- to seventy-acre theme park, a 700-slip RV park, two manmade lakes, four
theaters, and two eighteen-hole golf courses, for which about $75 million has
so far been invested.<p>

In some ways Tunica has hit the jackpot. Observing the astonishing success of
the first casinos, the county, which gets four percent of casino revenues,
hoped eventually to see an increase in its budget from $2.8 million to $7
million. In fact by 1995 the county budget had shot up tenfold, to $28 million.
Tunica's poor black population has also benefited from the casinos. Since
gambling was legalized, the percentage of county residents receiving food
stamps has fallen from more than 50 percent to 37 percent, and the county's
collection of child-support payments has jumped from under $40,000 to between
$60,000 and $70,000 a month. <p>

Nevertheless, the casinos have not rescued Tunica's poor. Although with eight
casinos the county of 8,300 people now has more jobs than residents, most of
those jobs, particularly the better-paying ones, have gone to people from
outside the county. And whereas boosters claim that the casinos have
dramatically reduced unemployment, in fact the average unemployment rate for
October of 1994 through September of 1995 was 14.5 percent--only slightly lower
than the average rate of 15.1 percent for 1991, the year before the first
casino opened. Last September unemployment was 13.6 percent, about twice the
average rate in Mississippi as a whole. Only three of the state's eighty-two
counties now suffer greater unemployment than Tunica. In the face of persistent
unemployment, those who are well-off continue to insist that "there is a job
for everyone who wants one"; but their emphasis has begun to fall on the second
clause, so that an observation that once seemed to express relief and
celebration now suggests exasperation and disgust. One woman we talked to
expressed this bluntly, complaining, "You could put a factory in some people's
back yard and they still wouldn't work."<p>

Derrick Crawford, the county's director of human services, finds this view
unfair. He points out that one kind of employer cannot possibly suit every
potential employee, and that for religious reasons alone many of Tunica's
blacks would rather be unemployed than work in a casino. Still, like many
others, he ultimately lays the blame on what is most often called the "lack of
work ethic"--meaning that many Tunicans make poor employees because they
haven't been conditioned to take a job seriously. People hint that those who
are continually out of work are in that situation because they come to work
late, take unauthorized days off, or even quit on a whim. Crawford and others
see Tunica's history of unemployment as responsible for this behavior. "If
you're twenty-six or twenty-seven and never had a job," Crawford says, "nothing
has taught you how to work."<p>

In 1989 the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission, chaired by Bill
Clinton as the governor of Arkansas, issued a more sweeping statement about the
limitations that cripple the black population in Tunica and other Delta
communities: "By any objective economic, educational or social measurement, the
. . . people in the Delta region are the least prepared to participate in and
contribute to the nation's effort to succeed in the world economy." Most
Tunicans are simply unable to take advantage of the new opportunities that the
casinos have brought to their doorstep.<p>

The disparity between the way most Americans live and the way the majority of
black Tunicans live defies belief. With the exception of crack cocaine and,
now, the casinos, little of modern America has penetrated Tunica County; far
from participating in the American dream, most of Tunica's black population is
excluded from even the mundane aspects of American life. <p>

"This is a different world," Dorothy Rhea, a waitress at one of the casinos,
says, describing the sensation of coming to Tunica from Memphis. To explain
what she means, she tells a story of working with a new waitress, a young black
woman from Tunica. "She's holding out a plate of bacon," Rhea says of the other
woman, "and she keeps asking me, `Is this toast? I need toast. Is this toast?'"
The woman was not being sarcastic, Rhea explains. "She really didn't know what
toast was." <p>

But the county's problems are even more complex than its grim statistics and
such examples of isolation from America's mainstream would suggest. "Race," as
one woman told us, "is at the heart of everything here in Tunica." <p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Blatant
Separation 
</a></h3><p>

<font size=5>N</font>OT everyone is poor in what has sometimes been known as the poorest county in
America. Pointing out the big landowners, Tunicans often claim that the county
is home to more than thirty millionaires. Perhaps more important, Tunica,
unlike most rural counties in the South, has almost no poor whites. In fact, in
the county seat, the town of Tunica, which is 74 percent white, the county's
reputation for poverty is difficult to credit. The wide main street is lined
with a few basic shops--a hardware store, a drugstore, two banks--and is
refreshingly free of links from any fast-food chain. An old-fashioned brick
courthouse stands in the middle of town. Some of the houses in the most visible
neighborhood are modest, though solid and well tended, but most are
substantial, and a few might be called mansions. All sit back from the street
on large, leafy lots. <p>

To be poor in Tunica County is to be black. Most blacks live outside the town
limits--the county as a whole is 74 percent black and only 26 percent white,
the reverse of the town. Many blacks live in North Tunica, better known as the
"sub" (short for "subdivision"), an unincorporated area adjacent to the county
seat. There is some federally subsidized housing in the sub--small, neat brick
ranch houses, trailers, and an apartment complex that looks like a barracks.
And there are many houses that might more accurately be called shacks. No white
people live in North Tunica, and the town has no desire to annex it.<p>


		<img src="./cotton.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="" border=0>



The physical separation of the races in Tunica is not so surprising in itself.
After all, few places exist in America where separation does not occur. What
seems unusual to the outsider is that the two groups are so close to each
other--just across the street in many cases--and yet so unambiguously apart.
Robinsonville, the crossroads hamlet closest to the casinos, demonstrates this
pattern in miniature. A quarter-mile stretch of street is serene, lined with
gracious houses, their walls of freshly painted wood or ivy-covered brick,
skirted by green lawns and shaded under arching trees. Last Fourth of July the
driveway alongside one of them was packed with BMWs and Cherokees. A child's
voice piped occasionally from another back yard, and in front of a third house
a woman maneuvered her sit-down mower carefully around a tree.<p>

The street just around the corner was lively. Along this quarter-mile stretch
stands a featureless single-story cinder-block rectangle divided into tiny
apartments, and a handful of shacks, their porches balanced on cinder blocks,
the wood of their walls bare and weathered gray, their corrugated-tin roofs
rusted. The postage-stamp yards in front of these homes are packed dirt and
stones, and on the Fourth vans and old American luxury cars were parked in and
around them. Music was blasting, and a couple of the porches were crowded. Cars
and pickup trucks rambled down the street, paused while someone leaned in the
window for a while, and then turned around and rambled up the street again. The
two streets together make up almost the whole of Robinsonville, but they seem
to belong to completely different worlds. <p>

The blatant separation of the races in Tunica's schools shocks an outsider even
more than the county's housing pattern, and neither blacks nor whites seem to
object to this separation, which is most shocking of all. With few exceptions,
Tunica's white children attend the private, all-white Tunica Institute of
Learning. White churches reportedly raise funds to help the small number of
white families who otherwise could not pay the tuition. Tunica's black children
go to the public schools. Last year only one white student attended Rosa Fort,
the public high school. Significantly, he was not from Tunica; his family had
just moved into the county from California.<p>

Certainly Tunica has changed radically since the 1940s, when the county sheriff
accused the folklorist Alan Lomax of being a foreign spy because he violated
the county's racial code. Lomax was detained because he interviewed the blues
musician Son House, a black man, without permission from the planter for whom
House worked, because he referred to House with the honorific "Mister," and
because the sheriff suspected that Lomax had shaken House's hand. Today the
sheriff of Tunica County is black. But while Tunicans now eschew the virulent
racism of the past, the attitude that fueled the old behavior--what scholars
generally agree comes down to a fear of miscegenation--has merely been
tempered, not eradicated. The principal of Rosa Fort, Willie Dismuke, who is
black, is surprisingly offhand, for instance, when he mentions that fear of
interracial dating is at the heart of the separation between the schools. A
racial code still dictates relations between whites and blacks in Tunica,
constricting both groups. As Sister Gus Griffin, of Catholic Social Services, a
social-service organization in Tunica, observes, "I think in the social
structure of Tunica white people would be ostracized if they sent their kids to
Rosa Fort. Whites are in line too. They're not free." <p>

Race relations influence Tunica's response to its new wealth, and in this way
the county's plans for its future are the inevitable flowering of its history.
Tunica has shared that history, for the most part, with the rest of the

<b><u>"The Most Southern <BR> Place On Earth"</u></b><p>

<font size=5>I</font>N defining the boundaries of what he regarded as a distinct region, the writer
David Cohn famously remarked in 1935 that the Mississippi Delta "begins in the
lobby of the Peabody Hotel in Memphis and ends on Catfish Row in Vicksburg." In
fact the Delta begins twenty-eight miles south of the Peabody, just north of
the Tunica County border, where the hills abruptly end and Highway 61 descends
into a land that unrolls as flat as a floor to the horizon. And "the Delta" is
not really a delta but an alluvial plain 200 miles long and seventy miles wide
at its widest, across which the Yazoo and Mississippi rivers flooded and
receded for millennia, depositing their riches, until the Delta became, as Cohn
described it, "pure soil endlessly deep, dark, and sweet." It is probably the
richest soil in the world. In the 1820s, when the first planters became aware
of the Delta's agricultural potential, it was a swampy wilderness, choked with
vegetation, where panthers and water moccasins lurked--"a seething lush hell,"
as one eighteenth-century scholar described it.<p>

The historian James C. Cobb, perhaps the leading authority on the region, has
called the Mississippi Delta "the most southern place on earth." Its history is
the history of the South at its most extreme. From the start the Delta
presented an opportunity for high-stakes gambling. The soil promised quick
riches in cotton, but those who tried to win them risked cholera, malaria, and
typhoid fever, and climatic extremes ranging from drought to floods to frost.
Those whose bodies survived the diseases and whose crops survived the weather
could see the whole endeavor come to nothing in the fickle cotton market. Such
a gamble attracted wealthy landowners from the East whose plantations were
wearing out and who could afford the enormous investment in cash and slaves
necessary to clear and drain and cultivate the land. Producing a profitable
cotton crop in the Delta required physical labor above all. By 1850 the slaves
on whom the planters depended for this labor outnumbered whites in the most
developed area of the Delta by more than fourteen to one. <p>

Black men and women transformed the Delta. As Cohn explained, without the
African-American there would be no Delta as we know it today. 
<blockquote>The Negro's identification with the life of the Delta is
fundamental and complete. . . . It was he who brought order out of a primeval
wilderness, felling the trees, digging the ditches and draining the swamps. The
vast rampart on the levees upon whose existence the life of the Delta depends
sprang from the sweat and brawn of the Negro. Wherever one looks in this land,
whatever one sees that is the work of man, was erected by the toiling,
straining bodies of the blacks.</blockquote>With its grueling, year-round work,
malarial swamps, and planter class frantic to see its gamble pay off, the
Mississippi Delta was perhaps the worst place in America to be a slave. Being
"sold down the river" to the Delta quickly developed a reputation as a death
sentence. At the other extreme the members of the Delta's white elite, freely
spending their profits in dissipation and ostentation, soon became known for
their pursuit of the good life. Poor and middle-class whites had no place in
this plantation economy. "By the middle of the nineteenth century," Cobb
writes, "the Delta had already assumed an enduring identity as a region where a
wealthy, pleasure-seeking, and status-conscious white elite exploited the labor
of a large and thoroughly subjugated black majority." <p>

Long after the Civil War whites remained convinced that their success depended
on the Delta's being a place where their interests, solely because of their
race, always came first. As one Tunica County planter told a sharecropper early
in this century, "This is a place for me to make a profit, not you." <p>

However subjugated, blacks were essential in the Delta, since the cotton
plantations continued to require a large labor force. Delta whites thus had to
coexist with a group they feared but on whom they depended, and this, along
with a bedrock of racial animosity, underlay the relationship between the races
for decades. Beginning in the late 1940s, when cotton production was
mechanized, eliminating the need for most agricultural labor, this relationship
changed fundamentally. "By the end of the 1960s," Cobb maintains, "Delta blacks
[were] largely superfluous to the economic interests of Delta whites"--a
situation that largely defines race relations in the Delta today. <p>

Although mechanization spurred a huge black migration to the North--part of the
largest population movement in American history--African-Americans still make
up nearly 70 percent of the Delta's population. The paramount problem in
Tunica, from the point of view of many whites, is what to do with this group
that stayed behind--a black majority disproportionately unemployed, dependent,
and miserably educated, a population that many whites regard as dross. In fact,
the wish of some whites, one white woman from Tunica whispered to us recently,
"is for [black people] to go away," leaving Tunica for the whites. For both
political and economic reasons, this has been true since mechanization. The
black population, for its part, seems pretty well convinced that its fortunes
in Tunica will never change. This resignation gives rise to a resentful
passivity, which the white population perceives as an unwillingness or
inability on the part of blacks to improve their situation. The behavior of
each side thus confirms the worst suspicions of the other.

<font size=5>T</font>UNICA is really two communities, deeply divided by race and wealth, and the
economic boom that was at first greeted as a universal good has in many ways
exacerbated the county's division. Blacks believe that even if casino revenues
prove to be a rising tide that lifts all boats, it still won't lift them out of
their subordinate position. Some blacks fear that Tunica's new prosperity might
make their place in the county even more marginal.<p>

Whereas legalized gambling is the most recent in a series of attempts to bring
industry to the area, historically such efforts have been designed to retain
and increase the minority white population rather than to create employment for
blacks. Many of Tunica's whites, it seems, see casino gambling as a means to
transform Tunica into a white middle-class exurb of Memphis. <p>

<p>

Ken Murphree, the county administrator, talks hopefully about golf courses,
factory-outlet malls, and retirement communities to solidify Tunica's new image
as a center for recreation and leisure. His wife, Connie Murphree, points out
that Tunica's quiet rural atmosphere would make it a haven for those who want
to escape urban problems. If the casinos succeed, and the leisure industry
develops as its boosters hope, the county will attract young couples wanting to
work and retirees ready to play, and will house them in new condominiums and
planned communities. Eventually Tunica will attract middle-class families with
jobs in Memphis who want a better house on more land than they can afford in
the city, and the county, with what its promoters call a "nice little Southern
town" at its core, will prosper as a bedroom community for Memphis and a
retirement center for the mid-South. <p>

Tunica's blacks are conspicuously absent from this vision. In fact, it's
impossible to reconcile the existence of a majority population that is still
desperately poor and difficult to employ with this idea of what Tunica's
boosters would like the county to become. Already, with the rise in land
values, those who are ill equipped to take advantage of Tunica's new
opportunities are seeing their rents skyrocket while their housing remains
substandard. As Clifford Cox, the director of Tunica Habitat for Humanity,
observed over coffee last summer, "This county is so dollar-signs-in-the-eyes
that they're not looking at the small community--the citizens that are already
here. They're concentrating on how to bring people in."<p>

Tunica's transformation seems to be off to a good start. One of the county's
largest landowners has joined with developers from Memphis to build a planned
community in Robinsonville, near the casinos. But some of Tunica's blacks worry
that the closer the county's leaders come to realizing their vision, the more
marginalized the black population will become. Although an influx of families
with good incomes would seem to be a boon to the county's educational system,
for instance, Willie Dismuke, the high school principal, assumes that such
growth will ultimately result in two public schools, one for affluent white
newcomers, one for poor black Tunica natives. (Indeed, a new elementary school
to serve the anticipated population boom in the Robinsonville area is now under
consideration.) Whether or not events prove Dismuke right, his assumption that
Tunica will steadfastly remain two communities even if the county's economy and
population change radically shows a striking lack of confidence in Tunica's
ability or willingness to allow race relations to change.<p>

<a name="RTFToC5">"This
Is Our Home"<p>

</a></h3>
<font size=5>F</font>ROM the time when public schooling for Tunica's blacks meant one-room
schoolhouses on the plantations, where education was limited by the demands of
the cotton crop and stopped at eighth grade; through the period 1952-1970, when
the schoolhouses were closed and blacks and whites attended separate and
unequal elementary and high schools; through desegregation, when the white
community abruptly and en masse abandoned Tunica's public schools, the county's
educational system has epitomized its racial divide. Today the debate over how
much of Tunica's new wealth should be spent on public education brings the
county's racial division to a head.<p>

To the county board of supervisors, which is 60 percent white, investing in
Tunica means building infrastructure to support the casinos and to attract more
business. (The board has also been pleased to cut property taxes by 50 percent,
thanks to the county's new casino-generated income.) This may seem like a
reasonable course for developing the county, but it neglects the most obvious
obstacle to the economic progress of Tunica's majority. <p>

Mississippi's public schools are considered the worst in the nation, and
Tunica's school system is among the worst in Mississippi. Tunica's school
district ranked 152 out of 153 in a statewide literacy exam in 1995, and its
students have consistently tested so poorly on various achievement exams that
the Mississippi Department of Education has placed the district on probation
for seven of the past eight years. Although the casinos have tried to hire
Tunicans as often as possible, if only for the sake of good public relations,
they have found most blacks from Tunica to be unprepared for all but the most
menial positions. Illiteracy plagues the black population, and many of Tunica's
blacks lack the math skills not only to be dealers but, according to the
casinos, even to make change.<p>

Improving Tunica's abysmal public education would seem to be an obvious first
step in any effort to better the lives of its citizens and strengthen the
county's economic prospects overall, but originally the supervisors were not
going to allot any of the county's take to the public schools. And although in
many places public education unites parents of different races and economic
levels, in Tunica the coalition of community activists and teachers that hired
a lawyer to get the county to allocate casino revenues to the schools was
entirely black.<p>

In response to the black community's continuing demands that the county devote
more money to education, many in the white community maintain that the schools'
problems do not stem from a lack of funds. They suggest that the Tunica school
district has for years spent more per pupil than the average Mississippi school
district. In 1986, however, Tunica ranked 142 out of 154 in per-pupil spending.
Today, largely thanks to state and federal money, Tunica does indeed spend more
than the Mississippi average on its pupils, but to argue that the amount is
adequate seems somewhat disingenuous, since far more than average expenditure
would be required to offset the extreme disadvantages under which Tunica's
black students labor. Certainly whites in Tunica need not have bad intentions
to believe that the windfall from the casinos is better spent on
infrastructure, but their motives are automatically suspect whenever a decision
involves the public schools, because they long ago forsook that institution. It
is no doubt galling to many blacks in Tunica that whites make choices about
schools they didn't attend and to which they don't send their children, and
equally galling to many whites that they must help support schools they don't
use. <p>

Perhaps most frustrating for the black population is that Tunica does not seem
eager to make a place for even those blacks who have been able to take
advantage of the new opportunities the casinos have presented to improve their
lives. Some black Tunicans have managed to earn enough money working in the
casinos to get themselves off welfare. Now they would like to buy houses in the
community where their families have lived for generations. Whereas it would
seem that these are just the sort of citizens that Tunica might like to keep,
the county is in fact offering them little reward for their efforts. Few
low-cost, decent houses are available in Tunica, and there seems to be some
effort to keep things that way. Perceiving a new market, Bob Hall, a local
developer, is trying to build houses that those blacks who are now steadily
employed can afford with a Federal Housing Administration loan, and he blames
the town's planning commission for trying to stall him. According to Hall, who
is white, people argue that they don't want "that kind of housing," which he
translates to mean that they don't want "any more houses for black people to
live in."<p>

Although Sister Gus Griffin concedes that the white community has become more
willing than it was in the past to permit changes that will help the black
population, she nevertheless believes that whites on the whole are unlikely "to
do anything to make it easier for African-Americans to live in Tunica."
Surprisingly, however, given this atmosphere, even those blacks who now have
the means to leave Tunica want to stay. A love for the place is one of the few
things blacks and whites share in Tunica. Reflecting the views of many in the
black community, Freddie Brandon, a board member of a Tunica housing-assistance
organization, asserted during a conversation last fall, "This is our home;
we're not going anywhere." <p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC6">A
White Exurb?
</a></h3><p>

<font size=5>I</font>T remains to be seen whether Tunica's gamble on casinos will pay off in the
long run. County officials and the Chamber of Commerce eye neighboring states
and counties nervously, fearing that if Memphis, for instance, decides to throw
its doors open to casinos, a substantial number of Tunica's gamblers will drift
away. The next year, according to developers and local officials, is crucial:
if no competing market emerges in that time, Tunica will be so well established
as a gaming mecca that future competition will pose little threat. If all goes
well, by early 1997 the county will have consolidated its position, reassuring
still more developers that Tunica is a safe investment and encouraging them to
sink their money into the rich Delta soil.<p>

Whatever their future, the casinos are booming in Tunica now, and although,
located seven miles from the county seat, they have not yet penetrated Tunica's
core, they are certainly edging the county into modern America. Dinner out in
Tunica used to mean fried catfish or chitterlings at the Blue and White, which
caters mostly to whites, or Vada's Diner, which caters mostly to blacks. Now a
Tunican need only drive to the Circus Circus casino to order cioppino and
tiramisu. More important, the casinos are happy to take everybody's money. "We
love to go out to eat out there," Sister Gus says, "to see people of both races
sitting down in the same room." As employers, too, the casinos are potentially
a progressive force that could push Tunica out of its well-worn groove. They
are a source of wealth and opportunity beyond the control of the traditional
economic and political powers in the county. And with no interest in anything
but turning a profit, they have no stake in maintaining Tunica's caste system.
<p>

If the casinos succeed in jarring the county out of decades of economic and
social stagnation, Tunica will have an opportunity far more profound than
anyone could have imagined just three years ago: it will have the means to
remake itself. If it so chooses, Tunica can use its new resources to prepare
its people to take advantage of the chance afforded by the casinos. The county
can define its needs as the needs of the majority of its citizens. But if it is
true, as one longtime white Tunica resident asserts, echoing an oft-repeated
observation, that whites "want things to stay the same; they don't want blacks
to get ahead," it is unlikely, to say the least, that Tunica will make this
choice. Even if there are many exceptions to this dismal assessment, focusing
on changing the lives of the county's poor would mean sacrificing the strides
the county could make were it not hampered by this population--sacrificing, in
other words, the vision of Tunica as a prosperous white exurb. <p>

To arrive at a thriving exurb of golf courses and retirement condos, those who
would re-create the county must essentially see Tunica as a blank canvas. Then
they can decide how best to work with the medium they have been given--the
casinos--to bring the place (although not necessarily its population) to its
fullest potential. Ironically, the economic tide that should be bringing black
Tunicans into the mainstream may instead allow white Tunica to push them even
further into the backwater, while white Tunicans chase their dream of a
prosperous rural southern town--essentially what the town of Tunica would be
today if the black areas at its edges could be ignored.<p>

As prosperous people move into Tunica, for instance, they will dilute the force
of poverty there by making what is now a poor black majority--with potential,
if not actual, political power--an underclass minority. This population will
decrease not only in relative size but also in absolute number, as those who
cannot take advantage of the new economic opportunities are displaced by the
rising rents that accompany prosperity. So although the casinos help to
alleviate the county's poverty, they are also a means by which the middle class
can distance itself from the poor in Tunica, as it has in much of the rest of
the United States.<p>

If rising costs pressure the black poor and they find Tunica uncomfortable,
they can always go to Memphis, as some whites have suggested in exasperation.
Such a "solution" is hardly original. In moving out, Tunica's blacks would,
from the point of view of the white community, be following the pattern of
black migration that occurred earlier in this century, leaving the county
because they are not economically useful there. Moreover, Memphis has an inner
city populated by impoverished blacks, so white Tunicans fall in line with the
rest of the country when they identify the ghetto as the place where poor
blacks belong.<p>

"Solving" problems by turning one's back on them has long been the American
way. It is in some sense the flip side of pursuing opportunity. This attitude
brought much of America's population here in the first place. It was also the
way of those who abandoned their worn-out, useless land and settled the Delta.
It is often a way to better oneself, to get ahead, but it becomes a different
matter when those who are turning their backs equate the problem they are
escaping with people. It is one thing to abandon land when it has outlived its
economic usefulness, and another to abandon a population.<p>

Because the county has maintained such a distance between the races, white
Tunica can disassociate itself from the county's problems by equating them with
the black population--much the way whites in Los Angeles, say, view their
city's impoverished minorities as a foreign presence imposed on the place,
depressing its economy and culture. Such an attitude, ungenerous everywhere, is
especially misguided in Tunica, where blacks have been a majority since the
Delta was settled. In fact, if either group can claim more credit for making
the Delta prosper, it is the African-Americans. If they belong anywhere, they
belong in a place that they built, sharing in its prosperity. <p>

Those who believe and can behave as if the fates of blacks and whites in Tunica
are not bound together are fooling themselves. In explaining how the white
southerner is defined by the African-American, despite the separation of the
races, William Styron has written, "In the South [the African-American] is a
perpetual and immutable part of history itself, a piece of the vast fabric so
integral and necessary that without him the fabric dissolves." Much as they
might wish and work to do so, it is more than a century too late for whites and
blacks in the Delta, "the most southern place on earth," to divorce themselves
from one another without losing an integral part of themselves.

CONOMISTS are hardly renowned for their ability to predict the economic

future. In 1929 Irving Fisher, perhaps the greatest of all American economists,

confidently predicted that the stock market would go on to new highs and that

the expansion of economic prosperity would continue, with no end in sight. Less

than two months later came the crash; the economy had already entered what was

to become the Great Depression. Published in 1987, Ravi Batra's best-selling

<i>The Great Depression of 1990</i> predicted just what the title says. So much

for predictive accuracy.<p>

Compounding the problem of prediction is the tendency to believe that each

business-cycle boom will last forever -- that the business cycle is dead.

Predictions of when the next recession will occur aside, however, there are now

solid grounds for believing that the economy is again vulnerable to the sort of

seismic shock that generated the Great Depression. The period from 1950 to 1970

is often referred to as the Golden Age of American capitalism. Real per capita

income grew in those years at 2.25 percent a year, and prosperity was

democratized as huge numbers of Americans entered the middle class. Indeed, a

new working-middle class was created, as blue-collar workers came to enjoy the

benefits of homeownership, and rising wages allowed them to buy household

appliances and new cars and to take vacations.<p>



Since 1970 this expansion and diffusion of prosperity has stopped, and the

Golden Age has been replaced by a Leaden Age, in which economic growth has been

accompanied by falling wages and rising unemployment. Real (in terms of

purchasing power) average weekly wages peaked in 1973, at $308.03 (1982

dollars), and by 1991 had fallen to $260.37, a decline of 15.5 percent. Yet the

productivity of American workers increased by 11 percent over the same period.

From 1951 to 1974 unemployment averaged 4.65 percent; from 1975 to 1993 it

averaged 6.97 percent. <p>



This waning of prosperity reflects a shift from the Main Street capitalism of

the Golden Age to the Mean Street capitalism of the Leaden Age. The hallmark of

the former was that it generally worked for the benefit of the average citizen

by sharing the fruits of growth among all. The hallmark of the latter is an

economic environment that pits citizen against citizen for the benefit of those

who own most of America. This shift is the direct result of a refashioning of

the nation's economic architecture and a reversal of the policies associated

with the Golden Age. It has opened the possibility of another Great

Depression.<p>



Since the Second World War the U.S. economy has had nine recessions, defined as

two consecutive quarters of declining output. The normal pattern has involved

an increase in the rate of unemployment and also "disinflation" -- a decrease in

the rate of inflation. The most severe of these recessions was that of

1981-1982, when unemployment exceeded 10 percent for the first time since the

1930s. The most recent recession, which began in 1990, appears to be

qualitatively different from preceding recessions in that the subsequent

recovery has been much milder, and the process of disinflation has continued

throughout the recovery period. Thus, rather than picking up, inflation has

continued to fall during the recovery, and we now have close to zero inflation.

This means that were the U.S. economy to enter a new recession, it would be

likely to experience deflation: prices and wages would actually fall. Were this

to happen, the burden of interest payments on the debts of consumers and

businesses would increase enormously, thereby making for a collapse of both

consumer spending and capital spending by businesses. <p>



It is for this reason that deflation has historically been associated with

periods of economic depression. A reasonable definition of depression is a

period of prolonged unemployment in excess of 10 percent accompanied by

deflation. The recession of 1981-1982 showed that rates of unemployment in

excess of 10 percent are again possible, whereas the most recent recession has

raised the specter of deflation. The twin characteristics of depressions are

therefore now potentially in place. Behind this new circumstance lie the

changed conditions associated with the emergence of the Mean Street economy.

The high level of indebtedness in the U.S. economy implies that if prices and

wages start falling, spending and fresh borrowing will most likely collapse,

and bankruptcies will rocket. The economy could then find itself in a

contractionary spiral, with wage deflation feeding a collapse in spending, and

collapsing spending feeding further wage deflation.<br><br><br>

<B><font size=4>Prolonged Recessions, 

<br>Tenuous Recoveries</font></B>



</CENTER>



<p>



<font size=5>O</font>NE indication of our growing economic fragility is the 

recession of 1990.  The accepted story is that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait 

and the ensuing spike in oil prices gave a sudden shock to the confidence 

of American consumers, damping their spending and pushing the economy into 

recession.  This recessionary shock was amplified by the large debts that 

American households and corporations had built up during the 1980s.<p>

 

Whereas the role of debt in propagating the recession was real and important,

the consumer-shock story resembles the snowball theory of avalanches. Moreover,

it illustrates the complete confusion that characterizes modern economics. On

the one hand, consumers are told to spend, spend, spend! On the other, they are

told to save, save, save! Similarly, whereas huge consumer debt burdens are an

important component of the new economic fragility, their existence is explained

by developments associated with the shift to the Mean Street economy. Debt,

therefore, is both a symptom and a cause of our troubles. <p>



Just as the causes of the 1990 recession have been poorly explained, so have

its prolonged nature and the weakness of the subsequent recovery. Economists

consider the recession to have ended in the first quarter of 1991, but

substantive recovery did not really begin until the second half of 1993. Thus

for almost three years the economy was effectively dead in the water. This kind

of prolonged stagnation distinguishes the current recovery from previous

postwar economic cycles. Moreover, the economic recovery has been extremely

anemic by postwar standards. In the fifty months after the trough of the

recession, in late 1990, the economy created 7.8 million jobs. That is 40

percent below the average rate of employment growth in the first fifty months

of the previous two economic recoveries.<p>



Throughout this period of putative recovery consumer confidence has been

notably weak. Income data for 1994 show that real median wages fell by more

than two percent. Thus the median household actually suffered a decline in its

standard of living. Not only has income been falling, but job security has

declined as corporate downsizing continues. The threat that production will be

relocated to low-wage regions, both within and outside the United States, is a

persistent and growing source of wage restraint.<br><br><br>





<CENTER>



<B><font size=4>The Fragile Household </font></B>



</CENTER><p>





<font size=5>F</font>OREMOST among the causes of the prolonged 1990 

recession and its subsequent weak recovery is an underlying deterioration 

in the robustness of the demand for goods and services.<p>

 

The silent depression (the erosion of wages and the increase in unemployment

rates) afflicting ordinary American households has weakened consumer purchasing

power and shifted income away from wages and toward profits and executive

salaries. This, more than anything else, has created a structural weakness in

demand. This development has been obscured, and its impact delayed, by the

tremendous growth of household debt that began in the 1980s. <p>



Expansion of household debt has always been an important source of demand

growth in the U.S. economy, paving the way for expansion of the mass market. In

past decades, however, household borrowing rested on a presumption of rising

incomes to pay it back, and was therefore "demand-leading." Today, with wages

declining, debt is being incurred simply to maintain existing living standards.

"Demand-leading" debt has become "demand-maintaining." Because new borrowing

causes a cumulative growth in household indebtedness and raises the interest

payments debtor households must make, indirectly, to creditor households, the

demand-maintaining capacity of new borrowing is unsustainable. In general, low-

and middle-income households are net debtors, while high-income households (of

which there are few) are net creditors. Consequently, demand-maintaining

borrowing aggravates the underlying problems of weak demand and unequal income

distribution.<p>



Ultimately households hit their debt ceilings. This can be temporarily

delayed -- either by raising debt ceilings and allowing households to pile up

more debt or by lowering credit requirements and lending to less-creditworthy

households. The flood of invitations to obtain credit cards and the raising of

mortgage-lending ceilings from the old "three times gross income" to "four

times gross income" show that this has in fact been happening. Again, the delay

is only temporary, because households may voluntarily stop borrowing when they

realize their financial vulnerability. The unsustainable growth of debt, rather

than the invasion of Iraq, is the likely explanation of the onset of the 1990

recession -- and it also threatens to end the current recovery. <p>



Once households run out of income to service existing debt, and borrowing

stops, maintaining demand becomes difficult. Flagging demand for goods and

services causes businesses to reduce output and lay off workers. This lowers

wage income and further undermines households' willingness and ability to

borrow, thereby worsening the underlying problem of demand. <p>



These problems would be bad enough in an economy with strong labor unions and

low unemployment, but they are likely to be worsened in an economy in which

labor is weak and companies not only lay off workers but also force wage

concessions from those not laid off. Widespread wage concessions could weaken

demand to the point where mass layoffs occur. Such a possibility now haunts the

U.S. economy, and that is why the next recession may turn into a depression.<br><br><br>

<font size=5>J</font>UST as household borrowing can sustain the economy, 

so, too, can borrowing by the federal government.  During the 1980s the 

federal government ran up huge deficits that were financed by borrowing to 

fund government spending and employment, both of which contributed 

significantly to demand.  A large component of this spending was the 

defense buildup -- a classic example of military Keynesianism (by no means 

the best sort of Keynesianism!)  at work.  The impact of this spending was 

augmented by large tax cuts for the wealthiest households in the country.  

A better policy would have been to give the tax cuts to ordinary 

households, which spend a greater share of their income.  Issues of equity 

aside, we would have achieved the same level of demand with smaller 

deficits.<p>



This period of maintaining demand through federal deficit spending is ending,

and the household sector and the government sector may thus be forced into

cutting spending at the same time. The pressure to cut government spending is

largely political, and derives from a misunderstanding of the economics of

government deficits. Though deficits can be extreme and dangerous, at less than

three percent of U.S. national income our deficit is neither. Just as

individual households borrow to finance homes and cars, we should expect

government to borrow to finance highways, sewers, schools, airports, public

buildings, and the like (the good sort of Keynesianism).<p>



Moreover, the government plays a critical role in providing the financial

sector with safe liquid assets to hold as part of its portfolios. In a growing

economy with a growing financial system, we should expect government to

borrow -- both to fund its expenditures and to lubricate the financial system.<p>



What the level of the deficit should be is impossible to say.  Though it 

was certainly too high during the Reagan era, we have now moved to the 

opposite extreme of deficit phobia.  This phobia is being opportunistically 

exploited in order to refashion government so as to lessen the protections 

it gives to ordinary workers.  This shift in policy is making workers more 

vulnerable to the discipline of the market -- sharpening competition among 

workers for scarce jobs -- and increasing the power of business over labor.  

This is the result of such developments as the declining value of the 

minimum wage, the declining value of <A 

HREF="http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/socdemo/www/whatAFDC.html">Aid to 

Families with Dependent Children</A> payments, and suggestions for limiting 

need-based claims on welfare.  The rhetoric accompanying this retrenchment 

is that of ending "dependency," yet to end dependency in any real way 

demands the creation of "opportunity." This requires running the economy at 

high levels of employment, ensuring that jobs carry a living wage, funding 

education and job training, and increasing the earned-income tax credit to 

strengthen the incentive to work.  This is not the direction of policy now.  

If one were to design a system not to end dependency but to increase 

economic insecurity the better to raise profits for employers, one would 

design today's economy.  <p>



The proposed balanced-budget amendment, requiring zero deficits, threatens to

lock the federal government into dangerously destabilizing financial practices.

In recessions, when tax revenues fall with falling economic activity, the

government would have to either cut spending or increase income taxes to

balance its budget. Either course would reduce total spending and aggravate the

recession.<p>



With or without a balanced-budget amendment, we appear to be following a

political trajectory (sanctioned by Republicans and Democrats alike) intended

to diminish greatly the economic role of government. This diminution threatens

the economic stabilizers of the Golden Age, which ensure that the government

automatically supports demand when the economy begins to trail off into

recession. These stabilizers work through the progressive income tax and the

national system of income supports. The current Republican policy proposals

threaten in varying degrees to end the federal government's capacity to act as

an automatic stabilizer by subcontracting its functions to the states, by

reducing income-tax progressivity, and by having government "wither on the

vine." <p>



Attempts to reform welfare by subcontracting the functions of the federal

government to state governments threaten this important component of the system

of automatic stabilizers. Whereas the federal government funded welfare

programs on the basis of defined standards that were independent of the number

of claimants, the proposed new arrangements will simply involve block grants to

the states, which would not be required to respond to cyclical fluctuations in

need. Under block grants the federal government would no longer automatically

pump more welfare spending into the economy during recessions, which is when

need goes up and demand must be stabilized.<p>



These shifts to contractionary fiscal practices are occurring when the

composition of federal outlays has itself become more contractionary. The

enormous increase in the national debt arising from Reagan-era deficits has

caused a leap in interest payments -- now 14 percent of federal outlays. Since

the debt is held primarily by the very wealthiest households, these payments

amount to a "reverse Robin Hood" transfer program. The net effect is

contractionary because the wealthy spend less of their income than do ordinary

Americans. <p>



When <A 

HREF="http://www1.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/presidents/html/rr40.html">Ronald 

Reagan</A> entered office, the national debt stood at just under $1 

trillion.  When <A 

HREF="http://www2.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/presidents/html/gb41.html">George 

Bush</A> left office, it stood at $4 trillion.  It is hard to see what we 

got in return.  The Reagan-Bush deficits have an almost Machiavellian 

quality to them: unable to persuade the American public to abandon its 

commitment to the New Deal system of welfare, unemployment insurance, and 

<A HREF="http://www.ssa.gov/">Social Security,</A> Presidents Reagan and 

Bush ran up huge debts that have financially boxed in government, thereby 

threatening these programs with insolvency.  Moreover, since the benefits 

received and taxes paid by ordinary Americans have remained largely 

unchanged, this increase in debt has served to give the government an 

appearance of profligacy.  Thus public opinion has turned against 

government, so that we are now willing to contemplate dismantling the 

system of automatic economic stabilizers such as the progressive income 

tax, unemployment insurance, <A 

HREF="http://www.medicaid.com/medmed.html">Medicaid,</A> and 

welfare.<br><br><br>





<CENTER>



<B><font size=4>The Deflationary Fed</font></B>



</CENTER><p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE other great instrument of economic stabilization 

has been monetary policy, which uses the Federal Reserve's control over 

interest rates to adjust the money supply and the availability of credit.  

In the past the Fed used this power to ensure high levels of employment.  

Today it is exclusively committed to achieving zero inflation and has been 

willing to accept whatever levels of unemployment are necessary to that 

end.<p>



As a result interest rates and unemployment have been much higher in the 

1980s and 1990s than they were in the period 1950-1970.  The true 

unemployment resulting from this crusade against inflation far exceeds the 

official unemployment rate, a point eloquently documented recently by <A 

HREF="http://web.mit.edu/sloan/www/StudFacStaff/Faculty/bios/thurow">Lester 

Thurow</A> in <A HREF="http://epn.org/prospect.html"><i>The American 

Prospect</i>.</A> At the beginning of this year almost eight million people 

were unemployed, yielding an unemployment rate of 5.6 percent.  But an 

additional five million discouraged workers are not actively seeking work, 

because of the lack of job opportunities.  There are also 4.5 million 

workers working part-time involuntarily.  When all these workers are 

accounted for, the true rate of unemployment is closer to 14 percent.  <p>



Inevitably, unemployment and underemployment have weakened the position of

labor and contributed to the shift in income distribution from wages to

profits. Moreover, the Fed now interprets any sign of wage increases as

incipient inflation, and responds by raising interest rates. Since wage

increases are the means by which labor shares in productivity growth, this

policy is tantamount to helping corporate and financial capital to gang up on

labor. <p>



The Federal Reserve vividly illustrated its new stance in 1994, when it raised

interest rates six times. Just as the long-awaited economic recovery was

picking up steam, the Fed slowed employment growth. It claimed that its action

was necessary to prevent inflation from accelerating, but never produced

compelling evidence of the danger of inflation. Defenders of the Fed say that

it will always be criticized for taking away the punch bowl just when the

economic party is warming up. However, the real problem is that most working

Americans haven't been invited to the party. <p>



The Federal Reserve is constantly trying to persuade itself that inflation is

accelerating in order to justify its predisposition to raise rates. This is a

dangerous game: given the fragility of the current economy, a rate increase

could halt the recovery and send the economy into a tailspin. It is not clear

that reversing interest rates could then straighten the economy out again. This

is surely the lesson of the last recession, which required three years' worth

of interest-rate cuts to produce a meaningful recovery.<p>



The Fed has been lucky so far to escape the consequences of its policies. The

wave of mortgage refinancings and household-loan consolidations that took place

in the late 1980s and the early 1990s reduced the amount of debt service that

households had to pay and thus helped to stave off a deeper recession. However,

such refinancing is ultimately limited by the amount of other debt taken on

when interest rates were at their peak and by the number of

mortgages -- gradually this stock has been exhausted. And because of the shift to

variable-rate mortgages, the refinancing of which is not worthwhile (except to

lock in rates), refinancing is not likely to provide such stimulation again.

Consequently, demand will be more fragile in the next recession, and recovery

harder to achieve.<p>



There are other barriers to refinancing and low rates. During the last

recession housing prices fell, and many homeowners in the Northeast and

California saw their equity eroded. Banks won't refinance without equity, and

if housing prices fall in the next recession, this problem will be compounded.

At the same time, banks have been lowering credit standards, increasing the

risk of default. This risk is reflected in market rates, which means that there

are limits to how low the Fed will be able to push rates in the event of

another recession.<br><br><br>





<CENTER>



<B><font size=4>Demographics and <br>Depression</font></B>



</CENTER><p>



<font size=5>T</font>HE aging of the Baby Boom generation and the 

generalized graying of America also increase the likelihood of an economic 

depression.  Household expenditure patterns have a life cycle, with people 

tending to borrow and spend more when they are young.  In middle age, after 

child-rearing is over, people begin to save more, in order to pay off their 

debts and to provide for old age.<p>

 

The size of the Baby Boom, and the fact that Baby Boomers delayed starting

families, have made these life-cycle forces work in the economy's favor for the

past twenty years. They help to explain the enormous increase in household

borrowing that occurred in the 1980s, and have served to mitigate the adverse

consequences of the polarization of income distribution. Now the inexorable

force of demographics is turning against the economy, and it is unlikely to be

offset by the influx of young immigrants, who tend to enter on the bottom rung

of the economic ladder, with low incomes, poor job prospects, and little access

to credit. Their net contribution to demand will not compensate for the aging

of middle-class America.<p>



Finally, this demographic reversal is compounded by the system for financing

Social Security. Contributions to Social Security are economically equivalent

to a tax. Right now payments into Social Security vastly exceed payments out,

because large numbers of Baby Boomers are still working. This situation will

continue through the first decade of the twenty-first century, so that Social

Security contributions will be a net contractionary drain on the economy. In

recent years this contractionary effect has been offset by federal spending.

Current moves to balance the federal budget mean that the contractionary effect

will be increasingly felt.<br><br><br>

<font size=5>P</font>ERHAPS the single most important factor in the growing 

fragility of the economy is developments in labor markets.  Deriving from 

both structural change within the economy and adverse economic policy, 

these developments have caused declining wages and widespread job 

insecurity.  Capital mobility has increased, enabling firms to freeze wages 

and benefits or to obtain outright concessions under the threat of 

relocation to low-wage regions.  Lower transportation costs, improved 

electronic communications and long-distance management technologies, and 

the deskilling of jobs through technology have all made it easier to shift 

operations to low-wage regions, even if the labor in those regions is 

unskilled.<p>



Worsening the wage squeeze is a free-trade policy that has lowered tariffs.  

Tariffs reduce the incentive to produce overseas, and tariff reductions 

increase the profitability of expatriate production, thus exacerbating the 

threat to wages and jobs posed by firms' enhanced ability to move.  The 

temporary job gains resulting from exports of machinery and equipment for 

new factories overseas have been more than offset by the job losses that 

have followed when production has moved and factories here have closed.  

Moreover, this trend toward actual or threatened expatriate production 

shows no sign of abating.  <A 

HREF="http://ffas.usda.gov/fasresources/ag-trade-policy/nafta.html">The 

North American Free Trade Agreement</A> and the <A 

HREF="http://www-lib.iupui.edu/ecollects/gatt.html">General Agreement on 

Tariffs and Trade</A> both lowered tariffs and are likely to increase the 

pressure on the wages of most Americans.<p>



Also contributing to the pressure on wages has been the decline in trade-union

power. Union membership has fallen from approximately 35 percent of the work

force in 1954 to 14 percent in 1994. Unionization among private-sector workers

is a mere 11 percent. In part this decline reflects the declining size of those

industries in which unions historically were strongest. But it also reflects

the antagonism that many American nonunion workers feel toward unions, which

have come to be viewed as just another special interest, without any particular

moral standing.<p>



This change in popular perception has been disastrous for both union and 

nonunion workers.  Unions depend for their long-term survival on popular 

support, and as that support has waned, they have become increasingly 

vulnerable to decertification drives by management and to replacement by 

nonunion workers.  But the existence of strong unions confers benefits on 

nonunion workers, since companies are willing to pay higher wages and 

provide more benefits to prevent the spread of unionization.  The decline 

of unions has been accelerated by the politically driven turn in policy at 

the <A HREF="http://www.epfnet.org/epf/nlrb.htm">National Labor Relations 

Board</A> which occurred in the 1980s -- most forcefully exemplified by the 

Reagan Administration's crushing of the air-traffic controllers' strike.  

This has made the creation of unions more difficult, union decertification 

and the replacement of striking union workers less difficult.  <p>



Taken together, these changes have significantly weakened the position of

American workers relative to companies. This trend shows no sign of abating.

The structural changes in labor markets make it more likely that wage levels

will crumble in a severe economic downturn. <p>



Businesses are increasingly willing to subcontract work and to use poorly paid

temporary workers (who are in fact semi-permanent). The availability of large

numbers of unemployed workers means that wage concessions will be relatively

easy to obtain in a downturn. In this regard the deep recession of 1981-1982

was a significant harbinger. It marked the first time since the Second World

War that wage concessions and givebacks were widespread. Beyond a certain point

the position of labor in the economy cannot get weaker without grave

macroeconomic consequences. Household debt burdens could become intolerable,

consumer spending could collapse, financial markets could be confronted by a

wave of defaults, and economic activity would plummet. It is hard to see how

policy could turn such a situation around.<br><br><br>

<B><font size=4>The Internationalization of <br>Deflationary Policy</font></B>



</CENTER><p>



<font size=5>C</font>HANGES in the international economy and the push for 

global free trade also make a depression more likely.  Economists assert 

that free trade is good for American workers, and they have persistently 

advocated the elimination of tariffs.  But they draw no distinction 

between, say, trade with West Germany and trade with Indonesia.<p>



Without doubt international trade promotes product choice and lowers prices

through international competition. However, when trade rests exclusively on

wage differentials, as does most trade with the Third World, it implicitly

becomes an instrument for pushing down wages and pushing up profits. Free trade

promotes competition not only between individual products but also between

different economic systems. Thus it can become a force for implementing the

lowest standards in workplace safety, environmental protection, and

social-welfare legislation, since business in advanced countries will push to

eliminate these costs in order to remain internationally competitive. <p>



In this fashion ill-considered free trade can promote a "race to the bottom"

that lowers wages, job security, and social-welfare standards. This possibility

has become all the more real with the tremendous increase in the ability of

business to organize production in a global way, most often in underdeveloped

countries. The greater mobility of capital, and improved global communication

and transportation systems, will make the race to the bottom a much more severe

problem in the future. <p>



This prospect is clearly evident from the emerging data on the effects of

NAFTA. The early numbers are in, and they are not good. The U.S. merchandise

trade surplus with Mexico reached a peak of $5.4 billion in 1992, the last year

before NAFTA was approved. By 1994 it had fallen to $1.3 billion, and by the

end of 1995 it had become a deficit of $15.4 billion. This marks a three-year

deterioration of $20.8 billion. Supporters of NAFTA claimed that every billion

dollars of exports would generate 19,000 jobs. If that's true, NAFTA has

already cost the U.S. economy 395,200 jobs, almost all of which were in the

relatively well-paying manufacturing sector. This cost is separate from the

depressing effect that Mexican daily wages of $6.00 have had on American wages.

The export of jobs will continue as companies such as Ford, Mattel, Zenith, and

General Electric shift production south of the border. <p>



Changes in international financial markets have also promoted a deflationary

bias. The introduction of new electronic technologies has increasingly

interlinked financial markets. Thus holders of wealth now have portfolios

containing financial assets from around the world. In its perpetual search for

the highest rates of return, financial capital moves rapidly between countries

in response to small differences in interest rates. This development has been

encouraged by economic policies abolishing controls on the international

movement of capital. Financial globalization has accelerated; as a result many

countries have only limited control over domestic interest rates, and have thus

largely lost the power to pursue expansionary policies based on low interest

rates. Worse, there is now pressure to raise interest rates in order to guard

against the possibility of sudden outflows of funds. <p>



Pressures for deflationary bias have also been evident in dealings with 

less developed nations.  Here the key institutions are the <A 

HREF="http://info-center.ccit.arizona.edu/~amun/committees/imfintro.html">International 

Monetary Fund</A> and the <A 

HREF="http://echs.ida.org/pilot/subg5/finance/IVB.html">World Bank.</A> 

Both these institutions were founded to stimulate global economic expansion 

and development, yet getting aid from them, particularly the IMF, has 

increasingly been made contingent on the implementation of "financial 

reform" programs that involve disinflation, cutting welfare and government 

spending, deregulation, and the abolition of capital controls.  This list 

of reforms effectively serves to lock a country's domestic economic policy 

into a contractionary stance rather than promoting adjustments that 

encourage sustainable growth.  <p>



Finally, developments in the economics profession increasingly cast a

deflationary shadow across the world's economies. This is because most

economists support policies of zero inflation achieved by high real interest

rates, fiscal austerity, balanced budgets, limited social and infrastructure

spending, free trade, and the globalization of financial markets. Since

economists act as policy advisers around the world, the economics profession

has become a de facto means for coordinating and implementing deflationary

policy on a global scale. This contrasts with the Golden Age, when the

economics profession advocated Keynesian policies of robust demand, high

employment, and low interest rates, and thereby served to foster global

expansion. <p>



The past twenty-five years have witnessed a persistent weakening of structural

conditions within the U.S. economy. This weakening has been predicated on

changes in labor markets which have undermined the position of American

workers, polarizing income distribution and increasing job insecurity. The

effects of these changes have been obscured by a debt binge by households and

government, and by favorable demographic factors. However, households now face

increasing financial constraints, government faces political constraints, and

the demographic situation is changing radically. At the same time, in the face

of increased capital mobility, wages continue to decline and job insecurity

widens. These are the grounds for believing that the next economic recession

could spiral into a depression.

<blockquote>



	<font size=5>H</font>ans Koning's article in this issue, <A

HREF="../germania/germania.htm">"Germania 

	Irredenta,"</A> about a lingering German desire for lost properties and 

	territories, offers a reminder of the constancy of German 

	preoccupations--and of why so much of the rest of the world has for so 

	long been preoccupied with those preoccupations.  <p>



The evolution of the modern German state out of a clutch of principalities 

occurred entirely within the lifetime of <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>, and

writers 

in our pages have closely followed the consequences.  The first issue 

appeared in 1857, the year Prussia's King Friedrich Wilhelm IV lost his 

mind--an event that fatefully shifted the succession (to the Kaiser Wilhelm 

I and II branch) and heralded the rise of <A 

HREF="http://cyberschool.4j.lane.edu/Classes/GlobalHistory/GlobalHistoryMaterials

/cybertexts/Bism.HTML">Bismarck</A>. 

 An <I>Atlantic</I> correspondent reported in 1861, "The unity of Germany as

one 

nation has never stood a better chance of being realized than now." The 

Reich came into being in 1871.  Within a few decades the articles became 

distinctly more ominous, with celebrations of Germany's growing scientific, 

cultural, and industrial might giving way to admonitory explorations of 

"The German Mind." A few years after Germany's defeat in the First World 

War the theologian <A

HREF="http://www.word.com/textword/habit/perry/niebuhr.html">Reinhold

Niebuhr</A> published a prophetic essay titled <A 

HREF="Niebuhr.htm">"Germany and Modern Civilization,"</A> in which he urged 

the study of Germany upon those seeking to understand contemporary 

civilization: "Nowhere will they discover the forces which contend for 

mastery in a modern state more clearly defined or the moral impotence of 

modern industrial civilization more obviously revealed."<p>



A year after German armies overran the Netherlands, in 1940, Hans Koning, 

who had been born in Amsterdam and was then aged seventeen, escaped to 

England by means of an underground network through France and neutral 

Spain. He served with the Royal Artillery and as a commando in the British 

Army in France, in the Netherlands, and in the British zone in occupied 

Germany. Later, with some years of university (Zurich, the Sorbonne) 

behind him, he worked as the editor of a weekly newspaper in Amsterdam and 

as a radio producer in Indonesia. From Indonesia he traveled on a Dutch 

freighter to the United States, where he published his first novel, <I>The 

Affair</I> (1958). He has since published about twenty books, some of them 

growing out of his work during the 1960s as a reporter for <I>The New 

Yorker</I>. Among his best-known novels are <I>A Walk With Love and Death</I> 

(1961) and <I>The Kleber Flight</I> (1981). Koning is an inveterate traveler

who 

has reported from China, Russia, Cuba, Mexico, and Egypt, and from all over 

Europe, frequently including Germany.  All his work--novels, journalism, 

and travel writing alike--is informed by political sensitivity and a strong 

moral edge.<p>

<blockquote>

	<font size=5>I</font> CLEARLY remember a newsreel of the state memorial 

	ceremony for Reinhard

Heydrich, which I saw in late 1942, when I was a very young sergeant in the

British army. (Germany exported movie news to Sweden and Switzerland, and some

got to England.) Heydrich, the German governor of 

<A HREF="http://lcweb2.loc.gov:8080/country-studies/cz_01_05.html">Bohemia and 

Moravia</a> (now the

Czech Republic), had been killed by two Czech resistance fighters that spring.

The service was in a dark hall in Berlin, lit by torches; a heathenish,

Valhalla-like effect had been achieved. In his oration Hitler screamed that if

the Czechs would not "co-exist peacefully" in the German Reich, they would at

some future date be resettled in the Polar Circle. His audience shouted its

approval. Earlier Hitler had picked the small town of Lidice, near the spot

where the Czechs attacked Heydrich's car, as the focal point for immediate

vengeance. Its adults were killed, its children shipped to camps and German

orphanages and given German names.<p>

Heydrich had not only been the ruler of Bohemia and Moravia; he had also been

given the task of organizing the extermination of the Jews of Europe. The

invitations to the <A HREF="http://h-net.msu.edu/~german/gtext/nazi/wanneng2.html">Wannsee Conference</A> of January 20, 1942, where the logistics

of the gas chamber were worked out, had been sent out by him from Prague.

"<i>Mit anschliessendem Fr&uuml;hst&uuml;ck</i>," his letters said--"With

breakfast to follow."<p>



Hitler's Polar Circle plans have, fifty-four years later, attracted unexpected

new interest. Several Sudeten Germans have sued in Czech courts for the

restitution of lands and property that were appropriated after the Sudetens

were expelled from what is now the Czech Republic, at the end of the Second

World War. The government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, which wants an apology

from the Czechs for those expulsions, announced last year through its Foreign

Minister, Klaus Kinkel, that approval of the expulsions as part of the 1945

Potsdam Declaration by the Big Three (the United States, the United Kingdom,

and the Soviet Union) did not make them legal. Kinkel sided with the Sudeten

Germans, who assert that the declaration is in conflict with the United Nations

Charter. (He uses the more circumspect phrase "in conflict with international

law.") <p>



A shiver must have gone through Germany's neighbors at this argument, which

questions the very foundation of their states. Last February the ambassadors of

the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia published a statement in

Prague reaffirming the Potsdam Declaration. But a feeling persisted that, just

maybe, we were going back to square one. <p>



As far as I could see, the U.S. media gave very little attention to this. It

made me decide to take a trip, early this year, to southern Germany.<pre>



</pre>



<font size=5>T</font>HE Second World War really started with those Sudeten Germans. Some two to

three million of them lived in "the Sudetenland,"as the Germans called a 

Czech

region along the border. In 1938 Hitler declared that the Sudetenland was

Germany's last irredenta--the last foreign territory that really belonged to

Germany--and that to get it was his "last demand" in Europe. All through the

summer he fought a war of nerves against the West, raving about the perfidious

Czechs and their "stage actor President," Eduard Benes, who were

terrorizing Germans, beating German women and children who wore white stockings

(the German "uniform") and murdering Germans in isolated villages. The circus

of provocation was orchestrated for him by the leader of the Sudeten Germans,

the Nazi Konrad Henlein. The United States was looking away at that time;

England and France caved in and forced the Czechs to cede the Sudetenland. This

was "Munich"--the shameful surrender led by the English Prime Minister, Neville

Chamberlain, in the fall of 1938. Czechoslovakia lost its fortified border with

Germany and its important armaments factories, and some six months later the

rest of the country was taken by the Germans without a shot. Hitler came to

Prague and slept in the government Hradcany Castle under the swastika

flag. "I saw our enemies at Munich," he told his followers later. "They are

little worms." 

<p>

When one rethinks this story and the terror of the six-year German occupation

that followed, in which some 350,000 Czechs lost their lives, one cannot be

surprised that after the German surrender in 1945 there were numerous acts of

local vengeance in which Sudeten Germans were killed. The bulk of those who

remained were deported by the Czech government with a minimum of

consideration--not to the Polar Circle, though, but back to their fatherland.

These Germans and their descendants now want their lands and houses back.

Meanwhile, the Czech survivors of the German concentration camps, some 17,000,

still have not received any compensation from Bonn.<p>



I learned on my visit that there is a specifically political angle to this: the

Sudeten Germans have a pressure group within Germany, the Sudetendeutsche

Landsmannschaft, with political clout that the millions of German deportees

from Poland never had. Bavaria, where most of them live, is one of the sixteen

<i>L&auml;nder </i>(states) in reunited Germany; it has a lot of autonomous

power. A 1954 act of its government established the <A HREF="http://www.qrz.com/gene/reg/SUD/sudet_en.html">Sudeten Germans</A> as one of

the four population groups that make up Bavaria (with the Swabians, the

Franconians, and the Old Bavarians) and guarantees them

<i>Schirmherrschaft</i>--"high protection"or "guardianship." This gives the

Sudetens a direct channel to the Bavarian government and through that to Bonn.

Bonn's conservatives are particularly nervous right now about being outflanked

on the right.<p>



What is happening could be nothing more than a war of words. (Indeed, in a May

speech Kinkel spoke of compensation for the Czech "victims of Nazi

injustice.") It points, though, to a basic dilemma: either united Germany is an

established country like any other, with all the egotism and arrogance of a

major power, or it is still in a kind of quarantine. Europe's politicians and

businesspeople have long accepted the first alternative, although I was often

told that Kohl himself promotes a united Europe so fervently because he does

not trust his country to be left on its own. He has called Germany's

integration into Europe "a matter of life or death" for the twenty-first

century.<p>



One of the people who stressed this point of view to me was an editor of the

<i>Stuttgarter Zeitung</i>, a serious and liberal south-German newspaper. The

day we first met he wrote in his paper, "He who tries to demand certain rights

based on the past prepares a European catastrophe." Those words were directed

at the Sudeten Germans in Bavaria. Thoughtful as they sound, they gave me the

feeling that even he still didn't "get it." <p>



It's not a matter of the Sudetens' claiming their property on the basis of past

records. It is a matter of the past's not being a source of <i>any</i> kind of

German rights. If Germany had been a victor, even for a limited time, whole

nations and many old and famous cities would have been wiped off the earth. The

best that reunited Germany can ask for, it seems to me, is a clean slate. By no

stretch of emotion or law should it expect a court to study the deportation of

the Sudetens or any other such actions outside their contexts.<p>



When my discussion with the editor turned to united Germany's border with

Poland, he called it a <i>Wohlstandsgrenze </i>--a line between poor and

well-off people. He was, perhaps unconsciously, downgrading a national border

to an affair of economic zoning. After 1945, West German maps and atlases

continued to show the 1937 borders. East Germany was usually called "Middle

Germany." The Potsdam demarcations, the maps indicated, were but "temporary."

Indeed they were--but no one in the West predicted that they would change again

to Germany's advantage. Among the many who played along with this negation of

postwar political reality was the American oil company Esso, as Exxon was then

called; when one had to drive through a checkpoint, the East German guards

confiscated Esso road maps and tore them up with great gusto. A conference of

West German education ministers ruled that in schoolbooks "the loss of German

land in the East is to be established as a loss to the entire civilized world."

<p>



When I traveled this spring from Paris to Frankfurt on an evening train, I saw

to my horror that the railroad map in the corridor showed no border at all

between Germany and Poland beyond a two-inch-long dotted line west of Szczecin.

With the first daylight I discovered that there was indeed a border marked, so

thin as to be almost invisible against the blue of the Oder River, which it

followed. I am sure that German railroad officials would say this was done

unthinkingly. The towns east of the border were shown with both their Polish

and old German names. <p>



I had a few years before traveled by train from Berlin to Warsaw in a

compartment full of what are called here <i>Heimwehtouristen</i>--"homesickness

tourists." At each stop they stood at the window and discussed what this or

that town was "really" called. A German atlas from the time between the two

world wars shows Strasbourg as a German town and omits the Polish corridor. One

might say that German cartography is always one war behind.

<pre>



</pre>

<font size=5>N</font>OTHING

in this is so very surprising. I cannot think of a single historical example of

a country's voluntarily giving up on its irredenta. That Germany is now as

strong as it was in 1914, and Russia perhaps as weak as it was in 1914, does

not make it any likelier that Germany will be the exception. The best chance

for lasting peace would be if Germany under the Nazis was a historically unique

situation.

<p>

A German historian, Fritz Fischer, in 1961 published a book about Germany's

policies during the First World War, <i>Griff nach der Weltmacht</i>. The title

translates as <i>Grab for World Power</i>,<i> </i>although "<i>Griff</i>" has a

slightly less negative color than "grab." An abridged version was published by

the New York publisher W. W. Norton under the calm title <i>Germany's Aims in

the First World War</i>. In the book Fischer showed how the Kaiser's serious,

polite, formalistic Germany was in its policies painfully close to Nazi Germany

in the next war. Naturally, the book caused an outcry in West Germany, but its

scholarship and the mass of documentation it presented left little room for

factual criticism.<p>



Fischer documented that Germany's war aim, almost until the bitter end, was the

creation of a German Mitteleuropa that would include Belgium, Holland,

Scandinavia, and, of course, Poland. In 1918 the Ukraine was added. (Analogous

to it would be Mittelafrika, a German colony stretching across Africa from

ocean to ocean.) Wartime German state documents said nonetheless that Germany

was fighting for the "liberty of the continent of Europe and its peoples";

France, weakened "forever" by a German demand for 40 billion gold francs in

reparations, would be forced to join the war against England.<p>



A report to the Imperial Chancellery showed a map of the frontier strip

isolating a rump Poland (perhaps to be ceded to Austria-Hungary), which was to

be settled by Germans from the "Old Reich"--after being "cleared" by deporting

part of its Polish population and all its Jews. A memorandum drawn up at the

instruction of Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg declared, "The German people, the

greatest colonising people of the world, . . . must be given wider frontiers

within which it can live a full life." If the word <i>Lebensraum </i>isn't

there yet, the concept certainly is.<p>



I realize that it is not politically correct to generalize about an entire

nation; still, centuries of a common history may put a stamp on a society which

makes it hard for other societies to understand. I hope I am not venturing into

an area of pseudo-science when I suggest that German aggressiveness was based

not only on an overconfidence that the country presumably no longer feels about

itself but also, paradoxically, on a lack of confidence it <i>does</i> feel.

What is one to make otherwise of a report by Gustav Krupp, the arms

manufacturer, written for the government in the fall of 1914? (The great

industrialists of Germany played a large role in defining war policies.) Krupp

wrote that German domination should continue in Belgium and extend to the north

coast of France. He explained, 

<blockquote>Here we should be lying at the very marrow of England's world power, a

position--perhaps the only one--which could bring us England's <i>lasting

friendship</i> [italics mine]. For only if we are able to hurt England badly at

any moment will she really leave us unmolested, perhaps even become our

'friend', in so far as England is capable of friendship at 

all.</blockquote><p>

The truth about nations is endlessly complicated, and political predictions

based on generalization may go awry: the recent past provides plenty of

examples. I find reason for some optimism in this. An experience I had toward

the end of my visit may illustrate what I mean. One of my conversations about

the German irredenta was with an academician whose real feelings about the

matter didn't become quite clear to me. He seemed to feel that Germany's

reunification had indeed created a "new legal context." He then started talking

about himself.<p>



This man would have been born in K&ouml;nigsberg, in East Prussia, he told me,

if his parents had not fled to the west from the approaching battles, in the

winter of 1944-1945. He was born in West Germany just after the war ended. <p>



K&ouml;nigsberg is now Kaliningrad, a town in Russia. As a naval base on the

Baltic Sea, it was for many years closed to foreigners--but no longer. Two

years ago the academician traveled there. He wandered through what he still

considered to be his home town, accompanied by a Russian student guide who

spoke German. Coming to the street where his parents had lived, he found that

their house was still standing. He looked at it for a while and then hastened

on. But his guide suggested that they go back and ring the bell and ask for a

look inside. The man balked at first, but then his curiosity got the better of

him and he agreed. <p>



They were asked in. Three families now lived in the house. When the man

explained the reason for his visit, the Russians made him sit down and brought

out tea and cakes, and eventually (of course) vodka. They were clearly poor

people, but they searched high and low for something to give him as a present.

If he warned them in advance, they told him, the next time they would receive

him in style.<p>



The academician paused here, lost in thought. Then, to my astonishment, he

ended, "And I now think that that was the best day in my entire life."

N 1925, a decade before his <i>General Theory of Employment, Interest, and 

Money</i> revolutionized thinking about economic policy, <A 

HREF="http://william-king.www.drexel.edu/top/prin/txt/Intro/Keynes.html">John 

Maynard Keynes</A> wrote an essay titled "The Economic Consequences of Mr.  

Churchill." He took the then Chancellor of the Exchequer to task for having 

brought the pound back to the gold standard too soon after the First World 

War and at too high a value.  Keynes predicted dire economic consequences.  

He was right.  The British economy stagnated, resulting in years of 

unemployment above 10 percent even before the Great Depression.  Because 

Britain was still central to world trade, its deflation spread deflation 

around the globe.<p>

Seventy years later the world economy, now led by the United States, is on a

dangerously parallel path. In the 1990s received economic wisdom has

substituted for the gold standard deficit reduction as the central instrument,

with zero inflation as the central goal, of economic policy. <p>



The effects are disturbingly similar to those of the orthodoxy of the 1920s

before Keynes's <i>General Theory </i>suggested that deliberate government

deficits could be used to stimulate employment. In recent years the richest

nations in the world have suffered increasing unemployment (and in the United

States increasing inequality) and social unease even in good times, with worse

to come when the cycle turns down.<p>



Keynes contended that <A 

HREF="http://www.empirenet.com/~rdaeley/authors/churchill.html">Churchill</A> 

had erred because "lacking .  . .  instinctive judgement, he was deafened 

by the clamorous voices of conventional finance; and, most of all, because 

he was gravely misled by his experts." The same is true of Bill Clinton.  

In his first few months as President he surrendered the traditional liberal 

Democratic stress on expanding demand, leaving conventional finance in 

possession of the field.  This not only weakened the government's ability 

to increase the demand for labor but also made impossible more than nominal 

investment in programs to improve the adaptability of job seekers to 

available jobs.  One major reason for the President's defection was that 

his own experts in the ranks of academic economists and in his 

Administration had turned to pre-<i>General Theory</i> orthodoxy.  Therein 

lies an important part of the tale that climaxed but did not end in the 

1994 Republican congressional victory and the great budget battle of 

1995-1996.  A high point was the President's acceptance, in mid-July of 

last year, of the Republican goal of a balanced budget in seven years.  By 

then the only real issue that remained was the rate of federal withdrawal 

from support of the economy and of those left behind by prosperity.  <p>



With balance as the sole criterion for budgeting, and zero inflation as the

sole objective, what used to be called full employment has been forgotten, even

though the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978 still mandates it as a central national

goal. The problem is one of long-term change, not recession. Even the <i>low

</i>unemployment rates of the good times of the 1980s and 1990s almost match

the <i>highs</i> of the 1950s and 1960s. Unemployment of six to seven percent

was severe recession then; now when unemployment dips below six percent, storm

warnings go up: too low an unemployment rate might be inflationary.<p>



At the same time, inequality of earnings and income has been increasing among

wage and salary earners and among American families. The rich have been getting

much richer, the poor significantly poorer. And the future looks bleak to the

insecure middle class, whose fearful members are tempted to blame their ills on

those who are worse off than they are. Economic stimulus is not the cure for

all these problems, but lacking stronger economic growth than we have had, no

remedy is possible.<p>



When the business cycle turns down again, and unemployment rises from its

already high lows, the political and social effects may go beyond grumbling and

petty meanness to expanding extremism in many areas of American life.<br><br><br>

<B><font size=4>Clinton's Case</font></B>



</CENTER>



<font size=5>T</font>O say that the previously Keynesian economists in the 

Clinton Administration have been captured by conservative orthodoxy is not 

to say that they are wrong.  The Keynesian models used through the 1960s 

broke down under the shock of oil-price increases in the 1970s.  

Unemployment went to levels higher than had been seen since the Depression, 

but attempts to reduce it by fiscal stimulus caused inflation to accelerate 

to rates not seen since the aftermath of the Second World War.<p>

 

When the collapse of oil prices in the early 1980s made possible a return 

to both lower unemployment and lower inflation, the Reagan Administration 

tried "supply-side" economics.  The resulting deficits were so huge that 

the Federal Reserve had to raise already high interest rates to 

unprecedented levels to avoid overstimulation of the economy.  

Supply-siders had contended that cutting tax rates would raise tax 

revenues, but <A 

HREF="../../../election/connection/Budget/stockman.htm">David 

Stockman </A> Reagan's budget director, knew better.  He later admitted 

that he had deliberately used the deficits to paralyze government social 

spending and "dismantle" federal programs put in place since 1933.  <p>



Stockman's scheme worked. The Democratic economists of the Clinton

Administration contend that although the deficits are not the fault of the

Democrats, their huge presence must nonetheless dominate the Administration's

fiscal policies. <p>











Their line of argument: <p>



<UL>



<LI> Over the past several decades the increase in U.S. productivity has slowed.

<p>



<LI> Productivity is increased primarily by increasing capital investment, but

investment has been decreasing. <p>



<LI> A major reason for the shortfall in investment is that because deficits must

be financed by borrowing, they compete with private investment for borrowable

funds, thus raising interest rates and crowding out productive investment in

<font size=5>T</font>HOSE who advocate a return to stimulus counter:<p>



<UL>



<LI> The argument that productivity

increases have slowed ordinarily compares the decades before 1972 with the

decades thereafter. Increases since then have in fact been slower than those of

the 1950s and 1960s, but once the petroleum problems of the 1970s stopped

affecting the system, productivity began to increase significantly

more rapidly.<p>



<LI> The quantity of investment is only one factor in increasing productivity, and

not the strongest one. Technological change, including organizational change,

contributes virtually twice as much, and improving worker education almost as

much. And in any case, business investment in plant and equipment, as a

percentage of GDP, has in fact been relatively high since the end of the oil

shocks. <p>



<LI> The crucial issues have to do with the crowding out of private-sector

investment and with interest rates. In the world of classical economics, in

which involuntary unemployment is by definition impossible, the total

quantities of productive resources available at any time, including borrowable

funds, are fixed. Thus any funds used by government must be taken away from

private uses, and taking them raises interest rates for those wanting to borrow

for private investment. But in the Keynesian (and the real) world, if demand is

so slack as to make most investment expenditures seem risky, low interest rates

may have little effect. Attempts to use monetary policy in such circumstances

have been likened to pushing on a string.

</UL><p>



Economists never have arrived at a satisfactory theory for weighting the

various factors that affect investment. The cost of borrowable funds is

certainly one of them, but only one. Taxation may also have important effects

on investment incentives: if the returns from investment are increased by tax

reduction, investment will increase. That is the central point of supply-side

economics. It is a good point in the abstract, but the relative weight of the

tax effect remains open to debate. <p>



Perhaps the most important determinant of investment, however (so most

economists of the 1950s and 1960s held), is the demand for products produced by

new plant and equipment. If, for example, demand for automobiles is expected to

increase, Ford or Honda may invest in a new plant. Whether Honda will do it in

Honshu or in Ohio is a question that suggests that economic policies

must increasingly be considered on the international level. Regardless, market

demand remains a crucial factor in determining investment. And fiscal policy

contributes directly to market demand. If the economy is operating at less than

full employment, then increased government spending or tax reduction or both

can increase demand for goods and services and consequently increase investment

in capital goods to make products to supply the demand. <p>



Which economic policies will best increase productivity and growth thus remains

an issue much more open than is suggested by current orthodoxy. President

Clinton, Senator Bob Dole, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and

Vice-Chairman Alice Rivlin, point in one direction: balance the budget to

reduce competition for investable funds. Some very respectable economists but

few politicians, in the United States or elsewhere, point the other way:

increase investment by increasing demand. <br><br><br>





<CENTER>



<B><font size=4>The Fallacious Family<br>Analogy</font></B>



</CENTER>



<font size=5>T</font>HE whole story, however, like all policy stories, is 

primarily one of politics, not economics.  Deficit spending has been 

considered politically dishonorable for a long time -- before, during, and 

after the Keynesian heyday.  The reason is expressed in the observation 

that elected officials enjoy the benefits of spending on voters but abhor 

the penalties of imposing taxes -- and thus the political incentives that 

encourage irresponsible deficit spending must be controlled, perhaps even 

by a balanced-budget amendment.<p>



The popular analogy is to a spendthrift family borrowing to live beyond its

means. That analogy is dubious, for three reasons. <p>



First, even thrifty families borrow for long-term purposes, many of

which -- their children's education, for example -- may be expected to increase

future income. A substantial part of federal spending is similar: it is

investment to increase future national income. Indeed, more than half of the

states' constitutions require balanced operating budgets, but they separate out

capital budgets to allow borrowing for long-term investment projects. <p>



Second, some government functions fall outside the family metaphor: if federal

deficits can have major effects on employment and other crucial economic

indicators, then national requirements for growth and stability may supersede

the simple morality of balancing income and outgo. <p>



Third, few families go broke because family members are borrowing from one

another. Most federal borrowing is from citizens or institutions that are part

of the American family; less than a quarter of our national debt is owned by

foreigners. For that reason, although deficits burden our children with debt,

debt also provides a good many of our children with such assets as government

bonds, representing the ownership of that debt. The national debt is now about

two thirds of the GDP. At the end of the Second World War it was greater than

the GDP, but postwar prosperity worked the ratio down. What threatens our

children now is not the debt, most of which they will owe to themselves.

Rather, it is economic policy aimed at achieving slow growth at best, which

will severely constrain their chances of finding good jobs. <p>



Even if the analogy between federal and family budgets is a poor one, however,

controlling spending is a valid and politically compelling goal. Advocates of

fiscal stimulus need to dissociate themselves from any idea that all spending

is good. Any proposed program that questions the current exclusive emphasis on

budget balancing must equally insist on close examination of each government

expenditure. That should include porky public works, entitlements, both

individual and corporate welfare, and "tax expenditures" -- loopholes in personal

and corporate taxes that, for bad reasons or good (for example, low-income

housing), attempt to achieve the same purposes as appropriated expenditures.

The current budget battle shows how difficult it is to do this in the face of

entrenched interests. Both the Administration and the congressional Republicans

have made brazen exceptions for special interests, even as they exchange

rhetoric over budget-balancing purity. <br><br><br>





<CENTER>



<B><font size=4>Reopen the Debate</font></B>



</CENTER>



<font size=5>I</font>N any case, the political reality is that the drive 

toward a perpetually balanced budget is not going to be reversed anytime 

soon.  Even now, however, groundwork for a new direction can be laid.<p>





<UL>





<LI> <i>The debate should be reopened</i>. Economists and political liberals

should challenge the current acceptance of deficit busting as the sine qua non

of economic policy. <p>



<LI> <i>Concepts should be re-examined</i>. Even conservative economists who put

great emphasis on budget balancing agree that the annual balancing of nominal

budget accounts (which imperfectly reflect federal spending) regardless of

economic conditions makes no sense. A recession reduces tax revenues, but

reducing expenditures to match can turn the recession into a depression. That's

what Herbert Hoover tried. Economists should suggest an alternative, such as

the <i>structurally</i> balanced budget -- one that would be balanced if the

economy were performing well. In addition, the case needs to be made vigorously

for a separate capital budget for public investment financed by borrowing. <p>



<LI> <i>The debate should be internationalized</i>. Whatever the United States

tries to do with its own economy it probably can do. The American economy is

strong, and the United States is a large enough market that the country can put

its own economic policy into effect. The same could be true of the European

Union if it were able to act as an actual union. It is still a collection of

nations, however, with the economic power in Bonn and Frankfurt. If the Germans

were willing to relax their anti-inflation constraints, West European economic

policy could still turn the continent away from the instability exemplified by

the strikes that paralyzed France in December of last year. Some French

politicians and economists are beginning to propose movement in that direction,

but France cannot reverse course without Germany. And early this year, as

French unemployment moved to almost 12 percent and German to above 10, the

president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, was giving no ground. Speaking at

a worldwide economics conference in Switzerland, he said that the bank would

not alter its monetary policy for the purpose of lowering unemployment.

Meanwhile, on the other side of Eurasia, Japan's will to pull itself up by its

economic bootstraps remains unclear. Yet coordinated stimulus in all three

centers of the First World would be far more likely to succeed than individual

national or regional efforts.





</UL>

<p>



In the American political dialogue, going beyond the parroted slogans of a

balanced budget is unlikely until the November election. It may also be

unlikely afterward, no matter what the outcome of the election. If so, the

United States can probably continue on the current economic course, at least

for a while. Yes, inequality will increase and insecurity grow. But the economy

will also grow, and if the rising tide is no longer lifting all boats, not many

are being left in the mud.<p>



Sooner or later the tide will go out. The real and deep danger is that if the

economic cycle turns toward sharp recession, and if balanced-budget

deficit-bashing remains the order of the day, either by constitutional

amendment or by rigid budgetary enactment, then we could be back in 1932. <p>



History tested then-prevalent economic theories in the 1920s and 1930s, and

those theories failed their tests. The economic imbalances and orthodoxies of

the 1920s led to the Great Depression, and that in turn opened the door to

Nazism and to war. Economic theorists and, more important, economic

decision-makers ignore such experience at great peril to the world.

	<font size=5>W</font>HEN I first called to arrange a visit to his ranch, in the high desert country

of central Oregon, Tom Campbell, a wiry man of sixty-eight, was hesitant. "I'm

like a cigarette butt," he said. "Not a hell of a lot left." Campbell's remark

was at least half in jest; several neighboring younger ranchers say they'd

think twice about tangling with this man. But it's an apt description of the

future of his territory. Once the symbol of America, the land of possibility,

today's cowboy country is sorry stuff--fenced in, bereft of water, often grazed

and trampled to dusty hardpan, challenged at almost every fence line by

environmentalists grumbling about disappearing wildlife.<p>



<A HREF="ranchidx.htm"><img src="../../../images/shorsera.gif" align=left vspace=10 hspace=10 border=0 alt="(Related Articles)">

	

	</A>

Such troubles provoke continual hand-wringing about the rancher's imminent

demise. The truth is that ranchers won't be disappearing anytime soon. Even in

the post-industrial age the ranching community still possesses significant

resources--vast quantities of land, and the leading role in America's

self-image as tough and pioneering. When these assets are combined, they create

tremendous political pull. As proof, look what happened to the Clinton

Administration's efforts, two years in a row, to raise the fees the government

charges for grazing on federal lands, virtually all of which lie in the eleven

continental states west of Texas, making up a third of that territory. Ranchers

who use federal land have long paid less than a third of the average

private-land rate, and the increase proposed by the Administration was slight.

Perhaps surprisingly, the group receiving this favor has always been a

relatively small player in the nation's beef industry: the eleven western

states produce less than a fifth of the nation's beef. Even so, western

ranching interests beat the Clinton team handily. No one now wants to fight

another losing battle with the rancher. Maybe he simply needs another set of

survival methods--ones better for both the ranching community and the public at

large.<p>



Tom Campbell's ranch sits in the heart of the John Day River Basin, a 536-mile

river network that constitutes one of the longest undammed systems in the

country. Fishery experts consider the John Day critical spawning grounds for

the Pacific Coast's wild salmon, a fish that is central to the identity of this

part of the country and whose decline throughout the Northwest has been making

local headlines since the 1970s. Salmon pose a challenge that previous species

in trouble never have--first because northwesterners care about them so

passionately, and second because solving the salmon's problems requires the

most drastic and complex changes that ranchers have faced in decades.<p>



Dams are the biggest bullies in salmon streams. (Often when dams were created,

builders included cement fish "ladders" to help salmon swim upstream from the

ocean during spawning season; strangely, they rarely put screens on the other

side, which would have kept young fish traveling back to the sea from being

chewed up in the turbines like hamburger.) However, now that salmon are in

peril, experts are scrutinizing every cause they can find. These include

logging, overfishing, ravenous seals and sea lions, water pollution, and,

finally, cattle tromping through upland spawning streams.<p>



</blockquote>

<img src="./cow.gif" hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="" border=0>

<blockquote>



Campbell would be happy to help migrating salmon if he could find an economical

way to do it. Unfortunately, being rough on rangeland streams is embedded in a

rancher's standard routine. Consider the conditions on Campbell's ranch in an

exceptionally wet year--1993, which saw the end of seven years of drought. One

day that year in late summer, when the range has normally turned dry and

yellow, many fields around the John Day were a thick green, and the John Day's

North Fork, which borders Campbell's property, ran full and wide. On the far

side of the river, where no cattle graze, the stream bed was in robust

health--lined with overhanging banks where fish hide, and shaded by willows and

other shrubbery, which keep the river cool and attract the insects fish eat.

The near side, along Campbell's pastureland, provided a different picture. This

shore had been grazed each year for decades, and the banks had long since been

trampled and eroded into wide, stony shallows.<p>

<pre>



</pre>

<font size=5>T</font>HE problem here, and on most western rangeland streams, is the beef cow's

table manners. Cattle aren't native to this country--they come from Europe,

where a wetter, greener, and more resilient landscape than that prevailing in

the West accustomed them to a sedentary grazing style, earning them the

nickname "vacuum feeders." Their American descendants are especially rude.

Heavily domesticated, safe from predators owing to the government's killing

program, the American beef cow behaves like a spoiled houseguest, frequently

hanging out along rangeland stream banks all day long. The West's native

grazers--primarily elk, deer, antelope, and bighorn sheep--eat in a roving,

less intensive manner. (Buffalo, which were quite rough on the land, ventured

into only Montana and Wyoming of the eleven western states.)<p>



By now the history and behavior of cattle have provoked an entire industry

dedicated to kicking them off public lands in the West. "The livestock industry

is the last wildlife-genocide program in the United States," says Bruce Apple,

the director of an Oregon-based environmental organization appropriately called

Rest the West. "All-out war is declared on a diversity of species every day to

benefit a single industry."<p>



To be fair, the crops ranchers raise for their cattle have actually been good

for some wildlife species, particularly big game such as elk, deer, and

antelope. It's some of the smaller inhabitants--birds, tortoises, and ferrets,

to name a few--that cattle have decimated. Yet the acrimony in this war, and

its costs and casualties to date, make one wonder whether the cowboy life has

simply become obsolete. On an ideal planet cattle would be restricted to our

green eastern states or returned to the greener continent from which they came,

leaving the arid West to the animals that are native to it. But the interlopers

are here now--about 45 million beef cattle roam some 870 million acres, more

than two thirds of the land mass in our seventeen westernmost states. These

animals live on roughly 200,000 cattle ranches. Many of the biggest are

financially marginal sideline investments run by wealthy enterprises, including

the Mormon Church, or by tycoons such as William Hewlett and David Packard, of

the Hewlett-Packard Corporation. Most, however, are run by small ranching

families whose primary asset is land the profitability of which is

questionable--for running cattle or doing anything else.<p>



One simple answer would be to fence cattle out of the streams--a step that

Campbell has taken along the most vulnerable mile of his riverbank. But fencing

every troubled stream won't work. The resulting labyrinth of barbed wire would

be harmful to wildlife, troublesome to maintain, and costly. Good fencing can

cost $8,000 to $12,000 a mile. And with every fence comes the cost of pumping

and piping replacement water to thirsty cattle--and the bureaucratic trouble.

Ironically, western-state water laws have traditionally encouraged ranchers to

skip all this and walk their cattle directly into fragile streams.<p>

 <pre> 

 </pre>

<font size=5>I</font>N search of solutions, I paid a visit to Clint Gray, a ranch manager known

around the valley for unusually ecological approaches to ranching. The

operation that Gray was running at the time (recently another ranch manager,

George Hixson, took it over) is unusual--there are no huge ranch headquarters,

no shops full of tractors and machinery, no stacks of hay. There are just a few

scattered buildings, including an old wooden house with a sagging front porch,

which sit in a small green basin high above the main valley. <p>



Gray first appeared on the doorstep of the ranch owner, Jim Bentley, one

November day seventeen years ago, frozen out of a nearby gold-mining camp and

looking for a home. Bentley let him stay in a broken-down cabin at the far

corner of what was then a 50,000-acre ranch, and Gray lived there alone for the

next few months, spending many hours studying the patterns of the animals and

the grasses out of ecological curiosity. Soon he was recruited for work on the

ranch, but the imprint remained of his months of watching the wild range. Now,

at fifty-two, he calls himself a "recovering hippie." About a decade ago, after

Bentley was forced to reduce his herd because of unrelated business losses,

Gray, by then the ranch manager, made his priority not beef production but

preserving the health of his boss's land--and gradually discovered a highly

effective method of running cattle. He was well suited to this role. His house

feels like the backwoods cabins of his past; the walls, made of barn siding,

are hung with spurs, branding irons, hay hooks, and a .30-30 rifle. Wood rasps

sit next to the cereal bowls in the kitchen cabinet. Bookshelves are filled

with titles like <i>The Organic Way to Plant Protection</i>, <i>Holistic

Resource Management</i>, and <i>The Knowledge Value Revolution</i>.<p>



All that remains of Bentley's old spread is 8,200 acres (now under new

ownership). Cattle graze every corner of this property, apparently without

hurting it. This is a rare feat, which Gray accomplished by employing three

surprisingly simple rules: Graze each field to its predetermined limit. Move

the cattle before the grass is overgrazed. Don't bring them back until the

plants are fully recovered. (Hixson now follows a similar routine.) <p>



The first morning of my visit Gray took me out to show me the network of

healthy wild grasses that can result from following his rules. Just beyond his

driveway we stopped at a plot of giant wild rye that stood six to eight feet

tall. In tales about the homesteading days in this basin cowboys ride through

grass reaching higher than their horses' shoulders. Almost nowhere can cowboys

do that today, but Gray believes that there were once many fields of giant rye

just like his. "Look at the function of this country on a planetary scale," he

told me. "Everyone is familiar with the rain forests. If you said they were the

lungs of the planet, people would relate to that. I look at the rangeland as

the planet's skin. Its function is two things--water circulation and soil

production." The water circulation occurs through the network of topsoil and

range grasses, which store and filter rainwater, letting it gradually seep

toward the rivers and oceans. Soil is produced by erosion--and by the action of

plants and microorganisms, such as rangeland mosses. A rock at our feet

provided an illustration: it cradled several lumps of moss, and when we pried

one loose, we found a small, damp pocket of sod, which the moss's acids had

created out of the rock itself. "The issue is how far does all this move? Does

it end up in the John Day River--or right here? The major player in that role

is the giant rye. It's the one plant that can flat-out stop soil movement."<p>



I soon had a chance to verify Gray's claims firsthand. That afternoon we were

hit with a typical high-desert summer storm, which pounded us with thick sheets

of rain and hail for more than an hour. Such downpours are notorious in this

country--they're nicknamed "gully washers," because of their tendency to carve

deep ravines where only a ditch existed hours before. This storm was no

exception: gravel roads were cut to pieces, some got washed out, and most

stream banks were ripped clean of new grasses. Once the storm had passed, Gray

and I ventured out to repeat the morning's tour.<p>



The air was spicy with the smell of sage, its leaf oils released by the beating

of the hail. Just below the house a roadside gully full of soupy red-brown

storm water had poured straight into Gray's stand of wild rye, carrying rocks

the size of my fist. After a few gushy steps into the foliage we could see no

further sign of rocks, or of mud. "Look at that," Gray said, smiling. "That

soil didn't go ten feet!" (Later Wayne Elmore, a riparian specialist with the

Bureau of Land Management, told me, "It's amazing how many people out here have

never seen that. It never even dawns on them that that can happen.") Farther on

we checked an old river gully. During our morning tour the gully had been dry

but lined with rushes, because cattle hadn't grazed the area since early

spring. When the storm brought its wash of mud, the rushes caught the whole

load. Gray was thrilled. "This is going to give us several more inches of soil

than was here a couple of hours ago," he said.<p>



A hundred yards downhill, across a fence, the ravine continued onto a

neighbor's property, where the soil was beaten into hardpan. The storm had

shaved it cleaner still, leaving behind none of the water, topsoil, or

promising seedlings that Gray had showed me. "It looks used, doesn't it?" the

neighbor, Clyde Davidson, said to me later. "I have to use this grass. This is

what I live on." Davidson's point was that Gray could afford to go easy on the

land, because he was drawing income from outside sources. Gray acknowledges

this fact. Half his income came from a tiny cottage industry he has run for

years: producing "twig beads" out of exotic woods. Only $20,000 a year, he

says, came from the ranch. <p>



Still, Gray believes that the average rancher can duplicate his efforts,

outside income or not. In fact, his seasonal routine soon built up so much

vegetation that the cattle could graze straight through most winters with only

a little supplementary hay, which he and Bentley bought. That meant they didn't

have to harvest hay anymore. Bentley sold his expensive haying equipment,

thereby cutting equipment and maintenance expenses dramatically. The ranch

needed less income, so Bentley never brought his herd back to its previous

size. As a result, the land continued to regain strength. Gray eventually was

able to run 300 pairs of mothers and calves, a comparatively healthy herd for

8,200 acres. In contrast, Clyde Davidson once ran only 200 pairs on a ranch of

about 13,000 acres. Much of the reason is that Davidson does not regularly move

his cattle. In range-management circles his is disparagingly called the

Columbus method of ranching: Turn your cattle out in the spring and discover

them in the fall.<p>

 <pre>

 </pre>

<font size=5>G</font>RAY'S scheme sounded so easy that I couldn't wait to return to Tom Campbell's

ranch to see how much of it would work there. The next day Campbell and I drove

across 45,000 acres, the swath of public and private land he ranches with four

partners.<p>



Like large parts of the West, this is rough terrain: rocky, deeply canyoned,

chaotically spread out, much of it harsh and dry--not nearly as forgiving as

the land that flourishes under Gray's rules. "That Cottonwood Ranch, it lays

right," Campbell said, referring to the larger piece of Bentley's property as

we jostled up the mountain in his four-wheel-drive truck. "There isn't a lot of

north slopes frozen up. Even though some of it's steep, they have pretty good

access to it. It's got county roads through it. If there's a problem, they can

see it. They're not stuck off here five miles, where you'd have to ride your

horses to get to it. You get some of these old cows out on the frozen hillsides

in the winter, you can't hardly drive 'em off. They're scared to go downhill.

I've fought whole bunches of cattle half a day to get 'em to go down a

frozen-up trail. If you put the dogs to 'em, you'd kill half of 'em."<p>



Campbell's point was that it's impossible for him and most western ranchers to

graze cattle through the winter. So he must maintain haying equipment and grow

hay--or buy it. The former owners of his land, he told me, once tried to

"winter out" but failed. "The weather's so unpredictable. A cow that's gonna

calve in the spring, she can go downhill to such a condition you can't stuff

enough hay in her to get her back where she'll produce a good calf."<p>



Passing judgment on the Tom Campbells of the world is tricky, because their

relationship with the range is so mixed. Campbell clearly loves the land: as we

tromped across one dry plateau, he stopped frequently to pick wildflowers, and

kept the tiny bouquet clutched in his thick hand for an hour. But he also

manages this land on a brutally thin margin. To keep costs down, he and his

partners employ only one cowboy to circulate 900 pairs of mothers and calves

through 45,000 acres. The effects of such thriftiness are visible. We finally

found the main herd near a water trough, where they'd been for days. Grasses in

the area were long gone, and the ground was trampled into thick black mud.

Similar scenes can be found on ranches throughout the West. According to

federal studies, 60 percent of the Bureau of Land Management's rangelands are

missing at least half their native plants and grasses, and could fare even

worse in the future.<p>



There is yet another approach to ranching, which aspires to combine Tom

Campbell's average-rancher constraints with Clint Gray's idealism. The

technique, which has a devoted following, is called holistic resource

management; it correctly assumes that most ranchers run cattle somewhat

haphazardly--overusing some spots, underusing others. The goal in HRM is to

search out and destroy every inefficiency, but with holistic ecological care.

This goal might better define HRM as home-run management, because its

practitioners can be seen constantly swinging for the fences. As one HRMer gave

me a tour, proudly showing off his unusually ambitious routine, it became clear

that so many tasks were falling through the cracks that the ranch was batting

only about .250. One field contained a portable fence designed to move cattle

frequently, but it was ineffective; after an hour or two the cows simply ambled

back to overgraze their old ground. Over the hill a stream that has long been

home to the salmon's cousin, the steelhead, was so beaten up that it looked

like an erosion ditch. "There have been some tremendous failures using HRM,"

Wayne Elmore, the BLM's riparian specialist, told me. "People heard you can

double your beef-production numbers. They didn't hear that you've got to watch

your grass and be with your cows every day." <p>



Even where federal land could easily be brought back to health by changes in

method, the changes are discouraged by the inertia of federal policy. At last

count the <A HREF="http://www.usgs.gov/doi/bureau-land-management.html">BLM</A>, which oversees 163 million acres of rangeland, had never visited

half of the most sensitive lands under its care. The record was even worse at

<A HREF="http://www.fs.fed.us/Homepage.html">the Forest Service.</A> When federal auditors checked on a small sample of the 104

million acres of grazing lands under Forest Service control, they found that

only 13 percent was being watched at all. As a result, most federal-land

ranchers operate in a way that is years, if not decades, out of date. "We're

still managing cows with 1960s thinking," Bill Platts, a consultant and former

Forest Service specialist in fishery-livestock interaction, told me. Even when

a rancher decides to rest a parcel, Platts says, he has seen federal regulators

pursuing their jobs by "beating the brush" to find someone else to run cattle

on it.<p>

<pre>



</pre>

<font size=5>A</font> REAL solution should begin with rewards and penalties that apply to both

public and private lands, since sensitive riverside lands and their wildlife

run through both. On federal lands government range managers should more

strictly control how many cattle graze each parcel, when and how long they're

there, and how much herbage they consume. Private property can be subject to

other pressures, such as the leverage that could be created through state or

local tax incentives and the dispersal of water rights. One federal law, the

Clean Water Act, already authorizes the government to penalize ranchers who

foul streams on private lands--a provision of the law that has almost never

been enforced.<p>



To make comprehensive regulation work, hundreds more BLM and Forest Service

regulators must get out and visit livestock ranches. This does not mean hiring

a flock of new bureaucrats. Many of the needed regulators are already on

staff--they're just bogged down in paperwork. Lyle Andrews, one of the BLM's

three rangeland managers in the John Day Basin, estimates that only 25 to 30

percent of their time is spent in the field. Last summer the Clinton

Administration tried to free up Andrews. It adopted new rules for the BLM that

should minimize paperwork, increase rangeland managers' powers, and let them

cooperate with a rancher who wants to rest a parcel of land from grazing.

Meanwhile, Republicans have countered with a plan of their own that would kill

Clinton's changes--and expand ranchers' authority.<p>



Perhaps it's a comment on human nature that the ranching community generally

despises government interference, considering itself a paragon of American

independence and self-sufficiency. As proof, some ranchers boast that theirs is

the only major agricultural industry that survives without a government

subsidy. "How can it be a subsidy when we're paying the government to use it?"

Alisa Harrison, a <A HREF="http://www.ncanet.org/">National Cattlemen's Association</A> spokesperson, asked me.

True, they don't enjoy the explicit price supports to which dairy and wheat

farmers have become addicted. Indirectly, however, almost every rancher is

subsidized in some way, resulting in expenses to the public of at least $100

million a year just in support of the eleven western states. <p>



The bulk of this subsidy falls into three categories. First there's the

discount ranchers get on leases of public lands--and the maintenance expenses

federal agencies must pick up as a result. These costs were conservatively

estimated at $52 million for 1990; more-aggressive tallies of the grazing

programs' full administrative overhead have totaled up a price of $200 million

or more a year. The second big subsidy is what the government calls an

"emergency feed program," supposedly reserved for times of drought, but now

handed out habitually, even during wet years. This program has cost an average

of $26.5 million annually in these states for the past decade. Finally there's

<A HREF="http://www.aphis.usda.gov/adc/">"animal damage control,"</A> the government's predator-killing program. In 1994

this program cost $55.9 million nationwide, of which roughly $22 million was

spent on western livestock operations. The animals killed nationwide with this

money included 163 black bears, 293 mountain lions, 1,928 bobcats, 8,973 foxes,

and 85,571 coyotes. Presumably, such substantial government support of various

kinds justifies holding ranchers accountable.<p>



The government could use its subsidies to encourage other pursuits, such as

rebuilding the wilderness. Jim Nelson, a Nevada Forest Service supervisor, has

concluded that ranchers could raise as much beef as they do today on half as

much land if they spent several decades managing it more carefully, giving some

spots a complete rest. A forty-year time-out might strike some ranchers as

unrealistic, but there are other ways to stay occupied. The 

marketing of

outdoor recreation rights is one option. Throughout the West some ranchers

already make as much money on their private lands by selling high-priced rights

to hunt revived herds of wild elk, deer, and antelope, or returning flocks of

turkey and quail, as they do running cattle. <p>



Some experts suggest that abolishing subsidies could actually help the range,

as ranchers lose the extra feed and other supports that have encouraged them to

overstock their pasturelands. Some combination of the 

<A HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~rot/business.html">free-market 

approach</A> and

a long rest may be ideal, but it's politically unrealistic right now. <p>



Whatever step is taken next, it should begin with regulations that confront the

work still to be done on the range--and that charge

 full market 

 rates for

public leases. At that point ranchers' adaptability could realistically be

tested. Though it would help to know whether the rancher and the cowboy are

really obsolete, the verdict is not yet in. The only way to arrive at one is to

let ranchers face their true costs. Obviously, new expenses will force many out

of business. When that time comes, the public can make its choice: increase the

subsidy to preserve this rare but resonant icon of American identity, or decide

that change is inevitable, and that ranchers like Tom Campbell must go the way

of the horse and buggy. "If we really had a market environment, we'd lose

people quicker, more efficiently," says Ed Chaney, an Idaho-based rangeland and

watershed consultant. "But now, with our subsidy, we're just feeding the

problem. The system now is slow attrition, grinding them out of the industry.

The dollar cost of keeping them out there is mind-boggling." <p>
